The blade was thin enough to strike through the gaps between armour plates. This weapon was used to dispatch knights who had received mortal wounds, which were not always quickly fatal in the age of bladed combat; it could also be used as a means of killing an active adversary, as during a grappling struggle. The blade could be pushed through the visor or eye holes in the helm with the aim of piercing the brain, or thrust through holes or weak points in plate armor, such as under the arm, with the aim of piercing the heart.

The glider is slipping slightly nose-left. Coordinated flight can be restored by the pilot applying pressure to the right rudder pedal. The T√ºrk Yƒ±ldƒ±zlarƒ± performing a coordinated turn. In team aerobatics the notion is especially important, as sideslip may likely result in an in-flight collision. In aviation, coordinated flight of an aircraft is flight without sideslip.Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, Section 14.6 When an aircraft is flying with zero sideslip a turn and bank indicator installed on the aircraft's instrument panel usually shows the ball in the center of the spirit level. The occupants perceive no lateral acceleration of the aircraft and their weight to be acting straight downward into their seats. Particular care to maintain coordinated flight is required by the pilot when entering and leaving turns.Transport Canada: Flight Training Manual, 4th edition, page 9. Gage Publishing, 1994. Advantages Coordinated flight is usually preferred over uncoordinated flight for the following reasons: *it is more comfortable for the occupants *it minimises the drag force on the aircraft *it causes fuel to be drawn equally from tanks in both wings *it minimises the risk of entering a spin Instrumentation Airplanes and helicopters are usually equipped with a turn and bank indicator to provide their pilots with a continuous display of the lateral balance of their aircraft so the pilots can ensure coordinated flight. Glider pilots attach a piece of coloured string to the outside of the canopy to sense the sideslip angle and assist in maintaining coordinated flight. Axes of rotation An airplane has three axes of rotation: #Pitch ‚Äì in which the nose of the airplane moves up or down. This is typically controlled by the elevator at the rear of the airplane. #Yaw ‚Äì in which the nose of the airplane moves left or right. This is typically controlled by the rudder at the rear of the airplane. #Roll (bank) ‚Äì in which one wing of the airplane moves up and the other moves down. This is typically controlled by ailerons on the wings of the airplane. Coordinated flight requires the pilot to use pitch, roll and yaw control simultaneously. See also flight dynamics. Coordinating the turn If the pilot were to use only the rudder to initiate a turn in the air, the airplane would tend to \\"skid\\" to the outside of the turn. Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, Section 14.7 If the pilot were to use only the ailerons to initiate a turn in the air, the airplane would tend to \\"slip\\" toward the lower wing. If the pilot were to fail to use the elevator to increase the angle of attack throughout the turn, the airplane would also tend to \\"slip\\" toward the lower wing. However, if the pilot makes appropriate use of the rudder, ailerons and elevator to enter and leave the turn such that sideslip and lateral acceleration are zero the airplane will be in coordinated flight.

The team is notable for being a founding member of the National Hockey Association, the predecessor to the National Hockey League. Established to capitalize on the then-current mining boom in northern Ontario, it became clear that the town was too small to support major professional hockey, and the team left the NHA after its inaugural season. History The Haileybury club was founded in 1906 as one of the teams of the Timiskaming Professional Hockey League (TPHL), a collection of teams sponsored by local mine owners. The club was owned by the O'Brien family, based in Renfrew, Ontario which owned silver mines, railways and railway construction companies. The TPHL existed as entertainment for the miners in the remote towns of northern Ontario, the teams playthings for the owners to bet extravagantly on. In 1909, Haileybury earned notoriety in ice hockey circles, luring professional players such as Con Corbeau, Skene Ronan and Harry Smith away from teams in the Ontario Professional Hockey League (OPHL) and the Eastern Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (ECHA). At the time, mine owners made large wagers on the play of the teams in the league and O'Brien could afford to entice players to break contracts and join Haileybury. When the Federal League Renfrew Creamery Kings team failed to join the new Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) in November 1909, Ambrose O'Brien organized the National Hockey Association and included Haileybury and his other TPHL team the Cobalt Silver Kings in the league, along with the Montreal Wanderers, Les Canadiens and Renfrew, which he had to buy so as to enter the team in the NHA. In 1910, Haileybury's one season in the NHA, their record was four wins and eight losses, scoring 77 goals for and 83 goals against. Notable players included Alex Currie, Art Ross, Paddy Moran and Skene Ronan. Haileybury's leading scorer was Horace Gaul with 22 goals, good for seventh in the NHA that season. After the 1910 season, the club's owner, Renfrew mining tycoon Ambrose O'Brien withdrew Haileybury from the NHA. The TPHL was resurrected and Haileybury resumed play in the TPHL for the 1910‚Äì11 season, the final season of the TPHL, afterwards continuing in the Timiskaming Senior League until 1915. The Haileybury NHA franchise itself was transferred to Montreal wrestler and sports promoter George Kennedy, owner of the \\"Club Athl√©tique Canadien\\", who took over the Montreal Canadiens hockey club. Kennedy claimed rights to the \\"Canadiens\\" name and threatened to sue O'Brien over the use of the name by O'Brien's 'Les Canadiens' club. In an unusual settlement, Kennedy took over the Haileybury franchise rather than the Canadiens franchise and O'Brien kept the Montreal franchise. The Les Canadiens players and name were transferred to Kennedy.Young(1967), p. 74 References  ;Notes Category:Defunct ice hockey teams in Canada Category:National Hockey Association teams Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1906 Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 1915 Category:Ice hockey teams in Ontario Category:Temiskaming Shores Category:Sport in Northern Ontario Category:1906 establishments in Ontario Category:1915 disestablishments in Ontario ","title":"Haileybury Comets"},{"id":"5066869","text":"Walter Joseph Karbo (August 14, 1915 ‚Äì March 23, 1993) was an American professional wrestling promoter and co-founder of the American Wrestling Association with Verne Gagne.

He was born and raised in northeast Minneapolis and graduated from De La Salle High school in 1934. He went to work as an assistant to Minneapolis boxing and wrestling promoter Tony Stecher in the 1930s. He eventually became a referee for wrestling matches and then evolved into a promoter.

On October 9, 1954, Tony Stecher died and control of the promotion passed to Karbo and Dennis Stecher. In 1959, Dennis Stecher sold his majority stake in the Minneapolis Boxing and Wrestling club to Karbo and Gagne. They became co-owners of the promotion from that point onward. Breaking away from the National Wrestling Alliance, he and Gagne established the AWA in 1960 and together operated the promotion for over thirty years. He would also appear as an on-air personality hosting the AWA's Saturday morning television show All-Star Wrestling before Karbo sold his interests to Gagne in 1985.

Version 3 and later are standalone programs; earlier versions were plugins for Adobe Photoshop. FITS Liberator is free software released under the BSD-3 license. The engine behind the FITS Liberator is NASA's CFITSIO library. FITS has been a standard since 1982 and is recognized by the International Astronomical Union. While not limited solely to image data, archives in the FITS file format include images of stars, nebulae and galaxies produced by space-based and ground-based telescopes from around the world. Although the first version of the software was an excellent tool used mainly by professional astronomers, efforts have been made to bring high quality astronomical images to the homes of amateur astronomers, educators and students. The FITS Liberator has become the industry standard for professional imaging scientists at the European Space Agency, the European Southern Observatory and NASA. It uses images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), among others, to craft beautiful colour astronomical images. The first and second versions of the FITS Liberator were released in July 2004 and August 2005 respectively. The latest version, v3.0.1, was released in February 2012 and is available for download at the European homepage of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. FITS Liberator v3.0.1 is a stand-alone product and Adobe Photoshop is no longer required for its use. Version 1 Screenshot FITS Liberator Version 1 Version 1 of the ESA/ESO/NASA Photoshop FITS Liberator was completed in July 2004 by imaging scientists at the European Space Agency, the European Southern Observatory and NASA. Version 1 allowed all types of FITS images to be opened and also some limited interaction with the images. Version 2 # The preview window # Histogram # Tools # Statistics # Advanced tools for scaling and stretch Screenshot FITS Liberator Version 2 (circled numbers indicate workflow within the user interface) The basic workflow is to open a FITS image, study it in the Preview window, adjust the black-and-white levels (6) to give a reasonable contrast and then set the input range for the scaling of the image by clicking the Auto Scaling Button (7). Now, different values of the Scaled Peak level can be tested to scale the image to better fit with one of the possible Stretch functions (8). Version 2 of the ESA/ESO/NASA Photoshop FITS Liberator image processing software made it both easier and faster to create colour images from raw observations. Updates included: * FITS images with up to 4 billion grey scales can be processed (32 bit support). * FITS images with up to 500 million pixels or more can be processed (100 times larger than standard images from a digital camera). * Re-designed workflow and user interface. The plug-in remembers previous settings. * New options for advanced scaling and stretching. An entire section of v2.0 was dedicated to metadata input and the user also had access to a text version of the original FITS header. Screenshot FITS Liberator Version 2.1 With the advent of the FITS Liberator v2.0, it became possible for people at home to create spectacular pictures like the iconic Hubble image ‚ÄúPillars of Creation‚Äù in a matter of minutes. An updated version of the software containing new scaling and stretching tools is available that allows better manipulation of astronomical images. An update in v2.1 is the ability for users to embed descriptive information about the image and what it shows directly within the final image. Based on a new standard for Astronomy Visualization Metadata, this information is stored in the standard manner comparable to that used by digital cameras to record exposure information. The ESA/ESO/NASA WFPC2 Mosaicator: This new add- on tool works on Hubble WFPC2 images. It will generate a single WFPC2 mosaic file from one WFPC2 file containing four CCD images in individual planes.

During his lifetime, he had at least four sets of dentures made to replace them. Natural teeth In 1756, when Washington was 24 years old, a dentist pulled his first tooth. According to his diary, he paid 5 shillings to a \\"Doctr Watson\\" for the removal. His diary also regularly mentioned troubles such as aching teeth and lost teeth. John Adams says he lost his teeth because he used them to crack Brazil nuts; modern historians have suggested that mercury oxide, which Washington was given to treat illnesses such as smallpox and malaria, probably contributed to the loss. On April 30, 1789, the date of his presidential inauguration, although he had mostly dentures, he had only one remaining natural tooth, a premolar. During that same year, he began wearing full dentures. Washington's last tooth was given as a gift and keepsake to his dentist John Greenwood. Dentures 250px During his lifetime, Washington had four sets of dentures. He began wearing partial dentures by 1781. Despite many people believing they were made of wood, they contained no wood. They were actually made of other materials such as hippopotamus ivory, brass, or gold. The dentures had metal fasteners, springs to force them open, as well as bolts to keep them together. Washington's dentures were likely stolen from the teeth of slaves. Records at Mount Vernon show that he bought teeth from slaves. The poor and enslaved had been selling teeth as a means of making money since the Middle Ages, which were sold as dentures or implants to those of financial means. During the Revolution, French dentist Jean Pierre Le Moyer provided services in tooth transplantation. In May of 1784, Washington paid several unnamed slaves 122 shillings for a total of nine teeth to be implanted by a French doctor, who became a frequent guest on the plantation over the next few years. While it is unconfirmed that these purchased teeth were for Washington himself, his payment for them suggests that were in fact for his use, as does a comment from a letter to his wartime clerk Richard Varick: \\"I confess I have been staggered in my belief in the efficacy of transplantion,\\" he wrote. Washington used teeth sourced from slaves to improve his appearance, a subject of frequent discomfort to him.Mary V. Thompson, \\"The Private Life of George Washington's Slaves\\", Frontline, PBS He took the oath of office while wearing a special set of dentures made from ivory, brass and gold built for him by dentist John Greenwood.Washington's face in the Athenaeum Portrait and the one-dollar bill. According to his diaries, Washington's dentures disfigured his mouth and often caused him pain, for which he took laudanum. Washington once wrote that his lips would \\"bulge\\" in an unnatural way. This distortion is noticeable on his image on the one-dollar bill, an image taken from the Athenaeum Portrait, a 1796 unfinished painting by Gilbert Stuart. He once wrote to his dentist, Greenwood, to avoid modifying the dentures \\"which will, in the least degree force the lips out more than now do, as it does this too much already.\\" Apart from the disfiguration caused by the dentures, the distress may also be apparent in many of the portraits painted while he was still in office. He spent constant effort maintaining his dentures, and often had them shipped to Greenwood, for maintenance. The mistaken belief that Washington's dentures were wooden was widely accepted by 19th century historians and appeared as fact in school textbooks until well into the 20th century. The possible origin of this myth is that the ivory teeth quickly became stained and may have had the appearance of wood to observers. A letter from Greenwood to Washington in 1798 advised more thorough cleaning since: \\"the sett you sent me from Philadelphia...was very black...Port wine being sower takes of[f] all the polish\\". The only existing complete set of Washington's dentures are owned by the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, who own and operate George Washington's estate in Fairfax County, Virginia. There is another complete, original, lower jaw denture dated 1795 at the National Museum of Dentistry, Baltimore, Maryland. Dentists John Greenwood, one of Washington's dentists At least three of Washington's dentists are identified. His diary mentions \\"Doctr Watson\\", the dentist who pulled his first tooth. His personal dentist and friend was Jean-Pierre Le Mayeur. John Greenwood of New York City made and maintained his dentures.

However, he has broken a number of stories that have been picked up by mainstream publications, including many reports of actors who have appeared in gay porn (Simon Rex, for example). Faye Dunaway has been a frequent target with a feature Billy calls \\"Fayewatch\\" - usually chronicling her diva demands and misdeeds. Masters is often quoted on Page Six of the New York Post, and is frequently featured in such publications as People, Entertainment Weekly, The Village Voice, Us Weekly, Playbill, etc. He is a regular guest on radio and television talk shows, getting his start on the Joan Rivers Show, People Are Talking (Tom Bergeron), and Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. As a performer, Masters acts, sings and does stand-up. He often donates his time to a variety of charities and benefits, including many gay pride celebrations and AIDS Benefits. The Internet Movie Database lists him as an actor in the film The Brinks Job and the television series Spenser: For Hire. He's also featured in hereTV's World AIDS Day Special, We're Here To Remember. In 2004, he filmed two talk show pilots, The Billy Masters Show and Deep Dish, both of which are listed as in development. And in 2006, he appeared as a celebrity judge alongside Chi Chi LaRue and Bruce Vilanch in All Worlds Studio's Fucking with the Stars. Masters keeps busy as a stand-up comedian and has opened for a variety of other comedians and musical acts, including Taylor Dayne, George Michael, Tiffany, Joan Rivers, the Pointer Sisters, Joy Behar, Eartha Kitt, and Grace Jones. He often refers to Joan Rivers not only as his strongest influence, but as a comedic mentor. In an interview, he said: \\"Joan Rivers was my first real guide, my comedic godmother. She told me if you bomb, get back up on that stage. If you can't get back up there, then you didn't deserve to be there in the first place. That, and she taught me to be very careful about swearing for a laugh. Take the swear out of the joke, she said. If you can still get a laugh, then it's funny. If you need the swear to get the laugh, the joke stinks!\\" In May 2008, Billy Masters performed a limited run of \\"Going Out On A Limb: Confessions of a Hollywood Insider\\" at Chicago's Bailiwick Repertory Theatre. At the time, Billy was in Chicago for the Grabby Awards and International Mr . Leather. In April 2020, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Masters launched \\"Billy Masters LIVE\\", a twice weekly online talk show. It streams live on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3PM Eastern on his YouTube Channel, Billy Masters TV. During the first three weeks, his guests have included Fran Drescher, Jenifer Lewis, Charles Busch, Steve Kmetko, Andrea Martin, Marc Shaiman, Bruce Vilanch, Lainie Kazan, and many others. On Facebook, Billy responded to one fan, \\"I realize this might as well be called 'Billy Masters and Friends', because the only people I've had on are people I have a personal relationship with and absolutely love. That's probably why it has such a relaxed tone and the guests feel free to talk about things they wouldn't on other shows. The other factor is the chemistry between people. It is really like evesdropping on a group of actual friends.\\"  References  Category:1969 births Category:American male comedians Category:Writers from Somerville, Massachusetts Category:Gay writers Category:Living people Category:LGBT writers from the United States Category:Comedians from Massachusetts Category:21st-century American comedians ","title":"Billy Masters (columnist)"},{"id":"5066934","text":"Roscommon was a parliamentary constituency represented in D√°il √âireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament or Oireachtas from 1923 to 1969 and from 1981 to 1992.

His estate in what was then York, Upper Canada, gave its name to Rosedale, Toronto. Jarvis Street was named for his cousin, Samuel. Birth Born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, he was the son of United Empire Loyalists from Danbury, Connecticut and named for his father's friend, William Botsford. His father, Lt-Colonel Stephen Jarvis (1756‚Äì1840) of the 17th Regiment of Light Dragoons, became Adjutant-General to the Forces in Upper Canada and Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod to the Parliament of Canada. Colonel Jarvis had fought with the British during the American Revolutionary War, but was captured by the Americans in his home town at Connecticut. He escaped in a canoe to Long Island, rejoining the British forces there. After the war he joined some cousins in New Brunswick, where William was born, before being persuaded to move to York, Upper Canada in 1809 by one of them, 'the incompetent and dishonest' William Jarvis. Business and politics William Botsford Jarvis had 'a gregarious and outgoing personality'. He founded Yorkville, Toronto, with the entrepreneur Joseph Bloor, and he was involved in the incorporation of a number of companies in the Toronto area, including the Victoria Mining Company in 1856. In 1827, he was the choice of the Family Compact to be Sheriff of the Home District, and was duly elected. In 1837, as sheriff, he stopped William Lyon Mackenzie and his rebels during Upper Canada Rebellion from entering York, Upper Canada, forcing them back to engage at the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern. After the rebellion was repressed, he presided over the executions of Peter Matthews and Samuel Lount, even though it was Lount who had stopped the rebels burning Jarvis's home. Mackenzie and Jarvis were bitter enemies, and Mackenzie was intent on burning Rosedale to the ground, but Jarvis' wife and two of her sick children were in the house, and it was Lount who declared to the rebels that he was not there to fight women and sick children. Jarvis served as sheriff until 1856. In 1830, he was elected to the 11th Parliament of Upper Canada for the town of York, Upper Canada; he was defeated in 1834. He was elected to the town council for Toronto in 1841, but resigned the following year. Jarvis died at his home, Rosedale, in 1864. Rosedale Veterans of the War of 1812 at \\"Rosedale\\", Jarvis' estate, on 23 October 1861 The Rosedale district of Toronto was named after Jarvis' residence, Rosedale House, that formerly occupied that space. The house, which overlooked Castle Frank Brook, a tributary of the Don River, was \\"a wonderful rambling villa perched on the edge of a ravine... with a wildflower garden, a conservatory full of hothouse flowers, and, the envy of Toronto, a magnificent curving double staircase that descended to a foyer panelled in richest walnut.\\" Two new wings were added to either side of the house c.1830 containing a peach house, a grape house, bedrooms, a morning room and a large verandah. Orchards, quiet arbours, rose gardens and masses of flowers surrounded the house, which was named by Jarvis' wife Mary, granddaughter of William Dummer Powell, for the wild roses that grew so abundantly throughout the estate. Family William Jarvis married Mary Boyles Powell (1803‚Äì1852), in 1828. She was brought up by her grandfather, Chief Justice William Dummer Powell, and his wife, Anne Murray. The Jarvis' were the parents of five children: *Anne Frances Jarvis (1830‚Äì1919), married Edmund Allen Meredith, for whom Meredith Crescent in Rosedale is named. *Louisa Jarvis (1831-1906), married (Daniel) Augustus Nanton (1831-1873), and were the parents of Sir Augustus Meredith Nanton. *Lt.-Colonel William Dummer Jarvis (1834‚Äì1914) of the 12th York Rangers and afterwards the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. He married Margaret, daughter of William Parker Ranney H.E.I.C.S., of Topsham, Devon. *Sarah Harriet Jarvis (1836-1897), married in 1854 Lewis William Ord, a first cousin of Major- General Sir Harry St. George Ord, and the son of Major Robert Hutchinson Ord (1789‚Äì1829) D.L., of Greenstead Hall, Essex, formerly of the King's Hussars. *Lt.-Colonel Robert Edward Colborne Jarvis (1842-1903) of the 67th Leinster Regiment. He was attached to the Staff College at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He then served with the Red Cross Ambulance Corps throughout the Franco-Prussian War, and was awarded by the French government in recognition of his services with one of only two gold crosses made. He served on the staff of Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, and was one of the lucky few to survive the infamous withdrawal through the Khyber Pass. He later served in South Africa. Though 'an elegant young man, a very lady-killer', he died unmarried.

He was known for being a pioneering black umpire, for his longtime weight problems, and for his controversial home plate umpiring in Game 5 of the 1997 National League Championship Series‚Äîwhen his generous strike zone helped the Florida Marlins' Liv√°n Hern√°ndez strike out 15 Atlanta batters.New York Times, June 6, 2006 https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/06/sports/06gregg.html Throughout his National League career, Gregg wore uniform number 7. Umpiring career Gregg was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His major league career began at the age of 24, making him one of the youngest umpires in big league history. He was only the third black umpire in the big leagues, following Emmett Ashford and Art Williams. He officiated in the 1989 World Series, and was the third base umpire for Game 3, which was postponed due to the Loma Prieta earthquake, but since the series ended in four games, he did not get to work behind home plate, as happened to Ashford in the 1970 World Series. He also worked in four National League Championship Series (1981, 1987, 1991, 1997), as well as the 1995 and 1996 National League Division Series and the 1986 All- Star Game at the Houston Astrodome. He was the home plate umpire for two no- hitters (Terry Mulholland in 1990 and Ram√≥n Mart√≠nez in 1995) and worked third base for Tom Browning's perfect game on September 16, 1988. On August 8, 1988, Gregg was the home plate umpire for the first night game at Wrigley Field. The Phillies and Cubs were rained out and the first official game was played August 9, 1988. Gregg was the subject of controversy for his large strike zone during Game 5 of the 1997 NLCS, where Marlins pitcher Livan Hernandez recorded a career high 15 strikeouts against Atlanta. His work in the game was voted by Baseball America as the third-worst umpire performance of the 1975‚Äì2000 era. Gregg continued to umpire in 1998 and a portion of the 1999 season, but was not selected for post season duties again. =Resignation= Gregg was one of 22 umpires who resigned in as part of a labor action. Richie Phillips, executive director of the umpires' union, felt that Major League Baseball might reconsider its stance in contract negotiations rather than doling out millions of dollars in severance pay. Instead, the MLB chose to accept the resignations, though they later rehired several of those who had resigned. On August 7, 2001, Rep. Robert A. Brady, a member of the United States House of Representatives, wrote a letter with 25 other House members urging Commissioner Bud Selig to rehire Gregg, but Selig refused. Weight problems Gregg battled weight troubles throughout his career, eventually leading to his famous nickname \\"The Plump Ump\\". His weight was generally listed between 315 and 325 pounds, but Gregg admitted that this was often an understatement and that he frequently approached 400 pounds. In , fellow umpire John McSherry died in Cincinnati of a heart attack; the two had planned for a long time to try to lose weight together, but McSherry's death motivated Gregg to take a leave of absence from umpiring and enter a program at Duke University. Actor Bill Murray once quipped about Gregg that \\"he looked like the Michelin Man. If he had to haul ass right now, he'd have to make about 6 trips.\\" His frame, still hefty and recognizable despite the weight loss, encouraged publicity for Gregg. He was honorary commissioner of the Wing Bowl, an annual competitive eating event in Philadelphia, and also umped at various celebrity softball events. He also occasionally worked at Chickie's & Pete's Philadelphia restaurant and at the restaurant's stand at Veterans Stadium as a bartender and server. Aside from his girth, he was also well known for his jocular personality and wide smile, which had a disarming effect on game participants who took issue with his calls. In 1999, he was fined $5,000 by the National League for exceeding a 300-pound weight limit. Personal life On December 31, 1974, he married Conchita Camilo, with whom he had four children. His autobiography, Working the Plate (written with Marty Appel), was published in 1990. Gregg's son Kevin has worked with numerous sports teams in the public relations department, and currently serves with the Boston Red Sox as Vice President of Media Relations. Son Eric Joseito was well-known as a lacrosse coach before becoming an account executive at Dell EMC in the Philadelphia area. Gregg's daughter Ashley Gabrielle was named for Ashley Abbott of the Sony Pictures Television daytime drama The Young and the Restless. Gregg mentioned in his autobiography that umpires who usually work night games were prone to watch network television dramas; a photo of him with Eileen Davidson is in the book. Eric and Conchita have another son, Jamie. =Death= Gregg suffered a stroke at age 55 on June 4, 2006 and died the following day.

As the Furies traveled to a museum in Turkey, they were ambushed by Trevor and his strike force, the Oddfellows. Stompa escaped alongside Bernadeth and Gilotina, reporting their failure back to Darkseid.Wonder Woman #41 (2018) Much later, Stompa attended the birth of Jacob, Mister Miracle and Big Barda's son, alongside the other Furies, but the whole scenario was just an illusion that Mister Miracle had while trapped in the Omega Sanction. Mister Miracle #7 (2018) Mister Miracle #12 (2018) Powers and abilities Stompa is a massive woman and the most powerful member of the Female Furies. Her powers are based on the use of super strength, resistance and a high level of invulnerability. Stompa is strong enough to lift more than 70 tons and can jump great distances. In addition, Stompa is a formidable warrior, in combat uses anti-matter boots that enhance the incredible strength of her legs. She uses her anti-matter boots to crush her victims, and can create earthquakes or tremors by stomping onto the ground.

Stompa threw Wonder Woman's body into the fiery pits. When the Furies reported back to Darkseid, he was displeased that they had killed her rather than executing her publicly. Wonder Woman, still alive, managed to save her sisters.

Baiheliang (Simplified: ÁôΩÈπ§Ê¢Å, Traditional: ÁôΩÈ∂¥Ê¢Å, Pinyin: B√°ih√®li√°ng, lit. \\"White Crane Ridge\\") is a rock outcrop in Fuling District, Chongqing, People's Republic of China, that parallels the flow of the Yangtze River. In the past, Baiheliang served as an ancient device for measuring water levels of the Yangtze in China, the equivalent of a hydrometric station. The horizontal rock ledge, 1.6 km long and ten to fifteen metres wide, lay submerged under water most of the year, showing its upper face above water only during the low-water season of winter and early spring. The eyes of fish carved on the stone indicate the lowest water levels of the Yangtze River, which made the site a precious hydrographic marker. Baiheliang has been submerged to a depth of over 30 metres behind the Three Gorges Dam.\\"Accident-maker reef no longer threatens Yangtze navigation\\" , ThreeGorgesProbe.org. Engraved in the rock are 163 inscriptions and pictures, which include 114 hydrological annotations,Baiheliang: Ancient Hydrologic Station, China.org.cn, 2003. which give detailed records of water levels in the river over 1,200 years, since the first year of the Tang dynasty Guangde era, 763; the assembled inscriptions and fish carvings, taken together, formed the longest such sequence in the world. One fish carving originally carved in the Tang dynasty was re-carved at a moment of lowest water in 1685: modern measurements recorded the elevation of their eyes, 137.91 metres, almost the same as that of the zero point of the modern water level gauge. The fish carvings and hydrological inscriptions were virtually unknown in the West until the 1970s, when Chinese experts presented photos of these two fish and hydrological data of Fuling for the past 1,200 years at an international hydrological symposium held in the UK. The best-known of the fish carvings was a 2.8-metre carp, carved from a section of freestone. Hundreds of poetical homages to the place were inscribed in rock faces, which have disappeared beneath the rising waters as the dam has been completed. In 2003, Xinhua News Agency, the People's Republic's official press agency, headlined the on-line story, June 10, \\"Accident-maker reef no longer threatens Yangtze navigation\\".

The traveling team has operated intermittently throughout the league's history, usually being activated in years when the league otherwise has an odd number of teams. History The original plan was for the team to be known as the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds, based in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, where a planned a 5,000-seat stadium called the Lehigh Valley Multi-Purpose Sport Complex in Williams Township near Easton, Pennsylvania, was slated to be completed by 1999. In the interim, the team played the league's inaugural 1998 season as the Newburgh Black Diamonds at Delano-Hitch Stadium in Newburgh, New York. However, the owners of the Lehigh Valley complex and the team filed for bankruptcy and left the stadium unfinished. Rather than stay in Newburgh, the league took over the franchise and transformed it into a traveling team. In 2000, the team played in a small ballpark in Quakertown, Pennsylvania, with little to no fan support. One game had a paid attendance of two people. Former Cincinnati Reds third baseman Wayne Krenchicki managed the team from 1998 to 2000 before becoming the manager of the Camden Riversharks from 2001 to 2006. The Lehigh Valley Multi-Purpose Sport Complex was demolished in early 2005, without ever hosting a single baseball game. The team was renamed the Pennsylvania Road Warriors for the 2002-2004 seasons. In 2005, the Lancaster Barnstormers took the place of the Road Warriors. When the Nashua Pride left to join the Can-Am League, the league re-established the Road Warriors for the 2006 season to replace the Pride. With the move of the Atlantic City Surf to the Can-Am League for the 2007 season, the Road Warriors remained to fill the gaps in the schedule until the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs joined in 2008. The Road Warriors returned in 2011 to fill in scheduling holes left by the departing Newark Bears and in 2018 as part of the Bridgeport Bluefish's relocation to High Point, North Carolina; that relocation was scheduled to be completed before the 2019 season. They were to be activated again for the 2020 season following the departure of the New Britain Bees to the Futures Collegiate Baseball League, but did not compete as the season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2004 Pennsylvania Road Warriors finished with the worst record in Atlantic League history at 23‚Äì103. The Road Warriors' 2007 season proved to be their most successful as they finished at 43‚Äì83. Contributing to the team's disadvantage is the Atlantic League does not grant the team any \\"designated\\" home games, meaning they never receive the home field advantage other teams have, so must always hit first. (This is in contrast to Major League Baseball policy, which grants \\"designated home\\" status to teams forced to move games to their opponent's stadium.) There have been two players to make it to Major League Baseball after suiting up for the Road Warriors. Catcher Robinson Cancel appeared in 19 games for the 2003 Road Warriors before making it back to MLB in 2008 with the New York Mets. Pitcher Alberto Castillo also made it to the major leagues with the Baltimore Orioles. Castillo pitched for the Road Warriors in 2006 and 2007 before being invited to spring training with the Orioles in 2008. Castillo quickly pitched his way up the system and appeared in 28 games with the O's going 1‚Äì0 with a 3.81 ERA and 23 strikeouts.

These islands include Peaks Island, Little Diamond Island, Great Diamond Island, Diamond Cove, Long Island, Chebeague Island and Cliff Island. The company has a fleet of five vessels. Schedules to the islands vary seasonally. During the summer months, many more ferry trips go back and forth to the islands, while there are significantly fewer trips during the winter. History The Casco Bay Lines ferry Maquoit II, passing Peaks Island on the mail boat run down the bay. The Casco Bay Steamboat Company began providing permanent year-round service to Casco Bay Islands in 1878. In 1881 the Harpswell Line began providing regular service to the outer bay islands. The lines merged in 1907 as the Casco Bay and Harpswell Steamboat Company. The company shut down in July 1919 as a direct result of World War I. A smaller company named Casco Bay Lines was formed that winter. CBITD is a non-profit organization that was established through emergency State legislation in 1981. CBITD acquired CBL assets through bankruptcy proceedings to ensure the continuation of transportation service between their primary terminal hub in Portland, Maine and the islands of Casco Bay. CBITD is governed by a board of 12 directors, 10 of whom are elected from the island communities. One is appointed by the City of Portland; another is appointed by the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Transportation. Many workers from the island communities depend on CBITD to get them to work every day and to take them home. All school children who live on the islands have to use CBITD service to get back and forth to school (this applies to 6th grade and up.) There is a car ferry that services Peaks Island and a freight ferry that services all of the \\"down bay\\" islands (Long Island, Chebeague Island, and Cliff Island.) The signature color patterns of the Casco Bay Lines fleet is (from bottom up): black, yellow, white, and red. Casco Bay Lines was once located at Custom House Wharf but was moved in the 1980s to its current location on the Maine State Pier. When the company was first established it used steamboats to transport its cargo. Some of the more famous steamboats included the Aucocisco, Maquoit, and Machigonne. Its first ferry was the Abenaki, which operated on Casco Bay for nearly five decades. The Portland Ferry terminal received a substantial renovation and addition in 2014 designed by Scott Simons Architects.

It speaks to me of faithful service, of duty well done, of friendships cemented by dangers and hardships and sufferings shared in common in camp and in the field. But, sir, it also speaks to me of bloodshed - possibly some of it unavoidably innocent - in defense of loved ones, of homes; homes in many cases but huts of grass, yet cherished none the less. It speaks of raids and burnings, of many prisoners taken, and like vile beasts, thrown in the foulest of prisons. And for what? For fighting for their homes and loved ones. It speaks to me of G.O. 100, with all its attendant horrors and cruelties and sufferings; of a country laid waste with fire and sword; of animals useful to man wantonly killed; of men, women and children hunted like wild beasts, and all of this in the name of Liberty, Humanity, and Civilization.

Publication history She first appeared in Mister Miracle vol. 1 #6 (February 1972) and was created by Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Co-leader of the Female Furies, Bernadeth wields a \\"fahren-knife\\" that burns her victims from the inside. As the sister of Darkseid's servant, Desaad, Bernadeth is both notorious and feared by the masses of Apokolips. She was one of the first Furies to be recruited, though Bernadeth hated being led by others. When Big Barda left for Earth to be with Mister Miracle, Bernadeth joined her alongside Lashina, Stompa, and Mad Harriet for a brief period of time.Mister Miracle #8-12 (1972-1973) Later, Bernadeth returned to Apokolips with the other Furies sans Barda.New Gods #6 (1984) Bernadeth saw Barda's permanent defecting as a way to gain leadership herself. However, Darkseid rewarded Lashina with leadership of the Furies. During a mission to retrieve Glorious Godfrey, Bernadeth betrayed Lashina and left her on Earth.Suicide Squad #3 (1987) Because of this, Bernadeth was temporarily able to achieve leadership over the Furies. When Lashina returned to Apokolips with the Suicide Squad, she snapped Bernadeth's neck after a long and fierce battle.Suicide Squad #34-36 (1989) Darkseid was appalled by the fact that Lashina brought outsiders to Apokolips, so he killed her and resurrected Bernadeth, although he later brought Lashina back to life as well.Mister Miracle #17-18 (1990) Afterwards, Bernadeth agreed to share leadership duties. Later on Apokolips, she was seen along with the rest of the Furies testing Granny Goodness' newest recruit Precious. After Supergirl's capture, Bernadeth and her teammates were defeated by Wonder Woman and Big Barda. She appeared in both the Seven Soldiers: Mister Miracle mini-series, and in Hawkgirl. During Countdown to Final Crisis, Bernadeth attempted and failed to stop Jimmy Olsen and Forager from escaping Apokolips. After they escaped, Bernadeth was confronted by the Infinity-Man, presumably resulting in her death.Countdown to Final Crisis #19 (2007) Bernadeth later appeared in as part of the \\"Dark Side Club\\". She created drugs that helped Granny Goodness brainwash superheroes into fighting at the Dark Side Club arena. She also experimented on cell samples from the club's victims, and thereby was the first to learn that Black Alice was related to Misfit.Birds of Prey #118 =The New 52= In The New 52, Darkseid is enslaved by his daughter Grail, leading Bernadeth and the other Female Furies to accept an offer from Big Barda to help defeat Grail as well as to protect Barda's husband, Mister Miracle. Bernadeth participated in the final battle against Grail and Darkseid, which resulted in the pair's defeat. Bernadeth then left for Apokolips with the rest of the Furies, including Barda.Justice League #50 (2016) =DC Rebirth= Although Bernadeth was not seen with the other Female Furies who sided with Granny Goodness during Lex Luthor's reign as lord of Apokolips,Superman #34-36 (2018) she reunited with her teammates as they discovered Darkseid was alive on Earth. Along with the other Furies, Bernadeth was assigned to seek out mystical artifacts that would empower Darkseid.Wonder Woman #39 (2018) However, Bernadeth and the Furies were unable to gather the artifacts after being ambushed by Steve Trevor and his Oddfellows and returned to Darkseid. Despite threatening them, Darkseid allowed the Furies to live as he decided he had further use for them.Wonder Woman #41 (2018) Bernadeth later joined in the battle against Wonder Woman and A.R.G.U.S. in the Amazon Jungle, though it resulted in Darkseid's destruction.Wonder Woman #45 (2018) At some point, Bernadeth attended the birth of Big Barda and Mister Miracle's son alongside the other Furies. She let Mister Miracle borrow her Fahren-Knife to \\"cut her as she needs to be cut\\". Big Barda assumed this to be a threat. However, when the child was born, it left Barda's womb strangled by her invulnerable umbilical cord. With no other options, Mister Miracle used the Fahren-Knife to cut her cord and save the baby's life. Afterwards, Mister Miracle returned the weapon to Bernadeth, thanking her. She replied that she was glad it helped, but that she would use it to kill him when they returned to war.Mister Miracle #7 (2018) Later, she joined Kalibak and Kanto in a meeting with Mister Miracle, Big Barda, and Lightray to discuss the options of a peace treaty between Apokolips and New Genesis.Mister Miracle #9 Granny Goodness soon took an interest in Harley Quinn, sending Bernadeth and Lashina to recruit the former criminal. While Lashina distracted Quinn, Bernadeth pricked her in the back with a knockout poison. The two then took Quinn to Apokolips where she officially became a Fury.Harley Quinn #45 (2018) After Quinn failed as a Fury, Bernadeth trapped her and a former Fury named Petite Tina inside her Personality Re-Education Center where she planned to wipe their minds.Harley Quinn #46 (2018) After many attempts, Bernadeth's machine was unable to do any permanent brain damage to Quinn. Frustrated, Bernadeth left the pair to find DeSaad's razor-edged Sanity Blade.Harley Quinn #47 (2018) Powers and abilities Bernadeth is extremely long-lived and possesses the standard superhuman strength, durability, and speed of all New Gods. She can lift several tons easily and her advanced physiology gives her superhuman endurance at all physical activities.The DC Comics Encyclopedia Bernadeth is very skilled in the hand-to-hand combat. Bernadeth's weapon of choice is the Fahren-Knife, a mystical dagger forged from Darkseid's skin that enables her to burn her victims from the inside out. Bernadeth's brother DeSaad gave her the knife as a present, and it is said to be powerful enough to kill gods. Other versions =Amalgam= In the Marvel/DC amalgam series Unlimited Access, Bernadeth does not merge with any other villains, but is seen battling the heroes alongside Mad Harriet.Unlimited Access #4 (1998) =Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman= Bernadeth appears in the story \\"Dig For Fire\\" in the anthology series Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman. After discovering that Wonder Woman had traveled to Apokolips to save two of her Amazon sisters, Lashina, Stompa and Mad Harriet tracked her down. The trio refused to speak peacefully to Wonder Woman, and in the ensuing battle, the heroine was shot in the neck by an explosive dart from Bernadeth and thrown into the fiery pits by Stompa. When the Furies reported back to Darkseid, he was displeased that they had killed her rather than executing her publicly. Wonder Woman, still alive, managed to save her sisters. The Furies once again battled Wonder Woman, though the battle ended when Darkseid killed the two Amazons and allowed Wonder Woman to return to Earth.Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman #16-18 (digital) In other media =Television= * Bernadeth appeared in Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Alive\\" voiced by Jennifer Hale.

It has the Bayer designation G Carinae, with HR 3643 being the star's designation in the Bright Star Catalogue. The system is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.48. It is located at a distance of approximately 401 light years from the Sun based on parallax, and is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +22.5 km/s. The binary nature of this system was first detected as an ultraviolet excess in 1996. No radial velocity variation has been detected so it must be a wide system with an orbital period of up to 21 years. The estimated semimajor axis of their orbit is . The pair were not resolved using the Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 instrument. The primary is an evolved bright giant star with a yellow-white hue and a stellar classification of F8II. With the supply of hydrogen exhausted at its core, it has expanded to 13 times the Sun's radius. It has a relatively high projected rotational velocity of 53 km/s for a star of this class, suggesting it is an intermediate-mass star with 2‚Äì5 times the mass of the Sun. The star is radiating 206 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,030 K. The magnitude 14.50 companion is a white dwarf with a class of DA1.6. It has a mass estimated at 74% of the mass of the Sun and a temperature of 21,551 K, indicating a cooling time of 25 million years. This object is a source for hard X-ray emission.

One of the primary goals of the archive is to democratize access to academic information on religion by making this information as widely accessible as possible. Over 900 surveys, membership reports, and other data collections are currently available for online preview, and most can be downloaded free of charge. Other features include national profiles, GIS maps, church membership overviews, denominational heritage trees, historical timelines, tables, charts, and other summary reports. Founded as the American Religion Data Archive in 1997, and online since 1998, the archive was initially targeted at researchers interested in American religion. In February 2006, the American Religion Data Archive became the Association of Religion Data Archives when an international data archive was added. The archive now includes both American and international collections as well as features for educators, journalists, religious congregations, and researchers. Data included in the ARDA are submitted by the foremost religion scholars and research centers in the world. Currently housed in the Social Science Research Institute at Pennsylvania State University, the ARDA is funded by Lilly Endowment, the John Templeton Foundation, Chapman University, and Pennsylvania State University. History Roger Finke, then professor of sociology at Purdue University, founded the American Religion Data Archive in 1996 on a grant from Lilly Endowment. Data file collection and processing began in 1997. The online archive launched in the fall of 1998 under the domain name www.thearda.com, and originally contained thirty-three surveys regarding American religion. Within ten years, the archive had expanded to include more than 400 data files. , more than 900 data files were available for download on the ARDA website. Starting in 2005, the ARDA began to host surveys dealing with religion outside the United States. In 2006, the archive therefore changed its name from the American Religion Data Archive to the Association of Religion Data Archives to more properly reflect the scope of information available. The new name preserved both the acronym and the domain name from the American Religion Data Archive. Since its founding, the ARDA has moved from Purdue to the Population Research Institute at Pennsylvania State University, where is still run under the direction of Roger Finke, with the assistance of Christopher Bader of Chapman University. The staff has, since 1997, expanded to include a research team of religion experts and graduate students, a marketing and web development team, a team of editors for guiding papers and working papers, a learning center editor, and a press room editor. Overview The primary component of the ARDA, the data archive, contains around 775 quantitative data files . ARDA staff do not themselves collect the data encompassed in these files; rather, the surveys' principal investigators submit their data to the ARDA for processing and archiving. Thus, the data files currently included in the archive originate from almost 200 different sources. Major data file contributors include the Presbyterian Panel Survey, the Southern Focus Poll, the U.S. Congregational Life Survey, and the Middletown Area Study. Data from the General Social Survey, the American National Election Studies, the World Religion Dataset, and the Pew Research Center are also available. Among the most common topics of information included are public opinions regarding social issues (e.g. abortion, homosexuality, the role of women), survey respondents' perceptions of God/the divine, and survey respondents' religious affiliations. In addition to archived survey data, the ARDA also provides information regarding the religious composition of, and the state of religious freedom in, the 232 nations currently recognized by the United States State Department; membership and distributional data and historical lineages (\\"Family Trees\\") of major world religions and U.S. denominations thereof; and various learning tools. A bi-weekly journalistic article dealing with matters of religion and (usually American) public life, written by David Briggs, also appears on the ARDA website. This article is cross-posted to the Huffington Post, for which Briggs also writes. In 2015, the ARDA began providing interactive historical timelines of religion in the United States. Currently, there are three interactive timelines listed: Prominent Religious Events and People, Baptist Events and People, and Catholic Events and People.

FAPE is a civil right rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires schools to provide students with disabilities special education and related services, at public expense, designed to prepare those students for the future. The right to FAPE was developed via various statutes as well as case law, and its implementation has evolved over the years.  Basics  FAPE is a civil right rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which includes the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses. FAPE is defined in 7 CFR ¬ß 15b.22 as \\"the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to meet individual needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii) are based on adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements\\" specified for one's educational setting with regard to one's evaluation, placement, and procedural safeguards. In the U.S. Code, FAPE is defined as an educational program and related services that are individualized to a specific student and meet the standards established by the state, provided at public expense and without charge. To provide FAPE to a student, schools must provide students with an education, including specialized instruction and related services where necessary, designed to prepare the child for \\"further education, employment, and independent living.\\" History =Underpinnings= Various laws began to carve out space for a student's right to FAPE in the mid-to-late twentieth century. For example, the 1958 Captioned Films Act, Public Law 85-905Public Law 85-905., was intended, at least in part, to enrich the educational experience of the deaf, demonstrating recognition that their educational opportunities differed somewhat from their hearing peers. Further, the Training of Professional Personnel Act of 1959, Public Law 86-158Public Law 86-158., increased the types and amount of training individuals received in learning how to educate students deemed \\"mentally retarded\\" (though the preferred term is now students with intellectual and developmental disabilities). In addition, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Public Law 89-10Public Law 89-10., as originally enacted in 1965 and amended that same year via Public Law 89-313Public Law 89-313., gave states grant assistance for educating students with disabilities. Case law in the lower federal courts, i.e., at the district court level, began to move in a similar direction. In the 1972 case Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children (PARC) v. Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaPARC v. Commonwealth of Pa., 343 F. Supp. 279 (E.D. Penn. 1972)., the court decided that a state could not deny, delay, or end any intellectually disabled student's access to a public education. The decision was reached after the Pennsylvania Board of Education, thirteen school districts, and the state's secretaries of education and public welfare sued the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The opinion asserted that education should be viewed as a continuous process, focused not only on academics, but also on teaching students how to manage their surroundings. Similarly, in Mills v. Board of Education of District of ColumbiaMills v. Bd. of Educ. of D.C., 348 F. Supp. 866 (D.D.C. 1972)., a case decided the same year, a group of students labeled \\"mentally retarded, emotionally disturbed or hyperactive\\" by D.C. public schools filed a civil action suit against them after being denied admission without due process under Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.Kloo, Amanda; Volonino, Victoria; Zigmond, Naomi (Oct-Dec 2009). \\"What, Where and How? Special Education in the Climate of Full Inclusion\\". Exceptionality 17 (4): 189-204. The court condemned the school's decision and declared that all children in D.C., regardless of any physical, mental, or emotional disabilities, are entitled to a free and appropriate public education. Yet these precursors of FAPE were just the beginning of the trend. =Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973= The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 established non-discrimination requirements for federal agencies and for state and local programs receiving federal assistance. The Act does not directly bar discrimination by individuals (as does the Americans with Disabilities Act, infra) but focuses its efforts on discrimination by the state and local recipients of federal assistance. Section 504 states that \\"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service.\\" As a result, state public education programs became subject to federal non-discrimination requirements. However, Section 504 only requires that the school in question develop a \\"plan\\" (often called a \\"504 Plan\\") for the child, unlike an Individualized Education Program, or IEP, which tends to generate a more in-depth, actionable document. IEPs can include specialized instruction and related services, whereas 504 Plans only offer accommodations. Generally, more students qualify for 504 Plans than IEPs, as the bar is lower and less specific. =Education for All Handicapped Children Act = In 1975 Congress passed Public Law 94-142Public Law 94-142., also known as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which outlined that public schools should provide all students with an education appropriate for their unique needs at public expense (i.e., FAPE). Public Law 94-142 also included that: *The rights of students and their parents are protected by the law, under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. *Students and their educational rights holders (almost always their families) are entitled to due process (including access to judicial review to determine that other parties have complied with their obligations) and notice. *Schools are required to find students with disabilities within their jurisdiction and refer those students for services (often called \\"child find\\" obligations). *Students are entitled to assessments to determine whether they have disabilities. *Students with disabilities must have Individualized Education Plans, or IEPs. *An IEP should be \\"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits,\\" e.g., achieving passing marks and grade advancement. *Parents have a right to participate in the creation of their student's IEP, including but not limited to being present at IEP meetings. * Students with disabilities should receive instruction in the \\"least restrictive environment\\" (LRE), ideally along with non-disabled peers where possible. * Congress funds up to 40% of excess costs of educating students with disabilities. Public Law 94-142 has been amended and reauthorized several times since 1975. In 1986, it was amended to Public Law 99-457.Public Law 99-457. The 1990 Amendment, Public Law 101-476Public Law 101-476., renamed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. = Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) = The 1997 amendments of Public Law 105-17Public Law 105-17. extended the LRE requirements to assure all students access to the general education curriculum and required that assistive technology devices and services be considered (though not necessarily included) for every IEP. The 2004 amendment, Public Law 108-446Public Law 108-446., focused on providing transition services for individuals with disabilities moving on from their school. The amendments articulate that transition services should look into connecting the students to appropriate employment opportunities and/or community resources. It also outlined that IEPs should have both short- and long-term goals and created legal framework for student discipline. Public Law 108-446 included information on teacher credentialing, i.e., so that they may be considered \\"highly qualified.\\" In providing FAPE, Public Law 108-446 also clarified that states also need to set targets for their students to meet and failure to do so brings federal sanctions, such as loss of funds. = Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) = Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by state and local governmental entities, including public school districts. Title III of the ADA also prohibits discrimination against students with disabilities in private schools that are considered public accommodations. While private schools are not required to provide FAPE to students with disabilities (as by definition a private school does not provide a public education), under the ADA they must take reasonable steps to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their private educational program. Many times this means changes to school rules, such as letting a student to carry a cell phone, permitting the use of tape recorders or laptop computers in class, or allowing a student extra time to walk between classrooms. A school might also provide auxiliary aids and services such as computer-aided transcription services, assistive listening devices for auditorium-based lectures, closed captioned decoders, open and closed captioning, TDDs, and videotext displays. A private school is not required to provide an accommodation if the school can show that providing the service would fundamentally alter their program or require significant difficulty or expense, and under some circumstances they may charge extra for additional services. For example, if a school offers after-school tutoring to all students for an additional fee, they may charge the same fees to a student with a disability desiring after-school tutoring. = Supreme Court decisions= In Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley\\"Board of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (1982)\\". Justia Law. Retrieved 2020-05-30., the Supreme Court ruled that a free and appropriate public education should provide access to specialized instruction. The Court ruled, however, that the school was not obliged to provide an interpreter for a deaf student to meet the bar of FAPE. If the child is passing on to the next grade within an inclusion classroom, then FAPE is presumed to be met. In other words, the state does not need to \\"maximize each child's potential.\\" This left families, advocates, and schools alike wondering: How far do the parameters of FAPE extend? The United States Supreme Court eventually unanimously ruled on the rights of students with disabilities to FAPE in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District.Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District, 580 U.S. ___ (2017). The Court held that the IDEA provides disabled students the right to more than just token progress from one year to the following year.\\"Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): What You Need to Know\\". Understood.org. Retrieved 2018-07-23. The \\"merely more than de minimis\\" standard was rejected. The Court held that all students should have a chance to meet challenging objectives. In light of the student's circumstances, schools must offer individualized educational programming that enable \\"appropriate progress.\\" = Department of Education policy = The Department of Education came out with a question and answer document of nine pages addressing the high court‚Äôs ruling in Endrew.Questions and Answers (Q&A;) on U. S. Supreme Court Case Decision Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District Re-1. Officials offered their thoughts on how teachers, school officials, parents, and stakeholders must apply this verdict in actual scenarios. For example, according to the education department, IEPs must improve functional as well as educational performance and be reassessed if the child does not make progress in accordance with the yearly objectives. Implementation In Board of Education v. Rowley the United States Supreme Court set forth a two- part inquiry for determining whether a school district has satisfied the FAPE requirement, having to do with 1) procedure and 2) educational benefit. = Procedural requirements = First, the state must have \\"complied with the procedures set forth in the Act.\\" These procedures enable parents of a disabled child to examine school records, participate in meetings, and present complaints. Parents must also be given notice of any proposals to change the educational placement of a child, and they are entitled to an independent educational evaluation (IEE). They can initiate an impartial due process hearing for failure to comply with the Act and bring a subsequent civil action challenging an adverse determination at the hearing. Note, however, that harmless procedural errors do not amount to a denial of FAPE.L. M. v. Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist., 556 F.3d 900, 910 (9th Cir. 2008). Nonetheless, \\"procedural inadequacies that result in the loss of educational opportunity, or seriously infringe the parents' opportunity to participate in the IEP formulation process, clearly result in the denial of FAPE.\\"Shapiro v. Paradise Valley Unified Sch. Dist., 317 F.3d 1072, 1079 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting W.G. v. Bd. of Trs. of Target Range Sch. Dist. No. 23, 960 F.2d 1479, 1484 (9th Cir. 1992)). = Educational benefit = Second, the IEP that is developed must be \\"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\\"\\"Board of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206-207 (1982)\\". Justia Law. Retrieved 2020-05-30. However, the IDEA guarantees only a basic floor of opportunity, consisting of specialized instruction and related services that provide educational benefit to individual students.Adam J. ex rel.

Florida Union Free Sch. Dist., 142 F.3d 119 (2d Cir. 1998)., nor one that maximizes the child's educational potential. Rather, it need only be an education that specifically meets a child's unique needs, supported by services that permit the child to benefit from the instruction. Rowley said the IDEA \\"cannot be read as imposing any particular substantive educational standard upon the States.\\" However, \\"merely more than de minimis\\" standard was rejected in Endrew, which decided that all students should have a chance to meet challenging objectives. In light of the student's circumstances, schools must offer individualized educational programming that enable \\"appropriate progress.\\" One clear benchmark is progress grade-to-grade, which some courts requireP. ex rel.

This type of performance comes in many varieties, including autobiographical creations, comedy acts, novel adaptations, vaudeville, poetry, music and dance. In 1996, Rob Becker's Defending the Caveman became the longest running solo (one man) play in the history of Broadway.  Traits of solo performance  Solo performance is used to encompass the broad term of a single person performing for an audience. Some key traits of solo performance can include the lack of the fourth wall and audience participation or involvement. Solo performance does not need to be written, performed and produced by a single person a solo performance production may utilize directors, writers, designers and composers to bring the piece to life on a stage. An example of this collaboration is Eric Bogosian in the published version of his show Wake Up And Smell the Coffee, by Theatre Communications Group, New York City.Bonney, Jo. Extreme Exposure: an Anthology of Solo Performance Texts from the Twentieth Century. Theatre Communications Group, 2008. History It is assumed that individuals have told stories in front of other members of their tribe or society for thousands of years. They would have orally passed down many of today's myths and legends in this manner. So it is a style of performance that has been with us for generations developing through theatrical people such as Greek Monologists, the strolling Minstrels of Medieval England and the French Troubadors. Edgar Allan Poe both lectured and recited poetry as a platform performer between 1843 and 1849; his performances stand as a paradigm of the solo performance hybrid simply called \\"the lecture-recital\\". The reading tours of Charles Dickens in Britain and America between 1858 and 1870 created a sensation. His American tour of 1867‚Äì68 was unparalleled until the arrival of the Beatles in the early 1960s. Solo performance enjoyed an unprecedented artistic and commercial vogue in the United States during the second half of the nineteenth century (John S. Gentile Calls it the golden age of platform performance). Literary historians often associate the Victorian period with the highest development of the dramatic monologue as a poetic form. There were several discussions about the importance and distinction between the literary monologue and the performance monologue during the nineteenth century, however, this discussions confirms a continuous interchange between literature and performance, which may at times appear competitive but is more often productive. By the time the United States entered the 20th century, the number and variety of professional solo performances presented throughout the country had grown large.Gentile, pages 61‚Äì64. This renaissance of solo performance also created ripples in the larger sense of American theatre; after this \\"boom\\" of the one man show had passed, the presentational style seeped into popular theatre productions such as Amadeus, Equus, and Evita among others, modeling a combination of representational theatricality and presentational, direct-address style.Gentile, pages 194‚Äì195. By the 1960s, the term performance art became popular and involved any number of performance acts or happenings, as they were known. Many performers, like Laurie Anderson, developed through these happenings and are still performing today.  Types and examples of solo performances  The backgrounds of solo performers over the decades range from vaudeville, comedy, poetry, music, the visual arts, magic, cabaret, theatre and dance. Solo performers include Rob Becker, Lily Tomlin, Andy Kaufman, Rod Maxwell, Lord Buckley, Eric Bogosian, Whoopi Goldberg, Jade Esteban Estrada, Eddie Izzard, John Leguizamo, Marga Gomez, Anna Deavere Smith, Bill Hicks, Brother Blue and Lenny Bruce. Several performers have presented solo shows in tribute to famous personalities. The blueprint for this type of show may have been drafted by Hal Holbrook, who has performed as Mark Twain in his solo show, Mark Twain Tonight, more than 2,000 times since 1954. Examples since that time include Julie Harris in the Emily Dickinson biography, The Belle of Amherst; Tovah Feldshuh as Golda Meir in Golda's Balcony; Frank Gorshin as George Burns in Say Goodnight GracieIbdb.com by Rupert Holmes; Ed Metzger in his solo show, performing since 1978, Albert Einstein: The Practical Bohemian; Metzger in another solo performance, Hemingway: On the Edge; Henry Fonda as Clarence Darrow in Darrow, Ronald Rand as Harold Clurman in Let It Be Art! since 2001 in 25 countries, and Tom Dugan as Simon Wiesenthal in Wiesenthal. A few actors adapted entire novels for the stage including Patrick Stewart who played all 43 parts in his version of A Christmas Carol, which played three times on Broadway and at The Old Vic in London; actor Gerald Charles Dickens played 26 characters in his performances from the same work; and Jack Aranson starred in a solo, 13-character production of Moby Dick. Solo performance may be personal, autobiographical creations. This ranges from the intensely confessional but comedic work of Spalding Gray, the semi-autobiographical A Bronx Tale by Chaz Palminteri, or Holly Hughes' solo piece World without End, in which she attempts to make sense of her relationship with her mother, who had died. Another example of this is In The Body of the World, written and performed by Eve Ensler in 2018. Still other shows may rally around a central theme, such as pop culture in Pat Hazel's The Wonderbread Years, relationships in Robert Dubac's The Male Intellect, the history of the New York City transit system in Mike Daisey's Invincible Summer, or fighting the system in Patrick Combs' Man 1, Bank 0. these themes could also be centered around a certain topic such as a political or social issue. Tim Miller explores the topic of gay culture and society surrounding the LGBTQ community in his production of My Queer Body. Karen Finley expressed her frustration with the standards women are held to and the issues surrounding them such as rape and abortion in her solo piece titled We Keep Our Victims Ready.Neely, Kent. \\"Theatre Journal.\\" Theatre Journal, vol. 42, no. 4, 1990, pp. 495‚Äì497. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3207728. Sometimes, solo shows are simply traditional plays written by playwrights for a cast of one. Examples: Shirley Valentine by Willy Russell, I Am My Own Wife by Doug Wright, The Blonde, the Brunette and the Vengeful Redhead by Robert Hewett and Topless by Miles Tredinnick. A performer of shows of this type is Chris Harris, whose performances in the genre include Kemp's Jig, That's The Way To Do It!, Ally Sloper's Half Holiday, Beemaster, 'Arris Music 'All and A Night at the Pantomime. There have also been many British comedians who have moved away from performing pure stand-up comedy in recent years. The shows that appear annually at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe can involve stories of pathos and the use of technological equipment such as projectors. Examples include Howard Read, who has performed with the animated character Little Howard which was projected with the aid of computers and Dave Gorman, who has performed several shows described as \\"documentary comedy\\". Solo performance in film The first full-length talking film which showed only a single character was Sofi, a 1968 film starring Tom Troupe. The film was based on \\"Diary of a Madman\\" by Gogol. The 1964 Hindi movie Yaadein also featured only Sunil Dutt, but Nargis Dutt made a few appearances as a silhouette. However, it still made it to the Guinness Book of World Records for the \\"fewest actors in a narrative film\\".https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current- affairs/story/sunil-dutt-s-yaadein-a-one-man-act-film-is-in-the-guinness-book- of-world-records-1251834-2018-06-06 In the 21st century the \\"solo performance\\" had a rejuvenation period. with films like Locke, All Is Lost and Buried. The characteristics were different from the previous one-character films that were made ‚Äì mainly by location and style. Sofi and works like Give 'em Hell, Harry!, were still studio-filmed theater pieces. The 21st-century films were mostly shot on location and were much more stylized with their cinematic expression and camera usage. Most recently films by Marcus Tell showed ongoing characteristics of one-character films.

The egg was made to commemorate Tsarina, Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna. It was frequently on exhibition at The Hermitage Museum (specifically the Winter Palace) in St. Petersburg, Russia, and also materialized in various museums worldwide, placed in temporary exhibits there. It is currently owned by one of the Russian oligarchs, Viktor Vekselberg. Design The piece with its original stand in 1902, now lost. The egg is made from gold with translucent lime yellow enamel on a guilloch√© field of starbursts and is in reference to the cloth-of-gold robe worn by the Tsarina at her Coronation. It is trellised with bands of greenish gold laurel leaves mounted at each intersection by a gold Imperial double-headed eagle enamelled opaque black, and set with a rose diamond on its chest. This pattern was also drawn from the Coronation robe worn by the Empress. Imperial Monogram of Empress Alexandra Feodorovna A large portrait diamond is set in the top of the egg within a cluster of ten brilliant diamonds; through the table of this stone, the monogram of the Empress can be seen. At the other, more narrow end, a smaller portrait diamond is set within a cluster of rose diamonds surrounded by a flower motif made of 20 narrow gold petals. At this end of the egg the portrait diamond covers the date 1897 inscribed on a plaque similar to that of the monogram. The egg was presented together with a glass-enclosed jadeite stand for the display of the carriage at a cost of 5650 rubles. Surprise Fitted inside a velvet-lined compartment is a precise replica, less than four inches long, of the 18th-century Imperial coach that carried the Tsarina Alexandra to her coronation at Moscow's Uspensky Cathedral. The red colour of the original coach was recreated using strawberry coloured translucent enamel and the blue upholstery of the interior was also reproduced in enamels. The coach is surmounted by the Imperial Crown in rose diamonds and six double- headed eagles on the roof; it is fitted with engraved rock crystal windows and platinum tyres decorated with a diamond-set trellis in gold and an Imperial eagle in diamonds at either door. The miniature is complete with moving wheels, opening doors, actual C-spring shock absorbers and a tiny folding step-stair. Missing surprises include an emerald or diamond pendant that hung inside the replica coach, a glass-enclosed jadeite stand for the display of the carriage as well as a stand made of silver-gilt wire. History The last Romanov patriarchs at their Coronation Mass, painting by Laurits Regner Tuxen, 1898 The coronation of Tsar Nicholas II and his spouse, Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna was the catalyst for the Imperial Coronation Egg's creation, to celebrate the historical event. The coronation on May 14, 1896, was a day of jubilance and pride in the Romanovs, celebrated by throngs of spectators. The Russian nobility and guests gathered on the Eastern Orthodox day of Dormition, the death of Mary, inside Uspensky Cathedral for the actual coronation. The throne of the Czar, the former throne of Michael I of Russia was inset with 870 diamonds, rubies, and pearls. The throne of the Tsarina, the famous ivory throne of Ivan the Great, also was inset with a vast collection of jewels and rare gemstones. The gold miniature coach, which is removable from the interior of the Coronation Egg, is a replica of Catherine the Great's Gold Coach of 1793 used to transport the last Romanov rulers from ceremony to ceremony on the coronation week.

The egg was displayed in the Empress' apartment at the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, resting in a jewelled carriage. Upon the fall of the Romanov Dynasty, the egg was confiscated by the Provisional Government in 1917 and was listed among the treasures removed from the Anichkov Palace. It was then dispatched to the Kremlin and finally transferred to the Sovnarkom in 1922 for sale. =Further transactions= The egg was purchased in 1927 by Emanuel Snowman for Wartski a family-owned firm of art and antique dealers in London. The egg was then sold to the collector Charles Parsons in 1934, but then reacquired by Wartski in 1945 and remained with the company until early 1979. =Late twentieth century= In March 1979, the egg was sold to Malcolm Forbes for $2.16 Million USD along with the Lilies of the Valley Faberg√© Egg.

In addition to its main campus, the college operates 34 \\"extended campuses\\" in 13 U.S. states and 1 in Cuba,http://www.ccis.edu/nationwide/local-centers.aspx \\"Local centers\\".

History =1850s= Christian Female College received its charter from the Missouri Legislature on January 18, 1851, making it the first women's college west of the Mississippi River to be chartered by a state legislature. The city of Columbia strongly supported female education, in part because the University of Missouri did not yet admit women. Columbia was also home to Stephens College, founded in 1833 and chartered in 1856. Infrastructure was a problem; the first classes were held in an unfinished mansion. A typical day for female students in 1851 started at 6 a.m. with a morning walk, followed by worship in the chapel. They attended classes until late afternoon and then wrote a daily composition. After they studied and did chores, the students attended a Bible lecture every evening. They studied arithmetic, ancient history, grammar, ancient geography, philosophy, the five books of Moses, and composition.Columbia College: 150 Years of Courage, Commitment and Change\\" by Paulina \\"Polly\\" Batterson The College purchased the estate of Dr. James Bennett and formally dedicated the buildings and grounds as the Christian College campus in 1852. By 1856, there were 150 students, including 85 boarders. =1860s= In the chaos of the Civil War, Christian College President Joseph K. Rogers vowed to keep the school open. The majority of the city of Columbia was pro-Union but the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-slavery. Rogers was successful, thanks in part to faculty who relinquished pay. President Rogers insisted the college remain neutral and did not allow newspapers on the grounds, but privately he read them. As the fighting continued, so did the fight for the college's survival. Only three students graduated in 1862 and four the following year. But Christian College never missed a day of classes. After the war, Christian College saw its largest enrollment to date with 182 students taught by nine faculty members. =1890s‚Äì1920s= Growth continued through the start of the 20th century, especially under Luella St. Clair, a \\"steam engine in petticoats.\\" St. Clair served three different terms as president of the college between 1893 and 1920 and was one of the first female college presidents in the country.

She doubled the size of the faculty, held the first Ivy Chain ceremony, launched a college magazine, created a college orchestra, started a women's basketball team and implemented the then-innovative cap-and-gown uniform, which students wore in public. She also changed the college from a four-year school to one of the first accredited junior colleges in the country. =1960s‚Äìpresent= In 1970 the college changed from a four-year conservative all-female college to a liberal coeducational college, and changed its name to Columbia College. Between 1970 and 1971, more than 70 courses as daring as cycling and flying were added to the curriculum; all graduation requirements except freshman English and a GPA of 2.5 were dropped; more foreign students were admitted; and a host of lifestyle choices such as off-campus living for juniors, a relaxed dress code, and smoking were allowed. President W. Merle Hill said in 1971 that the time had come to openly allow discussions of poverty, the Vietnam War, racism, sex, drugs and abortion. All this was a radical departure from the college's conservative heritage and alienated some students and alumni. President W. Merle Hill said in 1971, ‚ÄúI would like to bring education screaming and kicking into the 1970s. Then we would only be about 70 years behind ... Instead of pounding something into students‚Äô heads, you have to permit young people to create their own lifestyle. If you dictate, they will rebel. The best way to teach is to let your own lifestyle be such that they want to follow, not rebel.‚Äù In bold contrast to the anti-military stance of many colleges, the college began educating military personnel in St. Louis at the request of the military, making it one of the first colleges in the country with extended campuses on military bases. This was the start of the Extended Studies Division first headed up by Dr. William Brown, who would later go on to serve as Executive Vice President of the college. Two years later, the college launched the Evening Campus, geared to adult learners. Today, the college has 33 extended campuses around the country serving more than 25,000 military and civilian students each year, including one in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In 1995, Columbia College offered its first graduate degree with a Master of Arts in Teaching, followed by a Master of Business Administration and a Master of Science in Criminal Justice. These degrees are offered through evening classes in Columbia, Mo., and at select extended campuses around the country. In 2000, the college launched its Online Campus, which now offers more than 500 online courses and 18 online degrees. The Columbia College Cougars women's volleyball program captured two consecutive National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) championships in 1998 and 1999 with perfect 45-0 and 44-0 records, respectively. And in honor of what would have been alumna Jane Froman‚Äôs 100th birthday, a centennial celebration was held at Columbia College November 9‚Äì11, 2007. A DVD of the movie, \\"With a Song in my Heart,\\" with added new segments, also premiered. Academics The college's academic divisions include:Columbia College Academic Catalogs *Visual Arts and Music Department *Business Administration Department *Computer and Mathematical Sciences Department *Criminal Justice and Human Services Department *Division of Adult Higher Education *Education Department *Evening Campus Office *Graduate Studies *History and Political Science Department *Humanities Department *International Programs *Nursing Program *Psychology and Sociology Department *Science Department =Rankings= In 2009, Columbia College was ranked 51st in the category of \\"Best Universities-Master's\\" for the Midwest Region by U.S. News & World Report. Also in 2014, Columbia College was named a \\"Best Midwestern College\\" by The Princeton Review, a New York City-based education services company; the college is one of 159 schools in a 12-state region to receive the designation, which are selected based on academics and surveys of current students. GetEducated.com named Columbia College a \\"Best Buy\\" for affordability and quality in several online degree categories: MBA, bachelor's in business administration, bachelor's in criminal justice, and bachelor's in human services. Athletics Columbia College's athletic teams are known as the Cougars. The teams compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) as a member of the American Midwest Conference.Columbia Cougars Men's sports include CC Men's lacrosse, baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, and track & field, while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track & field, bowling, and volleyball. =Women's basketball= Columbia College reinstated women's basketball as a varsity sport in 2000 and the team played its first game on Nov. 6, 2001 vs. Wesleyan University. In 2008, the Lady Cougars advanced to the AMC title game, falling to McKendree University (Ill.), 78-66. Sophomore forward Rachel Oswald was named Newcomer of the Year. The Lady Cougars are coached by Taylor Possail. =Men's basketball= Bob Burchard has led the Cougar basketball program for the last 25 years. A perennial powerhouse in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), the Cougars were 35-1 in the 2012-13 season. Columbia spent eight consecutive weeks ranked #1 in the nation and advanced to the quarterfinals of the NAIA tournament as the overall #1 seed. The 2012-13 NABC National Coach of the Year has compiled a 632-226 (.737) record at Columbia giving him the most in wins in program history. The Cougars have averaged 25 victories per season under his guidance. This transition took many by surprise because the 14 seasons prior to Burchard's arrival, the Cougars recorded a 98-224 (.304) record. The Cougars have advanced to the NAIA Men's National Basketball Championship 17 times in his tenure, including 16 of the past 19 seasons. In the 2008-09 season Columbia advanced to the NAIA National Championship game. Burchard has been named conference Coach of the Year eight times, most recently 2012-13 when the Cougars swept the American Midwest Conference with a 16-0 record. Among all active coaches in the NAIA Division I, Burchard stands at fifth in most wins with 632 and 3rd highest winning percentage (.737). =Men's soccer= Men's Cougar soccer has also seen some successes; in 2006, the soccer team finished second in the conference with an overall record of 11-7-1. The soccer team is coached by John Klein. =Softball= The softball program won three straight AMC Tournament Championships from 2001 to 2004 and won again in 2008. Head coach Wendy Spratt has achieved 500 victories with a win over Northwestern Oklahoma State University in April 2007. The AMC named pitcher Valerie Teter the league's most valuable player and freshman of the year in 2008. Teter threw a two-hitter and stuck out 10 in five innings, adding a grand slam in the second inning. AMC's Pitcher of the Year award went to Katie McMahon for the second straight season in 2008 following a 16-4 record with a 1.61 ERA, and 138 strikeouts in 135 innings. McMahon is the eighth Columbia College player since 1999 to earn the league's top pitching honor; other two-time winners from Columbia College were Jayne Miller and Monica Mueller. =Women's volleyball= The women's volleyball program has been successful in NAIA Division I, with three perfect seasons and championships in 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2015. In the late 1990s, the husband-and-wife team of Wayne and Coach Susan Kreklow drove the team to the NAIA National Tournament six times and won five regional championships and seven consecutive American Midwest Conference championships. In 1998 and 1999, Columbia College achieved consecutive undefeated seasons with a combined record of 85-0. The Cougars' undefeated record included 78 consecutive wins at home and 227 consecutive game victories. In 1997 and 1998, the Kreklows shared NAIA/AVCA National Coach of the Year and Midwest Region Coach of the Year honors. In 1999, the coaching tandem took home the regional award for the fifth consecutive year. In 1998 and 1999, the Kreklows also received the NAIA National Tournament Coach of the Year award. After the 1999 season, both Kreklows left the Cougars, but did not go far - just two miles down the city's College Avenue, where Wayne took the head coaching job with the Missouri Tigers and Susan became Director of Volleyball for Mizzou. The Kreklows also started the men's volleyball program at Columbia College in 1997. In 1999, the Cougars finished the season with a 19-5 overall record, enjoying their second consecutive undefeated run through the Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. They also took second place at the inaugural SSI Volleyball National Invitational Tournament in 1999. In 2000 the Men's Team won the NAIA championship; although the Kreklows were not there for the entire season, they are the coaches who put the team together and coached them for the first part of the year. The men's volleyball program has since been disbanded. In 2000, with a team composed of ten freshmen and three sophomores, the Lady Cougars finished 44-2 for a second- place finish at the NAIA National Tournament. Coach Melinda Wrye-Washington was named American Midwest Conference and NAIA Region V Coach of the Year. In 2001, the Lady Cougars returned to perfect form as NAIA champions with a 38-0 record. In 2015, the squad finished with a record of 33-7 winning the AMC Conference Tournament championship and NAIA National Tournament. Outside hitter Penny Liu was named the NAIA Player of the Year and First Team All- American. Sashiko Heredia was names Second Team All-American while head coach Melinda Wrye-Washington was named the NAIA Volleyball Coach of the Year.

Vogler (April 24, 1913 ‚Äì c. May 31, 1993) was the founder of the Alaskan Independence Party. He was also chair or gubernatorial nominee during most of the company's existence. He was also known, originally in his adopted hometown of Fairbanks, Alaska, and later statewide, as a frequent participant in governmental and political affairs and frequent litigant in court. Curiously enough, he was known to many non-political observers for his fashion sense, in particular his ubiquitous wearing of fedoras and bolo ties. Early life Vogler was born April 24, 1913, on a farm outside Barnes, Kansas. He graduated from high school in Waterville, Kansas, in 1929. That year, he began studying at the University of Kansas on a scholarship. He graduated with a law degree in five years and was admitted to the Kansas State Bar. Vogler moved to Alaska in March 1942, having run afoul of many of his contemporaries in the Lower 48 regarding his views on then-U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. After spending a year in Kodiak, he moved to Fairbanks and worked as a civilian employee of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Ladd Field (now Fort Wainwright) in Fairbanks, until 1951 when he began mining on Homestake Creek. He filed for of homestead land off the Steese Highway and acquired near Fairbanks off Farmers Loop Road. Vogler spent fifty years as a miner and developer in Alaska. Vogler was known around Fairbanks as a frequent writer of letters to the editor until 1973 when he launched a petition drive calling for Alaska to secede. He subsequently launched his first campaign for governor a year later. He gained his first serious notoriety in Fairbanks during the 1940s and 1950s for a feud with Paul and Flora Greimann, operators of University Bus Lines. The company was a private urban transit company, which primarily transported students between Fairbanks and the University of Alaska. Prior to the replacement of the Cushman Street Bridge in 1959, the old bridge was too narrow to accommodate both a large vehicle such as a truck or bus, and another vehicle. Vogler, with Warren A. Taylor as his attorney, sued University Bus Lines in 1948 in what the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner at the time called the \\"Battle of the Bridge\\". Vogler sought a permanent injunction against the buses straddling the center rail of the bridge. The feud continued after the Wendell Street Bridge opened in 1953 and Greimann's buses continued using the Cushman bridge instead of the newer, wider bridge. Police were often involved in quelling these confrontations. Political career Vogler arose as a figure in Alaskan politics in 1973, where he began a petition calling for secession of Alaska from the United States. Alaska magazine reported that Vogler claimed to have gathered 15,000 signatures over a period of about three weeks. Vogler was quoted as saying about the effort: \\"The response has been beyond my wildest expectations. I never dreamed the people would respond like this.\\" During the 1970s, Vogler founded the Alaskan Independence Party (AIP) and Alaskans For Independence. The latter name was originally used to label the 1973 petition drive. Vogler also claimed to have organized the meeting which led to the formation of the Alaska Libertarian Party. The AIP and AFI, as Vogler explained, were intended to function as strictly separate entities‚ÄîAIP was primarily to explore whether the 1958 vote by Alaskans authorizing statehood was legal, and AFI was primarily to actively pursue secession for Alaska from the United States. The Alaskan Independence Party quotes Vogler as stating \\"I'm an Alaskan, not an American. I've got no use for America or her damned institutions.\\" In a 1991 interview currently housed at the Oral History Program in the Rasmuson Library at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Vogler is recorded as saying \\"The fires of hell are frozen glaciers compared to my hatred for the American government. And I won't be buried under their damn flag. I'll be buried in Dawson. And when Alaska is an independent nation they can bring my bones home.\\" Vogler would serve as the AIP's standard-bearer for most of the party's first two decades. He ran for governor in 1974, with Wayne Peppler (born March 26, 1942), a fellow miner from Fairbanks, as his running mate. Jay Hammond, a longtime legislator from the Bristol Bay region, was elected over incumbent governor Bill Egan by 287 votes, with Vogler trailing far behind. Many commentators described Vogler as a \\"spoiler\\" in the election, arguing that the result would have been different had he not been in the race. However, this campaign opened up the doors for non-major party candidates to run for major offices in Alaska, and generally this accusation is leveled during every election cycle. Vogler switched to run for lieutenant governor in 1978, with Don Wright running for governor. Wright was also the AIP's nominee for governor from 2002 through 2010. The 1978 campaign for governor was dominated by the extremely controversial Republican primary race between moderate Hammond and former governor Walter Hickel. Hickel lost the primary by 98 votes and would launch a write-in campaign in the general election. Hammond was reelected governor. There was also a well- financed independent candidate in the race, Tom Kelly, who was Commissioner of Natural Resources under Hickel and his successor, Keith Miller. There was little hope for the AIP ticket to gain much attention due to these factors. The Democratic nominee, Chancy Croft, placed third in the general election due to the continued interest in Hammond vs. Hickel beyond the primary election. Vogler also ran for governor in 1982 and 1986. Several incidents during these campaigns raised his profile as a \\"colorful character.\\" In the 1982 race, Vogler was taken to task for comments made during a debate. The issue of moving Alaska's capital appeared during the election, as it has on and off since 1960. The media and political pundits took great fun over Vogler's debate remarks that Alaska should \\"nuke the glaciers\\" along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska and build a freeway to Juneau. Vogler would later contend that these comments were misinterpreted. Vogler's running mate in 1982 was Roger \\"Dee\\" Roberts (born March 27, 1937). Roberts had previously been a candidate for state Senate in 1974 under the banner of the American Independent Party. His family have continued as political activists in Fairbanks to this day. Vogler's running mate in 1986 was Al Rowe (born May 11, 1932), a Fairbanks resident and former Alaska State Trooper. Rowe took out a series of newspaper ads, fashioning himself in the image of Sheriff Buford Pusser. These ads were a major attention getter during the race. Between Rowe's ads and the turmoil existing in the Republican Party over the nomination of Arliss Sturgulewski, the AIP ticket was able to garner 5.5 percent of the vote, gaining the AIP status in Alaska as a recognized political party for the first time. Vogler quit running for public office after the 1986 election. However, he would play a significant role in the next gubernatorial race. In 1990, as party chair, Vogler paved the way for the vacation of the nominated party ticket of John Lindauer and Jerry Ward and their replacement with Hickel and Jack Coghill. Coghill had been nominated as the lieutenant governor candidate by the Republican Party, but was dealing with serious compatibility and philosophical issues with gubernatorial nominee Sturgulewski. The ticket of Hickel and Coghill would go on to win the election. Disappearance and death Vogler disappeared under suspicious circumstances on May 30, 1993,\\"Remains of Alaska Separatist Are Identified, The New York Times, published October 15, 1994 just weeks before he was scheduled to give a speech to the United Nations on Alaskan independence, sponsored by the government of Iran. Convicted thief Manfried West confessed to having murdered Vogler the following year in what he described as an illegal plastic explosive sale gone bad. West, trying to recant, later said the confession was a lie, but this was before Vogler's body had been discovered.Hugh Dellios Trail Grows Cold For Joe Vogler: Missing, No Body Found, seattletimes.nwsource.com, September 25, 1994. Vogler's remains were discovered in a gravel pit east of Fairbanks in October 1994 following an anonymous tip. He had been wrapped in a blue tarp secured with duct tape and was identified through fingerprint analysis. Manfried West was convicted of murdering Joe Vogler and sentenced to 80 years. In the opinion of AIP Chair Lynette Clark and other AIP leaders, however, Vogler's death reflected more than a dispute with West. Clark has stated, \\"He was executed.\\" She notes that Vogler was about to appear before the United Nations to address the issue of Alaskan independence: \\"The United States government would have been deeply embarrassed. And we can't have that, can we?\\" As he had publicly promised on numerous occasions, Vogler was buried in Dawson City, Yukon, Canada, fulfilling his wish that he not be buried under the American flag. His second wife, Doris Louise, who died of cancer in 1992, is buried next to him. Legacy Having graduated from law school, although never formally practicing law, Vogler nonetheless engaged in actions through the courts for most of his years in Fairbanks. These ranged from his dispute with Paul Griemann, through battling the Fairbanks North Star Borough over a great many issues in its earlier years, particularly regarding subdivisions he developed, to attempting to enforce subdivision covenants, to launching the earliest salvo in the fight for ballot access for minor parties in Alaska, through to his efforts regarding seeking formal recognition of his case on statehood issues. Vogler had launched many political and secessionist efforts behind the scenes in addition to his more high-profile runs for office. Perhaps the best known of these was the lawsuit Vogler v. Miller in 1982, a ballot access case. Vogler v. Miller would be heavily cited in succeeding ballot access cases later in the decade, such as Sykes v. Alaska, which more directly widened ballot access and party recognition beyond the two major parties. Vogler was noted for an antipathy toward aspens, to the point where he installed covenants in his subdivisions requiring homeowners to cut and destroy all poplar, cottonwood and aspen trees on a regular basis. This particular requirement would be challenged in court, with Vogler losing after a lengthy battle through the judicial system. The term \\"Voglerizer\\" has entered into the informal vernacular around the Fairbanks area to describe brush trimmers used on highway rights-of-way. Interest in Vogler was briefly reignited during a period in the late 2000s (decade), when intense media scrutiny of Sarah Palin during her governorship and vice-presidential candidacy turned up a Palin family connection to the AIP. Other events of note happened during the same time period, though mostly particular to Fairbanks. Fairbanks-based singer- songwriter Caleb Aronson released his debut album, Livengood, in March 2006. The first track on Disc 2, \\"Moving Dirt,\\" is a story song about Vogler's life and death. On July 7, 2006, Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya Know? broadcast live from the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus. Vogler's name was brought up during the broadcast, the mention eliciting a significant cheer from the audience. Also in 2006, the AIP released a compact disc entitled Joe Was Right! Volume 1. The disc consists of an interview given on KFAR's long- running Problem Corner talk show on October 18, 1982, during his second campaign for governor. Personal life Vogler had a daughter (Marilyn, born at St. Joseph's Hospital on April 6, 1945) and son (Joseph Jr., born c. 1947) by his first wife, but by all accounts (including his own), he had become estranged from this part of his family. Vogler met his second wife, Doris, in 1964 and remained with her until her death from cancer in 1992. Lynn Vogler, his nephew, was named the executor of his estate in a will he wrote following the death of Doris.

Publication history Mad Harriet first appeared in Mister Miracle vol. 1 #6 (January 1972) and was created by Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Mad Harriet is raised in Granny Goodness's orphanage. A deeply disturbed child, she impresses Granny with her ferocious temper and penchant for violence, and she inducts the girl into the Female Furies. In this capacity, Mad Harriet serves Darkseid. During the battle with the Earth-based Suicide Squad over the fate of Glorious Godfrey, Harriet is almost killed when she attacks the Bronze Tiger and her energy claws backfire. During another mission, Harriet is captured by the Gods of New Genesis but is sent back to Darkseid. Later, Mad Harriet is seen as a prostitute in Granny Goodness' brothel, though it is left ambiguous as to whether this is the real Mad Harriet or a delusion by the second Mister Miracle. She also befriends fellow criminal Harley Quinn, though Bernadeth later scolds her for associating with a mortal. Mad Harriet reappeared with the rest of the Female Furies as they battled Firestorm, Orion, and Hawkgirl on separate occasions. In Countdown #11, Mad Harriet was part of the battle against Mary Marvel, Harley Quinn and the second Catwoman. As Apokolips' Dog Soldiers open fired on Mary, she ducked and the bullets shredded Mad Harriet instead. In Final Crisis, Mad Harriet was one of the Furies whose spirit possessed some of Earth's heroines and villainess. Her vessel was Batwoman. =New 52= After Darkseid had been enslaved by his daughter Grail, Mad Harriet and the other Female Furies accepted an offer from Big Barda to help defeat Grail as well as to protect Barda's husband, Mister Miracle.Justice League #50 (2016) =DC Rebirth= After Lex Luthor claimed leadership of Apokolips, Mad Harriet joined Granny Goodness and the other Female Furies in the deadlands, awaiting Darkseid's return. She later participated in the battle against Kalibak's forces, though she was eventually defeated by her teammate Lois Lane after the Furies turned on the human when she revealed her relationship with Superman. Mad Harriet was imprisoned on Apokolips with Lashina, Stompa, and Granny Goodness when Superman became ruler of the planet.Superman #34-36 (2018) At some point later, Mad Harriet and her comrades were freed from their imprisonment by Darkseid, who had been slowly regaining his power on Earth. Along with the other Female Furies, Mad Harriet was assigned to seek out mystical artifacts that would further empower Darkseid.Wonder Woman #39 (2018) Steve Trevor and his team of soldiers called the Oddfellows prevented Mad Harriet and the Furies from stealing the relics, and in the ensuing battle Harriet, along with Lashina, was captured.Wonder Woman #41 (2018) Both Lashina and Mad Harriet refused to answer Wonder Woman's questions about Darkseid's plans which led to Wonder Woman freeing the two Furies and attempting to battle them for answers. The battle was interrupted by Darkseid, who had transported a chunk of the A.R.G.U.S. headquarters to his lair in the Amazon jungle.Wonder Woman #43 (2018) During the chaos, Mad Harriet battled the soldiers of A.R.G.U.S. and later fled when Darkseid was apparently killed by Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman #44 (2018) During the escalation of the war between Apokolips and New Genesis, Mad Harriet attended the birth of Jacob, the son of Big Barda and Mister Miracle.Mister Miracle #7 (2018) She also participated in the war against New Genesis.Mister Miracle #9 (2018) Powers and abilities Like a member of The Female Furies, Mad Harriet is superhumanly strong equal that her partners Lashina or Bernadeth. Her advanced physiology makes her extremely long-lived and immune to all diseases. Mad Harriet possesses a remarkable agility and flexibility above the other Female Furies. Due to the fact she is extremely insane, Harriet has a wild fighting style. Mad Harriet wears \\"power spikes\\" on her hands that crackle with energy. They can cause enough damage to harm even the most powerful metahumans of the DC universe.

It has an area of 4,000 square kilometers (1,500 mile¬≤). The park is located 120 kilometers south of Tehran and 100 kilometers east of Qom, and it sits on the western end of one of Iran's two major deserts, the Dasht-e Kavir (Great Salt Desert). Siahkuh (Black Mountain), a large, semi-circular rock outcropping sits in roughly the park's center. The park encompasses landscapes of desert and steppes, and is sometimes known as \\"Little Africa\\" for its safari-like wildlife, including native goats (Capra aegagrus), sheep (Ovis orientalis),Mohammadian,H. Mammals of Iran. Shabpareh Publishing Institute. Tehran, Iran.2005.. striped hyenas, Indian wolves, gazelles, the rare Asiatic cheetahs, and the Persian leopards. Typically, the area receives around 150 millimeters (6 inches) of rain a year, most of which falls between November and May. The vegetation in the region is adapted to drought and salty soils. To retain water and combat grazing by animals some plants grow leaves with thorns, much like thorn trees and bushes found in Africa desert landscapes. Namak Lake (Salt Lake) sits immediately outside the park boundaries. This is actually a salt marsh, and water flows into the lake from the north via the Qom River, which also flows through the northern part of Kavir National Park. The Qom is one of the very few permanent rivers through the entire desert expanse in Iran. The Kavir National Park lies in the central province of Semnan and spans an area of 440,000 hectares. Environment Local authorities consider insufficient labor force, excessive use of land to graze cattle and illegal hunting as the main problems the park is faced with. Despite the vastness of the park, only 30 rangers work there under the most difficult conditions and for minimum wage. A more detailed look, however, reveals that there are graver problems than those mentioned by the authorities: The major oil projects currently being implemented in the park are believed will eventually turn the area into a salt land. The area is frequently used for military maneuvers. The park is sometimes host to car racing competitions, which, together with the military maneuvers, have led many unique animal species, such as the Persian zebras and the Asian cheetahs to flee the area as they do not feel secure anymore.

Lie detection may refer to a cognitive process of detecting deception by evaluating message content as well as non-verbal cues. It also may refer to questioning techniques used along with technology that record physiological functions to ascertain truth and falsehood in response. The latter is commonly used by law enforcement in the United States, but rarely in other countries because it is based on pseudoscience. There are a wide variety of technologies available for this purpose. The most common and long used measure is the polygraph. A comprehensive 2003 review by the National Academy of Sciences of existing research concluded that there was \\"little basis for the expectation that a polygraph test could have extremely high accuracy.\\" There is no evidence to substantiate that non-verbal lie detection, such as by looking at body language, is an effective way to detect lies, even if it is widely used by law enforcement. General accuracy and limitations of assessment The cumulative research evidence suggests that machines do detect deception better than chance, but with significant error rates and that strategies used to \\"beat\\" polygraph examinations, so-called countermeasures, may be effective.The Truth About Lie Detectors. American Psychological Association. Despite unreliability, results are admissible in court in some countries such as Japan. Lie detector results are very rarely admitted in evidence in the US courts. In 1983 the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment published a review of the technology and found: :\\"...there is at present only limited scientific evidence for establishing the validity of polygraph testing. Even where the evidence seems to indicate that polygraph testing detects deceptive subjects better than chance, significant error rates are possible, and examiner and examinee differences and the use of countermeasures may further affect validity.\\" In the 2007 peer-reviewed academic article \\"Charlatanry in forensic speech science\\", the authors reviewed 50 years of lie detector research and came to the conclusion that there is no scientific evidence supporting that voice analysis lie detectors actually work. Lie detector manufacturer Nemesysco threatened to sue the academic publisher for libel resulting in removal of the article from online databases. In a letter to the publisher, Nemesysco's lawyers wrote that the authors of the article could be sued for defamation if they wrote on the subject again.All lies? Scientists threatened with legal action over lie detector article . Stockholm University.Threats over Swedish lie detector research . The Local. January 27, 2009.Online at: Nevertheless, extraneous \\"noise\\" on the polygraph can come from embarrassment or anxiety and not be specific to lying. When subjects are aware of the assessment their resulting emotional response, especially anxiety, can impact the data. Additionally, psychological disorders can cause problems with data as certain disorders can lead a person to make a statement they believe to be truth but is actually a fabrication. As well as with all testing, the examiner can cause biases within the test with their interaction with the subject and interpretation of the data. History =20th century= The study of physiological methods for deception tests measuring emotional disturbances began in the early 1900s. Vittorio Benussi was the first to work on practical deception tests based on physiological changes. He detected changes in inspiration-expiration ratio‚Äîfindings confirmed by N.E. Burtt. Burtt conducted studies that emphasized the changes in quantitative systolic blood-pressure. William Moulton Marston studied blood-pressure and noted increase in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or over indicated guilt through using the tycos sphygmomanometer, with which he reported 90‚Äì100% accuracy. His studies used students and actual court cases. Then in 1913 W.M. Marston determined systolic blood-pressure by oscillatory methods and his findings cite definite changes in blood pressure during the deception of criminal suspects. In 1921, John Augustus Larson criticized Marston's intermittent blood pressure method because emotional changes were so brief they could be lost. To adjust for this he modified the Erlanger sphygmograph to give a continuous blood pressure and pulse curve and used it to study 4,000 criminals.. In the 1990s, a team of scientists, Stanley Abrams, Jean M. Verdier and Oleg Maltsev developed a new methodology contributing six coefficients that positively affect the accuracy of the lie detector analysis results. =21st century= Two meta-analyses conducted by 2004 found an association between lying and increased pupil size and compressed lips. Liars may stay still more, use fewer hand gestures, and make less eye contact. Liars may take more time to answer questions but on the other hand, if they have had time to prepare, they may answer more quickly than people telling the truth would, and talk less, and repeat phrases more. They do not appear to be more fidgety, blink more, or have a less-relaxed posture. Paul Ekman has used the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and \\"when combined with voice and speech measures, [it] reaches detection accuracy rates of up to 90 percent.\\" However, there is currently no evidence to support such a claim. It is currently being automated for use in law enforcement and is still being improved to increase accuracy. His studies use micro-expressions, which last less than one-fifth of a second, and \\"may leak emotions someone wants to conceal, such as anger or guilt.\\" However, \\"signs of emotion aren't necessarily signs of guilt. An innocent person may be apprehensive and appear guilty,\\" Ekman reminds us. With regard to his studies, lies about emotions at the moment have the biggest payoff from face and voice cues while lies about beliefs and actions, such as crimes use cues from gestures and words are added. Ekman and his associates have validated many signs of deception, but do not publish all of them as not to educate criminals James Pennebaker uses the method of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), published by Lawrence Erlbaum, to conduct an analysis of written content. He claims it has accuracy in predicting lying. Pennebaker cites his method as \\"significantly more effective than human judges in correctly identifying deceptive or truthful writing samples\\"; there is a 67% accuracy rate with his method, while trained people have 52% accuracy. There were five experimental procedures used in this study. Study 1‚Äì3 asked participants to speak, hand write or type a true or false statement about abortion. The participants were randomly assigned to tell a true or false statement. Study 4 focused on feelings about friends and study 5 had the students involved in a mock crime and asked to lie. Human judges were asked to rate the truthfulness of the 400 communications dealing with abortion. The judges read or watched the statement and gave it a yes or no answer about if this statement was false or not. LIWC correctly classified 67% of the abortion communications and the judges correctly classified 52%. His studies have identified that deception carries three primary written markers. The first is fewer first-person pronouns. Those lying \\"avoid statements of ownership, distance themselves from their stories and avoid taking responsibility for their behavior\\" while also using more negative emotion words such as \\"hate, worthless and sad.\\" Second, they use \\"few exclusionary words such as except, but or nor\\" when \\"distinguish[ing] what they did from what they did not do.\\" More recently evidence has been provided by the work of CA Morgan III and GA Hazlett that a computer analysis of cognitive interview derived speech content (i.e. response length and unique word count) provides a method for detecting deception that is both demonstrably better than professional judgments of professionals and useful at distinguishing between genuine and false adult claims of exposure to highly stressful, potentially traumatic events. This method shows particular promise as it is non confrontational as well as scientifically and cross culturally valid. General questioning and testing techniques There are typically three types of questions used in polygraph testing or voice stress analysis testing: Irrelevant questions establish a baseline to compare other answers by asking simple questions with clear true and false answers. Comparison questions have an indirect relationship to the event or circumstance, and they are designed to encourage the subject to lie. Relevant questions are compared against comparison questions (which should represent false answers) and irrelevant questions (which should represent true answers). They are about whatever is particularly in question.  Deception  Deception is the action of one person attempting to convince another person to accept something as correct that they believe as incorrect or denying what is correct and is often used to avoid punishment or gain a benefit.G. Ganis, S.M. Kosslyn, S. Stose, W.L. Thompson, D.A. Yurgelun-Todd, Neural Correlates of Different Types of Deception: An fMRI Investigation, Cerebral Cortex, Volume 13, Issue 8, August 2003, Pages 830‚Äì836, https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/13.8.830 There are many styles of lying. A spontaneous or artificial deception is constructed based on a mixture of information already stored in semantic and episodic memory. It is isolated and easier to generate because it lacks cross-checking into the larger picture. This style contrasts memorized lies that aren‚Äôt as rich in detail but are retrieved from memory. They often fit into an actual scenario to make recall easier. The control question test and the guilty knowledge test The control question test (CQT) uses control questions, with known answers, to serve as a physiological baseline in order to compare them with questions relevant to a particular incident. The control question should have a greater physiological response if truth was told and a lesser physiological response for lying. The guilty knowledge test (GKT) is a multiple-choice format in which answer choices or one correct answer and additional incorrect answers are read and the physiological response is recorded. The controls are the incorrect alternative answers. The greater physiological response should be to the correct answer. Its point is to determine if the subject has knowledge about a particular event. Both are considered to be biased against those that are innocent, because the guilty who fear the consequences of being found out can be more motivated to cheat on the test. Various techniques (which can be found online) can teach individuals how to change the results of the tests, including curling the toes, and biting the tongue. Mental arithmetic was found to be ineffective by at least one study, especially in students counting backward by seven. A study has found that in the guilty knowledge test subjects can focusing on the alternative answers and make themselves look innocent. Polygraph Lie detection commonly involves the polygraph, and is used to test both styles of deception. It detects autonomic reactions, such as micro-expressions, breathing rate, skin conductivity, and heart rate.Forensic Psychology. BBC Science & Nature. Microexpressions are the brief and incomplete nonverbal changes in expression while the rest show an activation of the nervous system. These changes in body functions are not easily controlled by the conscious mind. They also may consider respiration rate, blood pressure, capillary dilation, and muscular movement. While taking a polygraph test the subject wears a blood pressure device to measure blood pressure fluctuations. Respiration is measured by wearing pneumographs around the chest, and finally electrodes are placed on the subject's fingers to measure skin conductivity. To determine truth it is assumed the subject will show more signs of fear when answering the control questions compared with the relevant questions. Polygraphs focus more on the exams predictive value of guilt by comparing the responses of the participant to control questions, irrelevant questions, and relevant questions to gauge arousal, which is then interpreted as a display of fear and deception is assumed. If a person is showing a deception there will be changes in the autonomic arousal responses to the relevant questions. Results are considered inconclusive if there is no fluctuation in any of the questions. These measures are supposed to indicate a short-term stress response which can be from lying or significance to the subject. The problem becomes that they are also associated with mental effort and emotional state, so they can be influenced by fear, anger, and surprise for example. This technique may also be used with CQT and GKT. There are many issues with polygraph tests because many people have found ways to try and cheat the system. Some people have been known to take sedatives to reduce anxiety; using antiperspirant to prevent sweating; and positioning pins or biting parts of the mouth after each question to demonstrate a constant physiological response.As technology and research have developed many have moved away from polygraphing because of the drawbacks of this style of detection. Polygraphing has a 70% accuracy rate, which is only 16% better than lie detection in the general population.Rusconi, Elena, and Timothy Mitchener- Nissen. ‚ÄúProspects of functional magnetic resonance imaging as lie detector.‚Äù Frontiers in human neurosciencevol. 7 594. 24 Sep. 2013, doi:10.3389/fnhum.2013.00594 Activities of the body not easily controlled by the conscious mind are compared under different circumstances. Usually this involves asking the subject control questions where the answers are known to the examiner and comparing them to questions where the answers are not known. Critics claim that \\"lie detection\\" by use of polygraphy has no scientific validity because it is not a scientific procedure.The Lie Behind the Lie Detector by George W. Maschke and Gino J. Scalabrini Government agencies, such as the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, and even the Department of Energy currently use polygraphs. They are regularly used by these agencies to screen employees. The problem with evaluating the effectiveness of polygraphs through field studies is that the use of confessions overestimates accuracy. Someone who has failed the test is more likely to confess than someone who has passed, contributing to polygraph examiners not learning about mistakes they have made and thus improving. Cognitive polygraph Recent developments that permit non-invasive monitoring using functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD) technique showed that successful problem-solving employs a discrete knowledge strategy (DKS) that selects neural pathways represented in one hemisphere, while unsuccessful outcome implicates a non-discrete knowledge strategy (nDKS). A polygraphic test could be viewed as a working memory task. This suggests that the DKS model may have a correlate in mnemonic operations. In other words, the DKS model may have a discrete knowledge base (DKB) of essential components needed for task resolution, while for nDKS, DKB is absent and, hence, a \\"global\\" or bi-hemispheric search occurs. Based on the latter premise, a 'lie detector' system was designed as described in . A pattern of blood-flow-velocity changes is obtained in response to questions that include correct and incorrect answers. The wrong answer will elicit bi-hemispheric activation, from correct answer that activates unilateral response. Cognitive polygraphy based on this system is devoid of any subjective control of mental processes and, hence, high reliability and specificity; however, this is yet to be tested in forensic practice. See also cognitive biometrics. ERP Event-related potentials assess recognition, and therefore may or may not be effective in assessing deception. In ERP studies P3 amplitude waves are assessed, with these waves being large when an item is recognized. However, P100 amplitudes have been observed to have significant correlation to trustworthiness ratings, the importance of which will be discussed in the EEG section. This, along with other studies leads some to purport that because ERP studies rely on quick perceptual processes they \\"are integral to the detection of deception.\\" EEG Electroencephalography, or EEG, measures brain activity through electrodes attached to the scalp of a subject. The object is to identify the recognition of meaningful data through this activity. Images or objects are shown to the subject while questioning techniques are implemented to determine recognition. This can include crime scene images, for example. Perceived trustworthiness is interpreted by the individual from looking at a face, and this decreases when someone is lying. Such observations are \\"too subtle to be explicitly processed by observers, but [do] affect implicit cognitive and affective processes.\\" These results, in a study by Heussen, Binkofski, and Jolij, were obtained through a study with an N400 paradigm including two conditions within the experiment: truthful faces and lying faces. Faces flashed for 100ms and then the participants rated them. However, the limitations of this study would be that it only had 15 participants and the mean age was 24. Eye-tracking John Kircher, Doug Hacker, Anne Cook, Dan Woltz and David Raskin have developed eye-tracking technology at the University of Utah that they consider a polygraph alternative. This is not an emotional reaction like the polygraph and other methods but rather a cognitive reaction. This technology measures pupil dilation, response time, reading and rereading time, and errors. Data is recorded while subjects answer true or false questions on a computer. They have found that more effort is required by lying than giving the truth and thus their aim is to find indications of hard work. Individuals not telling the truth might, for instance, have dilated pupils while also taking longer to answer the question. Eye-tracking offers several benefits over the polygraph: lower cost, 1/5th of the time to conduct, subjects do not need to be \\"hooked up\\" to anything, and it does not require qualified polygraph examiners to give the test. Voice stress analysis Voice stress analysis (also called voice risk analysis) uses computers to compare pitch, frequency, intensity and micro tremors. In this way voice analysis \\"detect[s] minute variations in the voice thought to signal lying.\\" It can even be used covertly over the phone, and has been used by banking and insurance companies as well as the government of the United Kingdom. Customers are assessed for truth in certain situations by banks and insurance companies where computers are used to record responses. Software then compares control questions to relevant questions assessed for deception. However, its reliability has been debated by peer-reviewed journals. \\"When a person lies, an involuntary interference of the nerves causes the vocal cords to produce a distorted sound wave, namely a frequency level which is different from the one produced by the same person when telling the truth.\\"S.

Eighteen of these suspects later confessed, making the deception the most likely ground truth. With 48% accurate classification, VSA performed at chance level. Several other studies showed similar results (Damphousse, 2008; Harnsberger, Hollien, Martin, & Hollien, 2009).

The Polygraph and Lie Detection. Committee to review the scientific evidence on the polygraph. Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education. Washington, DC: The National Academic Press. fMRI = Future = Researchers have turned to looking for other ways to track deception. The most promising fields are fMRI and EEG. EEG and fMRI both look to the central nervous system to compare time and topography of activity in the brain for lie detection. While a polygraph detects changes in activity in the peripheral nervous system, fMRI has the potential to catch the lie at the 'source'. To better understand why fMRI, lie detection is the future of lie detection one must first understand how it works. = fMRI = As Prospects of fMRI as a Lie Detector states, fMRIs use electromagnets to create pulse sequences in the cells of the brain. The fMRI scanner then detects the different pulses and fields that are used to distinguish tissue structures and the distinction between layers of the brain, matter type, and the ability to see growths. The functional component allows researchers to see activation in the brain over time and assess efficiency and connectivity by compairing blood use in the brain, which allows for the identification of which portions of the brain are using more oxygen, and thus being used during a specific task. This is called the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent or BOLD hemodynamic response.. fMRI is a correlational machine that looks at both brain structure and activity, yet it does not allow for causal conclusions about brain areas and behaviors or mental processes. = Research = To study deception researchers map the systematic procedure the brain went through to produce the action or decision. Subjects are often offered monetary incentive for their participation. To begin it is important to note areas of the brain that are activated in telling the truth. In an experiment where participants were asked to provide an honest answer based on pre-checked information. = Brain Activation = Activation of BA 40, the superior parietal lobe, the lateral left MRG, the striatum, and left thalamus was unique to truth while activation of the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum will be used to show a similar network for truth and lie. The most brain activity occurs in both sides of the prefrontal cortex, which is linked to response inhibition. This indicates that deception may involve inhibition of truthful responses. Overall bilateral activation occurs in deception in the middle frontal gyrus, Parahippocampal gyrus, the precuneus, and the cerebellum. When looking into the different styles of lying we see differentiation in the locations of activation. Spontaneous lies require retrieval from the semantic and episodic memory to be able to quickly formulate a viable situation that remains in working memory while visual images are created to further hide the truth. The areas associated with this retrieval, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior prefrontal cortex, and precuneus, are activated as well as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and posterior visual cortex are activated. The anterior cingulate cortex is used for cross-checking and probability. For well- rehearsed, memorized, and coherent lies episodic memory activation is needed. This creates increased activation in the right anterior prefrontal cortex, BA 10, and the precuneus. The Parahippocampal cortex may be used in this process to generalize lies to situations because no cross-checking is needed. Newer studies have considered the salience of lying in a variety of situations. If a lie is of lower salience activation is broader and general while salient lies have specific activation in regions associated with inhibition and selection.Langleben, D.D., Loughead, J.W., Bilker, W.B., Ruparel, K., Childress, A.R., Busch, S.I. and Gur, R.C. (2005), Telling truth from lie in individual subjects with fast event‚Äêrelated fMRI. Hum. Brain Mapp., 26: 262-272. doi:10.1002/hbm.20191 Many areas are much more active in lying than truth possibly meaning its harder to retrieve false information compared to true memories because truth has more encoded retrieval cues. Interestingly, the limbic system, which is involved in many different emotional responses including the sympathetic nervous system, is not activated in deception.Commentary: The Future of Forensic Functional Brain Imaging Daniel D. Langleben, Frank M. Dattilio Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online Dec 2008, 36 (4) 502-504; = Legality = Historically, fMRI lie detector tests have not been allowed into evidence in legal proceedings, the most famous attempt being Harvey Nathan‚Äôs insurance fraud case in 2007. This pushback from the legal system may be based on the 1988 Federal Employment Polygraph Protection Act that acts to protect citizens from incriminating themselves and the right to silence. The legal system specifically would require many more studies on the negative false rate to decide if the absence of deception proves innocence. The lack of legal support has not stopped companies like No Lie MRI and CEPHOS from offering private fMRI scans to test deception. = Pros and Cons = While fMRI studies on deception have claimed detection accuracy as high as 90% many have problems with implementing this style of detection. At a basic level administering, fMRIs is extremely difficult and costly. Only yes or no answers can be used which allows for flexibility in the truth and style of lying. fMRI requires the participant to remain still for long periods and little movements can create issues with the scan. Some people are unable to take one such as those with medical conditions, claustrophobia, or implants. When looking at deception specifically, there is little research on non-compliant individuals. The criminal justice system interacts with many types of criminals that are not often taken into account in fMRI studies such as addicts, juveniles, mentally unstable, and the elderly. Studies have been done on Chinese individuals and their language and cultural differences did not change results, as well as a study (S. Spence 2011) on that 52 schizophrenic patients, 27 of whom were experiencing delusions at the time of the study. While these studies are promising, the lack of extensive research on the populations that would be most affected by fMRIs being admitted into the legal system is a huge drawback. As well, fMRI deception tests look only at changes in activity in the brain which similarly to the polygraph does not show directly that lying is occurring. If dealing with complex styles of lying or questions the need for a control conditionLangleben, D.D., Loughead, J.W., Bilker, W.B., Ruparel, K., Childress, A.R., Busch, S.I. and Gur, R.C. (2005), Telling truth from lie in individual subjects with fast event‚Äêrelated fMRI. Hum. Brain Mapp., 26: 262-272. doi:10.1002/hbm.20191 is critical to differentiate from other higher emotional states unrelated to deception. Some studies, such as Ganis et al., have shown that it is possible to fool an fMRI by learning countermeasures. fNIRS Functional near-infrared spectroscopy also detects oxygen and activity in the brain like the fMRI, but instead it looks at blood oxygen levels. It is advantageous to the fMRI because it is portable, however its image resolution is of lower quality than the fMRI. Brain observations Electroencephalography is used to detect changes in brain waves. Cognitive chronometry, or the measurement of the time taken to perform mental operations, can be used to distinguish lying from truth- telling. One recent instrument using cognitive chronometry for this purpose is the timed antagonistic response alethiometer, or TARA. Brain-reading uses fMRI and the multiple voxels activated in the brain evoked by a stimulus to determine what the brain has detected, and so whether it is familiar. Nonverbal behavior People often evaluate lies based on non-verbal behavior, but are quick to place too much merit in misleading indicators, such as: avoidance of eye contact, increased pauses between statements, and excessive movements originating from the hands or feet. Non-invasive lie detection using non-verbal behavior is performed by the Silent Talker Lie Detector. Silent Talker monitors large numbers of microexpressions over time slots and encodes them into large vectors which are classified as showing truthful or deceptive behavior by artificial intelligence or statistical classifiers. Silent Talker research has been peer-reviewed in the Journal of Applied Cognitive Psychology and in the Journal of Neural Computing and Applications. The architecture was invented between 2000 and 2002 by a team at Manchester Metropolitan University. Drugs Truth drugs such as sodium thiopental, ethanol, and cannabis (historically speaking) are used for the purposes of obtaining accurate information from an unwilling subject. Information obtained by publicly disclosed truth drugs has been shown to be highly unreliable, with subjects apparently freely mixing fact and fantasy. Much of the claimed effect relies on the belief of the subjects that they cannot tell a lie while under the influence of the drug.

In 1994, the first Jittery Joe‚Äôs opened in downtown Athens, near the famed 40 Watt Club. Open 24 hours a day, they offered fresh coffee roasted in-store. There are now five locations in Athens, two in Watkinsville, Georgia, and one each in the Georgia cities of Cartersville, Alpharetta, and Buford.  Overview  The inspiration for the name Jittery Joe‚Äôs came from an episode of The Simpsons, in which Marge visits a diner of that name. The founders discovered that Jittery Joe‚Äôs was not trademarked, and so adopted it as the brand label of the coffee company. Jittery Joe's expanded into the New York market in August 2009, opening a shop next door to the Laboratory Institute of Merchandising (LIM). Drawing acclaim from the New York Times within a month of opening, the store instantly became a Midtown favorite. The store closed in January 2013. Jittery Joe's occasionally collaborates with local artists, such as with the recording of Jeff Mangum's album Live at Jittery Joe's and releasing lines of coffee for Kishi Bashi and Widespread Panic. Along with music artists, Jittery Joe‚Äôs has partnered with several other local Athens businesses, such as Terrapin Beer Company, BikeAthens, and Kindercore Vinyl to create custom coffee blends. In December 2016, the company partnered with the local group Extra Special People to create Java Joy, a program to provide people with disabilities opportunities in the workforce. Jittery Joe's began teaching participants how to roast and serve coffee in 2018, then provided a mobile coffee cart which the employees use to serve the brand's coffee while engaging with local communities and events.

In a metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (MOS) active-pixel sensor, MOS field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) are used as amplifiers. There are different types of APS, including the early NMOS APS and the much more common complementary MOS (CMOS) APS, also known as the CMOS sensor, which is widely used in digital camera technologies such as cell phone cameras, web cameras, most modern digital pocket cameras, most digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs), and mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs). CMOS sensors emerged as an alternative to charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors and eventually outsold them by the mid-2000s. CMOS image sensor. The term 'active pixel sensor' is also used to refer to the individual pixel sensor itself, as opposed to the image sensor.Alexander G. Dickinson et al., \\"Active pixel sensor and imaging system having differential mode\\", In this case, the image sensor is sometimes called an active pixel sensor imager, or active-pixel image sensor.Lawrence T. Clark, Mark A. Beiley, Eric J. Hoffman, \\"Sensor cell having a soft saturation circuit\\" History =Background= While researching metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (MOS) technology, Willard Boyle and George E. Smith realized that an electric charge could be stored on a tiny MOS capacitor, which became the basic building block of the charge-couple device (CCD), which they invented in 1969. An issue with CCD technology was that it required the need for nearly perfect charge transfer, which, according to Eric Fossum, \\"makes their radiation 'soft,' difficult to use under low light conditions, difficult to manufacture in large array sizes, difficult to integrate with on-chip electronics, difficult to use at low temperatures, difficult to use at high frame rates, and difficult to manufacture in non- silicon materials that extend wavelength response.\\" At RCA Laboratories, a research team including Paul K. Weimer, W.S. Pike and G. Sadasiv in 1969 proposed a solid-state image sensor with scanning circuits using thin-film transistors (TFTs), with photoconductive film used for the photodetector. A low-resolution \\"mostly digital\\" N-channel MOSFET (NMOS) imager with intra- pixel amplification, for an optical mouse application, was demonstrated by Richard F. Lyon in 1981. Another type of image sensor technology that is related to the APS is the hybrid infrared focal plane array (IRFPA), designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures in the infrared spectrum. The devices are two chips that are put together like a sandwich: one chip contains detector elements made in InGaAs or HgCdTe, and the other chip is typically made of silicon and is used to read out the photodetectors. The exact date of origin of these devices is classified, but they were in use by the mid-1980s. A key element of the modern CMOS sensor is the pinned photodiode (PPD). It was invented by Nobukazu Teranishi, Hiromitsu Shiraki and Yasuo Ishihara at NEC in 1980, and then publicly reported by Teranishi and Ishihara with A. Kohono, E. Oda and K. Arai in 1982, with the addition of an anti-blooming structure. The pinned photodiode is a photodetector structure with low lag, low noise, high quantum efficiency and low dark current. The new photodetector structure invented at NEC was given the name \\"pinned photodiode\\" (PPD) by B.C. Burkey at Kodak in 1984. In 1987, the PPD began to be incorporated into most CCD sensors, becoming a fixture in consumer electronic video cameras and then digital still cameras. Since then, the PPD has been used in nearly all CCD sensors and then CMOS sensors. =Passive-pixel sensor= The precursor to the APS was the passive-pixel sensor (PPS), a type of photodiode array (PDA). A passive-pixel sensor consists of passive pixels which are read out without amplification, with each pixel consisting of a photodiode and a MOSFET switch. In a photodiode array, pixels contain a p-n junction, integrated capacitor, and MOSFETs as selection transistors. A photodiode array was proposed by G. Weckler in 1968, predating the CCD. This was the basis for the PPS, which had image sensor elements with in-pixel selection transistors, proposed by Peter J.W. Noble in 1968, (Noble was later presented with an award for 'Seminal contributions to the early years of image sensors' by the International Image sensor Society in 2015.) and by Savvas G. Chamberlain in 1969. Passive-pixel sensors were being investigated as a solid-state alternative to vacuum-tube imaging devices. The MOS passive-pixel sensor used just a simple switch in the pixel to read out the photodiode integrated charge. Pixels were arrayed in a two-dimensional structure, with an access enable wire shared by pixels in the same row, and output wire shared by column. At the end of each column was a transistor. Passive-pixel sensors suffered from many limitations, such as high noise, slow readout, and lack of scalability. Early photodiode arrays were complex and impractical, requiring selection transistors to be fabricated within each pixel, along with on-chip multiplexer circuits. The noise of photodiode arrays was also a limitation to performance, as the photodiode readout bus capacitance resulted in increased noise level. Correlated double sampling (CDS) could also not be used with a photodiode array without external memory. It was not possible to fabricate active pixel sensors with a practical pixel size in the 1970s, due to limited microlithography technology at the time. Because the MOS process was so variable and MOS transistors had characteristics that changed over time (Vth instability), the CCD's charge- domain operation was more manufacturable than MOS passive pixel sensors. =Active-pixel sensor= The active-pixel sensor consists of active pixels, each containing one or more MOSFET amplifiers which convert the photo- generated charge to a voltage, amplify the signal voltage, and reduce noise. The concept of an active-pixel device was proposed by Peter Noble in 1968. He created created sensor arrays with active MOS readout amplifiers per pixel, in essentially the modern three-transistor configuration: the buried photodiode- structure, selection transistor and MOS amplifier. The MOS active-pixel concept was implemented as the charge modulation device (CMD) by Olympus in Japan during the mid-1980s. This was enabled by advances in MOSFET semiconductor device fabrication, with MOSFET scaling reaching smaller micron and then sub-micron levels during the 1980s to early 1990s. The first MOS APS was fabricated by Tsutomu Nakamura's team at Olympus in 1985. The term active pixel sensor (APS) was coined by Nakamura while working on the CMD active- pixel sensor at Olympus. The CMD imager had a vertical APS structure, which increases fill-factor (or reduces pixel size) by storing the signal charge under an output NMOS transistor. Other Japanese semiconductor companies soon followed with their own active pixel sensors during the late 1980s to early 1990s. Between 1988 and 1991, Toshiba developed the \\"double-gate floating surface transistor\\" sensor, which had a lateral APS structure, with each pixel containing a buried-channel MOS photogate and a PMOS output amplifier. Between 1989 and 1992, Canon developed the base-stored image sensor (BASIS), which used a vertical APS structure similar to the Olympus sensor, but with bipolar transistors rather than MOSFETs. In the early 1990s, American companies began developing practical MOS active pixel sensors. In 1991, Texas Instruments developed the bulk CMD (BCMD) sensor, which was fabricated at the company's Japanese branch and had a vertical APS structure similar to the Olympus CMD sensor, but was more complex and used PMOS rather than NMOS transistors. =CMOS sensor= By the late 1980s to early 1990s, the CMOS process was well- established as a well-controlled stable semiconductor manufacturing process and was the baseline process for almost all logic and microprocessors. There was a resurgence in the use of passive-pixel sensors for low-end imaging applications, while active-pixel sensors began being used for low-resolution high-function applications such as retina simulation and high-energy particle detectors. However, CCDs continued to have much lower temporal noise and fixed-pattern noise and were the dominant technology for consumer applications such as camcorders as well as for broadcast cameras, where they were displacing video camera tubes. In 1993, the first practical APS to be successfully fabricated outside of Japan was developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which fabricated a CMOS compatible APS, with its development led by Eric Fossum. It had a lateral APS structure similar to the Toshiba sensor, but was fabricated with CMOS rather than PMOS transistors. It was the first CMOS sensor with intra-pixel charge transfer. Fossum, who worked at JPL, led the development of an image sensor that used intra-pixel charge transfer along with an in-pixel amplifier to achieve true correlated double sampling (CDS) and low temporal noise operation, and on-chip circuits for fixed-pattern noise reduction. He also published an extensive 1993 article predicting the emergence of APS imagers as the commercial successor of CCDs. The active pixel sensor (APS) was broadly defined by Fossum in this paper. He classified two types of APS structures, the lateral APS and the vertical APS. He also gave an overview of the history of APS technology, from the first APS sensors in Japan to the development of the CMOS sensor at JPL. In 1994, Fossum proposed an improvement to the CMOS sensor: the integration of the pinned photodiode (PPD). A CMOS sensor with PPD technology was first fabricated in 1995 by a joint JPL and Kodak team that included Fossum along with P. P. K. Lee, R. C. Gee, R. M. Guidash and T. H. Lee. Between 1993 and 1995, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed a number of prototype devices, which validated the key features of the technology. Though primitive, these devices demonstrated good image performance with high readout speed and low power consumption. In 1995, being frustrated by the slow pace of the technology's adoption, Fossum and his then-wife Dr. Sabrina Kemeny co-founded Photobit Corporation to commercialize the technology. It continued to develop and commercialize APS technology for a number of applications, such as web cams, high speed and motion capture cameras, digital radiography, endoscopy (pill) cameras, digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs) and camera-phones. Many other small image sensor companies also sprang to life shortly thereafter due to the accessibility of the CMOS process and all quickly adopted the active pixel sensor approach. Photobit's CMOS sensors found their way into webcams manufactured by Logitech and Intel, before Photobit was purchased by Micron Technology in 2001. The early CMOS sensor market was initially led by American manufacturers such as Micron, and Omnivision, allowing the United States to briefly recapture a portion of the overall image sensor market from Japan, before the CMOS sensor market eventually came to be dominated by Japan, South Korea and China. The CMOS sensor with PPD technology was further advanced and refined by R. M. Guidash in 1997, K. Yonemoto and H. Sumi in 2000, and I. Inoue in 2003. This led to CMOS sensors achieve imaging performance on par with CCD sensors, and later exceeding CCD sensors. By 2000, CMOS sensors were used in a variety of applications, including low-cost cameras, PC cameras, fax, multimedia, security, surveillance, and videophones. The video industry switched to CMOS cameras with the advent of high-definition video (HD video), as the large number of pixels would require significantly higher power consumption with CCD sensors, which would overheat and drain batteries. Sony in 2007 commercialized CMOS sensors with an original column A/D conversion circuit, for fast, low-noise performance, followed in 2009 by the CMOS back- illuminated sensor (BI sensor), with twice the sensitivity of conventional image sensors and going beyond the human eye. CMOS sensors went on to have a significant cultural impact, leading to the mass proliferation of digital cameras and camera phones, which bolstered the rise of social media and selfie culture, and impacted social and political movements around the world. By 2007, sales of CMOS active-pixel sensors had surpassed CCD sensors, with CMOS sensors accounting for 54% of the global image sensor market at the time. By 2012, CMOS sensors increased their share to 74% of the market. As of 2017, CMOS sensors account for 89% of global image sensor sales. In recent years, the CMOS sensor technology has spread to medium-format photography with Phase One being the first to launch a medium format digital back with a Sony-built CMOS sensor. In 2012, Sony introduced the stacked CMOS BI sensor. Fossum now performs research on the Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) technology. The QIS is a revolutionary change in the way we collect images in a camera that is being invented at Dartmouth. In the QIS, the goal is to count every photon that strikes the image sensor, and to provide resolution of 1 billion or more specialized photoelements (called jots) per sensor, and to read out jot bit planes hundreds or thousands of times per second resulting in terabits/sec of data. Boyd Fowler of OmniVision is known for his work in CMOS image sensor development. His contributions include the first digital-pixel CMOS image sensor in 1994; the first scientific linear CMOS image sensor with single- electron RMS read noise in 2003; the first multi-megapixel scientific area CMOS image sensor with simultaneous high dynamic range (86dB), fast readout (100 frames/second) and ultra-low read noise (1.2e- RMS) (sCMOS) in 2010. He also patented the first CMOS image sensor for inter-oral dental X-rays with clipped corners for better patient comfort. By the late 2010s CMOS sensors had largely if not completely replaced CCD sensors, as CMOS sensors can not only be made in existing semiconductor production lines, reducing costs, but they also consume less power, just to name a few advantages. (see below) Comparison to CCDs APS pixels solve the speed and scalability issues of the passive-pixel sensor. They generally consume less power than CCDs, have less image lag, and require less specialized manufacturing facilities. Unlike CCDs, APS sensors can combine the image sensor function and image processing functions within the same integrated circuit. APS sensors have found markets in many consumer applications, especially camera phones. They have also been used in other fields including digital radiography, military ultra high speed image acquisition, security cameras, and optical mice. Manufacturers include Aptina Imaging (independent spinout from Micron Technology, who purchased Photobit in 2001), Canon, Samsung, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba, OmniVision Technologies, Sony, and Foveon, among others. CMOS-type APS sensors are typically suited to applications in which packaging, power management, and on- chip processing are important. CMOS type sensors are widely used, from high- end digital photography down to mobile-phone cameras. =Advantages of CMOS compared with CCD= Blooming in a CCD image A primary advantage of a CMOS sensor is that it is typically less expensive to produce than a CCD sensor, as the image capturing and image sensing elements can be combined onto the same IC, with simpler construction required. A CMOS sensor also typically has better control of blooming (that is, of bleeding of photo-charge from an over- exposed pixel into other nearby pixels). In three-sensor camera systems that use separate sensors to resolve the red, green, and blue components of the image in conjunction with beam splitter prisms, the three CMOS sensors can be identical, whereas most splitter prisms require that one of the CCD sensors has to be a mirror image of the other two to read out the image in a compatible order. Unlike CCD sensors, CMOS sensors have the ability to reverse the addressing of the sensor elements. CMOS Sensors with a film speed of ISO 4 million exist. =Disadvantages of CMOS compared with CCD= Distortion caused by a rolling shutter Since a CMOS sensor typically captures a row at a time within approximately 1/60 or 1/50 of a second (depending on refresh rate) it may result in a \\"rolling shutter\\" effect, where the image is skewed (tilted to the left or right, depending on the direction of camera or subject movement). For example, when tracking a car moving at high speed, the car will not be distorted but the background will appear to be tilted. A frame-transfer CCD sensor or \\"global shutter\\" CMOS sensor does not have this problem; instead it captures the entire image at once into a frame store. A long-standing advantage of CCD sensors has been their capability for capturing images with lower noise. With improvements in CMOS technology, this advantage has closed as of 2020, with modern CMOS sensors available capable of outperforming CCD sensors. The active circuitry in CMOS pixels takes some area on the surface which is not light-sensitive, reducing the photon-detection efficiency of the device (back-illuminated sensors can mitigate this problem). But the frame- transfer CCD also has about half non-sensitive area for the frame store nodes, so the relative advantages depend on which types of sensors are being compared. Architecture =Pixel= A three-transistor active pixel sensor. The standard CMOS APS pixel today consists of a photodetector (pinned photodiode), a floating diffusion, and the so-called 4T cell consisting of four CMOS (complementary metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor) transistors, including a transfer gate, reset gate, selection gate and source-follower readout transistor. The pinned photodiode was originally used in interline transfer CCDs due to its low dark current and good blue response, and when coupled with the transfer gate, allows complete charge transfer from the pinned photodiode to the floating diffusion (which is further connected to the gate of the read- out transistor) eliminating lag. The use of intrapixel charge transfer can offer lower noise by enabling the use of correlated double sampling (CDS). The Noble 3T pixel is still sometimes used since the fabrication requirements are less complex. The 3T pixel comprises the same elements as the 4T pixel except the transfer gate and the photodiode. The reset transistor, Mrst, acts as a switch to reset the floating diffusion to VRST, which in this case is represented as the gate of the Msf transistor. When the reset transistor is turned on, the photodiode is effectively connected to the power supply, VRST, clearing all integrated charge. Since the reset transistor is n-type, the pixel operates in soft reset. The read-out transistor, Msf, acts as a buffer (specifically, a source follower), an amplifier which allows the pixel voltage to be observed without removing the accumulated charge. Its power supply, VDD, is typically tied to the power supply of the reset transistor VRST. The select transistor, Msel, allows a single row of the pixel array to be read by the read-out electronics. Other innovations of the pixels such as 5T and 6T pixels also exist. By adding extra transistors, functions such as global shutter, as opposed to the more common rolling shutter, are possible. In order to increase the pixel densities, shared-row, four-ways and eight-ways shared read out, and other architectures can be employed. A variant of the 3T active pixel is the Foveon X3 sensor invented by Dick Merrill. In this device, three photodiodes are stacked on top of each other using planar fabrication techniques, each photodiode having its own 3T circuit. Each successive layer acts as a filter for the layer below it shifting the spectrum of absorbed light in successive layers. By deconvolving the response of each layered detector, red, green, and blue signals can be reconstructed. =Array= A typical two-dimensional array of pixels is organized into rows and columns. Pixels in a given row share reset lines, so that a whole row is reset at a time. The row select lines of each pixel in a row are tied together as well. The outputs of each pixel in any given column are tied together. Since only one row is selected at a given time, no competition for the output line occurs. Further amplifier circuitry is typically on a column basis. =Size= The size of the pixel sensor is often given in height and width, but also in the optical format. =Lateral and vertical structures= There are two types of active-pixel sensor (APS) structures, the lateral APS and vertical APS. Eric Fossum defines the lateral APS as follows: Fossum defines the vertical APS as follows: =Thin-film transistors= A two-transistor active/passive pixel sensor For applications such as large-area digital X-ray imaging, thin-film transistors (TFTs) can also be used in APS architecture. However, because of the larger size and lower transconductance gain of TFTs compared with CMOS transistors, it is necessary to have fewer on-pixel TFTs to maintain image resolution and quality at an acceptable level. A two-transistor APS/PPS architecture has been shown to be promising for APS using amorphous silicon TFTs. In the two-transistor APS architecture on the right, TAMP is used as a switched-amplifier integrating functions of both Msf and Msel in the three-transistor APS. This results in reduced transistor counts per pixel, as well as increased pixel transconductance gain. Here, Cpix is the pixel storage capacitance, and it is also used to capacitively couple the addressing pulse of the \\"Read\\" to the gate of TAMP for ON-OFF switching. Such pixel readout circuits work best with low capacitance photoconductor detectors such as amorphous selenium. Design variants Many different pixel designs have been proposed and fabricated. The standard pixel is the most common because it uses the fewest wires and the fewest, most tightly packed transistors possible for an active pixel. It is important that the active circuitry in a pixel take up as little space as possible to allow more room for the photodetector. High transistor count hurts fill factor, that is, the percentage of the pixel area that is sensitive to light. Pixel size can be traded for desirable qualities such as noise reduction or reduced image lag. Noise is a measure of the accuracy with which the incident light can be measured. Lag occurs when traces of a previous frame remain in future frames, i.e. the pixel is not fully reset. The voltage noise variance in a soft-reset (gate-voltage regulated) pixel is V_n^2= kT/2C, but image lag and fixed pattern noise may be problematic. In rms electrons, the noise is N_e= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{kTC/2}}{q}. =Hard reset= Operating the pixel via hard reset results in a Johnson‚ÄìNyquist noise on the photodiode of V_n^2= kT/C or N_e= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{kTC}}{q}, but prevents image lag, sometimes a desirable tradeoff. One way to use hard reset is replace Mrst with a p-type transistor and invert the polarity of the RST signal. The presence of the p-type device reduces fill factor, as extra space is required between p- and n-devices; it also removes the possibility of using the reset transistor as an overflow anti-blooming drain, which is a commonly exploited benefit of the n-type reset FET. Another way to achieve hard reset, with the n-type FET, is to lower the voltage of VRST relative to the on-voltage of RST. This reduction may reduce headroom, or full-well charge capacity, but does not affect fill factor, unless VDD is then routed on a separate wire with its original voltage. =Combinations of hard and soft reset= Techniques such as flushed reset, pseudo-flash reset, and hard-to-soft reset combine soft and hard reset. The details of these methods differ, but the basic idea is the same. First, a hard reset is done, eliminating image lag. Next, a soft reset is done, causing a low noise reset without adding any lag.IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 50, NO. 1, JANUARY 2003 Pseudo-flash reset requires separating VRST from VDD, while the other two techniques add more complicated column circuitry. Specifically, pseudo-flash reset and hard-to-soft reset both add transistors between the pixel power supplies and the actual VDD. The result is lower headroom, without affecting fill factor. =Active reset= A more radical pixel design is the active-reset pixel. Active reset can result in much lower noise levels. The tradeoff is a complicated reset scheme, as well as either a much larger pixel or extra column-level circuitry.

Hugh Sempill (or Semple) (in Latin, Hugo Simpelius or Sempilius) (between 1589 and 1596 - 1654) was a Scottish Jesuit mathematician and linguist. He describes himself in his work as Hugo Sempilius Craigbaitaeus, probably making him the Hew Sempill of Craigbait and Langside found in local genealogies, where his birth is given as 1590. A Jesuit, Sempill taught as professor of mathematics at the Colegio Imperial de Madrid (Imperial College of Madrid), which employed teachers from all over Europe and made courses in geometry, geography, hydrography, and horology. He also served as procurator of the Royal Scots College in Madrid (now located in Salamanca). left Sempill's De Mathematicis disciplinis Libri duodecim (Antwerp, ex officina B. Moreti, 1635), dedicated to Philip IV of Spain, was a work that was read across Europe (his work was cited, for example, by the Jesuit Philippus Brietius in the Frenchman's own Parallela Geographie). Sempill's work was essentially a compilation and many pages consist of little but a list of names of writers in various scientific genres. Sempill also wrote Experientia Mathematice.

Parasomnias are dissociated sleep states which are partial arousals during the transitions between wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep, and their combinations.  Classification  The newest version of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD, 3rd. Ed.) uses State Dissociation as the paradigm for parasomnias. Unlike before, where wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were considered exclusive states, research has shown that combinations of these states are possible and thus, may result in unusual unstable states that could eventually manifest as parasomnias or as altered levels of awareness.Mahowald MW, Schenk CH. Dissociated states of wakefulness and sleep. In: Lydic R, Baghdoyan HA, editors. Handbook of behavioral state control: cellular and molecular mechanisms. Boca Raton: CRC Press; 1999. p. 143-58.Mahowald MW, Schenk CH. dissociated states of wakefulness and sleep. Neurology. 1992; 42(7 Suppl 6):44-51. Although, the previous definition is technically correct, it contains flaws. The consideration of the State Dissociation paradigm facilitates the understanding of the sleep disorder and provides a classification of 10 core categories. Non-rapid eye movement (NREM)-related parasomnias NREM parasomnias are arousal disorders that occur during stage 3 (or 4 by the R&K; standardization) of NREM sleep‚Äîalso known as slow wave sleep (SWS). They are caused by a physiological activation in which the patient's brain exits from SWS and is caught in between a sleeping and waking state. In particular, these disorders involve activation of the autonomic nervous system, motor system, or cognitive processes during sleep or sleep-wake transitions. Some NREM parasomnias (sleep-walking, night-terrors, and confusional arousal) are common during childhood but decrease in frequency with increasing age. They can be triggered in certain individuals, by alcohol, sleep deprivation, physical activity, emotional stress, depression, medications, or a fevered illness. These disorders of arousal can range from confusional arousals, somnambulism, to night terrors. Other specific disorders include sleepeating, sleep sex, teeth grinding, rhythmic movement disorder, restless legs syndrome, and somniloquy. = Differential diagnosis for NREM- related parasomnias = * Sleep-disordered breathing * REM-related parasomnias * Nocturnal seizures * Psychogenic dissociative disorders =Confusional arousals= Confusional arousal is a condition when an individual awakens from sleep and remains in a confused state. It is characterized by the individual's partial awakening and sitting up to look around. They usually remain in bed and then return to sleep. These episodes last anywhere from seconds to minutes and may not be reactive to stimuli. Confusional arousal is more common in children than in adults. It has a lifetime prevalence of 18.5% in children and a lifetime prevalence of 2.9-4.2% in adults.Ohayon MM, Priest RG, Zulley J, Smirne S. The place of confusional arousals in sleep and mental disorders: findings in a general population sample of 13,057 subjects. J Nerv Ment Dis. 2000;188(6):340-8.Ohayon MM, Guilleminault C, Priest RG. Night terrors, sleepwalking, and confusional arousals in the general population: their frequency and relationship to other sleep and mental disorders. J Clin Psychiatry. 1999;60(4):268-76. Infants and toddlers usually experience confusional arousals beginning with large amounts of movement and moaning, which can later progress to occasional thrashings or inconsolable crying. In rare cases, confusional arousals can cause injuries and drowsy driving accidents, thus it can also be considered dangerous. Another sleeping disorder may be present triggering these incomplete arousals. Sleep-related abnormal sexual behavior Sleep-related abnormal sexual behavior, Sleep sex, or sexsomnia, is a form of confusional arousal that may overlap with somnambulism. Thereby, a person will engage in sexual acts while still asleep. It can include such acts as masturbation, inappropriate fondling themselves or others, having sex with another person; and in more extreme cases, sexual assault. These behaviors are unconscious, occur frequently without dreaming, and bring along clinical, social, and legal implications. It has a lifetime prevalence of 7.1% and an annual prevalence of 2.7%. =Sleepwalking (somnambulism)= Sleepwalking has a prevalence of 1‚Äì17% in childhood, with the most frequent occurrences around the age of eleven to twelve. About 4% of adults experience somnambulism.Mahowald & Schenck. 1283. Normal sleep cycles include states varying from drowsiness all the way to deep sleep. Every time an individual sleeps, he or she goes through various sequences of non-REM and REM sleep. Anxiety and fatigue are often connected with sleepwalking. For adults, alcohol, sedatives, medications, medical conditions and mental disorders are all associated with sleepwalking. Sleep walking may involve sitting up and looking awake when the individual is actually asleep, and getting up and walking around, moving items or undressing themselves. They will also be confused when waking up or opening their eyes during sleep. Sleep walking can be associated with sleeptalking.ADAMinc.2012. =Sleep terrors (night terrors/ pavor nocturnus)= Sleep terror is the most disruptive arousal disorder since it may involve loud screams and panic; in extreme cases, it may result in bodily harm or property damage by running about or hitting walls. All attempts to console the individual are futile and may prolong or intensify the victim's confused state. Usually the victim experiences amnesia after the event but it may not be complete amnesia. Up to 3% of adults suffer from sleep terrors and exhibited behavior of this parasomnia can range from mild to extremely violent. This is very prevalent in those who suffer violent post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They typically occur in stage 3 sleep.Katugampola, M. (2005) Health & Human Development, Pearson Education. =Sleep-related eating disorder (SRED)= The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) classifies sleep-related eating disorder under sleepwalking, while ICSD classifies it as NREM-related parasomnia. It is conceptualized as a mixture of binge-eating behavior and arousal disorder. Thereby, preferentially high-caloric food is consumed in an uncontrolled manner. However, SRED should not be confused with nocturnal eating syndrome, which is characterized by an excessive consumption of food before or during sleep in full consciousness. Since sleep-related eating disorders are associated with other sleep disorders, successful treatment of the latter can reduce symptoms of this parasomnia. Rapid eye movement (REM)-related parasomnias =REM sleep behavior disorder= Unlike other parasomnias, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in which muscle atonia is absent is most common in older adults. This allows the individual to act out their dreams and may result in repeated injury‚Äîbruises, lacerations, and fractures‚Äîto themselves or others. Patients may take self-protection measures by tethering themselves to bed, using pillow barricades, or sleeping in an empty room on a mattress. Besides ensuring the sleep environment is a safe place, pharmacologic therapy using melatonin and clonazepam is also common as a treatment for RBD, even though might not eliminate all abnormal behaviours. Before starting a treatment with clonazepam, a screening for obstructive sleep apnea should performed. However, clonazepam needs to be manipulated carefully because of its significant side effects, i.e., morning confusion or memory impairment, mainly in patients with neurodegenerative disorders with dementia.Aurora, R., Zak, R., Maganti, R., Auerbach, S., Casey, K., Chowdhuri, S., . . . Morgenthaler, T. (2010). Best practice guide for the treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine : JCSM : Official Publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 6(1), 85-95. Demographically, 90% of RBD patients are males, and most are older than 50 years of age. However, this prevalence in males could be biased due to the fact that women tends to have a less violent type of RBD, which leads to lower reports at sleep centres and different clinical characteristics. While men might have more aggressive behaviour during dreaming, women have presented more disturbance in their sleep.Bj√∏rnar√•, Dietrichs, & Toft. (2013). REM sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease ‚Äì Is there a gender difference? Parkinsonism and Related Disorders, 19(1), 120-122.Bj√∏rnar√•, K., Dietrichs, E., & Toft, M. (2015). Longitudinal assessment of probable rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder in Parkinson's disease. European Journal of Neurology, 22(8), 1242-1244. RBD may be also influenced by a genetic compound, since primary relatives seem to have significantly more chance to develop RBD compared with non-relatives control group.Dauvilliers, B., Yves, Postuma, Livia, Ronald, Ferini-Strambi, Livia, Luigi, Arnulf, Livia, Isabelle, H√∂gl, Livia, Birgit, Manni, Livia, Raffaele, . . . Montplaisir, Livia, Jacques. (2013). Family history of idiopathic REM behavior disorder: A multicenter case-control study. Neurology, 80(24), 2233-2235. Typical clinical features of REM sleep behavior disorder are: * Male gender predilection * Mean age of onset 50‚Äì65 years (range 20‚Äì80 years) * Vocalisation, screaming, swearing that may be associated with dreams * Motor activity, simple or complex, that may result in injury to patient or bed- partner * Occurrence usually in latter half of sleep period (REM sleep) * May be associated with neurodegenerative disease Acute RBD occurs mostly as a result of a side-effect in prescribed medication‚Äîusually antidepressants. Furthermore, substance abuse or withdrawal can result in RBD. Chronic RBD is idiopathic, meaning of unknown origin, or associated with neurological disorders. There is a growing association of chronic RBD with neurodegenerative disorders‚ÄîParkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy (MSA), or dementia‚Äîas an early indicator of these conditions by as much as 10 years. RBD associated with neurological disorders is frequently related to abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein, and more than 80% of patients with idiopathic RBD might develop Lewy body disease (LBD).McCarter, S., & Howell, J. (2017). REM Sleep Behavior Disorder and Other Sleep Disturbances in Non- Alzheimer Dementias. Current Sleep Medicine Reports, 3(3), 193-203. Patients with narcolepsy are also more likely to develop RBD. The diagnosis is based on clinical history, including partner's account and needs to be confirmed by polysomnography (PSG), mainly for its accuracy in differentiating RBD from other sleep disorders, since there is a loss of REM atonia with excessive muscle tone. However, screening questionnaires, such as RBDSQ, are also very useful for diagnosing RBD. =Recurrent isolated sleep paralysis= Recurrent isolated sleep paralysis is an inability to perform voluntary movements at sleep onset, or upon waking from sleep. Although the affected individual is conscious and recall is present, the person is not able to speak or move. However, respiration remains unimpaired. The episodes last seconds to minutes and diminish spontaneously. The lifetime prevalence is 7%. Sleep paralysis is associated with sleep-related hallucinations. Predisposing factors for the development of recurrent isolated sleep paralysis are sleep deprivation, an irregular sleep-wake cycle, e.g. caused by shift work, or stress. A possible cause could be the prolongation of REM sleep muscle atonia upon awakening. = Nightmare disorder = Nightmares are like dreams primarily associated with REM sleep. Nightmare disorder is defined as recurrent nightmares associated with awakening dysphoria that impairs sleep or daytime functioning. It is rare in children, however persists until adulthood. About 2/3 of the adult population report experiencing nightmares at least once in their life. =Catathrenia= Before the ICSD-3, Catathrenia was classified as a rapid- eye-movement sleep parasomnia, but is now classified as sleep-related breathing disorder. It consists of breath holding and expiratory groaning during sleep, is distinct from both somniloquy and obstructive sleep apnea. The sound is produced during exhalation as opposed to snoring which occurs during inhalation. It is usually not noticed by the person producing the sound but can be extremely disturbing to sleep partners, although once aware of it, sufferers tend to be woken up by their own groaning as well. Bed partners generally report hearing the person take a deep breath, hold it, then slowly exhale; often with a high-pitched squeak or groaning sound. = Sleep-Related Painful Erections = Painful erections appear only during the sleep. This condition is present during the REM sleep. Sexual activity doesn't produce any pain.Silber, M. H., St. Louis, E. K., & Boeve, B. F. (2017). Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Parasomnias. In Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine (p. 993-1001.e6). https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-24288-2.00103-3 There isn't any lesion or physical damage but an hypertonia of the pelvic floor could be one cause. It affects men of all ages but especially from the middle- age.Vreugdenhil, S., Weidenaar, A. C., de Jong, I. J., & van Driel, M. F. (2018). Sleep-Related Painful Erections: A Meta-Analysis on the Pathophysiology and Risks and Benefits of Medical Treatments. The Journal of Sexual Medicine, 15(1), 5‚Äë19. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsxm.2017.11.006 Some pharmacologic treatment as propranolol, clozapine, clonazepam, baclofen and various antidepressants, seems to be effective.  Other parasomnias  =Exploding head syndrome= = Sleep-related hallucinations = Sleep- related hallucinations are brief episodes of dream-like imagery that can be of any sensory modality, i.e., auditory, visual, or tactile. They are differentiated between hypnagogic hallucination, that occur at sleep onset, and hypnapompic hallucinations, which occur at the transition of sleep to awakening. Although normal individuals have reported nocturnal hallucinations, they are more frequent in comorbidity with other sleep disorders, e.g. narcolepsy. = Sleep enuresis = = Parasomnias due to medical disorder = = Parasomnias due to medication or substance = = Parasomnia, unspecific =  Isolated symptom/normal variant  = Sleep talking (somniloquy) = According to ICSD-3 it is not defined a disorder in particular. It is rather an isolated symptom or normal variant and ranges from isolated speech to full conversations without recall. With a lifetime prevalence of 69% it is considered fairly common. Sleep talking is associated with REM-related parasomnias as well as with disorders or arousal. It occurs in all sleep states. Until now, there is no specific treatment for sleeptalking available.  Diagnosis  Parasomnias are most commonly diagnosed by means of questionnaires. These questionnaires include a detailed analyses of the clinical history and contain questions to: # Rule out sleep deprivation # Rule out effects of intoxication or withdrawal # Rule out sleep disorders causing sleep instability # Rule out medical disorders or treatments associated with sleep instability # Confirm presence of NREM parasomnias in other family members and during the patient's childhood # Determine the timing of the events # Determine the morphology of the events. Furthermore, a sleep diary is helpful to exclude that sleep deprivation could be a precipitating factor. An additional tool could be the partner's log of the events. The following questions should therefore be considered: # Do you or your bed partner believe that you move your arms, legs, or body too much, or have unusual behaviors during sleep? # Do you move while dreaming, as if you are simultaneously attempting to carry out the dream? l Have you ever hurt yourself or your bed partner during sleep? # Do you sleepwalk or have sleep terrors with loud screaming? # Do your legs feel restless or begin to twitch a lot or jump around when you are drowsy or sleepy, either at bedtime or during the day? # Do you eat food or drink fluids without full awareness during the night? Do you wake up in the morning feeling bloated and with no desire to eat breakfast? In potentially harmful or disturbing cases a specialist in sleep disorders should be approached. Video polysomnographic documentation is necessary only in REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), since it is an essential diagnostic criteria in the ICSD to demonstrate the absence of muscle atonia and to exclude comorbid sleep disorders. For most of the other parasomnias, polysomnographic monitoring is a costly, but still supportive tool in the clinical diagnosis. The use of actigraphy can be promising in the diagnostical assessment of NREM-related parasomnias, for example to rule out sleep deprivation or other sleep disorders, like circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorder which often develops among shift workers. However, there is currently no generally accepted standardized technique available of identifying and quantifying periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) that distinguishes movements resulting from parasomnias, nocturnal seizures, and other dyskinesias. Eventually, using actigraphy for parasomnias in general is disputed.  Treatment  Parasomnias can be considered as potentially harmful to oneself as well as to bed partners, and are associated with other disorders. Children with parasomnias do not undergo medical intervention, because they tend to recover the NREM-related disorder with the process of growth. In those cases, the parents receive education on sleep hygiene to reduce and eventually eliminate precipitating factors. In adults psychoeducation about a proper sleep hygiene can reduce the risk to develop parasomnia. Case studies have shown that pharmacological interventions can improve symptoms of parasomnia, however mostly they are accompanied by side- effects. Behavioral treatments, i.e., relaxation therapy, biofeedback, hypnosis, and stress reduction, may also be helpful, but are not considered as universally effective.  Prognosis  NREM-related parasomnias which are common in childhood show a good prognosis, since severity decreases with age, the symptoms tend to resolve during puberty. Adults suffering from NREM- related parasomnias, however, are faced with a stronger persistence of the symptoms, therefore, full remission is quite unlikely and is also associated with violent complications, including homicide. The variant sleep-related eating disorders is chronic, without remission, but treatable. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) can mostly be handled well with the use of melatonin or clonazepam. However, there is high comorbidity with neurodegenerative disorders, that is in up to 93% of cases. The underlying psychopathology of nightmare disorder complicates a clear prognosis. The prognosis for other parasomnias seems promising. While exploding head syndrome usually resolves spontaneously, the symptoms for sleep-related hallucinations tend to diminish over time.

PADRES effectively ceased to function in 1989, after accomplishing its primary objectives. Origin In 1969, Father Ralph Ruiz of San Antonio, Texas, began meeting informally with other Mexican American priests in the area.

David Duran of Fresno, who later became the first chaplain of the United Farm Workers, and Fr. Virgil Elizondo, author of several works on Our Lady of Guadalupe. While Texan priests were in the majority, there was also clergy from Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington, and the Washington, D.C., and a few Protestant ministers. Los Angeles priests were conspicuously absent, not having been invited due to the Archdiocese's reputation for repressing progressive priests. At the conference, the topics were much the same as at the informal meetings between Ruiz and his colleagues, but were undertaken in a much more formal manner. The convened priests chose the name \\"PADRES\\" for the organization, elected Fr. Ruiz provisional chairman, and set the date for a national congress for February of the following year. They agreed to hold it in Arizona, which was deemed \\"neutral ground\\". Following the conference, Fr. Ruiz set about making arrangements for the national congress. He personally wrote every Mexican-American priest and also sent invitations to white clergy who served predominantly Mexican American parishes. He also wrote a letter to San Antonio Archbishop Francis James Furey to inform him of the congress, and another to the National Council of Catholic Bishops (NCCB), now called the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which put forth a set of resolutions and included a fact sheet highlighting PADRES' concerns. The resolutions demanded: *the appointment of Mexican-American bishops *the appointment of Spanish-speaking priests as pastors in Spanish-speaking communities *attention to the material needs of the poor and working classes, especially through the establishment of Catholic schools *a Mexican-American unit of the National Liturgical Commission to adapt the liturgy to Mexican American culture *support for the grape boycott PADRES sought an official liaison with the NCCB, but were initially denied. After being pressured, however, the NCCB agreed to set up an \\"informal liaison committee\\" of five bishops: Furey, Manning of Los Angeles, Green of Tucson, Medeiros of Brownsville, and Buswell of Pueblo. The committee was ratified in December 1969. First national congress The first national congress was held from February 2‚Äì6, 1970 in Tucson. There were more than 200 people in attendance, many of them uninvited. The largest group of crashers was a progressive group of priests, nuns, and laity from Northern California, most of whom were White American. Fr. Ruiz and the other hosts accommodated the other factions as best they could, but the radicals demanded an organization open to laity, which they wanted to call PUEBLOS. To head off the usurpment of the organization, Ruiz and Fr. Edmundo Rodriguez spent the night following the first day of deliberations drafting a constitution that defined a priest's organization. The next morning, Fr. Ruiz addressed the people assembled. He told the people wishing to form an organization open to laity that they were welcome to do so, and to use the facilities, but that the organization of Chicano priests was meeting in the next room. As he proceeded to the next room, he was followed by the Mexican American priests. The result of the friction was the freezing out of the Anglo priests who wanted to help further the advancement of Mexican Americans. The reasons for the exclusion were several: the laity were excluded because Ruiz and other founders knew that the opinions of priests carried much more weight with the hierarchy than those of the parishioners, and did not want their influence diluted. Sympathetic white priests were allowed to be dues-paying members, but were not permitted to vote in organizational proceedings. This was due to the paternalism the Catholic Church in the United States had shown toward the Mexican American population since the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the result of which was the denial of positions of authority to Mexican Americans. PADRES feared having their leadership co-opted and so limited their membership for this reason as well. The exclusion had several effects. For one, some Mexican American priests were alienated by the exclusion of the white priests, as were some of the white priests themselves. The Mexican American laity, religious brothers, and deacons, were also disappointed that they could not join the organization. The issue continued to fester, and motions were introduced yearly to expand membership. Slowly, more groups were included into PADRES, beginning with Mexican American deacons in 1972, Puerto Ricans in 1974, and finally all brothers, deacons, and priests in 1981. On the other hand, restricting membership to Chicano priests allowed the group a greater sense of cohesion while simultaneously assuring that the leadership of the organization would remain in their hands. Many white priests understood this and joined as non-voting members. Activities In April 1970, PADRES was incorporated in Washington, D.C. In 1971, the group was organized into seven regional chapters, each with its own director who was under the national executive director. At the 1971 national conference in Los Angeles, Fr. Alberto Carrillo delivered an address that articulated a social theory of discrimination within the Church. It analyzed the Church within the framework of majority-minority relations, and concluded that: # The majority assumes the minority incapable of policymaking and excludes members of that minority from the policymaking process. As a result, the majority makes policy affecting the minority. # The majority \\"blames the victim\\" for the problems of the minority # The majority acts as if there is no problem until it affects the majority itself, and finally, # The solution to the problem resides in the hands of the majority. This analysis provided PADRES with an intellectual basis for their challenge against the Church, and held the Church to the same standards as secular organizations in regards to issues of social and political inclusion. At the conference, PADRES members identified three goals: The eradication of lack of education, an increase in the religious consciousness, and improvement of the social conditions of Mexican Americans.

The game is a spin-off from the Dragon Quest series, and was first released in Japan in July 2007, and worldwide the following year. Gameplay =Battle system= Dragon Quest Swords utilizes an on rails first person battle system. However, instead of a gun, Dragon Quest Swords uses the functions of the Wii Remote as a sword and a shield. The direction of a sword slash or thrust is dependent on the direction the player sways the Wii Remote. The player can also set the focal point for their sword attacks by pointing with the Wii Remote and pushing A. While holding down the B button, the Wii Remote cursor is replaced by a shield. The shield can block any enemy attack if the player points it at the point of impact, which is indicated by red, blue, or yellow markings. Attacks with blue markings can also be repelled by striking them with the sword, which knocks them back at the enemy. If properly timed, the ricocheted attack will damage the enemy; if the timing is slightly off, the attack will miss the enemy, possibly destroying their cover instead. A special attack, called a master stroke, can be used once the special attack gauge is filled. The gauge is filled by hitting enemies, hitting projectiles back at them, or blocking attacks. When the player initiates a master stroke, they must perform a brief quick time event in which they mimic the motions of the stroke. If the player fails the quick time event, the master stroke is cancelled and the special attack gauge drops down to 90%. Master strokes are learned by tempering swords and getting new swords, while buddy strokes are obtained from the player's current partner. A buddy stroke is a master stroke that can only be performed once that ally has gotten to a certain level, along with being with the hero. There is no game over in Dragon Quest Swords. Upon defeat, the player character is returned to town and loses half their money and any newly acquired items, but retains all the experience points they gained. The player can also return to town by choice if they are not in battle, in which case they keep all their money and items as well as the experience points. To temper a sword, the player requires a large sum of money and a specific set of rare materials that can be found in the game's stages. Only the hero's allies (Anlace, Fleurette and Claymore) can cast magic and only one of them can accompany the hero at a time. The player can set the allies' AI to one of four settings, and can have them cast a specific spell at any time by bringing up the menu. As in most on rails games, monsters always appear in the same order, in the same place, and players are scored according to their overall accuracy and chains of successful hits. Unlike most on rails games, however, in most stages the player does not advance automatically, allowing them to set their own pace. Players can increase their character's attack strength and endurance by the usual RPG methods of defeating enemies for experience points and equipping better weapons and armor. =Stages= There are ten specific areas in this game. The eight story mode areas, the second half of the eighth area, and the Olde Reflectory. After finishing story mode, a set of warps are unlocked in the Olde Reflectory. They lead to many bosses that were not in the story mode, along with stronger versions of some story mode bosses. =Minigames= Dragon Quest Swords includes several minigames. They can be played alone, or with up to three friends, at Stiletto's shop in town. There are 3 dart games, in which the player uses the shield to catch darts, with different areas of the shield being worth different numbers of points. There are 3 games where the object is to slay all the slimes as fast as possible. Each of the six games awards different prizes, based on points. The prize categories are for B, A, S, and X rank, with X being the highest. There is also a tombola minigame at the item shop. Story The game is set in the kingdom of Avalonia. Five years have passed since the defeat of Xiphos, the Death Bringer. Prince Anlace is concerned by the recent behavior of the queen; she insists upon wearing a mask at all times and, claiming to be unwell, refuses to see anyone, including her son. When she secretly heads off to the Galantyne Glades, Anlace asks Claymore, one of the warriors who defeated Xiphos, to help him follow her. Claymore refuses for fear of offending the queen, but allows his son, who has just turned sixteen, to go in his stead. Claymore's son (the player character) and Anlace observe the queen leave a hut deep in the Glades. The hut's resident, Fleurette, tells them the queen came looking for her brother Aruval, another of the warriors who defeated Xiphos. Following Xiphos's defeat, Aruval contracted a strange malady and Fleurette, who had been training to be a nun, left for a life of seclusion so she could help him. Her magic could not cure Aruval, and he left without saying where he was going. Fleurette belatedly remembers she saw the mask the Queen wears while lost in Arondight Heights as a child. Intuiting that the queen knows Aruval's whereabouts, she goes to the castle to confront her, but is denied an audience. She instead asks the player character to help her investigate Arondight Heights. There she finds the carving she saw as a child on a mountainside. Though she did not know its meaning then, she now recognizes that it depicts Xiphos wearing the mask. She concludes that the mask is possessing the Queen. They head back to town to warn the people, but while there reports come in of a monster in the Secace Seacove. Claymore and his son volunteer to deal with it. They defeat the monster, but Fleurette arrives and implores them not to kill it. She says that the monster is Aruval. She tries convincing Aruval to return home, but he has little control of himself and flees into the water. The group returns and learns that the Queen has entered the Tower of Mirrors. They pursue her to the top, where they find her activating a portal in a mirror. The hero cuts her mask in two. However, this actually releases Xiphos's soul, which the queen had been containing with the mask ever since she realized Xiphos was taking control of her. Fleurette realizes that the carving actually depicts a group of heroes forcing the mask onto Xiphos's face. Xiphos explains that the moment before his defeat five years ago, he separated his soul from his body and implanted it within the heroes who defeated him. He leaves the queen's body and raises a castle surrounded by a sea of lava to be his new residence. Lacking a means of reaching Xiphos, the heroes decide to focus on restoring the mask. Dao, Claymore's old teacher, says the mask was made in the Mirror World, which can be reached through the Tower of Mirrors. They enter the Mirror World and meet its guardian, Draug. Draug not only repairs the mask, but gives the player character the Rednusadner, a powerful sword that can open the way to Xiphos's castle. Dao teaches him the Figure of Fate, a technique of the Rednusadner which he uses to open a path in the sea of lava. The party makes their way through the sea of lava and the castle to Xiphos. Xiphos has captured Aruval and draws out the part of his soul he had implanted in him. This restores Aruval to normal and gives Xiphos physical form. The party attacks Xiphos and subdues him long enough to place the mask on him. It turns Xiphos into a statue, which the player character shatters with a blow from the Rednusadner. Xiphos's castle starts to crumble. During the party's escape, the hero accidentally drops the mask into the sea of lava. Back in Avalonia, a great party is held in the hero's honor. He makes his way to a balcony and raises the Rednusadner to the sky, causing all the citizens to cheer. Development Originally planned to be a launch game for the Wii, Dragon Quest Swords was released on July 12, 2007 in Japan. The game was released in North America on February 19, 2008. Under the spotlight of E3 2006 and in an unprecedented show of software support for a Nintendo console, Square Enix revealed that Dragon Quest Swords and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers would be exclusive Wii titles. In a company press release, executive producer Yuu Miyake stated: The Dragon Quest Swords development team includes many of the original designers of Enix's flagship series. Creator Yuji Horii was one of the first game designers Nintendo president Satoru Iwata approached with the prototype Revolution controller. Horii contributed a video interview to Nintendo's Tokyo Game Show 2005 Revolution press conference. In it, he talked about making games accessible to a greater market, and cutting to the essence of \\"fun.\\" When asked about Nintendo's Wii Remote, Horii stated \\"I agree that many interesting games can be created using this controller, but I still think that Nintendo would probably make the best games.\\" According to video game website IGN, Square Enix representatives have branded Dragon Quest Swords a sequel to Kenshin Dragon Quest, a motion-activated plug-and-play TV game. In a detailed preview of Dragon Quest Swords, IGN speculated that the game mechanics will be similar to those featured in Kenshin. A short teaser video of a first-person perspective battle sequence appeared to confirm IGN's speculation as the onscreen protagonist mimicked the sword fighting antics of the Revolution Remote wielder. Furthermore, Square Enix stated in a press release that the game \\"is being developed with every aspect of the unique Wii hardware in mind.\\" Square-Enix would later announce extra features for the North American version, such as a playback mode and four hidden bosses. The localization follows the style of other recent releases in the Dragon Quest series from Square Enix. Notably, the same team responsible for the English translation of Dragon Quest VIII, Plus Alpha Translations, is listed among the translators in the ending staff roll. =Music= A soundtrack was released on August 22, 2007, with music composed and arranged by Manami Matsumae. Series regular Koichi Sugiyama did not contribute to the game, however some of his previous themes were re-arranged by Matsumae. For this, Sugiyama received a co-composing credit with Matsumae in the staff roll. Reception The game sold 305,000 units in Japan in its first week according to Media Create. It has sold 490,000 units in Japan and 110,000 units in North America as of August 8, 2008. Famitsu gave the game a score of 33/40 (8, 8, 8, 9). The game currently has a Metacritic score of 65 out of 100 based on 43 reviews.

The United States Congress allocated additional funds to the Border Patrol and other agencies. By 1997, the budget of the Immigration and Naturalization Service had doubled to 800 million dollars, the number of Border Patrol agents had nearly doubled, the amount of fencing or other barriers more than doubled, and the number of underground sensors nearly tripled. The merits of Operation Gatekeeper were debated extensively, including during Congressional hearings. The Department of Justice, the INS, and the Border Patrol maintained that Operation Gatekeeper was a success. Some Congressmen and others sharply criticized the program and declared it a failure.Operation Gatekeeper: An Investigation Into Allegations of Fraud and Misconduct Phases The first phase of Gatekeeper focused on the 5 5/8 westernmost miles of the border, extending from the Pacific Ocean to the San Ysidro Port of Entry near San Diego. U.S. migration routes immediately shifted eastward, and the use of professional human smugglers known as coyotes or polleros increased. In May 1995, the Border Patrol initiated Operation Disruption to target human smugglers, and also established new checkpoints on interior highways. Phase two, although not formally part of Gatekeeper, was launched in October 1995. It consisted of the appointment of Alan Bersin as the Attorney General's Special Representative on Southwest Border Issues and the establishment of the first Immigration Court at the actual boundary, inside the San Ysidro Port of Entry. The court expedited hearings and subsequent deportations of undocumented immigrants apprehended attempting to enter the U.S. with false documents or through false representation. Phase two also introduced IDENT, an automated biometric identification system, to facilitate identification of repeat offenders and \\"criminal aliens\\", i.e., illegal immigrants with criminal records or active warrants for their arrest. The Border Patrol also intensified relations with local law enforcement agencies to counter the flow of migrants through the Otay Mountains. Allegations of NAFTA enforcement Academic Noam Chomsky has said that Operation Gatekeeper was a \\"militarization of the U.S.-Mexican border\\" and alleges it was because North American Free Trade Agreement would have increased illegal immigration into the United States; therefore, Gatekeeper was a precaution to stop future illegal immigration.The Unipolar Moment and the Obama Era, Noam Chomsky.

Broadly, a chapter is an organization of members of the fraternity attached to an institution or geographic locationLambda Chi Alpha Fraternity, Constitution and Statutory Code, 39th Edition (2006‚Äì2008), Article V. Section 1. which has received a charter authorizing it to operate as the local unit of Lambda Chi Alpha. A colony is a local group which is being organized or reorganized and has not yet met the standards for a charter. Most newly issued charters go to colonies established by the General Fraternity, although the majority of charters were issued to petitioning local societies. In the early days of the fraternity, founder Warren A. Cole issued charters to so-called picked delegations, groups of correspondents who were interested in forming a fraternity chapter but who had not yet organized themselves. Additionally, in 1939, Lambda Chi Alpha merged with Theta Kappa Nu and absorbed 28 active chapters, plus seven on campuses where Lambda Chi Alpha was already represented. Naming Lambda Chi Alpha chapters are known as subordinate Zetas, or simply Zetas. Thus, the Alpha chapter at Boston is referred to as Alpha Zeta. Zetas are identified by Greek letters in a unique \\"scrambled alphabet\\" naming scheme. At the fraternity's inception, founder Warren A. Cole assigned Greek letters to petitioning groups that had not yet been chartered. Predictably, not all of these groups were chartered. As a result, the first seven chapters were designated Œë, Œì, Œï, Œñ, Œô, Œõ, and Œí, in that order. John E. Mason created a twenty-four word mnemonic device with words representing each Greek letter once‚Äî the first seven words were in the order that the chapters were already named. :A good energetic Zeta is Lambda's boast; ‚ÄòStrength from Delta Pi‚Äô, our motto, to each through union; excellent character only, knowing no retreating steps. Therefore, the chapters are named in the order: Œë, Œì, Œï, Œñ, Œô, Œõ, Œí, Œ£, Œ¶, Œî, Œ†, Œü, Œú, Œ§, Œó, Œò, Œ•, Œû, Œß, Œ©, Œö, Œù, Œ°, Œ®. After the twenty-fourth chapter, the sequence was continued with a prefix and hyphen (Œë-Œë, Œë-Œì, Œë-Œï, ... Œì-Œë, Œì-Œì, Œì-Œï, ... Œï-A, etc.) When Theta Kappa Nu merged with Lambda Chi Alpha in 1939, former Theta Kappa Nu chapters were assigned chapter designations prefixed with Œò, Œö, or Œù. The second letter of their chapter name was assigned in the order mentioned above and applied to the chapters in order of their precedence in Theta Kappa Nu; e.g., Theta Kappa Nu's Alpha chapter at Howard College (now Samford University) became Theta Alpha Zeta. On twenty-one campuses, chapters of both Lambda Chi Alpha and Theta Kappa Nu existed.

The challenge is to calculate the value w=2^{2^t} \\\\pmod n where t is a 14-digit (or 47-bit) integer, namely 79685186856218, and n is a 616 digit (or 2048 bit) integer which is the product of two large primes (which are not given). The value of w can then be used to decrypt the ciphertext z, another 616 digit integer. The plaintext provides the concealed information about the factorisation of n, allowing the solution to be easily verified. The idea behind the challenge is that the only known way to find the value of w without knowing the factorisation of n is by t successive squarings. The value of t was chosen to make this brute force calculation take about 35 years using 1999 chip speeds as a starting point and taking into account Moore's law. Rivest notes that \\"just as a failure of Moore's Law could make the puzzle harder than intended, a breakthrough in the art of factoring would make the puzzle easier than intended.\\" The challenge was set at (and takes its name from) the 35th anniversary celebrations of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, now part of MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

He is best known for having traded Jewish lives for money during the Holocaust. SS background Becher was born to a wealthy family. He testified during the Nuremberg Trials that he had joined the SS because from 1932 he had been actively engaged in horseback riding, and in 1934, his instructor had advised him to enter the SS cavalry regiment (the Reiter-SS). Hannah Arendt suggests that the only reason Becher stressed this story was that the Nuremberg Tribunal had excluded the Reiter-SS from its list of criminal organizations. Becher served as an SS Major in Poland and Russia, as part of the SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde, which perfected the techniques for killing Jews. He was appointed Commissar of all German concentration camps, and Chief of the Economic Department of the SS Command in Hungary, by Heinrich Himmler. The \\"Economic Department\\" was tasked with extracting maximal economic value from Jews, which included confiscating goods and property, and selling or using belongings and body parts, including shorn hair and gold extracted from teeth.Hecht, Ben. Perfidy, Milah Press, 1999, pp. 67-68. In Hungary Becher became the main buyer of horses for the SS and, according to his own testimony, was sent to Hungary in March 1944, when Germany invaded that country, to buy 20,000 horses. Arendt posited that this story is unlikely to be true, because as soon as he arrived in Budapest, he began to engage in a series of negotiations with the heads of several large Jewish business concerns.Arendt, p. 142. His later actions showed that his goal was rather to extort as much wealth as possible from Hungary's Jews on behalf of Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS. From 1944-45, he collected large sums of money, jewellery, and precious metals, worth an estimated 8,600,000 Swiss francs, from Hungarian Jews, a portion of which travelled with him in six large suitcases, in what became known as the \\"Becher Deposit\\".Zweig, Ronald W.

The court found that Kastner collaborated with the Nazis' extermination of the Jews in Hungary, and by saving the war criminal Kurt Becher from its penalty. Kastner was subsequently assassinated in Israel in March 1957. The Supreme Court of Israel overturned the judgment against Kastner in 1958, except for the section exonerating Becher, whose status as a war criminal was determined in a 35 page decision, the Supreme Court ruled that Kastner's affidavit was perjurious, as Kastner had known of Becher's activities during the war.\\"Kastner's conviction in mistestifying for a war criminal- part A\\", Supreme court of Israel's verdict at Daat website, Hebrew\\"Kastner's conviction in mistestifying for a war criminal- part B\\", Supreme court of Israel's verdict at Daat website, Hebrew The Becher Deposit was eventually sold for $55,000, far less than its estimated value.

He played baseball for the Louisville Cardinals from to . He was drafted in the 12th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft by the Colorado Rockies after his junior season at Louisville. After spending his first professional season with the Portland Rockies of the Northwest League, the right-hander moved up the organizational ladder, pitching for the Asheville Tourists in the South Atlantic League in , Salem in the Carolina League in , and California League's Visalia Oaks before jumping to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers in where he was 4‚Äì3 with a 3.03 ERA.

He completed the 2005 season in Tacoma and pitched in seven spring training games with the big league squad in Arizona before opening back in Tacoma. His spring training performance and 4‚Äì0 record and 1.38 ERA as the Rainiers' closer caught the eye of Mariners manager Mike Hargrove. Green made it to the big leagues when the Seattle Mariners called him up on April 29, 2006, to replace reliever Julio Mateo. When Mateo was activated on May 20, it was thought that Green would return to Triple-A Tacoma, but the Mariners opted to instead send down pitcher Emiliano Fruto.

She acted against the wishes of the local tenant farmer landlords and Catholic priests and was accused of witchcraft.https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/irish- lives-1.664705 Childhood Biddy Early was born on Faha Ridge, County Clare, to John Thomas Connors, a poor farmer, and his wife Ellen (n√©e Early). Biddy was baptised Bridget Ellen Connors but later adopted the Early name. As a child, she wore clothes that her mother made by weaving fibres from the flax that was grown nearby. She spent most of her time alone and was said to \\"talk to the fairies\\". She was good humoured and showed a keen intellect but, like most people of her time, she did not learn to read or write. With her family and friends she spoke Irish, but she had some knowledge of English. Ellen Connors (n√©e Early) was well known for her exceptional herbal cures and taught her daughter many of her recipes. These recipes were regarded as family secrets, as was common for the time. When Biddy was 16 years old, her mother died of malnutrition, leaving her in charge of the household. Just six months after her mother's death, her father died of typhus. Unable to pay the rent, she left her childhood home. Adult life When Biddy was 18, she began working for a landlord in Carheen near Limerick, but she was often taunted for her aloof behaviour. She left after a short time and went to live in the local poorhouse, where she was treated even more poorly. During this period, she would often walk into Gurteenreagh on market days, and it was there that she met her first husband, Pat Malley of Feakle. The couple faced a number of obstacles: Pat was twice Biddy's age and already had a son and Biddy had no dowry to offer. However, they wed. After their marriage, Biddy gave birth to a son, Paddy, her only child. The family lived in a three-room cottage in Feakle, and this is where Biddy began to earn a reputation for her cures. Biddy never requested money for her services, but allowed her clients to decide how to compensate her. Whiskey and poit√≠n were common trade items in those days, so her house was frequently stocked with an abundance of alcohol and eventually became known as a place where people could go to drink and play cards. Biddy was widowed at age 25. She later married her stepson, John Malley, shortly after Pat's death. During this marriage, her fame was increasing but her family life was frequently disrupted by large numbers of people coming and going at various times of the day and night. Her son, Paddy, left home some years after her marriage to John and never returned. John Malley died in 1840 from a liver ailment and Biddy was a widow again at 42. Her third marriage was to a man named Tom Flannery, who was younger than she was. Tom was a labourer and native of Finley, Quin, County Clare. The couple moved into a two-room cottage on Dromore Hill in Kilbarron. It was situated over a lake, which came to be known as Biddy Early's Lake. Her fame peaked during this period and her house became even busier and more crowded. Work and fame When people didn't get the help they wanted from the priests or doctors, or if they couldn't afford to see a doctor, they would turn to Biddy. Her cures did not only consist of applying herbs to a wound or feeding a recipe to the sick. She was insightful and intuitive, which helped her to recognise and understand people's needs and choose appropriate yet creative measures to address them. Biddy was also called upon occasionally to treat animals. During her time, the death of an animal could lead to an inability to complete required tasks and cause a farm to fail. This was important because it could, in turn, lead to eviction and poverty and, in extreme cases, loss of human life. For the same reasons, farmers also asked Biddy to help with other problems related to daily life, such as restoring a spring well or fixing a problem with the farm's butter production. At some point Biddy acquired a bottle that became as famous as she was. She would frequently look into the bottle, which contained some sort of dark liquid, when considering possible cures for her visitors. She took the bottle everywhere, and it was even with her when she died. Her cures are the main reason she became well-known, but her strong personality was also an important factor. According to one biographer, \\"In many ways, what Biddy is purported to have done is what an oppressed peasantry would themselves wish to have done if they had dared\\",Lenihan, Edmund. In Search of Biddy Early. The Mercier Press. Cork (1987). because she was independent and refused to be \\"browbeaten by [the priests' and landlord's] authoritarian ways\\". Conflicts Although the Catholic Church, which held authority over the lives of many people at the time, did not approve of Biddy's activities, she encouraged people to listen to its priests. The priests openly disapproved of her and discouraged people from visiting, yet some secretly continued to visit. People believed she was good, and some felt the real reason the priests didn't like her was that they \\"thought if Biddy wasn't [practising medicine] the people'd be going with five shillings an' ten shillings to themselves\\". This notion is repeated frequently in interviews with those who had personal knowledge of Biddy. Another contributing factor must have been the folklore and mysticism that surrounded her. While Biddy was from a class of small tenant farmers, the priests were usually from more comfortable backgrounds and placed emphasis on education, so they were \\"only too anxious to leave behind them the half-lit world of peasant lore and herbal medicine\\". In 1865 Biddy was accused of witchcraft under the Witchcraft Act 1586 and was brought before a court in Ennis. This would have been unusual in the 1860s. The few who agreed to testify against her later backed out. She was released for lack of sufficient evidence. Many local people supported her. Old age and death In 1868, Tom Flannery died, leaving Biddy widowed for the third time at age 70. In 1869, she was married for the fourth and final time to Thomas Meaney, a man in his 30s, in exchange for a cure. They lived together in her cottage in Kilbarron until he died, within a year of their marriage, from over-consumption of alcohol. Biddy died in poverty in 1874.Biddy Early's death is reported in the Irish American Weekly as having occurred on 1 June 1872. Ref: Irish American Weekly, New York City, 29 June 1872, page 3 A priest was present at her death, and her friend and neighbour, Pat Loughnane, arranged for her burial in Feakle Graveyard in County Clare. Legacy The Biddy Early Brewery, Inagh. The last generation of people who had personal contact with Biddy ended in the 1950s. The stories that persist today originated in the strong oral tradition in the West of Ireland. Later, Lady Gregory compiled a valuable collection of stories 20 years after Biddy's death, and Meda Ryan and Edmund Lenihan wrote books that they based on interviews with many people whose parents or grandparents had personal contact with Biddy.

It is named for Kentucky Governor Simeon S. Willis. The bridge was planned, at one point, to cross at 45th St. and connect to a proposed Ashland bypass. The Willis bridge, however, was built one block from the existing Ben Williamson Memorial Bridge and generally carries only northbound (Ohio-bound) traffic. Southbound traffic (toward Kentucky), which is normally carried on the Williamson Bridge, has been diverted to the Willis bridge four times since its opening in 1985. In 1989, 2007 and 2018, the Williamson bridge was closed for renovations and painting with traffic diverted to the Willis Bridge. The Williamson bridge was also closed briefly and traffic again diverted to the Willis Bridge in the summer of 2013 after a tractor-trailer ran into the tower on the Ohio side, causing structural damage to the bridge. The shorter Ohio portion of the bridge officially carries part of Ohio State Route 652 but is not signed as such.

Through his independent label/production office, Craig 'N Company, he has produced over 50 albums. He is also the executive producer of the Celebrate Series, Jewish-themed compilation albums with titles like Celebrate Hip Hop and Celebrate Passover. Taubman's career initially launched with his popularity as a children's recording artist in the early 1990s, during which he was prominently seen on the Disney Channel performing songs like \\"You Need a Haircut, You Really Need a Haircut\\" and concerts like \\"Rock'n Toontown\\" at Disneyland. In recent years, he has branched out into recording and performing more adult-oriented music, most of it Jewish in nature, although he continues to record and perform for children. Through Craig 'N Co., Taubman regularly produces and performs at concert events across the country, most notably his regular Friday Night Live Shabbat evening services at Sinai Temple (Los Angeles, California), the Let My People Sing Passover Festival, and the Big Tent Event. In February 2013, Taubman bought the former Welsh Presbyterian Church on Valencia Street in downtown Los Angeles, which from 1909 to 1925 was the home of Sinai Temple and which was named a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1977, and converted the building into \\"a multi-faith cultural arts center and house of worship\\" called the Pico Union Project.http://www.picounionproject.org/ Discography =Solo Albums= * Dreidel I Shall Play - Samuel Goldfarb Jewish American Songster * Here and There 2015 * How Good - 2010 * Holy Ground - 2009 * Inscribed - 2005 * One Shabbat Morning - 2002 * The Best of the Rest - 2001 * Friday Night Live - 1999 * Kol Tikvah - 1997 * My Newish Jewish Discovery - 1997 * Imaginit - 1996 * Voice of the Spirit - 1996 * My Jewish Discovery - 1995 * Heaven and Earth - 1993 * Rock 'N Toontown - 1993 * Rockin' Together - 1992 * Journey - 1991 * Craig 'N Company - 1989 * Encore - 1989 * Pennies for Your Thoughts - 1988 * Yad B'Yad: Together - 1988 * Karen and Craig Makin' Music - 1987 * Rhythm and Rhyme - 1986 * Yad B'Yad: Hand 'N Hand - 1986 * Moment to Moment - 1985 * Beginnings - 1982 * We Were as Dreamers - 1981 * Zany Brainy =Compilations= * Meditations of my Heart - 2009 * Sweet Sounds and the Days of Awe * Lights: Celebrated Hanukkah Live In Concert - 2008 * Classic Animal Songs - 2006 * Classic Dance Songs - 2006 * Classic Lullabies - 2006 * American Jewish Summer - 2005 * The World Is a Narrow Bridge - 2004 * Totally Zany - 2001 Compilations Produced * My World by Alberto Mizrahi - 2009 * Marshmallow Peeps: Sing Along - 2001 =Lounge Series= * The Shabbat Lounge - 2006 * The Passover Lounge - 2006 * The Hanukkah Lounge - 2005 =Celebrate Series= * Celebrate Breath 2015 * Celebrate Jewish Lullabies: Volume 1 - 2011 * Celebrate Jewish Love Songs - 2009 * My Very First Jewish Celebrate CD: Volume 1 - 2009 * Best of the Celebrate Series - 2006 * Celebrate Hip Hop - 2004 * Celebrate Klezmer - 2004 * Celebrate Yiddish - 2004 * Celebrate Peace - 2003 * Celebrate America - 2002 * Celebrate Kids - 2001 * Celebrate Friends - 2000 * Celebrate Passover - 2000 * Celebrate Shabbat - 2000 * Celebrate Hanukkah - 1999 Themes and Scoring * ‚ÄúOriginal Music‚Äù Steve Harvey Show WB Network, 2000 * ‚ÄúIn Your Arms‚Äù Original song for Warner Brothers Animated Film, 2000 * ‚ÄúCharley Horse Pizza‚Äù, Original Songs for the Shari Lewis Series, PBS 1998 * ‚ÄúRow Row Row‚Äù BMW Television Commercial, 1998 * ‚ÄúRight Connections‚Äù, Showtine Original Film, 1997 * ‚ÄúImaginit‚Äù, Original music for computer animation video, Miramar/BMG, 1997 * ‚ÄúHappily Ever After‚Äù, Original music for animated series, HBO, 1997 * ‚ÄúWe Make Children Smile‚Äù, Mattel Jingle with Foote, Cone and Belding, 1997 * ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Magic‚Äù, Original song for 1996 Olympics Pavilion, Coca-Cola, 1996 * ‚ÄúI Can Do It‚Äù, Original song for Mickey‚Äôs Sports Album, Walt Disney Records, 1996 * ‚ÄúPinochhio‚Äù, Original song for Summer 1996 feature film release, New Line Cinema * ‚ÄúRimba‚Äôs Island‚Äù, Original songs for ‚Äô95 ‚Äì ‚Äô96 seasons, Fox Television Network * ‚ÄúAndre‚Äù, Original song for 1995 feature film, Paramount Pictures * ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a Carnivore‚Äù, 1995 television and radio advertising campaign, Carl‚Äôs Jr. * ‚ÄúHollywood Hounds Christmas‚Äù, Original songs for syndicated television special * ‚ÄúRecycle Rex‚Äù, Original songs and music, Dept. of Conservation/Disney Educational * ‚ÄúGibson Kids‚Äù, Original children‚Äôs complication, Gibson Guitars * ‚ÄúStreet Safe, Street Smart‚Äù, Original songs and music, Disney Educational Film Series * ‚ÄúHalloween Surprises‚Äù, Original songs and music, Disney Video * ‚ÄúKid Songs‚Äù, Original songs and music, Disney Video * ‚ÄúFairfax Mural Project Video‚Äù, Original music, City of Los Angeles * ‚ÄúKRMH‚Äù, Original Theme, Boston Radio * ‚ÄúBrotherhood‚Äù, Original Song, National Conference of Christians and Jews * ‚ÄúNCI‚Äù, Television radio advertising campaign, National Campgrounds, Inc.

It has the Bayer designation E Carinae; V345 Carinae is the variable star designation. The star has a blue-white hue and is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude that fluctuates around +4.66. Its actual brightness varies from magnitude +4.67 to +4.78 with a period of 137.7 days. Based on parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of approximately 1,010 light years from the Sun. It is drifting further away with a radial velocity of around +19 km/s. This star has a stellar classification of B2(IV)n, matching a suspected B-type subgiant star. The 'n' notation indicates \\"nebulous\\" lines caused by rapid rotation: the star is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 140 km/s. It is a Be star having a circumstellar disk of hot, decreted gas that is inserting emission lines into the spectrum. The star is 20 million years old with 9.6 times the mass of the Sun and 8.7 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 2,540 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 19,000 K. The star displays a complex luminosity variation with a periods of 1.13028 and 137.7 days. Although thought to be a single star, Carrier et al. (2002) suggested the longer period may be caused by some sort of binary interaction with the circumstellar disk or perhaps a light reflecting effect. However, no companion has been detected via radial velocity variations. This suggests that the companion would need to either have less than 1.7 times the mass of the Sun or it is being viewed from nearly pole-on. The short-term variations may be from non-radial pulsations similar to those of œâ CMa.

History The property, once known locally as Lea's Woods, was purchased by Memphis on November 14, 1901 for $110,000; it was located along the city's eastern and northern boundary at that time.Judge J.P. Young (editor). 1912. Standard History of Memphis, Tennessee. Knoxville, TN: H.N. Crew and Company. Overton Park was designed by landscape architect George Kessler as part of a comprehensive plan that also included Riverside Park (later M.L. King Riverside Park) and the Memphis Parkway System. The planning began in 1901, and Overton Park was established in 1906.John Linn Hopkins, \\"Memphis Park and Parkway System,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. Retrieved 28 May 2007 The park is named in honor of John Overton, a co-founder of Memphis. Overton's name was selected in a competition to name the new park conducted by the Evening Scimitar, a local newspaper; the three choices in the voting were Memphis founding fathers Andrew Jackson, Overton, and James Winchester.Hair, Patricia. 1978. The General History of Overton Park. Bound report on file in the Memphis Room of the Memphis Public Library. The official naming occurred on July 25, 1902. In the 1960s and 1970s Overton Park was the subject of controversy when 26 of its were slated by highway planners to be demolished to build Interstate 40 through the park to make it easier for suburban commuters to get to downtown. A small number of residents of midtown formed a group known as Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, and challenged the plan in court. Ultimately, the United States Supreme Court ruled in their favor in the landmark case Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe. Nevertheless, the City of Memphis and Tennessee Department of Transportation continued to propose a number of alternatives for routing Interstate 40 through Overton Park, including building the highway in a tunnel, or in a deep trench. In 1978, Citizens to Preserve Overton Park successfully nominated the park to the National Register of Historic Places, thus guaranteeing that without approval from the U.S. Department of the Interior, Federal funding could not be used for projects that damaged the park's historic integrity. The Memphis Commercial Appeal called the National Registration the \\"final nail in the coffin\\" of efforts to route Interstate 40 through Overton Park. Beginning in June 1974, the road system within the interior of Overton Park was gradually closed to motorized vehicles on weekends and holidays, which were called \\"People's Days\\". Although initially there were some objections, the new policy gained popularity, and the closures were made permanent on April 13, 1987 except for official vehicles.Heineke, Thomas E. 2009.

Levitt Shell Overton Park also includes the famous Shell theater, where Elvis Presley gave his first paid concert on July 30, 1954. The Overton Park Shell was built in 1936 by the City of Memphis and the Works Progress Administration for $11,935, as part of the New Deal. Designed by architect Max Furbringer, it was modeled after similar shells in Chicago, New York, and St. Louis. The WPA built 27 band shells; the Overton Park Shell is one of only a few that still remain. After various changes in ownership, the Shell was renamed in 2007 as the Levitt Shell at Overton Park and a large-scale renovation underwritten by the Levitt Foundation was begun. The renovation was conducted by Memphis firm Askew Nixon Ferguson Architects with state-of-the-art audio and visual design. With the completion of the renovations on September 8, 2008, free concerts are now once again held in the Shell.Levitt Shell: Schedule Memphis College of Art Memphis College of Art Memphis College of Art is a small, private college of art and design located in Overton Park. It offers Bachelor of Fine Arts, Master of Fine Arts, Master of Arts in Art Education and Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Some of the majors include graphic design, drawing, painting, printmaking, book arts, computer arts, photography, animation, and illustration. Founded in 1936, it moved into the Overton Park facilities in February, 1959. There are around 450 students each year, with 350 being undergraduate and 100 being graduate students. It is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. Memphis College of Art provides a rigorous curriculum in an intimate, diverse community. It has enabled generations of leading artists, designers and educators to flourish professionally and contribute valuable ideas to society. Unfortunately, due to economic problems, as of October, 2017, the college is no longer enrolling new students, and will close after graduating the present student body. Memphis Zoo Memphis Zoo entrance gate Overton Park Zoo (now named the Memphis Zoo) began in 1906, when a resident of Memphis couldn't keep his pet black bear in his backyard. He had it put in a pen in the park, which attracted many people, inspiring the idea to place more animals on display. The Memphis Zoo is now one of the largest in the United States, attracting 1 million visitors per year. The zoo houses two pandas, who are local celebrities, as well as three polar bears, brought in to the Northwest Passage exhibition which opened in March 2006. The Memphis Zoo is home to more than 3,500 animals representing over 500 different species. The Zoo has been a major tenant of Overton Park for more than 100 years. The city- owned land currently designated to the Zoo was defined by the Overton Park master plan in 1988. The Zoo is set on , of which approximately are developed. In 2008, the Memphis Zoo was ranked \\"#1 Zoo in the U.S.\\" by TripAdvisor.com. In independent surveys commissioned by TripAdvisor, the Memphis Zoo scored a 90 percent overall satisfaction score, almost 25 percent higher than the national zoo average. The Zoo has completed over $77 million for renovation and expansion since the early 1990s. The Zoo's animal inhabitants reside in one-of-a-kind exhibitry, such as Northwest Passage and CHINA - home to giant pandas Ya Ya and Le Le. The Memphis Zoo is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA).

Activities include picnicking, jogging, hiking, nature study and some team sports. An off-leash area is open for dogs. These areas are under management by the Overton Park Conservancy. =Dog park= Overton Bark, a fenced-in, dog park, is located to the southeast of the Greensward; it opened in June 2012. Overton Park Conservancy: Overton Bark Dog Park Opens Saturday, June 2 Separate areas are provided for large and small dogs, and water is available. =Formal Gardens= The walkways, benches, and garden beds of the Formal Gardens extend from Morrie Moss Lane, on the western boundary of Overton Park, to Veterans Plaza; they were established in 1904-05. The gardens present a colorful array of seasonal flowers within a background of scattered evergreen and deciduous trees; the central portion of the gardens is surrounded by Crepe myrtles. Although the composition of the beds has varied over time, the layout has remained basically the same. The Clara Conway Memorial Pergola was built in conjunction with the Formal Gardens to honor Clara Conway, Pioneers of Education in Memphis: Miss Clara Conway a distinguished Memphis educator. Regrettably, the Memorial was destroyed in a 1936 storm, but residents still associate Conway's name with the Formal Gardens. =Greensward= Located in Overton Park and bounded by Veterans Plaza, Rainbow Lake, the Memphis Zoo, and the Golf Course, the Greensward is one of the largest open areas () in Memphis with no designated purpose other than outdoor recreation. Overton Park Master Plan: A 20-year plan of Park improvements and renewals It provides a safe place to play frisbee and soccer, jog, picnic, make music, ride bikes, romp with dogs, fly kites, and just hang out. There are no predetermined locations for activities; users just stake a temporary claim to unoccupied areas and have fun. People of all ages use the Greensward. A portion of the Greensward is used for overflow parking for the Memphis Zoo on busy days. In March 2009, the public became awareTom Charlier, \\"Overton Park may get major alteration to control flooding; Culvert, retention basin may be built; citizens group opposes plans,\\" Memphis ' 'Commercial Appeal' ', March 7, 2009.

The detention basin would slope downward to a maximum depth of approximately , and is estimated by the City Government to be likely to be inundated by floodwater some five to seven times each year. The City estimated the cost of this project at some $4 million. Citizens to Preserve Overton Park opposes the proposed plan on the grounds that it would irreparably damage the park's value to the residents of Memphis, Tennessee.Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, \\"The Tragedy of the Commons?\\" Mar. 5, 2009 The City Government asserts that the public will continue to be able to enjoy the park, and that the slope of the basin will barely be noticeable to park users.

An engineer with the City was quoted as saying, \\"We think it was an appropriate plan, but we've shelved it.\\" Instead, the City will explore two other options, one involving part of the park's golf course, the other involving construction of a berm on another part of the park grounds. =Old Forest Arboretum= The Old Forest Arboretum () is a forest tract and natural arboretum located on the east side of Overton Park. It is open to the public daily without charge. The Old Forest is on the National Register of Historic Places and includes over 300 plant varieties.

Numerous picnic tables are located beneath a nearly continuous canopy of mature oaks. The \\"Picnic Pavilion\\" is centrally located within this area; it was designed by George Kessler and built in 1904. It is the oldest surviving facility in Overton Park. The Picnic Pavilion is wood framed with an elevated floor; it is about 60 feet (18.3 m) in diameter and has a hexagonal shape. Scattered picnic tables are located along the borders of the Greensward and Veterans Plaza. =Playgrounds= There are two publicly accessible playgrounds in Overton Park; one in the East Picnic Area and another to the southeast of the Greensward. The first playground in Overton Park was built in 1911; it was the first publicly accessible playground in Memphis. =Rainbow Lake= Rainbow Lake is a concrete-lined lake forming the eastern boundary of the Greensward. This lake has a curvilinear shape and has a water cascade on its east side. A sidewalk completely goes around the lake.

Notable bygone features The Main Pavilion was the principal gathering place in Overton Park from its construction in 1902 until it was damaged beyond repair by a storm in 1936. It was the first building built in Overton Park. The Formal Garden and Conway Memorial were later built in association with the Main Pavilion, which was located at the east entrance to the Formal Garden. Frequent public dances, concerts, and civic events were held at the Pavilion. One of the best attended presentations was when Charles Lindbergh spoke on the future of aviation on October 5, 1927 as part of the \\"Lindbergh Tour\\". The Pavilion had an observation tower providing scenic views of the surrounding landscape. After its demise, visitor use shifted to the recently constructed Overton Park Shell. In 1914, the Japanese Garden was built around an existing pond in Overton Park, where the Memphis College of Arts is currently located. It was a gift from former Memphis Park Commissioner Robert Galloway. George Kessler, who designed Overton Park, also designed the Japanese Garden, which included pagodas, an arched bridge to a central island, and many decorative sculptures. This area was a popular and highly photographed feature of Overton Park. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Garden was severely damaged by vandalism. Park officials decided that rather than making repairs the structures would be removed, which began on January 2, 1942. A fountain was installed in the redesigned pond, which was retained until construction began on the Memphis College of Arts campus. Donated by Duke C.

Concept and creation Bloody Mary was created by Karl Kesel and debuted in the Hawk and Dove issue \\"Girls Night Out\\". She made subsequent appearances in the Adventures of Superman and Wonder Girl titles. She is a different character than the Bloody Mary supervillain featured in the Batwoman comics. The character and name derives in part from the folklore legend of Bloody Mary, a ghost who is said to appear in a mirror when her name is chanted repeatedly. Fictional character biography A member of the junior Female Furies, Bloody Mary is an energy vampire that enjoys sucking the life out of her victims. She also flies using a disk and can project energy out of her eyes that can hypnotically manipulate her enemies. She hates being touched, and will attack anyone who dares to do so. She has only worked with the Furies on a few occasions. When a mysterious figure began murdering various New Gods, Bloody Mary joined her warrior sisters in an unsuccessful attempt to have Wonder Girl join their ranks for further protection. Bloody Mary was killed in the \\"Clash of the Titans\\" issue of Wonder Girl in 2008 during a fight alongside other members of the Female Furies. She was killed by Infinity-Man, and has not returned since. Powers and abilities Bloody Mary can absorb energy from her victims through vampiric blood sucking. After this is done she can mentally control her victims. She can project beams from her eyes that are able to telekinetically move objects or people. Mary also possesses the ability to sense the presence of other beings in her immediate area.

Nicholas Hammond has shown that God's Algorithm is at most 21 moves (including the four trivial vertex moves). [More recently, three people have found God's Algorithm. The maximal number of moves is 15 (including the four vertex moves).]\\" It refers to any algorithm which produces a solution having the fewest possible moves, the idea being that only an omniscient being would know an optimal step from any given configuration.  Scope  =Definition= The notion applies to puzzles that can assume a finite number of \\"configurations\\", with a relatively small, well-defined arsenal of \\"moves\\" that may be applicable to configurations and then lead to a new configuration. Solving the puzzle means to reach a designated \\"final configuration\\", a singular configuration, or one of a collection of configurations. To solve the puzzle a sequence of moves is applied, starting from some arbitrary initial configuration. =Solution= An algorithm can be considered to solve such a puzzle if it takes as input an arbitrary initial configuration and produces as output a sequence of moves leading to a final configuration (if the puzzle is solvable from that initial configuration, otherwise it signals the impossibility of a solution). A solution is optimal if the sequence of moves is as short as possible. This count is known as God's number, or, more formally, the minimax value. God's algorithm, then, for a given puzzle, is an algorithm that solves the puzzle and produces only optimal solutions. Some writers, such as David Joyner, consider that for an algorithm to be properly referred to as \\"God's algorithm\\", it should also be practical, meaning that the algorithm does not require extraordinary amounts of memory or time. For example, using a giant lookup table indexed by initial configurations would allow solutions to be found very quickly, but would require an extraordinary amount of memory.Joyner, page 149 Instead of asking for a full solution, one can equivalently ask for a single move from an initial but not final configuration, where the move is the first of some optimal solution. An algorithm for the single-move version of the problem can be turned into an algorithm for the original problem by invoking it repeatedly while applying each move reported to the present configuration, until a final one is reached. Conversely, any algorithm for the original problem can be turned into an algorithm for the single-move version by truncating its output to its first move.  Examples  Well-known puzzles fitting this description are mechanical puzzles like Rubik's Cube, Towers of Hanoi, and the 15 puzzle. The one-person game of peg solitaire is also covered, as well as many logic puzzles, such as the missionaries and cannibals problem. These have in common that they can be modeled mathematically as a directed graph, in which the configurations are the vertices, and the moves the arcs. =Mechanical puzzles= n-Puzzles The Fifteen puzzle can be solved in 80 single- tile movesA.

National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 1986. pp. 168‚Äì172. Therefore, whether a practical God's algorithm for this problem exists remains unknown, but appears unlikely. Towers of Hanoi For the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, a God's algorithm is known for any given number of disks. The number of moves is exponential in the number of disks .Carlos Rueda, \\"An optimal solution to the Towers of Hanoi Puzzle\\".

Korf, \\"Finding optimal solutions to Rubik's Cube using pattern databases\\", Proc. Natl. Conf. on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-97), Providence, Rhode Island, Jul 1997, pp. 700‚Äì705. While it had been known since 1995 that 20 was a lower bound on the number of moves for the solution in the worst case, it was proven in 2010 through extensive computer calculations that no configuration requires more than 20 moves.\\"God's Number is 20\\". Cube20.org Thus 20 is a sharp upper bound on the length of optimal solutions.

Examples are the board games chess and Go.Rothenberg, p. 11 Both these games have a rapidly increasing number of positions with each move. The total number of all possible positions, approximately 10154 for chessBaum, p. 187 and 10180 (on a 19√ó19 board) for Go,Baum, p. 199 is much too large to allow a brute force solution with current computing technology (compare the now solved, with great difficulty, Rubik's Cube at only about 4.3√ó1019 positionsSingmaster, 1981). Consequently, a brute force determination of God's algorithm for these games is not possible. While chess computers have been built that are capable of beating even the best human players, they do not calculate the game all the way to the end. Deep Blue, for instance, searched only 11 moves ahead (counting a move by each player as two moves), reducing the search space to only 1017.Baum, p. 188 After this, it assessed each position for advantage according to rules derived from human play and experience. Even this strategy is not possible with Go. Besides having hugely more positions to evaluate, no one so far has successfully constructed a set of simple rules for evaluating the strength of a Go position as has been done for chess. Evaluation algorithms are prone to make elementary mistakesBaum, p.197 so even for a limited look ahead with the goal limited to finding the strongest interim position, a God's algorithm has not been possible for Go. On the other hand, draughts (checkers), with superficial similarities to chess, has long been suspected of being \\"played out\\" by its expert practitioners.Fraser & Hannah, p. 197 In 2007 Schaeffer et al. proved this to be so by calculating a database of all positions with ten or fewer pieces. Thus Schaeffer has a God's algorithm for all end games of draughts and used this to prove that all perfectly played games of draughts will end in a draw.Moore & Mertens, chapter 1.3, \\"Playing chess with God\\" However, draughts with only 5√ó1020 positionsSchaeffer et al., p. 1518 and even fewer, 3.9√ó1013, in Schaeffer's database,Moore & Mertens, \\"Notes\\" to chapter 1 is a much easier problem to crack and is of the same order as Rubik's cube. The magnitude of the set of positions of a puzzle does not entirely determine whether a God's algorithm is possible. The already solved Tower of Hanoi puzzle can have an arbitrary number of pieces, and the number of positions increases exponentially as 3^n. Nevertheless, the solution algorithm is applicable to any size problem, and since the algorithm running time is O(2^n) the problem is NP-hard.Rueda See also *Oracle machine *Divine move *Proofs from THE BOOK Notes References * Baum, Eric B., What is Thought?, MIT Press, 2004 . * Davis, Darryl N.; Chalabi, T.; Berbank-Green, B., \\"Artificial-life, agents and Go\\", in Mohammadian, Masoud, New Frontiers in Computational Intelligence and its Applications, pp. 125‚Äì139, IOS Press, 2000 . * Fraser, Rober (ed); Hannah, W.

The plot revolves around a young couple and their friends struggling with adulthood and issues of relationships and commitment. The film stars Zach Braff, Jacinda Barrett, Casey Affleck and Rachel Bilson. The screenplay was written by Braff and Paul Haggis, and directed by Tony Goldwyn. Much of The Last Kiss was filmed in and around Madison, Wisconsin. As with Garden State, Braff was involved with the film's soundtrack. The first teaser trailer was released on Braff's official website in mid-June 2006.  Plot  Michael and his live-in girlfriend Jenna appear to have the perfect relationship. Jenna is ten weeks pregnant, and her parents are pressuring the pair to get married, but Jenna claims that Michael's work pressures and her working on her dissertation render it an inopportune time for marriage. The real reason, unbeknownst to anyone, is that Michael feels trapped and scared. Although he considers Jenna an ideal companion, Michael is having second thoughts. In a chance encounter at a wedding, Michael meets Kim, to whom he confides about his relationship. Kim guesses he is about to break up with Jenna and becomes flirtatious. While Michael is intrigued by Kim's youthfulness, openness, and spirit, he does not succumb to temptation. The two part ways with Kim telling Michael where she attends school (the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison) and when and where she usually hangs out. Michael eventually seeks her out at the Memorial Union but tells Kim he was in the area only because of a client meeting. Kim senses his romantic interest and, while Michael drives her home, invites him to a party. Michael accepts. Back in the office, Michael constructs an excuse to be away from Jenna on the night of the party. He asks Chris, his friend and co-worker, to cover for him in case Jenna calls. Chris suspects Michael has met another woman and wishes to avoid becoming involved, as Chris himself has just left his wife; he knows first hand how painful a breakup can be. Michael denies the existence of another woman and merely says he will \\"be with an old college friend.\\" After the party with Kim‚Äîwho Michael says makes him \\"feel ten years younger\\"‚Äîthe two kiss several times, preceding Kim inviting Michael to her dorm for the night. Guilt over cheating on Jenna prevails over temptation, however, and he refuses. Unfortunately for Michael, the father of their mutual friend Izzy dies that night. Several friends and acquaintances, including Jenna and Chris, go to Izzy's home with their condolences. There, Jenna realizes Michael had not been, as he claimed, with Chris. Jenna confronts Chris but Chris refuses to answer her questions, which only fuels Jenna's suspicions that Michael has indeed gone astray. When Michael arrives home that night, Jenna becomes confrontational; Michael at first denies he was out with Kim, but eventually admits he had seen another woman. Although he points out he didn't sleep with her and that the outing meant nothing, Jenna is too enraged to believe him and kicks him out of the house, threatening him with a chef's knife. Alone, depressed, and desperate, Michael receives a call from Kim. Kim apologizes for being demanding earlier and asks him to come over for conversation only. Michael agrees. Upon arrival, the pair immediately have sex. The next morning, Michael tries sneaking away without waking Kim but notices once he gets out the door that he left his keys behind. Upon his return, Kim demands to know why he hadn't said goodbye. Michael tells her simply that he did not want to wake her, as he had to be at work early. Kim takes the missing keys out of her pocket and returns them after Michael promises to call her. At work, Michael plans on leaving early to seek out Jenna. On his way out, Kim visits his office unannounced, wanting to give him a mix CD. Michael confides he still loves Jenna, who he informs Kim is pregnant with his baby. He apologizes to Kim for not telling her, and leaves her in search of Jenna. Michael pulls up to Jenna's parents' home, and Jenna's father Stephen, gives a stern lecture about commitment and adulthood and offers advice on winning Jenna's forgiveness. Stephen urges Michael to be completely honest and never stop trying. Equipped with his wisdom, Michael goes into Jenna's room. On the verge of reconciliation, Jenna asks if he was telling the truth about having sex with Kim. Michael says he was telling the truth (at the time)‚Äîbut as a result of Stephen's advice he confesses he went back later that night. Despite Michael's pleas that he was just being honest, Jenna nonetheless becomes outraged and inconsolable, storming out of the house and back to their apartment. Michael follows her back and finds himself locked out. He stakes out on the front porch until Jenna agrees to talk. Both day and night, wet and dry, Michael remains at the front door with many neighbors taking notice and some even providing beverages to him. Stephen even proceeds to drive by in his car and notices Michael, who sees him. A proud smile develops on his face as he drives off, acknowledging that Michael has taken his advice seriously. Slowly, she begins to relent, first tossing out a blanket during a cold evening, then dropping off a sandwich the next day. During the evening of what would have been his third night on the porch, Jenna breaks her silence and speaks to Michael through the closed door. She compares the painful \\"last romantic kiss\\" to her grandmother's death. She says it was a kiss with very painful feeling, and she laments about mourning the loss of the romantic relationship like the loss of someone's life. Later that evening, Jenna opens the door and Michael goes inside.

It inhibits proteases like chymotrypsin, kallikrein, plasmin, thrombin, and trypsin. The specificity is similar to the inhibitor PMSF, nevertheless AEBSF is more stable at low pH values. Typical usage is 0.1 - 1.0 mM.  Mechanism of action  Both AEBSF and PMSF are sulfonyl fluorides and are sulfonylating agents. Sulfonyl fluorides act by reacting with the hydroxy group of the active site serine residue to form a sulfonyl enzyme derivative. This derivative may be stable for long periods of time except at high pH.  Use in cholesterol regulation studies  AEBSF is extensively used in studies aiming to describe cholesterol regulatory genes due to its potent ability to inhibit Site-1-protease (S1P). This serine protease, located in the Golgi apparatus, is responsible for activating the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP). By selectively inhibiting S1P, AEBSF can be used to characterize the downstream result of SREBP inhibition and its influence on cholesterol regulation.

Founded at the end of the 16th century, it received the title of Imperial College due to the patronage of Empress Maria, daughter of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and the wife of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. Philip IV of Spain is considered the founder of the Reales Estudios in 1625. Subjects included theology, philosophy, geography, and the sciences. Later history After the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain (1767), King Charles III re-established the college as the Reales Estudios Superiores de Madrid (1770), a public institution. After the Napoleonic Wars, the Jesuits returned: 1816-1820 and 1823-1834 (during the Trienio Liberal they were kept off the school). In 1835, following the Royal Statute of 1834, the Society of Jesus was suppressed in Spain for the second time, while ‚Äìmore or less simultaneously‚Äì the Complutense University moved from Alcal√° de Henares to Madrid. As a consequence, the college was re-founded again (1835) as a lay institution of secondary education, status that continues today. It was renamed Estudios Nacionales, incorporating as a preparatory school with the newly transferred Complutense University (Universidad de Madrid). In 1845, by the new Constitution and the so-called Pidal's law, the network of National primary and secondary schools is established in Spain, managed by the central government through the Department (later Ministry) of National Education. Hence, the old Imperial College became the Instituto San Isidro, a status that, with few changes, continues today. In 1999, as part of the decentralization process started with the Spanish Constitution of 1978, the property and management of the Instituto San Isidro was transferred to the Government of the Community of Madrid.

Patricia Meadows founded Dallas Contemporary, originally known as the D‚ÄôArt Visual Arts Center, in 1978. In its original form, the museum hosted annual exhibitions of artwork created by its members and offered rental exhibition space to emerging artists. The museum evolved over the next few years to include exhibitions by nonmember artists from various regions around Texas. Dallas Contemporary eventually embraced the entire spectrum of contemporary art, placing Texas artists in a worldwide context. Today, Dallas Contemporary follows the European model of the kunsthalle, or art hall, a welcoming exhibition site for art of the moment. As a non-collecting institution, the museum commissions the creation of new artwork by emerging artists from all walks of life. =Building= Industrial sliding doors installed in the 1950s. Photo by Kevin Todora. Dallas Contemporary is housed in a 37,000 square foot building in the Design District, Dallas, an emerging neighborhood 1.5 miles north of downtown. Built in the 1950s, the building was used for a range of industrial purposes before being redesigned to fit the needs of the museum in 2010. Architect Edward M. Baum was responsible for renovating the space, transforming the structure into one of the largest kunsthalles in the United States. The building‚Äôs inaugural owner was Grinnell Fire Protection. The building was later purchased by United Metal and converted into a steel-manufacturing plant that supplied steel to many of DFW‚Äôs high-rise buildings, ballparks, and roller coasters. Several industrial features still occupy the building‚Äôs interiors, including the original beams, roof trusses, sliding doors, floors and drains, as well a loading dock, dock leveler, and industrial weighing scale.

Background The Peshawar Museum was founded in 1907 as \\"Victoria Hall,\\" in memory of Queen Victoria. The two-story building was built in a syncretic architectural style consisting of British, Hindu, Buddhist and Mughal Islamic styles. The museum initially had only one exhibition hall, but two more were added in 1969‚Äì70. In 2004‚Äì05, the museum was further expanded with the construction of a new block with two galleries, two halls for the museum's collection in storage, offices for the provincial directorate of archaeology, a conservation laboratory and a cafeteria. The historic exhibition hall was also renovated at that time. Collection The current collection has almost 14,000 items based on Gandhara, Greco-Buddhist, Kushan, Parthian, and Indo-Scythian life. Examples include art, sculptures, coins, manuscripts, statues, ancient books, early versions of the Quran, weapons, dresses, jewelry, Kalash effigies, inscriptions, paintings of the Mughal and later periods, household materials and pottery, as well as local and Persian handicrafts. =Gandhara and Greco-Buddhist Art= A Buddhist Triad from the Peshawar Museum, similar to the Brussels Buddha.

This administrative division acquired its name from the former province of Welega. Towns and cities in this zone include Nekemte. East Welega is bounded on the southwest by Illubabor, on the west by the Didessa River which separates it from West Welega, on the northwest and north by the Benishangul- Gumuz Region, on the northeast by Horo Guduru Welega Zone, on the east by West Shewa, and on the southeast by the Gibe River which separates it from Jimma. The highest point in this zone is Mount Garochan (3,276 m). The Central Statistical Agency (CSA) reported that 40,606 tons of coffee were produced in West and East Welega combined in the year ending in 2005, based on inspection records from the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea authority. This represents 35.3% of the Region's output and 17.9% of Ethiopia's total output.CSA 2005 National Statistics , Table D.2  Demographics  Based on the 2007 Census conducted by the CSA, this Zone has a total population of 1,213,503, of whom 606,379 are men and 607,124 women; with an area of 12,579.77 square kilometers, Misraq Welega has a population density of 96.46.

' is referred to as the Year of Africa' because of a series of events that took place during the year‚Äîmainly the independence of seventeen African nations‚Äîthat highlighted the growing Pan-African sentiments in the continent. The year brought about the culmination of African independence movements and the subsequent emergence of Africa as a major force in the United Nations. These rapid political developments led to speculation and hope about the future of Africa as a whole; yet at the same time, the continent was beginning to face the realities of post-colonial violence. This year also saw the beginning of armed opposition to South African apartheid government, with political ramifications across Africa and around the world. Origin Week of the Barricades: January 1960 in Algeria O. H. Morris of the British Ministry of Colonies predicted in early January that \\"1960 will be a year of Africa\\".William Henry Chamberlin, \\"Africa's Year\\", 5 January 1960, accessed via ProQuest. The phrase \\"year of Africa\\" was also used by Ralph Bunche on 16 February 1960. Bunche anticipated that many states would achieve independence in that year due to the \\"well nigh explosive rapidity with which the peoples of Africa in all sectors are emerging from colonialism.\\"Paul Hoffmann, \\"Bunche says '60 is year of Africa\\", New York Times, 16 February 1960, p. 15; accessed via ProQuest. The concept of a \\"Year of Africa\\" drew international media attention.Daniel Schwartz, \\"1960: The Year of Africa\\", CBC, June 8, 2010. The mythology of the year was also influenced by the \\"Wind of Change\\" speech, delivered on 3 February 1960 by Harold Macmillan. Speaking in Cape Town, Macmillan acknowledged that imperial powers would have difficulty continuing to control their colonies.Manuel Manrique Gil, \\"1960-2010: 50 years of 'African independences'\\", On Africa, 4 January 2010. The speech represented an admission by the British political elite that the British Empire was over and could not be revived. This inspired a reaction from the Empire Loyalist wing of the Conservative Party; see Conservative Monday Club. Africans also reacted. In the words of Guinean Foreign Minister Caba Sory:\\"Excerpts of the Statements by U.N. Delegates on South Africa's Racial Policies\\", New York Times, 1 April 1960, quoted by Ryan Irwin, \\"The Gordian Knot\\", dissertation at Ohio State, 2010. Independence During 1960, the number of independent countries rose from nine (with populations of 95 million) to twenty-six (with populations of 180 million), gaining their independence from Belgium, France and the United Kingdom.Foderaro, Independent Africa (1976), p. 53. =From France= In response to mounting conflict in Algeria‚Äîparticularly the May 1958 crisis‚ÄîFrance created a new constitution in 1958. This constitution made colonial states part of the \\"French Community\\" (La Communaut√©) which restructured the French empire as a sort of federation.Frederick Cooper, \\"Possibility and Constraint: African Independence in Historical Perspective\\", Journal of African History 49(2), All member states acceded to the agreement except for Guinea, which obtained independence in 1958 when it refused to join La Communaut√©. Its decision led France to cut off all support but set a precedent for other French colonies.De Lusignan, French-Speaking Africa Since Independence (1969), p. 24. \\"The break with France was absolute; according to a hastily devised plan, French civil servants were to leave within two months. Guinea would receive no more help from the French administration, and no more equipment credits. Overnight, Guinea found itself penniless... Guinea's daring vote of 'No' became a burning pang of conscience for all French-speaking countries.\\" In December 1959, returning French leader Charles De Gaulle agreed that member states could have independence if they chose.De Lusignan, French- Speaking Africa Since Independence (1969), p. 25. \\"As early as December 10, 1959, at the sixth session of the Executive Council of the Community, de Gaulle agreed that international sovereignty should be granted to any state which requested it, and that new agreements on co-operation might be negotiated between African states and France. The race for independence had started.\\" All did, at a rate much faster than France anticipated.De Lusignan, French-Speaking Africa Since Independence (1969), pp. 28 * Cameroon (formerly Cameroun) achieved independence on the first day of 1960 (unifying with British Cameroons in 1961). * Togo (formerly French Togoland) achieved independence on 27 April * Mali Federation became independent on 20 June, then split into Mali and Senegal on 20 August * Madagascar became independent on 26 June * Dahomey (renamed to Benin in 1975) became independent on 1 August * Niger, independent on 3 August * Upper Volta (renamed to Burkina Faso in 1984), independent on 5 August * Ivory Coast (C√¥te d'Ivoire), independent on 7 August * Chad, independent on 11 August * Central African Republic, independent on 13 August * Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville), independent on 15 August * Gabon, independent on 17 August * Mauritania, independent on 28 November These countries remained within the French sphere of influence, particularly in economic terms.De Lusignan, French-Speaking Africa Since Independence (1969), p. 35. \\"France was able to change its political, economic, and military status in Black Africa, and yet retain the former colonies within its sphere of influence... If France played its cards well, Africa would still be a market in which it retained a highly privileged position‚Äîa ready market for French manufactured goods and itself exporting a wide range of raw materials (notably groundnuts, palm oil, tropical timber, iron, manganese, bauxite, aluminum, and uranium.\\" France also brokered political agreements with the Mali Federation and Madagascar, waiving the mandate that departure from the French Community would lead to the end of political ties (as it had for Guinea).De Lusignan, French-Speaking Africa Since Independence (1969), pp. 29‚Äì30. French companies thus accepted the arrangement, because they would remain well-positioned to profit from the newly independent countries‚Äîwhich also continued to use colonial (CFA) francs.De Lusignan, French-Speaking Africa Since Independence (1969), pp. 35‚Äì36. The new constitutions created by these countries use some ideas from the French Constitution, including values of democracy and universal rights as well as a parliamentary system with a strong executive. They also sometimes use language from the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They all emphasize Pan-Africanism over nationalism.De Lusignan, French-Speaking Africa Since Independence (1969), pp. 75‚Äì77. =From the United Kingdom= Two countries achieved independence from the UK in 1960: Somalia, through the unification of British Somaliland and the Trust Territory of Somalia, and Nigeria. On 26 June (also the day of Madagascar's independence), British Somaliland became the independent State of Somaliland. Five days later, it united with the Italian Trust Territory of Somalia to create the Somali Republic on 1 July.Foderaro, Independent Africa (1976), p. 57. Nigeria had the largest population and best economy on the continent. It became independent on 1 October.Foderaro, Independent Africa (1976), p. 59. Also in 1960, the Dominion of Ghana voted to become a Republic, thereby ending Queen Elizabeth II's rule, 1957‚Äì1960, as the Queen of Ghana. World-famous Pan-Africanist Kwame Nkrumah, formerly the Prime Minister, was simultaneously elected President, on 27 April 1960.Francis Bennion, Constitutional Law of Ghana; London: Butterworths, 1962. =From Belgium= Lumumba in Brussels, January 1960 The Congolese had been agitating heavily for independence, and at the beginning of 1960 Patrice Lumumba was imprisoned for inciting a riot in 1959. Recognizing that the Congo was going to become independent, Belgium freed Lumumba and allowed him to attend a conference in Brussels from 18‚Äì27 January. At the conference, 30 June was established as independence day for the Republic of the Congo. Lumumba won a large plurality in the May elections and became Prime Minister of the country on 30 June.Osei Boateng, \\"Lumumba: 'We shall show the world what the black man can do when he is allowed to work in freedom'\\", New African, February 2010. The spirit of the occasion inspired the celebrated Congolese musician Le Grand Kall√© to write the song \\"Ind√©pendance Cha Cha\\", which became a pan-African hit. The country was soon embroiled in turmoil, and Lumumba was deposed on 14 September. He was subsequently tortured and executed.Abayomi Azikiwe, \\"50th Anniversary of the 'Year of Africa' 1960\\", Pan-African News Wire, 21 April 2010. The subsequent period of instability is sometimes called the Congo Crisis. The events in the Congo led the London Daily Express‚Äîwhich had consistently favoured colonialism‚Äîto denounce the \\"Year of Africa\\" and call for 1961 to be a \\"year of realism\\".Henry S. Hayward, \\"Belgium Gives Bitter Lesson\\", Christian Science Monitor, 28 December 1960, p. 1.; accessed via ProQuest. South Africa \\"Murder at Sharpeville\\", Godfrey Rubens‚Äîthe Sharpeville Massacre brought worldwide attention to apartheid The Sharpeville Massacre in South Africa took place on 21 March 1960, triggering mass underground resistance as well as international solidarity demonstrations.Imran Garda, \\"Sharpeville: Legacy of a massacre\\", Al Jazeera, 22 March 2010. This event is sometimes cited as the beginning of worldwide struggle against apartheid.David Smith, \\"Sharpeville 50 years on: 'At some stage all hell will break loose'\\", The Guardian, 19 March 2010. South African activists and academics describe it as a turning point in the resistance, marking the end of nonviolence and liberalism.Lodge, Sharpeville (2011), pp.167‚Äì168. Some say that its biggest impact came in making white South Africans aware of the brutality with which political Blacks were being suppressed.Lodge, Sharpeville (2011), p.168. \\"[...] more ameliorationist perceptions shaped a parallel course of liberal scholarship both within and outside South Africa; for its constituents, Sharpeville's 'epoch-making' significance was in making the 'reality' of black urbanization and industrialization obvious to white South Africans.\\" On October 5, a referendum was passed in South Africa which abolished the monarchy, which set up South Africa's leaving the Commonwealth of Nations the next year over its racial policies.  United Nations  In October, Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah delivered an address to the United Nations in which he discussed Africa's role in the world and the future role of the world in Africa.Ryan M. Irwin, \\"Imagining nation, state, and order in the mid-twentieth century\\", Kronos 37(1), 2011. Nkrumah asserted Africa's new power, saying it did not wish revenge on its European colonizers, but would insist on freedom: > One cardinal fact of our time is the momentous impact of Africa‚Äôs awakening > upon the modern world. The flowing tide of African nationalism sweeps > everything before it and constitutes a challenge to the colonial powers to > make a just restitution for the years of injustice and crime committed > against our continent. > But Africa does not seek vengeance.

Africa wants her freedom. Africa must be free. It is a > simple call, but it‚Äôs also a signal lighting a red warning to those who > would tend to ignore it.Kwame Nkrumah, speech to United Nations, excerpted > on Democracy Now. Nkrumah called for an end to white supremacy, particularly in South Africa.Ryan Irwin, The Gordian Knot: Apartheid and the Unmaking of the Liberal World Order, 1960‚Äì1970, dissertation submitted at Ohio State University, 2010. In an introduction the printed text of the speech, W.E.B. Du Bois writes: \\"...there can be no doubt that Kwame Nkrumah is the Voice of Africa. That is, that more nearly than any other living man he expresses the thought and ideals of the dark continent and that this continent is stepping to the forefront in world affairs.\\"\\"Nkrumah at the United Nations\\" On 14 December 1960, the UN General Assembly approved the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. This statement affirms that \\"all peoples have the right to self-determination\\", and that rule by outside powers constitutes is a violation of human rights. The statement passed with no votes against. The United States and seven other colonial powers abstained; Zelma George, an African American in the U.S. delegation, stood to signify her support of the Declaration.Houser, No One Can Stop the Rain (1989), p. 61.

Implications and legacy Pro-independence rally in Northern Rhodesia (later Zambia), March 1960 The Year of Africa altered the symbolic status of Africans worldwide, by having the world recognize the existence of African nations as a force to be reckoned with on the international arena. It marked the beginning of a new, more Afrocentric era in African studies, marked by the founding of the Cahiers d'√âtudes africaines and the Journal of African History.John Lonsdale, \\"African Studies, Europe & Africa\\", afrika spectrum 40(3), 2005.Johannes du Bruyn, \\"The \\"Forgotten factor\\" sixteen years later: some trends in historical writing on precolonial South Africa\\", Kleio 16(1), 1984; .

And it was the year of Africa. We throw ourselves into solidarity work for the great freedom movements of the Congo, fought to head off the assassination of Lumumba, linked arms and hearts with the South African freedom struggle, supported the arms struggle of Angola and Mozambique against Portuguese rule, were in the forefront of bringing a consciousness of Africa to our people.\\" The Baltimore Afro-American, confident that sit-ins would defeat segregation in the Southern United States, editorialized: \\"The 'winds of change' which are sweeping over Africa, are blowing in the benighted areas of the United States, too.\\"\\"Winds Of Change Are Blowing\\", Baltimore Afro-American, 26 March 1960. Professor James H. Meriwether, looking back on the Year of Africa, writes: \\"The events of 1960 strengthened links between African Americans and the worldwide struggle against white supremacy, while doing so on a more Africa-centered basis.\\"Meriwether, Proudly We Can Be Africans (2002), p. 182. More concretely, resisters to segregation in the Southern United States may have begun to look to South Africa for inspiration‚Äîand vice versa.Meriwether, Proudly We Can Be Africans (2002), p. 194.

She was the mother of Queen Isabella I \\"the Catholic\\". She was born as a scion of a collateral branch of the Aviz dynasty that had ruled Portugal since 1385. Her parents were John, Constable of Portugal, the youngest surviving son of John I of Portugal, and his half-niece and wife, Isabella of Barcelos, the daughter of the Duke of Braganza, an illegitimate son of the king. Marriage Isabella was married to King John II of Castile as his second wife. His first wife, Mary of Aragon, had given him four children, though only one, the future Henry IV of Castile, had survived. Henry had been joined to Blanche II of Navarre in an unconsummated marriage for seven years and was called \\"El Impotente.\\" Because of this, John decided to seek another wife, preferably with a French princess. However, his trusted adviser and friend Alvaro de Luna decided a Portuguese alliance was better politically, and negotiated a match with the much younger Isabella. The two were wed on 22 July 1447 when John was 42 and Isabella 19. =Conflict with de Luna= Coat of arms of Isabella of Portugal as Queen of Castile. De Luna had dominated the king since he was young and doubtless expected this to continue after the marriage. De Luna tried to control the young queen as well, even going as far as to attempt to limit the couplings between the amorous king and his bride. Isabella took exception to de Luna's influence over her husband and attempted to persuade her husband to remove this favourite. Rumors that de Luna had attempted to poison Isabella, and that he had also poisoned and murdered her predecessor, Mary of Aragon, still persist to this day. Isabella, being aware of this, set herself to the task of persuading the king to agree to rid himself of de Luna. She had little success until after the 1451 birth of her daughter and namesake who would become Isabella I of Castile. The queen's confinement was long and difficult. In 1453, de Luna had nobleman Alfonso P√©rez de Vivero thrown out of a window, as the nobleman had sided against the constable. Isabella used this as leverage, and convinced the king to have him arrested and tried. King John did as his wife asked, and de Luna was executed. The death of his favourite saddened the king, and his health began to decline rapidly. On 15 November 1453, Isabella gave birth to a son, Alfonso, and eight months later, John was on his deathbed, expiring at last on 20 July 1454. Henry IV, newly divorced from Blanche, became king. Widowhood After Henry ascended the throne, he sent his stepmother, who was three years younger than himself, and his two half- siblings to the Castle of Ar√©valo. The dowager queen and her two children lived austerely with Isabella's mother, who had travelled to Arevalo to assist her. There is no evidence that the widowed queen ever considered remarrying. While at Ar√©valo, Isabella sank deeper into the melancholy that had begun after the birth of her elder child. She was permitted to keep her children until 1461, the year in which Henry's second queen, Joan of Portugal, became pregnant with Joanna, Princess of Asturias, supposedly by her alleged lover, Beltr√°n de La Cueva. Relationship with daughter Alfonso had died under suspicious circumstances in 1468. In 1469, Isabella told her half- brother(Henry IV) that she was going to visit her mother in Ar√©valo, but in fact travelled to Valladolid to marry Ferdinand of Aragon, the heir of John II of Aragon. When Henry IV died in 1474, Isabella bypassed the claims of her niece, who had never been considered legitimate, to become Queen of Castile. During her travels around Spain, she would visit her mother every year or so, always waiting personally on her to show her respect. The Dowager queen continued to live in retirement until she died in 1496 \\"worn out and enfeebled by age\\". Interment Tomb of Isabella of Portugal After her death, she was interred next to her husband in the crypt under the royal sepulcher, with Alfonso whose tomb is placed to the side in the Miraflores Charterhouse. Her daughter Isabella raised ornately carved tombs in their memory. In 2006, on the occasion of the restoration of the Charterhouse, an anthropological study of the physical remains of John II, Isabella, and their son, Alfonso of Castile was carried out by researchers from the University of Le√≥n. The skeleton of King John II was almost complete, however only fragments of Queen Isabella's bones remained. Issue Her children were: * Isabella I of Castile. Married Ferdinand II of Aragon, she became Queen of Castile and united Aragon with Castile. * Alfonso, Prince of Asturias who rebelled against his half-brother, Henry IV of Castile He died of a sickness, probably the plague, no issue.

As a player he was a left-back from 2002 to 2017. He could also operate as a centre half. He played for Leeds United, Cambridge United, Darlington, Leyton Orient, Grimsby Town, Rochdale, Bury, Rotherham United, Scunthorpe United, Oxford United and Northampton Town. Club career =Leeds United= Born in Sheffield, West Yorkshire, Newey began his career as a trainee with Leeds United in August 2002. He was loaned to Cambridge United in February 2003 where he made seven league and cup appearances, and was then loaned to Darlington in March 2003 where he also made seven appearances, scoring one goal. He was offered a permanent contract by Darlington in May 2003 but turned it down. =Leyton Orient= After being released by Leeds, Newey joined Leyton Orient in July 2003, where he went on to make 63 appearances, scoring three goals. Following a loan spell with Cambridge United, he joined the club on a permanent basis in March 2005. =Cambridge United= After joining Cambridge late in the 2004‚Äì05 campaign, Newey made 16 appearances for Cambridge in their failed bid to fight off relegation and was released after Cambridge were relegated from the Football League. =Grimsby Town= Newey signed a one-year contract with Grimsby Town in June 2005 and was one of the first new signings under Grimsby's new boss at the time, Russell Slade. He made 43 league and cup appearances for Grimsby in the 2005‚Äì06 season as Grimsby challenged for promotion only to lose out in the play-off final. Newey managed to keep down a regular spot at left back, despite having stiff competition from veteran Gary Croft. Slade departed Blundell Park at the end of the season, but new manager Graham Rodger convinced Newey to sign a new three-year contract with the club in the summer of 2006. Grimsby struggled in the new season, and Rodger was replaced by Alan Buckley. Newey continued to keep his place and he made a further 46 league and cup appearances in the 2006‚Äì07 season. In the 2007‚Äì08 campaign, Newey became the club's interim captain as veteran Justin Whittle spent the majority of the campaign on the substitute bench. That season, he was part of the squad that reached the final of the Football League Trophy at Wembley Stadium. Grimsby lost the game 2‚Äì0 to the MK Dons. Following Buckley's dismissal in September 2008, Newey re-established himself under new manager Mike Newell until a mid-season injury halted his first-team aspirations. Newell moved to sign West Ham United left back Joe Widdowson in his absence. On his return to fitness, Grimsby accepted an approach by rivals Lincoln City to take Newey on loan; however, the player rejected the chance of playing at Sincil Bank due to his fitness levels not being adequate to merit a first-team place. Newey returned to first-team action a few weeks later, but found himself out of favour, with Newell preferring to use Widdowson, freezing the long-term Grimsby left back out of his regular spot in the team. On 17 March 2009, Newey was told he could leave the club on a free transfer along with goalkeepers Phil Barnes and Gary Montgomery.Trio Released, GTFC World, 17 March 2009. Retrieved 17 March 2009 Although Barnes and Montgomery both left, Newey was loaned out to Rochdale for the remaining month of the 2008‚Äì09 season. On 30 April Newey was told along with Peter Till that they would not be offered a new contract for the 2009‚Äì10 season. Newey was also told by Rochdale a few days later that he would not be invited to join the club for the new season, something he had expressed his desire to do after admitting enjoying working alongside Dale players, and former Grimsby teammates Simon Ramsden and Ciaran Toner. =Bury and Rotherham United= Newey playing for Oxford United in 2013 On 28 August 2009 Newey signed a twelve-month contract with Bury following a successful trial spell with the club. Newey played 32 times for Bury in the league before leaving at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. Newey signed for fellow Football League Two side Rotherham United in the summer of 2010. He was released by Rotherham in May 2012. =Scunthorpe United= In July 2012 he joined Scunthorpe United on trial. Newey and Scunthorpe were relegated to League Two in May 2013; despite his initially being offered a new deal, the club signed Andy Dawson and released Newey. =Oxford United= On 4 July 2013, Newey joined Oxford United on a free transfer. In his first season with the club, Newey made 40 league starts and was the Oxford's first-choice left-back. He scored his first goal for the club against AFC Wimbledon on 1 February 2014. Newey was awarded with a new one- year contract on 27 May 2014. On 30 October 2014, Newey joined Northampton Town on loan until 3 January 2015. On 26 January 2015, Newey was released from his contract. =Northampton Town= On 27 January 2015, Newey joined Northampton Town on a free transfer until the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season. Coaching career Newey retired from professional football due to injury in 2017 and joined the coaching staff at Rotherham United as an academy coach. He has also obtained his UEFA A and B coaching licence. He is also a coach at Queen Ethelburgas Collegiate alongside his former Grimsby teammate Paul Bolland.https://uk.linkedin.com/in/tom-newey-b01689111 In July 2017, Newey joined his old club Leeds United as Under 15s & Under 16s Coach.

History Formed in 1996 at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, Dreadnaught regularly toured the Northeast United States through the recording of its first two albums, Dreadnaught (1998) and Una Vez Mas (2000). Both releases featured vocal- oriented roots-rock interspersed with progressive, art rock, and jazz elements; during this period, the band's live shows were marked by aggressive, energetic instrumental improvisation and increasingly sophisticated musical structures. By the time of the recording of 2001's The American Standard (Red Fez Records), the band (now a trio consisting of bassist Bob Lord, guitarist Justin Walton, and drummer Rick Habib) was touring nationally and had become more radical in composition and performance; The American Standard presented classical and jazz influenced multi-movement suites, quirky pop songs, and avant-garde metal instrumentals with augmented orchestration, including strings, brass, and winds. Critical response to the album was widespread and enthusiastic, exposing European, Eurasian, and South American audiences to the band for the first time and landing the group on numerous 'best of' listings. After three years of steady touring and performance in support of The American Standard, Dreadnaught released the highly experimental Musica En Flagrante (Big Balloon Music/Red Fez) in 2004. Reflecting Lord's ongoing active work in film scoring and custom audio, Flagrante was an entirely instrumental set of pieces featuring widely expanded instrumentation and recording techniques in addition to the debut of drummer Tim Haney (previously and subsequently a member of SeepeopleS). The double-disc album Live At Mojo arrived in 2005 from the Italian label Comet Records and received a 4-star review from Allmusic upon release; the album was recorded live in the studio in late 2003 at the end of a national tour by Lord, Walton, and Haney, and features cuts not heard on any other Dreadnaught recordings, including cover tunes by Warren Zevon, Dick Curless, Frank Zappa, and John Entwistle. In 2005, Habib returned to the fold, and Lord released his first solo set, Audio For Film TV & Games (Red Fez), a collection of cuts culled from the bassist's visual media projects. Dreadnaught worked steadily in the studio during 2006 to record new material with longtime engineer Shaun Frenchie Michaud, this time blending the musical extremity of prior sessions with a return to a more vocal-based style. Throughout the year the group also recorded music composed by Lord for film (The Elevator Chaser for OxRock Productions) and radio (The Exchange for NHPR), and in early 2007 re-recorded The Who's Going Mobile for a national marketing campaign. In 2007, HIGH HEAT & CHIN MUSIC: 10 YEARS OF DREADNAUGHT, a double-disc retrospective featuring 2006's new studio tracks along with tracks from each of the band's prior albums, was released by Big Balloon/Red Fez to glowing reviews and critical acclaim. In the autumn of 2012 Dreadnaught was invited to perform at the legendary Progday festival in Chapel Hill NC, and serendipitously landed the prestigious Sunday morning \\"church\\" slot. This now near-mythical performance, by the lineup that recorded the classic The American Standard, was rewarded with a thunderous standing ovation. Response to their performance was so enthusiastic they were invited back to play the Friday Progday pre-show in 2013. The fall of 2013 saw the release of new material from the trio in the form of an EP entitled Have A Drink With Dreadnaught, and early 2015 saw the release of another EP titled Gettin' Tight With Dreadnaught. Both EPs were received rapturously by fans of the band on social media, as well as receiving uniformly positive critical reviews. 2011 brought the release of Justin Walton's first solo album It Takes A Toll, which was a solo album in every sense of the word. Walton wrote, engineered, sang, and played all the instruments on every track. Unlike some musicians who attempt this approach, Walton shows himself to be an accomplished player on an array of instruments, and an excellent studio engineer. Justin released his second solo disc in 2015, Blood From A Stone. Of course, a huge feature of both albums is Walton's top-shelf, fluid guitar work, as well as his warm, enticing vocals. While Walton was busy working solo, Lord and Habib formed a side-project trio with guitarist John McCormack, and released a disc in October 2016 under the moniker \\"Order Of Thieves\\". The songs contain many of the trademark elements of the Dreadnaught sound, but McCormack puts his own unique stamp on each of the tracks, mainly through a seemly endless fountain of heavy, gargantuan-sounding riffs. The band describes the album as 'power prog', which is certainly on target. Dreeadnaught's new full-length CD \\"HARD CHARGIN\\" was released in mid-June 2017. While easily the most challenging, envelope-pushing music the band has ever put to tape, reception of the disc from the group's fanbase has been uniformly enthusiastic. Critical reviews in magazines, online music sites, and blog sites have been unanimously positive. Rave reviews appeared in Expose' Online and Stereo Embers Magazine, and Progression Magazine gave it a 4-out-of-5 star rating. Dreadnaught have performed several shows in the New England area since the new album's release. At the most recent performance they performed \\"HARD CHARGIN\\" in its entirety. The band is not taking their renewed energy or excitement from old and new fans for granted. They are reportedly already at work on their next album, and hope to perform more shows in 2018 as their schedules allow. Performances Dreadnaught has received attention for energetic, humorous, and virtuosic performances that are musically diverse and, at times, highly unorthodox. In addition to its solo tours, the band has served as opening act for John Entwistle (The Who), Tony Levin (Peter Gabriel, King Crimson), NRBQ, Jim Weider (The Band), California Guitar Trio, and the Young Dubliners. In 2005, the group began a prominent stint as house band for the New Hampshire Public Radio series Writers On A New England Stage at the Music Hall in Portsmouth NH, where it has performed with Dan Brown (The Da Vinci Code), Alan Alda, Doris Kearns Goodwin, John Updike, Elmore Leonard, Anita Diamant, and Mitch Albom. The series has attracted international coverage and has been featured in press outlets such as The Today Show and Good Morning America; the 2007 season includes Pulitzer Prize winner Richard Russo and renowned documentary filmmaker Ken Burns.

History Built by the Freemasons in the 1920s, the building was originally a Masonic temple. It remained that way until the 1960s, during which the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi used it as his Los Angeles center for Transcendental Meditation. The Building maintains much of the original Masonic characteristics including a large Auditorium/Masonic Meeting Hall and original stained glass windows. Once converted to a studio in the late 1960s the Village was the birthplace of classic records including Aja by Steely Dan, Joe's Garage by Frank Zappa, Planet Waves by Bob Dylan and many more. The Village is home to a vintage Neve 8048 console as well as two Neve 88R consoles. The Village is renowned for its extensive inventory of vintage microphones and outboard gear. The Village also has Oscar Peterson's Steinway & Sons Model A, which Peterson used extensively from the 1940s through the 1980s. John Mayer recorded parts of his album Continuum at The Village Recorder - and released some of those sessions on his EP The Village Sessions, featuring Ben Harper. Many major motion picture and television soundtracks have also been recorded at the studio, including Ace Ventura, Dead Poets Society, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Simpsons, Toy Story 2, Walk the Line, The X Files, Wall-E, Revolutionary Road, The Shawshank Redemption and others. The Village also becomes home to KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic radio show, hosted by Jason Bentley, during on-air membership drives when the station's own performance room is unavailable.

September 18, 1592 - May 30, 1663) was the patriarch of one of the earliest families to settle on the North shore of New France's St. Lawrence River. Guyon made his living as a master mason and, according to Perche-born genealogist Madame Montagne, was regarded as having an excellent reputation as a mason. In 1615, he helped construct the Saint- Aubin de Tourouvre church steeple's interior stone staircase and in 1625 he was charged with the re-building of Mortagne's fortifications.  Habitant in New France  Guyon was from the village of Tourouvre's Saint-Aubin parish located in Chartres diocese, ancient Perche province, and present-day Normandy's Orne department. Guyon and his family emigrated from Perche province to New France on the North shore of the Saint Lawrence River near present-day Quebec city as part of the Percheron immigration movement, a pioneering group of about 300 colonists who settled in Canada in the three decades starting in 1632. Robert Giffard de Moncel was granted by the Company of Hundred Associates the Beauport seigneurie, one of the New France's first seigneuries, Beauport now being a borough of Quebec City. The Beauport seigneurie was to be the first agriculturally-based settlement requiring the recruitment of tradesmen such as Guyon to establish the new colony. At the end of a three-year service contact taking effect on arrival in Canada, Guyon was in turn granted a one-thousand-arpent arri√®re-fief (subordinated-fief) land concession from Giffard. Guyon traveled aboard a convoy of four ships under the command of Charles Duplessis-Bochart and arrived in New France in 1634. As Guyon's arri√®re-fief was located near rivi√®re du Buisson (river of bushes), Guyon exercised his seigniorial system right to be known as Guyon du Buisson. He built a small mill and helped build the parish church of nearby Quebec and Giffard's seigniorial manor. For nine years, he and Zacharie Cloutier disputed Giffard's seigniorial rights to receive foi et hommage (fealty and homage). Refusing to accept him as their superior, they did not stake their lands or pay him annual taxes. On July 19, 1646, the governor of the colony took action to force Cloutier and Guyon to comply with their contractual obligations. Such cases of censitaire refractoriness filled the time of the courts for the duration of the seigniorial system, both during the French regime and under the English. His eldest son, also named Jean Guyon, married √âlisabeth Couillard, daughter of :fr:Guillaume Couillard, New France's first settler to be ennobled by Louis XIV, and granddaughter of Louis H√©bert, the first French colonist established with his family in New France. Their wedding was accompanied by the \\"two violins...which had not been seen yet in Canada.\\" After his death in 1693, his heirs engaged in a protracted legal dispute over his lands. Descendants Guyon fathered ten children, eight of whom married, and he is known to be an ancestor of many French Canadians. By 2006, news media noted that at least three out of four Qu√©b√©cois descend from him. The descendants are often recognized as Dion, sometimes as Despres, Dumontier, Lemoine, in Louisiana as Derbanne and Texas as Berban. According to Charbonneau et al. 1993,more than 2,150 births of Guyon descendants had by 1730 been recorded. According to the Universit√© de Montr√©al's Research Program in Historical Demography (PRDH), Guyon had by the end of the 19th century 9,674 married descendants, and thus ranked second among top New France pioneers in terms of number of married descendants. The PRDH program enabled neurological researchers to trace 40 cases of classical Friedreich's ataxia, a rare inherited disease, across 12 generations previously unrelated French- Canadians descendants to one common ancestral couple: Guyon and his wife Mathurine Robin. The disease causes progressive damage to the nervous system resulting in symptoms ranging from gait disturbance and speech problems to heart disease. The finding allows for gene chromosomal localization studies that had previously been judged to be almost impossible in rare autosomal recessive disorders. Toponymy and memorials In 1984, the 350th anniversary of Guyon's arrival, Quebec City named a park after him and a commemorative plaque to honour Guyon was mounted on the church in Beauport by the Association des Dion d'Am√©rique inc. In 2006, the city renamed a street after him.

Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords, and payment card numbers. Cookies perform essential functions in the modern web. Perhaps most importantly, authentication cookies are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in with. Without such a mechanism, the site would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information, or require the user to authenticate themselves by logging in. The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user's web browser, and on whether the cookie data is encrypted. Security vulnerabilities may allow a cookie's data to be read by a hacker, used to gain access to user data, or used to gain access (with the user's credentials) to the website to which the cookie belongs (see cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery for examples). Tracking cookies, and especially third-party tracking cookies, are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories a potential privacy concern that prompted European and U.S. lawmakers to take action in 2011. European law requires that all websites targeting European Union member states gain \\"informed consent\\" from users before storing non-essential cookies on their device. Google Project Zero researcher Jann Horn describes ways cookies can be read by intermediaries, like Wi-Fi hotspot providers. He recommends to use the browser in incognito mode in such circumstances.Want to use my wifi? , Jann Horn, accessed 2018-01-05. Background HTTP cookies share their name with a popular baked treat. =Origin of the name= The term \\"cookie\\" was coined by web-browser programmer Lou Montulli. It was derived from the term \\"magic cookie\\", which is a packet of data a program receives and sends back unchanged, used by Unix programmers. =History= Magic cookies were already used in computing when computer programmer Lou Montulli had the idea of using them in web communications in June 1994. At the time, he was an employee of Netscape Communications, which was developing an e-commerce application for MCI. Vint Cerf and John Klensin represented MCI in technical discussions with Netscape Communications. MCI did not want its servers to have to retain partial transaction states, which led them to ask Netscape to find a way to store that state in each user's computer instead. Cookies provided a solution to the problem of reliably implementing a virtual shopping cart.Kesan, Jey; and Shah, Rajiv ; Deconstructing Code , SSRN.com, chapter II.B (Netscape's cookies), Yale Journal of Law and Technology, 6, 277‚Äì389Kristol, David; HTTP Cookies: Standards, privacy, and politics, ACM Transactions on Internet Technology, 1(2), 151‚Äì198, 2001 (an expanded version is freely available at arXiv:cs/0105018v1 [cs.SE]) Together with John Giannandrea, Montulli wrote the initial Netscape cookie specification the same year. Version 0.9beta of Mosaic Netscape, released on October 13, 1994, supported cookies. The first use of cookies (out of the labs) was checking whether visitors to the Netscape website had already visited the site. Montulli applied for a patent for the cookie technology in 1995, and was granted in 1998. Support for cookies was integrated in Internet Explorer in version 2, released in October 1995. The introduction of cookies was not widely known to the public at the time. In particular, cookies were accepted by default, and users were not notified of their presence. The general public learned about cookies after the Financial Times published an article about them on February 12, 1996. In the same year, cookies received a lot of media attention, especially because of potential privacy implications. Cookies were discussed in two U.S. Federal Trade Commission hearings in 1996 and 1997. The development of the formal cookie specifications was already ongoing. In particular, the first discussions about a formal specification started in April 1995 on the www-talk mailing list. A special working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) was formed. Two alternative proposals for introducing state in HTTP transactions had been proposed by Brian Behlendorf and David Kristol respectively. But the group, headed by Kristol himself and Lou Montulli, soon decided to use the Netscape specification as a starting point. In February 1996, the working group identified third-party cookies as a considerable privacy threat. The specification produced by the group was eventually published as RFC 2109 in February 1997. It specifies that third-party cookies were either not allowed at all, or at least not enabled by default. At this time, advertising companies were already using third-party cookies. The recommendation about third-party cookies of RFC 2109 was not followed by Netscape and Internet Explorer. RFC 2109 was superseded by RFC 2965 in October 2000. RFC 2965 added a \`Set-Cookie2\` header, which informally came to be called \\"RFC 2965-style cookies\\" as opposed to the original \`Set-Cookie\` header which was called \\"Netscape-style cookies\\".The edbrowse documentation version 3.5 said \\"Note that only Netscape-style cookies are supported. However, this is the most common flavor of cookie. It will probably meet your needs.\\" This paragraph was removed in later versions of the documentation further to RFC 2965's deprecation. \`Set-Cookie2\` was seldom used however, and was deprecated in RFC 6265 in April 2011 which was written as a definitive specification for cookies as used in the real world. Terminology =Session cookie= A session cookie, also known as an in-memory cookie, transient cookie or non-persistent cookie, exists only in temporary memory while the user navigates the website.Microsoft Support Description of Persistent and Per-Session Cookies in Internet Explorer Article ID 223799, 2007 Web browsers normally delete session cookies when the user closes the browser. Unlike other cookies, session cookies do not have an expiration date assigned to them, which is how the browser knows to treat them as session cookies. =Persistent cookie= Instead of expiring when the web browser is closed as session cookies do, a persistent cookie expires at a specific date or after a specific length of time. This means that, for the cookie's entire lifespan (which can be as long or as short as its creators want), its information will be transmitted to the server every time the user visits the website that it belongs to, or every time the user views a resource belonging to that website from another website (such as an advertisement). For this reason, persistent cookies are sometimes referred to as tracking cookies because they can be used by advertisers to record information about a user's web browsing habits over an extended period of time. However, they are also used for \\"legitimate\\" reasons (such as keeping users logged into their accounts on websites, to avoid re-entering login credentials at every visit). =Secure cookie= A secure cookie can only be transmitted over an encrypted connection (i.e. HTTPS). They cannot be transmitted over unencrypted connections (i.e. HTTP). This makes the cookie less likely to be exposed to cookie theft via eavesdropping. A cookie is made secure by adding the \`Secure\` flag to the cookie. =Http-only cookie= An http-only cookie cannot be accessed by client-side APIs, such as JavaScript. This restriction eliminates the threat of cookie theft via cross-site scripting (XSS). However, the cookie remains vulnerable to cross-site tracing (XST) and cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks. A cookie is given this characteristic by adding the \`HttpOnly\` flag to the cookie. =Same-site cookie= In 2016 Google Chrome version 51 introduced a new kind of cookie with attribute \`SameSite\`. Attribute \`SameSite\` can have a value of \`Strict\`, \`Lax\` or \`None\`. With attribute \`SameSite=Strict\`, the browsers should only send these cookies with requests originated from the same domain/site as the target domain. This would effectively mitigate cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks.https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/same-site-cookie- attribute-prevent-cross-site-request-forgery/ \`SameSite=Lax\` would not restrict originating site, but enforce target domain to be the same as cookie domain, effectively blocking third-party (cross-site) cookies. Attribute \`SameSite=None\` would allow third-party (cross-site) cookies. The Same-site cookie is incorporated into a new RFC draft for \\"Cookies: HTTP State Management Mechanism\\" to update RFC6265 (if approved). Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge all started to support Same-site cookies.https://www.lambdatest.com/SameSite-cookie-attribute The key of rollout is the treatment of existing cookies without SameSite attribute defined, Chrome has been treating those existing cookies as if SameSite=None, this would keep all website/applications run as before. Google intended to change that default to SameSite=Lax in February 2020https://blog.chromium.org/2020/02/samesite-cookie-changes-in- february.html, the change would break those applications/websites if they reply on third-party/cross-site cookies, but without SameSite attribute defined. Given the extensive changes for web developers and COVID-19 circumstances, Google temporarily rolled back the SameSite cookie change.https://blog.chromium.org/2020/04/temporarily-rolling-back- samesite.html =Third-party cookie= Normally, a cookie's domain attribute will match the domain that is shown in the web browser's address bar. This is called a first-party cookie. A third-party cookie, however, belongs to a domain different from the one shown in the address bar. This sort of cookie typically appears when web pages feature content from external websites, such as banner advertisements. This opens up the potential for tracking the user's browsing history and is often used by advertisers in an effort to serve relevant advertisements to each user. As an example, suppose a user visits \`www.example.org\`. This website contains an advertisement from \`ad.foxytracking.com\`, which, when downloaded, sets a cookie belonging to the advertisement's domain (\`ad.foxytracking.com\`). Then, the user visits another website, \`www.foo.com\`, which also contains an advertisement from \`ad.foxytracking.com\` and sets a cookie belonging to that domain (\`ad.foxytracking.com\`). Eventually, both of these cookies will be sent to the advertiser when loading their advertisements or visiting their website. The advertiser can then use these cookies to build up a browsing history of the user across all the websites that have ads from this advertiser, through the use of the HTTP referer header field. , some websites were setting cookies readable for over 100 third-party domains. On average, a single website was setting 10 cookies, with a maximum number of cookies (first- and third-party) reaching over 800. Most modern web browsers contain privacy settings that can block third-party cookies. Google Chrome introduced new features to block third-party cookies. Henceforth, they are now blocked by default in Incognito mode, while a user can choose to block them in the normal browsing mode too. The update also added an option to block first-party cookie too. Some browsers block third-party cookies. As of July 2020, Apple Safari, Firefox, and Brave, block all third-party cookies by default. Safari allows embedded sites to use Storage Access API to request permission to set first-party cookies. Chrome plans to start blocking third-party cookies by 2022. =Supercookie= A supercookie is a cookie with an origin of a top-level domain (such as \`.com\`) or a public suffix (such as \`.co.uk\`). Ordinary cookies, by contrast, have an origin of a specific domain name, such as \`example.com\`. Supercookies can be a potential security concern and are therefore often blocked by web browsers. If unblocked by the browser, an attacker in control of a malicious website could set a supercookie and potentially disrupt or impersonate legitimate user requests to another website that shares the same top-level domain or public suffix as the malicious website. For example, a supercookie with an origin of \`.com\`, could maliciously affect a request made to \`example.com\`, even if the cookie did not originate from \`example.com\`. This can be used to fake logins or change user information. The Public Suffix List helps to mitigate the risk that supercookies pose. The Public Suffix List is a cross-vendor initiative that aims to provide an accurate and up-to-date list of domain name suffixes. Older versions of browsers may not have an up-to-date list, and will therefore be vulnerable to supercookies from certain domains. Other uses The term \\"supercookie\\" is sometimes used for tracking technologies that do not rely on HTTP cookies. Two such \\"supercookie\\" mechanisms were found on Microsoft websites in August 2011: cookie syncing that respawned MUID (machine unique identifier) cookies, and ETag cookies. Due to media attention, Microsoft later disabled this code. =Zombie cookie= A zombie cookie is a cookie that is automatically recreated after being deleted. This is accomplished by storing the cookie's content in multiple locations, such as Flash Local shared object, HTML5 Web storage, and other client-side and even server-side locations. When the cookie's absence is detected, the cookie is recreated using the data stored in these locations. Structure A cookie consists of the following components:Jim Manico quoting Daniel Stenberg, Real world cookie length limits # Name # Value # Zero or more attributes (name/value pairs). Attributes store information such as the cookie's expiration, domain, and flags (such as \`Secure\` and \`HttpOnly\`). Uses =Session management= Cookies were originally introduced to provide a way for users to record items they want to purchase as they navigate throughout a website (a virtual \\"shopping cart\\" or \\"shopping basket\\"). Today, however, the contents of a user's shopping cart are usually stored in a database on the server, rather than in a cookie on the client. To keep track of which user is assigned to which shopping cart, the server sends a cookie to the client that contains a unique session identifier (typically, a long string of random letters and numbers). Because cookies are sent to the server with every request the client makes, that session identifier will be sent back to the server every time the user visits a new page on the website, which lets the server know which shopping cart to display to the user. Another popular use of cookies is for logging into websites. When the user visits a website's login page, the web server typically sends the client a cookie containing a unique session identifier. When the user successfully logs in, the server remembers that that particular session identifier has been authenticated and grants the user access to its services. Because session cookies only contain a unique session identifier, this makes the amount of personal information that a website can save about each user virtually limitless‚Äîthe website is not limited to restrictions concerning how large a cookie can be. Session cookies also help to improve page load times, since the amount of information in a session cookie is small and requires little bandwidth. =Personalization= Cookies can be used to remember information about the user in order to show relevant content to that user over time. For example, a web server might send a cookie containing the username that was last used to log into a website, so that it may be filled in automatically the next time the user logs in. Many websites use cookies for personalization based on the user's preferences. Users select their preferences by entering them in a web form and submitting the form to the server. The server encodes the preferences in a cookie and sends the cookie back to the browser. This way, every time the user accesses a page on the website, the server can personalize the page according to the user's preferences. For example, the Google search engine once used cookies to allow users (even non-registered ones) to decide how many search results per page they wanted to see. Also, DuckDuckGo uses cookies to allow users to set the viewing preferences like colors of the web page. =Tracking= Tracking cookies are used to track users' web browsing habits. This can also be done to some extent by using the IP address of the computer requesting the page or the referer field of the HTTP request header, but cookies allow for greater precision. This can be demonstrated as follows: # If the user requests a page of the site, but the request contains no cookie, the server presumes that this is the first page visited by the user. So the server creates a unique identifier (typically a string of random letters and numbers) and sends it as a cookie back to the browser together with the requested page. # From this point on, the cookie will automatically be sent by the browser to the server every time a new page from the site is requested. The server not only sends the page as usual but also stores the URL of the requested page, the date/time of the request, and the cookie in a log file. By analyzing this log file, it is then possible to find out which pages the user has visited, in what sequence, and for how long. Corporations exploit users' web habits by tracking cookies to collect information about buying habits. The Wall Street Journal found that America's top fifty websites installed an average of sixty-four pieces of tracking technology onto computers, resulting in a total of 3,180 tracking files.Rainie, Lee (2012). Networked: The New Social Operating System. p. 237 The data can then be collected and sold to bidding corporations. Implementation A possible interaction between a web browser and a web server holding a web page in which the server sends a cookie to the browser and the browser sends it back when requesting another page. Cookies are arbitrary pieces of data, usually chosen and first sent by the web server, and stored on the client computer by the web browser. The browser then sends them back to the server with every request, introducing states (memory of previous events) into otherwise stateless HTTP transactions. Without cookies, each retrieval of a web page or component of a web page would be an isolated event, largely unrelated to all other page views made by the user on the website. Although cookies are usually set by the web server, they can also be set by the client using a scripting language such as JavaScript (unless the cookie's \`HttpOnly\` flag is set, in which case the cookie cannot be modified by scripting languages). The cookie specificationsIETF HTTP State Management Mechanism, Apr, 2011 Obsoletes RFC 2965 require that browsers meet the following requirements in order to support cookies: * Can support cookies as large as 4,096 bytes in size. * Can support at least 50 cookies per domain (i.e. per website). * Can support at least 3,000 cookies in total. =Setting a cookie= Cookies are set using the \`Set-Cookie\` HTTP header, sent in an HTTP response from the web server. This header instructs the web browser to store the cookie and send it back in future requests to the server (the browser will ignore this header if it does not support cookies or has disabled cookies). As an example, the browser sends its first request for the homepage of the \`www.example.org\` website: GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.org ... The server responds with two \`Set-Cookie\` headers: HTTP/1.0 200 OK Content-type: text/html Set-Cookie: theme=light Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT ... The server's HTTP response contains the contents of the website's homepage. But it also instructs the browser to set two cookies. The first, \\"theme\\", is considered to be a session cookie since it does not have an \`Expires\` or \`Max-Age\` attribute. Session cookies are intended to be deleted by the browser when the browser closes. The second, \\"sessionToken\\", is considered to be a persistent cookie since it contains an \`Expires\` attribute, which instructs the browser to delete the cookie at a specific date and time. Next, the browser sends another request to visit the \`spec.html\` page on the website. This request contains a \`Cookie\` HTTP header, which contains the two cookies that the server instructed the browser to set: GET /spec.html HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.org Cookie: theme=light; sessionToken=abc123 ‚Ä¶ This way, the server knows that this request is related to the previous one. The server would answer by sending the requested page, possibly including more \`Set- Cookie\` headers in the response in order to add new cookies, modify existing cookies, or delete cookies. The value of a cookie can be modified by the server by including a \`Set-Cookie\` header in response to a page request. The browser then replaces the old value with the new value. The value of a cookie may consist of any printable ASCII character (\`!\` through \`~\`, Unicode \`\\\\u0021\` through \`\\\\u007E\`) excluding \`,\` and \`;\` and whitespace characters. The name of a cookie excludes the same characters, as well as \`=\`, since that is the delimiter between the name and value. The cookie standard RFC 2965 is more restrictive but not implemented by browsers. The term \\"cookie crumb\\" is sometimes used to refer to a cookie's name‚Äìvalue pair. Cookies can also be set by scripting languages such as JavaScript that run within the browser. In JavaScript, the object \`document.cookie\` is used for this purpose. For example, the instruction \`document.cookie = \\"temperature=20\\"\` creates a cookie of name \\"temperature\\" and value \\"20\\". =Cookie attributes= In addition to a name and value, cookies can also have one or more attributes. Browsers do not include cookie attributes in requests to the server‚Äîthey only send the cookie's name and value. Cookie attributes are used by browsers to determine when to delete a cookie, block a cookie or whether to send a cookie to the server. Domain and path The \`Domain\` and \`Path\` attributes define the scope of the cookie. They essentially tell the browser what website the cookie belongs to. For obvious security reasons, cookies can only be set on the current resource's top domain and its sub domains, and not for another domain and its sub domains. For example, the website \`example.org\` cannot set a cookie that has a domain of \`foo.com\` because this would allow the \`example.org\` website to control the cookies of \`foo.com\`. If a cookie's \`Domain\` and \`Path\` attributes are not specified by the server, they default to the domain and path of the resource that was requested. However, in most browsers there is a difference between a cookie set from \`foo.com\` without a domain, and a cookie set with the \`foo.com\` domain. In the former case, the cookie will only be sent for requests to \`foo.com\`, also known as a host-only cookie. In the latter case, all sub domains are also included (for example, \`docs.foo.com\`). A notable exception to this general rule is Edge prior to Windows 10 RS3 and Internet Explorer prior to IE 11 and Windows 10 RS4 (April 2018), which always send cookies to sub domains regardless of whether the cookie was set with or without a domain. Below is an example of some \`Set- Cookie\` HTTP response headers that are sent from a website after a user logged in. The HTTP request was sent to a webpage within the \`docs.foo.com\` subdomain: HTTP/1.0 200 OK Set-Cookie: LSID=DQAAAK‚Ä¶Eaem_vYg; Path=/accounts; Expires=Wed, 13 Jan 2021 22:23:01 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly Set-Cookie: HSID=AYQEVn‚Ä¶DKrdst; Domain=.foo.com; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 13 Jan 2021 22:23:01 GMT; HttpOnly Set-Cookie: SSID=Ap4P‚Ä¶GTEq; Domain=foo.com; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 13 Jan 2021 22:23:01 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly ‚Ä¶ The first cookie, \`LSID\`, has no \`Domain\` attribute, and has a \`Path\` attribute set to \`/accounts\`. This tells the browser to use the cookie only when requesting pages contained in \`docs.foo.com/accounts\` (the domain is derived from the request domain). The other two cookies, \`HSID\` and \`SSID\`, would be used when the browser requests any subdomain in \`.foo.com\` on any path (for example \`www.foo.com/bar\`). The prepending dot is optional in recent standards, but can be added for compatibility with RFC 2109 based implementations. Expires and Max-Age The \`Expires\` attribute defines a specific date and time for when the browser should delete the cookie. The date and time are specified in the form \`Wdy, DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT\`, or in the form \`Wdy, DD Mon YY HH:MM:SS GMT\` for values of YY where YY is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 69. Alternatively, the \`Max-Age\` attribute can be used to set the cookie's expiration as an interval of seconds in the future, relative to the time the browser received the cookie. Below is an example of three \`Set-Cookie\` headers that were received from a website after a user logged in: HTTP/1.0 200 OK Set-Cookie: lu=Rg3vHJZnehYLjVg7qi3bZjzg; Expires=Tue, 15 Jan 2013 21:47:38 GMT; Path=/; Domain=.example.com; HttpOnly Set-Cookie: made_write_conn=1295214458; Path=/; Domain=.example.com Set-Cookie: reg_fb_gate=deleted; Expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT; Path=/; Domain=.example.com; HttpOnly The first cookie, \`lu\`, is set to expire sometime on 15 January 2013. It will be used by the client browser until that time. The second cookie, \`made_write_conn\`, does not have an expiration date, making it a session cookie. It will be deleted after the user closes their browser. The third cookie, \`reg_fb_gate\`, has its value changed to \\"deleted\\", with an expiration time in the past. The browser will delete this cookie right away because its expiration time is in the past. Note that cookie will only be deleted if the domain and path attributes in the \`Set-Cookie\` field match the values used when the cookie was created. Internet Explorer did not support \`Max-Age\`. Secure and HttpOnly The \`Secure\` and \`HttpOnly\` attributes do not have associated values. Rather, the presence of just their attribute names indicates that their behaviors should be enabled. The \`Secure\` attribute is meant to keep cookie communication limited to encrypted transmission, directing browsers to use cookies only via secure/encrypted connections. However, if a web server sets a cookie with a secure attribute from a non- secure connection, the cookie can still be intercepted when it is sent to the user by man-in-the-middle attacks. Therefore, for maximum security, cookies with the Secure attribute should only be set over a secure connection. The \`HttpOnly\` attribute directs browsers not to expose cookies through channels other than HTTP (and HTTPS) requests. This means that the cookie cannot be accessed via client-side scripting languages (notably JavaScript), and therefore cannot be stolen easily via cross-site scripting (a pervasive attack technique). Browser settings Most modern browsers support cookies and allow the user to disable them. The following are common options: * To enable or disable cookies completely, so that they are always accepted or always blocked. * To view and selectively delete cookies using a cookie manager. * To fully wipe all private data, including cookies. By default, Internet Explorer allows third-party cookies only if they are accompanied by a P3P \\"CP\\" (Compact Policy) field. Add-on tools for managing cookie permissions also exist. Privacy and third-party cookies Cookies have some important implications on the privacy and anonymity of web users. While cookies are sent only to the server setting them or a server in the same Internet domain, a web page may contain images or other components stored on servers in other domains. Cookies that are set during retrieval of these components are called third-party cookies. The older standards for cookies, RFC 2109 and RFC 2965, specify that browsers should protect user privacy and not allow sharing of cookies between servers by default. However, the newer standard, RFC 6265, explicitly allows user agents to implement whichever third-party cookie policy they wish. Most browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Google Chrome, do allow third-party cookies by default, as long as the third-party website has Compact Privacy Policy published. Newer versions of Safari block third-party cookies, and this is planned for Mozilla Firefox as well (initially planned for version 22 but postponed indefinitely). In this fictional example, an advertising company has placed banners in two websites. By hosting the banner images on its servers and using third-party cookies, the advertising company is able to track the browsing of users across these two sites. Advertising companies use third-party cookies to track a user across multiple sites. In particular, an advertising company can track a user across all pages where it has placed advertising images or web bugs. Knowledge of the pages visited by a user allows the advertising company to target advertisements to the user's presumed preferences. Website operators who do not disclose third-party cookie use to consumers run the risk of harming consumer trust if cookie use is discovered. Having clear disclosure (such as in a privacy policy) tends to eliminate any negative effects of such cookie discovery.Miyazaki, Anthony D. (2008), \\"Online Privacy and the Disclosure of Cookie Use: Effects on Consumer Trust and Anticipated Patronage,\\" Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 23 (Spring), 19‚Äì33 The possibility of building a profile of users is a privacy threat, especially when tracking is done across multiple domains using third-party cookies. For this reason, some countries have legislation about cookies. The United States government has set strict rules on setting cookies in 2000 after it was disclosed that the White House drug policy office used cookies to track computer users viewing its online anti-drug advertising. In 2002, privacy activist Daniel Brandt found that the CIA had been leaving persistent cookies on computers that had visited its website. When notified it was violating policy, CIA stated that these cookies were not intentionally set and stopped setting them. On December 25, 2005, Brandt discovered that the National Security Agency (NSA) had been leaving two persistent cookies on visitors' computers due to a software upgrade. After being informed, the NSA immediately disabled the cookies. =EU cookie directive= In 2002, the European Union launched the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications, a policy requiring end users' consent for the placement of cookies, and similar technologies for storing and accessing information on users' equipment. In particular, Article 5 Paragraph 3 mandates that storing data in a user's computer can only be done if the user is provided information about how this data is used, and the user is given the possibility of denying this storing operation. Directive 95/46/EC defines \\"the data subject's consent\\" as \\"any freely given specific and informed indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed.\\" Consent must involve some form of communication where individuals knowingly indicate their acceptance. In 2009, the policy was amended by Directive 2009/136/EC, which included a change to Article 5, Paragraph 3. Instead of having an option for users to opt out of cookie storage, the revised Directive requires consent to be obtained for cookie storage. In June 2012, European data protection authorities adopted an opinion which clarifies that some cookie users might be exempt from the requirement to gain consent: * Some cookies can be exempted from informed consent under certain conditions if they are not used for additional purposes. These cookies include cookies used to keep track of a user's input when filling online forms or as a shopping cart. * First-party analytics cookies are not likely to create a privacy risk if websites provide clear information about the cookies to users and privacy safeguards. The industry's response has been largely negative. Robert Bond of the law firm Speechly Bircham describes the effects as \\"far-reaching and incredibly onerous\\" for \\"all UK companies\\". Simon Davis of Privacy International argues that proper enforcement would \\"destroy the entire industry\\". The P3P specification offers a possibility for a server to state a privacy policy using an HTTP header, which specifies which kind of information it collects and for which purpose. These policies include (but are not limited to) the use of information gathered using cookies. According to the P3P specification, a browser can accept or reject cookies by comparing the privacy policy with the stored user preferences or ask the user, presenting them the privacy policy as declared by the server. However, the P3P specification was criticized by web developers for its complexity. Some websites do not correctly implement it. For example, Facebook jokingly used \\"HONK\\" as its P3P header for a period. Only Internet Explorer provides adequate support for the specification. Third-party cookies can be blocked by most browsers to increase privacy and reduce tracking by advertising and tracking companies without negatively affecting the user's web experience. Many advertising operators have an opt-out option to behavioural advertising, with a generic cookie in the browser stopping behavioural advertising. Cookie theft and session hijacking Most websites use cookies as the only identifiers for user sessions, because other methods of identifying web users have limitations and vulnerabilities. If a website uses cookies as session identifiers, attackers can impersonate users' requests by stealing a full set of victims' cookies. From the web server's point of view, a request from an attacker then has the same authentication as the victim's requests; thus the request is performed on behalf of the victim's session. Listed here are various scenarios of cookie theft and user session hijacking (even without stealing user cookies) that work with websites relying solely on HTTP cookies for user identification. =Network eavesdropping= A cookie can be stolen by another computer that is allowed reading from the network Traffic on a network can be intercepted and read by computers on the network other than the sender and receiver (particularly over unencrypted open Wi-Fi). This traffic includes cookies sent on ordinary unencrypted HTTP sessions. Where network traffic is not encrypted, attackers can therefore read the communications of other users on the network, including HTTP cookies as well as the entire contents of the conversations, for the purpose of a man-in-the-middle attack. An attacker could use intercepted cookies to impersonate a user and perform a malicious task, such as transferring money out of the victim's bank account. This issue can be resolved by securing the communication between the user's computer and the server by employing Transport Layer Security (HTTPS protocol) to encrypt the connection. A server can specify the \`Secure\` flag while setting a cookie, which will cause the browser to send the cookie only over an encrypted channel, such as an TLS connection. =Publishing false sub-domain: DNS cache poisoning= If an attacker is able to cause a DNS server to cache a fabricated DNS entry (called DNS cache poisoning), then this could allow the attacker to gain access to a user's cookies. For example, an attacker could use DNS cache poisoning to create a fabricated DNS entry of \`f12345.www.example.com\` that points to the IP address of the attacker's server. The attacker can then post an image URL from his own server (for example, \`http://f12345.www.example.com/img_4_cookie.jpg\`). Victims reading the attacker's message would download this image from \`f12345.www.example.com\`. Since \`f12345.www.example.com\` is a sub-domain of \`www.example.com\`, victims' browsers would submit all \`example.com\`-related cookies to the attacker's server. If an attacker is able to accomplish this, it is usually the fault of the Internet Service Providers for not properly securing their DNS servers. However, the severity of this attack can be lessened if the target website uses secure cookies. In this case, the attacker would have the extra challengeWired Hack Obtains 9 Bogus Certificates for Prominent Websites of obtaining the target website's TLS certificate from a certificate authority, since secure cookies can only be transmitted over an encrypted connection. Without a matching TLS certificate, victims' browsers would display a warning message about the attacker's invalid certificate, which would help deter users from visiting the attacker's fraudulent website and sending the attacker their cookies. =Cross-site scripting: cookie theft= Cookies can also be stolen using a technique called cross-site scripting. This occurs when an attacker takes advantage of a website that allows its users to post unfiltered HTML and JavaScript content. By posting malicious HTML and JavaScript code, the attacker can cause the victim's web browser to send the victim's cookies to a website the attacker controls. As an example, an attacker may post a message on \`www.example.com\` with the following link: Click here! Cross-site scripting: a cookie that should be only exchanged between a server and a client is sent to another party. When another user clicks on this link, the browser executes the piece of code within the \`onclick\` attribute, thus replacing the string \`document.cookie\` with the list of cookies that are accessible from the current page. As a result, this list of cookies is sent to the \`attacker.com\` server. If the attacker's malicious posting is on an HTTPS website \`https://www.example.com\`, secure cookies will also be sent to attacker.com in plain text. It is the responsibility of the website developers to filter out such malicious code. Such attacks can be mitigated by using HttpOnly cookies. These cookies will not be accessible by client-side scripting languages like JavaScript, and therefore, the attacker will not be able to gather these cookies. =Cross- site scripting: proxy request= In older versions of many browsers, there were security holes in the implementation of the XMLHttpRequest API. This API allows pages to specify a proxy server that would get the reply, and this proxy server is not subject to the same-origin policy. For example, a victim is reading an attacker's posting on \`www.example.com\`, and the attacker's script is executed in the victim's browser. The script generates a request to \`www.example.com\` with the proxy server \`attacker.com\`. Since the request is for \`www.example.com\`, all \`example.com\` cookies will be sent along with the request, but routed through the attacker's proxy server. Hence, the attacker would be able to harvest the victim's cookies. This attack would not work with secure cookies, since they can only be transmitted over HTTPS connections, and the HTTPS protocol dictates end-to-end encryption (i.e. the information is encrypted on the user's browser and decrypted on the destination server). In this case, the proxy server would only see the raw, encrypted bytes of the HTTP request. =Cross-site request forgery= For example, Bob might be browsing a chat forum where another user, Mallory, has posted a message. Suppose that Mallory has crafted an HTML image element that references an action on Bob's bank's website (rather than an image file), e.g., ![](http://bank.example.com/withdraw?account=bob&amount=1000000&for=mallory) If Bob's bank keeps his authentication information in a cookie, and if the cookie hasn't expired, then the attempt by Bob's browser to load the image will submit the withdrawal form with his cookie, thus authorizing a transaction without Bob's approval. =Cookiejacking= Cookiejacking is a form of hacking wherein an attacker can gain access to session cookies of an Internet Explorer user. Discovered by Rosario Valotta, an Internet security researcher, the exploit allows an attacker to obtain a cookie from any site and thus a username and password by tricking a user into dragging an object across the screen. Although Microsoft deemed the flaw low-risk because of \\"the level of required user interaction\\", and the necessity of having a user already logged into the website whose cookie is stolen, Valotta was able to use a social engineering attack to obtain, in three days, the cookies of 80 Facebook users out of his 150 friends. Drawbacks of cookies Besides privacy concerns, cookies also have some technical drawbacks. In particular, they do not always accurately identify users, they can be used for security attacks, and they are often at odds with the Representational State Transfer (REST) software architectural style. =Inaccurate identification= If more than one browser is used on a computer, each usually has a separate storage area for cookies. Hence, cookies do not identify a person, but a combination of a user account, a computer, and a web browser. Thus, anyone who uses multiple accounts, computers, or browsers has multiple sets of cookies. Likewise, cookies do not differentiate between multiple users who share the same user account, computer, and browser. =Inconsistent state on client and server= The use of cookies may generate an inconsistency between the state of the client and the state as stored in the cookie. If the user acquires a cookie and then clicks the \\"Back\\" button of the browser, the state on the browser is generally not the same as before that acquisition. As an example, if the shopping cart of an online shop is built using cookies, the content of the cart may not change when the user goes back in the browser's history: if the user presses a button to add an item in the shopping cart and then clicks on the \\"Back\\" button, the item remains in the shopping cart. This might not be the intention of the user, who possibly wanted to undo the addition of the item. This can lead to unreliability, confusion, and bugs. Web developers should therefore be aware of this issue and implement measures to handle such situations. Alternatives to cookies Some of the operations that can be done using cookies can also be done using other mechanisms. =JSON Web Tokens= A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a self-contained packet of information that can be used to store user identity and authenticity information. This allows them to be used in place of session cookies. Unlike cookies, which are automatically attached to each HTTP request by the browser, JWTs must be explicitly attached to each HTTP request by the web application. =HTTP authentication= The HTTP protocol includes the basic access authentication and the digest access authentication protocols, which allow access to a web page only when the user has provided the correct username and password. If the server requires such credentials for granting access to a web page, the browser requests them from the user and, once obtained, the browser stores and sends them in every subsequent page request. This information can be used to track the user. =IP address= Some users may be tracked based on the IP address of the computer requesting the page. The server knows the IP address of the computer running the browser (or the proxy, if any is used) and could theoretically link a user's session to this IP address. However, IP addresses are generally not a reliable way to track a session or identify a user. Many computers designed to be used by a single user, such as office PCs or home PCs, are behind a network address translator (NAT). This means that several PCs will share a public IP address. Furthermore, some systems, such as Tor, are designed to retain Internet anonymity, rendering tracking by IP address impractical, impossible, or a security risk. =URL (query string)= A more precise technique is based on embedding information into URLs. The query string part of the URL is the part that is typically used for this purpose, but other parts can be used as well. The Java Servlet and PHP session mechanisms both use this method if cookies are not enabled. This method consists of the web server appending query strings containing a unique session identifier to all the links inside of a web page. When the user follows a link, the browser sends the query string to the server, allowing the server to identify the user and maintain state. These kinds of query strings are very similar to cookies in that both contain arbitrary pieces of information chosen by the server and both are sent back to the server on every request. However, there are some differences. Since a query string is part of a URL, if that URL is later reused, the same attached piece of information will be sent to the server, which could lead to confusion. For example, if the preferences of a user are encoded in the query string of a URL and the user sends this URL to another user by e-mail, those preferences will be used for that other user as well. Moreover, if the same user accesses the same page multiple times from different sources, there is no guarantee that the same query string will be used each time. For example, if a user visits a page by coming from a page internal to the site the first time, and then visits the same page by coming from an external search engine the second time, the query strings would likely be different. If cookies were used in this situation, the cookies would be the same. Other drawbacks of query strings are related to security. Storing data that identifies a session in a query string enables session fixation attacks, referer logging attacks and other security exploits. Transferring session identifiers as HTTP cookies is more secure. =Hidden form fields= Another form of session tracking is to use web forms with hidden fields. This technique is very similar to using URL query strings to hold the information and has many of the same advantages and drawbacks. In fact, if the form is handled with the HTTP GET method, then this technique is similar to using URL query strings, since the GET method adds the form fields to the URL as a query string. But most forms are handled with HTTP POST, which causes the form information, including the hidden fields, to be sent in the HTTP request body, which is neither part of the URL, nor of a cookie. This approach presents two advantages from the point of view of the tracker. First, having the tracking information placed in the HTTP request body rather than in the URL means it will not be noticed by the average user. Second, the session information is not copied when the user copies the URL (to bookmark the page or send it via email, for example). =\\"window.name\\" DOM property= All current web browsers can store a fairly large amount of data (2‚Äì32 MB) via JavaScript using the DOM property \`window.name\`. This data can be used instead of session cookies and is also cross-domain. The technique can be coupled with JSON/JavaScript objects to store complex sets of session variables on the client side. The downside is that every separate window or tab will initially have an empty \`window.name\` property when opened. Furthermore, the property can be used for tracking visitors across different websites, making it of concern for Internet privacy. In some respects, this can be more secure than cookies due to the fact that its contents are not automatically sent to the server on every request like cookies are, so it is not vulnerable to network cookie sniffing attacks. However, if special measures are not taken to protect the data, it is vulnerable to other attacks because the data is available across different websites opened in the same window or tab. =Identifier for advertisers= Apple uses a tracking technique called \\"identifier for advertisers\\" (IDFA). This technique assigns a unique identifier to every user who buys an Apple iOS device (such as an iPhone or iPad). This identifier is then used by Apple's advertising network, iAd, to determine the ads that individuals are viewing and responding to. =ETag= Because ETags are cached by the browser, and returned with subsequent requests for the same resource, a tracking server can simply repeat any ETag received from the browser to ensure an assigned ETag persists indefinitely (in a similar way to persistent cookies). Additional caching headers can also enhance the preservation of ETag data. ETags can be flushed in some browsers by clearing the browser cache. =Web storage= Some web browsers support persistence mechanisms which allow the page to store the information locally for later use. The HTML5 standard (which most modern web browsers support to some extent) includes a JavaScript API called Web storage that allows two types of storage: local storage and session storage. Local storage behaves similarly to persistent cookies while session storage behaves similarly to session cookies, except that session storage is tied to an individual tab/window's lifetime (AKA a page session), not to a whole browser session like session cookies. Internet Explorer supports persistent information in the browser's history, in the browser's favorites, in an XML store (\\"user data\\"), or directly within a web page saved to disk. Some web browser plugins include persistence mechanisms as well. For example, Adobe Flash has Local shared object and Microsoft Silverlight has Isolated storage. =Browser cache= The browser cache can also be used to store information that can be used to track individual users. This technique takes advantage of the fact that the web browser will use resources stored within the cache instead of downloading them from the website when it determines that the cache already has the most up-to-date version of the resource. For example, a website could serve a JavaScript file with code that sets a unique identifier for the user (for example, \`var userId = 3243242;\`). After the user's initial visit, every time the user accesses the page, this file will be loaded from the cache instead of downloaded from the server. Thus, its content will never change. =Browser fingerprint= A browser fingerprint is information collected about a browser's configuration, such as version number, screen resolution, and operating system, for the purpose of identification. Fingerprints can be used to fully or partially identify individual users or devices even when cookies are turned off. Basic web browser configuration information has long been collected by web analytics services in an effort to accurately measure real human web traffic and discount various forms of click fraud. With the assistance of client-side scripting languages, collection of much more esoteric parameters is possible. Assimilation of such information into a single string comprises a device fingerprint. In 2010, EFF measured at least 18.1 bits of entropy possible from browser fingerprinting. Canvas fingerprinting, a more recent technique, claims to add another 5.7 bits.

It has been described as the \\"most well-known national dish of Israel\\",Israel, Jill DuBois and Mair Rosh, Marshall Cavendish Pub., 2003 . p. 130\\"Jerusalem Diaries II: What's Really Happening in Israel, Judy Lash Balint. Published by Xulon Press, 2007. p. 259 and is a standard accompaniment to most Israeli meals. Salads following essentially the same recipe, with different names, are widespread and popular throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. It was adopted from local versions by Jewish immigrants to the Levant in the late 19th century. The name Israeli Salad is used mainly outside of Israel. In Israel, it is commonly referred to as salat katzutz (, \\"chopped salad\\"), as well as salat aravi (, \\"Arab salad\\"), or salat yerakot (, \\"vegetable salad\\"). Palestinians may call their traditional dish salatat al-bandura or salatat banadura (\\"tomato salad\\"),Farsoun, 2004, p. 138. or salata na'meh. Description Israeli salad is made of chopped raw tomato, onion and cucumber, and can also include pepper, carrot, scallion, leafy greens and parsley. The salad is dressed with either fresh lemon juice or olive oil, or both. Za'atar and yogurt are very common dressings at breakfast while sumac and tahini are common the rest of the day. Generally, the cucumbers are not peeled. The ability to chop the tomatoes and cucumbers into the \\"finest, most perfect dice\\" is considered a mark of status among many kibbutz cooks.Mouth Wide Open: A Cook and His Appetite, John Thorne, Tor/Forge, 2007, p. 190 Traditional recipes do not include lettuce. In Israeli restaurants and cafes, Israeli salad is served as an independent side dish, as an accompaniment to main dishes, or stuffed in a pita with falafel or shawarma. It was part of the traditional Israeli breakfast at home before Western-style breakfast cereals became popular, and remains a standard feature at buffet breakfasts at Israeli hotels, as well as in many homes. History Although cucumbers have an ancient history in the Middle East, tomatoes, native to South America, were not cultivated in the Syria region until possibly as late as the 19th century, during the Ottoman Empire. The origins of the Israeli salad are traced by Gil Hovav, Israeli food editor and chef, to a Palestinian Arab salad. He states that, \\"this salad that we call an Israeli Salad, actually it‚Äôs an Arab salad, Palestinian salad‚Ä¶.‚Äù\\"This salad that we call an Israeli salad, actually it's an Arab salad, Palestinian salad.\\" BBC Cooking in the Danger Zone: Israel and Palestinian Territories, Page 6 The idea that what is known in New York delis as \\"Israeli salad\\" stems from a Palestinian rural salad is also agreed on by Joseph Massad, a Palestinian professor of Arab Politics at Columbia University, as an example of the appropriation of Palestinian and pan-Syrian foods such as hummus, falafel, and tabbouleh by Israel as \\"national dishes\\".Joseph Massad, \\"The Persistence of the Palestinian Question,\\" in Empire & Terror: Nationalism/postnationalism in the New Millennium, Bego√±a Aretxaga, University of Nevada, Reno Center for Basque Studies, University of Nevada Press, 2005 p. 63 Food historian Gil Marks describes how Jewish immigrants in the late 19th century first encountered the cucumber and tomato salad in then-Ottoman Palestine, and traces its presence there back to the Turkish √ßoban salatasƒ± (shepherd's salad). Adopted and popularized in Israel by the kibbutzim, variations on the basic recipe have been made by the different Jewish communities that immigrated to the country. For example, Jews from India prepare it with the addition of finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.Roden, Claudia, The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York, New York, Knopf (1997) , pg. 248 Other similar chopped salads found in the Middle East, include the Persian salad shirazi ÿ≥ÿßŸÑÿßÿØ ÿ¥Ÿäÿ±ÿßÿ≤Ÿä (which includes mint, diced onions, and peeled cucumbers),Authentic Iranian recipe for Salad-e Shirazi and the Turkish √ßoban salatasƒ±; among others found throughout the eastern Mediterranean area in Turkey, Lebanon, and Egypt.Houston Chronicle: Dice up a staple salad dish The Indian subcontinent cuisine also includes a variant of this salad, called \\"kachumber\\".http://chefinyou.com/2010/06/kachumber-recipe/ See also * List of salads References Category:Salads Category:Israeli cuisine Category:Jewish cuisine Category:Levantine cuisine Category:Mediterranean cuisine Category:National dishes Category:Vegetable dishes Category:Vegan cuisine Category:Middle Eastern cuisine ","title":"Israeli salad"},{"id":"5068438","text":"Bryn Mawr School (BMS), founded in 1885 as the first college-preparatory school for girls in the United States, is an independent, nonsectarian all- girls school for grades K-12, with a coed preschool. Bryn Mawr School is located in the Roland Park community of Baltimore, Maryland, United States at 109 W. Melrose Avenue, Baltimore MD 21210. Bryn Mawr School Community In 2007‚Äì2008, Bryn Mawr had 117 faculty members, 61% of whom held advanced degrees. Student enrollment was 784 and the student to faculty ratio is 7:1. The average class size is 15. Boys are admitted only into the Pre-K division known as the Little School; however, students from Bryn Mawr's brother school may take classes once in Upper School. Each student in the Middle and Upper Schools is assigned an Advisor in her division who serves as her representative to the school. Advisory groups meet together throughout the week for discussions and celebrations, and work together on a variety of charitable and service projects.Experience Bryn Mawr Application for Admissions, The Bryn Mawr School, 2007. History The Bryn Mawr School for Girls of Baltimore City was founded in 1885 by five young Baltimore women, M. Carey Thomas, Mary Elizabeth Garrett, Mamie Gwinn, Bessie King, and Julia Rogers, collectively known as the \\"Friday Evening\\" Group, who sought to provide an education for girls equal to that available to boys. Their families were involved in the creation of the Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, of which M. Carey Thomas was to be first dean and later president. In her 1883 letter to James E. Rhoads (the first president of the college), M. Carey Thomas shared her concern for how they would find young women prepared for the unprecedented rigorous standards of the new college: \\"The absence of the regularly organized preparatory schools that exist for boys greatly embarrasses a girl who means to enter college.\\"Marjorie Housepian Dobkin, ed., The Making of a Feminist: Early Journals and Letters of M. Carey Thomas; Kent State University Press, Kent, Ohio; 1979. The school that these young women created in Baltimore was the first to offer only a college preparatory program. They set their standards high, insisting upon a well-educated faculty which was predominantly female and a curriculum that required Latin and French, German and Greek, laboratory sciences, history, literature, advanced mathematics, elocution, and art. The students underwent examinations by professors from leading universities including Johns Hopkins and Cornell, and to graduate had to pass the exceedingly difficult entrance exam for the Bryn Mawr College.Elizabeth Pokempner, '\\"Unusual Qualifications\\": Teachers at the Bryn Mawr School, 1885‚Äì1901\\" in Maryland Historical Magazine, Vol. 93, Issue 1 (Spring 1998), Baltimore, MD; pp. 77‚Äì87. Mary Elizabeth Garrett, who became the wealthiest ‚Äúspinster woman‚Äù in the country with the death of her father John Work Garrett, was the benefactress of this experiment in education. She was often onsite during the construction of a unique school building in downtown Baltimore from 1888 to 1890, which cost her the immense sum of $400,000. It featured an indoor swimming pool complete with cold ‚Äúneedle baths‚Äù, a gymnasium with suspended track and outfitted with the most modern gymnasium equipment from Sweden and the Sargent School of Boston, as well as a full-time physician to oversee the athletic and posture programs. Up the many flights of stairs were complete scientific laboratories, an art room flooded with natural light by skylights, and a library stocked with classics and modern literature as well as scientific and mathematical volumes. The large study hall bore a complete copy of the Parthenon Frieze and there were copies of European and American statuary and artwork throughout the building for the girls to study and draw. The building was so intriguing that a model of it was made for the Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago and numerous articles about it appeared in newspapers across the country. Women who had reached the highest levels of academic achievement wrote to the founders offering their support and enthusiasm, as well as recommendations for faculty from among their own students. The school was seen as a move forward for women's education reaching far beyond Baltimore and Pennsylvania.Unpublished letters, The Bryn Mawr School Papers of the M. Carey Thomas Collection, Bryn Mawr School Archives, Baltimore, MD. After a series of Secretaries who managed the daily running of the school, the Board of Managers brought Edith Hamilton from her doctoral studies in Europe to be the first Headmistress. A gifted graduate of the Bryn Mawr College and winner of the European Scholarship, Edith Hamilton guided the school for 26 years, from 1896‚Äì1922. Her love of learning was infectious and the girls worked hard to earn her praise; many later quoted her favorite from Plato, \\"Hard is the good\\". The school still bears the stamp of humanism and intellectual curiosity that she instilled. As the city became more congested and families moved out to the country, there was an urgent need to move the school as well. The property known as The Orchards was purchased in 1928 from the Gordon family north of the city line, and the school spent several years acquiring the funds to gradually move out of its home downtown and into renovated and new buildings in the country. The Depression and then the Second World War made it difficult to sell the former school building to the eventual buyers, the German Singing Societies, but the Alumnae and the Parents Associations worked dutifully to raise funds for the needs of modern education. Over the years buildings have been added as needed. The same stone that had been used to build the Gatehouse in the 19th century was found at the Butler quarry in Baltimore County and was used in the construction of Garrett (1931), Hamilton (1953), and the North Building (2007). Other structures built of complementary materials include Howell (1969) which houses the Upper School and the Edith Hamilton Library, Hardy (1969) for science and math, the Cafeteria (1948), Katherine Van Bibber Gymnasium (1959), the Lower School complex designed by Marcel Breuer (1972), Centennial Hall (1987), the Barbara Landis Chase Dance Studio (1992), the Lower School Science building (1996), the Admissions Cottage (1997), and a variety of small outbuildings and additions. Many of these structures have been recognized for excellence in design. Academics Coordination of classes with the adjacent boys' school at Gilman School and girls' school at Roland Park Country School at the Upper School level offers Bryn Mawr students a variety of electives and the opportunity for coeducational classes. These coordinated classes are concentrated in the junior and senior years. Most students take two years of Latin and three years of either French or Spanish in Middle School. They often continue one or both in the Upper School and have the option of following a double language track. Offerings in other foreign languages including Chinese, Arabic, Russian, and Greek begin in the ninth grade and are usually coordinated with Gilman and Roland Park. Graduation Requirements: Arts and fine arts (art, music, dance, drama), intro to computer science, English, foreign language, history, mathematics, physical education (includes health), public speaking, science, 50 hours of community service, and a convocation speech.Peterson's, \\"School Overview\\" Athletics On November 25, 1901, Bryn Mawr and St. Timothy's School began what is believed to be the longest continuous girls' high school basketball rivalry in the country, with a silver cup dedicated to the game passed between the schools. The game was quite different from basketball today, played nine on nine on a court divided into three sections, with groups of three in each section. The uniforms were high- collared white blouses over heavy corduroy skirts that came almost to the ground, black stockings and white athletic shoes. The game was played outdoors without a backboard, on a dirt field which would be covered with straw to absorb dampness if necessary. The headmistresses of both schools agreed to a list of rules and conditions, which included prohibiting male spectators (with the exception of William Marston, the Headmaster of Marston School who officiated the game) and guaranteed that none of the girls' names would be published in the newspapers, considered unseemly at the start of the 20th century. The game was finally moved inside in 1928 as interest in field hockey as an outdoor fall sport grew. In December 2011, the two schools played a game in the old-fashioned cloths and rules to remember the first game played between the two schools.Katherine Dunn, \\"St. Tim's-Bryn Mawr: no equal in tradition\\" in The Sun, Baltimore, MD, November 30, 2001; p. 1D.Nelson Coffin, \\"Feelings never old as rivalry renewed\\" in Baltimore Messenger, Baltimore, MD, November 29, 2001; p. 9.Kathy Frazer, \\"Oldie but goodie: This rivalry is antique\\" in The News American, Baltimore, MD, February 1, 1985; p. 5D. In 1926 Rosabelle Sinclair established the first American women's lacrosse team at The Bryn Mawr School, bringing the Native American game to the United States from St Leonards School in Scotland (where it had arrived from Canada).St. Leonard's Lacrosse History In 1992 she was the first woman inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame.Rosabelle Sinclair: National Lacrosse Hall of Fame The first game was held against Friends School of Baltimore. Since 1999, Bryn Mawr has shared Norris Field with the Mount Washington Lacrosse Club, one of the most successful amateur lacrosse teams in history.Jamie Stiehm, Traditions survive in sale of men's club; Bryn Mawr to share lacrosse fields, facilities, The Baltimore Sun, May 31, 1999, retrieved May 28, 2010. The athletics program today provides a wide range of offerings for competitive play including cross country, track, volleyball, basketball, softball, crew, squash, ice hockey, swimming, and dance. There are 17 sports in the Upper School available on the varsity and junior varsity levels, and 13 sports at the Middle School level. Cross Country, Indoor Track, and Outdoor Track showed great improvement during the 2008‚Äì2009 year. For the first time in years, track (both indoor and outdoor) managed to place very well on average in meets. This was done under the instruction of Coach Paul Vece and other assistant coaches. In 2010, the Bryn Mawr Ice Hockey team won their first championship, finally defeating Holton Arms. The varsity soccer team, led by Coach Tina Steck, won three back-to-back IAAM championships in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Like many of the other private schools in Baltimore, Bryn Mawr has a brother and sister school. Bryn Mawr's brother school is Gilman. These two schools are located across the street from each other. Bryn Mawr's sister school (as well as rival school) is the Roland Park Country School (RPCS). The three schools coordinate Upper School classes so that students may attend a wider variety of classes and so that they may interact with their peers at other schools. Roland Park is an all-girls school that is considered a rival to Bryn Mawr, especially when it comes to athletics. Twice an academic year, once in the fall and once in the spring, RPCS and Bryn Mawr hold Spirit Weeks, during which the two schools play games against each other in sports such as field hockey and lacrosse. During the school days of these weeks, students wear costumes in addition to the uniform skirt. Each day of the week has a theme. For instance, if the theme is tropical, then students wear leis, Hawaiian shirts and such. On the final day of Spirit Week, the theme is always school spirit. The RPCS 'Reds' wear red and the Bryn 'Mawrtians' wear green and yellow. Traditions * Founders‚Äô Day: On a day in late September/early October, the entire school gathers in the morning in the Graduation Garden to celebrate the founding of the School in 1885. Faculty and staff awards are presented for recognition of outstanding service to the community. * Bazaar: The Bazaar, begun in 1948 by the Parent's Association, is held on the first Saturday of May and includes activities for all the members of the school community including games, rides, and markets. * Gym Drill: After the Bazaar, the Bryn Mawr community gathers at the upper athletic field for Gym Drill. The Middle and Upper School perform an all-school dance and school exercises which have been performed since 1904, followed by each class in the Middle and Upper Schools performing an ethnic dance. In addition, the seniors perform a dance that they have choreographed. Reunion alumnae classes join in the Banner March in which the Gym Drill captain in each class passes down her banner to mark the completion of the year. The Fifth Grade marches onto the field at the end to receive their first banner, marking the end of their Lower School days. * Bell Ringing: The day before senior projects, each senior rings the bell in the 1992 Belltower with another Bryn Mawr student of her choice (or multiple students). * Class Day: The day before senior graduation, Grades 7‚Äì12 gather for a ceremony to mark the end of the school year. * Graduation: in early June.Upper School Student Handbook, 2007.

The picture was filmed from April 16 to June 19, 1956 and released on December 6, 1956 by Paramount Pictures, almost five months after the Martin and Lewis partnership split up. Plot Malcolm Smith (Jerry Lewis) wins a brand new automobile (a 1956 Chrysler New Yorker convertible) at a movie theatre raffle. Steve Wiley (Dean Martin), a gambler from New York, obtains a counterfeit of the winning ticket and also claims that the car is his. The theatre manager declares them both winners and that they can split the car any way that they want. Steve needs to sell the car to pay off a gambling debt, but Malcolm wants to drive it to Hollywood to meet actress Anita Ekberg. Steve claims to know Ekberg, and agrees to drive to Hollywood with Malcolm, secretly planning to steal the car. Malcolm brings along his dog, a huge Great Dane named Mr. Bascomb who foils Steve in his many attempts to make off with the car. Along the way they pick up Terry (Pat Crowley), an aspiring dancer, who has a job waiting for her in Las Vegas. Once there, Malcolm gets his \\"lucky feeling\\" and wins $10,000 ($ today) at a casino.

It is tall, with 79 floors above ground, and became the tallest residential building in the world on its completion in 2011, surpassing Q1 in Gold Coast, Australia. It lost the record in 2012 to Dubai's Elite Residence. The building was damaged by fire on 21 February 2015, on 4 August 2017, while it was undergoing restorative work, and again on 5 January 2019. History The original concept design by architects Khatib and Alami was 74 floors, with three basement levels and a four-storey podium, and had a total planned built up area of 111,832 m¬≤ (1.2 million ft¬≤). It was to have 504 apartments ranging from one to three bedrooms and four duplex apartment suites. The three basement floors and part of the podium were to hold car parking for 536 vehicles, while floors five and six were to contain a swimming pool, health club, gymnasium, cafeteria, aerobic rooms and sit-out cover seal terraces. However, the original developer of the project for the proposed tower, Al Rashideen Trading Company, transferred ownership of the project to a new developer, Select Group. Select Group then appointed a new consultant, National Engineering Bureau, who amended and modified the concept design and, following delays, eventually secured the necessary approval from Dubai Municipality. Dubai Municipality's approval of the design was delayed because of its comments on the National Engineering Bureau's modifications to the concept design, and the purported risk of structural failings arising from the design modifications. In April 2007, the project was running 18 months behind schedule, with the tower's foundations still under construction. The original expected completion date of June 2008 had been extended to late 2009, with the further extension into 2011. The Marina Torch was opened in May 2011. As built, it has 676 apartments and six retail units. In 2015 the price of a one bedroom apartment started at 1,628,000 AED ($443,295 USD). There are many residential towers in this part of Dubai and they are popular with expatriates. In 2020, an Emirates air hostess committed suicide by jumping off the building. She landed on another balcony 24 floors below. The woman was around 34 years old. https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/reports/a30850466/british-woman-death-dubai/ =2015 fire= A fire broke out in the building at 2:00 am on 21 February 2015. Witnesses said the fire started with a grill located on one of the building's balconies. Seven people were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation. Video footage showed structural debris falling from the burning stories to the ground. The fire appeared to have started in the middle of the building and spread rapidly due to falling flaming debris and high winds, which caused the flames to flare up, resulting in \\"massive problems\\" for the fire department and a several mile long traffic jam on a nearby highway. External cladding was charred from the 50th floor to the top of the tower. As of 28 February 101 apartments were uninhabitable and their occupants were offered temporary free lodging by some hotels and houses. Dubai Municipality confirmed there was no damage to the structure. Lifts were brought back in phases and eight of the nine lifts were back in operation within a week. By 21 March 2015, 81 units were still not habitable. The remainder of the 676 apartments were back in occupation. Tenants requesting emergency accommodation were found free hotel accommodation for up to two months. All resident owners are covered by insurance for alternative accommodation for up to three years. In April, after insurance assessment, tenders were drawn up for repair of the damaged building. Repairs were started in May 2015 under the project management of the building's architect, National Engineering Bureau. Following this disaster, in the fall of 2015 Dubai Civil Defence announced it would be purchasing several Martin Jetpack single-person aircraft to assist first responders in managing high-rise fires, to be delivered in 2016. = 2016 exterior renovation = Approval to proceed on a full exterior renovation of the cladding damaged during the fire in terms of building permits was granted by Dubai authorities in July 2016. Scaffolding was erected and building works started. During this period the pool facility at the Torch remained closed, mainly due to the risk of safety issues. It was estimated to re-open in October 2016. = 2017 fire = A significant fire broke out in the building on 4 August 2017 at about 1 am local time; the cause was not initially known. Videos showed debris from the fire falling to the ground and starting a second fire in the streets below. Civil defence officials said they had successfully evacuated the building, with no injuries reported, and had brought the fire under control. = 2019 fire = A minor broke out in the building on 5 January 2019 during the evening; the source of the fire was thought to be on the fifth floor from the building's gym. Residents were allowed to return to the builing in the early hours of Sunday morning.

History =Foundation to Reformation= The monastery was founded in 1084-85 in the Black Forest, by the source of the Brigach, against the background of the Investiture Controversy, as a result of the community of interests of the Swabian aristocracy and the church reform party, the founders being Hezelo and Hesso of the family of the V√∂gte of Reichenau, and the politically influential Abbot William of Hirsau. The intended site was initially to be at K√∂nigseggwald in Upper Swabia, but at William's behest St. Georgen was chosen instead. The settlement, by monks from Hirsau Abbey, took place in the spring and summer of 1084; the chapel was dedicated on 24 June 1085. At first a priory of Hirsau, the new foundation was declared an independent abbey in 1086, and under Abbot Theoger (1088-1119) began to accumulate the extensive estates, possessions and legal rights which made it one of the greatest religious houses of south- western Germany. The first V√∂gte (\\"lords protector\\") were the founder Hezelo (d. 1088) and his son Hermann (d. 1094). The abbey then came into conflict with the next Vogt, Ulrich of Hirrlingen, and was obliged to appeal to King Henry V. From 1114 the V√∂gte were the Z√§hringen Dukes; on their extinction in 1218, the office was taken over by the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick II (1212/1215-c. 1250). To attempt to curb the excessive control of the V√∂gte over the abbey, the abbots obtained privileges (8 March 1095 and 2 November 1105) from the papacy granting them guarantees of libertas Romana (\\"Roman freedom\\"), which included papal protection for the abbey and the right to elect their own abbots freely. Successive abbots throughout the later Middle Ages had these important rights repeatedly confirmed. A particularly important papal privilege was that of Pope Alexander III, dated 26 March 1179, which makes clear the significance of St. George's as a centre of Benedictine reform in Alsace, Lotharingia, Swabia and Bavaria in the 12th century by naming numerous religious communities in close contact with St. George's, either as its foundations or because it exercised pastoral authority over them or had been involved in their reform. The nunneries at Amtenhausen (1102) and Friedenweiler (1123) were founded from St. George's and were its priories, as was the monastery at Lixheim in Alsace (1107), the nunnery at Urspring (1127) and the \\"Cell of St. Nicholas\\" at Rippoldsau (before 1179). Monks from St. George's were the spiritual directors of the nunneries at Krauftal (1124/30) and Varg√©ville (about 1126), while Ottobeuren Abbey (1102), Admont Abbey (1115), Saints Ulrich and Afra's Abbey in Augsburg (before 1120) and Pr√ºfening Abbey (1121) had had abbots or other reforming influences from St. George's. St. George's itself was of course, as a foundation of Hirsau, part of the Hirsau Reform, in its turn inspired by and parallel to the Cluniac Reform. This powerful reforming impetus of the first third of the 12th century, under Abbots Theoger and Werner I (d. 1134), seems however to have stagnated later in the century. The abbey thereafter began a slow but marked decline, emphasized by a disastrous fire in 1244. In common with many other religious houses of the period, it also experienced a loss of spiritual zeal and discipline, and well as financial losses, dwindling income and mismanagement. The low point was probably the supposed murder of Abbot Heinrich III (1335-1347) by his successor, Abbot Ulrich II (1347, 1359, and 1364-1368). Some improvement took place around the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries with the appointment of the reforming Abbot Johann III Kern (1392-1427). The increasingly aggressive claims of the \\"V√∂gte\\", who between about 1250 and the early 15th century were the Counts of Falkenstein, and after them the Dukes of W√ºrttemberg, were difficult for the abbots to counter, given their lack of \\"reichsunmittelbar\\" status, and despite the possession of its hard-won papal privileges the abbey steadily diminished in influence, until in 1536 the Dukes of W√ºrttemberg, against the background of the Reformation, dissolved the abbey and expelled the monks. =Post-Reformation= The monks did not disperse at the suppression of St. George's, in which a Protestant religious community was established in 1566, but moved to the vacant monastery at Villingen, in Habsburg territory in nearby Austria. During the Thirty Years' War an attempt was made between 1629 and 1632 to re-settle St. George's, but it came to nothing, and the premises and the church were destroyed by fire on 13 October 1633. It was not re-built. The town of St. Georgen im Schwarzwald suffered a serious fire in 1865, and the ruins of the abbey were used as a quarry for its re-building.

The French ships were in bad order; their crews were excessively weak; and thus they could not escape the vastly superior British force. The Blanche was overtaken and captured on the evening of the 21st; the Fortunes, by throwing her quarter-deck guns overboard, kept away a little longer, but was captured at last in the early morning of 22 December, an hour before the Elise.

They obeyed Cochrane's command to ground their arms but refused his order to step forward. The mutineers picked up their arms and fired a volley. Shots were returned, followed by a bayonet charge that broke their ranks and a close range fire fight ensued.

He sat in the Legislative Council from 1883 to 1884, 1885 to 1886, 1894 to 1898, 1902 to 1906, and finally from 1910 to 1934. Wittenoom was a minister in the government of Sir John Forrest, and was also Agent-General for Western Australia between 1898 and 1901.  Biography  = Early life = Born in Fremantle, Western Australia on 12 February 1854, Wittenoom was the son of bank director and pastoralist Charles Wittenoom. He was educated at Bishop Hale's School (now Hale School) in Perth, then at 15 worked at Bowes sheep station at Northampton from the age of 15. In 1874, he took up sheep farming with his brother Frank at Yuin in the Murchison district, before returning to Bowes in 1877 to lease and manage it. On 23 April 1878 he married Laura Habgood; they would have two sons and three daughters. In 1881, Wittenoom purchased the Geraldton station White Peak from John Drummond, and established a sheep stud farm there. From 1883 to 1886 he also owned a station at La Grange. He ran a stock and station agency in Geraldton in 1886 and 1887, but later sold it. He became heavily involved in business and finance, becoming managing director for Dalgety & Co. in 1901; chairman of directors of Millars Karri and Jarrah Co.; chairman of Bovril Australian Estates; director of the Bank of New South Wales; director of Commercial Union Insurance; and director of the WA Bank. He was president of the Pastoralists' Association from 1912 to 1915, and again in 1917. = Political career = From around 1883, Wittenoom became increasingly involved in public life. On 30 May of that year he was elected to the Legislative Council's Geraldton seat in a by-election occasioned by the resignation of Maitland Brown. Wittenoom resigned the seat on 23 January 1884 and was replaced by John Sydney Davis. He again won the seat in a by-election on 25 June 1885 but resigned again on 6 November 1886. He became a member of the Murchison Road Board in 1890. On 16 July 1894 Wittenoom was elected to the Legislative Council for the Central Province. On 19 December of that year he was appointed Minister for Mines, Education, and Posts and Telegraphs in the Forrest ministry. At that time, newly appointed ministers were required to re- contest their seats, so Wittenoom resigned his seat on 19 December, and was re-elected in the subsequent ministerial by-election of 16 January 1895. He retained his seat and ministerial portfolio until the general election of 28 April 1898, which he did not contest. The following month he was appointed Agent General for Western Australia in London, a position that he held until 1901. While in the UK, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1900, being the last KCMG to be personally invested by Queen Victoria at Osborne House prior to her death in January 1901. Edward Wittenoom c. 1922 On returning to Western Australia, Wittenoom was again elected to the Legislative Council on 12 May 1902, this time for the North Province. He held his seat until 6 November 1906, when he resigned to contest a seat in the Australian Senate in the federal election of 12 December. He stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Western Australian Party. He returned to state politics in the following election, winning a North Province seat in the Legislative Council on 13 May 1910. He would hold this seat for 24 years, finally losing after declining to contest the election of 12 May 1934. During this period, he was President of the Legislative Council from 27 July 1922 to 10 August 1926. He also spent a brief period at consul for France in Western Australia. = Final years = Wittenoom's first wife died in 1923, and on 22 December 1924 he married Isobel du Boulay, with whom he would have two daughters. Wittenoom died at West Perth on 5 March 1936, and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery. One of Wittenoom's sons, Charles Horne Wittenoom, also became a member of the Legislative Council.

These animals are known from several localities in Europe and North America, as well as a single record from Argentina. Trigonotarbids can be envisaged as spider-like arachnids, but without silk-producing spinnerets. They ranged in size from a few millimetres to a few centimetres in body length and had segmented abdomens, with the tergites across the backs of the animals' abdomens, which were characteristically divided into three or five separate plates. Probably living as predators on other arthropods, some later trigonotarbid species were quite heavily armoured and protected themselves with spines and tubercles. About seventy species are currently known, with most fossils originating from the Carboniferous coal measures. In July 2014 scientists used computer graphics to re-create a possible walking gait for the animal. However, a subsequent biomechanical analysis proved the proposed coordination pattern as largely non-physiological. Historical background Kreischeria fossil in Vienna The first trigonotarbid was described in 1837 from the coal measures of Coalbrookdale in England by the famous English geologist Dean William Buckland. He believed it to be a fossil beetle and named it Curculoides prestvicii. A much better preserved example was later discovered from Coseley near Dudley; also in the English West Midlands conurbation. Described in 1871 by Henry Woodward, he correctly identified it as an arachnid and renamed it Eophrynus prestvicii‚Äîwhereby the genus name comes from (', meaning 'dawn'), and Phrynus, a genus of living whip spider (Amblypygi). Woodward subsequently described another trigonotarbid, Brachypyge carbonis, from the coal measures of Mons in Belgium; although this fossil is known only from its abdomen and was initially mistaken for the back end of a crab. =A new arachnid order= In 1882, the German zoologist Ferdinand Karsch described a number of fossil arachnids from the coal measures of Neurode in Silesia (now Poland), including one he named Anthracomartus voelkelianus in honour of Herr V√∂lkel, the foreman of the mine where it was discovered. This species was raised to a new, extinct, arachnid order which Karsch called Anthracomarti. The name is derived from ('), the Greek word for coal. A number of other fossils which would eventually be placed in Trigonotarbida were discovered around this time. Hanns Bruno Geinitz described Kreischeria wiedei from the coal measures of Zwickau in Germany, although he interpreted it as a fossil pseudoscorpion. Johann Ku≈°ta described Anthracomartus krejcii from Rakovn√≠k in the Czech Republic, and published further descriptions in a number of subsequent papers. In 1884, Samuel Hubbard Scudder described Anthracomartus trilobitus from Fayetteville, Arkansas‚Äîthe first trigonotarbid from North America. Relationships Early studies tended to confuse trigonotarbids with other living or extinct groups of arachnids; particularly harvestmen (Opiliones). Petrunkevitch's division of the trigonotarbids into two, unrelated, orders was noted above. In detail, he divided the arachnids into suborders based on the width of the division between the two parts of the body (the prosoma and opisthosoma). Anthracomartida and another extinct order, Haptopoda, were grouped into a subclass Stethostomata defined by a broad division of the body and downward- hanging mouthparts. Trigonotarbida was placed in its own subclass Soluta and defined as having a division of the body which was variable in width. Petrunkevitch's scheme was largely followed in subsequent studies of fossil arachnids. =Pantetrapulmonata= In the 1980s, Bill Shear and colleagues carried out an important study on well preserved Mid Devonian trigonotarbids from Gilboa, New York. They questioned whether it was appropriate to define a group of animals on a variable character state and carried out the first cladistic analysis of fossil and living arachnids. They showed that trigonotarbids are closely related to a group of arachnids which have gone under various names (Caulogastra, Arachnidea, etc.), but for which the name Tetrapulmonata has become most widespread. Members of the Tetrapulmonata include spiders, whip spiders, whip scorpions and Schizomida and, together with trigonotarbids, share characters like two pairs of book lungs and similar mouthparts with fangs operating rather like a pocket knife. In a 2007 study of arachnid relationships, the Shear et al. hypothesis was largely supported and a group Pantetrapulmonata was proposed which comprises Trigonotarbida + Tetrapulmonata. This has since been corroborated in more recent cladistic analyses. =Trigonotarbids and ricinuleids= In 1892, Ferdinand Karsch suggested that the rare and rather bizarre-looking ricinuleids (Ricinulei) were the last living descendants of the trigonotarbids. A similar hypothesis was reintroduced by Dunlop, who pointed out distinct similarities between these arachnid groups. Both have opisthosomal tergites divided into median and lateral plates and both have a complicated coupling mechanism between the prosoma and the opisthosoma which 'locks' the two halves of the body together. Although cladistic analysis has tended to recover ricinuleids in their traditional position closely related to mites and ticks, further discoveries have revealed that the tip of the pedipalp ends in a small claw in both trigonotarbids and ricinuleids. =Internal relationships= The first cladistic analysis of the trigonotarbids was published in 2014. This recovered the families Anthracomartidae, Anthracosironidae, and Eophrynidae as monophyletic. In contrast Trigonotarbidae, Aphantomartidae, Palaeocharinidae, and Kreischeriidae were not. Two clades were consistently recovered with strong support‚Äî(Palaeocharinus (Archaeomartidae + Anthracomartidae)), and Lissomartus as sister group the 'eophrynid assemblage' (Aphantomartus (Alkenia (Pseudokreischeria (Kreischeria (Eophrynus + Pleophrynus))))). Description Trigonotarbids superficially resemble spiders, but can be easily recognised by having tergites on the dorsal side of the abdomen divided into median and lateral plates. This character is shared with ricinuleids (Ricinulei) (see also Ricinulei#Relationships). As in other arachnids, the body is divided into a prosoma (or cephalothorax) and opisthosoma (or abdomen). Body length ranges from a couple of millimetres up to about . =Prosoma= The prosoma is covered by the carapace and always bears a pair of median eyes. In the probably basal families Palaeocharinidae, Anthracomartidae‚Äîand perhaps also Anthracosironidae‚Äîthere is an additional pair of lateral eye tubercles which, at least in palaeocharinids, appear to have borne a series of individual lenses. In this sense palaeocharinids seem to be in the process of reducing a compound eye. The chelicerae are of the \\"pocket-knife\\" type consisting of a basal segment and a sharp, curving fang. The chelicerae are described as paleognathic: the fangs are held parallel to one another, like those of mesothele and mygalomorph spiders, but the chelicerae hang downwards like those of araneomorph spiders. There is no evidence in well-preserved fossils for the opening of a venom gland, thus trigonotarbids were probably not venomous. The chelicerae may have been slightly retractable into the prosoma. Well-preserved palaeocharinids show evidence for a small, slit-like mouth with an upper lip (a labrum or rostrum) and a lower lip (or labium). Inside the mouth there is some sort of filtering system formed from hairs or platelets which strongly suggests that trigonotarbids (like spiders and many other arachnids) could eat only preorally digested, liquified prey. The pedipalps have the typical arachnid structure with a coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia and tarsus. They are pediform, i.e. they look like small legs and were not modified into pincers. There is no evidence for a special sperm transfer device as in the modified palpal organ of male spiders. In at least the palaeocharinids and anthracomartids the tip of the pedipalp is modified into a small claw formed from the tarsal claw (or apotele) and a projection from the tarsus. As mentioned above, a very similar arrangement is seen at the end of the pedipalp in Ricinulei. The walking legs again follow the typical arachnid plan with a coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus and tarsus. The coxae surround a single sternum. In well preserved palaeocharinids there is a ring, or annulus, around the trochanter‚Äìfemur joint which may be the remains of an earlier leg segment. The legs are largely unmodified, although in Anthracosironidae the forelegs are quite large and spiny, presumably to help catch prey. The legs end in three claws, two large ones and a smaller median claw.

The requirement for new ministers to stand for re-election was introduced in the House of Commons of Great Britain in 1707 and also featured in Westminster system parliaments modelled on it. In latter times, the by- election was usually a formality, uncontested by the opposition. In the United Kingdom, ministerial by-elections were abolished as an anachronism in 1926. The Irish Free State,Constitution of the Irish Free State, Article 58 \\"The appointment of a member of D√°il Eireann to be a Minister shall not entail upon him any obligation to resign his seat or to submit himself for re-election.\\" Union of South Africa, and Dominion of New Zealand never had them. Westminster Ministerial by-elections were a feature of the House of Commons of Great Britain, and its successor the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, from 1707 to 1926. Seventeenth-century English history established the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, in particular from interference by the monarch. In 1624, the House of Commons of England resolved that an MP could not resign his seat, and in 1680 it resolved that accepting an office of profit from the Crown would precipitate resignation from the House. Sections 24 and 25 of the Succession to the Crown Act 1707 listed ministerial offices among those considered offices of profit, while mitigating this by allowing the option of standing for re-election.Isaacs 2005, p.34; A minister typically sought re-election in the same constituency he had just vacated, but occasionally contested another seat which was also vacant. The Reform Act 1867 made cabinet reshuffles easier by abolishing the necessity to seek re-election for an existing minister taking a new portfolio.Pugh 2008 In 1910 The Times newspaper noted that the relevant Act had been passed in the reign of Queen Anne \\"to prevent the Court from swamping the House of Commons with placemen and pensioners\\", and described the process as \\"anomalous\\" and \\"indefensible\\" in the 20th century. During the First World War, temporary acts in 1915 and 1916 suspended the requirement for re-election, in order to allow the War Cabinets of the Asquith coalition ministry and the Lloyd George ministry to be appointed quickly. The Re-Election of Ministers Act 1919 ended the requirement within nine months of a general election, and the Re-Election of Ministers Act (1919) Amendment Act 1926, introduced by the opposition as a private member's bill, ended the practice in all other cases.Isaacs 2005, p.36 Canada Ministerial by-elections also occurred in the federal House of Commons of Canada until 1931, and in Canadian provincial assemblies. One controversy within the 1926 King‚ÄìByng Affair was prime minister Arthur Meighen's appointment of \\"acting ministers\\" to circumvent the need for by- elections.Isaacs 2005, pp.39‚Äì40 Ministerial by-elections were abolished by the Legislative Assemblies of Alberta in 1926, of Quebec, of New Brunswick, and of Nova Scotia in 1927, of British Columbia in 1929, of Prince Edward Island in 1932, of Saskatchewan in 1936, of Manitoba in 1937, and of Ontario in 1941 (partially in 1926).Isaacs 2005, p.40 In addition Newfoundland, at the time a separate Dominion from Canada, abolished Ministerial by-elections in 1928.

Although given a variable star designation, it is now thought to be constant; the identifier HD 94776 from the Henry Draper catalogue may be used instead. It has an orange hue and is dimly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 5.93. The distance to this object is approximately 285 light years based on parallax, and it has an absolute magnitude of 1.08. It is drifting closer to the Sun with a radial velocity of ‚àí26 km/s. This is an aging giant star with a stellar classification of K0III, which indicates it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and expanded off the main sequence. It is a red clump giant, which means it is on the horizontal branch and is undergoing core helium fusion. At present it has nine times the Sun's radius and is radiating 39 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,729 K. When used as a comparison star for AG Carinae in 1914 by H. E. Wood, this object was announced as a candidate variable star. A year later it was determined by R. Innis that it was AG Carinae that varied and this star is constant. Later, T Carinae became flagged as a low amplitude irregular variable. It is now catalogued as a probable constant star.

The band's lineup consists of founding members Jeff Ament (bass guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar), Mike McCready (lead guitar), and Eddie Vedder (lead vocals, guitar), as well as Matt Cameron (drums), who joined in 1998. Keyboardist Boom Gaspar has also been a touring/session member with the band since 2002. Drummers Jack Irons, Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, and Dave Abbruzzese are former members of the band. Pearl Jam outsold many of its contemporary alternative rock bands from the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade, being dubbed as the \\"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s\\". Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten, in 1991. Ten stayed on the Billboard 200 chart for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest- selling rock records ever, going 13x platinum in the United States. Released in 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold over 950,000 copies in its first week of release, setting the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release at the time. Their third album, Vitalogy (1994), became the second-fastest-selling CD in history at the time, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week. One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or giving interviews. The band also sued Ticketmaster, claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \\"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\\" Pearl Jam had sold more than 85million albums worldwide by 2018, including nearly 32million albums in the United States by 2012, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 in its first year of eligibility. They were ranked at No. 8 in a reader poll by Rolling Stone magazine in its \\"Top Ten Live Acts of All Time\\" issue. Throughout its career, they have also promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-choice sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues. History =Formation and early years (1984‚Äì1990)= Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament were members of grunge band Green River during the mid-1980s. Green River toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and bandmates Mark Arm and Steve Turner.Azerrad, Michael. Our Band Could Be Your Life. Little Brown and Company, 2001. , p. 422. In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with Malfunkshun vocalist Andrew Wood, eventually organizing the band Mother Love Bone. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing interest and found the support of the PolyGram record label, which signed the band in early 1989. Mother Love Bone's debut album, Apple, was released in July 1990, four months after Wood died of a heroin overdose. Ament and Gossard were devastated by the death of Wood and the resulting demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position. Irons passed on the invitation but gave the demo to his basketball friend, San Diego, California singer Eddie Vedder.Wall, Mick. \\"Alive\\". Nirvana and the Story of Grunge. Q p. 95 Vedder was the lead vocalist for a San Diego band, Bad Radio, and worked part-time at a gas station. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him. He then recorded the vocals to three of the songs (\\"Alive\\", \\"Once\\", and \\"Footsteps\\") in what he later described as a \\"mini-opera\\" entitled Momma-Son. Vedder sent the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were impressed enough to fly Vedder up to Seattle for an audition. Within a week, Vedder had joined the band. With the addition of Dave Krusen on drums, the band took the name Mookie Blaylock, in reference to the then-active basketball player. The band played its first official show at the Off Ramp Caf√© in Seattle on October 22, 1990. They opened for Alice in Chains at the Moore Theatre in Seattle on December 22, 1990, and served as the opening act for the band's Facelift tour in 1991. Mookie Blaylock soon signed to Epic Records and renamed themselves Pearl Jam. In an early promotional interview, Vedder said that the name \\"Pearl Jam\\" was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special recipe for peyote-laced jam.Neely, Kim. \\"Right Here, Right Now\\". Rolling Stone. October 31, 1991. In a 2006 Rolling Stone cover story however, Vedder admitted that this story was \\"total bullshit\\", even though he indeed had a great-grandma named Pearl. Ament and McCready explained that Ament came up with \\"pearl\\", and that the band later settled on \\"Pearl Jam\\" after attending a concert by Neil Young, in which he extended his songs as improvisations of 15‚Äì20 minutes in length. =Ten and the grunge explosion (1991‚Äì1992)= Pearl Jam entered Seattle's London Bridge Studios in March 1991 to record its debut album, Ten.Pearlman, Nina. \\"Black Days\\".

Krusen left the band in May 1991 after checking himself into rehabilitation;Greene, Jo-Ann. \\"Pearl Jam and the Secret History of Seattle Part 2.\\" Goldmine. August 1993. he was replaced by Matt Chamberlain, who had previously played with Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. After playing only a handful of shows, one of which was filmed for the \\"Alive\\" video, Chamberlain left to join the Saturday Night Live band. Chamberlain suggested Dave Abbruzzese as his replacement. Abbruzzese joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam's live shows supporting Ten. Released on August 27, 1991, Ten (named after Mookie Blaylock's jersey number) contained eleven tracks dealing with dark subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. Ten's musical style, influenced by classic rock, combined an \\"expansive harmonic vocabulary\\" with an anthemic sound. The album was slow to sell, but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the Billboard charts. Ten produced the hit singles \\"Alive\\", \\"Even Flow\\", and \\"Jeremy\\". Originally interpreted as an anthem by many, Vedder later revealed that \\"Alive\\" tells the semi- autobiographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather, while his mother's grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father. In this lyric, even though Vedder originally looked at \\"being alive as a curse,\\" as the sadness the speaker in the song suggests, \\"...But as fans quickly turned the title phrase into a self-empowering anthem, particularly at Pearl Jam concerts, Vedder said, \\"they lifted the curse. The audience changed the meaning for me,\\" he told VH1 Storytellers in 2006. The song \\"Jeremy\\" and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates. Ten stayed on the Billboard charts for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13x platinum. With the success of Ten, Pearl Jam became a key member of the Seattle grunge explosion, along with Alice in Chains, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. The band was criticized in the music press; British music magazine NME said that Pearl Jam was \\"trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets.\\"Gilbert, Jeff. \\"New Power Generation\\". Guitar World: Nirvana and the Seattle Sound. 1993. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band were commercial sellouts,Al & Cake. \\"An interview with...Kurt Cobain\\".

Cobain later reconciled with Vedder, and they reportedly were on amicable terms before Cobain's death in 1994. Pearl Jam toured relentlessly in support of Ten. Ament stated that \\"essentially Ten was just an excuse to tour,\\" adding, \\"We told the record company, 'We know we can be a great band, so let's just get the opportunity to get out and play.'\\"Coryat, Karl. \\"Godfather of the 'G' Word\\". Bass Player magazine. April 1994. The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, \\"Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it.\\" Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that \\"playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates.\\" In 1992, Pearl Jam made television appearances on Saturday Night Live and MTV Unplugged and took a slot on that summer's Lollapalooza tour with Ministry, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Soundgarden, among others. The band contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the 1992 Cameron Crowe film Singles: \\"State of Love and Trust\\" and \\"Breath\\". Ament, Gossard and Vedder appeared in Singles under the name \\"Citizen Dick\\"; their parts were filmed when Pearl Jam was known as Mookie Blaylock. =Vs., Vitalogy and dealing with success (1993‚Äì1995)= The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder. While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for \\"Jeremy\\", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for \\"Black\\" in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own interpretations of the song, stating that \\"Before music videos first came out, you'd listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you'd come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression.\\"Neely, Kim. Five Against One: The Pearl Jam Story. \\"The Lost 'Jeremy' Video. pp. 109‚Äì113. New York, NY. Penguin Books. \\"Ten years from now,\\" Ament said, \\"I don't want people to remember our songs as videos.\\" Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, \\"The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy.\\"\\"Interview with Stone Gossard and Mike McCready\\". Total Guitar. November 2002. Released on October 19, 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold 950,378 copies in its first week of release and outperformed all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined. The album set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release, which it held until broken by Garth Brooks' 1998 album, Double Live. Vs. included the singles \\"Go\\", \\"Daughter\\", \\"Animal\\", and \\"Dissident\\". Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said, \\"Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than this one did with Ten; and Vs. tops even that debut.\\" He added, \\"Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend, Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations... As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites us into a drama of experiment and strife.\\" The band decided, beginning with the release of Vs., to scale back its commercial efforts.Ashare, Matt. \\"The Sweet Smell of (Moderate) Success\\". CMJ. July 2000. The members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of \\"Jeremy\\" and opted for fewer interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour that year to the touring habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band \\"ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans.\\"DeRogatis, Jim. Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. , p. 58. During the Vs. Tour, the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers.DeRogatis, p. 59. By 1994, Pearl Jam was \\"fighting on all fronts\\", as its manager described the band at the time.DeRogatis, p. 60. Reporter Chuck Philips broke a series of stories showing that Ticketmaster was gouging Pearl Jam's customers. Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of charity benefit shows in Chicago, Illinois, it discovered that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Pearl Jam was committed to keeping their concert ticket prices down but Fred Rosen of Ticketmaster refused to waive the service charge. Since Ticketmaster controlled most major venues, the band was forced to create from scratch its own outdoor stadiums in rural areas in order to perform. Pearl Jam's efforts to organize a tour without the ticket giant collapsed, which Pearl Jam said was evidence of Ticketmaster's monopoly. An analysis of journalist Chuck Philips investigative series in a well known legal monograph concluded that it was hard to imagine a legitimate reason for Ticketmaster's exclusive contracts with venues and contracts which covered such a lengthy period of time. The authors said, \\"The pervasiveness of Ticketmaster's exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act.\\" The United States Department of Justice was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Band members Gossard and Ament testified at a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994 in Washington, D.C.Wall, Mick. \\"Alive\\". Nirvana and the Story of Grunge. Q p. 99 Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to gouge fans. After Pearl Jam's testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees. Pearl Jam's manager said he was gratified that Congress recognized the problem as a national issue. The band eventually canceled its 1994 summer tour in protest. After the Justice Department dropped the case, Pearl Jam continued to boycott Ticketmaster, refusing to play venues that had contracts with the company.DeRogatis, p. 64‚Äì65. The band tried to work around Ticketmaster's exclusive contracts by hosting charities and benefits at major venues, because the exclusive contracts often contained a clause allowing charity event promoters to sell their own tickets. Music critic Jim DeRogatis noted that along with the Ticketmaster debacle, \\"the band has refused to release singles or make videos; it has demanded that its albums be released on vinyl; and it wants to be more like its '60s heroes, The Who, releasing two or three albums a year.\\" He also stated that sources said that most of the band's third album Vitalogy was completed by early 1994, but that either a forced delay by Epic or the battle with Ticketmaster were to blame for the delay. Pearl Jam wrote and recorded while touring behind Vs. and the majority of the tracks for Vitalogy were recorded during breaks on the tour. Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by this time. Producer Brendan O'Brien said, \\"Vitalogy was a little strained. I'm being polite‚Äîthere was some imploding going on.\\" After Pearl Jam finished the recording of Vitalogy, drummer Dave Abbruzzese was fired. The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, Abbruzzese disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott. He was replaced by Jack Irons, who had connected Vedder to the rest of the band some four years prior. Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young's 1994 Bridge School Benefit, but he was not officially announced as the band's new drummer until its 1995 Self- Pollution satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour-long pirate broadcast out of Seattle which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it.Gaar, Gillian G. \\"Radio Free Vedder\\". Rolling Stone. February 23, 1995. Vitalogy was released first on November 22, 1994 on vinyl and then two weeks later on December 6, 1994 on CD and cassette. The CD became the second- fastest-selling in history, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that \\"thanks to its stripped- down, lean production, Vitalogy stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album.\\" Many of the songs on the album appear to be inspired by the pressures of fame.Weisel, Al. \\"Pearl Jam: Vitalogy\\". Rolling Stone. December 15, 1994. p. 91‚Äì92. The song \\"Spin the Black Circle\\", an homage to vinyl records, won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Hard Rock Performance. Vitalogy also included the songs \\"Not for You\\", \\"Corduroy\\", \\"Better Man\\", and \\"Immortality\\". \\"Better Man\\" (), a song originally written and performed by Vedder while in Bad Radio, reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, spending a total of eight weeks there. Considered a \\"blatantly great pop song\\" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility. The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its 1995 tour for Vitalogy, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined in.DeRogatis, p. 64. Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States for the next three years.DeRogatis, p. 65. Ament later said, \\"We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career.\\" In the same year Pearl Jam backed Neil Young, whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album Mirror Ball. Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes. Two songs from the sessions were left off Mirror Ball: \\"I Got Id\\" and \\"Long Road\\". These two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam in the form of the 1995 EP, Merkin Ball. =No Code and Yield (1996‚Äì1999)= Following the round of touring for Vitalogy, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, No Code. Vedder said, \\"Making No Code was all about gaining perspective.\\"Marks, Craig. \\"The Road Less Traveled\\". Spin. February 1997. Released in 1996, No Code was seen as a deliberate break from the band's sound since Ten, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that \\"No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.\\" The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination,Hilburn, Robert. \\"Working Their Way Out of a Jam\\". Los Angeles Times. December 22, 1996. with Ament stating, \\"In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up.\\" Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles \\"Who You Are\\" (), \\"Hail, Hail\\", and \\"Off He Goes\\". As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was \\"a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time\\" and that \\"it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band.\\" Lead guitarist Mike McCready in Columbia, Maryland on September 18, 1998 Following the short tour for No Code, the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort among all members of the group, with Ament stating that \\"everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band.\\"\\"Pearl Jam Talks About New Approach To Yield\\". MTV.com. February 4, 1998. On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has \\"turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten.\\" Lyrically, Yield continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on No Code,Mulvey, John. \\"Interview with Pearl Jam\\". NME. May 13, 2000. with Vedder saying, \\"What was rage in the past has become reflection.\\"\\"Tentaciones\\". El Pa√≠s. February 13, 1998. Yield debuted at number two on the Billboard charts, but like No Code soon began dropping down the charts. It included the singles \\"Given to Fly\\" and \\"Wishlist\\". The band hired comic book artist Todd McFarlane to create an animated video for the song \\"Do the Evolution\\" from the album, its first music video since 1992. A documentary detailing the making of Yield, Single Video Theory, was released on VHS and DVD later that year. In April 1998, Pearl Jam once again changed drummers. Jack Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring and was replaced with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron on an initially temporary basis, but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. Pearl Jam's 1998 Yield Tour in North America marked the band's return to full-scale touring. The band's anti-trust lawsuit against Ticketmaster had proven to be unsuccessful and hindered live tours. Many fans had complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use of non-Ticketmaster venues, which were judged to be out-of-the-way and impersonal. For this tour and future tours, Pearl Jam once again began using Ticketmaster in order to \\"better accommodate concertgoers.\\" The 1998 summer tour was a big success,Hinckley, David. \\"Vedder's Not Finished\\". New York Daily News. August 10, 1999. and after it was completed the band released Live on Two Legs, a live album which featured select performances from the tour. In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded \\"Last Kiss\\", a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was recorded during a soundcheck and released on the band's 1998 fan club Christmas single. The following year, the cover was put into heavy rotation across the country. By popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999, with all of the proceeds going to the aid of refugees of the Kosovo War. The band also decided to include the song on the 1999 charity compilation album, No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees. \\"Last Kiss\\" peaked at number two on the Billboard charts and became the band's highest-charting single. =Binaural and the Roskilde tragedy (2000‚Äì2001)= Following its full-scale tour in support of Yield, the band took a short break, but then reconvened toward the end of 1999 and commenced work on a new album. On May 16, 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, Binaural. It was drummer Matt Cameron's studio recording debut with the band. The title is a reference to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer Tchad Blake, known for his use of the technique. Binaural was the first album since the band's debut not produced by Brendan O'Brien, although O'Brien was called in later to remix several tracks. Gossard stated that the band members \\"were ready for a change.\\" Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone said, \\"Apparently as tired of grunge as everyone except Creed fans, Pearl Jam delve elsewhere.\\" He added, \\"The album reflects both Pearl Jam's longstanding curse of self-importance and a renewed willingness to be experimental or just plain odd.\\" The album is lyrically darker than the band's previous album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as \\"pretty sombre.\\" Binaural included the singles \\"Nothing as It Seems\\" (), one of the songs featuring binaural recording, and \\"Light Years\\". The album sold just over 700,000 copies and became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach platinum status. Pearl Jam in Columbia, Maryland on September 4, 2000 Pearl Jam decided to record every show on its 2000 Binaural Tour professionally, after noting the desire of fans to own a copy of the shows they attended and the popularity of bootleg recordings. The band had been open in the past about allowing fans to make amateur recordings, and these \\"official bootlegs\\" were an attempt to provide a more affordable and better quality product for fans. Pearl Jam originally intended to release them to only fan club members, but the band's record contract prevented it from doing so. Pearl Jam released all of the albums in record stores as well as through its fan club. The band released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001, and twice set a record for most albums to debut in the Billboard 200 at the same time. Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour ended in tragedy on June 30, with an accident at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death as the crowd rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but it was already too late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event. A month after the European tour concluded, the band embarked on its two-leg 2000 North American tour. On performing after the Roskilde tragedy, Vedder said that \\"playing, facing crowds, being together‚Äîit enabled us to start processing it.\\" On October 22, 2000, the band played the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band. Vedder took the opportunity to thank the many people who had helped the band come together and make it to ten years. He noted that \\"I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something.\\" After concluding the Binaural Tour, the band released Touring Band 2000 the following year. The DVD featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour. Following the events of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Vedder and McCready were joined by Neil Young to perform the song \\"Long Road\\" from the Merkin Ball EP at the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert. The concert, which aired on September 21, 2001, raised money for the victims and their families. =Riot Act (2002‚Äì2005)= Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording environment as \\"a pretty positive one\\" and \\"very intense and spiritual.\\"Stout, Gene. \\"A charged-up Pearl Jam is really into its daring new 'Riot Act'\\". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. November 12, 2002. Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, \\"There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed.\\"Associated Press. \\"New Pearl Jam CD Boosts Grunge Revival\\". The Sydney Morning Herald. November 28, 2002. Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles \\"I Am Mine\\" and \\"Save You\\". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as \\"Love Boat Captain\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said \\"Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy‚Äîa muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours.\\" The track entitled \\"Arc\\" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs. In 2003, the band embarked on its Riot Act Tour, which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: Perth, Tokyo, State College, Pennsylvania, two shows from Madison Square Garden, and Mansfield, Massachusetts. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed Riot Act's \\"Bu$hleaguer\\", a commentary on President George W. Bush, with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had \\"impaled\\" the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's Denver, Colorado show. In June 2003, Pearl Jam announced it was officially leaving Epic Records following the end of its contract with the label. The band stated it had \\"no interest\\" in signing with another label. The band's first release without a label was the single for \\"Man of the Hour\\", in partnership with Amazon.com. Director Tim Burton approached Pearl Jam to request an original song for the soundtrack of his new film, Big Fish. After screening an early print of the film, Pearl Jam recorded the song for him. \\"Man of the Hour\\", which was later nominated for a Golden Globe Award, can be heard in the closing credits of Big Fish. The band released Lost Dogs, a two-disc collection of rarities and B-sides, and Live at the Garden, a DVD featuring the band's July 8, 2003 concert at Madison Square Garden through Epic Records in November 2003. In 2004, Pearl Jam released the live album, Live at Benaroya Hall, through a one-album deal with BMG. 2004 marked the first time that Pearl Jam licensed a song for usage in a television show; a snippet of the song \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" was used in the final episode of the television series Friends. Later that year, Epic released rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991‚Äì2003), a Pearl Jam greatest hits collection spanning 1991 to 2003. This release marked the end of Pearl Jam's contractual agreement with Epic Records. Pearl Jam played a show at Easy Street Records in Seattle in April 2005; recordings from the show were compiled for the Live at Easy Street album and released exclusively to independent record stores in June 2006. The band embarked on a Canadian cross-country tour in September 2005, kicking off the tour with a fundraising concert in Missoula, Montana for Democratic politician Jon Tester, then playing the Gorge Amphitheater before crossing into Canada. After touring Canada, Pearl Jam proceeded to open a Rolling Stones concert in Pittsburgh, then played two shows at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, before closing the tour with a concert in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The official bootlegs for the band's 2005 shows were distributed via Pearl Jam's official website in MP3 form. Pearl Jam also played a benefit concert to raise money for Hurricane Katrina relief on October 5, 2005, at the House of Blues in Chicago, Illinois. On November 22, 2005, Pearl Jam began its first Latin American tour. =Move to J Records and Pearl Jam (2006‚Äì2008)= Frontman Eddie Vedder in Pistoia, Italy on September 20, 2006 The work for Pearl Jam's follow-up to Riot Act began after its appearance on the 2004 Vote for Change tour. The time period between the two albums was the longest gap between Pearl Jam's studio albums to date and the new album was its first release for a new label. Clive Davis announced in February 2006 that Pearl Jam had signed with his label, J Records, which like Epic, is part of Sony Music Entertainment (then known as Sony BMG), though J has since folded into RCA Records. The band's eighth studio album, Pearl Jam, was released on May 2, 2006. A number of critics cited Pearl Jam as a return to the band's early sound, and McCready compared the new material to Vs. in a 2005 interview. Ament said, \\"The band playing in a room‚Äîthat came across. There's a kind of immediacy to the record, and that's what we were going for.\\"Porosky, Pamela. \\"Pearl Jam's Pop Art\\" . Bass Player. July 2006. Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly said that \\"in a world full of boys sent to do a man's job of rocking, Pearl Jam can still pull off gravitas.\\" Current socio- political issues in the United States are addressed on the album. \\"World Wide Suicide\\", a song criticizing the Iraq War and U.S. foreign policy, was released as a single and topped the Billboard Modern Rock chart; it was Pearl Jam's first number one on that chart since \\"Who You Are\\" in 1996, and first number one on any chart in the United States since 1998 when \\"Given to Fly\\" reached number one on the Mainstream Rock chart. Pearl Jam also included the singles \\"Life Wasted\\" and \\"Gone\\". To support Pearl Jam, the band embarked on its 2006 world tour. It toured North America, Australia and notably Europe; Pearl Jam had not toured the continent for six years. The North American tour included three two-night stands opening for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The band served as the headliners for the Leeds and Reading festivals, despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after Roskilde. Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the Leeds set that the band's decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde had nothing to do with \\"guts\\" but with trust in the audience. In 2007, Pearl Jam recorded a cover of The Who's \\"Love, Reign o'er Me\\" for the Mike Binder film, Reign Over Me; it was later made available as a music download on the iTunes Music Store. The band embarked on a 13-date European tour, and headlined Lollapalooza in Grant Park, on August 5, 2007. The band released a CD box set in June 2007, entitled Live at the Gorge 05/06, that documents its shows at The Gorge Amphitheatre, and in September 2007 a concert DVD, entitled Immagine in Cornice, which documents the band's Italian shows from its 2006 tour was released.

In the days prior to Election Day 2008, Pearl Jam digitally released through its official website a free documentary film, entitled Vote for Change? 2004, which follows the band's time spent on the 2004 Vote for Change tour. =Reissues and Backspacer (2009‚Äì2012)= In March 2009, Ten was reissued in four editions, featuring such extras as a remastering and remix of the entire album by Brendan O'Brien, a DVD of the band's 1992 appearance on MTV Unplugged, and an LP of its concert of September 20, 1992 at Magnuson Park in Seattle. It was the first reissue in a planned re-release of Pearl Jam's entire catalog that led up to the band's 20th anniversary in 2011. A Pearl Jam retrospective film directed by Cameron Crowe titled Pearl Jam Twenty was also planned to coincide with the anniversary. In 2011, Vs. and Vitalogy were reissued in the spring time in deluxe form. Pearl Jam began work for the follow-up to Pearl Jam in early 2008. In 2009, the band began to build on instrumental and demo tracks written during 2008. The band's ninth studio album, Backspacer, was its first to be produced by Brendan O'Brien since Yield. Backspacer debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard music charts, the band's first album to do so since No Code in 1996, and has sold 635,000 copies as of July 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The music on the record features a sound influenced by pop and new wave. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that \\"prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun.\\" Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, \\"I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now.\\" \\"The Fixer\\" was chosen as the album's first single.\\"Format Rooms: Modern Rock\\" . FMQB. Pearl Jam did not re-sign its record deal with J Records, and the band released the album through its own label Monkeywrench Records in the United States and through Universal Music Group internationally. Pearl Jam reached a deal with Target to be the exclusive big-box store retailer for the album in the United States. The album also saw release through the band's official website, independent record stores, online retailers, and iTunes. In an interview in September 2009 McCready revealed that Pearl Jam was scheduled to finish the Backspacer outtakes within six months, and told San Diego radio station KBZT that the band may release an EP in 2010 consisting of those songs, while Vedder instead suggested that the songs may be used for the band's next studio album. In August 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Virgin Festival, the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival, and played five shows in Europe and three in North America. In October 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Austin City Limits Music Festival. Later in October on Halloween night, the band played in what was the last performance at the Philadelphia Spectrum.

In September 2020, the band confirmed that their MTV Unplugged live set would be released on vinyl and CD for the first time the following month. Musical style and influences Compared with the other grunge bands of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's style is noticeably less heavy and harkens back to the classic rock music of the 1970s. Pearl Jam has cited many punk rock and classic rock bands as influences, including The Who, Led Zeppelin, Neil Young, Kiss and the Ramones. Pearl Jam's success has been attributed to its sound, which fuses \\"the riff-heavy stadium rock of the '70s with the grit and anger of '80s post- punk, without ever neglecting hooks and choruses.\\" Gossard's rhythm guitar style is known for its sense of beat and groove,Garbarini, Vic. \\"Mother of Pearl\\". Musician. May 1995. while McCready's lead guitar style, influenced by artists such as Jimi Hendrix,Rotondi, James. \\"Blood On the Tracks\\". Guitar Player. January 1994. has been described as \\"feel-oriented\\" and \\"rootsy.\\" Pearl Jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases. As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less catchy. He said, \\"I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes.\\" By 1994's Vitalogy, the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music. The band's 1996 album, No Code, was a deliberate break from the musical style of Ten. The songs on the album featured elements of garage rock, worldbeat, and experimentalism. After Yield in 1998, which was somewhat of a return to the straightforward rock approach of the band's early work, they dabbled with experimental art rock on the Binaural album of 2000, and with folk rock elements on the 2002 Riot Act album. The band's 2006 album, Pearl Jam, was cited as a return to their early sound. Their 2009 album, Backspacer, contains elements of pop and new wave. Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder's vocals as a \\"Jim Morrison-like vocal growl.\\"DeRogatis, p. 57. Greg Prato of AllMusic said, \\"With his hard-hitting and often confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also became one of the most copied lead singers in all of rock.\\" Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal (\\"Alive\\", \\"Better Man\\") to social and political concerns (\\"Even Flow\\", \\"World Wide Suicide\\"). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals.Tannenbaum, Rob. \\"Rebels Without a Pause\\". George. July 2000. When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, \\"Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that.\\"Cross, Charles R. \\"Better Man\\". Guitar World Presents: Guitar Legends: Pearl Jam. July 2006. Legacy While Nirvana had brought grunge to the mainstream in the early 1990s with Nevermind, Pearl Jam's debut Ten outsold it in the United States, and the band became \\"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s\\" according to AllMusic. Pearl Jam has been described as \\"modern rock radio's most influential stylists ‚Äì the workmanlike midtempo chug of songs like \\"Alive\\" and \\"Even Flow\\" just melodic enough to get moshers singing along.\\"Sinagra, Laura. \\"Grunge\\". Spin: 20 Years of Alternative Music. Three Rivers Press, 2005. , p. 150. The band inspired and influenced a number of bands, ranging from Silverchair to Puddle of Mudd and The Strokes. The band has also been credited for inspiring the indie rock scene of 90s-era urban Pakistan, that has since evolved into a rich rock music culture in the country. Pearl Jam were ranked at number 8 by Rolling Stone magazine in its Top Ten Live Acts of all Time issue. Pearl Jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic Jim DeRogatis said in the aftermath of the band's battle with Ticketmaster that it \\"proved that a rock band which isn't greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every last dime... it indicated that idealism in rock 'n' roll is not the sole province of those '60s bands enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\"DeRogatis, p. 66. Eric Weisbard of Spin said in 2001, \\"The group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a rock band as exists.\\" In a 2005 USA Today reader's poll, Pearl Jam was voted the greatest American rock band of all time. In April 2006, Pearl Jam was awarded the prize for \\"Best Live Act\\" in Esquire's Esky Music Awards. The blurb called Pearl Jam \\"the rare superstars who still play as though each show could be their last.\\" Pearl Jam's fanbase following has been compared to that of the Grateful Dead's, with Rolling Stone magazine stating that Pearl Jam \\"toured incessantly and became one of rock's great arena acts, attracting a fanatical, Grateful Dead-like cult following with marathon, true-believer shows in the vanishing spirit of Bruce Springsteen, the Who and U2.\\" When asked about Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, \\"I think at some point along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people something to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren't always easy, but I think we found a way.\\" Their 1992 MTV Unplugged performance was ranked second in Rolling Stone's list of its 15 Best Episodes. Campaigning and activism Throughout its career, Pearl Jam has promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-choice sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues. The band has promoted an array of causes, including awareness of Crohn's disease, which Mike McCready suffers from, Ticketmaster venue monopolization and the environment and wildlife protection, among others. Guitarist Stone Gossard has been active in environmental pursuits, and has been an advocate of Pearl Jam's carbon neutral policy, offsetting the band's environmental impact. Vedder has advocated for the release of the West Memphis 3 for years and Damien Echols, a member of the three, shares a writing credit for the song \\"Army Reserve\\" (from Pearl Jam). The band, and especially frontman Eddie Vedder, have been vocal supporters of the pro-choice movement. In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled \\"Reclamation\\", which detailed his views on abortion.Vedder, Eddie. \\"Reclamation\\". Spin. November 1992. In an MTV Unplugged concert the same year, Vedder stood on a stool and wrote \\"PRO-CHOICE!\\" on his arm in protest when the band performed the song \\"Porch\\". The band are members of a number of pro-choice organizations, including Choice USA and Voters for Choice. As members of Rock the Vote and Vote for Change, the band has encouraged voter registration and participation in United States elections. Vedder was outspoken in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000, and Pearl Jam played a series of concerts on the Vote for Change tour in October 2004, supporting the candidacy of John Kerry for U.S. president. In a Rolling Stone feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour's performers, Vedder told the magazine, \\"I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We have to get a new administration in.\\" In 2006, the members of Pearl Jam founded the non-profit organization Vitalogy Foundation. Named after their third studio album, the foundation supports non-profit organizations working in the fields of community health, the environment, arts, education and social change. Vedder sometimes comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy, and a number of his songs, including \\"Bu$hleaguer\\" and \\"World Wide Suicide\\", are openly critical of the Bush administration. At Lollapalooza 2007, Vedder spoke out against BP Amoco dumping effluent in Lake Michigan, and at the end of \\"Daughter\\", he sang the lyrics \\"George Bush leave this world alone/George Bush find yourself another home\\". In the beginning of the second encore Vedder invited Iraq war veteran Tomas Young, the subject of the documentary Body of War, onto the stage to urge an end to the war. Young in turn introduced Ben Harper, who contributed vocals to \\"No More\\" and \\"Rockin' in the Free World\\". The band later discovered that some of the Bush-related lyrics were excised from the AT&T; webcast of the event, and questioned whether that constitutes censorship. AT&T; later apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor Davie Brown Entertainment. Pearl Jam has performed numerous benefit concerts in aid of charities. For example, the band headlined a Seattle concert in 2001 to support the United Nations' efforts to combat world hunger. The band added a date at the Chicago House of Blues to its 2005 tour to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina; the concert proceeds were donated to Habitat for Humanity, the American Red Cross and the Jazz Foundation of America. In 2011, Pearl Jam was named 2011 Planet Defenders by Rock The Earth for their environmental activism and their large-scale efforts to decrease their own carbon emissions.

The goal of CSSSA is to provide a supportive environment in which students acquire experience and training that extends beyond the practice and improvement of aesthetics and technique. Artistic disciplines offered by the program include: animation, creative writing, dance, film and video, music (including vocal arts), theatre arts, and visual arts. Its purpose is to provide a training ground for future artists who wish to pursue careers in the arts and entertainment industries in California. Admitted students are designated California Arts Scholars, honored throughout the state's fifty-eight counties. Upon completion of the program, the students are awarded a Governor's Medallion, the highest distinction in California for artistically talented students. Founded in 1987, CSSSA is a California State agency funded through a unique public/private partnership.http://www.csssa.org/index.php/general-info/what/ Admissions Admission to the program is granted primarily to California state high school students, and up to twenty students from outside of California. The main criteria for admission is an applicant's potential for further professional development in the arts or creative fields after the end of the program. It's determined through an audition, portfolio review, screening, and teacher recommendations. Approximately one out of three applicants are accepted, parallel to the acceptance rate of CalArts. History During the early 1980s, California was facing increasing competition from other states in the arts and entertainment industry, which is its third-largest source for tax revenue. Film, television, and recording studio complexes, traditionally built in California, were being built in Florida, Texas, among other places. With diminishing interest in the commercial art sector, many of California's non- profit fine arts institutions and the state's educational community were feeling the effects of a financial backlash.History of CSSSA In 1982, a three-year effort by the state's legislature began to create an educational environment for California's young artists. State Senator Alan Sieroty sponsored legislation to begin the planning process. A 24-member Advisory Council of legislative, arts, and industry leaders was appointed by the California Arts Council and the State Board of Education to explore the cause of talent drain and recommend statewide educational opportunities. One of the problems that the Advisory Council discovered was that many of California's young talents were leaving California to attend art programs in New York, North Carolina, Michigan, and other states ‚Äî and would eventually stay to live and work there while they went to school. The research by the Council concluded on September 28, 1985 when Governor Deukmejian signed the bill, authored by State Senator John Garamendi, which created the California State Summer School for the Arts. The first session was held in the summer of 1987. The program would prove to be highly successful. By September 1990, Governor Deukmejian signed follow-up legislation to make it a permanent program of the state. By 1992, Governor Pete Wilson signed legislation to enable the program to accept a limited number of students from outside California, thereby making it a national program. =Program name= ‚ÄúInnerSpark‚Äù is an alternate name for CSSSA, which originated from the program itself. Students use both \\"InnerSpark\\" and \\"CSSSA\\" interchangeably. In 2010, the original name CSSSA (California State Summer School for the Arts) was reinstated as the official name for the program and is commonly used today. Student life CSSSA students stay in separate male and female dormitories of Chouinard Hall at the California Institute of the Arts. Each student shares a room with two to three roommates, and has two to three suitemates in an adjoining room, with whom they share a bathroom. The CalArts campus has spacious lawns with shade trees, open fields and large hillside areas, providing room for informal team sports and relaxation. Due to the extreme summer heat, these facilities are vital for CSSSA students.http://www.csssa.org/index.php/general-info/student-handbook/ =Identification Cards= Student pictures are taken during the first two days at CSSSA for I.D. cards, which must be worn at all times. Students use the I.D. card for authorization, food service in the cafeteria, recreation equipment, access into the library and supervised study and work areas. =Daily Newsletters= The Purple Blurrrb is a newsletter informing students of daily performances and other program-related events, which can be picked up by students in the cafeteria each morning. The name \\"Purple Blurrrb\\" originated at the first summer school in 1987, when it was printed on an old Ditto machine. The program now prints the newsletter on purple paper.http://www.csssa.org/index.php/parents/purple-blurrrb/ =Off Campus Visits= Students are generally not allowed to leave the CalArts campus, other than to go to two plazas located nearby. On Saturday evenings and Sundays, students can receive an off campus pass to leave campus overnight, with parent permission. Visitors can come on campus with a visitor pass that students apply for, but are not allowed in dorms or around the pool. Additionally, the program organizes three weekend field trips that students can choose to attend. Destinations have included theater and/or musical productions, Disneyland, Six Flags Magic Mountain and the Getty museum. =College Credit= After successful completion of the program, students are eligible to receive three semester units of California State University course credit through the Office of Extended Education at Humboldt State University. These credits can be used as elective units toward a bachelor's degree at any of the campuses in the California State University system. They are also generally transferable to other colleges and universities throughout the United States. Faculty CSSSA faculty is composed of professional artists and arts educators who specialize in the artistic disciplines taught at the program. Faculty members are selected on the basis of artistic excellence in their art forms as well as their teaching abilities. Housing for the faculty is located on the east side of the campus in Ahmanson Hall. Resident Assistants Throughout the summer session, Resident Assistants (\\"RAs\\"), help students become more familiar with campus and residential life. RAs are responsible for managing residence halls after office hours and during the evening, and are assigned a room on the same floor where they do room checks on students. RAs are typically CalArts students.

Early life and education Gutmann was born in 1905 in Breslau, Germany (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland) to an upper-middle-class Jewish family. He earned a degree in art from and moved to Berlin in 1927, earning a post- graduate degree at Preussisches Shulkollegium for Hohere Erziehung. Career Being Jewish, he was unable to exhibit his paintings or get a job teaching in Nazi Germany, and so he emigrated to the United States, arriving in San Francisco in late 1933. Gutmann reinvented himself as a photographer before he left Germany, purchasing a Rolleiflex and signing a photojournalism contract with Presse-Photo in 1933. He continued to work as a photojournalist for Presse-Photo from the West Coast until he signed on with PIX in 1936, an agency he worked with until 1962. After arriving in San Francisco, one of the first news stories he documented was the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike. His work on other stories was later published in popular contemporary newsmagazines such as Time, Look, and The Saturday Evening Post. Some of his photographs of the Golden Gate International Exposition were published in Life in 1939. At the same time, he started teaching at San Francisco State College in 1936 and founded the photography department there in 1946. In between, Gutmann served with the United States Office of War Information during World War II. Gutmann taught at SF State until 1973. After his retirement, he began printing images from his archives, and began exhibiting his work at the Fraenkel Gallery and Castelli Graphics in the late 1970s. His work was later packaged into a traveling exhibition, \\"Beyond the Document\\", which moved from SFMOMA to the Museum of Modern Art and Los Angeles County Museum of Art starting in 1989. Style Gutmann's main subject matter was the American way of life, especially the Jazz music scene. Gutmann is recognized for his unique \\"worm's-eye view\\" camera angle. He enjoyed taking photos of ordinary things and making them seem special. Kenneth Baker, art critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, wrote in 1997 that Gutmann was \\"an emissary of European modernism\\" who \\"brought a distinct angle of vision to the American scene\\" and his images demonstrated his \\"excitement of his witness to the [Depression-era] times\\". David Bonetti, art critic for the San Francisco Examiner, called Gutmann's output from the 1930s \\"his best‚Äìwhen, a young Jewish refugee, he experienced America as a bemused stranger in a strange land. Gutmann fell in love with Depression-era America, which he traveled by Greyhound Bus Line. He saw its cars, its rites and festival, its athletes, its women, its vibrant African American communities and its dynamic street life with European eyes.\\" Awards Gutmann received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1977. Legacy He created the John Gutmann Photography Fellowship Award, through the San Francisco Foundation.

The church is considered part of First State National Historical Park. The church, which is often visited by tourists, remains open today for tours and religious activities. History The church was built in 1698‚Äì99 in territory that had been the colony of New Sweden until 1655. The building materials were local blue granite and Swedish bricks that had been used as ship's ballast. The church is situated on the site of the Fort Christina's burial ground, which dates to 1638. The church claims to be \\"the nation's oldest church building still used for worship as originally built\\". There are reportedly over 15,000 burials in the churchyard. Lutheran Church services were held in the Swedish language well into the 18th century.Old Swedes Episcopal Church, Wilmington, DE In 1697, the Church of Sweden renewed its commitment to Swedish settlers in the Delaware Valley and sent three missionaries, Jonas Auren, Eric Bjork, and Andreas Rudman, to the area. A total of three churches with similar architecture were built or established by Swedish communities in the area about the same time. All are generally known as \\"Old Swedes\\", and later joined the Episcopal Church. Holy Trinity in Wilmington was built in 1699. Gloria Dei (Old Swedes') Church in Philadelphia, about 30 miles away, was founded in 1677 and the building was completed in 1700. Trinity Church in Swedesboro, New Jersey, about 20 miles away by modern roads, was founded in 1703, with its current building completed in 1784.

Holy Trinity in Wilmington has housed an Episcopal parish since 1791 and is now part of the Episcopal Diocese of Delaware.

Both the hundred and the manor with the same name are mentioned in the Domesday Book. A number of parishes in the western part of the Barstable hundred are now in Thurrock. Location Part of plate XXII from the Chapman & Andre 1777 map of Essex showing the location of Barstable Hall and Little Barstable Hall Barstable is bordered on the east by Rochford hundred; on the north by Chelmsford hundred; on the north-west by the Ongar hundred; on the west by Chafford hundred (with the boundary in part following the Mardyke) and on the south by the river Thames. The parish boundary between Grays Thurrock and Little Thurrock is also the hundred boundary between Barstable and Chafford. The interlocking boundary between these parishes suggests the existence of a common pasture originally shared, prior to the establishment of the hundred boundary. Name The name of the hundred was normally that of its meeting-place. Barstaple hundred takes its name from a location or settlement that is now in Basildon new town. This is mentioned as the manor of Barstable Hall, as Little Barstable Hall and as Barstable Hall, alias Basildon Hall. Ernest Godman, writing in Home Counties magazine quotes Morant, as saying the name \\"appears to have been taken from the place now called Barstable Hall, in Langdon and Basildon ... which being near the centre of the Hundred, was then the most convenient place for holding Courts, and transacting all affairs of a public nature.\\" The name of the hundred is frequently written as Barnstable in older documents. The name appears as Berdestapla in Domesday. Reaney suggests that the first element of the place-name may be a person, or a descriptive adjective. However, more recent work suggests it comes from berde ‚Äì a battle axe. The second element means a post or pillar. The post would have marked the meeting place for the hundred. Meeting point During the Saxon period, the men of the hundred met to discuss local issues and to conduct judicial trials. The moot site for the Barstable hundred was said to be close to the former Barstable Hall.J K Payne, Basildon old and new, in Essex Countryside, volume 3, number 11 Reaney says, \\"The old hall was near the junction of the boundaries of the parishes of Laindon, Corringham, Vange and Basildon\\", but there is no common boundary involving Corringham, Laindon and Vange. A Laindon court roll, dated 1573, mentions a motehill. If the location of the meeting place was close to the site of the now demolished Basildon Hall, it would have been in Basildon parish, about from the boundary with the parish of Vange.Map showing location of site of Basildon Hall According to Godman, \\"the manor-house had disappeared before Morant's time, a farmhouse being built in a lower situation. This has been in its turn deserted, and the buildings now remaining are of a fragmentary nature.\\"Notes on Laindon cum Basildon Anderson says \\"the original hall stood further south\\", \\"at the highest point in parish\\". According to another source, this was destroyed by an explosion in 1834.Hunting for Historic Basildon and may now be under the railway line. The original location would have been close to the geographic centre of the hundred. The modern district of Barstable in Basildon new town is largely in the traditional parish of Vange. However, David Roffe notes that the Hundred Rolls for the Barstaple hundred were the verdicts of a hundred court held at Horndon on the Hill.Hundred Rolls Parishes Canvey Island, which was also in the Barstable hundred, was divided among a number of nearby parishes.

Blue SWAT deviated from the Metal Hero trend by using a realistic vibe for the series instead of fantastic, over-the-top action by focusing on the martial arts and gunplay aspects of the series. While the mood of the series appealed to the genre's adult fanbase and older viewers, the show was not well received by children, which resulted in a change into a lighter tone midway through the series. The Blue SWAT team later appeared for a special team-up in the final episodes of Juukou B-Fighter. Plot When Earth is tearing itself apart by means of crime, pollution and war, aliens choose the time to invade, taking advantage of the lowering of everyone's guard. The Japanese government establishes an elite police organization known as Blue SWAT to combat the aliens, known as the Space Mafia. The aliens attack by possessing humans to obtain their goals. When an alien possesses the chief of the Blue SWAT unit to infiltrate the organization, it manages to completely demolish their building of operations and murder all but three SWAT members; Sho, Sara and Sig. Managing to keep the suits and equipment assigned to them, the three form their own private detective-like agency called Blue Research to continue their mission of defeating the Space Mafia.

After being wounded and showing green blood in a battle with an Alien, he reveals that he was part of the Space S.W.A.T., and an alien from a planet devastated by the Space Mafia. He came to Earth and possessed the cadaver of , a brain-dead organ donor involved in a traffic accident, in order to survive on the planet and fight the Space Mafia. Although his identity as an Alien originally results in suspicion from Sho and Sara, he quickly earns their trust. In a twist of events, Gou had a son named Zaji who, comatose after being involved in the same accident as Gou, is being possessed by a member of the Space Mafia named Jisp. Sig is, in truth, 800 Earth years old. * : A computer nerd who assists the Blue SWAT in their Blue Research group after he was saved by them.

The most common types of aliens that Blue SWAT encounters, and typically work in packs of three. Each alien liquefies their body and invades a human being via the mouth. Each type can materialize a mini-computer on their arms to communicate with one another. The Bona types can elongate their arms and fingers. The Kell types have the ability to cloak themselves.

During his first confrontation with Blue SWAT, Sho was accidentally doused with a chemical that would make him explode. To prevent Sho from getting an antidote, Mougu possessed any vehicle and weapon Sho tried to use. Seiji was able to get the antidote to Sho in time while Sig and Sarah fought Mougu. Hyper Sho dealt the final blow and destroyed Mougu with his Dictator. Mougu was voiced by Wataru Abe (ÈòøÈÉ®Ê∏° Abe Wataru?), who also voiced the Byakkoshinken from Gosei Sentai Dairanger. Mademoiselle Eva („Éû„Éâ„É¢„Ç¢„Çº„É´„Éª„Ç®„Éê Madomoazeru Eba?), under Queen's orders, was sent to terminate Jisp for his repeated failures to conquer the Earth for the Space Mafia. Ironically, she was destroyed by Jisp. Eva was portrayed by Mayumi Tateishi (Á´ãÁü≥„Åæ„ÇÜ„Åø Tateishi Mayumi?). Zaiba During her tenure with the LAPD, Sarah and her old partner John encountered a Zaiba, which was too powerful against Earth firearms. In their fight, John sacrificed himself to save Sarah. Sig also had history with this Zaiba during his time with Space SWAT. The Zaiba reappeared in present day and invaded the body of a cyborg called the TR-99 which had a protective barrier to shield the Zaiba from the Dictators. Using gunpowder to set off an explosion, Sarah and Sig were able to damage the TR-99 and locate the its weakpoint and destroy it. With the TR-99's barrier out of commission, Sarah and Sig destroyed the Zaiba with their Dictators. Additional Zaiba types appeared with various colored heads. Yanimi („É§„Éã„Éü Yanimi?) is Jisp's third subordinate, armed with a bone scythe. In her human form, Yanimi was capable of utilizing wrestling moves against Blue SWAT. In her last stand against Blue SWAT, Yanimi masqueraded as Otohime from the legend of Urashima Taro to sucker a scientist into helping her create deadly turtles that would latch on to people and explode. Yanimi was destroyed by each SWAT's Dictators Yanimi's human host was portrayed by pro female wrestler Mitsuko Nishiwaki (Ë•øËÑáÂÖÖÂ≠ê Nishiwaki Mitsuko?), credited as MIZKO.

The book was originally intended to revive Hemingway‚Äôs reputation after the negative reviews of Across the River and Into the Trees. He began writing it in 1950 and advanced greatly through 1951. The work, rough but seemingly finished, was found by Mary Hemingway among 332 works Hemingway left behind at his death. Islands in the Stream was meant to encompass three stories to illustrate different stages in the life of its main character, Thomas Hudson. The three different parts of the novel were originally to be titled \\"The Sea When Young\\", \\"The Sea When Absent\\" and \\"The Sea in Being\\". These titles were changed, however, into what are now its three acts: \\"Bimini\\", \\"Cuba\\", and \\"At Sea\\". Background Early in 1950 Hemingway started work on a \\"sea trilogy\\", to consist of three sections: \\"The Sea When Young\\" (set in Bimini); \\"The Sea When Absent\\" (set in Havana); and \\"The Sea in Being\\" (set at sea). He also wrote an unpublished story, \\"Sea-Chase\\", which his wife and editor combined with the previous stories about the islands, renamed them as Islands in the Stream, which was published in 1970. Plot The first act, \\"Bimini\\", begins with an introduction to the character of Thomas Hudson, a typical Hemingway stoic male figure. Hudson is a renowned American painter who finds tranquility on the island of Bimini, in the Bahamas, a far cry from his usual adventurous lifestyle. Hudson‚Äôs strict routine of work is interrupted when his three sons arrive for the summer and is the setting for most of the act. Also introduced in this act is the character of Roger Davis, a writer, one of Hudson‚Äôs oldest friends. Though similar to Hudson, by struggling with an unmentioned internal conflict, Davis seems to act as a more dynamic and outgoing image of Hudson‚Äôs character. The act ends with Hudson receiving news of the death of his two youngest children soon after they leave the island. \\"Cuba\\" takes place soon thereafter during the Second World War in Havana, Cuba where the reader is introduced to an older and more distant Hudson who has just received news of his oldest (and last) son‚Äôs death in the war. This second act introduces us to a more cynical and introverted Hudson who spends his days on the island drinking heavily and doing naval reconnaissance for the US military aboard Hudson's yacht, converted to an auxiliary patrol boat. \\"At Sea\\", the final act, follows Hudson and a team of irregulars aboard their boat as they track and pursue survivors of a sunken German U-boat along the Jardines del Rey archipelago on the northern coast of Cuba. Hudson becomes intent on finding the fleeing Germans after he finds they massacred an entire village to cover their escape. The novel ends with a shoot-out and the destruction of the Germans in one of the tidal channels surrounding Cayo Guillermo. Hudson is presumably mortally wounded in the gun battle, although the ending is slightly ambiguous. During the chase, Hudson stops questioning the deaths of his children. This chapter rings heavily with influences of Hemingway‚Äôs earlier work For Whom the Bell Tolls. Real life influences Henry Strater and Hemingway in Bimini Hemingway used many of his real life experiences, friends, and relatives, to form his stories and base his characters on. =Henry \\"Mike\\" Strater= Henry Strater, an American painter, spent the summer with Hemingway fishing on Bimini in 1935. He is shown in the adjacent picture standing next to what was believed to be a 1,000 pound Marlin that had been half eaten by sharks while Strater landed the fish. =Gerald and Sara Murphy= While on Bimini, Gerald and Sara Murphy, good friends of Hemingway, lost their young son, Baoth, to illness. Hemingway's grief for the loss is captured in letters to the Murphys. =Hunting for U-boats= During WW II, Hemingway hunted for U-Boats aboard his boat Pilar. His boat was outfitted with communications gear provided by the US Embassy in Havana. In pop culture The plot of the song \\"A Quiet Night for our Forces at Suez\\" by Israeli singer Meir Ariel revolves around an IDF soldier reading the book during his tour of duty at Suez, intertwined with the events of the book.

According to the Irish Audiovisual Content Production Sector Review carried out by the Irish Film Board and PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2008 this sector, has gone from 1,000 people employed six or seven years ago, to well over 6,000 people in that sector now and is valued at over ‚Ç¨557.3 million and represents 0.3% of GDP. Most films are produced in English as Ireland is largely Anglophone, though some productions are made in Irish either wholly or partially. According to an article in Variety magazine spotlighting Irish cinema, a decade ago the Republic of Ireland had only two filmmakers anyone had heard of: Neil Jordan and Jim Sheridan. , the Republic of Ireland can boast more than a dozen directors and writers with significant and growing international reputations. Ireland is now achieving critical mass of filmmaking talent to match the kind of influence, disproportionate to its small size, that it has always enjoyed in the fields of literature and theatre. Following in the footsteps of Sheridan and Jordan comes a generation that includes such directors as Lenny Abrahamson, Conor McPherson, John Crowley, Martin McDonagh, John Michael McDonagh, John Carney, Kirsten Sheridan, Lance Daly, Paddy Breathnach and Damien O'Donnell and writers such as Mark O'Rowe, Enda Walsh and Mark O'Halloran. Former Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism Martin Cullen (2008‚Äì2010) said that ‚Äúthe film industry is the cornerstone of a smart and creative digital economy‚Äù. But as well as the concrete economic benefits that the Irish film industry brings in by way of cash investment from overseas and the associated VAT, PAYE and PRSI receipts, it has been noted that there are the soft benefits in terms of the development and projection of the Irish culture and the promotion of tourism. While big- budget international productions keep crews working and are enormously valuable to the country, it is the indigenous industry that is at the heart of creating opportunity and giving skills and experience to Irish producers, directors, writers and crew, telling the stories that emerge from Irish-based talent. Some of the most successful Irish films include The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006), Intermission (2003), Man About Dog (2004), Michael Collins (1996), Angela's Ashes (1999), The Commitments (1991), Once (2007) and Notorious (2017). Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie (2014) holds the record for the biggest gross on the opening day of an Irish film in Ireland. Notorious (2017) on the other hand holds the record for highest grossing Irish documentary of all time. In the past many films were censored or banned, owing largely to the influence of the Catholic Church with films including The Great Dictator (1940), A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Life of Brian (1979) being banned at various times,\\"Ten films that Ireland banned under the 1923 Censorship Act,\\" The Irish Post, 2015 although virtually no cuts or bans have been issued in recent years, one as of August 2006. The Irish Film Censor's Office policy is that of personal choice for the viewer, considering his job to examine and classify films rather than censor them.  Ireland as a location  The first fictional film shot in Ireland was Kalem Company's The Lad from Old Ireland (1910), which was also the first American film shot on location outside the United States. It was directed by Sidney Olcott, who returned the next year to shoot over a dozen films primarily in the small village of Beaufort, County Kerry. Olcott intended to start a permanent studio in Beaufort, but the outbreak of World War I prevented him from doing so. The Irish government was one of the first in Europe to see the potential benefit to the exchequer of having a competitive tax incentive for investment in film and television, making use of a revised and improved version of its Section 481 tax incentive in 2015 which gives production companies a tax credit rate of 32% when making certain films. Other countries have recognized the success of Ireland‚Äôs incentive scheme and matched it or introduced a more competitive tax incentive. After a long lobbying process, significant improvements were introduced to the Section 481 relief for investment in film projects in 2009 to boost employment in the industry and help re-establish Ireland as an attractive global location for film and television production. Kevin Moriarty, managing director of Ardmore Studios believes Ireland is an attractive film location as there is now recognition for the quality of the output of the Irish film industry and a perception that Ireland is a viable film destination. Prominent films that have been filmed in Ireland include The Quiet Man (1952), The Lion in Winter (1968), The First Great Train Robbery (1979), Excalibur (1981), Braveheart (1995), Reign of Fire (2002), King Arthur (2004), The Guard (2011), Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), and Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017).  Cinemas in Ireland  The Ambassador Cinema was in use, on and off, as a cinema from about 1910 to 1999, and is now a music venue at the top of O'Connell Street, Dublin. The first cinema in Ireland, the Volta, was opened at 45 Mary Street, Dublin, in 1909 by the novelist James Joyce. Ireland has a high rate of cinema admissions (the highest in Europe). There are several cinema chains operating in Ireland. Among them are ODEON Cinemas (formerly UCI/Storm Cinemas), Omniplex, IMC Cinemas (Both Omniplex and IMC are owned by the Ward Anderson group), Cineworld, Vue and Movies@Cinemas.  Studios  Ardmore Studios was the first Irish studio, opening in 1958 in Bray, County Wicklow.  Animated films  Ireland has been home to several noteworthy producers of animated films in recent years. Sullivan Bluth Studios was opened in 1979 as Don Bluth Productions, with its primary location in Dublin, to produce animated films by director Don Bluth and producer Morris Sullivan. Some films produced at Sullivan Bluth's Irish studio include 1988's The Land Before Time, 1989's All Dogs Go to Heaven (co-produced with UK-based Goldcrest Films) and 1991's Rock-a-Doodle. Many of these films competed favourably with productions by Walt Disney Pictures at the time. However, following a number of box-office flops in the early to mid-1990s, including 1994's Thumbelina and A Troll in Central Park and 1995's The Pebble and the Penguin, the studio soon declared bankruptcy and was closed in 1995. Today, Ireland has a number of animation studios that produce television and commercial animation, as well as feature films and co-productions. Cartoon Saloon, founded in 1999 by Paul Young and Tomm Moore, is among the most prolific. It has produced the award-winning TV series Skunk Fu! as well as a feature film, 2009's The Secret of Kells, animated primarily with Traditional paper and pencil hand drawn animation and detailing a fictitious account of the creation of the Book of Kells. The film was nominated at the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature. Cartoon Saloon has more feature films in production, including Song of the Sea, released in 2014.  Legislation  Irish Air Corps pilots filming Roger Corman‚Äôs Richthofen & Brown, 1970. Lynn Garrison second from right, front row The Film Act of 1970 set the foundation for an expanding Irish-based film industry. It provided, among other things, very advantageous tax advantages for film productions and resident foreign creative individuals. A number of world-renowned writers, including Len Deighton, Frederick Forsyth, and Richard Condon took advantage of the allowances, residing in Ireland for a number of years. The Film Act of 1970 was the result of an initial collaboration between Taoiseach Jack Lynch and Lynn Garrison, an aerial film director who shared a semi-detached with the Prime Minister. The Film Act of 1970 became the basis for other national film acts throughout Europe and America.  Irish Film Board  Bord Scann√°n na h√âireann/the Irish Film Board (IFB) is the national development agency for the Irish film industry investing in talent, creativity and enterprise. The agency supports and promotes the Irish film industry and the use of Ireland as a location for international production. The Irish Film Board was set up in 1981 to boost the local industry, and one of its earliest supported projects was The Outcasts in 1982. After the infamous closure of the Irish Film Board in 1987, Irish stories and filmmakers continued to break through with considerable international success My Left Foot (Jim Sheridan), The Crying Game (Neil Jordan), The Commitments (Alan Parker) all made with non-Irish finance. The success of these projects coupled with intensive local lobbying led to the re-establishment of the Irish Film Board in 1993. Many film critics point to the fact that the Irish Film Board's output has been poor, as most films which are chosen for funding do little or no business outside of the country, and are rarely popular in Ireland. However, IFB funded films like Intermission, I Went Down, Man About Dog, The Wind That Shakes The Barley, and Adam & Paul have proved popular with domestic audiences and have all done respectable business in Irish cinemas. Both the Oscar-winning film Once and the Palme d'Or winner The Wind That Shakes the Barley have experienced international success over the last couple of years. Once, which was made on a shoestring budget, took over $10 million at the US box office and over $20 million in worldwide ticket sales, while The Wind That Shakes the Barley was distributed theatrically in 40 territories worldwide. Over the last four years Irish films have screened and won awards at the top international film festivals including Cannes, Sundance, Berlin, Toronto, Venice, London, Tribeca, Edinburgh and Pusan. The Wind That Shakes The Barley won the prestigious Palme d'Or award for Best Film at the Cannes Film Festival in 2006, while Garage, directed by Lenny Abrahamson, picked up the CICEA Award at the Directors Fortnight at the festival in 2007. After winning the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007, Once went on to win the Best Foreign Film prize at the Independent Spirit Awards in 2008 and an Academy Award for Best Original Song. The Irish short film Six Shooter won the Academy Award for Best Short Film in 2006 while the short film New Boy was nominated for the same award in 2009. In 2009 a record seven IFB funded films (Ondine, Perrier‚Äôs Bounty, Triage, A Shine of Rainbows, Eamon, Cracks, and Colony) had officially been selected for the Toronto International Film Festival. Tony Keily has criticised the board's insistence on funding \\"uncommercial commercial cinema\\". Paul Melia has also criticised the IFB over its slowness in awarding funding. The Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism Martin Cullen addressed the issue of commercial success recently saying that ‚ÄúThe film board offers the chance to make films for a small audience and not necessarily for big commercial success but which have real quality. That offers opportunity to people who can go on to make their mark. Whether that is the actors, the director or crew, many of the people who work on those films wouldn‚Äôt go on to success unless they had been given their first chance here. People can only get experience by giving them the opportunity‚Äù.  2005 Top 10 poll  In 2005 a Jameson Whiskey-sponsored poll selected the top 10 Irish films: the results are below. # The Commitments (1991) # My Left Foot (1989) # In the Name of the Father (1993) # The Quiet Man (1952) # The Snapper (1993) # Michael Collins (1996) # The Field (1990) # Intermission (2003) # Veronica Guerin (2003) # Inside I'm Dancing (2004) Critically acclaimed Irish films released since this poll was taken include The Wind That Shakes the Barley, Once, The Secret of Kells, Song of the Sea, Garage, The Guard, and Brooklyn.

His documentary work includes Atlantean, a series of four documentaries about the origins of the Irish people. Quinn has a history of protesting the commercialisation of television, resigning from RT√â in 1969 on that basis and resigning from the RT√â Authority in 1999 to protest toy advertising. He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Irish Film Institute in 2001 and is a member of the Aosd√°na. Early life and television career Quinn was born in Dublin in 1935. After a series of other jobs, he moved into television in 1961, joining Ireland's national public-service television station, RT√â, as a trainee studio operator the year it first broadcast. He worked up to directing films there, but resigned in 1969 in protest against the commercialisation of the network. He wrote his first book, Sit Down and be Counted with Lelia Doolan and Jack Dowley, who had also quit, about that episode. In 1973, he established his own production company, Cinegael, in Carraroe, County Galway, together with a cinema by the same name, in which Quinn and his family lived. In June 1995, Quinn was appointed to the RT√â Authority. After he criticised RT√â on Tonight With Vincent Browne, on RT√â Radio 1, on 7 November 1996, he was removed from the panel interviewing candidates to be Director-General of RT√â. Quinn had also been part of the campaign that led to the launch of TnaG, now TG4, on 31 October 1996. While on the Authority, he suspended his own membership every Christmas to protest RT√â's reliance on toy advertising aimed at children, and he quit the Authority in July 1999, saying that \\"to brainwash children is simply unacceptable and the pressure it puts on parents to buy these products is simply scandalous\\" and that RT√â needed to do more to represent regions of Ireland outside the capital, Dublin. Filmmaking In 1978, Quinn made Poit√≠n, which was the first feature film ever made entirely in the Irish language. It was also the first feature film to receive funding from the Arts Council of Ireland. The film was a story about an illegal distiller of poit√≠n in rural Connemara and starred Cyril Cusack, Donal McCann and Niall T√≥ib√≠n. The premiere was held in Carraroe. Quinn's 1978 documentary The Family, a profile of the Atlantis commune made for RT√â, was considered too disturbing to air and was not broadcast until the 1991. It was featured at the 2017 Tulca Festival of Visual Arts in Galway, which was themed around the commune nicknamed The Screamers. In 1986, Quinn wrote the script that he made into Budawanny in 1987 and for which he was awarded an Arts Council Film Script Award. Based on the 1983 novel Suil le Breith (\\"About Us\\") by , it tells the story of a parish priest on a Gaeltacht island who gets his housekeeper, Marion, pregnant and wrestles with his love for her and his commitment to the priesthood and his community. In 1994 he revisited Budawanny to make The Bishop's Story, in which the priest of Budawanny is now an older bishop at a retreat house and recounts his story to a younger priest who is there to address his own alcoholism and paedophilia. The flashbacks to the earlier events are told using material from Budawanny. In July 1989, Quinn founded the Galway Film Fleadh with Lelia Doolan, Miriam Allen, Joe MacMahon and Steve Woods. The first Fleadh was held at the Claddagh Palace. Awards and recognition Quinn received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Irish Film Institute in 2001. He is a member of the Aosd√°na. Exhibitions and retrospectives In 2010, Quinn donated 25,000 of his negatives, taken over a period of 40 years, to the library of the National University of Ireland Galway. A selection were put on temporary display at Galway City Museum. TG4 aired a 13-week retrospective of Quinn's work beginning in October 2011. The first annual Clare Island Film Festival was a retrospective of Quinn's films in 2013. Two of Quinn's films are at the New York Museum of Modern Art. Family life Quinn has six children and (as of 2017) ten grandchildren. His son, Robert, is also a filmmaker. He made the film documentary Cinegael Paradiso about his childhood and his father's work in 2004.

Biography  Eichberg was born in Stuttgart, Germany. He studied piano, composition and orchestra conducting in Copenhagen, Cologne and Berlin. He had his first break-through in 2001 when winning the Queen Elisabeth Competition for Composers in Brussels in 2001. Other awards and honours include the Tanglewood fellowship, the German Konrad-Adenauer Composition Grant and the Composition Stipend of the Danish Arts Foundation. In 2010 he was announced as the first composer-in-residence of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra in the orchestra's history., which lead to a close collaboration with the orchestra over five years and several large scale works being premiered and recorded. His symphonic work was in 2017 shortlisted for the German Music Authors' Prize. Hilary Hahn recorded his composition Levitation for her Deutsche Grammophon album In 27 Pieces: The Hilary Hahn Encores, which was awarded a Grammy Award in 2014. His works include three symphonies, concertos, three operas and solo- and chamber music and are published by Universal Edition and Edition Wilhelm Hansen (MusicSales). He collaborates with Ensemble Modern, Mahler Chamber Orchestra and several radio orchestras across Europe.

As a guest lecturer he has been invited by Guildhall School of Music and Drama, Ya≈üar University and hdpk Berlin.  Glare  Eichberg's chamber opera Glare, with libretto by Hannah D√ºbgen, was commissioned by Royal Opera House and opened in London in November 2014. Glare is a psycho-drama chamber-play with elements of science fiction, which focuses on the relationships between four protagonists one of who may or may not be an artificial human. It gained attention among bloggers, twitterers and the press with some calling it unnecessary violent or even misogynist, while others praised it as the perfect opera for the digital age. Richard Morrison in his review in The Times gave it 5 out of 5 stars saying that he couldn't remember a more gripping 75 minutes of avant-garde music-theatre than Glare. The opera has since been staged in Koblenz and Riksteatern. Eichberg's follow-up opera about the European refugee crisis premiered at Staatstheater Wiesbaden in September 2017.

Denim skirts come in a variety of styles and lengths to suit different populations and occasions. For example, full-length denim skirts are commonly worn by women whose religious beliefs prohibit them from wearing trousers, including Orthodox Jews, some Muslims, Mennonites, and Pentecostals, among others. Shorter skirts made of denim are commonly worn by teenagers and young adults. Some are modeled after an exact style of jeans, with a front fly, belt loops, and back pockets. Others are constructed more like other types of skirts, with a column of front button, closures on the side or back, or elastic waists. Like jeans, denim skirts vary in shades of blue, ranging from very pale to very dark, or occasionally in other colors. During winter and colder months, denim skirts are often worn with leggings or tights. History In the 1960s, hippies first came up with the idea of recycling old denim jeans into long denim skirts, by opening the inseams, and inserting pieces of triangular denim (or any other fabric) in the front and, unless a tall slit in back is preferred, also in the back of the opened-up trousers.Cain, Chelsea. 2004.

Asheville, NC, New York: Lark Books, A Division of Sterling Publishing Co. 1st edition. (pbk), pp. 18-19: Forever in Blue Jeans Skirt (Designer: Joan Morris) Denim skirts were first introduced in mainstream fashion lines in the 1970s, and since then have grown in popularity. Circa-1983, denim miniskirts‚Äîwith a pencil skirt silhouette‚Äîbecame a popular teenage fashion. They were initially in darker blues, but eventually pinstripes (light blue on darker blue, red on black) and acid wash. The trend faded in the late 1980s when knit miniskirts were dominant. Denim miniskirts reemerged in the latter portion of the 1990s. Marnie Bjornson, a well-known figure in the Reykjavik style scene, is credited with reinvigorating the denim skirt in 1996. The same year, Pamela Anderson wore a light washed denim skirt in a promotional photo shoot for the film Barb Wire. The denim miniskirt of the early 21st century was shorter than its 1980s counterpart. Styles of denim skirt The classic style of a denim skirt resembles a common pair of jeans, with a front fly, a fitted waist, belt loops, and pockets. There have been a large number of other styles constructed over time to resemble other types of skirts. Several types of skirts are more common in denim than in other fabrics‚Äîthey typically include skirts with a variety of panels, going beyond the four panels most common with other fabrics. These include chevron, diagonal, diamond, horizontal, multiple vertical panels, and combinations of the above. Denim skirts not made from pants are often designed as though they were made from pants, i.e. with front and back triangular denim panels. To tone down the rough and somewhat masculine look of the denim fabric, denim skirts are sometimes designed with alternating cloth panels, which can be diagonal, triangular, vertical, or there can be cloth panel trim at the bottom of the skirt. Also, to make the skirt look more feminine, denim skirts are (more often than skirts made from other fabrics), trimmed with fringes, lace, leather fringes, or decorated with embroidery, patchwork, rhinestones, writing, or even painting. Prints are quite rare on denim skirts. Deviating from the front fly and button closure is common though, with back or side zippers or a column of front buttons (on a \\"fake\\" fly) being common. One style denim skirts share with jeans is the ripped or destroyed look, which is more common with short denim skirts than with long ones. Another style shared with jeans and jeans cutoffs, but maybe even more popular in denim skirts, is the rough hem. This is achieved by not hemming the skirt (or undoing or cutting off the existing hem) and washing the skirt by machine several times. The resulting edge of the skirt will have a frayed or unraveling look, popular with teenagers and young women. The longer unraveled threads are usually cut off for an even fuzzy look, but some teenagers leave them hanging on their shorter skirts.

Released in Japan on October 27, 2011, Type-0 is part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries, a set of games sharing a common mythos which includes Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XV. The gameplay, similar to Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, has the player taking control of characters in real-time combat during missions across Orience. The player also engages in large-scale strategy-based battles on the world map, and has access to a multiplayer option during story missions and side quests. The story focuses on Class Zero, a group of fourteen students from the Vermillion Peristylium, a magical academy in the Dominion of Rubrum. When the Militesi Empire launches an assault on the other Crystal States of Orience, seeking to control their respective crystals, Class Zero is mobilized for the defense of Rubrum. Eventually, the group becomes entangled in the secrets behind both the war and the reason for their existence. The setting and presentation were inspired by historical documentaries, and the story itself was written to be darker than other Final Fantasy titles. The game was originally announced as a title for mobile phones and the PSP called It was directed by Hajime Tabata, who took up the project after completing Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII. Initially designed to provide players with easy access to the Fabula Nova Crystallis universe, the mobile version was eventually cancelled and the game's title was changed to distance it from the subseries' flagship title Final Fantasy XIII. Releasing to strong sales, it received praise for its story and gameplay, but was criticized for its camera control and artificial intelligence. Further games related to Type-0 have also been developed, including a high definition remaster that released internationally in March 2015. Gameplay Final Fantasy Type-0 is an action role-playing game in which the player controls the 14 members of Class Zero, who are sent on missions across Orience. Outside environments such as the Vermillion Peristylium (Class Zero's home base) and dedicated missions, the game world of Orience is navigated via a scaled-down world map. Class Zero are sent on missions across Orience during the course of the game. The player initially travels to preset destinations in the world on an airship supplied by the Peristylium, but gains their own airship to freely navigate the world map with after defeating a powerful enemy guarding it. The main gameplay is presented in a mission-based structure. The two types of missions encountered are story- based missions, and \\"Practice\\" missions, which act as side-quests. During missions, optional orders are issued which can be obeyed or ignored as the player chooses. Should they be accepted, the characters receive a temporary power boost, and completing the objectives yields rewards. Players can also engage in real-time strategy battles on the world map, with the player taking control of allied military divisions. Missions involve liberating cities and towns from enemy forces. Timed aerial missions are also available where the characters shoot down attacking dragons using their airship's weapons. While outside combat, players can breed chocobos, recurring galliform birds in the Final Fantasy series. Players must capture two chocobos on the world map and take them to a special ranch within the Peristylium: by pairing certain chocobos and adding specific items, a special chocobo can be bred for use. Players can visit the Peristylium Crystarium to review defeated enemies, character information, in-game lore and special video clips. Moogles, another recurring creature in the series, hand out missions to the player: the objectives of missions can change during gameplay. Items and new equipment can be bought from shops managed by non-player characters (NPCs) both within the Peristylium and across Orience. Towns liberated during missions give access to a wider range of shops. After completing the game once, players unlock a \\"New Game+\\" option: in this mode, players keep their stats and weapons from the previous playthrough, while also unlocking story scenes and character-specific missions. Type-0 features three difficulty levels; \\"normal\\", \\"hard\\", and \\"impossible\\". =Battle system= Screenshot of combat in Final Fantasy Type-0, showing characters Ace, Machina and Rem in combat with one of the game's common enemies. Type-0 uses a real-time, action-based battle system similar to the system used in Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. The player is allowed access to three characters, which they can swap between at any time. The two not being controlled are managed by the game's artificial intelligence. Each character has a specific weapon, and special attacks unique to a character are unlocked as they gain experience levels. During combat, characters lock onto targets while attacking and can switch targets. Characters are able to perform precisely timed attacks during the period when an enemy unit is attacking: the \\"Break Sight\\", which deals high damage, and the \\"Kill Sight\\", which kills a standard enemy with a single hit. Three characters can also be commanded to use a combining their attacks to deal higher damage to a target. Aside from human enemies, the game features multiple recurring Final Fantasy monsters. In addition to enemies encountered in missions, there are special enemies that can be encountered while exploring the world map. Defeated enemy units drop a substance called Phantoma. The color of Phantoma indicates what aspect of the character it will replenish, though in general they automatically replenish a set amount of magic points. Phantoma are used in the game's leveling system, the Altocrystarium, to strengthen a character's magic skills. The game's magic skills are divided into five basic groups named after types of guns: for example, \\"Rifle\\" fires the spell in a straight line, while \\"Missile\\" homes in on and chases targeted enemies. Holding down the assigned action button increases the power of the attack. Many combat situations involve timed challenges. Success rewards the character, while failure drains their health. If a character is defeated in battle, the player can instantly select another to replace it, and the defeated character must be revived outside the mission. The game features an arena where practice fights take place. While these fights are not against real foes, the characters continue to level up and gain Phantoma after the battle, and twenty battles can be arranged at any one time. Each character has access to summoned monsters called which act as temporary playable characters and have their own set of skills. Summoning them empties the selected character's health gauge, removing them from battle until they are revived. Summons are also affected by the current environment: as an example, Shiva's powers are stronger in snowy weather. After a limited time in battle, the Eidolons are dismissed. Those available to players are series staples Shiva, Ifrit, Golem, Odin, Diablos and Bahamut. Each Eidolon has variants of its original form, many of which are unlocked as the game progresses. Characters can continue to level up through activities within the Peristylium while the PSP is in sleep mode, the game's UMD is running, and the PSP is charging. The multiplayer function, activated through the game's configuration screen, allows two other players to jump into another host player's game via an online connection. The allotted time for multiplayer is limited to a few minutes, with transitions between zones triggering the end of a multiplayer section. The time limit can be extended by players helping their current host. The first and last segments of the game are not open to multiplayer. There is also a function called Magical Academy Assist, in which NPCs named after members of the game's production team are summoned into battle to assist the cadets. Synopsis Note: The plot of Type-0 is the same in its original version and the high-definition remaster Final Fantasy Type-0 HD, so the terms and quotes used in the text are from the localization of the high-definition remaster rather than unofficial translations. =Setting= Final Fantasy Type-0 is set within Orience, a land divided between four nations or \\"Crystal States\\". Each nation has crystals of power based on the Four Symbols, which are in turn their national emblems. The Dominion of Rubrum uses the Vermillion Bird Crystal, which controls magic; the Milites Empire controls the White Tiger Crystal, containing the power of science and weapons; the Kingdom of Concordia uses the Azure Dragon Crystal, containing the power of Dragons; and the Lorican Alliance is home to the Black Tortoise Crystal, containing the power of shielding. Each nation has an academy, or Peristylium, to research and protect the country's respective crystal. The crystals have the ability to mark humans as their countries' servants. These servants, called l'Cie, are branded with a symbol and are given a \\"Focus\\", a task to complete. While blessed with long life and the ability to transform into crystal, l'Cie are cursed to lose their memories over time. The people of Orience also lose their memories of the dead so they will not be held back by any past regrets and continue strengthening their souls through conflict, a mechanism put in place by the crystals for the convenience of the deities who crafted them. The main aim of many characters is to become Agito, a legendary figure who will appear and save the world from Tempus Finis, an apocalyptic event that will destroy Orience. =Characters= The main characters of Final Fantasy Type-0 are Class Zero, an elite group of 14 students from the Vermillion Peristylium. The first 12 are card wielder Ace, flute wielder Deuce, the archer Trey, magic-gun wielder Cater, the mace-wielding Cinque, scythe wielder Sice, whip wielder Seven, martial artist Eight, spearman Nine, katana wielding Jack, swordswoman Queen and dual pistol wielding King. The last two, Machina Kunagiri and Rem Tokimiya, double as narrators and the focus for the game's main subplot. Supporting Class Zero are their mentor Kurasame Susaya, and Arecia Al-Rashia, Class Zero's former mentor and the overseer for magical development at the Vermillion Peristylium. Other important characters from Rubrum are Khalia Chival VI, the current leader of Rubrum and headmaster of the Vermillion Peristyrium, and the l'Cie Caetuna. Multiple Militesi figures, led by Marshal Cid Aulstyne, act as the game's main antagonists. Other important characters include the Concordian queen Andoria, Gala, leader of the Rursus Army and the instigator of Tempus Finis, and Joker and Tiz, two mysterious figures who observe the events of the game. =Plot= Marshal Cid Aulstyne leads the army of Milites against the other nations of Orience, launching a devastating attack against the Vermillion Peristylium and neutralising the Vermillion Bird Crystal using a crystal jammer. Class Zero, immune to the effects of the jammer, repel the invasion. During the conflict Izana Kunagiri, Machina's older brother, is killed while on a mission for Class Zero. This event later creates a rift between Machina and Class Zero. Coordinated by Kurasame and Arecia Al-Rashia, Class Zero plays a key role in freeing Rubrum's territories and launching counterattacks in alliance with Concordia, while Lorica's capital is destroyed by a Militesi bomb. Andoria, Concordia's queen, then forces a ceasefire between the remaining nations. During peace talks in the Militesi capital, Class Zero is framed for Andoria's murder, resulting in Concordia's puppet government and Milites launching a united assault on Rubrum. During their flight, Machina storms off after clashing with Class Zero, and becomes a White Tiger l'Cie to protect Rem from his brother's fate before returning to them. The White Tiger Crystal's will eventually forces him to leave. With help from its l'Cie soldiers and Class Zero, Rubrum destroys the forces of Concordia and Milites, uniting Orience under its flag. This triggers the arrival of Tempus Finis, with the Rursus Army emerging from the magical fortress Pandaemonium to wipe out Orience's population. Cid and Class Zero each travel to Pandaemonium: Cid attempts to become Agito and is transformed into the Rursus Arbiter by Gala, while Class Zero resolve to halt Tempus Finis. As Class Zero face the Arbiter's trials, the Vermillion Bird Crystal offers them the chance to become l'Cie. During the original playthrough, if Class Zero accepts the offer, they go into battle against the Rursus and die, dooming Orience to be destroyed in Tempus Finis. Class Zero refuse the Crystal's offer and Rem is made a l'Cie in their place. Machina and Rem end up fighting each other in Pandaemonium: Rem is mortally wounded, and she and Machina turn to crystal. Weakened by the trials, Class Zero are initially unable to defeat the Arbiter. Machina and Rem's spirits give them the strength they need to defeat the Arbiter and halt Tempus Finis. Fatally injured, Class Zero spend their final minutes imagining their possible post- war lives. They are found by Machina and Rem, who have returned to human form and, along with the rest of Orience, are allowed to remember the dead. In a post-credits sequence, it is said that the Crystal States fall into turmoil as the Crystals lose their powers. Machina and Rem unite Orience and rebuild the world, and Machina records Class Zero's history before dying with Rem at his side. A second playthrough reveals that Orience is trapped in a stable timeloop created by Arecia and Gala, the respective servants of the deities Pulse and Lindzei, as part of an experiment to find the gateway to the Unseen Realm. Competing with each other to open the gateway using a different method, both failed and reset the world for another attempt. By the events of Type-0, the experiment had been performed over six hundred million times. Cid, aware of the cycle, wanted to free Orience from the Crystals' control, and killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Gala from using him. In a sequence unlocked during the second playthrough, Joker and Tiz speak with Arecia after the Arbiter's defeat and show her the memories of Class Zero and the people of Orience to make her reconsider restarting the experiment. After speaking with Machina and Rem, Arecia decides to abandon the experiment and returns the two to human form. In an alternate ending, Arecia chooses to remove the crystals from Orience's history, creating a new timeline where the war never occurred and the world's population can live happily. Development Final Fantasy Type-0 was originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, envisioned as a game for mobile devices. It was conceived in 2005 as part of Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries of Final Fantasy games linked by a common mythos. Agito XIII was the final original Fabula Nova Crystallis game to be created. The decision to make it a mobile game was based on the popularity of Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII. Hajime Tabata, who contributed to the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos, was searching for a new project after finishing Before Crisis and became the game's director. Before Crisis producer Kosei Ito acted as producer before his move to Capcom prior to 2009. Beginning development in 2006, it was first announced at that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). It was said to offer on-the-go access to the Fabula Nova Crystallis universe, using gameplay functions exclusive to mobile phones of the time. The concept was to deliver a game for mobile platforms equivalent to a console game from the main Final Fantasy series, and to make it available in its entirety upon release rather than in episodic format. Developers had been planning a release on the next generation of mobile phones, as those available at the time could not offer all the capabilities they would need. While it was originally claimed to be a mobile exclusive, versions for both mobiles and the PlayStation Portable were being developed, with the latter to be revealed when the former was sufficiently advanced. The original staff members were Tabata, Yusuke Naora and Tetsuya Nomura. Nomura acted as a character designer and creative producer. Between 2006 and 2008, development wavered between inactivity and sluggishness since most of the team was devoted to Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. In 2008, it was said to be facing serious problems due to the scale of the project. An issue developers had grappled with was whether or not to make the command buttons used in the game visible on the mobile screen. Agito XIII was described as an online RPG using fully rendered 3D graphics similar to console games, as well as having gameplay elements from multiple genres such as MMORPGs, smaller-scale multiplayer-focused games, and standard role-playing games. Other unfinished concepts being developed were a day-night cycle, a calendar system linked to real-world time and dates, and a story influenced by player votes. In 2008, it was decided to make Type-0 a PSP exclusive, cancelling the mobile version of the game as the developers did not want to wait for mobile technology to reach a level which could handle their full vision for the game. Full development began that year by the same team who developed Crisis Core, but was again slowed as most of them were completing work on The 3rd Birthday. Because of these conflicting projects, Type-0 came close to being cancelled outright. Between 2009 and 2011, the title was changed to distance it from Final Fantasy XIII, since after the platform change the two games had little in common other than their shared mythos. One of the titles considered and rejected was Final Fantasy Live, referring to the game's multiplayer element. The new title, Final Fantasy Type-0, was intended to indicate the game's separation from the main series. It was also the beginning of an alternative numbering system parallel to the main series. The game made its first official public appearance under the new title at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo, along with a new trailer that was released to the public on January 27, 2011. =Scenario and design= Artwork representing the themes and atmosphere of Type-0. The artwork was created by the game's art director Yusuke Naora, who drew on personal experience and the game's themes of war and death. Type-0s scenario was conceived by Tabata and written by Hiroki Chiba and Sarah Okabe. While the game was still titled Agito XIII, Tabata described it as \\"a major title [...] formed from a variety of concepts\\" which included the collision of four fantasies (the game's view of Orience), a battle between magic and weapons, and the two sides of reality. The early story concept drew heavily from popular manga and anime, but little survived after the platform change. Tabata instead chose a new style similar to historical films and documentaries. The new story's concept started with the idea of a war story told by young people caught up in the event, with its story themes revolving around death and its impact on others. A major inspiration was the Japanese documentary series Centuries of Picture. The final story was darker than many other Final Fantasy games. Despite its title change, the game was kept within the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos. The approach taken with the mythos was to portray the roles of its deities from a historical standpoint, while telling a story focused on the human side of events. The cyclic nature of the game's universe was created to help incorporate aspects of the mythos. The roles and backgrounds for each character in the game were conceived and put into place after the setting and main story had been finalized. After the game's release, Tabata commented that when he was writing the story he would have liked to have been more thorough, and to have made the story easier for players to understand. The game's logo artwork was drawn by regular series artist Yoshitaka Amano. The kanji symbol used in the logo was drawn by Naora, who had designed the Shinra logo in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Naora specifically requested that he draw the logo due to this previous experience. To achieve the grittier atmosphere, Naora took a research trip to a Japanese military camp to learn what being a military cadet was like. The island of the Vermillion Perystilium was based on an offshore Japanese island he had visited prior to his involvement with the game, adding elements in-game such as an offshore ship wreck to symbolize his fear of the sea. He was also influenced by an incident where he saw a dead cat surrounded by other cats to portray the bond between members of Class Zero, and the game's themes, in promotional artwork. The gameplay was inspired by the multi-character system of Before Crisis, while the naming of magic styles after weapons of war made reference to first-person shooters. The combat was designed to be filled with tension and portray each playable character's personality on the battlefield. The Eidolons were originally not controlled in realtime, but during the development of Ifrit, Tabata did some testing with real-time commands. The results impressed him enough that he decided to overcome the technical difficulties involved and make the Eidolons controllable. Due to technical restrictions and the presence of the Academy Assist function, the game's artificial intelligence for playable characters needed to be limited to healing, survival and other minor actions. The game's multiplayer was deliberately designed around restricted segments. Its development was still ongoing during the summer of 2011, with a temporary stoppage of PlayStation Network that year negatively affecting its development. Because of the size of the project, debugging the game took far longer than anticipated. Between the release of the demo and the full game, adjustments were made to gameplay mechanics and the in-game camera. In a post- release interview, Tabata commented that he would have liked to expand the multiplayer functions to include an ad-hoc function and expanded cooperative gameplay, and create a more forgiving learning curve for players. =Music= The music for Type-0 was composed by Takeharu Ishimoto. He had previously composed the music for Before Crisis, Crisis Core and The World Ends with You. Ishimoto gave the music a dark and heavy feel, describing the themes as \\"war, life, and death\\". He used less rock elements than in his previous games to promote a feeling of immersion. One of his primary instruments was the guitar, which Ishimoto played himself during recording sessions. Although the title was for the PSP, the team did not want to hold back despite hardware limitations, recording a quantity of tracks unusual for a spin-off Final Fantasy title. Wherever possible, the recording was done live. The orchestral and choral elements were performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the Cantillation chamber choir, and the recording and mixing of these tracks was done at the Sydney Opera House. Recording for other tracks was done at Ishimoto's studio in Japan. After recording, Ishimoto combined the orchestral and choral elements, and rearranged the main leitmotifs to create more variety in the score. Arrangements for the orchestral tunes were done by Kentaro Sato, while arrangements for other tracks were done by Rieko Mikoshiba. The game's theme song, \\"Zero\\", was composed and performed by Japanese rock band Bump of Chicken. The band, which was a big fan of the Final Fantasy series, was contacted by Square Enix to compose and perform the song and agreed readily. It was brought in after the platform move onto the PSP, but while the game was still titled Agito XIII. While looking for inspiration, the band was able to see in-development screenshots of the game, samples of the script, and character illustrations. The band was mostly given a free hand while composing the song. Its one guideline was provided by Tabata, who suggested the theme song for Centuries of Picture, \\"Is Paris Burning?\\" by Takeshi Kako, as a source of inspiration. Multiple versions of \\"Zero\\" were composed for use in different areas of the game. At the request of band leader Motoo Fujiwara, Amano's logo artwork was used for the cover of the single's limited edition. Final Fantasy Type-0 Original Soundtrack was released on October 26, 2011. The soundtrack was released in a standard edition, as well as a limited edition that could be purchased both separately and with the collector's edition of the game. A promotional album featuring five tracks was sold by Square Enix at their booth at the Odaiba Expo 2011. The album stayed on the Oricon charts for seven weeks, reaching a high of #25. The soundtrack has received positive reviews in the west from dedicated music outlets Original Sound Version and Game-OST, with the sites giving both individual tracks and the work in general high praise. \\"Zero\\" was released on October 19, 2011. It was released as a single instead of being part of the main soundtrack, receiving both a limited and standard edition. The single remained in the Oricon charts for thirty-two weeks, peaking at #2. Track listings Release Type-0 was released on October 27, 2011, receiving both physical and digital releases. It was initially announced for release in summer of that year, but unspecified difficulties with development including the stoppage of PlayStation Network caused a delay. It was then announced for released on October 13, but was delayed by two weeks. While Square Enix stated it wanted to improve its quality, no other information was given. It was speculated to be due to complaints surrounding the camera control and other gameplay elements. The releases of the soundtrack and the theme song were also delayed. Type-0 was one of a few releases for the PSP to be released on two UMDs, as Tabata wanted to cut as little content as possible, which would have been impossible if they had settled for using one UMD. A demo for the original game was released in August 2011, featuring seven playable characters and four missions at locked difficulty levels. Save data could be transferred to the full game, unlocking special costumes and items and keeping experience points. A second demo was released on November 22, a month after the full game's release. It replaced the original demo and gave players access to exclusive items and costumes. A collector's edition was released exclusively through Square Enix's online store, containing artwork, a limited edition version of the soundtrack, postcards and a booklet of character introductions. The title was later added to their Ultimate Hits budget title collection. Type-0 has never received an official localization in its original form. During development, while it was still titled Agito XIII, Tabata said he was trying to make the game appealing to North American players. Despite a localization being confirmed as in development in an official guidebook interview, the original version of Type-0 was not released in the west. In the wake of the game's release in Japan, 1UP.com and Joystiq speculated that the game could be successfully brought west as a port to the PlayStation Vita. Tabata later commented that the main reasons for the game not being localized were the flagging Western PSP market and uncertainties surrounding the Vita's commercial success. An unofficial fan translation patch was announced in mid-2012. Work on the fan translation took place over the following two years, during which time Square Enix was noncommittal concerning an official Western release. The patch was initially announced for an August 2014 release, but was instead was released on June 9, 2014. According to the translation team leader, the patch was downloaded 100,000 times in the first four days. It was taken down in July of the same year after Square Enix allegedly threatened unspecified legal action, originally thought to be a cease-and-desist order. Later statements revealed that the patch was released earlier than originally announced due to the lead translator on the project wanting fans to see their achievements, which ended up causing a rift between him and the rest of the team. Before the release, Square Enix and the translation team had been in friendly communication concerning the translation. The formal requests to take the patch down were made in the weeks following its release, shortly before the announcement of Type-0 HD. Work on the patch was eventually resumed and a second version, which included unofficial compatibility with the PlayStation 3 system and further translation bugfixes, was eventually released in 2015. =Merchandise= Multiple pieces of merchandise were created for the game. An Ultimania, part of a series of dedicated guidebooks, was released in the same month as the original game. It contained story and character breakdowns, concept art, and interviews with developers. A different book, was also released in October. It featured character biographies, details on the world of Orience, and interviews with the voice actors for Class Zero. The following year, a dedicated art book was released containing artwork of the game's characters and monsters, and an interview with Tabata. Characters from the game, including Ace, Machina and other members of Class Zero, appeared in the fourth series of releases for the Final Fantasy Trading Card Game. In November 2011, a manga adaptation of Type-0, illustrated by Takatoshi Shiozawa, began serialization in Young Gangan magazine. The manga has been collected into a tank≈çbon volume and was released on April 21, 2012. Another manga titled also illustrated by Shiozawa, began publication in Young Gangan in April 2012. It ended in January 2014, with a bonus chapter being published in February of that year, and was later released in five compiled volumes. Yen Press began distribution of the manga in the west in July 2015. Square Enix released two novel adaptations, in April and June 2012, depicting an alternate version of Type-0s story: and The novels were written by S≈çki Tsukishima. Reception In the first week on sale, Final Fantasy Type-0 sold 472,253 units, topping Japanese sales charts and selling through 79.08% of its initial shipments. As of January 16, 2012, the game had sold 746,203 copies in Japan. It was the best-selling game of 2011 for Japanese media retail shop Tsutaya, beating Monster Hunter Portable 3rd (PlayStation Portable) and Final Fantasy XIII-2 (PlayStation 3). It was also the store's best-selling PSP title of the year, followed by Monster Hunter Portable 3rd and Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy. Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation both praised the story, with Famitsu saying it \\"vividly portrays the fact that this is a deep, intense Final Fantasy experience, something beyond just a side story\\". Gaming website PlayStation LifeStyle's Heath Hindman was impressed by the darker presentation, calling it \\"powerful and well done throughout\\", and was impressed with the characters despite some awkward introductory scenes. Erren Van Duine, writing for RPG Site, said that fans would appreciate the scale of the narrative, and praised the handling of the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos. She did note that some plot points seemed only included for the sake of convenience, and that the ending forced a second playthrough to see the whole story. Famitsu called the original version's gameplay a \\"stressless experience\\", praising the game's size and saying the action-oriented battle system made it \\"a very different Final Fantasy\\". Dengeki PlayStation similarly praised its size and the tense combat, though the review found aspects of the navigation less appealing. Hindman was generally positive about most aspects of gameplay and the high replay value, but found faults with the scripted opening of the overworld and the real-time strategy segments. Van Duine said the gameplay encouraged immersion and was harsh on novices; she praised several aspects of gameplay, but described the leveling system as \\"tricky\\". The multiplayer functions were universally praised in Japan. Opinions were divided on the original camera, with Famitsu praising its movement, while Van Duine and Dengeki PlayStation found issues with it getting stuck in the environment or impeding visibility. The character AI also received criticism for being unresponsive or wayward. Legacy Type-0 affected several other works in multiple ways. During its development, several staff members and voice actors who had worked on Final Fantasy X reunited. Their meeting triggered the development of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. In the September 2013 issue of Famitsu Weekly, Square Enix revealed Final Fantasy Agito, an online companion game to Type-0 for iOS and Android mobile devices. The game was released in May 2014, and a localization was announced alongside that of Type-0. Its servers were closed down in November 2015, with its localization being cancelled as a result. A new online game set in the Type-0 universe, Final Fantasy Awakening, released in Asian and English-speaking territories between 2016 and 2018. While working on Final Fantasy XV, Tabata decided to make a high-definition remaster of Type-0 for eighth-generation consoles. Developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, Final Fantasy Type-0 HD was originally announced at E3 2014, and released worldwide in March 2015. After Type-0s release, Tabata stated in an interview that he wished to explore the distant history of Orience after the events of the game. Trademarks for Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 were registered shortly after the Type-0 trademark, but it was suggested that they were simply a protective measure. During interviews given in 2014, Tabata commented that he wished to work on Type-1 after completing XV, and later explained the conceptual Type series as a means of publishing Final Fantasy games too experimental for the main series. He hoped to continue with the Type series if Type-0 HD was commercially successful.

(It is worth noting, however, that Magneto killed him because he had acted without Magneto's approval, not because of Senyaka's sadistic nature. Magneto explained that, had he been present, he would have given Senyaka his blessing, but as he was not, he punished the Acolyte for acting without his orders.)Uncanny X-Men #304 Senyaka survived, however, by siphoning the life energy from agents from the international law enforcement agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D. who had recovered Senyaka's body.

The band's two core members, brothers Fran√ßois and Pierre Lamoureux, were born in Sudbury, and later lived in Toronto, Ottawa and Penetanguishene before moving to Montreal to study music at McGill University. They subsequently released their first album in 1993, and released four more albums before ending the band in 1999. They were renowned for creating and organizing a comprehensive network of venues baSed around schools across Canada. One of such networks eventually became R√©seau Ontario. Brasse-Camarade played over 500 concerts all over North-America from Alabama and Louisiana all the way to Yellowknife and from Vancouver to Baie St-Marie in Nova Scotia not to mention 35 tours in Portugal and the A√ßores and a few shows in France including The Olympia in Paris. The band had a few top ten hits but due to their Franco- Ontarian roots, were systematically blocked by certain radio-stations in Qu√©bec and some program directors were actually very vocal about it. After meeting with one such program director who re-iterated that he would never play them on his station (one of the biggest in Canada) because they were from Ontario, they decided to go where they were gaining momentum and that was Portugal. In the end, this led to Pierre and Fran√ßois attracting attention and eventually paved the way for a move to New York City and the creation of FogoLabs Corp. The irony is that they had tens of thousands of fans from the non stop touring (they would fill out theatres) but had no way of leveraging that with Radio or Television and that they stopped the band right at the dawn of the internet. In the case of Brasse-Camarade, Social Media would have made a huge difference to turn the tide with Radio in Qu√©bec. The Lamoureux brothers created FogoLabs Corp and Cinemusica. Both production companies that specialize in concert films including releases for Rush, Branford Marsalis, The Who, Cowboy Junkies, Brian Setzer, Pat Metheny, Joe Satriani, Peter Frampton\\"Une transition r√©ussie de la sc√®ne √† la cam√©ra\\", Le Voyageur, September 10, 2008. and Willie Nelson. Their Zappa Plays Zappa concert film earned a Grammy for Best Instrumental Rock Performance. Pierre and Fran√ßois Lamoureux also won the JUNO AWARD for MUSIC DVD OF THE YEAR on two occasions, once with The Tragically Hip (That Night In Toronto) and once with Billy Talent (666). The Lamoureux brothers also directed and produced Harry Connick, Jr.'s \\"Only You - The Concert\\" and \\"In Concert On Broadway\\" concert films. Both films earned Emmy Awards for Outstanding Music Direction. In addition, films by Pierre and Fran√ßois have earned a multitude of industry awards including two Gemini Awards with Cowboy Junkies, DVD Association Awards, DVD Award and Surround Music Awards for their various concert films with Rush, Branford Marsalis, Willie Nelson, The Stray Cats and The Brian Setzer Orchestra. In 2010, the brothers created Cinemusica, a production company entirely dedicated to their creative projects in the creative and performing arts. FogoLabs has since evolved into a full audiovisual production company that go beyond concert films. FogoLabs recently produced broadcasts of the Frangrance Industry Fifi Awards, the NEA Jazz Masters Awards and other live events. FogoLabs Corp currently produces the Front and Center as well as the Speakeasy series on PBS with Pierre and Fran√ßois Directing and Fran√ßois handling mixing. Artists on the series range from Joe Satriani to Christina Perri to Alt-J to Lady Antebellum.

It was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2016, Microsoft Windows in 2018, and Stadia as a launch title in 2019. The game features an open world environment and action- based battle system, incorporating quick-switching weapons, elemental magic, and other features such as vehicle travel and camping. The base campaign was later expanded with downloadable content (DLC), adding further gameplay options such as additional playable characters and multiplayer. Final Fantasy XV takes place on the fictional world of Eos; aside from Insomnia, the capital of Lucis, all the world is dominated by the empire of Niflheim, who seek control of the magical Crystal protected by the Lucian royal family. On the eve of peace negotiations, Niflheim attacks the capital and steals the Crystal. Noctis Lucis Caelum, heir to the Lucian throne, goes on a quest to rescue the Crystal and defeat Niflheim. He later learns his full role as the \\"True King\\", destined to use the Crystal's powers to save Eos from eternal darkness. The game shares a thematic connection with Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries of games linked by a common mythos which includes Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Type-0. The game's development began in 2006 as a PlayStation 3 spin-off titled Final Fantasy Versus XIII. Tetsuya Nomura served as the original director and character designer. After a development period of six years, it was changed to the next mainline title in the series in 2012; Nomura was replaced as director by Hajime Tabata, and the game shifted to eighth generation platforms. Due to the changes, the story needed to be rewritten and some scenes and characters were repurposed or removed. The setting of Final Fantasy XV was \\"a fantasy based on reality\\", with locations and creatures based on elements from the real world. To supplement the game, Square Enix created a multimedia project called the \\"Final Fantasy XV Universe\\", which includes a few spin-off games, as well as an anime series and feature film. Gameplay and story-based DLC was released between 2017 and 2019. Upon release, Final Fantasy XV was well received by journalists. Widespread praise was given for its gameplay, visuals, and emotional weight, while reception towards its story and presentation was mixed. By October 2019, the game had sold over 8.9 million copies worldwide. Gameplay Final Fantasy XV is an open world action role-playing game where players take control of main protagonist Noctis Lucis Caelum during his journey across the world of Eos. While accompanied by his three companions Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto, Noctis is the only character directly controlled by the player: he can navigate through simple movement, jump over small obstacles, sprint for a limited time, and perform context-based actions such as taking cover behind objects. The kingdom of Lucis is a large connected landmass that can be explored on foot, by using the party's car \\"Regalia\\", or chocobos, recurring galliform birds in the Final Fantasy series. Both the Regalia and chosen Chocobos can be customised by the player, and Chocobos can join in battles if their connection to the characters is strong enough. While Chocobos are controlled manually, the Regalia can be either manually or automatically controlled. The party can also fast-travel to areas unlocked on the world map. The Regalia must be refueled periodically at petrol stations. In towns the party can visit, there are inns and hotels where they can stay, shops where items and equipment can be purchased with the in-game currency gil, and local tipsters, non-playable characters (NPCs) who provide information on quests, from main story missions to side quests. Side quests are also available from individual NPCs found in towns. During some story sequences, dialogue choices appear for Noctis, with the selected option altering the response from NPCs. The game also contains two difficulty modes, with players being able to switch between the two. =Battle system= The Active Cross Battle system in action, showing Noctis attacking a hostile soldier in one of the game's environments The game uses an action-based real- time battle system, called the Active Cross Battle system. Instead of using a menu interface, the player selects commands directly mapped to buttons on the controller, such as \\"Attack\\", \\"Defend\\", and \\"Item\\". Battles take place within the current environment rather than transitioning to a separate arena, and can range from open plains to enclosed building interiors. When approaching enemies, a threat meter appears on the top of the screen, growing in intensity the closer the party gets to the enemy. When the party gets close and attacks or is detected, the battle begins. Running away from enemies and out of the combat zone in normal battles ends combat. During battle, each character has health points (HP), and Noctis also has magic points (MP). HP is depleted whenever a character is attacked, while Noctis's MP recovers over time when not in combat or when not using associated abilities such as warping or special weapon skills. If a character's current HP reaches zero, they enter Danger Mode, during which the maximum HP cap steadily decreases; the character is defeated when all of their maximum HP is lost. Some enemies, such as Daemons, are able to lower the HP cap with their attacks. If Noctis is defeated, there is a brief period where a revival item must be used. Should the player fail to do so, the game ends. Noctis can perform four actions in battle: the standard attack; defending, which blocks and parries attacks; warping, which takes Noctis to a targeted area such as another enemy or an out-of-the-way warp point, and using items. There is a \\"Wait Mode\\" option available, where if all player input stops the battle pauses, and players are able to select new enemies to attack or actions to take within a time limit. An option available for both Noctis and Ignis in Wait Mode is Libra, an ability which displays an enemy's health, strengths and weaknesses. Noctis can find and equip a wide range of weapons, including single and double-handed swords, polearms, axes, shields, firearms, daggers and Royal Arms. The weapons manifest from thin air as Noctis fights, and can be manually shifted by the player. The type of weapon equipped determines the attack speed and the amount of damage on normal attacks. In addition to normal attacks, there are attacks that deal more damage based on Noctis' position such as \\"Side Strike\\" or \\"Blindside\\", in addition to the Warp Strike attack. Attacks from enemies can be parried, and depending on the quality of the parry Noctis can counterattack. If wielding a shield-type weapon, a successful block staggers an enemy, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Noctis can launch a special attack with the Royal Arms dubbed \\"Armiger\\", when the meter fills during combat: while more powerful than standard weapons, Royal Arms consume HP with each use. Noctis can also use two classes of firearms‚ÄîGuns, which range from handguns like pistols to rifles; and Machinery, powerful weapons that have varying effects depending on the type used, from generating a powerful shockwave to dealing high melee damage. Noctis's companions, controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI), can perform contextual commands. When Noctis successfully parries an enemy attack, or performs a Side Strike or Blindside, cooperative attacks between him and his companions called Link- strikes can be triggered. During battle, a meter called the Tech Bar fills. When full, Noctis can command his companions to perform special moves called Techniques: Gladiolus performs a sweeping attack with his sword, Ignis uses his daggers to mark enemies so Noctis can perform a warp strike attack, and Prompto uses his firearm to fire a powerful shot that pierces through tough opponents. After each of these, Noctis can initiate a follow-up attack. Noctis can also trigger an Armiger Chain, where he splits his Royal Arms between his companions before launching a single attack. Magic is separated into two types: Elemancy and Arcana. Elemancy is separated into three types: Fire, Ice and Lightning. Elemental energy is drawn from points across the world map, being absorbed into special flasks and used to craft magical bombs that can be used on enemies. Elemancy can also be combined with specific items to add new effects, such as healing party members while damaging enemies. Both Noctis and his companions are able to use Elemancy. Arcana, accessed when Noctis has acquired and equipped a story-related item called the Ring of the Lucii, has access to more powerful magical abilities such as \\"Death\\", which drains an enemy's health. After a certain point in the game, Noctis can call upon summoned monsters called Astrals, which aid the party by launching a devastating attack. The summons featured are series regulars including Titan, Ramuh, Leviathan and Shiva. Their types of attack, and even whether they assist at all, is dependent on the environment: for instance, Leviathan can only be summoned in the open when there is a body of water nearby. At certain points in the story, Noctis is joined by guest characters who have their own Link-strikes and Techniques. =Character progression= After each battle, characters earn experience points (EXP), but they do not automatically level up when a certain amount of EXP has been gathered. Instead, the party must go to safe zones called \\"Havens\\", namely rest sites like inns or campsites. When the party rests at night, each character gains levels depending on the amount of EXP earned. If defeated in battle, all EXP gained up to that point since the last level up is permanently lost. Activities in the overworld earn the party Ability Points (AP). AP is spent on the Ascension Grid, the game's leveling system, which is divided into skill trees called \\"Astralspheres\\". Each Astralsphere is sorted by type, being associated with magic, combat or passive abilities. Spending AP opens up nodes within the Astralsphere, which in turn grants access to further nodes which require higher amounts of AP to unlock. Noctis' companions each have their own skills which themselves level up based on usage, and affect equipment. Noctis' fishing ability improves the more times he fishes and the better items he uses, which in turn spreads to his equipment. Gladiolus' Survival skills increase based on the distance the party has travelled in a day, which improves the quality of their equipment and items. Ignis' cooking can be improved based on ingredients either purchased at shops or found in the wild, and his meals grant stat boosts to the party. Prompto takes photos during the party's journey, and the quality of his own skills increase over time. A post-release update enables control of all four characters during battle after unlocking a dedicated node in the Ascension Grid; each character uses specific weapon types and abilities tied to them. =Multiplayer= A multiplayer mode called Comrades was released as an expansion, with gameplay and combat lifted from the main game and tailored for multiplayer; rather than a pre-set character, players take the role of a customizable avatar who takes part in a portion of the story skipped over by the main narrative. The game begins with players choosing their gender, hairstyle, clothing and other aspects. Using the in-game city of Lestallum as their base, the player is assigned missions with three other characters‚Äîeither other players or AI-controlled. During missions, the player fights monsters either on sorties or to defend transports; at the end of each mission, the player is awarded Gil, materials used for crafting and enhancing weapons, and \\"Meteorshards\\" which can power up settlements around Lestallum and open up new quests. Some areas unlock Royal Tombs which grant the player a Royal Sigil; these Sigils both increase specific statistics and grant new themed abilities such as healing or increasing combat moves. The player has access to a variety of weapon types from normal swords to maces and shurikens, which are enhanced using materials to increase passive abilities such as their damage capacity. The multiplayer mode will be shut down in June 2020, though the Comrades campaign can still be played with NPC party members. Synopsis =Setting= Final Fantasy XV takes place on the Earth-like world of Eos, which is divided between four nations: Lucis, Accordo, Tenebrae and Niflheim. Lucis, occupying a whole landmass, possesses a magical artifact known as the Crystal, gifted to the reigning Caelum dynasty by the world's deities in antiquity and accessed through the hereditary Ring of the Lucii. Accordo, located in the southern part of Eos, is an island nation formed through a union of free trading cities. The western continent is home to the technologically-advanced empire of Niflheim and the nation of Tenebrae, which is ruled by the Oracle‚Äîa priestess who can commune with the gods. The Oracle's main task is curing the Starscourge, a plague that absorbs all natural light and turns those infected into nocturnal monsters known as Daemons. Central to the lore of Eos are the Astrals, six divine beings who serve as the guardians of the natural world and are based on summoned monsters from the Final Fantasy series; and the True King, a legendary figure prophesied to appear when the Starscourge threatens to plunge Eos into eternal night. A key part of Eos's backstory is the Great War of Old, a conflict born when the ancient human civilization of Solheim turned on the Astrals and their patron Ifrit; Ifrit's attempt to destroy humanity defied the Astrals' duty to protect Eos, forcing them to kill Ifrit. The Great War of Old is implied to have caused the spread of the Starscourge across the planet, hastening the fall of Solheim. For centuries, Lucis has been at war with the militaristic Niflheim, who seek to emulate Solheim's glory. To that end Niflheim has subjugated most of Eos, including Accordo and Tenebrae; Tenebrae retains limited political autonomy due to the Oracle's influence. Only Lucis's capital city of Insomnia remains unconquered due to the use of the Crystal's power, which is slowly draining the current king's life force. At the game's beginning an armistice is declared between the two nations due to the king's failing health; as part of the peace agreements, Niflheim will gain control of all Lucian territories outside Insomnia, and a marriage is arranged between the heirs apparent of the royal families of Lucis and Tenebrae. =Characters= Promotional artwork featuring the core and supporting cast of Final Fantasy XV and its expanded media. The game's protagonist is Noctis Lucis Caelum, the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Lucis, who loses his father in the Niflheim invasion. Noctis is accompanied on his journey throughout the world of Eos by three others: Gladiolus Amicitia, the scion of a family sworn to protect Noctis's family; Ignis Scientia, a prodigy military tactician and Noctis's advisor; and Prompto Argentum, a friend of Noctis from a lower social class. Guest characters include Cor Leonis, a legendary warrior of Lucis who acts as an early guide to Noctis's party; Iris Amicitia, the sister of Gladiolus; and Aranea Highwind, a mercenary dragoon in service to Niflheim. Other key characters are Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, the current Oracle and former Princess of Tenebrae who is betrothed to Noctis; Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII, king of Lucis and the father of Noctis; and Gentiana, Lunafreya's attendant. The empire of Niflheim is ruled by Emperor Iedolas Aldercapt. Aldercapt's notable subordinates include Ardyn Izunia, the imperial chancellor and the game's main antagonist; Ravus Nox Fleuret, Lunafreya's brother and the high commander of Niflheim's army; and Verstael Besithia, the empire's head researcher. =Plot= Noctis and his three friends begin their journey to Altissia, the capital of Accordo, where Noctis's wedding to Lunafreya will take place. Finding the local boat services stopped, they receive news of Niflheim's attack on the city of Insomnia and theft of the Crystal; the King Regis has been assassinated, and both Noctis and Lunafreya are declared dead. Meeting up with Cor, Noctis is tasked with retrieving the Royal Arms‚Äîthe magical weapons of past Lucian kings‚Äîto rescue the Crystal and reclaim his throne. While staying in the city of Lestallum with Iris, Noctis is contacted by the Astral Titan; encouraged by Ardyn, Noctis endures Titan's trial and earns his power, learning that Lunafreya is traveling ahead of Noctis to awaken the Astrals from their slumber. The group continues to travel across Lucis, retrieving the Royal Arms and meeting the Astral Ramuh with assistance from Gentiana. He is also confronted by a hostile Ravus, spars with the mercenary Aranea, and receives further aid from Ardyn. The group eventually recover parts to repair Regis's old yacht, using it to travel to Altissia. The party arrives in Altissia, where Lunafreya has taken sanctuary. Lunafreya awakens the Astral Leviathan so Noctis can obtain her power, only for Leviathan to go on a rampage when Niflheim attacks. Ardyn appears and mortally wounds Lunafreya, disrupting the ritual; however, she succeeds in awakening Noctis's powers, allowing him to defeat Leviathan. While unconscious, he is visited in a dream by Lunafreya's spirit, who gives him the Ring of the Lucii. Noctis wakes to find Altissia in chaos, and that Ignis was blinded during the battle. The party continues towards Niflheim's capital of Gralea by train. Ignis' blindness and Noctis's mourning of Lunafreya cause friction with Gladiolus until Ignis forces a reconciliation. It is also revealed that the nights are growing longer, causing more Daemons to appear. Ardyn then tricks Noctis into throwing Prompto from the train, and holds Prompto and the Crystal captive in Gralea's military fortress Zegnautus Keep, revealing the Crystal's power can destroy the Daemons. Noctis continues to Tenebrae, where Aranea is aiding refugees from across Eos. While in Tenebrae, Noctis learns that Lunafreya was dying from waking the Astrals, and that Ravus now supports him. On the final journey to Gralea, the train is ambushed by Daemons; after defeating them, Noctis receives the Astral Shiva's blessing from Gentiana, revealed as Shiva's human form. Arriving to find Gralea overrun by Daemons, Noctis is separated from his friends and forced to use the Ring of the Lucii to survive Zegnautus Keep. After reuniting and rescuing Prompto, the party continues through Zegnautus Keep, defeating Ravus and Emperor Aldercapt, who have been transformed into Daemons. Forced to leave his friends behind, Noctis reaches the Crystal, only to be pulled into it. Ardyn appears and reveals himself to be Ardyn Lucis Caelum, a healer ostracised by his family with support from the Astrals and Crystal after being infected by the Starscourge. Ardyn sought revenge on the Caelum bloodline and the Crystal, spreading the Starscourge while waiting for the True King to appear so he could destroy them both. Within the Crystal, Noctis encounters the Astral Bahamut; he learns that he is the True King of prophecy, who will cleanse the Starscourge and restore light to Eos at the cost of his life. Noctis returns to Eos after ten years, finding the world engulfed in darkness. Reuniting with his friends, Noctis heads for Insomnia, fighting Ifrit‚Äîrevived and corrupted by the Starscourge‚Äîbefore facing Ardyn. After killing Ardyn in single combat, Noctis ascends the throne and sacrifices himself, using the Crystal and Ring of the Lucii to purge the Starscourge from Eos. In the afterlife, with help from Lunafreya, Noctis destroys Ardyn's spirit. In mid-credits and post- credits scenes, Noctis opens up to his companions before the final battle, and finds rest with Lunafreya in the afterlife. The journeys of Noctis' friends during their absence in the main story are expanded through downloadable content (DLC). In Episode Gladiolus, Gladiolus tests his strength against recurring Final Fantasy character Gilgamesh following their first confrontation with Ravus. Episode Prompto follows the titular character after Ardyn tricks Noctis into throwing him from the train to Tenebrae, and focuses on his origins as Verstael's cloned son, designed as one of Niflheim's Magitek soldiers. With help from Aranea, Prompto defeats Verstael‚Äîwho transfers his soul to the Magitek creation Immortalis to conquer Eos‚Äîbefore heading for Gralea. In Episode Ignis, Ignis allies with a disillusioned Ravus in the wake of Leviathan's rampage. After finding Lunafreya dead and Noctis unconscious, they are ambushed by Ardyn; Ignis uses the Ring of the Lucii to save Noctis, which costs him his sight. In an alternate route, he surrenders to Ardyn and gains knowledge that allows Noctis to save Eos without sacrifice. In the story mode for the multiplayer expansion Comrades, the player controls a survivor of the Kingsglaive, Regis's bodyguard who abandoned him during Niflheim's attack on Lucis. Despite the peoples' mistrust, the Kingsglaive help defend humanity's last stronghold of Lestallum while experiencing visions of Noctis's resting place on the island of Angelgard. Drawn to Angelgard, the Kingsglaive face Bahamut in combat and are absolved of their treachery, dedicating themselves to protecting Angelgard from Daemons during Noctis's slumber. In Episode Ardyn, Ardyn is revealed to have been imprisoned on Angelgard for two millennia by his brother Somnus after the Astrals denounce him for absorbing the Starscourge from victims. Ardyn's beloved Aera, Lunafreya's ancestor, was killed during the confrontation before Ardyn was sealed away. Rescued by Verstael to aid Niflheim's research over thirty years before Final Fantasy XV, Ardyn eventually agreed to join the empire while corrupting a revived Ifrit to aid in his revenge. Ardyn launches an assault on Insomnia, nearly killing Regis to force Somnus to appear in his Lucii form. Ardyn overpowers his brother before Bahamut intervenes and reveals Ardyn's destined role as the embodiment of the Starscourge and his prophesied death at the True King's hand. In the canon ending, Ardyn submits to his fate in exchange for his revenge against Noctis's family; in the alternate ending, Ardyn rebels and is tortured into submission by Bahamut. Upon his return to reality, Ardyn vows to kill the True King in defiance of the Astrals. Development Final Fantasy XV was primarily developed by Business Division 2 of Square Enix, creators and developers of the Final Fantasy franchise. Additional studios that helped with development included HexaDrive, XPEC Entertainment, Plusmile, and Streamline Studios. Staff included director Hajime Tabata; producer Shinji Hashimoto; main writer Saori Itamuro, who wrote the scenario based on the original draft by Kazushige Nojima; and art directors Tomohiro Hasegawa, Yusuke Naora and Isamu Kamikokuryo. Character designs were by Tetsuya Nomura and Roberto Ferrari, with later revisions by Naora. The main characters' clothing was designed by Hiromu Takahara, lead designer for Japanese fashion house Roen. The soundtrack for Final Fantasy XV was composed primarily by Yoko Shimomura, while both real-time and CGI cutscenes were directed by Takeshi Nozue of Visual Works, Square Enix's in-house CGI production studio. Logo illustration was by regular series artist Yoshitaka Amano. Development began in 2006 as a spin-off title for the PlayStation 3 called Final Fantasy Versus XIII. It was announced as part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries of games linked by a common mythos, and ran in Square Enix's proprietary Crystal Tools engine. Developed by the team behind the Kingdom Hearts series, it was intended to be a darker entry in the Final Fantasy series than allowed in the main series. Nomura was the original director, designer, and created the initial concept and scenario. The project suffered from a prolonged and troubled development, only making fragmentary appearances over the following six years. As early as 2007, the project's scale prompted talks of rebranding it as the next mainline entry. With the internal unveiling of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, it was decided to change it into a mainline entry, with a proposed PS3 version being scrapped due to technical troubles. The game's engine also changed, shifting to the company's new proprietary Luminous Engine. At the time of its rebranding and shift to next-generation consoles in 2012, Versus XIII was described as being on 20-25% complete, with Tabata saying it never took shape. When Tabata took over from Nomura, the entire development team was reshuffled and development started over again, although he worked as a co-director with Nomura until late 2013 to ensure the project remained as true as possible to its original vision. Among the changes were the removal of the original story's opening, and the replacement of the original heroine Stella Nox Fleuret with the similarly named Lunafreya. The connection to Fabula Nova Crystallis was also reduced, with branding and mythos-specific terminology removed to aid in the game's marketing. Thematic, aesthetic and design elements were retained due to their core place in the world and backstory. The main concept behind Final Fantasy XV was \\"a fantasy based on reality\\", with the world being very similar to Earth and having fantasy elements gradually intruding into an otherwise normal setting. In pursuit of this, locations in Eos were based on real-world locations such as Tokyo, Venice and the Bahamas. =Final Fantasy XV Universe= Due to the scale of the game's narrative and Tabata's wish to release a single game rather than a series of games similar to Final Fantasy XIII, aspects of the planned narrative were refashioned into supplementary media projects. Known as the \\"Final Fantasy XV Universe\\", the projects were split into two parts; media designed to reach a wider audience than the game might manage alone, and additional game-related content such as ports to other hardware and DLC. The project was first revealed at a March 2016 press event called \\"Uncovered: Final Fantasy XV\\". Tabata later stated that those who just played the game would miss context for story events shown in other related media. The two central parts of the \\"Final Fantasy XV Universe\\" are the feature film Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV and the original net animation Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV. Brotherhood was produced by anime studio A-1 Pictures under supervision from Square Enix; the narrative focused on the backstories of Noctis and his companions. The series was released online between March and September 2016. Kingsglaive, which received a limited theatrical release in 2016, was a collaboration between Visual Works and Western studios including Digic Pictures and Image Engine; the story, which mainly focused on original characters, recycled story elements cut from the opening narrative of Final Fantasy XV. Also forming part of the project were Platinum Demo: Final Fantasy XV, a game demo detailing an incident in Noctis's childhood which tied into the events of Brotherhood; Justice Monsters Five, a mobile game based on a minigame from Final Fantasy XV which was active from August 2016 to March 2017; A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV, a promotional beat 'em up featuring Regis as the playable character; Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV, a virtual reality simulation game released in 2017 for PlayStation VR; and Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire, a massively multiplayer online strategy game published by Machine Zone in 2017 and developed by their Epic Action subsidiary. =Release= Initially announced in 2006 alongside XIII and Type-0, the game was publicly rebranded at the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo, with regular updates on the title beginning the following year. A demo titled Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae was released in March 2015 as a limited addition to Final Fantasy Type-0 HD. The game's localization was handled by Dan Inoue, who used different accents for characters to denote their origins on different parts of Eos. In addition to English, Japanese and European languages, the game was localized for Latin America with Latin American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese text: this was the first time a Final Fantasy title was localized into these languages. Its initial worldwide release, September 30, was announced at the \\"Uncovered\\" event. Despite this intended date, further polishing work resulted in the date being pushed back to November 29. Further fixes were applied to the game through a Day One patch released concurrent with the game. The game was published in multiple editions, called \\"Day One\\", \\"Deluxe\\", and \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\". The \\"Deluxe\\" edition included a Blu-ray edition of Kingsglaive, while the \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" included both Kingsglaive and a version of Brotherhood with additional footage related to Luna. In 2018, a version of the game called Royal Edition was released, which contained both all DLC published to that point in addition to further story and gameplay additions alongside technical improvements. A version for Microsoft Windows was released on March 6, 2018. Square Enix developed the port with Nvidia using an upgraded version of the Luminous Studio engine, featuring graphical enhancements and all DLC. These improvements and additions were also released as part of the console- exclusive Royal Edition. The game was also ported to the streaming-based Stadia platform, releasing on November 19, 2019 as a launch title. Another version, titled Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition, was released in February 2018 for iOS and Android. The game was co-developed by Square Enix, SummerTimeStudio, and XPEC Entertainment. Development began in 2015 following the release of Episode Duscae; the game was produced by Kosei Ito, who was producer on Tabata's first major Square Enix title Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII. Downloadable content Multiple pieces of downloadable content (DLC) were created for the game by a smaller development team from the core Final Fantasy XV staff. The team was supervised by Tabata and headed by new producer Haruyoshi Sawatari. Both free and paid DLC were announced, with paid DLC being a necessity due to overall production costs. Among the DLC were additional story elements intended to address player criticisms of the game's narrative structure and missing details. The main DLC episodes focusing on filling in narrative gaps related to Noctis's friends‚ÄîEpisode Gladiolus, Episode Prompto and Episode Ignis‚Äîwere released respectively in March, June and December 2017. A story-driven multiplayer mode called Comrades was released in November 2017, with Final Fantasy XV becoming the first mainline single-player Final Fantasy to include multiplayer content. A standalone version of Comrades was released for PS4 and Xbox One in December 2018 to replace the DLC version of Comrades. Other DLC included temporary events such as the \\"Moogle Chocobo Carnival\\" event and a collaboration with Assassin's Creed Origins. Episode Ignis was intended to be the last story-based DLC, but positive player feedback resulted in Square Enix wanting to develop further content focusing on other main characters, such as Ardyn. Episode Ardyn was released in March 2019, and was the final post-release update for Final Fantasy XV. Originally part of a tetralogy of story-based DLC episodes dubbed The Dawn of the Future, the other episodes were cancelled due to structural changes within Square Enix. Announced features related to the PC port such as mod support were also cancelled. Story material for The Dawn of the Future DLC has been turned into a novel of the same name. Released in Japan in April 2019, a Western release is planned for June 2020. Reception Final Fantasy XV has received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics for all versions, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave both versions of the game a score of 38 points out of 40. Various game designers stated Final Fantasy XV was their favorite game of 2016, including Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, Atlus' Shigeo Komori, Koei Tecmo's Takashi Morinaka, and Sony Interactive Entertainment's Teruyuki Toriyama and Shuhei Yoshida. Opinions on the story of Final Fantasy XV were mixed, although the main cast was praised for its chemistry. Game Informers Andrew Reiner praised the change to a simple straightforward plot after the complex lore of Final Fantasy XIII. Peter Brown of GameSpot and Philip Kollar of Polygon praised the mundane activities and character interactions, with Kollar calling Noctis's companions the game's \\"beating heart\\", In contrast, Jonathan Leack of Game Revolution found the characters lacked interest during the early parts of the campaign, and Hardcore Gamers Adam Beck called the main story a \\"monumental disappointment\\" despite enjoying the lead cast. The minimal representation of supporting characters was also frequently faulted. David Roberts of GamesRadar, Electronic Gaming Monthlys Mollie L. Patterson and Destructoids Chris Carter also noted the crucial part played by the game's expanded media in grounding or fleshing out the main story. The visuals and realistic style were positively received, with IGNs Vince Ingenito enjoying the unusual use of realistic aesthetic details for the towns and environment. Roberts, Brown, Leack, Beck and Kollar praised the open world design and depth of detail, in addition to its scale and similarity to open worlds from recent Western games. Beck also noted the setpiece moments as beautiful in appearance despite weak narrative elements and confusing or convoluted gameplay. Leack positively noted the main cast's eye-catching design, which he felt helped maintain a connection during the early sections of the game. Shimomura's score was also positively received by critics. The gameplay was praised for its fast pace and engaging mechanics despite a lack of depth compared with other action games, with several reviewers comparing it to Kingdom Hearts; Patterson positively compared normal battles to the CGI cutscene-exclusive battles of earlier Square Enix titles, while Leack called the combat system \\"Kingdom Hearts meets Dissidia\\" and praised its depth and accessibility. Digital Spys Kirk McKeand praised the behaviour of Noctis's companions in battle, saying they were effective supporting units. The linear second half drew criticism, with Roberts predicting that it would be one of the game's most divisive elements. The summons were seen as spectacular, but either lacking meaning in gameplay or being too difficult to activate. Several reviewers noted the in- game camera's occasionally erratic behaviour. =Sales= Within the first twenty-four hours, Square Enix reported that Final Fantasy XV had shipped five million units worldwide in both physical shipments and digital sales‚Äîa figure which allowed the game to \\"break even\\" on development costs. This gave Final Fantasy XV the biggest launch in the franchise to date, the most first day digital sales in Japan for a game up to that point, and set records for physical shipments and downloads in mainland Asia. Commenting on the large numbers, Tabata revealed that the strong sales saved the Final Fantasy franchise as a whole, which had seen declining commercial success in recent years. According to Square Enix, shipments had reached over six million worldwide by January 2017. In May of the same year, Square announced the game and Rise of the Tomb Raider helped to increase sales and profits for the 2016-2017 fiscal year. In a later interview, Enterbrain president Hirokazu Hamamura stated that the game had sold seven million copies worldwide by January 2018, ranking it as a \\"huge success\\". By October 2019, that number had risen to over 8.9 million.4Gamer.net (2019/10/18) In Japan, the PS4 version topped Japanese gaming charts, selling 690,471 units. The Xbox One version sold nearly 3,800 units. Total sales of both versions came to 694,262 units, with the game's release boosting console sales for the PS4 over the previous week by over 42,000 units. Second week sales in the region were 79,792 units, down 88% from launch week and causing the game to drop to fifth place. Different rankings in January the following year placed the Japanese sales of Final Fantasy XV as between 900,000 and one million copies. In the United Kingdom's all-format gaming charts ending December 3, Final Fantasy XV was the second biggest launch for the series after Final Fantasy XIII. According to the December data released by the NPD Group, Final Fantasy XV was the second best-selling title of the month behind Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. The game also became the month's best-selling PS4 title, and saw the best console launch month in the franchise's history. =Awards= Final Fantasy XV won numerous awards from various gaming publications, including \\"Game of the Year\\" from RPG Site and RPGFan, and \\"Best RPG (People's Choice)\\" from IGN, PlayStation Blog awarded Final Fantasy XV awards in the categories of \\"Best PS4 Game\\", \\"Best Use of Pro\\", \\"Best Soundtrack\\", and \\"Best Visuals\\"; and in Game Informers 2017 RPG of the Year Awards awarded the game for \\"Best Post- Launch Support\\". At the 2017 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards the game won Game, Franchise Role Playing and Song, Original or Adapted. It was also nominated for \\"Best Original Soundtrack Album\\" and for \\"Best Original Instrumental\\" (\\"Valse di Fantastica\\") at the 15th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards.

The story of Tonpa Shenrab was revealed in a fourteenth century terma of Loden Nyingpo.Schaik, Sam van. Tibet: A History. Yale University Press 2011, page 99-100. Etymology The name Shenrab Miwo is in the Zhang-Zhung language, which is a relative of Old Tibetan; while many suggestions have been put forward as to its meaning, it appears to be the Zhangzhung word \\"bodhisattva\\" (equivalent to Tibetan sh√©gya sempa, ).  Shenrab's life according to Bon traditions  According to Bon doctrine, Tonpa Shenrab and lived 18,000 years ago, predating Gautama Buddha. Practitioners of Bon believe that he first studied the Bon doctrine in Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring, at the end of which he pledged to Shenlha Okar, the god of compassion, that he would guide the peoples of this world to liberation. Like Gautama, T√∂npa Shenrab was of royal birth. Tonpa Shenrab renounced his royal inheritance at the age of thirty-one to travel the path to enlightenment. Tonpa Shenrab embraced the life of a renunciate and commenced austerities, spreading the doctrine of Bon; at length, he arrived in the land of Zhangzhung near what is widely held to be Mount Kailash. Accounts of Tonpa Shenrab's life are to be found in three principal sources, the Dod√º (), Zermik (), and Ziji (). The first and second of the accounts are held to be terma discovered by tert√∂n in the 10th or 11th century; the third is part of the oral lineage () transmitted from teacher to disciple. Aspects of Shenrab Miwoche Shenrab Miwoche is said to have three aspects or forms: the tulku () or nirma·πáakƒÅya, Shenrab Miwoche; the dzokku () or sambhogakƒÅya, Shenlha Okar and the b√∂nku () or dharmakƒÅya, Tapihritsa.The Tibetan for dharmakaya is chos sku in the Buddhist context; though a case can be made that Bon borrowed some, or even much, of its current terminology from Buddhism, to suggest that Sanskrit words are thus the \\"source\\" of this terminology is dubious.

He was created by writer Dave Gibbons and artist Will Simpson. Subsequently Michael Fleisher and then Steve White took over as regular series writers. Friday was the lead character of the new Rogue Trooper series, which was a reboot of the original 1981 series, of which Gibbons had been the creator artist (with writer Gerry Finley-Day). Like the original Rogue Trooper, Friday is a Genetic Infantryman ‚Äì a clone soldier genetically- engineered to survive in a toxic environment in which normal people require chemical-warfare suits and gas masks ‚Äì fighting on the planet Nu-Earth. In 1995 the original Rogue Trooper briefly appeared alongside Friday in the new series. (See also 2000 AD crossovers#Rogue Trooper.) Publication history On the strength of Watchmen, the editorial staff of 2000 AD asked Dave Gibbons if he would be interested in redesigning the Rogue Trooper character. Gibbons accepted and proposed also writing it, which was greenlit by Richard Burton. However, time commitments would not allow him to both write it and provide the stories art and Will Simpson was brought in to cover the art duties.Bishop (2007) page 130-131 Gibbons says the redesign \\"was my chance to put everything into Rogue Trooper I wanted and take out all the crap, like the bio- chips\\"Bishop (2007) page 131 The fourteen-part story was hit by scheduling problems due to the lateness of the art. Gibbons said \\"I'm still quite happy with the story, although the way it was serialised was erratic - in for two issues, then out again. I was trying to have something that was quite cumulative.\\" Michael Fleisher took over the writing of the series with artists Ron Smith, Simon Coleby and Chris Weston. Editor Alan McKenzie has declared about the new writer: \\"on paper Fleisher was a good bet. ... But his work on 2000 AD was embarrassing. I did my best to save it, but you can't polish a turd.\\"Bishop (2007) page 141 After five stories Steve White was brought in to help address some problems. According to editor John Tomlinson \\"Ever since \\"War Machine\\" in 1989, readers had been confused as hell about who is Friday and whether he was the original Rogue. I told Steve to figure that out and explain it.\\"Bishop (2007) page 168 This led to a two-year-long run on the series for the writer, although there was a move to hand the series to Mark Millar which only resulted in a three-part story. During this period Friday met both Judge Dredd, in an issue-length story,Judge Dredd: \\"Casualties Of War\\" (by John Wagner and John Higgins, in 2000 AD #900, 1994) and later the original Rogue Trooper,\\"Blue on Blue\\" (by Steve White and Henry Flint, in 2000 AD #928-931, 1995) the latter being intended to settle the issue of their origins and connections. Unfortunately, according to Tomlinson \\"Steve came up with a fairly watertight explanation, but it was enormously complicated and probably confused far more people than it enlightened.\\"Bishop (2007) page 179 That story also brought in Venus Bluegenes, a G.I. Doll, who would appear in one more story\\"Hot Metal\\" (by Steve White and Steve Tappin, in 2000 AD #983-986, 1996) before her appearance in the final story to feature Friday. Dan Abnett, co-author for that story, was complimentary of White's work, \\"Steve had such a great feel for military goings on,\\" however, this couldn't overcome intrinsic problems with the story as \\"he was absolutely hamstrung by the weight of continuity.\\"Bishop (2007) page 188-189 In the final story in 1996, Friday and Venus disappeared into a black hole and have not reappeared since. Subsequent Rogue Trooper stories have all featured the original version of the character. Characters Friday's adventures are a retcon of the Rogue Trooper storyline. Since all the G.I.s were identical and had serial numbers instead of names, they gave each other descriptive nicknames to tell each other apart. *Friday (G.I. #19) is equivalent to Rogue. He seems to be less dogmatic and is stronger-willed than the other G.I.s. *Top (G.I. #01), the G.I. company sergeant and field-radioman, is equivalent to Helm. He has an upgraded version of the standard issue G.I. helmet with improved sensors, increased communications range and multiple channels. *Eightball (G.I. #08), the unit sniper, is equivalent to Gunnar. He has a rifle with enhanced sensors and a more powerful electronic sight. *Lucky (G.I. #13), the unit Equipment Man, is equivalent to Bagman. He has a Backpack with extra equipment, including Caustic Foam Dispensers and over-the-shoulder lighting mechanism.

Stolen Cello On April 27, 2004, the General Kyd, a $3.5 million Stradivarius on loan to him from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, was stolen after he left it on his porch. It was discovered in a dumpster by Melanie Stevens, a 30-year-old nurse, after a home surveillance video from across the street showed the cello being lifted by a clumsy thief on a bicycle at around 6:30 am. Stevens initially asked her boyfriend to turn it into a CD cabinet, though a week and a half later she caught a news report about the missing cello and the $50,000 reward for its return. She identified it on the police website and sought to return it, with the aid of a lawyer.

Named after Sir Robert Montgomery, it lay in the Bari Doab, or the tract between the Sutlej and the Ravi rivers, extending also across the Ravi into the Rechna Doab, which lies between the Ravi and the Chenab. The administrative headquarters was the town of Montgomery, present-day Sahiwal. In 1978, the name of Montgomery District was changed to Sahiwal District. Administration The district was administratively subdivided into 4 tehsils, these were:Montgomery District - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 17, p. 412. *Montgomery *Gogera *Depalpur *Pakpattan Boundaries The district had an area of and included the present-day districts of Sahiwal, Pakpattan, Okara, and portions of Shekhupura, Faisalabad, Toba Tek Singh, and Vehari. It was bounded by the Districts of Lahore on the north-east, Jhang on the north-west, and Multan on the south-west, while on the south-east it bordered the Native State of Bahawalpur and the British District of Firozpur. Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 17, p. 409. In the former tract a fringe of cultivated lowland skirted the bank of either river, but the whole interior upland consisted of a desert plateau partially overgrown with brushwood and coarse grass, and impenetrable jungle in places. On the farther side of the Ravi, again, the country at once assumed the same desert aspect.  History  The population according to the 1901 census of India was 463,586, a decrease of 0.4% in the decade due to emigration to the Chenab Colony. The principal crops in the early 20th century were wheat, pulse, cotton and fodder; camels were bred for export. The leading industries were cotton, silk and lacquered woodwork, and there were factories for ginning and pressing cotton. The district was traversed by the main line of the North-Western Railway, from Lahore to Multan; it is irrigated by the Upper Sutlej inundation canal system and also from the Ravi. The Rechna Doab was long home to the pastoral Jats, who had constantly maintained a sturdy independence against the successive rulers of northern India. The sites of Kamalia and Harappa contain large mounds of antique bricks and other ruins left by the Indus Valley Civilisation, while many other remains of ancient cities or villages lie scattered along the river bank, or dotted the then- barren stretches of the central waste. In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of northern Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh Empire invaded and occupied Sahiwal. The pastoral tribes of this barren expanse did not appear to have paid more than a nominal allegiance to the Muslim rulers, and even in the 19th century, when Ranjit Singh extended the Sikh supremacy as far as Multan, the population for the most part remained in a chronic state of rebellion. In 1847 British influence was first exercised in the district when an officer was deputed to effect a summary settlement of the land revenue. Direct British rule was commenced on the annexation of the Punjab in 1849. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, there was a general rising of the Jat clans, the District formed the scene of the only rising which took place north of the Sutlej. Before the end of May, emissaries from Delhi crossed the river from Sirsa and Hissar, where open rebellion was already rife, and met with a ready reception from the Kharrals and other fierce Jat clans. The District authorities, however, kept down the threatened rising till August 26, when the prisoners in jail made a desperate attempt to break loose. At the same time Ahmad Khan, a famous Kharral leader, who had been detained at Gogera, broke his arrest, and, though apprehended, was released on security, together with several other suspected chieftains. On September 16 they fled to their homes, and the whole country rose in open rebellion. Kamalia was sacked; and Major Chamberlain, moving up with a small force from Multan, was besieged for some days at Chichawatni on the Ravi. The situation at the civil station remained critical till Colonel Paton arrived with substantial reinforcements from Lahore. An attack which took place immediately after their arrival was repulsed. Several minor actions followed in the open field, until finally the rebels, driven from the plain into the wildest jungles of the interior, were utterly defeated and dispersed. The British troops then inflicted severe punishment on the insurgent clans, destroying their villages, and seizing large numbers of cattle for sale. Montgomery District - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 17, p. 411 The district was part of the Lahore Division of Punjab Province. The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Montgomery District. In 1978, the name of Montgomery District was changed to Sahiwal District.

Most people either have no or mild symptoms and thus do not know they are infected. When symptoms do occur, they typically include small blisters that break open to form painful ulcers. Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, aching, or swollen lymph nodes, may also occur. Onset is typically around 4 days after exposure with symptoms lasting up to 4 weeks. Once infected further outbreaks may occur but are generally milder. The disease is typically spread by direct genital contact with the skin surface or secretions of someone who is infected. This may occur during sex, including anal and oral sex. Sores are not required for transmission to occur. The risk of spread between a couple is about 7.5% over a year. HSV is classified into two types, HSV-1 and HSV-2. While historically HSV-2 was more common, genital HSV-1 has become more common in the developed world. Diagnosis may occur by testing lesions using either PCR or viral culture or blood tests for specific antibodies. Efforts to prevent infection include not having sex, using condoms, and only having sex with someone who is not infected. Once infected, there is no cure. Antiviral medications may, however, prevent outbreaks or shorten outbreaks if they occur. The long-term use of antivirals may also decrease the risk of further spread. In 2015 about 846 million people (12% of the world population) had genital herpes. In the United States, more than one- in-six people have HSV-2. Women are more commonly infected than men. Rates of disease caused by HSV-2 have decreased in the United States between 1990 and 2010. Complications may rarely include aseptic meningitis, an increased risk of HIV/AIDS if exposed to HIV-positive individuals, and spread to the baby during childbirth resulting in neonatal herpes. Signs and symptoms Genital herpes affecting the penis In males, the lesions occur on the glans penis, shaft of the penis or other parts of the genital region, on the inner thigh, buttocks, or anus. In females, lesions appear on or near the pubis, clitoris or other parts of the vulva, buttocks or anus. Other common symptoms include pain, itching, and burning. Less frequent, yet still common, symptoms include discharge from the penis or vagina, fever, headache, muscle pain (myalgia), swollen and enlarged lymph nodes and malaise. Women often experience additional symptoms that include painful urination (dysuria) and cervicitis. Herpetic proctitis (inflammation of the anus and rectum) is common for individuals participating in anal intercourse. After 2‚Äì3 weeks, existing lesions progress into ulcers and then crust and heal, although lesions on mucosal surfaces may never form crusts. In rare cases, involvement of the sacral region of the spinal cord can cause acute urinary retention and one- sided symptoms and signs of myeloradiculitis (a combination of myelitis and radiculitis): pain, sensory loss, abnormal sensations (paresthesia) and rash. Historically, this has been termed Elsberg syndrome, although this entity is not clearly defined. =Recurrence= After a first episode of herpes genitalis caused by HSV-2, there will be at least one recurrence in approximately 80% of people, while the recurrence rate for herpes genitalis caused by HSV-1 is approximately 50%. Herpes genitalis caused by HSV-2 recurs on average four to six times per year, while that of HSV-1 infection occurs only about once per year.How the facts about Genital Herpes can help. By New Zealand Herpes Foundation. Retrieved June 2014 People with recurrent genital herpes may be treated with suppressive therapy, which consists of daily antiviral treatment using acyclovir, valacyclovir or famciclovir. Suppressive therapy may be useful in those who have at least four recurrences per year but the quality of the evidence is poor. People with lower rates of recurrence will probably also have fewer recurrences with suppressive therapy.2007 National Guideline for the Management of Genital Herpes. By Clinical Effectiveness Group at British Association for Sexual Health and HIV. Suppressive therapy should be discontinued after a maximum of one year to reassess recurrence frequency. Transmission Genital herpes can be spread by viral shedding prior to and following the formation of ulcers. The risk of spread between a couple is about 7.5% over a year (for unprotected sex). The likelihood of transferring genital herpes from one person to another is decreased by male condom use by 50%, by female condom by 50%, and refraining from sex during an active outbreak. The longer a partner has had the infection, the lower the transmission rate. An infected person may further decrease transmission risks by maintaining a daily dose of antiviral medications. Infection by genital herpes occurs in about 1 in every 1,000 sexual acts. Diagnosis Screening Testing peoples' blood, including those who are pregnant, who do not have symptoms for HSV is not recommended. This is due to concerns of greater harm than benefit, as there is a high false-positive rate and receiving a positive test result can cause other problems, such as relationship difficulties. Treatment Once infected, there is no cure. Antiviral medications, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, may prevent outbreaks or shorten outbreaks if they occur. The long-term use of antivirals may also decrease the risk of further spread. The longer a person has the virus, the fewer outbreaks they experience and the harder it will be to transmit to others, due to these specialty antigens and a strengthened immune system response. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication and reduces the pain and the number of lesions in the initial case of genital herpes. Furthermore, it decreases the frequency and severity of recurrent infections. It comes in capsules, tablets, suspension, injection, powder for injection, and ointment. The ointment is used topically and it decreases pain, reduces healing time, and limits the spread of the infection. In people experiencing their first episode of genital herpes oral acyclovir may reduce the duration of symptoms and lesions but the risk of adverse effects is not certain. There may also be little or no difference between topical acyclovir and placebo in terms of duration of symptoms and lesions and the risk of adverse effects. Valacyclovir is a prodrug that is converted to acyclovir once in the body. It helps relieve the pain and discomfort and speeds healing of sores. It only comes in caplets and its advantage is that it has a longer duration of action than acyclovir. An example usage is by mouth twice per day for ten days for primary lesion, and twice per day for three days for a recurrent episode.Canadian Guidelines on Sexually Transmitted Infections > Section 5 - Management and Treatment of Specific Infections > Genital Herpes simplex virus (HSV) Infections. from the Public Health Agency of Canada. Date Modified: 2013-02-01. Famciclovir is another antiviral drug that belongs to the same class. Famciclovir is a prodrug that is converted to penciclovir in the body. The latter is the one active against the viruses. It has a longer duration of action than acyclovir and it only comes in tablets. Epidemiology About 16 percent of Americans between the ages of 14 and 49 are infected with genital herpes, making it one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. More than 80% of those infected are unaware of their infection. Approximately 776,000 people in the United States get new herpes infections every year. Tests for herpes are not routinely included among STD screenings. Performers in the pornography industry are screened for HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea with an optional panel of tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis, but not herpes. Testing for herpes is controversial since the results are not always accurate or helpful. Most sex workers and performers will contract herpes at some point in their careers whether they use protection or not. History Early 20th century public health legislation in the United Kingdom required compulsory treatment for sexually transmitted diseases but did not include herpes because it was not serious enough. As late as 1975, nursing textbooks did not include herpes as it was considered no worse than a common cold. After the development of acyclovir in the 1970s, the drug company Burroughs Wellcome launched an extensive marketing campaign that publicized the illness, including creating victim's support groups. Research There are efforts to develop a vaccine for active outbreaks of the virus‚Äîdespite most cases being asymptomatic‚Äîbut the results thus far have not been able to do so or eliminate transmission.

The clathrate gun hypothesis refers to a proposed explanation for the periods of rapid warming during the Quaternary. The idea is that changes in fluxes in upper intermediate waters in the ocean caused temperature fluctuations that alternately accumulated and occasionally released methane clathrate on upper continental slopes, these events would have caused the Bond Cycles and individual interstadial events, such as the Dansgaard‚ÄìOeschger interstadials. The hypothesis was supported for the B√∏lling-Aller√∏d and Preboreal period, but not for Dansgaard‚ÄìOeschger interstadials, although there are still debates on the topic. General Gas- hydrate deposits by sector Studies published in 2000 attributed the hypothesis to be responsible for warming events in and at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, but the distinct deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) isotope ratio indicates the methane was released by wetlands instead. Although periods of increased atmospheric methane matches periods of continental-slope failure. At one point there seemed to be stronger evidence that runaway methane clathrate breakdown may have caused drastic alteration of the ocean environment (such as ocean acidification and ocean stratification) and of the atmosphere over timescales of tens of thousands of years during the Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum 56 million years ago, and most notably the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event, when up to 96% of all marine species became extinct, 252 million years ago. However, the pattern of isotope shifts expected to result from a massive release of methane does not match the patterns seen there. First, the isotope shift is too large for this hypothesis, as it would require five times as much methane as is postulated for the PETM, and then, it would have to be reburied at an unrealistically high rate to account for the rapid increases in the 13C/12C ratio throughout the early Triassic before it was released again several times. Yet, it is still argued that a potential positive feedback mechanism from clathrate dissociation would amplify future global warming. However, past hydrate dissociation at Svalbard eight thousand years ago has been attributed to isostatic rebound (continental uplift following deglaciation). The SWIPA 2017 report notes, \\"Arctic sources and sinks of greenhouse gases are still hampered by data and knowledge gaps.\\" =Possible release events= Two events possibly linked to methane excursions are the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event and the Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Equatorial permafrost methane clathrate may have had a role in the sudden warm-up of \\"Snowball Earth\\", 630 million years ago. However, warming at the end of the last ice age is not thought to be due to methane release. A similar event is the methane hydrate releases, following ice-sheet retreat during the last glacial period, around 12,000 years ago, in response to the B√∏lling-Aller√∏d warming. Mechanism Specific structure of a gas hydrate piece, from the subduction zone off Oregon Gas hydrate-bearing sediment, from the subduction zone off Oregon Methane clathrate, also known commonly as methane hydrate, is a form of water ice that contains a large amount of methane within its crystal structure. Potentially large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of the Earth, although the estimates of total resource size given by various experts differ by many orders of magnitude, leaving doubt as to the size of methane clathrate deposits (particularly in the viability of extracting them as a fuel resource). Indeed, cores of greater than 10 centimeters' contiguous depth had only been found in three sites as of 2000, and some resource reserve size estimates for specific deposits/locations have been based primarily on seismology. The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits in runaway climate change could be a cause of past, future, and present climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; some have suggested that this was a main factor in the planet warming 6 ¬∞C, which happened during the end-Permian extinction, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Despite its atmospheric lifetime of around 12 years, it has a global warming potential of 72 over 20 years, 25 over 100 years, and 33 when accounted for aerosol interactions. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen and hydroxyl radical content of the atmosphere. = Subsea permafrost = Subsea permafrost occurs beneath the seabed and exists in the continental shelves of the polar regions. This source of methane is different from methane clathrates, but contributes to the overall outcome and feedbacks. From sonar measurements in recent years researchers quantified the density of bubbles emanating from subsea permafrost into the ocean (a process called ebullition), and found that 100‚Äì630 mg methane per square meter is emitted daily along the East Siberian Shelf, into the water column. They also found that during storms, when wind accelerates air-sea gas exchange, methane levels in the water column drop dramatically. Observations suggest that methane release from seabed permafrost will progress slowly, rather than abruptly. However, Arctic cyclones, fueled by global warming, and further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could contribute to more rapid methane release from this source. = Metastable methane clathrates= Another kind of exception is in clathrates associated with the Arctic ocean, where clathrates can exist in shallower water stabilized by lower temperatures rather than higher pressures; these may potentially be marginally stable much closer to the surface of the sea-bed, stabilized by a frozen 'lid' of permafrost preventing methane escape. The so- called self-preservation phenomenon has been studied by Russian geologists starting in the late 1980s. This metastable clathrate state can be a basis for release events of methane excursions, such as during the interval of the Last Glacial Maximum. A study from 2010 concluded with the possibility for a trigger of abrupt climate warming based on metastable methane clathrates in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) region. = Ocean anoxia = In the past, euxinic (i.e. sulfidic) and anoxic events have occurred either over relatively short time scales (decades to centuries) due to a disrupting event such as a meteor impact or over tens of thousands to a few million years due to global changes in the Earth's climate. Both scenarios can result in the large scale release of methane and other greenhouse gases from the ocean into the atmosphere. It is postulated such a release could occur in a quick, explosive event due to the complex interplay of buoyancy forces and exsolution of dissolved gases in the ocean. Initially, the increased amounts of smoke and dust in the atmosphere would cause a relatively short period of stratospheric cooling but this would quickly be overtaken by the effects of global warming.  Current outlook  Most deposits of methane clathrate are in sediments too deep to respond rapidly, and modelling by Archer (2007) suggests the methane forcing should remain a minor component of the overall greenhouse effect. See also blog summary. Clathrate deposits destabilize from the deepest part of their stability zone, which is typically hundreds of metres below the seabed. A sustained increase in sea temperature will warm its way through the sediment eventually, and cause the shallowest, most marginal clathrate to start to break down; but it will typically take on the order of a thousand years or more for the temperature signal to get through. However, there is also a possibility for the formation of gas migration pathways within fault zones in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, through the process of talik formation, or pingo-like features. According to data released by the EPA, atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations in parts per billion (ppb) remained between 400‚Äì800ppb in the years 600,000 BC to 1900 AD, and since 1900 AD have risen to levels between 1600‚Äì1800ppb. Global averaged monthly mean atmospheric methane is currently at ~1860 ppb CH4, increases between 8.8 ¬± 2.6 through 2017 compare to an average annual increase of 5.7 ¬± 1.1 ppb between 2007 and 2013. A USGS metastudy in 2017 by the USGS Gas Hydrates Project concluded:Gas Hydrate Breakdown Unlikely to Cause Massive Greenhouse Gas Release, USGS Gas Hydrates Project, 2017 =Arctic Ocean= Potential Methane release in the Eastern Siberian Arctic Shelf Research carried out in 2008 in the Siberian Arctic showed millions of tons of methane being released, apparently through perforations in the seabed permafrost, with concentrations in some regions reaching up to 100 times normal levels. The excess methane has been detected in localized hotspots in the outfall of the Lena River and the border between the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea. At the time, some of the melting was thought to be the result of geological heating, but more thawing was believed to be due to the greatly increased volumes of meltwater being discharged from the Siberian rivers flowing north.Translation of a blog entry by √ñrjan Gustafsson, expedition research leader, 2 September 2008 The current methane release had previously been estimated at 0.5 megatonnes per year. Shakhova et al. (2008) estimate that not less than 1,400 gigatonnes of carbon is presently locked up as methane and methane hydrates under the Arctic submarine permafrost, and 5‚Äì10% of that area is subject to puncturing by open taliks. They conclude that \\"release of up to 50 gigatonnes of predicted amount of hydrate storage [is] highly possible for abrupt release at any time\\". That would increase the methane content of the planet's atmosphere by a factor of twelve, equivalent in greenhouse effect to a doubling in the current level of . This is what led to the original Clathrate gun hypothesis, and in 2008 the United States Department of Energy National Laboratory system and the United States Geological Survey's Climate Change Science Program both identified potential clathrate destabilization in the Arctic as one of four most serious scenarios for abrupt climate change, which have been singled out for priority research. The USCCSP released a report in late December 2008 estimating the gravity of this risk. A 2012 assessment of the literature identifies methane hydrates on the Shelf of East Arctic Seas as a potential trigger. Hong et al. 2017 studied methane seepage in the shallow arctic seas at the Barents Sea close to Svalbard. Temperature at the seabed has fluctuated seasonally over the last century, between -1.8 and 4.8 ¬∞C, it has only affected release of methane to a depth of about 1.6 meters at the sediment-water interface. Hydrates can be stable through the top 60 meters of the sediments and the current observed releases originate from deeper below the sea floor. They conclude that the increased methane flux started hundreds to thousands of years ago, noted about it, \\"..episodic ventilation of deep reservoirs rather than warming-induced gas hydrate dissociation.\\" Summarizing his research, Hong stated:  Continental slopes  Profile illustrating the continental shelf, slope and rise A trapped gas deposit on the continental slope off Canada in the Beaufort Sea, located in an area of small conical hills on the ocean floor is just 290 meters below sea level and considered the shallowest known deposit of methane hydrate. However, the ESAS region averages 45 meters in depth, and it is assumed that below the seafloor, sealed by sub-sea permafrost layers, hydrates deposits are located. Seismic observation in 2012 of destabilizing methane hydrate along the continental slope of the eastern United States, following the intrusion of warmer ocean currents, suggests that underwater landslides could release methane. The estimated amount of methane hydrate in this slope is 2.5 gigatonnes (about 0.2% of the amount required to cause the PETM), and it is unclear if the methane could reach the atmosphere. However, the authors of the study caution: \\"It is unlikely that the western North Atlantic margin is the only area experiencing changing ocean currents; our estimate of 2.5 gigatonnes of destabilizing methane hydrate may therefore represent only a fraction of the methane hydrate currently destabilizing globally.\\" Bill McGuire notes, \\"There may be a threat of submarine landslides around the margins of Greenland, which are less well explored. Greenland is already uplifting, reducing the pressure on the crust beneath and also on submarine methane hydrates in the sediment around its margins, and increased seismic activity may be apparent within decades as active faults beneath the ice sheet are unloaded. This could provide the potential for the earthquake or methane hydrate destabilisation of submarine sediment, leading to the formation of submarine slides and, perhaps, tsunamis in the North Atlantic.\\" Research by Klaus Wallmann et al. 2018 concluded that hydrate dissociation at Svalbard 8,000 years ago was due to the rebound of the seabed following ice- sheet retreat. As a result, the water depth got shallower with less hydrostatic pressure, without further warming. The study, also found that today's deposits at the site become unstable at a depth of ~ 400 meters, due to seasonal bottom water warming, and it remains unclear if this is due to natural variability or anthropogenic warming.

It is the first installment in the Assassin's Creed series. The game was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2007 and was made available on Microsoft Windows in April 2008. Also, the game can be played on Xbox One consoles via backward compatibility. The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The game primarily takes place during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land in 1191, with the plot revolving around the Secret Order of Assassins, based upon the Hashshashin sect. The player is, in reality, playing as a modern-day man named Desmond Miles, who, through the use of a machine named the \\"Animus\\", is allowed the viewing and controlling of the protagonist's genetic memories of his ancestors, in this case, Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad, a member of the Assassins. Through this plot device, details emerge of a struggle between two factions: the Knights Templar and the Assassins, over an artifact known as the \\"Apple of Eden\\", an ancient artifact used to control minds. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising its storytelling, visuals, art design, and originality, although the game was also criticized for the repetitive nature of its gameplay. Assassin's Creed won several awards at E3 in 2006, as well as several end-year awards after its release. The game spawned a sequel, Assassin's Creed II, which was released in November 2009. Since the release and success of Assassin's Creed II, subsequent games have been released, with various other Assassins and time periods.  Gameplay  Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective in which the player primarily assumes the role of Alta√Ør, as experienced by protagonist Desmond Miles. The primary goal of the game is to carry out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim, the leader of the Assassins. To achieve this goal, the player must travel from the Brotherhood's headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities‚ÄîJerusalem, Acre, or Damascus‚Äîto find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player minimal knowledge about the target and requires them to perform additional reconnaissance missions before attempting the assassination. These missions include eavesdropping, interrogation, pickpocketing, and completing tasks for informers and fellow Assassins. Additionally, the player may take part in any number of side objectives, including climbing tall towers to map out the city and saving citizens who are being threatened or harassed by the city guards. There are also various \\"additional memories\\" that do not advance the plot, such as hunting down and killing Templars and flag collecting. After completing each assassination, the player is returned to the Brotherhood and rewarded with a better weapon and/or upgrade before going after the next target or given another set of targets, with the player free to select the order of certain targets. The player is made aware of how noticeable Alta√Ør is to enemy guards as well as the current state of alert in the local area via the \\"Social Status Icon\\". To perform many of the assassinations and other tasks, the player must consider the use of actions distinguished by its type of profile. Low-profile actions allow Alta√Ør to blend into nearby crowds, pass by other citizens, or perform other non-threatening tasks that can be used to hide and reduce the alertness level; the player can also use Alta√Ør's retractable hidden blade to attempt low-profile assassinations. High-profile actions are more noticeable, and include running, scaling the sides of buildings to climb to higher vantage points, and attacking foes; performing these actions at certain times may raise the local area's awareness level. Once the area is at high alert, crowds run and scatter while guards attempt to chase and bring down Alta√Ør; to reduce the alert level, the player must control Alta√Ør as to break the guards' line of sight and then find a hiding space, such as a haystack or rooftop garden, or blend in with the citizens sitting on benches or wandering scholars. Should the player be unable to escape the guards, they can fight back using swordplay maneuvers. The player's health is described as the level of \\"Synchronization\\" between Desmond and Alta√Ør's memories; should Alta√Ør suffer injury, it is represented as deviation from the actual events of the memory, rather than physical damage. If all synchronization is lost, the current memory that Desmond is experiencing will be restarted at the last checkpoint. When the synchronization bar is full, the player has the additional option to use \\"Eagle Vision\\", which allows the computer-rendered memory to highlight all visible characters in colors corresponding to whether they are allies (blue), foes (red), neutral (white), or even the target of their assassination (gold). Due to Alta√Ør's memories being rendered by the computer of the Animus project, the player may experience \\"glitches\\" in the rendering of the historical world, which may help the player to identify targets, or can be used to alter the viewpoint during in-game scripted scenes should the player react fast enough when they appear. Story =Plot= In 2012, bartender Desmond Miles is kidnapped by agents of Abstergo Industries, the world's largest pharmaceutical conglomerate, and is taken to the headquarters in Rome, Italy. Under the guidance of Dr. Warren Vidic and his assistant Lucy Stillman, Desmond is forced to participate in a series of trials revolving around the \\"Animus\\", a machine capable of translating the genetic memories of his ancestors into a simulated reality. Vidic instructs him to relive the early years of Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad, a senior member of the Assassin Brotherhood during the time of the Third Crusade. His investigation reveals that Alta√Ør, blinded by arrogance, botched an attempt by the Assassins to retrieve an artifact, the Piece of Eden, from the forces of Robert de Sabl√©, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, leading to the death of one Assassin, and severely wounding another in the process. Though Alta√Ør manages to partially redeem himself by fighting off a Crusader attack on the Assassin home base of Masyaf, his mentor and superior, Al Mualim, orders him to assassinate nine individuals in order to regain his honor: * Tamir, an arms merchant in Damascus selling weapons to both sides. * Garnier de Nablus, the grandmaster of the Knights Hospitalier, who conducts alchemical experiments on the sick at his order's hospital in Acre. * Talal, the leader of a gang of slavers in Jerusalem. * Abu'l Nuquod, a pompous trader and regent of Damascus stealing money meant to fund the war. * William V, Marquess of Montferrat, the cruel and abusive regent of Acre. * Majd Addin (based on Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad), a tyrant who rules Jerusalem through fear. * Master Sibrand, the paranoid grandmaster of the Knights Teutonic, who plans to betray the Crusaders. * Jubair al Hakim, a scholar using his position to seize and destroy all written knowledge in Damascus. * Robert de Sabl√©, the grandmaster of the Templars, the ancient enemies of the Brotherhood. As Alta√Ør eliminates each target, he learns that all nine are secretly members of the Templar Order and that they were conspiring to locate an \\"Apple of Eden\\", a relic of a long-forgotten civilization said to possess god-like powers. During an initial attempt to assassinate Robert at a funeral in Jerusalem, Alta√Ør discovers that Maria, a young Templar agent, had disguised herself as him in order to buy enough time for Robert to negotiate an alliance between the Crusaders and Saracens against the Assassins. Sparing her life, Alta√Ør catches up to Robert in the camp of King Richard I and exposes his crimes. Unsure of whom to believe, Richard suggests a one-on-one duel to decide the truth, remarking that God will decide the victor. Upon sustaining a mortal wound from Alta√Ør, Robert confesses that he did not act alone, Al Mualim had also sought the Apple and betrayed the Assassins in the process. Returning to Masyaf, Alta√Ør finds both the inhabitants and Assassins under the control of the artifact, which is now held by Al Mualim. With the help of several Assassins brought in for backup, Alta√Ør storms the citadel and confronts his mentor in the gardens. Using the Apple, Al Mualim battles his apprentice with illusions before resorting to single combat. Alta√Ør stabs him with his hidden blade and tries to destroy the Apple, but instead unlocks a secret map within that reveals the location of countless other Pieces of Eden around the world. With the trials complete, Vidic reveals that Abstergo is the modern incarnation of the Templars. Lucy, who turns out to be a mole planted by the modern-day Assassins, mysteriously disappears. While awaiting her return, Desmond discovers strange drawings covering the walls of his room, which foretell a catastrophic event that will wipe out humanity. Development =Conception= After completing Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time near the end of 2003, Patrice D√©silets was instructed to begin work on the next Prince of Persia game, with plans for it to release on the seventh- generation consoles. However, at that time, neither Microsoft nor Sony had revealed what their next consoles would be. The initial development of the game from January 2004 was aimed as a PlayStation 2 title, following the same linear approach that The Sands of Time had taken. However, as more information came in about the capabilities of the next-generation consoles by September 2004, D√©silets' team considered expanding the Prince of Persia acrobatic gameplay into an open world which would be feasible on the newer systems. D√©silets wanted to move away from the lead character being a prince simply waiting for his reign to start, but a character that wanted to strive to be a king. He came upon one of his university books related to secret societies, and its first material related to the Assassins, and recognized that he could have the lead character in the game being the second-highest Assassin, seeking to be the leader of the group. As such, the game began work under the title Prince of Persia: Assassin, inspired by the life of Hassan-i Sabbah and making heavy use of Bartol's novel Alamut. The assassin character was fleshed out over the course of the game's three-year development in an iterative fashion. The team had some idea of how the character dressed from Alamut and other historical works, in all white-robes and red belt, but had to envision how to detail this in the game. One of the first concept sketches, drawn by animator Khai Nguyen suggested the concept of a bird of prey, which resonated with the team. The assassin was named Alta√Ør, meaning \\"bird of prey\\" in Arabic, and eagle imagery was used heavily in connection to the Assassins. The team did take some creative routes to meet narrative goals and avoid technical limitations of the consoles. Alta√Ør was to be a heroic character with a bit of a \\"badass\\" edge, and the artist borrowed elements of the G.I. Joe character Storm Shadow, a similarly-skilled hero. Rendering long flowing robes was impossible to do on the newer hardware, so they shortened the robe and gave it a more feathered look, resonating the \\"bird of prey\\" imagery. Similar routes were taken with other parts of the gameplay as to take liberties with accuracy as to make the game fun to play. The team wanted Alta√Ør's parkour moves to look believable, but sacrificed realism for gameplay value, allowing the player to make maneuvers otherwise seemingly impossible in real-life. Having \\"leaps of faith\\"s from high vantage points into hay piles and using hay piles to hide from guards was a similar concept which borrowed from Hollywood films, but D√©silets observed that Alamut described similar actions that the Assassins had undertaken. To drive the story, the team had to come up with some goal that both the Assassins and Templars were searching for. Philippe Morin had suggested using the apple of Eden, which the team initially thought to be a humorous aspect for everyone fighting over an apple. However, as they researched into the game more, the team found that many medieval paintings of royalty and other leaders holding spherical objects similar to globus cruciger that represented power and control, and recognized that an artifact named the Apple of Eden would fit well into this concept. Among this work was the idea of the Animus, which came about after the team's decision to focus on the Assassins. The team considered that the player would travel through several different cities, and potentially recount numerous assassinations over the past thousand years, including some fantastical ones such as John F. Kennedy which would require some element of time traveling. D√©silets had seen a program on DNA and human history and was inspired by the idea if DNA could store human memories, then they could have an in-game machine that could be used for time and location jumps as well as explaining other aspects of the game's user interface to the player. D√©silets considered this similar to what they had established in The Sands of Time. There, the game effectively is a story told by the Prince, and while in the game, should the player-character die, this is treated as a mistelling of the Prince's story, allowing the player to back up and retry a segment of the game. Ubisoft's marketing was not keen on the Animus idea, believing players would be confused and be disappointed that the game was not a true medieval experience. The game's first trailer show at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2006 focused heavily on the medieval elements due to this. Later marketing materials closer to the game's release hinted more directly at the science fiction elements of the game. =Programming= Initial work on the game was to expand out various systems from Prince of Persia to the open world concept with a team of 20 at Ubisoft Montreal. A new next-generation game engine, the Scimitar engine, was created to support the open world, though this would take about two years to complete during which the team used the Sands of Time engine for development; Scimitar eventually was renamed to AnvilNext and has been used for most of the following Assassin's Creed games and other titles at Ubisoft. Elements like wall-climbing were made more fluid, and the team worked to smooth other animation sequences; much of the improvements here came from programmer Richard Dumas and animator Alex Drouin, both whom had worked together on the same elements in Sands of Time. Level designers and artists recreating historical structures had to work together to make sure nearly every building could be climbable while still holding the game's historical appearances. This also helped them to give the feeling to the player that they had as much freedom as possible within the game, a concept that had originated from the success of the Grand Theft Auto series. In contrast to Prince of Persia, where the general path that the player takes through a level is predefined, the open world approach of this game required them to create cities that felt realistic and accurate to historical information but which the player had full freedom to climb and explore. Outside of special buildings, they crafted their cities like Lego bricks, with a second pass to smooth out the shapes of the cities to help with pathfinding and other facets of the enemy artificial intelligence. To encourage the player to explore, they included the various towers that help to reveal parts of the map. Historical, these cities had such landmark towers and inspired by those, the developers incorporated them into the map, making these points of interest and challenges for players to drive them to climb them. Another factor was guiding the player and devising missions for the player that still gave the player freedom for how to approach it but still creating specific moments they wanted the player to experience. For these cases, they used simple animations developed in Adobe Flash to lay out the fundamentals of what actions they wanted, and then crafted levels and missions around those. As they started to recognize the need for cities in this open world game, D√©silets wanted to make sure they were also able to simulate large crowds, as this had been a limiting factor due to hardware limitations during the development of The Sands of Time; with the PlayStation 2 hardware, they could only support having up to eight characters on screen for The Sands of Time, but the next-generation hardware was able to support up to 120 people. Having crowds in the game also led to the concept of \\"social stealth\\", where the main character could mask themselves in the open, in addition to staying out of sight on rooftops. D√©silets had come from an acting background, and one element he had incorporated into the game was to make the player-character feel more like they were controlling parts of a puppet so that the character would appear more human. This led to the use of high- and low-profile action in gameplay that served in part as expressing the character's emotions, as well as allowing the player to continue to control the character during the game's cutscenes. The fundamentals of gameplay were completed within nine to twelve months, and another year was spent improving it before they presented the game to Ubisoft's executives in Paris. Jade Raymond was brought in in late 2004 to serve as the game's producer, helping with the team's growth and the game's direction. Around late 2005 to early 2006, following nearly two years of development, the concept for Prince of Persia: Assassin had the game's titular prince was AI-controlled, watched over by the player-controlled Assassin that served as the Prince's bodyguard and rescued the Prince from various situations. Ubisoft's management and the development had debates on this direction; Ubisoft's management wanted another game in the Prince of Persia franchise, and was not keen on releasing a game with that name where the Prince was not the lead character. The development team counters that with a new generation of consoles, they could potentially make it a new intellectual property. Near the 2006 Game Developers Conference, Ubisoft's marketing team came up with the idea of naming the game Assassin's Creed, which D√©silets recognized fit in perfectly with the themes they had been working on, including tying into the creed of the Assassins, \\"nothing is true; everything is permitted\\". The prince character was dropped and the game focused solely on the assassin as the playable character. Following the E3 2006 presentation and the name change to Assassin's Creed, the Ubisoft Montreal team grew to support the last year of the game's development, with up to 150 persons by the end of the process. Added team members included those that had just finished up production on Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones, as well as former staff that had recently been let go from Gameloft (another publisher owned by Ubisoft's co-founder Michel Guillemot). The Scimitar engine was completed, allowing the team to transfer their work and improve detail and art assets. According to Charles Randall, the lead AI developer for the game's combat systems, the game originally only was based around the main missions of assassinating the main targets and had no side quests. About five days before they were to have sent the final version for mass production, they were contacted by their CEO who said his son had played the game and found it \\"boring\\", and gave them a missive to add side quest. The team spent the next five days hastily rushing to add the collecting side quests to give it more depth and trying to make sure these were bug-free to make their mass production deadline. While a few noted bugs did fall through, they otherwise had met this target. =Voice acting= On September 28, 2006, in an interview with IGN, producer Jade Raymond confirmed that Alta√Ør is \\"a medieval hitman with a mysterious past\\" and that he is not a time traveler. In a later interview on December 13, 2006, with IGN, Kristen Bell, who lent her voice and likeness to the game, talked about the plot. According to the interview, the plot centers on genetic memory and a corporation looking for descendants of an assassin. On October 22, 2007, in an IGN Australia interview with Patrice Desilets mentioned that the lead character's climbing and running were done by \\"Alex and Richard ‚Äì the same guys from Prince of Persia.\\" Alta√Ør is voiced by actor Philip Shahbaz,Philip Shahbaz and his face is modelled on Francisco Randez, a model from Montr√©al. [Assassin's Creed Francisco Randez pr√™te son visage √† Alta√Ør] lienmultimedia.com. Retrieved April 15, 2008. Al Mualim's character is roughly based on Rashid ad-Din Sinan, who was the leader of the Syrian branch of the Hashshashin in 1191 and was nicknamed \\"The Old Man of the Mountain\\". Al Mualim was referred to as Sinan in Assassin's Creed: Alta√Ør's Chronicles. =Release= The game was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on November 13, 2007, in North America, November 16 in Europe, and November 21 in Australia and New Zealand. It was made public in April 2008 that Assassin's Creed would be sold digitally and available for pre-order through Valve's software distribution Steam. The PC version of Assassin's Creed was released on April 8, 2008, in North America. Four bonus mission types, not seen in the console versions, are included. These four missions are archer assassination, rooftop race challenge, merchant stand destruction challenge, and escort challenge. Because of these four exclusive missions only available on the PC, it was released and is sold under the name of \\"Director's Cut Edition\\". A pirated version of the game has been in existence since late February 2008. According to Ubisoft, a computer bug was purposely inserted into the pre- release version of the game by the publisher itself to unpredictably crash the game and prevent completion as a security measure, though players were able to use extra content available on the Internet to bypass it. The pirated version of Assassin's Creed was one of the most popular titles for piracy during the first week of March 2008. The presence of the bug and performance of the pirated version of the game was believed by Ubisoft to lead to \\"irreparable harm\\" for the game and resulted in low retail sales; NPD Group reports that 40,000 copies of the PC title were sold in the United States in July, while more than 700,000 copies were illegally downloaded according to Ubisoft. In July 2008, Ubisoft sued disc manufacturer Optical Experts Manufacturing, believing the company to be the source of the leak, citing poor security procedures that allowed an employee to leave with a copy of the game. A digital rights management-free version of the game was later made by GOG.com, a digital distribution store and a subsidiary of CD Projekt and CD Projekt Red. It is available on the GOG Store and GOG Galaxy. On July 10, 2007, during Microsoft's E3 press conference, a demo was shown taking place in Jerusalem. Features that were demonstrated included improved crowd mechanics, the \\"chase\\" system (chasing after a target trying to flee), as well as deeper aspects of parkour. This was the first time when Alta√Ør could be heard speaking. It was again showcased for 20 minutes on July 11, 2007. A video showed an extended version of the E3 demo and included Alta√Ør trying to escape after his assassination of Talal the Slave Trader. Music Jade Raymond, producer of Assassin's Creed said: \\"For Assassin's Creed we wanted the score to capture the gruesome atmosphere of medieval warfare but also be edgy and contemporary.\\" The musical score was composed by Jesper Kyd in 2007. Six tracks were made available online to those who have purchased the game; a password was given to people to insert at the soundtrack section of the Ubisoft website. Several tracks are also available to listen to on Kyd's MySpace and his official website. The released tracks as a whole have the archaic Latin chorus and dark orchestral music, while the track \\"Meditation Begins\\" features a kind of Saltarello with a very ominous, dark, ambient overtone with men whispering in Latin. The atmosphere in these tracks is what Jesper Kyd is known for and is effective in situ. The soundtrack is available from various online music stores. While the song \\"The Chosen (Assassin's Creed)\\" by Intwine featuring Brainpower was made contributing to the game, it was not featured in the game nor its soundtrack. Other songs that were used in previews and trailers such as \\"Teardrop\\" by Massive Attack and \\"Lonely Soul\\" by UNKLE also are not present on the soundtrack.  Reception  Assassin's Creed received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Several publications such as Eurogamer, while still awarding the game decent scores, pointed out a number of significant shortcomings. Eurogamer stated that the gameplay \\"never evolves and ultimately becomes a bit boring, and quite amazingly repetitive.\\" In Andrew P.'s review for EGM (Kage), he wrote that the game features \\"a challenging parkour path of escape...\\"Andrew P., \\"Review of Assassin's Creed,\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly 224 (January 2008): 89. Famitsu awarded the Xbox 360 version of Assassin's Creed a 36 (9, 9, 9, 9), while the PS3 version received a 37 (10, 8, 9, 10) out of 40, positively citing the story, presentation, and acrobatics, while criticizing the one button combat, map layout, and camera problems. Game Informer awarded Assassin's Creed a 9.5 out of 10, praising the control scheme, replay value, and intriguing story, but expressing frustration over the \\"repetitive\\" information gathering missions.Game Informer, December 2007 issue On The Hotlist on ESPNEWS, ESPN's Aaron Boulding called the game's concept of social stealth \\"fairly original\\" and added, \\"Visually, the developers nailed it.\\"ESPN ‚Äì Easy Points ‚Äì 'Tis the Season ‚Äì Videogames GameTrailers similarly praised the story (giving a 9.7 score to its story), and also cited repetitive gameplay and \\"moronic\\" AI as somewhat stifling its potential. \\"Assassins Creed is one of those games that breaks new ground yet fails in nailing some fundamentals,\\" said Gametrailers. The game also received a 10 out of 10 from GamesRadar. According to GamePro, Assassin's Creed is one of the \\"finest gaming experiences ever created\\" if you are willing to be \\"patient\\" due to the lack of fast-paced action. Hypers Darren Wells commends the game for its \\"great story, great graphics and intuitive controls.\\" However, he criticised it for \\"some missions that don't feel right on the PC and its loopy menu system.\\" Hilary Goldstein of IGN gave the game a 7/10, but was rather unimpressed compared to other critics, stating that \\"a bad story, repetitive gameplay elements, and poor AI lead to the downfall of one of the more promising games in recent memory.\\" He does give compliments to the combat animations and the climbing mechanic, and admired how accurately Ubisoft depicted the major cities of Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus to their real-life counterparts. = Accolades = Assassin's Creed won several awards at E3 2006.

He was a Lingayat religious figure, he joined the Siddaganga Matha in 1930 Karnataka and became head seer from 1941. He also founded the Sri Siddaganga Education Society. Described as the most esteemed adherent of Lingayatism, he was referred to as Nadedaaduva Devaru (walking God) in the state. Before his death at the age of 111 years, 295 days, he was one of the oldest people living in India. In 2015, he was awarded by the Government of India the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian award. Early life Shivanna was born on 1 April 1907 in Veerapura, a village near Magadi in the erstwhile Kingdom of Mysore (in present-day Ramanagara district of Karnataka state). He was the youngest of thirteen children of Gangamma and Honne Gowda. Having been devoted followers of the deities Gangadhareshwara and Honnadevi, Shivanna's parents took him to the shrines in Shivagange, alongside other religious centres around Veerapura. His mother Gangamma died when he was eight. Shivanna completed his elementary education in a rural Anglo-vernacular school in Nagavalli, a village in the present-day Tumkur district. He passed his matriculation in 1926. He was also a resident-student at the Siddaganga Math for a brief span during this time. He enrolled in Central College of Bangalore to study in arts with physics and mathematics as optional subjects, but was unable to earn the bachelor's degree as he was named successor of Uddana Shivayogi Swami to head the Siddaganga Matha. Shivanna was proficient in Kannada, Sanskrit and English languages. After losing his friend and the heir to head the Siddaganga Matha, Sri Marularadhya, on 16 January 1930, Shivanna was chosen in his place by the incumbent chief Shivayogi Swami. Shivanna, then renamed Shivakumara, entered the viraktashram (the monks' order) on 3 March that year upon formal initiation, and assumed the pontifical name Shivakumara Swami. He assumed charge of the Matha on 11 January 1941, following the death of Shivayogi Swami. Social work The Swami founded a total of 132 institutions for education and training, that range from nursery to colleges for engineering, science, arts and management as well as vocational training. He established educational institutions which offer courses in traditional learning of Sanskrit as well as modern science and technology. He was widely respected by all communities for his philanthropic work. The Swami's gurukula houses more than 10,000 children from ages five to sixteen years at any point in time and is open to children from all religions, castes, and creeds who are provided free food, education, and shelter (Trividha Daasoha). The pilgrims and visitors to the mutt also receive free meals. Under the Swami's guidance, an annual agricultural fair is held for the benefit of the local population. The Government of Karnataka announced the institution of Shivakumara Swamiji Prashasti from 2007, the centennial birth anniversary of Swamiji. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, visited him at Tumkur and praised the initiatives of Swami in education and humanitarian work. Illness and death In June 2016, Swami was hospitalised with jaundice and discharged later after treatment. He was again hospitalised in May 2017 and was diagnosed with various infections but completely recovered after treatment. In September 2017, he was hospitalised again. In January 2018, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and a gallbladder infection, but made a full recovery after a brief hospitalisation. In June 2018, he was hospitalised again for a recurrence of the gallbladder infection. All of these treatments happened in BGS Hospital Bangalore and was treated by Dr. Ravindra B.S., chief of medical gastroenterology at the BGS Gleneagles Global Hospitals. The Swami returned to hospital on 1 December 2018, after suffering from a liver tube infection. Although he was initially discharged, he was admitted again two days later. On 8 December, he underwent liver bypass and gallbladder removal surgeries, performed by Mohamed Rela. The surgeries were successful and the Swami was discharged after various days spent in the intensive care unit. On 29 December, he was diagnosed with a lung infection and on 3 January 2019, he was hospitalised again. On 11 January, he was placed on life support as his conditions deteriorated. On 16 January, despite a complete lack of recovery, the Swami was shifted back to Siddaganga Matha as per his own will. On 21 January, it was reported that he was in a critical condition after his pulse and blood pressure dropped. Attempts to revive him failed and he was pronounced dead at 11:44 a.m. (IST) that day. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Swami on 24 September 2014 The Government of Karnataka declared a public holiday on 22 January as part of the three-day state mourning period in a mark of respect.  Awards and recognitions  In recognition of his humanitarian work, the Swami was conferred with an honorary degree of Doctor of Literature by the Karnataka University in 1965. On his centenary in 2007, the Government of Karnataka awarded Swami the prestigious Karnataka Ratna award, the highest civilian award of the state. In 2015 the Government of India awarded him the Padma Bhushan. In 2017, the Government of Karnataka and his followers sought Bharat Ratna for him for his social service.

Brand history Log Cabin syrup was introduced in 1887. Grocer Patrick James Towle (1835-1912), who lived in the village of Forest Lake, Minnesota, initially formulated it. He named the syrup in honor of his childhood hero, Abraham Lincoln, who served the 16th Administration of Presidencies of the United States and who was famed for having spent his childhood living in a log cabin. Acquisitions The brand was acquired by General Foods in 1927, and it remained one of that company's major brands for decades, General Foods merged with Kraft in 1990, and Kraft General Foods sold the Log Cabin brand to Aurora Foods in 1997. Under Aurora's ownership, Log Cabin partnered with the National Park Service to restore some historic log cabins. But after Aurora Foods went bankrupt, Pinnacle Foods acquired it in March 2004. Marketing In the 1970s the product was endorsed on television commercials by singer Eddy Arnold. The newest version of Log Cabin syrup has eliminated high-fructose corn syrup, believed by some to increase the risk of obesity. It is the first American brand to eliminate the ingredient, though it does still contain corn syrup.

Example  =Australia= In Australia, federal elections in recent times have usually involved a House of Representatives election and a half-Senate election occurring on the same day.\\"Party Voting and Partisan Decline in Australia\\", Maurice Rickard, Parliamentary Fellowship. Monograph, , Commonwealth of Australia, 2007 split-ticket voting = someone votes for different parties in the House of Representatives and in the Senate Most states, with the exception of Queensland and Tasmania,The Parliament of Queensland has only one house, while the Tasmanian Legislative Council is elected in staggered terms every May. also hold elections for both houses of parliament simultaneously. An example of split-ticket voting in Australia is a voter who gives their first preference to the Liberal Party on the House of Representatives ballot paper and to the One Nation party in the Senate. In the 2013 election, the Senate vote for both the Liberal and Labor parties was considerably lower than their lower house vote, demonstrating that a large number of people voted for a major party in the House of Representatives and a minor party or micro-party in the Senate.http://results.aec.gov.au/17496/Website/Default.htm There are many reasons why a voter may do this, including the fact that many parties only stand candidates for the Senate (leaving their supporters unable to vote for them on their lower house ballot), the much lower quota required for election to the Senate compared to the House of Representatives (14.3% versus 50%), and a desire to check the power of the government by preventing it from controlling the Senate. From 1978 to 2008, when the Australian Democrats held representation in the Senate, the Democrats benefited greatly from split- ticket voting, as their Senate vote was always much higher than their House of Representatives vote.Sharman, C 1999, 'The representation of small parties and independents in the Senate', Australian Journal of Political Science, vol. 34, no. 3, pp. 353-361. The party built its campaigns around \\"keeping the bastards honest\\", a reference to holding the balance of power in the Senate so as to prevent the chamber from becoming either a rubber stamp for the government or a tool of obstruction for the opposition. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom the Additional Member System is used for the devolved assemblies of Scotland and Wales, as well as the London Assembly and is considered to increase the likelihood to split-ticket. As each voter casts two votes: one vote for a candidate standing in their constituency (with or without an affiliated party), and one vote for a party list standing in a wider region. In the constituency vote a single representative is elected using the traditional First-Past-The-Post system. The regional vote is used to elect multiple representatives from party lists to stand in regional seats, taking into account how many seats were gained by that party in the constituency vote, using a system of proportional representation: the number of seats a party receives will roughly reflect its percentage of the vote. Between the 1997 and 2003 elections in London, Scotland, and Wales between 17 and 28 percent of voters split their tickets. =United States= In the United States, multiple elections for many different offices are often held on the same day. This may be true of primary elections and may also include the placing of candidates for federal, state, and local offices on the same ballot. One of many possible examples of split-ticket voting in the United States is a voter who seeks to elect the Democratic Party's candidate for the Senate, the Republican Party's candidate for House of Representatives, the Green Party's candidate for County Supervisor, and the Libertarian Party's candidate for Coroner. One example is the 2004 elections in Montana, where Democratic gubernatorial candidate Brian Schweitzer was elected governor 50.4% to 46.0%, while incumbent Republican President George W. Bush defeated Democrat John Kerry 59% to 39%. This suggests that a large number of the electorate voted for a split-ticket, selecting a Republican presidential candidate and a Democratic Party gubernatorial candidate. Another example is the 2016 West Virginia gubernatorial election, in which Democrat (now Republican) Jim Justice won by 8 points while Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won in the state with 68% of the vote. However, Democratic candidates seeking governorships in red states often hold somewhat more conservative views compared to those of a typical registered Democrat, whereas Republicans running for governor in blue states often have more liberal views compared to those of an average Republican supporter elsewhere. For example, Massachusetts, despite being one of the most solidly Democratic states in national elections, elected Republican governors in 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2014, and 2018. In 2018, Republican Governor Charlie Baker was reelected in a landslide, winning about two thirds of the vote and sweeping every county. Meanwhile, at the exact same time, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren won reelection by over 20 points, and all 9 Representatives of Massachusetts (all Democrats) won their reelections. Motivations Although less common, split-ticket voting can potentially be used as a form of tactical voting. One possible example of this is a voter who prefers candidate A but does not believe that candidate A can win the election, so the voter votes for candidate B (who may be of a different political party from candidate A) because candidate B is better than other more competitive candidates C, D, etc. Split-ticket voting may also occur in elections where multiple voting systems are employed. One possible example of this is a voter who selects a candidate from a minority party for an office decided by a proportional representation election system and selects a candidate from a larger party for an office decided by a first past the post system. Split-ticket voting in party list voting systems is called panachage; not all implementations allow it. Split ticket preferences Split ticket voting is different from split ticket preferencing, often referred to as a \\"split ticket\\". In the latter, the candidate for political office (or the party they are standing for) will issue 'How to vote' cards or pamphlets which provide two different suggested alternatives on how voters who wish to vote for them should direct their second, third and subsequent preferences.\\"Could Katter win Blair for Labor?\\" Joel Gould The Queensland Times, 26 August 2013\\"Antony Green's Election Guide\\", ABC, 2010How to vote in Australian elections A guide to preferential voting in State and Federal elections References Category:Voting ","title":"Split-ticket voting"},{"id":"5069637","text":"You is the English second-person pronoun.

The name comes from the play La Princesse Lointaine by Edmond Rostand (1895), and draws on medieval romances. The romantic interest of many knights errant, she was usually a woman of much higher birth, often far distant from the knight, and usually wealthier than he was, beautiful, and of admirable character. Some knights had, indeed, fallen in love with the princess owing to hearing descriptions of her, without seeing her, as tales said Jaufr√© Rudel had fallen in love with Hodierna of Tripoli. Amour de loin (\\"Love from long away\\") is a term used in romances and their study. The term has been used subsequently to refer to women whose chief characteristic as love interests has been their unattainability. It may also be used metaphorically for unattainable objects or targets of various sorts. At times, the idealised lady of courtly love could be a princesse lointaine, a far-away princess, and some tales told of men who had fallen in love with women whom they had never seen, merely on hearing their perfection described, but normally she was not so distant. As the etiquette of courtly love became more complicated, the knight might wear the colors of his lady: where blue or black were sometimes the colors of faithfulness, green could be a sign of unfaithfulness. Salvation, previously found in the hands of the priesthood, now came from the hands of one's lady. In some cases, there were also women troubadours who expressed the same sentiment for men.

The explosions killed 41 people and injured more than 150. The primary explosion was due to natural gas leaking from one or more faulty transmission lines under the Marting Arms sporting goods store, located on the southeast corner of the intersection of 6th and Main (US 40) streets. A secondary explosion was caused by gunpowder stored inside the building. Gas had been smelled leaking in the area for days before the explosion, and local stores would open doors to allow the fumes to ventilate out and leave buildings. Location of Richmond in the state of Indiana Cause The explosion was due to a gas leak from a cast iron gas main which exploded outside Marting Arms. The pipe, which had become perforated as a result of corrosion, belonged to the Richmond Gas Corporation. It was uncertain what precisely had ignited the gunpowder, owing to the damage caused by the explosion and fire. A U.S. Bureau of Mines report found that just days before the explosion the Richmond Gas Corporation had found 55 gas leaks in its pipes, 7 of which were ‚Äúexceptionally large...creating hazardous conditions.‚Äù The gas company had found a smaller leak between Marting Arms and Vigran's Variety Store. The perforated pipe was removed by gas company workers during the post-explosion cleanup, but the gas company refused to allow bureau investigators to examine it. The corporation eventually provided the pipe for examination upon the order of the Indiana Public Service Commission. Safety checks after the explosion found 20 gas leaks in the city in the next 2 months, although some of these may have been caused by the explosion. Lawsuits and fate of Richmond Gas Corporation Three hundred ninety-seven lawsuits were filed against Richmond Gas Corporation, the City of Richmond, and Marting Arms pursuant to the explosion, but only one on behalf of decedent Blaine Scott Reeves made it to trial. The gas company was found solely liable by a jury in Connersville, Indiana where the case had been tried after the company requested a change of venue. It appealed the verdict based on alleged trial errors and on its claim that the award of $250,000 was excessive. On October 1, 1973, the First District Court of Appeals of Indiana ruled against the gas company and upheld the verdict. The corporation settled the remaining lawsuits for a reported $5 to $10 million. In 1990 Richmond Gas Corporation was acquired by Indiana Energy, Inc. (which merged into Vectren in 2000, which merged into CenterPoint Energy in 2019). Aftermath Twenty buildings in and near the site of the explosion were condemned as a result of the explosions. Ultimately, Main Street (US 40) through downtown Richmond was closed to traffic and a downtown Promenade was built in 1972 (later expanded in 1978). This five-block pedestrian mall was converted to allow the street to be reopened to traffic 29 years after the explosion, in 1997, as part of an urban revitalization effort. Since 1972, US 40 has been re-routed to by-pass Main Street through downtown Richmond. On the day of the explosion, the ongoing nationwide riots, resulting from the assassination of Martin Luther King two days earlier, overshadowed the Richmond loss of life from 'something preventable'. Many people have attested that the aftermath brought together the townspeople to work together and overcome their grief and rebuild. The 1968 Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act, Pub.L. 90‚Äì481 enacted into law on August 12 of that year, imposed tougher federal regulations on the gas network as a response to the disaster. Memorials Monument honoring those who died in the April 6, 1968 explosion. A simple curved brick memorial honoring those lost in the tragedy, who ranged in age from 8 to 72-years-old, was erected in the downtown, with metal lettering: In memory of the forty-one persons who lost their lives in the tragic downtown explosion April 6, 1968, and with everlasting gratitude to those who helped give rebirth to this city. The memorial stands at the south- west corner of South Fifth and Main Streets on the grounds of the Wayne County Courthouse annex. In 2018, on the 50th anniversary of the explosion, a stone monument honoring those who died in the explosion was dedicated, and it resides at the Wayne County Historical Museum.

He also was a famous Egyptian football player and actor. He was nicknamed El Maestro because of his way of leading the Al Ahly football team to many victories. He then became the manager of the team, then member of the board of directors of the club. He finally became one of the most successful presidents of the club.  Early life  Saleh was born on September 11, 1930 in Dokki, Giza, and his father is Dr. Mohamed Selim, one of the pioneers of Anesthesiology in Egypt. Selim's father knew his mother, Zein El Sharaf, when she was undergoing surgery at his hospital. He married her and she gave birth to three males. Saleh was the eldest, followed by Abdel Wahab and Tareq. Saleh Selim has been a footballer since childhood. In Dokki, Giza. He joined the Orman junior high school team, then the high school team during his studies at the Saadia school in the same district. In 1944 he joined the junior ranks of Al Ahly club after being discovered by Mr. Hassan Kamel, supervisor of the club's team. He quickly succeeded in proving his presence and talent, and was promoted to the first team at the age of seventeen. He played his first game (friendly) in front of the Al Masry club in 1948, and Al Ahly won two goals to one with Saleh scoring the winning goal. Though his first official game was against in Alexandria in the third week of the Egyptian league championship season of 1948 and Al Ahly achieved victory. Career Selim joined Al Ahly club in 1944 as a football player. Later, he became the club's football team manager, then a member of the board of directors. Due to the fame he gained as a football player, Saleh was dragged into show business and starred in three movies.

(It is also the name of an independent not-for-profit organization in the UK supported by a charitable grant from the Esm√©e Fairbairn Foundation dedicated to promoting this technology.) The concept is that by monitoring the frequency of the power grid, as well as their own controls, intermittent domestic and industrial loads switch themselves on/off at optimal moments to balance the overall grid load with generation, reducing critical power mismatches.http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090609003228/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file41011.pdf page3 domestic and industrial As this switching would only advance or delay the appliance operating cycle by a few seconds, it would be unnoticeable to the end user. This is the foundation of dynamic demand control. In the United States, in 1982, a (now-lapsed) patent for this idea was issued to power systems engineer Fred Schweppe. Other patents have been issued based on this idea. Dynamic demand is similar to demand response mechanisms to manage domestic and industrial consumption of electricity in response to supply conditions, for example, having electricity customers reduce their consumption at critical times or in response to prices. Description of French EJP demand reduction tariff The difference is that dynamic demand devices passively shut off when stress in the grid is sensed, whereas demand response mechanisms respond to transmitted requests to shut off, The need for spinning reserve The power utilities are able to predict to a reasonable accuracy (generally to within one or two percent) the demand pattern throughout any particular day. This means that the free market in electricity is able to schedule just enough base load in advance. Any remaining imbalance would then be due either to inaccuracies in the prediction, or unscheduled changes in supply (such as a power station fault) and/or demand. Such imbalances are removed by requesting generators to operate in so called frequency response mode (also called frequency control mode), altering their output continuously to keep the frequency near the required value. The grid frequency is a system-wide indicator of overall power imbalance. For example, it will drop if there is too much demand because generators will start to slow down slightly. A generator in frequency-response mode will, under nominal conditions, run at reduced output in order to maintain a buffer of spare capacity. It will then continually alter its output on a second-to-second basis to the needs of the grid with droop speed control. This spinning reserve is a significant expense to the power utilities as often fuel must be burned or potential power sales lost to maintain it. The kind of generation used for fast response is usually fossil fuel powered which produces emissions of between 0.48 and 1.3 tonnes of CO2 equivalent for every megawatt hour (MWh) generated. Thus a significant environmental burden, in the form of increased greenhouse gas emissions, is associated with this imbalance. Local load control A clothes dryer using a load control switch to reduce peak demand In principle, any appliance that operates to a duty cycle (such as industrial or domestic air conditioners, water heaters, heat pumps and refrigeration) could be used to provide a constant and reliable grid balancing service by timing their duty cycles in response to system load. Because it is possible to measure grid frequency from any power outlet on the grid, it is possible to design controllers for electrical appliances that detect any frequency imbalance in real time. Dynamic-demand enabled appliances would react to this same signal. When the frequency decreases they would be more likely to switch off, reducing the load on the grid and helping to restore the balance. When the frequency increases past the standard, they would be more likely to switch on, using up the excess power. Obviously, the controller must also ensure that at no point does the appliance stray out of its acceptable operating range. As line frequency is directly related to the speed of rotation of generators on the system, millions of such devices acting together would act like a huge, fast-reacting peaking power plant. Ancillary services The dynamic controller could also provide other ancillary services, such as aiding blackstart recoverythe ability of a power grid to be brought back to service after a power outage - if programmed with that function. Generally blackstarts are made more difficult because of the large number of reactive loads attempting to draw power simultaneously at start up when voltages are low. This causes huge overloads that trip local breakers delaying full system recovery. The dynamic controller could have these loads \\"wait their turn\\", as it were, until full power had been restored. Another vital balancing service is ‚Äòfast reserve‚Äô which is the use of standby plant to replace possible lost generation (e.g. due to a failed power generator or lost power line). By shedding load quickly while the running generators spin up, then switching back in to bring the frequency back to standard, dynamic controllers could spare the high cost of fast reserve generators. Also the fast response speed of this method would avoid possible brownouts occurring. The technology could also help facilitate greater use of generation from variable sources, like wind power. Demand-side techniques could be an efficient and cost-effective way to help integrate this resource onto the grid. In particular it would allow these sources to work in conjunction with virtual power reserves like municipal water towersDJ Hammerstrom et al., \\"Pacific Northwest GridWise‚Ñ¢ Testbed Demonstration Projects: Part I. Olympic Peninsula Project,\\" PNNL-17167, October 2007. to provide a reasonably predictable dispatchable capacity. Implementation issues Dynamic demand devices have the potential to save considerable amounts of energy by the services they provide. But before dynamic demand control can be widely incorporated regulation must be put in place to mandate installation on at least new appliances or an effective market mechanism must be created to reward installation of the technology fairly. One method contemplated is to enable the electricity meter that measures the electricity consumption also measure the grid frequency, and switch to a higher tariff if the frequency drops below a certain level. The monthly electricity bill will then say that so many hours (and so many kilowatt hours) were on the Regular tariff and a few hours on the Short Supply tariff. Those consumers without smart demand management have to pay the extra cost, but those who install smart technologies that adapt to the short supply periods will save money. On 1 March 2011, RLtec launched its Dynamic Demand frequency response service in hot water and HVAC load devices distributed across one of the UK‚Äôs largest supermarket chains, Sainsbury's. This megawatt scale virtual power plant service provides commercial frequency regulating response to National Grid in the UK. The company is now called Open Energi.http://www.openenergi.com/our- customers/sainsburys/ Frequency service and reserve service The national grid in the UK already is a massive user of this technology at an industrial scale - up to 2GW of load can be lost instantaneously by frequency sensitive relays switching off steelworks etc., which is matched over a 20-minute cycle by up to 2GW of quite small emergency diesel generators. For a complete description of this complex system see for example \\"Emergency Diesel Standby Generator‚Äôs Potential Contribution to Dealing With Renewable Energy Sources Intermittency And Variability\\" - a talk by David Andrews of Wessex Water who works closely with the UK National Grid to provide this service, given at the Open University Seminar \\"Coping with Variability - Integrating Renewables into the Electricity System\\" 24 January 2006. http://stadium.open.ac.uk/stadia/preview.php?s=1&whichevent;=720 Up to 5GW of such diesel generation is used in France for similar purposes, but these technologies seem to be relatively unknownhttp://www.claverton- energy.com/conference/programme. There is no reason they should not be massively increased in scopehttps://web.archive.org/web/20100217164416/http://www.claverton- energy.com/download/131/ to cope with even the intermittence introduced by wind power. UK government investigation In August 2007, the UK government published a report outlining what potential it sees for dynamic demand technology.http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file41011.pdf The report stops short of recommending the government encourage its introduction. It lists a number of technical and economic barriers to its introduction and recommends these be investigated before the government encourage the use of dynamic demand. Dynamic demand is one element of a wider government investigation into technologies that can cut greenhouse gas emissions. However, in 2009 it was announced that domestic refrigerators are now being sold into the UK incorporating a dynamic load control system.http://www.claverton- energy.com/bbc-talks-about-dynamic-demand-smart-fridges-and-smart- metering.html See also * Advanced Distribution Automation * Distribution management system * Demand response Dynamic demand on a smart grid * Electricity market * Electricity retailing * Energy demand management * Flexible AC transmission system * Grid friendly * GridLAB-D * List of energy storage projects * Energy Reduction Assets References External links * Dynamic Demand U.K. * Open Energi * A Note On the Potential Value of \\"Dynamic Demand\\" Control (in the UK/EU) * Category:Electric power distribution Category:Demand response ","title":"Dynamic demand (electric power)"},{"id":"5069919","text":"Joseph A. Farinholt (July 17, 1922 ‚Äì June 11, 2002) is thought to be the only enlisted man in the history of the U.S. military to receive four awards of the Silver Star, the United States third highest decoration for valor in combat. Service Joseph Farinholt was born in Catonsville, Maryland, in 1922. In 1938, he lied about his age to enlist in the Maryland National Guard's Company B, 5th Regiment (The Dandy Fifth). Farinholt was mobilized with his unit for service in World War II in January 1941, at which time the unit was reorganized as the 175th Infantry Regiment, 29th Infantry Division. Corporal Farinholt was assigned to the anti-tank platoon of Headquarters Company, 3rd Battalion, in which he initially served as an assistant gun-crew chief manning a 57 mm towed anti-tank gun, an American-produced British \\"6 Pounder\\". =First Silver Star= Farinholt earned his first Silver Star on July 13, 1944 near Saint L√¥ in Normandy, France when he fully exposed himself to enemy fire and with complete disregard for his own safety, neutralized an enemy mortar and anti-armor weapon, so that his battalion's attack could advance. For this action Farinholt was promoted to staff sergeant. =Second Silver Star= His second Silver Star came five days later on July 18, 1944, when in three of four days he led multiple, daring raids behind enemy lines to recapture weapons and equipment thought lost to the enemy. Baltimore News-Post correspondent Louis Azreal heard of Farinholt's exploits in the Normandy campaign and went looking for the story. On August 19, 1944, an article appeared on the front page of the News-Postarticle with the headline \\"Baltimorean Wins Tank Raid Medal.\\" All of Baltimore now knew of the man whose commander called him \\"Lightning.\\" =Third Silver Star= Promoted to technical sergeant, and now the senior non-commissioned officer in his platoon, Farinholt earned his third Silver Star in Germany's Aachen Gap on October 13, 1944. In this selfless action, Technical Sergeant Farinholt saved several lives while at great risk to his personal safety; in the midst of a blistering artillery barrage, he exposed himself to enemy fire and personally evacuated to safety several badly wounded men. =Fourth Silver Star= \\"Lightning at Bourheim\\" from the National Guard Heritage Series Farinholt's fourth Silver Star was earned on November 26, 1944 in Bourheim, Germany. The 175th Infantry had captured Bourheim three days earlier, but had to fight off at least six attempts by the Germans to retake the town. In the enemy's final attempt on November 26, they attacked with a heavy force that included Tiger I tanks from Schwere Panzer Abteilung (Funklenk) 301. After one of Farinholt's antitank gun crews was knocked out of action by a Tiger leading an armored column into Bourheim, he personally manned the gun, firing and neutralizing the tank by hitting a left rear road wheel and knocking off its track. In doing so, he temporarily blocked the enemy's route and brought to a halt their armored and infantry advance, but he was seriously wounded when the tank's machine gunner returned fire. Farinholt suffered 26 bullet and shrapnel wounds to his body, including having the tibia in his right leg completely shattered. Despite his severe injuries, and while still under fire, he managed to crawl to a nearby jeep in which he drove, with one leg, to the 3rd Battalion command post to warn its leaders of the coming attack. Farinholt's report led to an airstrike by P-47 Thunderbolts which decimated the attacking Germans. In 2001, Farinholt's fourth Silver Star was reviewed by the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records (ABCMR) for an upgrade to the Medal of Honor or Distinguished Service Cross. Despite acknowledging the veracity of Farinholt's valor and actions critical to the 175th Infantry's defense of Bourheim, the ABCMR declined to recommend upgrading the decoration, primarily because of a lack of living eyewitnesses who could make the Medal of Honor recommendation. The ABCMR also cited a reluctance to overrule the decision of the commanders on the ground at that time, even if it could be demonstrated that decision was shortsighted. It has been incorrectly reported that the paperwork for an upgrade of Farinholt's fourth Silver Star was lost during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack at the Pentagon. Repercussions Farinholt spent the next two years in Army hospitals, recovering from his wounds. Doctors were able to save his shattered right leg; however, the wound never completely closed and for 58 years, until his death in 2002, Farinholt cleaned and dressed the open wound twice each day. In 2005, The National Guard Bureau commissioned a painting of Farinholt's November 1944 action in Bourheim, Germany, for its Heritage Series, which depicts important battlefield contributions in American military history made by the National Guard. Other awards Farinholt's military awards and decorations include: the Combat Infantryman Badge, Silver Star Medal (with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters), Bronze Star, Purple Heart Good Conduct Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal (with Arrowhead and 4 Battle Stars), American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal and Belgian Croix de Guerre for valor. *60px Silver Star with three oak leaf clusters *60px Bronze Star *60px Purple Heart *60px Army Good Conduct Medal *60px American Defense Service Medal with Fleet Clasp *60px American Campaign Medal *60px European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with Arrowhead and 4 battle stars *60px World War II Victory Medal * Belgian Croix de Guerre with palm *100px Combat Infantryman Badge References Further reading *Answering Their Country's Call: Marylanders in World War II by Michael H.

Lee Moorhouse (1850-1926) of Pendleton, Oregon, United States, was a photographer and an Indian agent for the Umatilla Indian Reservation. From 1888 to 1916, he produced over 9,000 images documenting urban, rural, and Native American life in the Columbia Basin, and particularly Umatilla County, Oregon. Life Thomas Leander Moorhouse was born in Marion County, Iowa and as a child traveled along the Oregon Trail to Walla Walla, Washington with his family in 1861. As an adult, he worked as a miner, surveyor, rancher, businessman, civic leader, real estate operator, and insurance salesman. In addition to acting as an Indian agent, from 1879 to 1883 he served as an Assistant Adjutant General of the Third Brigade of the Oregon State Militia.http://library.uoregon.edu/speccoll/photo/Pendleton/fmoorhouse.html Photography Moorhouse considered himself an amateur photographer, but in the 1880s the hobby became an increasingly important part of his life. He knew Walter S. Bowman, a professional photographer in Pendelton.http://oregondigital.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/Moorhouse- wk&CISOPTR;=243&CISOBOX;=1&REC;=7 Unlike most amateur photographers of the period, Moorhouse worked with and mastered the cumbersome and exacting equipment of professionals, including gelatin dry glass plate negatives, large cameras, and a tripod. Critics believe his work reflects a keen eye, a deep appreciation for history and an intense interest in his world that went beyond the amateur. Moorhouse's photographs of members of the Cayuse, Walla Walla, and Umatilla are of particular significance. Like other Western U.S. photographers of this period, Moorhouse documented the appearance, costume and lifestyles of native peoples. Many of these characteristics were to disappear under Western cultural pressure. He, like other photographers of the time, depicted a romantic view of their subjects, staging shots to reflect their personal viewpoints and, in doing so, alter details and create inaccurate images. In Moorhouse's case, there are significant differences between two broad categories of his work with native people. His studio portraits of tribal members, which during his lifetime were considered his best work, are stiffly posed and probably inauthentic. Records indicate that Moorhouse supplied his subjects, from an extensive collection of Native American artifacts, with the clothing they wore and the implements they held. In contrast, his images of native life on the Umatilla Reservation accurately reflect native clothing and dwellings of the time. They also document some of the social and cultural transformations that native peoples experienced during this period of cultural conflict. Moorhouse's images have recently been recognized as valuable for eliciting the memories of the past among Umatilla tribal elders, with these stories adding to the archive of the native culture. Moorhouse also captured a significant variety of images on the development of the Oregon Territory. Six hundred views of ranch life, particularly wheat farming, document the ranchers, their homes, itinerant laborers, and their work in the fields. There are also thousands of images of small town and community life; businesses, schools, churches, and various forms of transportation, such as locomotives and automobiles. Social functions and entertainments appear in his photographs of circuses, parades, Wild West shows, and most notably the Pendleton Roundup in Pendleton, Oregon. Moorhouse published a short book of photographs and created postcards featuring his work. As many as 100,000 postcards may have been sold. Three hundred of his photographs were purchased by the U.S. Bureau of American Ethnology in the 1930s. Seven thousand images by Moorhouse are maintained by the Special Collections & University Archives of the University of Oregon Libraries; the Moorhouse family donated the photographs in 1948. Another 1,400 images were given to the Umatilla County Library in about 1958.  References  :Grafe, Steven L. Lee Moorhouse: Photographer of the Inland Empire.

Piebaldism is completely unrelated to conditions such as vitiligo or poliosis. Although piebaldism may visually appear to be partial albinism, it is a fundamentally different condition. The vision problems associated with albinism are not usually present as eye pigmentation is normal. Piebaldism differs from albinism in that the affected cells maintain the ability to produce pigment but have that specific function turned off. In albinism the cells lack the ability to produce pigment altogether. Human piebaldism has been observed to be associated with a very wide range and varying degrees of endocrine disorders, and is occasionally found together with heterochromia of the irises, congenital deafness, or incomplete gastrointestinal tract development, possibly all with the common cause of premature cutting off of human fetal growth hormone during gestation. Piebaldism is a kind of neurocristopathy, involving defects of various neural crest cell lineages that include melanocytes, but also involving many other tissues derived from the neural crest. Oncogenic factors, including mistranscription, are hypothesized to be related to the degree of phenotypic variation among affected individuals. Genetics This is an autosomal dominant hereditary condition, which tends to produce high rates of inheritance and long chains of generational transmission. All who inherit the gene have at some time in life evidence of piebald hypopigmentation of the hair or skin, most likely both. Piebaldism may be associated with the genes KIT or SNAI2. Diagnosis History Early photographers captured many images of African piebalds used as a form of amusement, and George Catlin is believed to have painted several portraits of Native Americans of the Mandan tribe who were affected by piebaldism.Victor A. McKusick, Mendelian Inheritance in Man: A Catalog of Human Genes and Genetic Disorders, Volume 1 (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1428-1429) Historically, persons with extensive piebaldism have experienced abuse of the sort still suffered in the present by albinos, especially in Africa. This has ranged from display of unclothed African piebalds in \\"freak\\" shows and post cards of the early twentieth century to the forcing of piebalds (as in the case of albinos) to work long hours exposed to the sun (producing high rates of lethal skin cancers), to the use of piebald humans, including children, in risky medical experiments. The National Organization of Albinism and Hypopigmentation, as well as organizations such as Under the Same Sun, work to promote awareness of all forms of cutaneous variation and their medical implications, and to highlight human rights issues, especially the plight of albinos subject to extreme persecution in parts of Africa. Etymology \\"Pie\\" is a word for multi-colored and \\"bald\\" is related to a root word for \\"skin.\\"  See also  References External links Category:Amino acid metabolism disorders Category:Autosomal dominant disorders Category:Disturbances of human pigmentation Category:Disturbances of pigmentation ","title":"Piebaldism"},{"id":"5070051","text":"Charles Henry Kerry Charles Henry Kerry (3 April 1857 ‚Äì 26 May 1928) was an Australian photographer noted for his photographs that contributed to the development of the Australian national psyche and romance of the bush.  Early life and career  Kerry was born on Bobundra Station in the Monaro region of New South Wales. He began working in the Sydney photo studio of A.H. Lamartiniere in 1875. When Lamartiniere fled from creditors a few years later, Kerry took charge of the company, paying debts and turning around the business. Initially Kerry specialised in portraits but branched into photographing Sydney scenery and society. He was also active in the postcard business. Eventually Kerry turned this small studio into Australia's largest photographic establishment.  Work and commissions  Skiers from the 1900 Kiandra Snow Shoe Carnival by Charles Kerry In 1885 Kerry was asked to prepare an exhibit of Aboriginal portraits and corroboree pictures for the 1886 Colonial and Indian Exhibition. In 1890, the Governor of New South Wales, Lord Carrington, appointed Kerry as his official photographer. In 1891 Kerry was commissioned to photograph the Jenolan and Yarrangobilly Caves. An innovative artist, Kerry used the still-experimental technique of magnesium flash powder to capture the interior of the Jenolan Caves. By 1900 Kerry handled the major illustrations for the local press. In 1908 he photographed the visit of the American Fleet and the Burns‚ÄìJohnson heavyweight boxing match. To gain an aerial view of the arrival of the Great White Fleet he mounted a camera on a box kite.  Photographic excursions  In 1895, Kerry began a Squatter's Service, travelling around the colony photographing squatter's land, homesteads, families and livestock. Charles Kerry first visited Kiandra in 1894 to pursue his mining interests, he returned in 1896 on a photographic tour. The following year with practically no skiing experience was assisted by group including Kiandra ski club members on an historic photography tour to the summit of Mount Kosciuszko. In 1909 he was elected Founding President of the Kosciusko Alpine Club, which led to the opening up of the area for skiing and the naming of a run after him. By 1898 he had the largest photographic establishment in Australia, a three floor building at 310 George Street, Sydney.  Later life  He employed professional photographers and after 1895 took fewer photographs himself. He left the firm in 1911 to concentrate on his mining interests. From 1913 he made a photographic tour of the Pacific, visiting Tonga, New Caledonia, Fiji, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Samoa. Later, in 1928 he accompanied a scientific party to the islands of the Great Barrier Reef. He died soon after his return at his home in the Northern Sydney suburb of Neutral Bay. In 1937 Sir Frank Packer named his son after Kerry. Kerry Packer became Australia's richest man. Kerry's son G. E. Marni Kerry was an early Australian aviator and friend of Charles Kingsford Smith.  Collections  About 8,000 glass negatives from his studio (including some negatives by Henry King which had been purchased by Kerry) were acquired in 1930 by Tyrrell's Bookshop, and this collection was purchased by Australian Consolidated Press in 1980 and donated to the Powerhouse Museum. Many of these were made freely available in the Commons on Flickr by the Powerhouse Museum in 2008.

During the late 1940s, the Benn brothers opened a flight school that included 10 Piper J-3 Cubs, two Cessna 120s, a Cessna 140, a Fairchild PT-19 and a Cessna UC-78 Bobcat in its inventory. The airport also had multiple hangars and administrative offices. By 1949, the airport was considered as one of the busiest general aviation airports in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area and attracted a number of airshows and events.\\"Washington-Virginia Airport\\" Aviation in Virginia; a state aeronautical survey.

The closure of that facility resulted in many of its aircraft relocating to the Washington-Virginia Airport. By the mid-1960s over 100 aircraft were housed in Washington-Virginia's hangars or on the fields adjacent to the runways. A 1968 Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association airport directory said that the airport offered fuel, repairs, hangar, flight instruction, and charter services and that bus, taxi, rental cars, food and lodging were also available. The airport's manager was listed as Charles D. Benn. The directory also stated that the airport had only one runway in use (12/30) as the north-south runway (17/35) had been closed at the request of the state for safety reasons.\\"1970-1971 Virginia Airport Directory\\" Division of Aeronautics, Virginia State Corporation Commission, page 15 Special restrictions Washington D.C. area airports, from the 1961 Code of Federal Regulations.

Accidents The 1970-1971 Virginia State Airport Directory featured a sketch of the airport that shows the location of both the 42' tall movie screen across Route 7 from the 17/35 runway as well as the 50' tall power line, also on the opposite side of the road The airport was the site of numerous accidents and mishaps, none of which were fatal. Many of the accidents were caused by the congested development around the airport. The placement of the 42' outdoor movie screen of the Sunset Drive-In on the other side of Virginia Route 7 was directly in the path of planes attempting to land in the 17/35 runway. On one landing attempt, a \\"tail-dragger\\" struck the object with its rear wheel and reportedly left a large black skid mark on the top of the screen. Also adjacent to the airport was a large Coca-Cola bottling plant that, at least on one occasion, was mistaken at night for a landing strip, causing the plant's owners to place a large white \\"X\\" on the building's roof in an attempt to dissuade pilots from landing on it. On another occasion, the airport hosted planes that were visually modified to look like Japanese Zeros for use in the movie Tora! Tora! Tora! Two of the planes collided on the ground resulting in the loss of a wing. Other notable accidents include the following: * 1950: Engine failure after take-off. Alvin P. Hines, 48, of Arlington County, was piloting a Piper Cub when the engine failed seconds after take-off. Hines estimated his altitude at approximately 150' when the engine stopped. Hines flew the plane into an area of brush and undergrowth south of Seminary Road. Along with his two passengers, eight-year-old Bill MacConnaughey of Woodbridge, Virginia and 19-year-old Mary Ann King of Rescue, Virginia, Hines walked out of the aircraft uninjured. The aircraft suffered bent landing gear, and a damaged fuselage. Hines attributed the engine failure to a clogged fuel line.\\"Piper Cub 'Conks Out' 150 Feet Up Shortly After Taking Off\\" (July 17, 1950) The Washington Post, page B1 * 1955: Plane strikes trees while attempting to land. Charles Benn of Arlington County and the owner of the Washington-Virginia Airport, along with a passenger, Alfred T. Vest also of Arlington County, received minor injuries when their plane crashed just short of the runway.\\"Plane Crash Injures 2 in Virginia\\" (March 24, 1955) The Washington Post, page 19 * 1964: Plane strikes trees while attempting to land. Christian Liechpy, a 23-year-old student pilot was blinded by lights along Route 7 as he was attempting to make a night landing. His plane, a single engine Ercoupe, struck a tree top and crashed in the Coca-Cola bottling plant parking lot adjacent to the airport. Liechpy was uninjured, but his passenger, 24-year-old Anthony Spiritosanto suffered two leg fractures. Both men lived in Arlington County, Virginia.\\"Passenger Hurt in Crash of Airplane\\" (January 7, 1964) The Washington Post, page A3 * 1967. Unknown cause. Roy McCabe of Woodbridge was seriously injured when he crashed his Cessna 140 aircraft shortly after takeoff from the airport.

Windy conditions caused a pilot to lose control of his plane as he was departing the airport. In an attempt to avoid a hangar at the end of the runway, the pilot, Thomas R. O'Pray of Arlington County, pulled up sharply, stalled the plane and crashed into the hangar he was trying to avoid. The 29-year-old pilot and his 16-year-old passenger, Dwain E. Bryant of Takoma Park, Maryland, received minor injuries. The four seat Stinson aircraft suffered considerable damage.Bredemeir, Kenneth (July 27, 1969) \\"Plane Dives Into Hangar, 2 Escape\\" The Washington Post, page 58 * 1970: Plane strikes power lines while attempting to land. A Piper Cherokee was destroyed and its two occupants seriously injured when the plane struck a 34,000 volt power line while descending to land at the airport. The two occupants were 46-year-old Daniel C. White and 36-year-old James M. Robinson, both of Arlington County. The power line fell onto a metal fence surrounding the airport and electrified it, starting numerous brush fires that forced the Virginia State Police to close Route 7. Businesses and homes in the area lost power for several hours as a result of the accident.Hodge, Paul (May 11, 1970) \\"Two Injured in County Air Crash\\" The Washington Post, page B1 Closure and aftermath Complaints about the Washington-Virginia Airport dated back to the early 1950s when Marshall J. Beverley, the mayor of Alexandria, characterized the airport as a \\"menace\\" that was \\"constantly terrorizing the inhabitants of [the] city.\\" Beverley lodged complaints with the Virginia State Aeronautics Division claiming that pilots using the airport were violating minimum altitude requirements and were flying less than 50 feet over cars on Route 7 while they were attempting to land. Beverley also directed that the Alexandria Police department monitor traffic at the airport which was located on the border of Alexandria City and Fairfax County, and arrest pilots who violated airspace rules.\\"New Plane Menace Seen By Beverley\\" (August 21, 1953) The Washington Post, page 12 By the late 1960s, the Washington-Virginia Airport faced the same problems many general aviation airports across the country faced: increasing real estate prices, high taxes, costly liability insurance and public opposition to aviation activity located in what had become, over time, a residential area.Day, Kathleen (September 21, 1987) \\"Small Airports Nosediving in Number\\" The Washington Post, page B-1 John D. Benn had voiced concerns about encroachment as far back as 1959 when he told the Washington Post that the farmland surrounding the airport that had been converted to commercial and residential areas posed a threat to safe airport operations. In the same interview Benn also mentioned that the value of the 106-acre airport had increased to over $1 million since he opened it for business in 1949.Hailey, Albon B. (December 8, 1959) \\"Suburbs Held Peril To Private Airports\\" The Washington Post, page B1 The Skyline Center was constructed on the site of the Washington-Virginia Airport in the 1970s. Following Benn's death in 1967, interest in re-purposing the Washington-Virginia began in earnest. In 1968 John D. Benn Jr. announced that he was in discussions with the Charles E. Smith Companies, a Washington D.C. area real estate developer, to convert the airport to an office complex. Earlier in the decade, Smith had converted a large underutilized area of Arlington County into a $120 million complex of offices and high-rise residential buildings called Crystal City. Benn stated that a similar development would be constructed at the location of the airport.Yenekel, James T. (August 28, 1968) \\"Crystal City Firm Eyes Area Airport\\" The Washington Post, page C4\\"Major Office Complex Eyed at Bailey's Crossroads\\" (October 18, 1968) The Washington Post, page D7 Plans were finalized a year later when the Benn family sold the airport to the Smith Companies, who announced plans to construct a $200 million office, retail and residential complex that would feature eight apartment buildings and underground parking for over 11,000 cars.Scannell, Nancy (October 21, 1969) \\"$200 Million Complex Planned\\" The Washington Post, page A11 The airport closed on October 18, 1970. Work on what was named the \\"Skyline Center\\" started in 1971 and continued until 1973 when it was halted by the collapse of the 26-floor \\"Skyline Plaza\\" apartment building. The accident took the lives of 14 construction workers and injured 35 others. The Washington-Virginia Airport, considered a danger to the public, had never experienced a fatal accident. Further work on the construction project was suspended until 1974 while the cause of the collapse was being investigated. The Skyline Center complex was completed in 1977.

These friction factors were first calculated by Jean-Baptiste Perrin. These factors pertain to spheroids (i.e., to ellipsoids of revolution), which are characterized by the axial ratio p = (a/b), defined here as the axial semiaxis a (i.e., the semiaxis along the axis of revolution) divided by the equatorial semiaxis b. In prolate spheroids, the axial ratio p > 1 since the axial semiaxis is longer than the equatorial semiaxes. Conversely, in oblate spheroids, the axial ratio p < 1 since the axial semiaxis is shorter than the equatorial semiaxes. Finally, in spheres, the axial ratio p = 1, since all three semiaxes are equal in length. The formulae presented below assume \\"stick\\" (not \\"slip\\") boundary conditions, i.e., it is assumed that the velocity of the fluid is zero at the surface of the spheroid. Perrin S factor For brevity in the equations below, we define the Perrin S factor. For prolate spheroids (i.e., cigar- shaped spheroids with two short axes and one long axis) : S \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ 2 \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{atanh} \\\\ \\\\xi}{\\\\xi} where the parameter \\\\xi is defined : \\\\xi \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\left p^{2} - 1 \\\\right}}{p} Similarly, for oblate spheroids (i.e., discus-shaped spheroids with two long axes and one short axis) : S \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ 2 \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{atan} \\\\ \\\\xi}{\\\\xi} For spheres, S = 2, as may be shown by taking the limit p \\\\rightarrow 1 for the prolate or oblate spheroids. Translational friction factor The frictional coefficient of an arbitrary spheroid of volume V equals : f_{tot} = f_{sphere} \\\\ f_{P} where f_{sphere} is the translational friction coefficient of a sphere of equivalent volume (Stokes' law) : f_{sphere} = 6 \\\\pi \\\\eta R_{eff} = 6\\\\pi \\\\eta \\\\left(\\\\frac{3V}{4\\\\pi}\\\\right)^{(1/3)} and f_{P} is the Perrin translational friction factor : f_{P} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\frac{2p^{2/3}}{S} The frictional coefficient is related to the diffusion constant D by the Einstein relation : D = \\\\frac{k_{B}T}{f_{tot}} Hence, f_{tot} can be measured directly using analytical ultracentrifugation, or indirectly using various methods to determine the diffusion constant (e.g., NMR and dynamic light scattering). Rotation friction factor There are two rotational friction factors for a general spheroid, one for a rotation about the axial semiaxis (denoted F_{ax}) and other for a rotation about one of the equatorial semiaxes (denoted F_{eq}). Perrin showed that : F_{ax} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\left( \\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\right) \\\\frac{p^{2}-1}{2 p^{2} - S} : F_{eq} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\left( \\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\right) \\\\frac{(1/p)^{2} - p^{2}}{2 - S \\\\left[ 2 - (1/p)^{2} \\\\right]} for both prolate and oblate spheroids. For spheres, F_{ax} = F_{eq} = 1, as may be seen by taking the limit p \\\\rightarrow 1. These formulae may be numerically unstable when p \\\\approx 1, since the numerator and denominator both go to zero into the p \\\\rightarrow 1 limit. In such cases, it may be better to expand in a series, e.g., : \\\\frac{1}{F_{ax}} = 1.0 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{4}{5}\\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\xi^{2}}{1 + \\\\xi^{2}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{4 \\\\cdot 6}{5 \\\\cdot 7}\\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\xi^{2}}{1 + \\\\xi^{2}}\\\\right)^{2} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{4 \\\\cdot 6 \\\\cdot 8}{5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 9}\\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\xi^{2}}{1 + \\\\xi^{2}}\\\\right)^{3} + \\\\ldots for oblate spheroids. Time constants for rotational relaxation The rotational friction factors are rarely observed directly. Rather, one measures the exponential rotational relaxation(s) in response to an orienting force (such as flow, applied electric field, etc.). The time constant for relaxation of the axial direction vector is : \\\\tau_{ax} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{k_{B}T} \\\\right) \\\\frac{F_{eq}}{2} whereas that for the equatorial direction vectors is : \\\\tau_{eq} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{k_{B}T} \\\\right) \\\\frac{F_{ax}F_{eq}}{F_{ax} + F_{eq}} These time constants can differ significantly when the axial ratio \\\\rho deviates significantly from 1, especially for prolate spheroids. Experimental methods for measuring these time constants include fluorescence anisotropy, NMR, flow birefringence and dielectric spectroscopy. It may seem paradoxical that \\\\tau_{ax} involves F_{eq}. This arises because re- orientations of the axial direction vector occur through rotations about the perpendicular axes, i.e., about the equatorial axes. Similar reasoning pertains to \\\\tau_{eq}.

Medina Sidonia was an aristocrat without naval command experience but was made commander by King Philip II. The aim was to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I and her establishment of Protestantism in England, to stop English interference in the Spanish Netherlands and to stop the harm caused by English and Dutch privateering ships that interfered with Spanish interests in the Americas. English ships sailed from Plymouth to attack the Armada and were faster and more manoeuvrable than the larger Spanish galleons, enabling them to fire on the Armada without loss as it sailed east off the south coast of England. The Armada could have anchored in The Solent between the Isle of Wight and the English mainland and occupied the Isle of Wight, but Medina Sidonia was under orders from King Philip II to meet up with the Duke of Parma's forces in the Netherlands so England could be invaded by Parma's soldiers and other soldiers carried in ships of the Armada. English guns damaged the Armada and a Spanish ship was captured by Sir Francis Drake in the English Channel. The Armada anchored off Calais.\\"The Safeguard of the Sea, A Naval History of Britain, 660‚Äì1649\\", N. A. M. Rodgers, Penguin, 2004, pp. 263‚Äì269 While awaiting communications from the Duke of Parma, the Armada was scattered by an English fireship night attack and abandoned its rendezvous with Parma's army, that was blockaded in harbour by Dutch flyboats. In the ensuing Battle of Gravelines, the Spanish fleet was further damaged and was in risk of running aground on the Dutch coast when the wind changed. The Armada, driven by southwest winds, withdrew north, with the English fleet harrying it up the east coast of England. On return to Spain round the north of Scotland and south around Ireland, the Armada was disrupted further by storms. Many ships were wrecked on the coasts of Scotland and Ireland and more than a third of the initial 130 ships failed to return. As Martin and Parker explain, \\"Philip II attempted to invade England, but his plans miscarried. This was due to his own mismanagement, including the appointment of an aristocrat without naval experience as commander of the Armada, but also to unfortunate weather, and the opposition of the English and their Dutch allies, which included the use of fireships sailed into the anchored Armada.\\" The expedition was the largest engagement of the undeclared Anglo-Spanish War (1585‚Äì1604). The following year, England organised a similar large-scale campaign against Spain, the English Armada, sometimes called the \\"counter-Armada of 1589\\", which was also unsuccessful.Elliott p.333 Etymology The word armada is from the , which is cognate with English army. Originally from the , the past participle of , used in Romance languages as a noun for armed force, army, navy, fleet.Oxford English Dictionary, 'armada' is still the Spanish term for the modern Spanish Navy. History =Background= Henry VIII began the English Reformation as a political exercise over his desire to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. Over time, it became increasingly aligned with the Protestant reformation taking place in Europe, especially during the reign of Henry's son, Edward VI. Edward died childless and his half-sister, Mary I, ascended the throne. A devout Catholic, Mary, with her co-monarch and husband, Philip II of Spain, began to reassert Roman influence over church affairs. Her attempts led to more than 260 people being burned at the stake, earning her the nickname 'Bloody Mary'. Philip II of Spain c. 1580, National Portrait Gallery, London Mary's death in 1558 led to her half-sister, Elizabeth I, taking the throne. Unlike Mary, Elizabeth was firmly in the reformist camp, and quickly reimplemented many of Edward's reforms. Philip, no longer co-monarch, deemed Elizabeth a heretic and illegitimate ruler of England. In the eyes of the Catholic Church, Henry had never officially divorced Catherine, making Elizabeth illegitimate. It is alleged that Phillip supported plots to have Elizabeth overthrown in favour of her Catholic cousin and heir presumptive, Mary, Queen of Scots. These plans were thwarted when Elizabeth had the Queen of Scots imprisoned and executed in 1587. Elizabeth retaliated against Philip by supporting the Dutch revolt against Spain, as well as funding privateers to raid Spanish ships across the Atlantic. She had also negotiated an enduring trade and political alliance with Morocco. In retaliation, Philip planned an expedition to invade England in order to overthrow Elizabeth and, if the Armada was not entirely successful, at least negotiate freedom of worship for Catholics and financial compensation for war in the Low Countries. \\"If the Armada is not as successful as we hoped but yet not entirely defeated, then you may offer England peace on the following terms. The first is that in England the free use and exercise of our Holy Catholic faith shall be permitted to all Catholics, native and foreign, and that those that are in exile shall be permitted to return. The second is that all the place in my netherlands which the English hold shall be restored to me and the third that they shall recompense me for the injury they have done me, my dominions and my subjects, which will amount to an exceeding great sum. With regard the free exercise of Catholicism, you may point out to them that since freedom of worship is permitted to the huguenots of France, there will be no sacrifice of dignity in allowing the same privilege to Catholics in England.\\" April 1588, Philip II to the Duke of Parma.

The King was supported by Pope Sixtus V, who treated the invasion as a crusade, with the promise of a subsidy should the Armada make land. \\"...the widespread suffering and irritation caused by the religious wars Elizabeth fomented, and the indignation caused by her religious persecution, and the execution of Mary Stuart, caused Catholics everywhere to sympathise with Spain and to regard the Armada as a crusade against the most dangerous enemy of the faith,\\" and \\"Pope Sixtus V agreed to renew the excommunication of the Queen, and to grant a large subsidy to the Armada but, given the time needed for preparation and actual sailing of the fleet, would give nothing until the expedition should actually land in England. In this way he eventually was saved the million crowns, and did not take any proceedings against the heretic queen.\\" Substantial support for the invasion was also expected from English Catholics, including wealthy and influential aristocrats and traders.Hutchinson, Robert. \\"10 things you (probably) didn‚Äôt know about the Spanish Armada\\". BBC History Extra, April 2005. Retrieved 5 April 2020 A raid on C√°diz, led by Francis Drake in April 1587, had captured or destroyed about 30 ships and great quantities of supplies, setting preparations back by a year. There is also evidence that a letter from Elizabeth's security chief and spymaster, Sir Francis Walsingham, to her ambassador in Istanbul, William Harborne, sought to initiate Ottoman Empire fleet manoeuvres to harass the Spaniards,Ezard, John. \\"Why we must thank the Turks, not Drake, for defeating the Armada\\". The Guardian, 1 June 2004. Retrieved 5 April 2020 but there is no evidence for the success of that plan. Philip initially favoured a triple attack, starting with a diversionary raid on Scotland, while the main Armada would capture the Isle of Wight, or Southampton, to establish a safe anchorage in The Solent. The Duke of Parma would then follow with a large army from the Low Countries crossing the English Channel. Parma was uneasy about mounting such an invasion without any possibility of surprise. The appointed commander of the Armada was the highly experienced √Ålvaro de Baz√°n, Marquis of Santa Cruz, but he died in February 1588, and the Duke of Medina Sidonia, a high-born courtier, took his place. While a competent soldier and distinguished administrator, Medina Sidonia had no naval experience. He wrote to Philip expressing grave doubts about the planned campaign, but his message was prevented from reaching the King by courtiers on the grounds that God would ensure the Armada's success. Execution Route taken by the Spanish Armada Prior to the undertaking, Pope Sixtus V allowed Philip II of Spain to collect crusade taxes and granted his men indulgences. The blessing of the Armada's banner on 25 April 1588 was similar to the ceremony used prior to the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. On 28 May 1588, the Armada set sail from Lisbon and headed for the English Channel. The fleet was composed of 130 ships, 8,000 sailors and 18,000 soldiers, and bore 1,500 brass guns and 1,000 iron guns. The full body of the fleet took two days to leave port. It included 28 purpose-built warships, of which 20 were galleons, four were galleys and four were (Neapolitan) galleasses. The remaining heavy vessels were mostly armed carracks and hulks, along with 34 light ships.Garrett Mattingly, The Invincible Armada and Elizabethan England (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1963), pp. 12‚Äì13. In the Spanish Netherlands, 30,000 soldiersColin Martin, Geoffrey Parker,The Spanish Armada, Penguin Books, 1999, , p. 94, gives 30,500 and raised to 30,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry on p.96.

In all, 55,000 men were to have been mustered, a huge army for that time. On the day the Armada set sail, Elizabeth's ambassador in the Netherlands, Valentine Dale, met Parma's representatives in peace negotiations. The English made a vain effort to intercept the Armada in the Bay of Biscay. On 6 July, negotiations were abandoned and the English fleet stood prepared, if ill-supplied, at Plymouth, awaiting news of Spanish movements. The English fleet outnumbered that of the Spanish, 200 ships to 130,The Spanish Armada : Sir Francis Drake while the Spanish fleet outgunned that of the English. The Spanish available firepower was 50 percent more than that of the English.Colin Martin, Geoffrey Parker,The Spanish Armada, Penguin Books, 1999, , p. 185. The English fleet consisted of the 34 ships of the Royal Fleet, 21 of which were galleons of 200 to 400 tons, and 163 other ships, 30 of which were of 200 to 400 tons and carried up to 42 guns each. Twelve of the ships were privateers owned by Lord Howard of Effingham, Sir John Hawkins and Sir Francis Drake. Signal station built in 1588, above the Devon village of Culmstock, to warn when the Armada was sighted The Armada was delayed by bad weather. Storms in the Bay of Biscay forced four galleys and one galleon to turn back, and other ships had to put in for repairs, leaving only about 124 ships to actually make it to the English Channel. Nearly half the fleet were not built as warships and were used for duties such as scouting and dispatch work, or for carrying supplies, animals and troops. The fleet was sighted in England on 19 July when it appeared off the Lizard in Cornwall. The news was conveyed to London by a system of beacons that had been constructed all the way along the south coast. On 19 July, the English fleet was trapped in Plymouth Harbour by the incoming tide. The Spanish convened a council of war, where it was proposed to ride into the harbour on the tide and incapacitate the defending ships at anchor. From Plymouth Harbour the Spanish would attack England, but Philip II explicitly forbade Medina Sidonia from acting, leaving the Armada to sail on to the east and toward the Isle of Wight. As the tide turned, 55 English ships set out to confront the Armada from Plymouth under the command of Lord Howard of Effingham, with Sir Francis Drake as Vice Admiral. The rear admiral was Sir John Hawkins. =First actions (1588)= On 20 July, the English fleet was off Eddystone Rocks with the Armada upwind to the west. To execute its attack, the English tacked upwind of the Armada, thus gaining the weather gage, a significant advantage. At daybreak on 21 July, the English fleet engaged the Armada off Plymouth near the Eddystone rocks. The Armada was in a crescent-shaped defensive formation, convex toward the east. The galleons and great ships were concentrated in the centre and at the tips of the crescent's horns, giving cover to the transports and supply ships in between. Opposing them, the English were in two sections, with Drake to the north in with 11 ships, and Howard to the south in with the bulk of the fleet. Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham Given the Spanish advantage in close-quarter fighting, the English ships used their superior speed and manoeuvrability to keep beyond grappling range and bombarded the Spanish ships from a distance with cannon fire. The distance was too great for the manoeuvre to be effective and, at the end of the first day's fighting, neither fleet had lost a ship in action, although the Spanish carrack Rosario and galleon San Salvador were abandoned after they collided. When night fell, Francis Drake turned his ship back to loot the abandoned Spanish ships, capturing supplies of much-needed gunpowder and gold. Drake had been guiding the English fleet by means of a lantern, which he snuffed out to slip away from the Spanish ships, causing the rest of his fleet to become scattered and disarrayed by dawn. It took a day for the English fleet to regroup and the Armada gained a day's grace.Colin Martin, Geoffrey Parker,The Spanish Armada, Penguin Books, 1999, , p. 153. The English ships again used their superior speed and manoeuvrability to catch up with the Spanish fleet after a day of sailing. The English fleet and the Armada engaged once more on 23 July, off Portland. A change of wind gave the Spanish the weather gage, and they sought to close with the English, but were foiled by the smaller ships' greater manoeuvrability. At one point, Howard formed his ships into a line of battle to attack at close range, bringing all his guns to bear, but he did not follow through with the manoeuvre and little was achieved. If the Armada could create a temporary base in the protected waters of the Solent, a strait separating the Isle of Wight from the English mainland, it could wait there for word from Parma's army. However, in a full-scale attack, the English fleet broke into four groups with Martin Frobisher of the ship Aid given command over a squadron, and Drake coming with a large force from the south. Medina Sidonia sent reinforcements south and ordered the Armada back to open sea to avoid The Owers shoals.Mcdermott. England and the Spanish Armada. p. 260 There were no other secure harbours further east along England's south coast, so the Armada was compelled to make for Calais, without being able to wait for word of Parma's army. On 27 July, the Armada anchored off Calais in a tightly packed defensive crescent formation, not far from Dunkirk, where Parma's army, reduced by disease to 16,000, was expected to be waiting, ready to join the fleet in barges sent from ports along the Flemish coast. Communication was more difficult than anticipated and word came too late that the Parma army had yet to be equipped with sufficient transport or to be assembled in the port, a process that would take at least six days. Medina Sidonia waited at anchor and Dunkirk was blockaded by a Dutch fleet of 30 flyboats under Lieutenant-Admiral Justinus of Nassau. Parma wanted the Armada to send its light pataches to drive away the Dutch, but Medina Sidonia would not send them because he feared he would need these ships for his own protection. There was no deep-water port where the fleet might shelter, always acknowledged as a major difficulty for the expedition, and the Spanish found themselves vulnerable as night drew on. English fireships are launched at the Spanish armada off Calais The Dutch flyboats mainly operated in the shallow waters off Zeeland and Flanders where larger warships with a deeper draught, like the Spanish and English galleons, could not safely enter. The Dutch enjoyed an unchallenged naval advantage in these waters, even though their navy was inferior in naval armament. An essential element of the plan of invasion, as it was eventually implemented, was the transportation of a large part of Parma's army of Flanders as the main invasion force in unarmed barges across the English Channel. These barges would be protected by the large ships of the Armada. However, to get to the Armada, they would have to cross the zone dominated by the Dutch navy, where the Armada could not go. This problem seems to have been overlooked by the Spanish planners, but it was insurmountable. Because of this obstacle, England never was in any real danger, at least from the Duke of Parma and the Army of Flanders. Because of the eventual English victory at sea, the Army of Flanders escaped the drowning death Justinus had in mind for them. (1991) \\"Of Providence and Protestant Winds: the Spanish Armada of 1588 and the Dutch armada of 1688\\", in: The Anglo-Dutch moment. Essays on the Glorious Revolution and its world impact. Cambridge U.P., ; pp. 349‚Äì51 At midnight on 28 July, the English set alight eight fireships, sacrificing regular warships by filling them with pitch, brimstone, gunpowder and tar, and cast them downwind among the closely anchored vessels of the Armada. The Spanish feared that these uncommonly large fireships were \\"hellburners\\", . specialised fireships filled with large gunpowder charges that had been used to deadly effect at the Siege of Antwerp. Two were intercepted and towed away, but the remainder bore down on the fleet. Medina Sidonia's flagship and the principal warships held their positions, but the rest of the fleet cut their anchor cables and scattered in confusion. No Spanish ships were burnt, but the crescent formation had been broken, and the fleet now found itself too far leeward of Calais in the rising southwesterly wind to recover its position. The English closed in for battle. =Battle of Gravelines= Sir Francis Drake in 1591 The small port of Gravelines was part of Flanders in the Spanish Netherlands close to the border with France, and the closest Spanish territory to England. Medina Sidonia tried to regather his fleet there and was reluctant to sail further east, knowing the danger from the shoals off Flanders, from which his Dutch enemies had removed the sea marks. The English learned of the Armada's weaknesses during the skirmishes in the English Channel and concluded it was necessary to close to within to penetrate the oak hulls of the Spanish ships. They had spent most of their gunpowder in the first engagements and had, after the Isle of Wight, been forced to conserve their heavy shot and powder for a final attack near Gravelines. During all the engagements, the Spanish heavy guns could not easily be reloaded because of their close spacing and the quantities of supplies stowed between decks, as Francis Drake had discovered on capturing the damaged Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario in the channel. Instead, the gunners fired once and then transferred to their main task, which was to board enemy ships as had been the practice in naval warfare at the time. Evidence from Armada wrecks in Ireland shows that much of the fleet's ammunition was never spent.Colin Martin, Geoffrey Parker, The Spanish Armada, Penguin Books, 1999, , pp. 189‚Äì90 Its determination to fight by boarding, rather than employing cannon fire at a distance, proved a weakness for the Spanish. The manoeuvre had been effective in the battles of Lepanto and Ponta Delgada (1582), but the English were aware of it and sought to avoid it by keeping their distance. With its superior manoeuvrability, the English fleet provoked Spanish fire while staying out of range. The English then closed, firing damaging broadsides into the enemy ships, which enabled them to maintain a windward position, so the heeling Armada hulls were exposed to damage below the water line when they changed course later. Many of the Spanish gunners were killed or wounded by the English broadsides, and the task of manning the cannon often fell to the regular foot soldiers who did not know how to operate them. The ships were close enough for sailors on the upper decks of the English and Spanish ships to exchange musket fire. After eight hours, the English ships began to run out of ammunition, and some gunners began loading objects such as chains into cannons. Around 4 p.m., the English fired their last shots and pulled back.Battlefield Britain: Episode 4, the Spanish Armada Five Spanish ships were lost. The galleass San Lorenzo, flagship of Don Hugo de Moncada, ran aground at Calais and was taken by Howard after fighting between the crew, galley slaves, English, and the French. The galleons San Mateo and San Felipe drifted away in a sinking condition, ran aground on the island of Walcheren the next day and were taken by the Dutch. One carrack ran aground near Blankenberge and another foundered. Many other Spanish ships were severely damaged, especially the Portuguese and some Spanish Atlantic-class galleons, including some Neapolitan galleys, which bore the brunt of the fighting during the early hours of the battle. The Spanish plan to join with Parma's army had been defeated. = Elizabeth's Tilbury speech = Because of the threat of invasion from the Netherlands, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester assembled a force of 4,000 militia at West Tilbury, Essex, to defend the Thames Estuary against any incursion up-river toward London. Because the result of the English fireship attack and the sea battle of Gravelines had not yet reached England, on 8 August (18 August New Style), Elizabeth went to Tilbury to review her forces, arriving on horseback in ceremonial armour to imply to the militia she was prepared to lead them in the ensuing battle. She gave to them her royal address, which survives in at least six slightly different versions.John Guy (2016). . Elizabeth: The Forgotten Years. Viking. p. 119. One version is as follows:Elizabeth I of England, the Armada portrait > My loving people, we have been persuaded by some that are careful of our > safety, to take heed how we commit ourselves to armed multitudes for fear of > treachery; but, I do assure you, I do not desire to live to distrust my > faithful and loving people. Let tyrants fear, I have always so behaved > myself, that under God I have placed my chiefest strength and safeguard in > the loyal hearts and goodwill of my subjects; and, therefore, I am come > amongst you as you see at this time, not for my recreation and disport, but > being resolved, in the midst and heat of battle, to live or die amongst you > all ‚Äì to lay down for my God, and for my kingdoms, and for my people, my > honour and my blood even in the dust.

Third ed. New York: Pearson Longman, 2006. After the victory, typhus swept the English ships, beginning among the 500-strong crew of the Elizabeth Jonas and killing many mariners. The sailors were not paid for their service and many died of the disease and starvation after landing at Margate. =Return to Spain= The Spanish Armada off the English coast On the day after the battle of Gravelines, the disorganised and unmanoeuvrable Spanish fleet was at risk of running on to the sands of Zeeland due to the westerly component in the wind. Luckily for the Armada, the wind then changed to the south, enabling the fleet to sail north. The English ships under Howard pursued to prevent any landing on English soil, although by this time his ships were almost out of shot. On 2 August, Howard called a halt to the pursuit at about the latitude of the Firth of Forth off Scotland. The only option left to the Spanish ships was to return to Spain by sailing round the north of Scotland and home via the Atlantic or the Irish sea. The Spanish ships were beginning to show wear from the long voyage and some were kept together by having their damaged hulls strengthened with cables. Supplies of food and water ran short. The intention would have been to keep to the west of the coast of Scotland and Ireland in the relative safety of the open sea. There being no way of accurately measuring longitude, the Spanish were not aware that the Gulf Stream was carrying them north and east as they tried to move west and they eventually turned south much closer to the coast than they thought. Off Scotland and Ireland, the fleet ran into a series of powerful westerly winds which drove many of the damaged ships further toward the lee shore. Because so many anchors had been abandoned during the escape from the English fireships off Calais, many of the ships were incapable of securing shelter as the fleet reached the coast of Ireland and were driven onto the rocks and local inhabitants looted the ships. The late 16th century and especially 1588 was marked by unusually strong North Atlantic storms, perhaps associated with a high accumulation of polar ice off the coast of Greenland, a characteristic phenomenon of the \\"Little Ice Age\\".Brian Fagan, The Little Ice Age: How Climate Made History 1300‚Äì1850, New York: Basic Books, 2000 More ships and sailors were lost to cold and stormy weather than in direct combat. About 5,000 men died by drowning, starvation and slaughter by local inhabitants after their ships were driven ashore on the west coast of Scotland and Ireland.. The English Lord Deputy ordered the English soldiers in Ireland to kill Spanish prisoners, which was done on several occasions instead of asking for ransom as was common during that period. Reports of the passage of the remnants of the Spanish Armada around Ireland abound with onerous accounts of hardships and survival.Winston S. Churchill, \\"The New World\\", vol. 3 of A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, (1956) Dodd, Mead & Co., New York, p. 130. The Spanish Barn in Torquay held 397 Spanish prisoners of war A plaque in the Spanish Barn In the end, 67 ships and fewer than 10,000 men survived.\\"In the end as many as two-thirds of the armada's original complement of 30,000 died and for every one killed in battle or perishing of their wounds another six or eight died due to (non-combat losses)\\", Hanson p. 563 Many of the men were near death from disease, as the conditions were very cramped and most of the ships ran out of food and water. Some were captured and imprisoned by the English in what was later called the \\"Spanish Barn\\" in Torquay on the south coast of England. More Armada survivors later died in Spain or on hospital ships in Spanish harbours from diseases contracted during the voyage. It was reported that when Philip II learned of the result of the expedition, he declared, \\"I sent the Armada against men, not God's winds and waves\\".SparkNotes: Queen Elisabeth ‚Äì Against the Spanish Armada Aftermath In England, a medal was struck with the inscription \\"Flavit Jehovah et Dissipati Sunt\\", which translates as \\"Jehovah blew with His winds, and they were scattered\\". Armada Medal, bearing the inscription Flavit Jehovah et Dissipati Sunt The wind that scattered the Armada has been called the Protestant Wind, a phrase also used for later navy attacks favourable to the Protestant cause that were helped by the wind.

The failure of the expedition depleted the financial resources of England's treasury, which had been carefully restored during the long reign of Elizabeth I. During the course of the war the Spanish failed to gain control of the English Channel, or stop the English intervention in Flanders or English privateer transatlantic raids. Although substantially weaker than the great armada sent in 1588, two more armadas were sent by Spain in 1596 and 1597, but both were once more scattered by storms. Nevertheless, through Philip II's naval revival the English and Dutch ultimately failed to disrupt the various fleets of the Indies despite the great number of military personnel mobilised every year. Thus, Spain remained the predominant power in Europe for several decades.J. H. Elliott. La Europa dividida (1559‚Äì1598) (Editorial Critica, 2002). p.333 The conflict wound down with diminishing military actions until a peace was agreed between the two powers on the signing of the Treaty of London in 1604. Technological revolution The defeat of the Spanish Armada vindicated the English strategy and caused a revolution in naval tactics, taking advantage of the wind (the \\"weather gage\\") and line-to-line cannon fire from windward, which exposed the opponent ship's hull and rudder as targets. Also instilled was the use of naval cannon to damage enemy ships without the need to board. Until then, the cannon had played a supporting role to the main tactic of ramming and boarding enemy ships. Most military historians hold that the battle of Gravelines reflected a lasting shift in the balance of naval power in favour of the English, in part because of the gap in naval technology and cannon armament which continued into the next century.Aubrey N. Newman, David T. Johnson, P.M. Jones (1985) The Eighteenth Century Annual Bulletin of Historical Literature 69 (1), 93‚Äì109 . In the words of Geoffrey Parker, by 1588, \\"the capital ships of the Elizabethan navy constituted the most powerful battlefleet afloat anywhere in the world\\".Geoffrey Parker, 'The Dreadnought Revolution of Tudor England', Mariner's Mirror, 82 (1996): 273. The English navy yards were leaders in technical innovation and the captains devised new battle formations and tactics. The sleeker and more manoeuvrable full-rigged ship, amply cannoned, was one of the greatest advances of the century and permanently transformed naval warfare. English shipwrights introduced designs in 1573, first demonstrated in , that allowed the ships to sail faster, manoeuvre better and carry many and heavier guns.Geoffrey Parker, \\"The 'Dreadnought' Revolution of Tudor England\\", Mariner's Mirror, Aug 1996, Vol. 82, Issue 3, pp. 269‚Äì300 Whereas before warships had tried to grapple with each other so soldiers could board the enemy ship, now they more often stood off and fired broadsides that could sink the vessel. Superior English ships and seamanship had foiled the invasion. The English also took advantage of Spain's complex strategy that required coordination between the invasion fleet and the Spanish army on shore. The poor design of the Spanish cannon meant they were much slower in reloading in a close-range battle, allowing the English to take control. Spain still had numerically larger fleets but England was catching up.Geoffrey Parker, \\"Why the Armada Failed\\", History Today, May 1988, Vol. 38 Issue 5, pp. 26‚Äì33 Legacy Day seven of the battle with the Armada, 7 August 1588, by Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom, 1601 In England, the boost to national pride from the defeat of the Spanish invasion attempt lasted for years and Elizabeth's legend persisted and grew long after her death. Repulsing the Spanish naval force may have given heart to the Protestant cause across Europe and the belief that God was behind the Protestants.Richard Holmes 2001, p. 858: \\"The 1588 campaign was a major English propaganda victory, but in strategic terms it was essentially indecisive\\" This was shown by the striking of commemorative medals that bore variations on the inscription, \\"1588. Flavit Jehovah et Dissipati Sunt\\" ‚Äì with \\"Jehovah\\" in Hebrew letters (\\"God blew, and they are scattered\\"), or He blew with His winds, and they were scattered. There were also more lighthearted medals struck, such as the one with the play on the words of Julius Caesar: Venit, Vidit, Fugit (he came, he saw, he fled). The victory was acclaimed by the English as their greatest since Agincourt. The memory of the victory over the Armada was evoked during both the Napoleonic Wars and the Second World War, when Britain again faced a substantial danger of foreign invasion. The Armada Memorial in Plymouth was constructed in 1888 to celebrate the tercentenary of the defeat of the Spanish Armada. Historiography Knerr (1989) has reviewed the main trends in historiography over five centuries.Douglas Knerr, \\"Through the \\"Golden Mist\\": a Brief Overview of Armada Historiography.\\" American Neptune 1989 49(1): 5‚Äì13. For 150 years writers relied heavily on Petruccio Ubaldini's A Discourse Concernye the Spanish Fleete Invadinye Englande (1590), which argued that God decisively favoured the Protestant cause. William Camden (1551‚Äì1623) pointed in addition to elements of English nationalism and the private enterprise of the sea dogs. He also emphasized that the Duke of Medina Sidonia was an incompetent seaman. David Hume (1711‚Äì1776) praised the leadership of Queen Elizabeth. However the Whig historians, led by James A. Froude (1818‚Äì1894), rejected Hume's interpretation and argued that Elizabeth was vacillating and almost lost the conflict by her unwillingness to previously spend enough to maintain and supply the Royal Navy's fleet of ships. Scientific modern historiography came of age with the publication of two volumes of primary documents by John K. Laughton in 1894. This enabled the leading naval scholar of the day Julian Corbett (1854‚Äì1922) to reject the Whig views and turn attention to the professionalization of the Royal Navy as a critical factor. Twentieth-century historians have focused on technical issues, such as the comparative power of English and Spanish naval guns and the degree of naval battle tactics credit due Francis Drake and Charles Howard. Inclement weather in the English Channel and on the oceans at the time has always been cited as a major factor to the outcome.

FEPCA provided guidelines to achieve pay comparability between Federal and non-Federal jobs. FEPCA was enacted as Section 529 of the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act, 1991 (Public Law 101-509, signed into law on 5 November 1990). FEPCA Provisions The most far reaching provisions of the Act were to change the way pay is set for the General Schedule and to maintain comparability by locality. It also called for establishment of the following special pay plans: Senior Level (SL) employees (non-supervisory and non- managerial employees classified above grade 15 of the General Schedule), administrative law judges (AL), members of the Boards of Contract Appeals (CA), certain law enforcement officers, employees in the Senior Biomedical Service, and police of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the United States Mint. FEPCA also authorized recruitment and relocation bonuses and retention allowances in special situations as well. A major feature of the Act, locality pay, is discussed below. Locality Pay FEPCA provides for a two-part annual pay adjustment for General Schedule workers: an across-the- board pay adjustment and a locality pay adjustment that varies by pay locality. Locality pay may be extended by Executive Order to other pay plans outside the General Schedule. Employees receiving special rates for hard-to- fill positions receive the higher of their special salary rate or locality pay. Implementation of FEPCA A common misconception is that the locality adjustments are determined according to cost of living fluctuations and other regional considerations.Stewart Liff, Managing Your Government Career: Success Strategies That Work, AMACOM, New York, (2009), In fact, the adjustments are determined according to the cost of employment in a given area as measured by the Department of Labor's Employment Cost Index (ECI), which does not necessarily correlate to the better-known Consumer Price Index that tracks consumer prices. Both Republican and Democratic administrations have complained about the methodology used to compute locality adjustments and the projected cost of closing the pay gap (as determined by FEPCA) between Federal salaries and those in the private sector. As a result, FEPCA has never been fully implemented. Although FEPCA provides for an automatic formula to determine the annual pay raise, this formula has been ignored due to the cost of implementation. The President has authority under FEPCA to submit an \\"alternative\\" pay plan with a lower raise than that called for by the FEPCA formula (or none at all) \\"if because of national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare\\" [5 U.S.C. ¬ß5303(b)(1)]. In reality, the final pay raise has been decided by Congress, which may authorize higher or lower increases than what were originally requested by the President in his annual budget submissions.

Some are essentially identical to basketball, with only minor rules changes, while others are more distant and arguably not simple variations but distinct games. Other variations include children's games, contests or activities intended to help the player practice or reinforce skills, which may or may not have a competitive aspect. Most of the variations are played in informal settings, without the presence of referees or other officials and sometimes without strict adherence to official game rules. Different roster sizes A competitive game of basketball can be played with as few as the team of 2-on-2, 3-on-3, 4-on-4, or 5-on-5. Each team's roster is typically the same size, but an odd number of players may force one team to play with one less player. Sometimes the odd player will be designated as a \\"switch\\" player, so that the offensive team always has the extra player. Roster sizes above five players per team are uncommon, even in informal games, as the court generally becomes too crowded to allow movement and space to develop between players. Six-on-six basketball was a form of basketball played in the twentieth century mainly among high school girls. Three-on-three basketball remains competitively played by amateurs. More recently, FIBA has created a formalized version of three-on-three, originally known as FIBA 33 and now called 3x3. Other games using basketball skills and equipment =Twenty-one= Half-court in Triangle Lake, Oregon \\"Twenty-one\\" is a game that can be played with two or more players. Each player has their own score, with the winner being the first to reach 21 points. No player has any teammates at any time in the game. The player with the ball may shoot at any time, and may collect his own rebound and shoot again. Whenever a basket is scored, that player receives two points and goes to the free throw line, where each made free throw tacks on another one point to their score. The player is allowed to shoot free throws until he misses, or until he has made 3 in a row, at which point the ball is put back in play, and the sequence starts again. Twenty-one is nearly always played in a half court game. More distantly related games Spin-offs from basketball that are now separate sports include: =Ringball= Ringball is a traditional South African sport that stems from basketball and has been played since 1907. The sport is now promoted in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, India, and Mauritius to establish Ringball as an international sport. =Korfball= Korfball started in the Netherlands and is now played worldwide. Korfball (Dutch: Korfbal) is a mixed gender team ball game, similar to mixed netball and basketball. =Netball= Netball is a limited-contact team sport in which two teams of seven try to score points against one another by placing a ball through a high hoop. Netball was formerly called \\"women's basketball\\" but now includes men's teams as well. =Slamball= Slamball is full-contact basketball, with trampolines. Points are scored by playing the ball through the net, as in basketball, though the point-scoring rules are modified. The main differences from the parent sport is the court; below the padded basketball rim and backboard are four trampolines set into the floor which serve to propel players to great heights for slam dunks. The rules also permit some physical contact between the members of the four-player teams. Basketball variations =H-O-R-S-E= The game of H-O-R-S-‚Äå‚ÄåE is played by 2 or more players. The order of turns is established before the game starts. The player whose turn is first is given control, which means they must attempt to make a basket in a particular way of their choosing, explaining to the other players beforehand what the requirements of the shot are. If that player is successful, every subsequent player must attempt that same shot according to its requirements. If a player fails to duplicate the shot, they acquire a letter, starting with H and moving rightward through the word \\"Horse\\". After all players have made an attempt, control moves to the next player, and the game continues on in this fashion. If a player who has control misses their shot, there is no letter penalty and control moves to the next player. Whenever any player has all of the letters, they are eliminated from the game. The last person in the game is declared the winner. =Airball= This game can be played by as many players as needed. The first shooting line is the foul line. Each player has an order for when it is their turn to shoot. The first shooter takes their shot from the foul line. If they miss the ring and backboard or Airball on the shot, then they are eliminated, and this is applied to any shot by any player during the game. If they miss the shot but hit either the ring or backboard then the next player in line must retrieve the ball after it has bounced once but before it bounces twice, then take the shot from wherever they retrieved the ball. If the ball bounces twice, the player is eliminated. If the shot is made, then the shooter must retrieve the ball before it bounces twice, they then take another shot, if they make 3 shots in a row, then they are able to eliminate another player by hitting them with the ball. The remaining players are able to run away from the shooter but must stop and remain frozen, when the shooter has retrieved the ball after the 3 shot and yelled \\"STOP\\". The shooter must then take 7 steps and throw the ball from wherever they have reached. Any player who is touched by the ball is then eliminated. The game is then restarted from the Free Throw line from the next player in line. The game is continued until there is only one player not eliminated. Last player standing is the winner. Some special techniques used are to start running away from the ring once a shooter has made two shots to ensure that if a 3rd is made, it is more difficult to hit them with the ball. The shooter can negate this by purposefully missing the 3rd shot in the hope the next shooter is too far away to retrieve it. Another technique is to throw the ball very hard at the ring to enable a difficult return for the next shooter. =Fives= This game is played by 2 or more players. The shooting line is typically the top of the key, but can be moved to the foul line for younger players. Before the game starts, select an order of play. All players (except the one shooting) should remain behind the shooting line, out of the line of play. The first player shoots from the shooting line. If the shot is missed, the player must retrieve the rebound, and shoot from the spot that the rebound was retrieved. The other players are not permitted to interfere with either the ball or the player. The player continues to shoot until a basket is made, to a maximum of 5 shots. When the first player has made the shot, the next player begins shooting, again from the shooting line. This player must make the basket in the same number, or fewer shots than the preceding shooter. The next player then shoots, again from the shooting line and must make the basket in the same number, or fewer shots than the player that immediately preceded him\\\\her in shooting. If a player takes more shots than the player that immediately preceded him\\\\her, a point is added to that player's score. Additionally, if a player is unable to make a basket in 5 shots or less, another point is added to that player's score. When a player reaches 5 points, he\\\\she is eliminated from the game. When a player is eliminated from the game, the player immediately following that player has up to 5 shots on his\\\\her turn. The game continues until all but one player has been eliminated. The last player standing is the winner. =In and Out= In and Out is a game that requires more than three players. One player starts the game by shooting from the free throw line. If they make two baskets in a row, they can eliminate a player of their choosing. If they miss their shot, they must try to rebound the ball, and the person closest to the ball where it lands are the two people 'in play'. Whoever gets to the ball first is the attacker and the other is the defender. If the attacker makes a basket, the defender is eliminated. There are always two people that are considered 'in play'. [The other nearby players should maintain relatively still so as not to interfere] The primary player is usually the last person to shoot the ball, and the secondary player is the closest moving person to the ball. (If all players stayed frozen, whoever is closest to where the ball landed is automatically 'in play') Whoever then gets the ball is considered the primary player, aka the attacker, and the secondary player is the defender. However, during play, if another person is closer and makes a move for the ball, that person is now 'in play': Again, whoever gets the ball is the primary, and the last person that moved for the ball is now the secondary. If you are eliminated, you stand off the court, at the foot of the basket, but you can still get back into the game. If a player shoots an airball, you can get back in the game if you are the one to catch it before it touches the ground. You then become the attacker and the person who made the airball shot is the defender. (For this rule, you do have to remain off the court when catching the airball so as not to be actively interfering in the game). The game is over when all but one player has been eliminated. The last player standing is the winner. additional common rule: * If a player eliminates a certain number of people by making baskets from the free throw line (a common number is five), then they must then start shooting from the top of the key. * The last player either cannot be eliminated with a free throw or must be eliminated with an extra shot to end the game, either from the top of the key or from the half court line. =Around the World= Around the World (sometimes called Around the Key) is a basketball variant played by 2 or more players, who have all agreed upon a turn order. The game requires a sequence of shooting positions to be decided upon. The object is to be the first player to make a shot from all positions. When a player makes a successful shot from the final position, the game enters the final stage. Some play such that this player is declared the winner. Others play such that those players who have yet to act on the turn get a chance to tie, which cancels any advantage of going first. In theory, the shooting positions are arbitrary; in practice, they are most commonly ordered along the 3-point line in equal intervals starting from one of the sides of the basket and including the straight-on center shot (e.g., 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 degrees along the 3-point line with 90 being the center). This 180-degree semi-circular path is the inspiration for the game's name. Other common positions are around the key or even under the basket. Making a shot from a position allows a player to advance to the next position. The rules are very flexible but usually a player keeps advancing until a missed shot. The consequences of missing a shot may vary. Sometimes the game is played such that a missed shot requires the player to start over at the first position. Under this rule, the game may also include another rule that allows a player to \\"save\\" their position, and pass the ball to the next player. It is probably most common, however, to play such that each player continues until a missed shot. At this point a player may save his position or elect to take another \\"chance\\" shot. If the chance shot is made, the player advances as normal. If it misses, the player's turn ends and they suffer some penalty, perhaps regressing a position or even starting over. There are a multitude of ways the game can be modified. Other variations include: shooting with the off arm, shooting with alternating arms, or using the backboard on every shot (except those directly to the side of the basket). This game can also be played alone as shooting training. =Knockout= Knockout, sometimes called Lightning, Bump, Gotcha, Bumpout, Tornado, or Killer is played by 2 or more players and requires 2 basketballs. All players line up behind the selected shooting point, typically the center of the free throw line or the top of the key. The first player in line shoots. If they miss, they rebound the ball and continues shooting until they make a goal. Once the first player throws the ball for his first attempt, the second player may make his first attempt. The goal of the first player is to make a basket before the second player does. If so, the first player recovers the ball and passes it to the next player in line. The goal of the second player is to make a basket before the first player does. If so, the first player is out and play stops until both balls have been returned to the players in line. Once the new first and second players each have a ball, play resumes. This pattern follows until all players have been eliminated except one, who is declared the winner. Typically a new game then starts with everyone lining up at the same shooting point according to the order they were eliminated, with the winner in the front of the line and the first person eliminated in the back of the line. Double dribbling and out-of-bounds are not enforced. Players are required to dribble, though traveling is not heavily monitored. It is common for players to bump an opponent's ball further away from the basket, but some players discourage this behavior or place limits on it. It is also common for a player to throw his ball up through the bottom of the hoop to knock the opponent's ball out and away. Again, some players consider this to be poor sportsmanship. Soft-tossing the ball so a player can pick it up and shoot closer to the basket is also considered cheating. Whenever someone is guilty of poor sportsmanship or cheats, it is said that they have to shoot a second time. Additional common rules: * The winner is allowed to pick where the new shooting point is. * The winner of the previous game must go 1st or 2nd in the next game, thus putting him/her at risk for the former or in safety for the latter. * When a player is eliminated, any other players that player previously eliminated return to play at the end of the line. For example: Alice, Bob, Cami, Dan and Edgar are playing. Dan eliminates Cami and Bob. Later, Edgar eliminates Dan so Cami and Bob return to play at the end of the line. This variant is called Revenge. The logic for this version is that the winner must eliminate all other players in order to win. A game of revenge can take a long time to finish since any player can be eliminated and return to play any number of times. Some versions of revenge put a limit on how many times a player can return to play; i.e., once a player has been eliminated 5 times (for example), that player cannot return to play. * Forcing the second shooter to wait for the shot from the first shooter to touch or pass the rim or backboard before taking a first shot. * When a player is eliminated, there is a variation not to wait until both balls return to the line. As soon as the first ball is returned, the next player may shoot. =King of the Court= Another less common streetball variant, often referred to as \\"King of the Court\\", or \\"Boston\\", results in essentially a one-on-one or sometimes two-on- two tournament between any number of players. Each match is played following normal one-on-one rules, including violations (such as fouls and out-of- bounds) to just one point. The winner remains on the court and gets to take the ball out while the loser returns to the end of the line of players waiting to step on the court. The first player to win a set number of matches (usually 7 or 11) wins the game can only take one shot per turn.

Tikki Tikki Tembo. New York and Chicago: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1968. The book tells the story of a Chinese boy with a long name who falls into a well. It is a sort of origin myth about why Chinese names are so short today. Plot Tikki Tikki Tembo is set in ancient China and invents an ancient Chinese custom whereby parents honor their first-born sons with long, elaborate names that everyone is obliged to say completelyno nicknames, no shortening of any kindwhile second- born sons are typically given short, unimportant names. A boy named Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo (\\"The Most Wonderful Thing in the Whole Wide World\\") and his little brother Chang (\\"Little or Nothing\\") are playing very close to a well at their house that their mother has warned them to avoid. Chang falls in the well and his older brother runs to their mother and tells her Chang has fallen down the well. Their mother tells him to get the Old Man with the Ladder. He goes and tells the Old Man. Chang is rescued and then recovers quickly. Some time later, the boys are again playing near the well. This time, the older brother falls in. Chang runs to their mother and tries to tell her that \\"Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo- chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo has fallen into the well.\\" At first she cannot hear him so he says it again. However, because Chang is out of breath from running he sputters and then mispronounces the name. His mother insists that he repeat the namebut with respect. He tries repeatedly until finally his mother tells Chang to get the Old Man with the Ladder. Chang goes to the Old Man with the Ladder. Initially, the old man does not respond because he is asleep. Further, when Chang tries to wake him up, the Old Man with the Ladderannoyedtries to fall back asleep. After Chang breathlessly repeats his brother's predicament the Old Man goes with Chang to save his brother from the well. They get Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo from the well, but because of the long time he was in the well, it takes longer for him to recover. The end of the story says that this is why the Chinese have short names. Reception The book received accolades upon publication.

It was primarily developed by series creator and developer Square Enix, which also acted as publisher for all titles. While featuring various worlds and different characters, each Fabula Nova Crystallis game is ultimately based on and expands upon a common mythos focusing on important crystals tied to deities. The level of connection to the mythos varies between each title. The series title translates from Latin as 'The New Tale of the Crystal'. Each development team was given the freedom to adapt the mythos to fit the context of a game's story. The series, originally announced in 2006 as Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII, currently consists of seven games across multiple platforms. Final Fantasy XIII, designed as the series' flagship title, was released in 2009. The creative forces behind the series include many developers from previous Final Fantasy titles, including Shinji Hashimoto and Motomu Toriyama. The mythos was conceived and written by Kazushige Nojima. The first games announced for the series were Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XV (as Versus XIII), and Final Fantasy Type-0 (as Agito XIII). All three games went through delays. After Final Fantasy XIII and Type-0s releases, their respective teams used ideas and concepts from development to create additional games. For later games, other studios have been brought in to help with aspects of development. Final Fantasy XV was distanced from the series brand for marketing purposes, though it retains thematic connections. Seven titles have been released as of 2016. The series is complemented by works in related media, including companion books, novelizations, and manga. Final Fantasy XV notably expanded into a multimedia project, spawning a feature film and an original animated webseries. Individual games have generally received a positive reception, although opinions have been more mixed over various aspects of the three Final Fantasy XIII games. Reception of the mythos' use in the released games has also been mixed: while some critics called it confusing or too similar to the lore of the main series, others were impressed by its scope and use. Retrospective opinions on the series have also been mixed.  Titles  Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy currently consists of seven titles across multiple platforms, including sequels and spin-offs of the original entries. The entries in the Fabula Nova Crystallis series share the same mythology, interpreted differently and referred to in varying degrees for each of the game worlds. * Final Fantasy XIII, the thirteenth core Final Fantasy game and the first title in the series. First released in Japan as a PlayStation 3 exclusive in December 2009, it was released on the PlayStation3 and Xbox 360 in North America and Europe in March 2010. A version of the game for the Xbox 360, Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits International, was released in Japan in December 2010. XIII was released as a digital download for Microsoft Windows in October 2014. The game was designed to be a story-driven single-player role-playing game (RPG), with a battle system designed to emulate the cinematic battles seen in the film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. * Final Fantasy Type-0 (originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII) was released in October 2011 in Japan for the PlayStation Portable. A high-definition remaster for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Final Fantasy Type-0 HD, was released worldwide in March 2015. The original game is a real-time action RPG, featuring combat similar to Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, and a multiplayer option where online players can take control of characters during the majority of the game. Type-0 HD features updated graphics and changes to the gameplay, such as lower difficulty and the removal of multiplayer. * Final Fantasy XIII-2, a direct sequel to XIII, was released in December 2011 in Japan, and in January and February, 2012 in North America and Europe respectively for PS3 and 360. In response to criticism the company received from critics and fans about XIIIs linear structure, XIII-2 was designed to be a more traditional role-playing game, with explorable towns, a nonlinear story structure, mini- games and other traditional features. * Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, a sequel to XIII and XIII-2, was released in November 2013 in Japan, and February 2014 in North America and Europe for PS3 and 360. It concludes both the story of the main character Lightning and the Final Fantasy XIII story arc. Lightning Returns blends several traditional role-playing features, such as shops, quests and an explorable open world, with an action-oriented combat system. * Final Fantasy Agito, a companion title set in Type-0s world, was released in May 2014 in Japan on Android and iOS devices. Service ended in November 2015. Ports for the PlayStation Vita and Microsoft Windows were also in development, but have since been cancelled. Agito was an episodic game featuring single-player and multi-player modes, and a social system where the player's standing with non-playable characters advances their rank in-game. * Final Fantasy XV (originally known as Final Fantasy Versus XIII), the fifteenth core Final Fantasy title, was announced in the same year as XIII and Type-0, and was released worldwide on November 29, 2016 for PS4 and Xbox One. The game is an action role-playing game with a battle system similar to those from the Kingdom Hearts series and Type-0. The game uses open world exploration using both a vehicle and chocobos, along with a camping mechanic linked to gaining experience levels. Its development cycle, beginning in 2006, lasted ten years. The game was supported by downloadable content (DLC) between 2017 and 2019. * Final Fantasy Awakening, a replacement for Agito, was developed for Android and iOS. The gameplay features cooperative multiplayer similar to the original multiplayer elements of Type-0, along with hack-and- slash gameplay. The game released in December 2016 in China, and in February 2018 in North America. The English version closed in 2019 due to server changes, while the game as a whole was shut down in 2020 with the expiry of the licensing deal. Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels have a strong connection to the mythos, making extensive use of its terminology and involving many of its deities. The universe of Final Fantasy Type-0 used the terminology and made minor reference to the mythos while focusing on the human side of events, although these references were added during later story development. While the mythos is still present in Final Fantasy XV, it was \\"disconnected\\" from the core framework, with specific terminology being removed and its emphasis reduced to become a background element for the world and story.  Themes  The universes of Final Fantasy XIII, Type-0 and Final Fantasy XV are unrelated to each other, though common elements and themes are present. The first is a common narrative theme of harmful interference by the mythos' deities in the affairs of humans, and those humans' choice of whether to accept or challenge the predetermined fates given to them. Tetsuya Nomura defined this theme as \\"a battle of the gods that lies behind each tale and gives it inspiration in a different way\\". Hajime Tabata later defined the theme as a tale of humans placing their lives at risk after being chosen by the crystal. The second common element is the structure of the Fabula Nova Crystallis universe, which is divided in two: the mortal world, where humans live, and the afterlife or . A recurring theme is subverting the series' traditional view of crystals, making them objects that brought both prosperity and tragedy by their influence. A common element not related to the mythos, themes or plots of the series is the use of Latin in the games' titles or worlds, often as key words to describing themes and story points: the series' title translates as 'The New Tale of the Crystal', 'Agito' roughly translates as \\"to put into motion\\", while 'Versus' translates as both \\"to turn around\\" and \\"against\\", which were described as representing key narrative concepts. 'Agito' was kept within the Final Fantasy Type-0 universe with both an in- universe concept and the title of its prequel. 'Versus' was used in early trailers for Final Fantasy XV after its re-reveal in 2013, carrying the tagline 'A World of the Versus Epic'. Commenting on the high use of Latin in Final Fantasy XV prior to its public name change, Nomura said he wanted a language that was no longer used on a daily basis and that people \\"won't be able to understand and yet appreciate\\", desiring a sense of general equality. = Mythology = In the mythology, the god seizes control of the mortal world by killing his mother, the creator goddess , who vanishes into the Unseen Realm. Believing that the mortality of the world is Mwynn's curse, Bhunivelze creates three new deities to search for the gate to the Unseen Realm so he can control both worlds. The first deity, , is tasked with terraforming the world; the second deity, , is discarded because of her resemblance to Mwynn; the third deity, , acts as his protector. Bhunivelze then enters a deep sleep, while Lindzei and Pulse carry out their missions. Distraught at being abandoned, Etro kills herself, and humans are born from her blood. Once in the Unseen Realm, Etro finds Mwynn being consumed by a force called chaos, which threatens to destroy reality. As Mwynn fades, she tasks Etro with protecting the balance between the worlds. Etro gives humans pieces of chaos that become their \\"hearts\\". Because humans held chaos within them, they maintained the balance through their death and reincarnation. Since then, humans have either worshiped or feared Pulse and Lindzei, and refer to Etro as the goddess of death. The mythos' deities hold similar roles in each game's setting, but are not the same characters in a narrative sense. A recurring race in the games are god-like beings created by Pulse and Lindzei to act as their servants in the mortal world. In the original mythos and the XIII games, the demigods are called fal'Cie . They take the form of crystal-powered mechanical beings in the XIII games. In the universe of Type-0, they are both semi-sentient crystals and humanoid beings living among the people. The fal'Cie have the ability to imbue chosen humans with magical powers and assign them a task to complete either willingly or unwillingly. Final Fantasy XIII and Type-0 refer to these people as l'Cie and the task given to them as a Focus. In the worlds of XIII and Type-0, there are two possible outcomes for l'Cie: once their Focus is fulfilled, they can go into 'crystal stasis', transforming into a crystal statue, and gain eternal life, but if they fail they become mindless crystalline monsters called . In Type-0, l'Cie are chosen by the crystal of their country, and given great power to fulfill their assigned Focus, but lose their memories if emotionally unstable. While not referred to as such using the original terminology, humans imbued with magic and burdened with a task exist in Final Fantasy XV, one of them being the main protagonist Noctis.  Production  = Creation = The concept for the Fabula Nova Crystallis series originated during late development on Final Fantasy X-2 and the original Kingdom Hearts. Discussing what to do once Final Fantasy XII was completed, Nomura, Shinji Hashimoto and Yoshinori Kitase decided to build upon the idea of multiple games connected by a single \\"central theme\\". Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima started writing the original mythology for the Fabula Nova Crystallis series in 2003, finishing it by February 2004. Nojima described his creation as the result of a wish to create something entirely new; a universe with its own mythos and legends. When he introduced the concept to other team members, they liked it and helped it grow. As with some of his other projects, Nojima incorporated themes of mythology due to his liking for and extensive research of Greek and Norse mythology. During his work, he received creative input from Kitase and Hashimoto, as well as Nomura, Tabata and Motomu Toriyama. Nojima wrote a series bible about the mythology, explaining concepts such as the fal'Cie and l'Cie and the feelings of the deities who created them. This bible became the basis for a video animated by Yusuke Naora's art team to showcase the mythos in 2011. None of the deities were depicted in human form in the video, as this would have undermined the developers' wishes for open interpretation by developers and players. The central concept for Fabula Nova Crystallis came from the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, a multimedia subseries featuring the world and characters of Final Fantasy VII. Whereas the common link in the Compilation was Final Fantasy VII, the team chose to use \\"the tale of new crystals\\" for the new series, with the mythos connecting the games rather than an overarching narrative. Another key idea behind the mythos was to ease the production of future Final Fantasy games by providing an established universe. The individual directors are allowed to freely interpret the base mythology when they create their games. When referring to this freedom, Tabata has compared the mythos and the concept behind it to Greek mythology; a mythos with common themes and deities, but featuring many unrelated stories. Toriyama based the story of Final Fantasy XIII around the mythos' deities and their direct relations to the world. Tabata and Nomura both focused on the human side of the story. Tabata chose to portray the divine elements from a historical standpoint in Type-0. Nomura created a modern-day setting similar to contemporary Earth in Final Fantasy XV, referring far less to the mythos' terminology. Nomura was also appointed as the main character designer for all entries in the subseries. In a 2007 interview, Hashimoto compared the planning of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series to film franchises such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings: an expansive brand on which to build multiple Final Fantasy titles planned in advance. The development of all games connected to the mythos was handled by Square Enix 1st Production Department. A trademark for Final Fantasy Haeresis XIII hinted at another entry, but the trademark expired in 2011 and the company did not renew. = Development = Final Fantasy XIII began development in February 2004. It began as a title for the PlayStation 2 under the codename \\"Colors World\\", however it was moved onto PlayStation3 after the positively received Crystal Tools engine demo in 2005 and the delayed release of Final Fantasy XII. The original titles in the series were Final Fantasy XIII and Versus XIII. Agito XIII was conceived later, when Tabata was looking for a new project after finishing Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII. Originally titled Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII, the three titles were announced at E3 2006 Final Fantasy XIII and Versus XIII were intended to form the core of the series, with future games being a \\"facet\\" of Final Fantasy XIII. Agito XIII and Versus XIII both began production in 2006. The subseries' title changed in 2011 when the \\"XIII\\" numeral was dropped as it \\"would have been an issue\\". XIII was developed by team members who had worked on Final Fantasy VII, VIII, X and X-2. It was first announced as a PS3 exclusive. Late in its development, Final Fantasy XIII changed from being a console exclusive when an Xbox 360 version was announced, significantly delaying its release. After the release of Final Fantasy XIII, the creators wanted to expand on the game's setting and tell more stories about the characters, so XIII-2 and Lightning Returns were developed. For these games, Japanese developer tri-Ace was brought in to help with the games' design and graphics. The three games and their respective tie- in media were referred to as the \\"Lightning Saga\\" by Square Enix staff after the games' central character. A port for Microsoft Windows was considered, but not followed up due to platform-specific concerns and the company's view of the video game market. Later, Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels would receive PC ports through Steam. While there was speculation that Fabula Nova Crystallis would end with Lightning Returns, Kitase repeatedly said there was still room for further titles beyond the XIII universe. Agito XIII was handled by staff from Before Crisis. The game was originally being developed as an episodic mobile game. By 2008, Agito XIII had been moved onto the PlayStation Portable, then later renamed Final Fantasy Type-0. The stated reason for the change of title was that Final Fantasy XIII and Type-0 shared little besides the core mythos. Type-0s western release was delayed due to the flagging PSP market in western territories. A high-definition port to the same platforms as Final Fantasy XV was co-developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, and was eventually announced for a western release. Tabata created Agito around his original ideas for Type-0 as a mobile title. Agito acted both as a prequel to Type-0 and as an alternate story set within its world. The game was co- developed by mobile game developer Tayutau K. K. Later, Chinese developer Perfect World were brought in to develop Awakening; it was the first Final Fantasy title licensed by Square Enix to an external company. Versus XIIIs development was headed by the team behind the console Kingdom Hearts games. Like XIII, the game was a PS3 exclusive. As early as 2007, Square Enix considered re-branding Versus XIII as a numbered entry in the main series due to the rapidly growing scale of the project. The game was eventually re- branded in 2011 as Final Fantasy XV. As part of its later marketing, Final Fantasy XV was deliberately distanced from the Fabula Nova Crystallis brand to remove the consequent limitation on their target audience, although lore and design elements were retained. The game was also moved fully onto eighth generation consoles and developed using the company's new Luminous Studio engine. The PS3 version was abandoned due to concerns about the console's continued viability. Final Fantasy XV eventually had help from multiple developers, including HexaDrive, XPEC Entertainment and Umbra. In contrast to Final Fantasy XIII, Tabata decided against creating any sequels to Final Fantasy XV, instead expanding the base game through DLC. The first season of DLC was well received, so a second season was commissioned. All but one of these later DLC episodes was cancelled in 2018 following the decision by the team to focus on a new intellectual property. = Related media = The games have been complemented and expanded upon through other media. For Final Fantasy XIII, a small book of short stories titled Final Fantasy XIII - Episode Zero was released, first through the game's website and then as a print release in December 2009. It shows events prior to the game's opening. A second novella, Episode i, was published via XIII-2s official website, bridging the narrative gap between XIII and XIII-2. Alongside XIII-2s Japanese release, a book detailing events not shown or described in the game titled Fragments Before was released in December 2011 including Episode i; this would be followed up by Fragments After, released in June 2012. Only Episode i has received an official English release. Lightning Returns was also set to receive a prequel novel by Benny Matsuyama alongside the game's Japanese release in November 2013, however this was later cancelled due to the author falling ill. A three-part novella exclusive to Famitsu Weekly magazine titled Final Fantasy XIII Reminiscence: tracer of memories was released across June and July 2014. It was written by Daisuke Watanabe, who handled the scripts for the XIII games, and takes place immediately after the ending of Lightning Returns. Reminiscence was later released online. Final Fantasy Type-0 received a manga adaptation illustrated by Takatoshi Shiozawa. It began publication in the November 2011 of Young Gangan and was collected into a single volume and released in April 2012. The manga was translated into English and released as part of the western collector's edition for Type-0 HD, available exclusively through Square Enix's online store. A second manga following one of the game's secondary characters, Final Fantasy Type-0 Side Story: Reaper of the Icy Blade, began serialization in May 2012. The latter manga was created by Shiozawa under Nomura's supervision. The manga ended in January 2014, with a bonus chapter released in February of the same year. It will be released in the west in July 2015, licensed by Yen Press. Two novels detailing an alternate version of Type-0, titled Final Fantasy Type-0: Change the World, were released in April and June 2012. Agito received another Change the World novel adaptation focusing on two of the game's supporting characters. Ultimania guides and companion books have been released for the majority of released games. Final Fantasy XV similarly had additional media released around it, forming a dedicated multimedia expansion dubbed the \\"Final Fantasy XV Universe\\". The majority of its content fleshed out the background for Final Fantasy XVs plot, which would have required multiple video games under normal circumstances. While comparing the Final Fantasy XV Universe to the overall structure of Fabula Nova Crystallis, the game's director defined it as an attempt to make the narrative of XV work in current times rather than attempting to \\"reinvent\\" the original concept. An anime produced by Square Enix and A-1 Pictures, Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV, details the backstories of the main cast and how they came to be journeying together. It is being distributed online through the months leading up to the game's release. A CGI feature film produced by the same team as Advent Children, Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV, was released in July 2016 in Japan and in August in America; it focuses on the main character's father Regis Lucis Caelum, alongside original characters. The cancelled DLC was turned into the novel Final Fantasy XV: The Dawn of the Future.  Reception  The Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos has received mixed reactions from gaming sites. Hardcore Gamers Brady Hale called the series \\"anything but ordinary\\" in the variety of games it featured. In an article concerning the 25th Anniversary event for the Final Fantasy series, Joystiq's Ben Gilbert called the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos \\"occasionally bizarre and often beautiful\\". In 2014, Jeremy Parish of USGamer said the series was \\"much ado about nothing\\", stating that since the games shared a large amount of themes and plot points with the main series, there seemed little reason for a distinction. TechnoBuffalo's Ron Duwell, in an article concerning a documentary video on Final Fantasy XV, called the series \\"overly ambitious\\", but felt that it was worth Fabula Nova Crystallis \\"[imploding] upon itself\\" if Final Fantasy XV fulfilled its promises. Kat Bailey, writing for USGamer as part of her review for Final Fantasy XV, said that series fans were ready for the subseries to come to an end with the game's release. RPG Site's Chelsi Laire called the subseries \\"a series of successes and failures, but mostly the latter\\" due to its troubled development, but hoped that the company would revisit the brand in the future. Speaking about the XIII games in particular, Parish suggested that their mixed reactions influenced the title changes of other games in the original series, giving the teams a chance to give those games more of their own identity. He also felt that the decision to expand the XIII storyline into multiple games \\"probably worked out just as well\\". The presentation of the mythos and its terms received mixed reactions in XIII, resulting in the production team toning down their use for XIII-2. Siliconera writer Spencer Yip, in his review of Lightning Returns, commented that the story and pace of the game was \\"muddled\\" by the mythos. In 2016, RPGFan writer Mike Salbato wrote a retrospective of the Final Fantasy XIII games and their version of Fabula Nova Crystallis: he felt that the lack of specific references to the mythos in XIII had harmed general comprehension, and that a reliance on foreknowledge made its sequels difficult to play as standalone titles. In contrast, the portrayal of the mythos in Type-0 was praised by RPG Site's Erren Van Duine in an import review of the title, with him saying that \\"elements such as l'Cie and fal'Cie are handled in much more interesting ways\\". When commenting on the lore of Final Fantasy XV, Andrew Reiner of Game Informer praised the story for sticking to basics and avoiding \\"[overwhelming] the player with lore or branching threads, something Final Fantasy XIII struggled with\\". = Individual titles = Final Fantasy XIII was positively received in Japanese magazines, garnering exceptionally high scores from both Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation. In the west, the game was praised for its graphics, battle system, and music, but opinions were mixed about its story and it was criticized for its highly linear structure. XIII also won an award for best graphics in GamesRadars 2012 Platinum Trophy Awards. XIII-2 received a positive reception overall, gaining perfect scores from Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation, and high scores from most western sites. Common points of praise were its non-linear nature, improved battle system and graphics, while the main points of criticism were its story and characters, which were often called weak, confusing or both. Lightning Returns received mixed to positive reviews, with its combat being highly praised, its graphics and time limit mechanic drawing mixed responses, and the story and characters being cited as poorly developed. Type-0 had a highly positive reception in Japan, with it garnering near-perfect scores in Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation. Import reviews were also fairly positive, sharing many points of praise with the Japanese reviews. Type-0 HD also received a positive reception in the west, with main praise going to the story, characters and action-based gameplay. Other aspects came in for criticism, such as elements of the graphics upgrade, the real-time strategy segments, and the localization. Western previews of Agito have also been positive, with critics agreeing that it looked good on the platform and worked well from a gameplay standpoint. Final Fantasy XV was positively received by many journalists; praise went to aspects of the story, the main characters, battle system and graphics, while the overarching plot, supporting cast and other technical elements such as the camera and late-game changes in gameplay were criticized. = Sales = Final Fantasy XIII broke sales records for the Final Fantasy franchise, selling 1.5 million units in Japan on its release day, and a further million a month after its North American release. XIII-2 was the most purchased title of 2011 in Japan upon release, and reached second and first place in sales charts in the United States and United Kingdom respectively. Lightning Returns had lower first-week sales than its predecessors, but still topped the sales charts in Japan, selling over 277,000 units in its first week and over 404,000 copies by the end of 2013. It ranked as third and eighth in the UK and US February sales charts respectively. Approximately 800,000 copies were sold by as of November 2014. The three XIII games have collectively sold 11 million units worldwide. Speaking of the decreasing success of the XIII games and their effect on the Fabula Nova Crystallis series on USGamer, Parish felt that the initial backlash received by XIII had turned the \\"XIII\\" moniker into \\"box office poison\\". Type-0 sold over 472,000 units in its first week, and went on to sell over 740,000 units in Japan. The title was also added to the company's list of Ultimate Hits, re-releases of lucrative titles. Type-0 HD reached the top of the sales charts in its debut week, selling 93,000 units, though it ultimately performed poorly in Japan. It was among the ten top-selling games in March for the UK and US. By April, Type-0 HD had shipped over one million copies worldwide. Agito was highly successful in Japan, achieving 500,000 registered users within a week of release. By November of the year of release, the game had received one million downloads. Awakening met with commercial success in China, achieving two million downloads within its month of release. Upon its release, Final Fantasy XV sold five million copies worldwide through retail shipments and digital sales, breaking sales records for the Final Fantasy franchise. It has sold over nearly nine million copies as of October 2019. =Official response= Speaking in a 2014 feature on the series, Kitase and Toriyama commented that the initial structure and goals of the project had worked against it, causing the mythos narrative to become unfocused and difficult for players to follow within a single game. In the aftermath, Square Enix decided to move away from the complex narrative style that had accompanied the mythos, instead focusing on telling more understandable standalone stories. Tabata described the decision to distance Final Fantasy XV from the mythos brand as a complicated but necessary one.

He played the bass guitar in the band whilst his younger brother Derek Longmuir was drummer. Biography Longmuir was born at Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion Hospital, Edinburgh. His father was an undertaker. A member of a musical family, he formed his first band at the age of 17, with his brother Derek and two others. They changed their name and line-up to become the Bay City Rollers. Until their career took off, he worked as a plumber. In 1976, at the height of the band's popularity, Alan Longmuir left and was replaced by rhythm guitarist Ian Mitchell, a man ten years his junior, who would in turn make way for Pat McGlynn. Tam Paton, then the group's manager, alleged that Longmuir had tried to commit suicide. Paton's own conduct was later revealed as a contributory factor in the unhappiness of some band members. In 1977, Longmuir released \\"I'm Confessing\\", which peaked at number 44 in Australia. Longmuir returned to the group in 1978 following McGlynn's departure, and thereafter switched between bass guitar, rhythm guitar and keyboards. He also played piano accordion. Longmuir was married twice, first to Jan Longmuir, from 1985 until their divorce in 1990; they had one son, Jordan. His second marriage was to Eileen Rankin, and lasted from 1998 until his death; Eileen had two sons of her own. In 2016, it was claimed that Eileen had fought backstage with the wife of another band member, after the latter criticised Alan Longmuir's playing at a reunion concert. While owner of the Castle Campbell Hotel in Dollar, Clackmannanshire, he suffered two heart attacks and a stroke, and in 2000 he decided to retrain as a building inspector.

She debuted as a hidden character in the PlayStation version of the fighting game Dead or Alive in 1998, and has appeared in all of its sequels and spin-offs so far, including as the main protagonist of Dead or Alive 3. In the games, Ayane is a teenage master of ninjutsu and is characterised by her complex relationship with her half-sister Kasumi, the lead character of the Dead or Alive series. She is also prominently featured as a recurring supporting character in the Ninja Gaiden series since its revival in 2004 and has made multiple guest appearances in other games, in particular in the extended Dynasty Warriors franchise. Ayane is one of the most popular Tecmo characters and is one of Koei Tecmo's mascots, but has been a subject of controversies regarding her age and sexualization. Character Ayane is officially one of the \\"faces\\" of Dead or Alive. In the series' back story, Ayane was conceived and born as a result of the evil ninja Raidou's rape of Ayame, Kasumi's and Hayate's mother and wife of Shiden, leader of the ninja clan.The Mugen Tenshin villagers allowed Ayane to stay, but disliked and looked down on her. Deemed a cursed child, she was forced to live in the shadows. Since they were children, Ayane has secretly admired Hayate as a way of increasing her self-esteem. Hayate is portrayed as fond of her in return. Ayane's ire focusses on Raidou who both created and ruined her life, but she is also hatefully jealous of her half-sister Kasumi and her privileged upbringing. Ayane's belligent envy towards Kasumi is similar to the hatred Raidou displayed towards his brother Shiden. Depicted as quiet and reserved, Ayane has honed her skills in an attempt to make others see her as more than a \\"child of evil\\". Her deadly fighting style has given her the nickname \\"Female Tengu\\". With the death of her foster father and master, Genra (Omega) at the end of Dead or Alive 3, Ayane becomes the strongest ninja of Mugen Tenshin's shadow clan, the secretive , and pledges her existence to assist in Hayate's task of destroying the Dead or Alive Tournament Executive Committee (DOATEC). Through most of the series, Ayane was a bitter rival to Kasumi. Ayane has a tsundere type personality, is fiercely loyal to Hayate,Dead or Alive 4 manual, page 16. and admires Ryu Hayabusa, the protagonist of the Ninja Gaiden series. She later became one of the lead characters of Ninja Gaiden herself. =Design= left Ayane is the youngest female to appear as a playable character in the Dead or Alive series, having been introduced at the age of only 16. She stands at 5'2\\" and weighs 104 lbs, with a bust size of 93 cm (37\\"), and has one of the most distinctive appearances out of DOA girls due to her unusually colored purple hair and red eyes. Her face changed slightly between Ninja Gaiden II and Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.Brian Ashcraft, Ayane, Your Face Looks A Little Different , Kotaku, July 27, 2009.

DOA5 director Yohei Shimbori said the developers received a strong if surprising fan backlash from their initial attempt at Ayane's breast reduction in this game, resulting in them reverting this change. Shimbori described Ayane as \\"extremely serious, but when she starts to interact like Zack or Marie Rose, she changes a little bit.\\" Ayane's fighting style is very different from the Tenjin Mon style of Kasumi and Hayate,The Babes of DOA , IGN, March 26, 2010. being more flayboyant and based on pirouetting and spinning attacks.Leon Hunt, Kung Fu Cult Masters, Wallflower Press, 2003 (p. 187).

His successor Yosuke Hayashi said the image of Ayane covered in her enemies' blood can symbolise the intensity of Ninja Gaiden. Hayashi later requested for Ayane to appear in the Fatal Frame series. Ayane's appearance of a \\"sweet girl\\" is misleading and hides her \\"devious nature\\".Hilary Goldstein, Girls of DOAU: Ayane , IGN, September 23, 2004. She wears a variety of mostly purple and black female ninja suits and other attires (including a schoolgirl uniformDead or Alive 2 Schoolgirl Outfits Revealed , IGN, March 8, 2000. and a Carnival of Venice-style costumeMike Fahey, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Gets Fashionable DLC , Kotaku, November 13, 2009.), often coming with a miniskirt or tunic and often featuring a butterfly motif (later even on her weaponsPete Haas, Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge Has Playable Ayane , Gaming Blend, 2012-09-12.).

One of her alternative costumes in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 also pays homage to Sun Shangxiang (Lady Sun) from Koei's Dynasty Warriors series.Jim Sterling, Ninja Gaiden invades Dynasty Warriors , Destructoid, 09.23.2009. Her other wardrobe in Last Round includes outfits designed by Tamiki Wakaki, a destructible green dress in 2014 and a purple armor in 2016, as well as downloadable costumes based on the Clockwork Princess Millennia from Tecmo Koei's Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess, Fie Claussell from Nihon Falcom's The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II, Satoka Sumihara from Square Enix's School Girl Strikers, Cocona from Tatsunoko's Nurse Witch Komugi, Nene from Samurai Warriors, and Yukino Aguria from Fairy Tail, among others. Her default costume in Dead or Alive 6 is to feature an Assassin's Creed style hood, described as \\"a cool new look but keeping things as punk and pink as ever.\\" =Gameplay= Ayane is often regarded as a top-tier character in many of the games she is playable in, especially in the DOA fighting games where she was noted for being very unpredictable and confusing for the opponent as well as fast and hard to counter. In 2016, Jeuxvideo.com included her among the ten most frustrating characters to play against in any fighting game due to her potential for \\"very destabilizing\\" quick attacks. Previewing the original Dead or Alive for the PlayStation, Computer & Video Games opined she \\"has an unusual floaty kind of fighting style, but has some great moves. Her quick punches make stringing combos together easy, and her throws are great for hitting people into the Danger Zone\\" (an interactive feature within some arenas).Computer & Video Games 200 (July 1998) page 48. In Prima Games' official guide for Dead or Alive Ultimate (a remake version of Dead or Alive and Dead or Alive 2), Eric Mylonas declared Ayane the \\"tougher of the two siblings\\" as she \\"brings strings of blindingly fast combos into play and has devastating holds and throws.\\" Ayane has a major weakness in that she can not stop moving without becoming \\"an easy prey,\\" and she may not be favored by those who prefer \\"huge, over-the-top moves,\\" but for a \\"more patient sort, there's probably no better character in the game.\\"Eric Mylonas, Dead or Alive Ultimate (Prima Official Game Guide), Prima Games 2004 (p. 72). According to GameSpy's guide to Ultimate by Andrew Alfonso, Ayane's key moves include her high kick‚Äîwhich is \\"a lot\\" better than Kasumi's‚Äîwith another move so powerful \\"it's almost unfair to use it.\\" He noted how she can be actually more effective with her back turned towards her opponent, despite the fact that the characters cannot block when facing away from an enemy.Andrew Alfonso, Dead or Alive Ultimate - xbox - Walkthrough and Guide - Page 31 , GameSpy, January 24, 2004. In his guide to Dead or Alive 3, he wrote Ayane is a very unpredictable and quick attacker, even more than in the previous games in the series, and should be played primarily for her backwards position, hers being the best such stance of all the characters in the game. Ayane's speed and deceiving attacks make her a \\"pretty good\\" partner for slower fighters for tag team battles, but her primary partners are other ninja characters.Andrew Alfonso, Dead or Alive 3 - xbox - Walkthrough and Guide - Page 20, GameSpy, January 15, 2001. In Prima Games' official guide to Dead or Alive 4, Bryan Dawson wrote that while in the previous games Ayane has been \\"one of the easiest characters to use and was very difficult to fight against,\\" in this game she \\"now requires much more skill in high-level players, as her best attack as nowhere as dominant as they were in the past.\\" She was rated overall 7/10.Bryan Dawson, Dead or Alive 4 (Prima Official Game Guide), Prima Games 2006 (p. 61). On the other hand, for Daniel Wilks from Hyper Ayane in DOA4 seemed \\"to have the edge in nearly every battle due to their staggering speed and ability to put together easy multi-leveled combos.\\"Hyper 151, page 62. According to GameSpot's guide by Matthew Rorie, Ayane is \\"one of the more devious characters\\" of the game, \\"capable of devastating speed and some ingenious little fake-out animations,\\" but she requires \\"a lot more practice than is apparent at first glance.\\"Matthew Rorie, Dead or Alive 4 Walkthrough - Page 9 - Game Guides, GameSpot. In GameSpy's guide, David McCutcheon wrote that \\"widely regarded as the [Street Fighter characters] Ken/Ryu of the Dead or Alive series, Ayane can be both incredibly cheap and remarkably skilled,\\" as \\"rolling and spinning will work wonders\\" for the player's countering effects and one \\"can juggle enemies to endless amounts of pain.\\"David McCutcheon, Dead or Alive 4 - xbox360 - Walkthrough and Guide - Page 14 , GameSpy, January 24, 2006. Ayane's move set in an early version of Dead or Alive 5 seems almost identical to this in DOA4,David Hinkle, Beautiful brawling in Dead or Alive 5 , Joystiq, December 10, 2011. but she gained some new moves. In an official description of the character, Koei Tecmo wrote that \\"her mastery of ever- changing moves means her opponents never know what is coming.\\" Ayane's gameplay abilities in other games were regarded more variably. In the DOA beach volleyball games, Ayane has excellent technique and jump abilities, at the cost of poor defence, power and speed.Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 manual, page 10. According to Official Xbox Magazine, Ayane is \\"not exactly who you want to spike at the net or try to blow past blocks, but she's excellent at long spikes, digging, and soft dinks.\\" As such, Ayane is most effective as a support, but she should not be paired with Kasumi due to their rivalry;EGM 160 page 186. to partner with each other, Ayane and Kasumi need convincing by gift-giving.GMR 1 (February 2003) page 61. In Ninja Gaiden Œ£ 2, Ayane's attacks (many of her Fuma Kodachi combos resemble her combos from Dead or Alive) and finishing moves are far faster than these of Ryu, but the player has to learn to dodge much more as she has worse blocking abilities.Hands-on  Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 , Resolution Magazine, June 27, 2009. The official guide to this game by Prima's Bryan Dawson states that Ayane's short range and limited attack power \\"make her the worst choice of the three new characters for almost every mission\\" and \\"her only saving graces\\" are a powerful ninpo spell and deadly Flash Kunai projectiles. In addition, if controlled by the console in the co-op mode, the character \\"doesn't seem to know what to do in any situation.\\"Bryan Dawson, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2: Prima Official Guide, Prima Games 2009 (p. 28, 51). Mitch Dyer of IGN opined that a vastly improved Ayane from Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge is \\"a damn fine addition\\" to the game, where she is \\"just as capable as Ryu Hayabusa\\" with her \\"quick and vicious\\" melee attacks and explosive kunai projectiles, adding that she is \\"functionally similar to Hayabusa in terms of combos and skills, complete with a screen- clearing special move.\\"Mitch Dyer, TGS: Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge Repairs Past Mistakes: Violet violence., September 19, 2012. Similarly, Retro Gamer described her simply as \\"a nimbler version of Ryu.\\"Retro Gamer 113, page 100. According to X360's David Lynch all the \\"girls\\" of Razor's Edge (Ayane, Kasumi and Momiji) became \\"just as deadly\\" in it as Ryu Hayabusa has been through the Ninja Gaiden series.X360 Magazine UK 97, page 75. In Fatal Frame, unlike the protagonists of the game, Ayane can not permanently defeat ghosts and her strategy relies on evasion. Appearances =In video games= Dead or Alive Ayane was originally introduced as an unnamed training dummy in the Sega Saturn version of Dead or Alive, before she became a player character in the 1998 PlayStation port, in which she is an opponent character in the practice and tournament modes (Ayane was later included in the Dead or Alive ++ arcade edition) as well as an unlockable secret character.Jason Rybka, Dead or Alive Cheats - PlayStation (PS1) , About.com. In the original DOA, Ayane has had neither a written background nor in-game plot-line (according to the later canon, Ayane was sent to secretly follow Kasumi).Dead or Alive 5 Official Site: The story so far... , Team Ninja. In Dead or Alive 2 (1999), Ayane joins in the Dead or Alive World Combat Championship as an assassin in pursuit of her half-sister Kasumi, a runaway shinobi who has left the Mugen Tenshin behind and been branded a \\"traitor\\" to their clan. Ayane encounters and rescues an amnesiac Hayate, who goes by the name \\"Ein\\". When confronting Helena, Ayane is accused of murdering Helena's mother Maria, but the assassin is later revealed to be Christie. In Dead or Alive 3 (2001), her former teacher and beloved foster parent, Genra, has disappeared. Ayane, now the most powerful member and de facto leader of Hajin Mon, learns that Genra has been turned into a puppet by the DOATEC and its sinister Omega Project and realises that fate commands her to put Genra out of his misery.Anthony Chau, Dead or Alive 3 - xbox - Walkthrough and Guide - Page 20, GameSpy, January 15, 2001. Achieving this, she emerges as the official winner of the third DOA championship. The introductory sequence to Dead or Alive Ultimate, accompanied by Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\", was the first to hint at the origins of Ayane and Kasumi's enmity. Itagaki confirmed Ayane as the game's main protagonist.Raymond Padilla, Itagaki Speaks on Dead or Alive Ultimate , GameSpy, May 16, 2004. In Dead or Alive 4 (2005), Ayane has pledged her life to her half-brother and Mugen Tenshin clan leader Hayate, in his cause to destroy the DOATEC for the suffering the company has caused the ninja clans. Ayane has a threefold stake in this plot: she wants revenge for Raidou being changed into a monster, for Hayate being brainwashed in their attempt to realize Project Epsilon, and for the manipulation and death of Genra. At the end of the game, Ayane uses her ninpo (\\"ninja arts\\") spell to blow up the DOATEC Tri-Tower.Ayane's ending cutscene in Dead or Alive 4.

Ayane follows Kasumi upon Hayate's orders, and later discovers that she is in fact really an Alpha clone. Ayane and Hayate learn from Helena that Victor Donovan and his new organization, MIST, plan to sell his Alpha clones as super soldiers to various countries around the world. They infiltrate the oil rig platform where Helena believes MIST's secret laboratory is hidden. After Ayane and Hayate kill Kasumi's clone, they breach into the lab, but Hayate is captured by Rig and Ayane is forced to flee. After Ryu summons the real Kasumi to battle and Hayate is rescued, they destroy the laboratory and Alpha-152. Ayane is again a playable character in Dead or Alive 6. After witnessing Honoka utilize fight-copying abilities similar to that of Raidou, she keeps tabs on her, and eventually fights her in person to gauge her abilities. She eventually tries to capture Honoka to put her into protective custody, but ends up fighting Marie Rose, Honoka's bodyguard and friend. Due to this, Honoka ends up easily captured by MIST, with Ayane eventually working together with Marie Rose to rescue her. However, Ayane herself ends up captured by MIST's head researcher, NiCO, to \\"aid\\" in Raidou's revival alongside Honoka (who is revealed to be Ayane's half-sister via Raidou, hence Honoka's similar powers to Raidou), although not before sending a distress signal to Hayate and Kasumi. Ayane is then brainwashed by NiCO as a deterrent against Kasumi, however she is later brought back to her senses and fights alongside her family to destroy Raidou. Besides the main DOA series, Ayane appears as one of the player characters in the beach volleyball spin-off games Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball (2003), Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 (2006) and Dead or Alive Paradise (2010), pursuing Kasumi.

Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= Her real name is Gayle Marsh. At the age of twelve, she developed psychic powers, primarily psychokinesis. After her parents died she was raised by the scientist David Pendergast who was preparing to fight a new menace called \\"the Decay\\". In college, she took the alias of Psi and fought Supergirl several times, thinking that Supergirl was the Decay. The truth was that David Pendergast was an extension of her own fears. Realizing that the Decay was David and herself, she put a stop to Pendergast and herself. =Post-Crisis= Psi‚Äôs first appearance in the Post Crisis DC Universe was with the Suicide Squad. She had no memory of her real name or history, as an unknown event \\"has nearly shattered her psyche\\".\\"Doom Patrol and Suicide Squad\\" #1 (1988) She joined in order to gain help from the Suicide Squad in restoring her lost memory and accompanied Rick Flag and a similarly untested team for a mission in Central America, but she was killed by the Rocket Red Brigade. As she lay dying, she remembers her real name, Gayle Marsh, as well as her mother and father. Her allies, Mister 104, the Thinker and the Weasel are also killed on the mission.\\"Doom Patrol and Suicide Squad\\" #1 (1988) During the events of Blackest Night, Psi's corpse is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps alongside several other fallen Suicide Squad members.Suicide Squad #67 (January 2010) Psi is apparently destroyed by the Manhunter's self-destruct mechanism unleashing an explosion of Green Lantern energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.Secret Six (vol. 3) #18 (February 2010) =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Psi is reintroduced as a prisoner in \\"The Circus\\", the Detroit station for A.R.G.U.S. operations. Steve Trevor and Killer Frost visit her cell to see if she can disrupt the Firestorm Matrix in order to free the imprisoned Justice Leagues. When Psi touches him however, Trevor is flooded with images, which he realizes connects everything he already knew, based on the clue Madame Xanadu told him, and tells him how to save the Justice League. One of the visions that Psi showed Steve Trevor was that Wonder Woman's lasso is in the possession of Cheetah.Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S. #4 Other versions Pai appeared in the digital first comic book Adventures of Supergirl series. This version of Psi was a Kryptonian psychic who was an employee of Fort Rozz prison, working as its \\"dream mistress\\", controlling the dreams of its prisoners in order to secure their mental health. She lost her physical form when Fort Rozz crashed, and was manipulated by a villainess named Facet Jens into becoming an enemy of Supergirl, though eventually she was redeemed once Facet's true intentions were revealed. In other media Psi appears in the episode \\"Triggers\\" of the third season of Supergirl, portrayed by Yael Grobglas. Her primary psychic ability is to trigger incapacitating fear in others, either by making them relive a traumatic event or confronting a fearsome element. Nicknamed \\"Psi\\" by authorities, Gayle Marsh was \\"a law-abiding citizen of Skokie, Illinois\\" until she \\"snapped\\" and began robbing banks. Supergirl tries several times to apprehend Psi, but the criminal stops her by making her relive the trauma of being sent away from Krypton just before it exploded and being lost in the Phantom Zone. Supergirl ultimately manages to overcome her fears enough to resist Psi's attacks and capture her. Psi makes a return in \\"Fort Rozz\\" where she, along with Saturn Girl and Livewire, is recruited by Supergirl for a team to infiltrate the Kryptonian prison Fort Rozz to gain information on Reign. During the mission, she inadvertently uses powers on Saturn Girl after a blow to the head. Psi later saves Supergirl from Reign using her powers after Livewire sacrifices herself to save Supergirl. After returning to Earth Psi gives Supergirl her condolences for Live Wire's death. Supergirl in return asks that Psi be given a better room during her incarceration which prompts Psi to smile at her. In the episode \\"Alex in Wonderland,\\" Alex in her virtual reality experience as Supergirl has an offscreen fight with Psi. She is arrested by the D.E.O. even though Psi's face isn't shown.

Currently housed at the Buyeo National Museum, it was originally excavated at an ancient temple site in Neungsan-ri, Buyeo County in Chungcheongnam-do in 1993. The incense burner was the largest find among the 450 artifacts excavated. The Gilt-bronze Incense Burner of Baekje is a symbol of the artistry of the Baekje people and a masterpiece of Korean art. The incense burner measures 64 centimeters in height, the body is 19 centimeters in diameter, and weighs 11.8 kilograms. It was probably made in the 6th century. History \\"One of the crowning excavation achievements in the past century, the Baekje Gilt-Bronze Incense Burner, gave a critical turning point to the studies in the Baekje Dynasty history. The Burner embraces the mind of the Baekje people who delicately chased their ideal world with exquisite techniques and high appreciative eyes. The Incense Burner of this kind has not been found anywhere in the world since then. It is no wonder that it can be really called a masterpiece\\", according to the Culture and Tourism website published by Chungcheongnam-do. It had been widely believed the Baekje incense burner might have been copied from the Baksan (Hangul: Î∞ïÏÇ∞ Ìñ•Î°ú, Hanja: ÂçöÂ±±È¶ôÁàê) burners of Han Dynasty until recently when a Korean research team comprising historians and archaeologists made a great discovery that it differed from the ancient Chinese prototypes in its structure and designs, particularly in view of its five musicians in relief, which did not constitute the ornamental design element of the Han dynasty incense burners. In addition, one musical instrument in relief gave another clue to the study. The musical instrument called 'Wanham' (Hangul: ÏôÑÌï®, Hanja: ÈòÆÂí∏) was first introduced to the Tang Dynasty in the 7th century after the Baekje kingdom disappeared into oblivion. The musical instrument came to be widely popular later in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty, according to the New Book of Tang (Traditional Chinese: Êñ∞ÂîêÊõ∏, which also showed the name of the instrument 'Wanham', named eponymically after a then-prominent artist of the Tang period about a century later than when the Baekje incense burner was made. The 'Wanham' originated from Kucha, where in the Kizil Caves the earliest form of this musical instrument can still be seen. The Baekje burner uses realism and is three-dimensional. The incense burner incorporates Buddhist and Taoist themes but some theorize that the burner symbolizes themes of Northeast Asian culture. The dragon and phoenix suggest a yin and yang motif, and because it was excavated from what was probably a Buddhist temple, this theory has some weight. However, the uniqueness of the artifact suggests that the burner may have been used for ancestral rites or other unique ceremonies. Appearance The incense burner can be classified in four parts: the body, lid, the phoenix-shaped knob, and the support plate. The lid is encircled by 74 mountains thinly cast in five layers reaching the top. The lid also contains various figures cast in relief including five musicians with different instruments, sixteen other figures, and thirty-nine animals including tigers, dragons, and deer. The lid also has different kinds of scenery including six types of trees, boulders, trails, waterfalls, and lakes which may symbolize the ideal landscape of a Taoist hermit. Five birds sit at the top of the five highest peaks of the mountain, and the top of the lid is crowned with a dragon. The lid is also ventilated with five holes, one in the chest of the phoenix, to release the scent of the incense. The top of the lid is capped with a bonghwang (phoenix) which holds a magic pearl. The tail of the bonghwang curves out in an arching fashion. The body of the burner is shaped in the form of a blossoming lotus. The petals of the lotus also contain twenty-six animals on the lateral surface including fish, heavenly beasts, and birds. Some of the animals rest between the lotus petals, while others are top. The support plate is in the shape of a dragon with its mouth facing the base of the body which it supports. The dragon is surrounded by a blowing bronze motif of clouds, and its own tail is arched, giving the base a sense of movement. Archaeological significance The discovery that this archaeological find is different from the Han Dynasty incense burners means a lot to historians, archaeologists and bibliographers internationally. The fact that the musical instrument originated from Kucha, which provided an oasis and gateway to the Silk Road, sheds new light onto the then-current geopolitical equilibrium, cultural exchanges, and trade routes extending towards the three kingdoms on the Korean Peninsula and ancient Japan as well. In other words, the musical instrument, even before it was eponymically named wanham in the Tang Dynasty, found its way into the Baekje incense burner.

Howard Vos has suggested that the \\"coat of many colors\\" said to have been worn by Joseph could be similar to the colorful foreign garments seen in the painting. In the Hebrew Bible, the coat of many colors ( ketonet passim) is the name for the garment that Joseph owned, which was given to him by his father Jacob. The problem of translation According to the King James Version, Genesis 37:3 reads, \\"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.\\"Genesis 37, King James. Ford Madox Brown, The Coat of Many Colours; some have suggested that the phrase may merely mean a \\"coat with long sleeves\\" The Septuagint translation of the passage uses the word (poikilos),Genesis 37, Septuagint. which indicates \\"many colored\\";Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott (1889). An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon: œÄŒøŒπŒ∫ŒØŒªŒøœÇ. the Jewish Publication Society of America Version also employs the phrase \\"coat of many colors\\".Genesis 37, JPS. On the other hand, the Revised Standard Version translates ketonet passim as \\"a long robe with sleeves\\" while the New International Version notes the translation difficulties in a footnote, and translates it as \\"a richly ornamented robe\\".Genesis 37, NIV. Aryeh Kaplan in The Living Torah gives a range of possible explanations: : Kethoneth passim in Hebrew. It was a royal garment; 2 Samuel 13:18 (cf. Ralbag ad loc.). The word passim can be translated as 'colorful' (Radak; Septuagint), embroidered (Abraham ibn Ezra; Bahya ibn Paquda; Nachmanides on Exodus 28:2), striped (Jonah ibn Janah; Radak, Sherashim), or with pictures (Targum Jonathan). It can also denote a long garment, coming down to the palms of the hands (Rashbam; Ibn Ezra; Tosafot; Genesis Rabbah 84), and the feet (Lekach Tov). Alternatively, the word denotes the material out of which the coat was made, which was fine wool (Rashi) or silk (Ibn Janach). Hence, kethoneth passim, may be translated as \\"a full-sleeved robe\\", \\"a coat of many colors\\", \\"a coat reaching to his feet\\", \\"an ornamented tunic\\", \\"a silk robe\\", or \\"a fine woolen cloak\\". James Swanson suggests that the phrase indicates a \\"tunic or robe unique in design for showing special favor or relationship\\" and that \\"either the robe was very long-sleeved and extending to the feet, or a richly- ornamented tunic either of special color design or gold threading, both ornamental and not suitable for working.\\"James Swanson, Dictionary of Biblical Languages With Semantic Domains: Hebrew (Old Testament) (Electronic ed. Oak Harbor : Logos Research Systems, Inc., 1997). The phrase is used one other time in the Hebrew Scriptures, to describe the garment worn by Tamar, daughter of David, in 2 Samuel 13:18-19. In Genesis Joseph cast into the pit. Joseph's father Jacob (also called Israel) favored him and gave Joseph the coat as a gift; as a result, he was envied by his brothers, who saw the special coat as an indication that Joseph would assume family leadership. His brothers' suspicion grew when Joseph told them of his two dreams (Genesis 37:11) in which all the brothers bowed down to him. The narrative tells that his brothers plotted against him when he was 17, and would have killed him had not the eldest brother Reuben interposed. He persuaded them instead to throw Joseph into a pit and secretly planned to rescue him later. However, while Reuben was absent, the others planned to sell him to a company of Ishmaelite merchants. When the passing Midianites arrived, the brothers dragged Joseph up and sold him to the merchants for 20 pieces of silver. The brothers then dipped Joseph's coat in goat blood and showed it to their father, who assumed that Joseph had been torn apart by wild beasts. Joseph's coat, by Diego Vel√°zquez (1630), depicts Joseph's brothers bringing the coat to their father Jacob and asking him to identify it. The envy of his brothers may have stemmed from the fact that Joseph was the son of Rachel, Jacob's first love. However, Joseph's brothers were the sons of Rachel's older sister Leah and the sons of the handmaidens, who were given to Jacob during a time when Rachel could not conceive. There was a battle between Leah and Rachel to compete for Jacob's attention. Jacob had told Joseph, when he was seventeen years old, to go check on his brothers. Joseph would report back to his father of their evil deeds. In addition to this he shares his dreams of them bowing down to him. Their anger towards him only increased. In popular culture *The coat is featured in the musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. * In 1997, Anita Diamant's novel The Red Tent, Dinah mentions that Rachel is making a colorful garment for her son Joseph; she also mentions that it will make him the target of his brothers' taunting. *In the 1997 video game Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night for PlayStation, a cloak called \\"Joseph's cloak\\" can be found in the American localization of the game. It also features adjustable colors in the equip screen of the game as further reference from the Bible. *The story is referenced in the 1971 Dolly Parton song \\"Coat of Many Colors\\".

Mitchell was replaced in the final by Regan Harrison (who came fourth in the 200-metre breaststroke), who combined with Matt Welsh, Geoff Huegill and Michael Klim to claim silver, behind the Americans who broke the world record. Leadership role In March 2002, Mitchell was appointed Chairman of the Australian Swimmers‚Äô Commission, a professional association promoting the increasingly professional sport of swimming in that continent.

However, there have been animals in captivity on the site since 1905, when red foxes were introduced and bred by J.A. Turner. In 1920, a small collection of animals featuring a pair of mule deer was started by Tustin rancher Sam Nau. Eventually Nau built a pen for the deer. The main attraction was an alligator exhibit until a bird exhibit including cockatoos, quail, doves, and parakeets was added in 1935. Animals Animals at the zoo are primarily from the Southwestern United States, and include, black bears, cougars, bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, barn owls, great horned owls, porcupines, coyotes, mule deer, turkey vultures, coati, and bobcats. The zoos residents come to them injured, orphaned, abandoned, or as confiscated pets, and these animals help teach visitors about the animals they may encounter in the hill, canyons, and backyards of the area. The zoo includes a barnyard with domestic animals such as goats, jacob sheep, doves, and pheasants. Visitors can purchase grain to feed the animals here, and can even touch some of them. Other facilities The zoo offers cell phone audio tours. Visitors can hear information about the animals in the exhibit from the animal keepers, veterinarian, education coordinator, and curator, including their names, diet, where they came from, and why they are at the zoo.

It was shown on Network Ten and was seen from 1992 until 1998.Healthy, Wealthy and Wise at the Internet Movie Database. Retrieved 20 June 2007. The programme also helped re-invent the then-ailing network after its financial collapse of the late 1980s. It helped popularise the lifestyle genre in Australia, and it also spawned a number of imitators during the 1990s, including the Seven Network's Better Homes and Gardens, which is still seen today. The show was created and produced by Michael Dickinson and Executive Producer Gavan Disney, once the producer of the Nine Network's long- running variety show Hey Hey it's Saturday and packaged by Disney Entertainment P/L for the Ten Network and its affiliates throughout the world. The title takes its name from the proverb, \\"Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\\" This quote is often attributed to Benjamin Franklin since it appeared in his Poor Richard's Almanack; however, it was first used in print by John Clarke in a 1639 book of English and Latin proverbs. (Consequently, as it is a proverb, Clarke was also probably not the original author but was simply passing on a common saying.) Cast Notable people associated with the programme included Felicity Kennett, wife of the then Premier of Victoria Jeff Kennett, and Jim Brown, a former Ten eyewitness news journalist. Others such as Iain Hewitson used the opportunity to develop an ongoing TV career with the show as a starting point, including crafts lady Tonia Todman.

The series is an alternate history retelling of the 1960s and 1970s, featuring a team of government-sponsored heroes named the Civil Defense Corps. Much of the series revolves around the introduction of an African American superhero to the team and the responses of the team, government, and public. The series debuted with an eight-issue limited series published by WildStorm and was written by John Ridley with art from Georges Jeanty. The original series ran for eight issues, from April to September 2006. A follow-up series to the original, The American Way: Those Above and Those Below ran six issues, from July to February 2017 with Ridley and Jeanty returning as the creative team. Publication history The American Way In an interview with National Public Radio, John Ridley stated that the inspiration for this story came from President Lyndon Johnson's wish to include an African-American in the Mercury Space Program. In addition, Ridley noted that he had deliberately employed many different forms of superhero archetypes in order to make the comic more approachable to readers, as well as saying that the U.S. Army's rescuing of Jessica Lynch and the subsequent media narrative, as well as the unraveling of said narrative, inspired the propaganda element of the story.A Disenchanted Look at 'The American Way' : NPR Plot = The American Way = The first issue introduces the Civil Defense Corps, a team of superheroes, and their handlers the FDAA (Federal Disaster Assistance Administration). The FDAA stages showdowns between \\"superheroes\\" and \\"supervillains\\", who are in reality little more than superpowered actors that front for the public. The FDAA is put on the spot when Old Glory, a hero representing the epitome of American ideals, dies of a heart attack during a staged superhero battle.The American Way issue #1. The New American is introduced in the next issue. Offered as Old Glory's replacement, the New American is secretly an African American man named Jason Fisher. Jason was selected by the FDAA to undergo gene therapy treatments that gave him superstrength and invulnerability, but with a built in weakness: Jason had the pain receptors of a normal human, so that if he was subjected to enough pain he would die even if his skin remained unbroken. The New American is outfitted in a helmet and a pseudo Astronaut's uniform, because 1962 America was depicted in the series as not ready for a minority superhero.The American Way issue #2. The New American is accidentally \\"unmasked\\" at the end of the third issue, while battling a crazed Wanderer.The American Way issue #3. In the fourth issue the FDAA unleash Hellbent, a homicidal and sociopathic supervillain, to draw attention away from the racial strife caused by the New American's unmasking. The team is split in half along racial views with the southern heroes leaving in disgust, forming the Southern Defense Corps. Most of the rest go to confront Hellbent, who has slaughtered a busload of people on their way to a civil rights rally. They fail miserably, with CDC members Freya being decapitated, Pharos wounded, and The Secret Agent losing a hand. The New American's brother was among the wounded survivors. The fifth issue shows that Jason's brother was the sole survivor of Hellbent's slaughter but was tortured and left paralyzed. Members continue to debate recent events. The New American escapes to seek revenge on Hellbent after battling his teammates, thus defying the order not to cross the Mason-Dixon line. After this is found out by the SDC they go on to try to track him down. The New American eventually tracks down Hellbent in a secluded cabin in the forest. After a heated battle, Hellbent asks New American to \\"join him\\" and kill him. To goad him further, Hellbent reveals that he had raped his brother. This leads Jason to kill him in anger. In the following issues, the SDC‚Äîenraged over him killing \\"a white\\" (Hellbent)-hunt Jason until he becomes too exhausted to run. They then attempt to kill him in the street, but are stopped and fought by the CDC. Finally, Wesley \\"Wes\\" Chatham, a CDC handler and the main character, is convinced he must trick the CDC/SDC into stranding themselves in a remote area and killing them with nuclear missiles. This plan, however, was designed by Chet, another CDC handler, who reveals himself to be a Hellbent disciple. Since Chet \\"gets off on killing,\\" he's redirected three of the missiles toward major USA cities. Wes and the East Coast Intellectual realize this in the nick of time and help thwart the plan. The heroes, brought to a truce by Jason, stop most of the missiles.

Based in Crewe, England, he was a member of the well known spiritualists group, the Crewe Circle. He died in Salford hospital on 8 March 1933.Jolly, Martyn. (2006). Faces of the Living Dead: The Belief in Spirit Photography. Miegunyah Press. pp. 98-106. Biography As a young man Hope was employed as a carpenter, but he quickly came to prominence in paranormal circles after claiming to be able to capture images of spirits on camera. Hope produced his first spirit image in 1905. Soon afterwards he formed the Crewe Circle Spiritualist group, with himself as the leader. Harry Price, and friend. As taken by William Hope In 1916, Hope managed to dupe William Crookes with a fake spirit photograph of his wife. Oliver Lodge revealed there had been obvious signs of double exposure ‚Äì the picture of Lady Crookes had been copied from a wedding anniversary photograph. However, Crookes was a convinced spiritualist and claimed it was genuine evidence for spirit photography.Brock, William Hodson. (2008). William Crookes (1832-1919) and the Commercialization of Science. Ashgate. p. 474. Doubts were also raised about his spirit photography in 1908.Sladek, John Thomas. (1974). The New Apocrypha: A Guide to Strange Sciences and Occult Beliefs. Panther. p. 215. \\"Doubts were raised about the work of the British spirit photographer William Hope in 1908, when two of his clients each claimed that one of his ghostly 'extras' was their close relative. Hope continued to practice, though, and managed to con Conan Doyle and several prominent psychic researchers.\\" Hope was first exposed in 1920 by Edward Bush who had caught Hope out by using a trap. He used the fake name \\"Wood\\" and sent a letter to Hope with a photograph of a living person which he pretended was his deceased son. He later attended a sitting with Hope. Hope produced a \\"spirit\\" extra which was exactly the same as the photograph he had sent Hope and on it were the words \\"Dear friend Wood\\". The psychical researcher Whately Carington wrote regarding the exposure \\"any reasonable person will say that Mr Bush had proved his case.\\"Edmunds, Simeon. (1966). Spiritualism: A Critical Survey. Aquarian Press. pp. 115-116. In 1921, Mr DeVaga, a friend of the magician Harry Houdini, attended a sitting with Hope. DeVaga found the dark conditions in the room suspicious and suspected that Hope had switched a plate.Houdini, Harry. (2011, originally published in 1924). A Magician Among the Spirits. Cambridge University Press. pp. 123-133. =Price investigation= In February 1922, the Society for Psychical Research and the paranormal investigator Harry Price with James Seymour, Eric Dingwall and William Marriott demonstrated that Hope was fraudulent during tests at the British College of Psychic Science. Price wrote in his report \\"William Hope has been found guilty of deliberately substituting his own plates for those of a sitter... It implies that the medium brings to the sitting a duplicate slide and faked plates for fraudulent purposes.\\"Polidoro, Massimo. (2011). \\"Photos of Ghosts: The Burden of Believing the Unbelievable\\". Csicop.org. Retrieved 2014-10-11. Price secretly marked Hope's photographic plates, and provided him with a packet of additional plates that had been covertly etched with the brand image of the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd. in the knowledge that the logo would be transferred to any images created with them. Unaware that Price had tampered with his supplies, Hope then attempted to produce a number of spirit photographs. Although Hope produced several images of spirits, none of his materials contained the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd logo, or the marks that Price had put on Hope's original equipment, showing that he had exchanged prepared materials containing fake spirit images for the provided materials.Mulholland, John. (1938). Beware Familiar Spirits. Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 151-157. Nickell, Joe. (2005). Camera Clues: A Handbook for Photographic Investigation. The University Press of Kentucky. p. 153. Price later re-published the Society's experiment in a pamphlet of his own called Cold Light on Spiritualistic \\"Phenomena\\" - An Experiment with the Crewe Circle. Due to the exposure of Hope and other fraudulent spiritualists, Arthur Conan Doyle led a mass resignation of eighty-four members of the Society for Psychical Research, as they believed the Society was opposed to spiritualism.Nelson, G. K. (2013). Spiritualism and Society. Routledge. p. 159. Doyle threatened to have Price evicted from his laboratory and claimed if he persisted to write \\"sewage\\" about spiritualists, he would meet the same fate as Harry Houdini.Kalush, William; Sloman, Larry. (2006). The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero. Atria Books. pp. 419‚Äì420. Doyle and other spiritualists attacked Price and tried for years to have Price take his pamphlet out of circulation. Price wrote \\"Arthur Conan Doyle and his friends abused me for years for exposing Hope.\\"Polidoro, Massimo. (2001). Final S√©ance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle. Prometheus Books. p. 67. Despite Price's findings, Hope still retained a noted following amongst spiritualists. Doyle refused to accept any evidence that Hope was a fraud and even invoked a conspiracy that Price and other researchers had framed Hope. On this, Massimo Polidoro has written \\"the case of William Hope and his Crewe Circle deserves to be remembered today because it shows that it is practically impossible (and futile) to try to convince someone who wants to believe even in the face of quite convincing contrary evidence.\\" =Further exposures= Hope's exposures were discussed in detail by James Black in an article for the Scientific American in 1922. He concluded that Hope was a \\"common cheat who obtains money under false pretenses.\\"Black, James. (1922). The Spirit-Photograph Fraud: The Evidence of Trickery, and a Demonstration of the Tricks Employed. Scientific American. pp. 224‚Äì225, p. 286 Fred Barlow, a former friend and supporter of Hope's work and also the former Secretary of the Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures, along with Major W. Rampling-Rose, gave a joint lecture to the Society for Psychical Research to present findings gleaned from an extensive series of tests on the methods Hope used to produce his spirit photographs. They concluded that the spirits that appeared in Hope's photographs were produced fraudulently. In 1933, Hope was discredited when the pair presented their case in depth against him in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research.Edmunds, Simeon. (1966). Spiritualism: A Critical Survey. Aquarian Press. p. 116. \\"Hope was finally and completely discredited in 1933 in a famous paper in the Proceedings of the SPR by Fred Barlow and W. Rampling-Rose. Both photographic experts, they not only proved conclusively that Hope was fraudulent, but illustrated the methods by which he had faked his spirit pictures. Added weight was given to this exposure by the fact that Barlow was a former believer in spirit photography.\\" The psychical researcher Eric Dingwall also noted another exposure.Hankey, Muriel Winifred Arnold. (1963). James Hewat McKenzie, Pioneer of Psychical Research: A Personal Memoir. Garrett Publications. p. 139 \\"Although it was strongly suspected that Hope never produced any genuine psychic effects. Mr. McKenzie defended him vehemently, and, when looking into Hope's bag, found apparatus for producing these frauds, published nothing about it, and the facts only emerged long afterwards.\\" It involved James Hewat McKenzie who had discovered fraud but failed to make it public. According to Paul Tabori: > In 1933 the widow of the proprietor of the British College for Psychic > Science (where Price's s√©ance with Hope took place) admitted in an article > that after the sitting her husband went through Hope's luggage and \\"found in > a suitcase a flash lamp with a bulb attached, some cut-out photographic > heads and some hair\\". These basic facts were suppressed in 1922 and William > Hope wasn't \\"laid-low\\" conclusively until 1944 when Fred Barlow and W. > Rampling-Rose proved finally that during the extensive series of experiments > they had conducted with Hope all the \\"spirit extras\\" they had obtained could > have been fraudulently produced.\\"Tabori, Paul. (1972). Pioneers of the > Unseen. Souvenir Press. p. 89. During his photography sessions, Hope would sometimes carry out prayers and religious hymns. A 1969 entry for Hope in The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography described him as \\"undoubtedly a schizophrenic. On one side of his character was an alert, witty and patently honest North- countryman, whilst on the other hand there was the bogus medium who used prayers and psalm-singing as a cloak for his fraudulent operations.\\"Mannheim, L.

Training at the Australian Institute of Sport, he earned an Olympic berth the following year, anchoring the Australian 4 √ó 200 m relay team of Thorpe, Klim and Todd Pearson to another world record of 7m 7.05s. Kirby's final international competition was at the 2001 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, where along with Klim, Hackett and Thorpe, he lowered the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay world record to 7m 4.66s. That record held firm for nearly six years until United States relay team clocked in at 7m 3.24s at the 2007 World Championships in Melbourne.

His comics were drawn in an expressionistic, primitivist style and usually dealt with grim subject matter such as paranoia, violent crime, and drug abuse. In addition to his own titles, Bogeyman and Cunt Comics, he was published in many of the most prominent comics in the underground scene, including Bijou Funnies and Arcade.

The DS version was released in the United States on December 7, 2005. Reception On Metacritic, the PS2 and Xbox versions have a score of 50 and 58 respectively, each indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews,\\" while the DS version has a score of 49, indicating \\"Generally unfavorable reviews.\\" Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine wrote, \\"If you're a Ford nut, you've got a nice little virtual showroom here, with a competent racing game to boot.\\" Tom Price of Official Xbox Magazine praised the variety of vehicles, stating that it \\"is probably the biggest draw.\\" However, he criticized the sound and outdated graphics. In the U.K., Official Xbox Magazine criticized the soundtrack and wrote that \\"it's not by any means the worst driving game ever made,\\" but stated that \\"much like the Ford brand itself, there isn't really much in the way of glitz or glamour to it either.\\" Douglass C. Perry of IGN reviewed the PS2 and Xbox versions. Perry criticized the graphics and music, and concluded: \\"My first and final impressions of this game? Blech. Ford Racing 3 is not a travesty, but it's not any good either. The best thing that can be said about it is it's filled with 55 Fords. And if you like Fords, well, they're here for you. But I cannot say that you'll have fun or find any kind of thrill driving them, looking at them, or enjoy collecting them, which is kind of the whole point behind this cheap-ass, mediocre, and minimal effort.\\" Scott Alan Marriott of G4TV praised the Xbox version for its graphics and scenic race tracks, as well as its support of Xbox Live, but he criticized the controls, writing that \\"the cars and trucks don't grip the road tightly at all, resulting in a loose style of driving that often feels like you are nudging a boat on water instead of steering radial tires on asphalt.\\" Greg Mueller of GameSpot reviewed the Xbox version and wrote, \\"Despite the license and some interesting gameplay modes, Ford Racing 3 comes off feeling generic and far less distinct than the real-life vehicles the game attempts to capture.\\" Mueller further stated that the game \\"is a passable choice for fans of arcade-style racing because of its forgiving race physics and variety of gameplay modes. However, the game hasn't changed much since the previous installment in the series, and sim fans will be disappointed with the simplistic gameplay and weak vehicle customization options. Additionally, there are already a ton of arcade-style racing games on the market that do all of this better. The game does have some amusing moments, but it's ultimately a forgettable racing experience.\\" Mueller later reviewed the DS version and wrote that \\"while the console versions of Ford Racing 3 have halfway decent racing mechanics and online play, the DS version has neither of these things, and it looks ugly too. The end result is a stiff, lifeless husk of a racing game that will disappoint even the most forgiving of Ford fanatics.\\" IGN reviewed the DS version and felt that it was better than Visual Impact's previous game, Burnout Legends, while writing, \\"Ford Racing 3 is severely mediocre, but still not nearly as bad as some of the racers that hit the Nintendo DS in the past few weeks.\\" David Chapman of GameSpy criticized the Xbox version's outdated graphics, generic sound effects, and wrote, \\"The worst part though has to be the small selection of cheesy rock music that plays over and over until your ears bleed. Thankfully, the Xbox version supports custom soundtracks, so the torture is a short-lived affair.\\" Chapman concluded that the game \\"winds up being a victim of its own mediocrity.\\" Nate Ahearn of TeamXbox praised the gameplay and the option of customizable soundtracks, but criticized the sound effects. GameZone, reviewing the Xbox version, criticized the soundtrack but praised the gameplay and graphics, and concluded, \\"It's a simple, Ford-glorifying collection of racing adventure. It could be better in a lot of ways. There are a lot of faults to this game, but in all it's very playable and does provide some genuine fun.\\" GameZone later wrote about the GBA version, \\"The tracks look great ‚Äî as long as you are not moving, which makes for a boring race! Once you engage in the race itself, your car is a pixilated mess and the scenery comes and goes at random. One moment you are heading towards a barricade, then it disappears‚Ä¶. only to reappear just in time for you to strike it. All along the courses, the scenes change, morph and vanish, which leads to a frustrating and confusing experience.

Tourette syndrome is an inherited neurological disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by the presence of motor and phonic tics. Tourette's is a misunderstood and stigmatizing condition, often mentioned in the popular media. Tourette syndrome was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome. It is no longer considered rare, but is often undetected because of the wide range of severity, with most cases classified as mild. Tourette's is defined as part of a spectrum of tic disorders, which includes provisional and chronic tics.Black, KJ. Tourette Syndrome and Other Tic Disorders. eMedicine (22 March 2006). Retrieved on 7 June 2006. With increased knowledge of the full range of severity of Tourette syndrome‚Äîincluding milder cases‚Äîit has shifted from a condition only recognized in its most severe and impairing forms, to one recognized as a condition which is often mild, and which may be associated with some advantages and some disadvantages. Legal and insurance issues There is no reason to believe that persons with Tourette's have diminished capacity in regards to understanding legal issues. Examples of federal legislation which protects some rights of individuals with TS in the United States include the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Legal and other advocacy information regarding the challenges associated with TS can be found on the website of the Tourette Association of America.Living with TS:Adult Issues. Tourette Syndrome Association. Retrieved 7 October 2013. A review of all cases tried in state and federal courts in the US between 1985 and 2003 (civil rights, criminal, education, family, labor, and social security) found that TS was implicated in only about 150 cases, 21 of which were criminal, over 18 years. The authors concluded that TS \\"rarely leads to criminal behavior, but patients with TS who have behavioral comorbidities are at risk of being involved with the legal system\\". Latent advantages Samuel Johnson (1709‚Äì1784) circa 1772. Johnson published A Dictionary of the English Language in 1755, and was a prolific writer, poet, and critic. Discussions with adults who have Tourette syndrome reveal that not everyone wants treatment or a \\"cure\\", especially if that means they may \\"lose\\" something else in the process. Some believe that there may even be latent advantages associated with the genetic vulnerability.Leckman JF, Cohen DJ. Tourette's Syndrome‚ÄîTics, Obsessions, Compulsions: Developmental Psychopathology and Clinical Care. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1999, p. 408. Research supports some advantages associated with Tourette syndrome. A controlled study on a small (13) group of individuals with TS found that cognitive control may be enhanced in young people with Tourette's because the need to suppress tics results in more efficient control of inhibitions. A subsequent study confirmed and extended the paradoxical result that individuals with Tourette's exhibit greater levels of cognitive control than age-matched healthy peers. There is some evidence to support the clinical lore that children with \\"TS-only\\" (Tourette syndrome in the absence of other comorbid conditions) are unusually gifted: neuropsychological studies have identified advantages in children with TS-only. A study of full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) testing showed that children with TS-only had higher IQ scores, relative to their parents, than predicted by statistical models. Another neurological examination of motor function found that 76% of children with TS-only were faster than average on timed motor coordination, although similar results were not found among children with TS who also had ADHD. In a study of eight children, ages 8‚Äì17, those with Tourette syndrome were found to be much quicker at processing certain mental grammar skills than children without the condition. The abnormalities that lead to tics may also lead to \\"other rapid behaviors, including the cognitive processing of rule- governed forms in language and other types of procedural knowledge\\". The investigator, Michael Ullman, PhD, said, \\"These children were particularly fast, as well as largely accurate, in certain language tasks. This tells us that their cognitive processing may be altered in ways we have only begun to explore, and moreover in a manner that may provide them with performance that is actually enhanced compared [to] that of typically developing children\\". In 2012 the Tourettes awareness project Touretteshero was set up in the UK by Jessica Thom and Matthew Pountney, as a place to \\"celebrate the humour and creativity of Tourettes\\". Notable individuals There are many individuals with Tourette's, living and deceased, recognized in their fields, or for whom obsessive-compulsive tendencies associated with Tourette's may have helped fuel their success. =Samuel Johnson= An example of a person who may have used obsessive-compulsive traits to advantageStein G, Wilkinson G, eds (2007).

Tourette Syndrome Association. Retrieved 10 February 2005. Johnson wrote A Dictionary of the English Language in 1747, and was a prolific writer, poet, and critic. The \\"case of Dr Johnson accords well with current criteria for the Tourette syndrome; he also displayed many of the obsessional-compulsive traits and rituals which are associated with this syndrome\\". According to Boswell, > ... while talking or even musing as he sat in his chair, he commonly held > his head to one side towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous > manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in > the same direction, with the palm of his hand.

The Personal History of Samuel Johnson. New York: Harper > & Row. p. 203. . There are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to act in such a manner at the thresholds of doors, and Frances Reynolds‚Äîyounger sister of artist Joshua Reynolds‚Äîsaid that, \\"with poor Mrs Williams, a blind lady who lived with him, he would quit her hand, or else whirl her about on the steps as he whirled and twisted about to perform his gesticulations\\".Hibbert 1971, p. 202. When asked by English poet Christopher Smart's niece, a young child at the time, why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: \\"From bad habit.\\" Reynold's 1769 portrait depicting Johnson's \\"odd gesticulations\\"Lane, Margaret (1975). Samuel Johnson & His World. New York: Harper & Row Publishers. p. 103. . Johnson had a number of tics and other involuntary movements. In 1994, Pearce analysed the details provided by Boswell and others; based on the anecdotal evidence, Pearce compiled a list of movements and tics which Johnson was said to have demonstrated. From that list, he determined it was possible that Johnson had Tourette syndrome. Pearce was not alone in diagnosing Johnson as having Tourette syndrome; in 1967 McHenry Jr was the first to diagnose Johnson with the syndrome.Wiltshire J (1991). Samuel Johnson in the Medical World. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 29. . It was not until Arthur K. Shapiro's Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome that the diagnosis was made clear, with Shapiro declaring, \\"Samuel Johnson ... is the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome\\".Shapiro AK. (1978). Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. New York: Raven Press. p. 361. . Murray had come to the same conclusion in a 1979 British Medical Journal paper. Murray based his diagnosis on various accounts of Johnson displaying physical tics, \\"involuntary vocalisations\\" and \\"compulsive behaviour\\". In a 2007 analysis, Kammer discussed the \\"documented evidence\\" of Johnson's tics, saying that Johnson was \\"known to have suffered from TS\\". According to neurologist Oliver Sacks, \\"the case for Samuel Johnson having the syndrome, though [...] circumstantial, is extremely strong and, to my mind, entirely convincing\\". He continues by generally describing the \\"enormous spontaneity, antics, and lightning quick wit\\" that featured prominently in Johnson's life. However, Pearce goes further into Johnson's biography and traces particular moments in Johnson's life which reinforced his diagnosis, concluding: > It is not without interest that periodic boundless mental energy, > imaginative outbursts of inventiveness and creativity, are characteristic of > certain Tourette patients. It may be thought that without this illness Dr > Johnson's remarkable literary achievements, the great dictionary, his > philosophical deliberations and his conversations may never have happened; > and Boswell, the author of the greatest of biographies would have been > unknown.

Tourette Syndrome Association Retrieved on 14 August 2002. Letters Mozart wrote to his cousin Maria Anna Thekla (\\"B√§sle\\") between 1777 and 1781 contain scatological language; he wrote canons titled Leck mich im Arsch (\\"Lick my arse\\") or variations thereof (including the pseudo-Latin Difficile lectu mihi mars). While the term \\"Leck mich am Arsch\\", when literally translated, conjures up images of sexual practices, the more accurate English meaning of this phrase is simply \\"Kiss my ass\\". The additional phrase \\"... recht fein sch√∂n sauber\\", while colorful, is still only an emphasis: that is to say, \\"Kiss my ass real good!\\". The use of this written language alone is not necessarily indicative of coprolalia, a rare symptom present in a minority of people with TS, and there are cultural explanations for Mozart's use of language. The German phrase was popularized by the Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749‚Äì1832) drama about the historical figure of G√∂tz von Berlichingen. Coprolalia encompasses words and phrases that are culturally taboo or generally unsuitable for acceptable social use; it is usually expressed out of social or emotional context, and may be spoken in a louder tone or different cadence or pitch than normal conversation. The phrases uttered by a person with coprolalia do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of the person, and are embarrassing to the person uttering them.Cohen, J.E. and Levi-Pearl, S. Understanding Coprolalia - A misunderstood symptom. Available from the Tourette Syndrome Association. Retrieved 30 October 2006. A German psychiatrist examined the question of Mozart's diagnoses and concluded that \\"Tourette‚Äôs syndrome is an inventive but implausible diagnosis in the medical history of Mozart\\". Evidence of motor tics was found lacking and the notion that involuntary vocal tics are transferred to the written form was labeled \\"problematic\\". Neurologist and author Oliver Sacks published an editorial disputing Simkin's claim, and the Tourette Syndrome Association pointed out the speculative nature of this information. No Tourette's syndrome expert or organization has voiced concurrence that there is credible evidence to conclude that Mozart had Tourette's. One TS specialist stated that, \\"although some web sites list Mozart as an individual who had Tourette's and/or OCD, it's not clear from the descriptions of his behavior that he actually had either.\\"Packer, L.

It is spread both vertically and horizontally‚Äîthrough contaminated water and direct contact. Migratory waterfowl are a major factor in the spread of this disease as they are often asymptomatic carriers of disease. The incubation period is three to seven days. Birds as young as one week old can be infected. DEV is not zoonotic. Clinical signs and diagnosis Upon exposure to DEV there is a 3-7 day for domestic fowl and up to a 14 day for wildfowl incubation period for the onset of symptoms. Sudden and persistent increases in flock mortality is often the first observation of DEV. Symptoms in individual birds include loss of appetite, decreased egg production (nearing 20-40% decreases), nasal discharge, increased thirst, diarrhea, ataxia, tremors, a drooped-wing appearance, and in males a prolapsed penis. Mortality rates for DEV may reach 90 percent. Death usually occurs within 5 days after onset of symptoms. The clinical signs of DEV \\"vary with virulence of virus strain, species, sex, and immune system status\\" of the host. Due to the formation of diphtheroid plaques on the eyelids and the mucosae of the respiratory system and gastrointestinal system the bird may show ophthalmic signs and refuse to drink. Blue winged teal can be infected by DEV, but are one of the most susceptible species. Anatid alphaherpesvirus 1 can only infect birds of the family Anatidae of the order Anseriformes, with the possible exception of coots. A study of lesions found in \\"coots (order Gruiformes)\\" found similarities to DEV lesions. This could be evidence that DEV is able to \\"cross to different orders and families\\" or \\"adapted to new hosts.\\" Waterfowl species have differing susceptibility to DEV, with wild fowl tending to be more resistant. Nonwaterfowl have not been shown to be infected by duck plague. Blue-winged teal have been found to be one the most susceptible species and mallards one of the least. In another it took 300,000 more virus material to infect northern pintail than to infect blue-winged teal. Diagnosis can usually be made based on the clinical signs and postmortem findings: On post-mortem, petechial haemorrhage in the conjunctivae, mucous membranes, trachea, syrinx and intestine are pathognomonic for DEV. Diagnosis can also be confirmed with presence of virus inclusion bodies in tissues or a positive immunohistochemical staining for viral antigen.  Epidemiology  DEV is found during the spring seasons across the globe. The United States, Netherlands, and UK have the most occurrences from March to June. Whereas, Southern Hemisphere populations, such as in Brazil, are more likely to have outbreaks November through February during their spring season. If host organisms survive primary infection, they enter a latent stage lasting up to 4 years. Latent stage leads to vertical and horizontal transmission of DEV. Virus particles can be shed by the latent host in shared water or through direct contact (horizontal transmission), contributing to on-going epizootics. There is also evidence of vertical transmission from latent host carriers to their eggs and offspring, which will also be asymptomatic. However, during times of stress AHV-1 may move to nerve roots from nerve ganglia and ‚Äúinduce herpetic lesions‚Äù, a visible symptom of latency carrying. Environmental and physiological cues cause latent carriers to shed viral particles. Examples of physiological cues include \\"stress of migration, breeding season, [and] social interaction.\\" Primary latency sites in carries are the trigeminal ganglion, lymphoid tissue, and blood lymphocytes. The latency sites of APV-1 is similar to other herpesviruses. Treatment and control Vaccination for duck viral enteritis is now routine in the United States. Only attenuated vaccines are efficacious. Once DEV is present, depopulation, relocation and intensive disinfection are required to overcome an outbreak. Solid natural immunity develops in recovered birds. There is no treatment for DEV, but resveratrol has shown to have some antiviral activity against the virus. Management practices such as preventing exposure to wild waterfowl and contaminated water and screening of new stock should be performed to prevent disease.  Pathogenesis  DEV is considered pantropic because it is able to replicate and spread to multiple organs within the host. Viral replication causes an increase in vascular permeability, which leads to the lesions and hemorrhaging of organs, namely the liver, spleen, thymus, and bursa of Fabricius. DVH-1 replicates in the mucus membranes of bird's esophagus and cloaca, the two primary entrances of the virus. The means of infection influences which tissues will be affected first and the incubation time before symptoms show. Typically viral replication begins in the digestive track and moves to bursa of Fabricuis, thymus, spleen, and liver.  Virology  = Classification = Anatid alphaherpesvirus 1 is classified under the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae of the family Herpesviridae in the order Herpesvirales. The genus was identified as Mardivirus. Genomic evidence shows that APV-1 is genetically similar to Human alphaherpesvirus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), Suid alphaherpesvirus 1, Equid alphaherpesvirus 1 and 4 (EHV-1 and EHV-4), and Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BHV-1). = Genome = Anatid alphaherpesvirus 1, similar to other herpesviruses, has a linear double stranded DNA genome. The dsDNA weight is 119√ó106 Daltons and approximately 158,091 base pairs long. AHV-1 has 67 genes in its genome, 65 of which are likely coding genes. Three of the genes have no homologs to other herpesviruses, and are unique to AHV-1. Unique long (UL), unique (US), unique short internal repeat (IRS), and unique short terminal repeat (TRS) regions make up the genome. The genomic arrangement is ordered as UL-IRS-US-TRS. There are 78 predicted proteins encoded by the genome. = Structure = DEV has similar morphology to other Herpesvirales viruses. Common elements of herpviruses include a \\"DNA core, icosahedral capsid, tegument, and envelope.\\" The nucleocapsid of HPV-1 is 75 micrometers wide and the envelope diameter is 181 micrometers. = Replication & transcription cycle = Three phases (immediate early (IE), early (E), and late (L)) of infection dictate the transcription of certain DEV genes. Immediate early begins after infection and before viral DNA replication. During this phase IE genes are transcribed without other proteins. The E genes are also transcribed before viral DNA replication, but are dependent on the IE gene products. After entering the host organism a virion begins the process of replication by first attaching to cells using glycoprotein spikes. gB, gC, gD, gH, and gL are known to be involved. Similar Alphaviruses use gC protein to aid in binding the virion to the cell and gD to stabilize it, if required. gB, gD, gH, and gL proteins allow for fusion of the cell and envelope, and are necessary for survival. Entrance to host cells begins infection, and is largely controlled by the US 2 viral protein. Envelope fusion with the plasma membrane of the host cell causes separation of the nucleocapsid from viral DNA and proteins. Multiple necessary viral proteins are located within the envelope. DNA and proteins enter the host cell nucleus and turn-off host cell synthesis of nucleic acids, proteins, and other macro molecules. There are two hypothesized origins of replication in the IRS and TRS regions of the genome. Immature capsids are formed from coiled DNA. L genes are transcribed \\"after the synthesis of DNA and viral protein onset.\\" Virion DNA maturation occurs as the nucleocapids \\"bud through nuclear membrane.\\" Completed viral replication occurs within 12 hours of infection. Vacuoles of mature virions are formed and released via exocytosis to other cells. Epithelial, lymphocytes, and macrophages are the favored sites of replication in the host organism.  History  The first report of a DEV outbreak was 1923 in the Netherlands. Duck plague was first reported in the United States on Long Island, New York. The outbreak had economically devastating effects on the duck industry. The 1973 Lake Andes, South Dakota DEV outbreak was the another major incidence of the disease in the United States. The outbreak resulted in 43,000 deaths. In 2005 DEV was removed from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) mandatory reporting list due to lack of evidence for international spread and minimal threat to public health. However, there are economic concerns for regions depending on fowl industry, such as India.

The word is derived from Russian word Mormysh () meaning Freshwater Shrimp (Gammarus). Mormyshka was invented in the 19th century in Russia. The prototypes were big spoon lures used for ice fishing. Trying to imitate shrimps, anglers made lures smaller and changed the way of fixing them on the line. As a result, efficient lures appeared and were spread quickly among ice fishermen all around Russia and Scandinavia. Mormyshka consists of a metallic head, often made of tungsten, and a hook soldered in it. There is a small vertical hole in the middle of the head where the line passes through. right The way to knot Mormyshka to the line is unusual, but is not difficult. The line is put through the hole and tied to the hook. When suspended, Mormyshka keeps an almost horizontal position, and the point of the hook is above its shank. Some mormyshkas have a Bead Head on the hook. In contrast to Jig Heads, original Russian Mormyshka jigs have no up eye; Mormyshkas are not always globe-shaped. There are many forms that provide different presentations to fish; Usually, high quality Mormyshka is not painted, but coated or plated with Nickel, Brass, Copper, Gold, Silver, or combination of two metals, that provides better attraction to fish. For the past few years Mormyshka has been used in summer fishing as well with long poles and a float or a nod. It is used either with live bait or alone.

He was educated at the Anglican Church Grammar School. Training at the Australian Institute of Sport, Harrison made his international debut at the 1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Sydney, where he won a silver medal in the 100-metre breaststroke and came fourth in the 200-metre breaststroke. The following year he finished second at the Australian Championships behind Ryan Mitchell, earning himself selection for the Sydney Olympics. At the Olympics, he finished fourth in the 200 m breaststroke, just 0.15 of a second slower than the bronze medal winner. After Australia's only 100-metre breaststroker Phil Rogers put in a poor performance in the individual event, Australian head coach Don Talbot gambled on Harrison to replace Rogers, even though he was not originally selected in the 100-metre breaststroke. Harrison combined with Matt Welsh, Geoff Huegill and Michael Klim to claim silver, behind the United States who broke the world record. At the 2001 Australian Championships, Harrison won gold and silver respectively in the 200-metre and 100-metre breaststroke to qualify for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. He came sixth and 20th in the 200-metre and 100-metre respectively, despite setting an Australian record in the 200-metre event. He combined with Welsh, Huegill and Ian Thorpe to win gold in the 4√ó100-metre medley relay. Harrison had a poor year in 2002, managing only seventh in the 200-metre breaststroke at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, and being dropped for the 100-metre event and the medley relay. He won gold and silver in the 100-metre and 200-metre breaststroke at the 2003 Australian Championships, but continued to decline, finishing outside the top twenty in both events at the 2001 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Spain. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Harrison was eliminated in the heats of the 200-metre breaststroke. He retired after the Games.

Wilks, 490 U.S. 755 (1989), was a U.S. Supreme Court case brought by Robert K. Wilks challenging the validity of race-based hiring practices.. Background In 1974, the Jefferson County, Alabama Personnel Board signed a consent decree that required them to hire and promote African-American firefighters. Wilks, a white fireman, took issue with the agreement, claiming that he and other white firefighters (who were not parties to the original consent decrees signed in 1974) were more qualified than some of the black firefighters receiving promotions. The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the appeal of the white firefighters in a 5-4 decision on the issue of whether the white firefighters have a constitutional right to challenge the previously established decrees. Opinion of the Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote for the majority. They reasoned that a person cannot be denied his rights in a proceeding to which he was not a party. Since the white firefighters did not have valid notice of the original proceeding, they should have their appeal sustained and the decrees overturned. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the dissent, and he was joined by Justice William Brennan, Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Justice Harry Blackmun. The dissent reasoned that the white firefighters should have had only limited means to appeal given that they were challenging the validity of the consent decrees but were not original parties to the consent decrees and that the majority overstepped the authority of the court. Despite the racial overtones of the case and the sensitive public issues of civil rights and affirmative action, the core dispute of the case is one regarding proper procedure. The Court declared that the white firefighters should have been joined as parties to the original proceeding under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 19(a).

It was made available as a free download which was released on the PlayStation Store on December 24, 2006. A Blu-ray Disc version, called \\"Install Disc\\", was released in Japan in limited quantities in September 2007. This game is intended to be a sneak preview, in the likes of Gran Turismo Concept, preceding the release of a full version title, but the Gran Turismo HD project was canceled and replaced by Gran Turismo 5 Prologue. Gameplay Gran Turismo HD Concept includes external view (or rear view) and bumper view, the latter introduces left and right view as seen from the driver's helmet. Left and right views are available with both Sixaxis and steering wheel peripherals although they are not assigned in the wireless controller's default configuration. As a short title, the Concept version only features ten cars ranging from the Suzuki Cappuccino to the Ferrari 599, available in both stock and tuned version, once unlocked. The game's opening movie focuses on Didier Auriol's 1995 Toyota Celica GT-FOUR WRC and the Lotus Elise 111R. The game features only a single track, The Eiger Nordwand (Eiger north face) which is a newly created mountain pass track based on the Kleine Scheidegg and featuring the Swiss Alps' famous M√∂nch and Jungfrau peaks. The track is also available in reverse mode once unlocked. Two play modes are available: Time Trial and Drift Trial. Both modes feature an Internet ranking chart for each continent. Gran Turismo HD Concept is the first game in the franchise to support online ranking. Japanese area ranking ended on September 30, 2007 with the removal of Gran Turismo HD Concept from the local PlayStation Store. The Replay mode is also available, each course's best five records per car in both Time and Drift Trial can be downloaded by users under the form of a replay file. Development At the 2006 Tokyo Game Show's opening, Famitsu released details and a screenshot about a new Polyphony Digital project, Gran Turismo HD, scheduled from a December release. Two versions would be simultaneously released, the Blu-ray Disc based \\"GTHD Premium\\" (GTHD„Éó„É¨„Éü„Ç¢„É†) and the PlayStation Store downloadable \\"GTHD Classic\\" (GTHD„ÇØ„É©„Ç∑„ÉÉ„ÇØ). During the show, Polyphony Digital unveiled the first Gran Turismo HD teaser and featured HD renders of five cars: Nismo GT-R R-Tune R1 '99, Honda S2000 '99, TOM'S Castrol Supra JGTC '99, Ford GT '05 and the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano '06. The first four cars were available in Gran Turismo 4 but didn't appear in late GTHD trailers, though the Ferrari was featured in Gran Turismo HD Concept. Kazunori Yamauchi confirmed the full version of Gran Turismo HD was scheduled for a December 2007 release in Japan. Among the planned contents he introduced an \\"iTunes-like\\" download service and various download packs including additional cars and tracks, advanced AI or car damage, all of which being compatible with the future Gran Turismo 5. The introduction of Ferrari models in the Gran Turismo series was officially announced by the Series producer Kazunori Yamauchi and Giulio Zambeletti from Ferrari on September 28, 2006 at the Paris Motor Show. It was soon followed by a special trailer \\"Gran Turismo HD featuring Ferrari GT cars\\". The first models were supposed to be the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano and the Ferrari F430. While the former was available in Gran Turismo HD Concept, the latter was not, but was included in the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue free playable demo among the non selectable NPC cars. In November 2006, shortly before the release of Gran Turismo HD Concept v2.0, Polyphony Digital director Kazunori Yamauchi officially announced a \\"revision\\" in the \\"product strategy\\": \\"Gran Turismo 5 will be given priority\\". Polyphony Digital chose to abandon the planned full version named Gran Turismo HD, which was previously announced as Vision Gran Turismo at the E3 2005 and was first displayed during the Tokyo Game Show 2006 and was scheduled for a 2007 worldwide release to focus on developing Gran Turismo 5 instead. Kazunori Yamauchi stated \\"Gran Turismo 5 will adopt most of the planned features of Gran Turismo HD\\", which is confirmed by the two \\"Gran Turismo x Skyline\\" trailers based on Gran Turismo 4 replay footages and early Gran Turismo HD Concept artworks or replay footages and including the line \\"Passage to Gran Turismo 5\\". \\"We are hoping to present [...] several Concept versions, each loaded with various experimental features\\", Kazunori Yamauchi added.

In the game's plot, Adam Warlock calls upon Earth's greatest superheroes to seek out the Infinity Gems before they fall into the wrong hands. Although War of the Gems is based on a similar storyline as the Capcom arcade game Marvel Super Heroes, and each of the playable characters retains one of the special moves they had in that game, it is not a port; War of the Gems instead features gameplay similar to Final Fight and X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse. In 2020, the game was rereleased as part of a home arcade cabinet from Arcade1Up alongside X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes.https://www.ign.com/articles/arcade1up-ms-pac-man-marvel-x-men-street- fighter-capcom-cabinets Gameplay Spider-Man fights a Puck doppelganger. The player plays each level as one of five superheroes - Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Wolverine, or Hulk - as they battle through various locations around the globe and even outer space. Each character's health bar is separate and carries over between missions - healing can only be done by picking up items in the levels or using healing items picked up during missions. When a character is defeated, they must be revived individually with the appropriate item. After investigating an area, the player may or may not be rewarded with one of the gems resulting in a restart of the entire game. Only two can be picked up during the first four missions, one is picked up in the following mission upon defeating The Magus, and then two more are randomly received in two of the four following levels. Each character can also select any of the obtained Infinity Gems before stages to obtain gameplay advantages: the Power Gem enables greater attack power; the Time Gem allows for faster movement; the Soul Gem doubles a character's health gauge; the Reality Gem makes extra items visible throughout the stage; and the Space Gem allows for higher jumps. The last gem, Mind, is only received upon defeating Thanos, thus completing the game. Playable characters include: *Captain America: Balanced in both attack and speed, he's the second character to deliver powerful hits, as well as the second bulkiest character (all-around type). *Iron Man: Powerful and fast, can use a variety of projectiles and also has double jump and high speed air attack (all-around type). *Hulk: The biggest character in the game, being the strongest, the slowest, the bulkiest and with the lowest jump height (power type). *Spider-Man: The fastest character in the game, but also the weakest. His attack lasts the longest. His low stance allows him to dodge some attacks without having to crouch. Can climb walls by pressing jump near them (speed type). *Wolverine: A balanced fighter between Spider-Man and Captain America. Much like Spider-Man, he can climb to walls and is relatively small (balanced type). Reception Allgame gave the game a score of 3.5 out of 5.

Gameplay The game was to be set over the course of eight days, and to be set in eight different states, which would have made it the largest game map at the time. The game would have also included a real life clock. If the game was being played at night, it would be night in the game. The player would be able to choose between two characters, one \\"good\\" and one \\"bad\\". In the \\"bad\\" character's storyline, he attempts to get revenge on a mob syndicate. The other storyline would follow the \\"good\\" character, a detective searching for the same mob syndicate, after he kidnaps his son.

Eight Days was being developed by SCE London Studio. The game had a team of 63 development members, which would have been expanded to 80, with an additional 40 outsourced workers. After the production of Eight Days was completed, a bulk of the development team was to begin working on development for The Getaway. Eight Days senior producer Phil James explained in an interview with The Guardian -\\"The idea is to have two pre-production teams and one production team, which flips onto whatever product, at that point of time, is ready to have that team working on it\\". =Trailer= A scene from Eight Days was first shown as an unnamed tech demo during Sony's E3 2005 press conference. The scene showed a gas station exploding. It was used to demonstrate how the PS3's Cell processor would handle visual effects and physics. In March 2006, the game was then shown at SCE's platform keynote as a demo entitled \\"PlayStation 3: Beyond the Box\\". The demo was of a car getting shot at and then exploding. After the bullets hit the engine of the car, the car exploded, causing the wheels to fall off. Eight Days was officially announced in a trailer that was played during Sony's E3 2006 Press Conference. The trailer began with a scene of two men staring at guns inside the trunk of a car. The trailer then cuts to a group of people standing in the Arizona desert. It then cuts to a scene in which passengers in two separate sports cars are shooting at each other. After being shot at, one of the cars flips over, destroying it. The other car arrives at the spot where the group of people were standing. They then engage in a gun battle with the two men from the first scene. The fight continues, and eventually the two men run off as a tanker truck slides and crashes into a diner, causing an explosion. The trailer then cuts to the logo of the game. A final scene after the logo is displayed shows one of the men picking up a lighter from the body of a dead enemy. He then flicks open the lighter and drops it in the gasoline from the tanker. As he walks away an explosion occurs. There was discussion in whether the trailer featured actually in-game footage. Several scenes from the trailer included a full HUD, suggesting that the footage was of real-time gameplay. Patrick Klepek from 1UP.com referred to the footage as having \\"almost too much polish\\" compared to other games that were shown. Alex Navarro from GameSpot also questioned the footage-\\"Certain sequences included a full HUD, but even then, is it too good to be true?\\". Mike Jackson from CVG UK considered the footage to be \\"blatantly pretend in- game CGI\\". Cancellation On 4 June 2008 Sony Computer Entertainment announced that Eight Days, along with The Getaway, had been cancelled. Sony released a statement on the cancellation: \\"This decision was made following an internal review of all games and it was deemed that with the incredibly strong list of exclusive first party titles coming up both this year and in the near future, resource should be reallocated to enhance those projects closer to completion\\". Two weeks after the cancellation of Eight Days, President of Sony Computer Entertainment, Shuhei Yoshida, stated that the lack of an online mode in Eight Days was \\"part of the consideration\\" to cancel the game. He also stated that the cancellation of Eight Days was not because it was failing in production, but because Sony is increasingly moving towards online-supported games, and Eight Days did not fit that overall strategy. However, on October 2009, it was confirmed that the game had not been cancelled, but merely put 'on hold'.\\"Sony London reveals new IP; Getaway 3, Eight Days 'not abandoned'\\". (6 October 2009). GameSpot. Retrieved 28 August 2015. The game was implied to have been cancelled according to an Ex-developer of London Studio, but he also says that Eight Days was still in the pre-production phase at the time and hadn't reached full production.

The route is located primarily in Cedar Rapids and Marion and is known locally as Collins Road. It begins at US 30 / US 218 in western Cedar Rapids and ends at U.S. Highway 151 / Iowa Highway 13 (US 151 / Iowa 13) in Marion. Route description Lindale Mall Iowa 100 begins at a semi-directional T-Interchange with US 30 / US 218 in southwest Cedar Rapids. The road heads northeast along a highway that roughly outlines the western city limits. It crosses the Cedar River about before it intersects with Edgewood Road NE at a single-point urban interchange. The road heads east towards I-380. At I-380, the mainline of Iowa 100 passes high above the interstate. Collector-distributor lanes (C-D lanes) for each highway intersect at an intermediate level between the highways. East of the volleyball interchange, the C-D lanes of Iowa 100 intersect Center Point Road NE before rejoining the mainline at the end of the highway. Continuing east, Iowa 100 passes the Collins Aerospace complex on the north and the studios for KGAN-TV on the south. It enters a shopping district centered around Lindale Mall. Just east of the mall, the highway intersects U.S. Route 151 Business (US 151 Business), which runs along 1st Avenue. South of 1st Avenue, Iowa 100 leaves Cedar Rapids and enters Marion. The highway turns to southeast briefly and then straightens out to the east. It roughly marks the southern extents of Marion as the only neighborhoods lie north of the highway. It continues slightly northeast and then east again and ends at an intersection with US 151 and Iowa 13 on the eastern edge of Marion. History Iowa 100 was designated in the early 1980s after the southern end of Iowa 150 was relocated to Vinton. It originally followed the length of Collins Road NE in Cedar Rapids from I-380 to 1st Avenue. A plan to extend the route west of I-380 to Edgewood road was completed in 1986. In 1996 an extension was constructed eastward, through southern Marion, to US 151 / Iowa 13. Envisioned as 1960s as a bypass of Marion, the route extension served as a development corridor for the city by providing access to its southern limits. Planning for the extension of Iowa 100 from Edgewood Road NE to US 30 / US 218 in western Linn County was seen as controversial. The Linn County Conservation Board noted environmental concerns to areas such as the Rock Island Forest Preserve. Construction nonetheless began in the early 2010s and was completed on December 12, 2018.

Old Maison Blanche building in 1898 Outside the Maison Blanche department store on Canal Street, 1976 Corporate history Maison Blanche was acquired in 1923 by City Stores Company, which merged Maison Blanche with Loveman's in 1950. City Stores Co. filed for bankruptcy in July 1979. While in bankruptcy, they initially intended to consolidate the seven Maison Blanche stores with four B. Lowenstein's stores in Memphis, Tennessee, to form the Maison Blanche Department Stores group, but in early 1982 the Memphis stores were shuttered. Instead, three of the seven existing Maison Blanche stores, as well as the name, were purchased by Goudchaux's, Inc. of Baton Rouge, owned by the Sternberg brothers. (Goudchaux's should not be confused with Godchaux's, a specialty store based in New Orleans). Operating as Goudchaux/Maison Blanche, the new company eventually reopened the original Canal Street flagship in 1984, leasing three floors from the new owners. In the late ‚Äò80s, May Department Stores abandoned Florida by selling 2 chains, which allowed the company to enter the fast-growing Florida market. In 1987, the 10-unit Robinson's of Florida on Florida's Gulf Coast (Tyrone Square Mall, University Square Mall, WestShore Plaza, Countryside Mall, Southgate Plaza, Edison Mall, and Coastland Center) and Orlando (Orlando Fashion Square, Altamonte Mall, and The Florida Mall), plus an 11th at Lakeland Square Mall were sold to them. A year later, they also bought the 5-unit Jacksonville- based \\"May Florida\\" (formerly May Cohens) by taking over 3 Jacksonville stores (Roosevelt Square, Regency Square, and Orange Park Mall), and Volusia Mall in Daytona Beach, while closing the Gateway Mall location. The Goudchaux name was removed and all stores were renamed Maison Blanche. After opening 2 more stores in 1990-one replaced an existing store at Orlando Fashion Square and a 4th in Jacksonville at the brand new Avenues Mall-the number of Florida stores were added to 16. However, both the rapid expansion and the oil-related recession in Louisiana proved to be too much for Maison Blanche to manage. In August 1991, eight stores on Florida‚Äôs Gulf Coast were sold to Dillard's, giving them those locations (Tyrone, University, WestShore, Countryside, Southgate, Edison, Coastland, and Lakeland). This also left MB with 8 stores each in both Louisiana and Florida until Mercantile Stores Inc. purchased the 16-store unit in February 1992, thus converting the rest of their Florida stores to Gayfers, which gained these units (Roosevelt, Regency, Fashion Square, Orange Park, Volusia, Altamonte, Florida, and Avenues).

It was reworked four years later into the popular long-running television series The Dukes of Hazzard, and as such the two productions share many similar concepts. Mitchum had co-starred with his father, Robert Mitchum, in the similar drive-in favorite Thunder Road eighteen years earlier, which also focused upon moonshine-running bootleggers using fast cars to elude federal agents. Moonrunners, a B movie, was filmed in 1973 and awaited release for over a year. Its soundtrack reflects the outlaw music boom of the 1970s during which the film was released. The film was written and directed by Gy Waldron and is based on the life and stories of ex- moonshiner Jerry Rushing, who has a small role in the movie as a heavy at the Boar's Nest bar. It is listed in the book The Greatest Movie Car Chases of All Time. Plot  The story is narrated by the Balladeer (Waylon Jennings), who introduces and comments on the story of cousins, Grady and Bobby Lee Hagg, who run bootleg liquor for their uncle Jesse Hagg of Shiloh County. Uncle Jesse is a Baptist who knows the Bible better than the local preacher. He has been a widower since Aunt Libby died 10 years ago. He still makes liquor, according to his \\"granddaddy's granddaddy's\\" recipe, in stills named Molly and Beulah. Every drop is aged two years, and bottled in glass (never plastic). The Haggs have been making their recipe since before the Revolutionary War, and Jesse only sells to a friend in nearby Florence to ensure that his liquor is never blended with any other. Bobby Lee (also called \\"Lee\\") is a smart-mouthed schemer, named for Confederate General Robert E. Lee. In the opening, Bobby Lee is placed in the Pikkens County jail for a bar fight at the Boar's Nest. On his way home, he helps Beth Ann Eubanks, who is on the run from family trouble in Mississippi. Uncle Jesse lodges her at his home, and Lee courts her. Grady is a laconic \\"Romeo\\" who drives their 1955 Chevrolet stock car (#54, named Traveller after General Lee's horse). It is briefly mentioned that Grady probably has a number of children around Shiloh and Tennessee (in the pilot episode of The Dukes of Hazzard, \\"One Armed Bandits\\", Bo half-jokes that half of the children in the local orphanage could be his cousin Luke's, although this and similar concepts were quickly dropped as the series found its more family-friendly tone). The cousins take Beth to the next race at the local track. The other stock car drivers include \\"good ol' boy\\" Zeebo, and Zeebo's lackey Cooter Pettigrew. Zeebo (driving #31) and Cooter (driving #28) team up to beat Grady in the race, leading to a moonlit bootlegger road race between Bobby Lee and Zeebo. The county boss is Jake Rainey, a friend of Jesse's from the old days when they both bootlegged for Jesse's father in 1934, and owner of the local bar and brothel. Jake has control of all the other moonshine in the county, and sells it to the New York Syndicate (mob). He needs Jesse's supply to fill an order, but Jesse will not sell to Jake since Jake would mix it with lesser quality liquor. To get at Jesse's supply, Jake uses Sheriff Rosco Coltrane, to harass the cousins. At the same time he uses Zeebo, and Reba (Jake's wife who is having an affair with Grady) to goad the boys into a trap. During these events, Uncle Jesse calls Jake \\"hog\\" (effectively making Jake \\"Boss Hogg\\") as a put-down. Uncle Jesse dies after attempting to make a moonshine run. The cousins, who are on probation and cannot own guns, use a bow with explosive arrows to put Jake Rainey's moonshining factory out of business. Cast * James Mitchum as Grady Hagg * Kiel Martin as Bobby Lee Hagg * Arthur Hunnicutt as Uncle Jesse Hagg * Chris Forbes as Beth Ann Eubanks * George Ellis as Jake Rainey * Pete Munro as Zeebo * Joan Blackman as Reba Rainey * Waylon Jennings as the Balladeer * Spanky McFarlane as Precious, Jake's bartender * Joey Giordello as a Syndicate man * Happy Humphery as Tiny, a Syndicate man * Bill Gribble as Cooter Pettigrew * Bruce Atkins as Sheriff Rosco Coltrane * Ben Jones as Agent Fred from Chicago Production Moonrunners was filmed during the fall of 1973 in Williamson and Haralson, Georgia. Many of the original filming locations have changed significantly since the film was produced. A comprehensive photo journal of filming locations as they exist now is part of the Hazzard County Car Club's website. Legacy Several names, places and situations from the film were used in The Dukes of Hazzard with little or no alteration. Waylon Jennings is the Balladeer, and the Boar's Nest is a tavern in both. Although it is toned down for the TV series, the relationship between cousins Bo and Luke Duke is similar to that of Bobby Lee and Grady in Moonrunners. Uncle Jesse is the family patriarch. In both he is a widowed, bearded moonshiner with strong religious beliefs, raising his nephews. They dress similarly, in overalls and a shirt. The film and series feature a corrupt county boss (Jake Rainey and Boss Hogg) who ran moonshine with Uncle Jesse, owns many local businesses and bribes local law enforcement. Their opposing views and Jake's dishonesty make the Haggses and Rainey adversaries, as the Dukes and Boss Hogg were in the series. Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane is a once-honest officer who turned to corruption with the county boss after he was cheated out of his pension. This theme carried over to the end of the first season of the series. Much of the Balladeer's dialogue introducing Rosco in Moonrunners is similar to that in Rosco's first scene in the first episode of The Dukes of Hazzard. In the film and series, the boys have a talented mechanic friend. On probation for running moonshine, they use hunting bows tipped with dynamite since they are forbidden to use firearms. Other names or roles were altered, while retaining recognizable connections. In the film, Uncle Jesse and the boys have the surname Hagg; in the series, their antagonist's surname is Hogg. In Moonrunners, Beth Ann is an honest, naive young woman in trouble who is taken in by the Haggs; the character resembles Daisy Duke, a member of the family. The Haggs' stock car is named Traveller after General Lee's horse, and the Dukes' stock car is named The General Lee. Jake Rainey is said to have organized crime connections, and in early episodes of the TV series Boss Hogg attempts to ally with a syndicate. Uncle Jesse's mule in the film is named Beauregard, a name which would be given to Bo (Beauregard) Duke in the series. These actors appeared in both Moonrunners and The Dukes of Hazzard: * Ben Jones as Fred (a revenue agent) in the film and the Dukes' best friend, Cooter Davenport, in the series * C.

It features previously unreleased material and some remixed songs from Quiet Riot's first two albums which were released only in Japan. These two albums, Quiet Riot and Quiet Riot II, have yet to see any sort of release outside Japan due to the wishes of the Rhoads family.Guitar for the Practicing Musician, December 1993: Rediscovering Randy Rhoads Changes and remixing None of the songs on The Randy Rhoads Years are the same versions that appear on the original two Quiet Riot albums. At the request of the Rhoads family, longtime Quiet Riot vocalist Kevin DuBrow remixed all the tracks, except the previously unreleased \\"Force of Habit\\" as its multitrack master tapes had been lost. Lead vocals were re-recorded on all tracks except \\"Force of Habit\\" by Kevin DuBrow. In one case, he rewrote the lyrics with ex-Rainbow drummer Bobby Rondinelli. This track, \\"Last Call for Rock 'n' Roll\\" was formerly titled \\"Mama's Little Angels\\" on Quiet Riot. The drums on all tracks but \\"Force of Habit\\" were re-sampled, and the guitar tracks were played through Carlos Cavazo's Marshall amplifiers to duplicate the sound that Randy Rhoads achieved in Ozzy Osbourne's band. According to DuBrow, Rhoads was never happy with his guitar tone while in Quiet Riot, but very satisfied with his tone while with Osbourne as he could afford better equipment by then. The song \\"Trouble\\" was sped up as DuBrow felt the original was too slow. DuBrow also added wah-wah to one guitar solo, playing the pedal himself through the original guitar tracks. Again, Rhoads could not afford a wah-wah pedal at the time of recording, but wished he had played the solo with one. \\"Afterglow (Of Your Love)\\" from Quiet Riot II was stripped down, leaving just Rhoads' acoustic guitar in an \\"unplugged\\" arrangement. DuBrow used triangle samples to disguise background noise that could not be removed from the track. The sole live track, \\"Laughing Gas\\", featured an extended guitar solo that was spliced together from two separate recordings. It featured pieces of Rhoads' later songs \\"Goodbye to Romance\\", \\"Dee\\", and perhaps his best known song, the hit \\"Crazy Train\\". It also features parts of the \\"RR\\" solo outtake that was lost and found during the mixing for the 2011 Expanded Legacy Edition for Blizzard of Ozzhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6ejlCB-tkQ and was put on the reissue as a bonus track. The package features only six of the Japanese album tracks in remixed or re-written versions. The rest of those songs remain unreleased outside Japan. The rest of the album is filled out with unreleased songs. Track listing Credits =Quiet Riot= *Kevin DuBrow - lead vocals, triangle, wah-wah *Randy Rhoads - guitars *Kelly Garni - bass *Drew Forsyth - drums =Additional musicians= *Kenny Hillery - bass =Production= *Kevin DuBrow - producer *Lee DeCarlo - producer *Warren Entner - producer *Derek Lawrence - producer Sequel album and home video At the time of release of The Randy Rhoads Years, DuBrow said in the 1993 interview with Guitar for the Practicing Musician that two more releases were forthcoming. He mentioned a second volume featuring more remixed and unreleased tracks, including Quiet Riot's version of \\"Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)\\". According to DuBrow, the release of any further tracks completely depended on their quality, and approval by the Rhoads family. He also said a home video release was forthcoming of an early Quiet Riot club show featuring Rhoads. This same video provided the audio for one half of the live version of \\"Laughing Gas\\" on The Randy Rhoads Years. To date, neither of these releases have seen the light of day; DuBrow had championed the release of the Rhoads material, and his 2007 death makes the release of any further Rhoads material unlikely.

It was first developed under the name King of Sumeria or The Sumer Game by Doug Dyment in 1968 at Digital Equipment Corporation as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round, feeding their people, and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. The Sumer Game was inspired by The Sumerian Game, a much more in-depth text-based economic simulation intended for children, developed from 1964 to 1966 by designer and elementary school teacher Mabel Addis and IBM programmer William McKay. Multiple versions of the game were created for the FOCAL language, but around 1971 David H. Ahl ported it to DEC BASIC and in 1973 published it in 101 BASIC Games. This was later republished in Microsoft BASIC form in 1978's BASIC Computer Games. His expanded version of the game, titled Hamurabi, quickly became the more prominent version due to the popularity of both the book and the programming language. Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is also an antecedent to the city-building genre. Gameplay Hamurabi is a text-based strategy video game centered on resource management in which the player, identified in the text as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, enters numbers in response to questions posed by the game. The resources that the player must manage are people, acres of land, and bushels of grain. These are managed over the course of ten rounds, each of which represents a year. Each person can farm a set amount of land, which produces grain. Grain, in turn, can be used to feed people, who otherwise die the following round, or planted for the following year's crop. The player may also buy or sell land to their neighbors each turn in exchange for grain. Each round begins with an adviser stating \\"Hamurabi: I beg to report to you\\" the current status of the city, including the prior year's harvest and change in population, followed by a series of questions as to how many bushels of grain to spend on land, seeds, and feeding the people. The game's variations are driven by random numbers: the price of land is randomly decided each round from between 17 and 26 bushels per acre, the amount of bushels generated each round is randomly decided, random amounts of bushels are eaten by rats, and new people come to the city each year in random amounts. Each year also presents the possibility of a plague reducing the population by half. The game ends after ten rounds, or earlier if the entire population of the city dies or at least 45 percent of the people starve in a single round. The end-game appraisal, added in the 1973 version of the game, compares the player to historical rulers‚Äîsuch as \\"Your heavy-handed performance smacks of Nero and Ivan IV.\\" Development In 1962, Westchester County, New York and IBM began studying the use of computers in education, using a grant from the U.S. Office of Education to produce \\"economic games\\" for sixth-grade students. One, The Sumerian Game (1964), was a model of ancient Sumerian civilization, written and designed by elementary- school teacher Mabel Addis and programmed by William McKay of IBM. The early mainframe game, set in 3500 B.C., has players act as rulers of the city of Lagash. In 1966 Addis revised the game and interspersed it with cutscenes of taped audio lectures and slide projector images. DEC PDP-8 minicomputer In 1968, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) employee Richard Merrill invented the FOCAL programming language. Fellow employee Doug Dyment heard a description of The Sumerian Game after a talk at the University of Alberta, and as an early program for the language developed King of Sumeria, programming it for a DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. The game is sometimes erroneously attributed to Merrill in 1969, but 1969 and 1973 program catalogs by the Digital Equipment Computer Users Society (DECUS) list Dyment as the original developer, though they also renamed it to The Sumer Game. The game was originally described as: \\"This is a simulation program/game which will run on a minimal PDP-8 system. The economy of a Sumerian city in the year 3000 B. C. is simulated in the fashion of a modern-day 'business game.'\\" \\"Business games\\" were text-based business management simulation games, such as The Management Game, which was used in business schools such as at Carnegie Mellon University since at least 1958. By 1961, there were over 89 different business and economic simulation games in use, with various graphical capabilities. The final game was, according to Dyment, \\"the largest piece of FOCAL-8 code that could fit in a 4K machine: there was literally not room for a single extra character\\". As a result, the game uses shortened forms for much of the text, including spelling the player-controlled ruler, changed from Luduga to the Babylonian king Hammurabi, as \\"Hamurabi\\". Multiple versions of The Sumer Game were created. Jerry Pournelle recalled in 1989 that \\"half the people I know wrote a Hammurabi program back in the 1970s; for many, it was the first program they'd ever written in their lives\\". The 1973 DECUS catalog additionally lists a French-language version by Belgians J. F. Champarnaud and F. H. Bostem for the FOCAL-69 version of the language, and a 1978 catalog adds Ruben by James R. B. Howard II and Jimmie B. Fletcher, \\"a modification of the \\"King of Sumeria\\" game\\" with additional features. The French version of the game, however, despite being listed as \\"Sumer (French)\\", described itself not as a translation of the original game, but as a translation of \\"Hamurabi (The Sumer Game)\\", due to another version of the game which was already released by then. Around 1971, DEC employee David H. Ahl had written a version of The Sumer Game in the BASIC programming language. Unlike FOCAL, BASIC was run not just on mainframe computers and minicomputers, but also on personal computers, then termed microcomputers, making it a much more popular language. In 1973, Ahl published BASIC Computer Games, a best-selling book of games written in BASIC, which included his version of The Sumer Game. The expanded version was renamed Hamurabi and added an end-of-game performance appraisal. The popularity of both the book and the programming language itself meant that Ahl's version of the game became the more widely known version over the relatively obscure original, as evidenced by the 1973 French FOCAL version considering \\"Hamurabi\\" to be the more prominent name. BASIC Computer Games noted that the game was a modification of a game \\"written in FOCAL at DEC\\", but listed the author as \\"unknown\\". The 1978 edition of the book, which was the first million-selling computer book, noted that the game's name was intended to be \\"Hammurabi\\", but not only was one \\"m\\" dropped in the file name to fit in an eight-character limit, but Ahl consistently misspelled the name inside of the game, following Dyment's spelling, leading to the generally accepted name of the game to be Hamurabi. Legacy In addition to the multiple versions of Hamurabi, several simulation games have been created as expansions of the core game. These include Kingdom (1974) by Lee Schneider and Todd Voros, which was then expanded to Dukedom (1976). Other derivations include King (1978) by James A. Storer, and Santa Paravia en Fiumaccio (1978) by George Blank; Santa Paravia added the concept of city building management to the basic structure of Hamurabi, making it an antecedent to the city- building genre as well as an early strategy game. A conversion of this game was included on the BBC Micro's Welcome Tape and Welcome Disc as Yellow River Kingdom (1981). Hamurabi inspired more complicated economic simulation games; M.U.L.E. (1983) and Anacreon (1987) are two games that critics mentioned as being similar to Hamurabi.

Biography Harry Adriance was born on October 27, 1864 in Oswego, New York. At the age of 33, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in Boston, Massachusetts on June 15, 1898. He served at Marine Barracks, New York Navy Yard and then was transferred to the U.S. Naval Base, Cavite, Philippine Islands, arriving there on September 21, 1899. He was among the Marines sent to the city of Tientsin on June 29, 1900 at the outbreak of hostilities by the Boxers in China. Two weeks after arriving in China, Cpl Adriance distinguished himself by meritorious conduct during the battle near Tientsin. He served with the China Relief Expedition until October 10, 1900. On March 24, 1902, Cpl Adriance was presented the Medal of Honor for his actions on July 13, 1900. Corporal Adriance returned to Cavite after his tour in China ended and then was transferred to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York on July 20, 1902. He was discharged there at the rank of sergeant on June 19, 1903. Three weeks later, Sgt Adriance re-enlisted in Buffalo, New York. A contested court-martial approximately one year later regarding theft charges resulted in Sgt Adriance receiving a bad conduct discharge from the Marine Corps and a reduction in rank to private on September 7, 1904. Adriance died in a Coney Island, New York, hospital on January 25, 1934, at the age of 70 from gallstones and jaundice. Records indicate he was cremated, and his ashes given to his wife. In the late 1980s, the Marine Corps League in his hometown of Oswego initiated proceedings in an attempt to upgrade Pvt Adriance's discharge. The outcome is unknown.

The publication began as the Football Record in Melbourne, Australia in 1912, making it one of the oldest magazines in Australia. The publication is also known affectionately by fans as the Footy Record and many other leagues have since adopted a similar format and produce their own \\"footy record\\". The AFL Record, in its current format, is published and produced by AFL Media, the AFL's media platform which produces and provides content for the official AFL website (AFL.com.au) and the AFL App. As of 2018, the editor of the AFL Record is Michael Lovett. In July, 2018, the AFL sold the AFL Record and its related products to Crocmedia in an $8.1 million deal. The sports media company will take over all weekly match-day magazine content, including the AFL Record, AFLW publications, the AFL Season Guide and AFL Grand Final edition. History The publication began as the Football Record in Melbourne, Australia on 27 April 1912, making it one of the oldest magazines in Australia. It was initially formatted as a pocketbook guide to assist spectators of matches when the league was known as the VFL. The guide helped identify players on the field. As only their numbers were worn on their guernseys, the record contained a list of player names so that spectators could tell who is who. Over time, the record included a section for keeping track of how many goals and behinds players have kicked while the game is being played and this became a traditional pastime of many footy spectators, something which is fairly unusual to the game. Special interest articles were also added, as well as scores, reports and updates from other leagues around the country. The AFL Record was known as the Football Record until 1998, and in 1999 the current title was adopted. Today's Record Today's official AFL Record is published in a sports magazine style format. Nine different versions (one for each game) are published for each weekly round (60,000 copies in total) and Roy Morgan Research estimated in 2014 that the Record has a weekly readership of over 200,000. To reduce costs, the format for the record changed in the 1990s with the advent of the national league to include an outer magazine which covers regular columns and stories about the entire league and an insert with specifics on the current game such as teamsheets and scoresheets. With the advent of themed rounds in the AFL, the Record is often themed accordingly, with issues such as \\"Women's round\\", for example, containing articles about women's involvement in the game. Many themed rounds are repeated annually, such as the ANZAC Day edition, Hall of Fame, Derby Day, Showdown, Indigenous or \\"Dreamtime\\" round, the \\"Big Freeze\\", and Maddy's Round. In addition, players who reach a milestone of 250, 300 or 350 AFL games are typically honoured with a front cover and a feature story. The Grand Final Record is typically more expensive and has significantly more content. It is distributed in newsagents, available the Monday prior to the Grand Final (the \\"News Stand Edition\\") as well as at the game (the \\"Match Day Edition\\"). These were discontinued after a time. As of 2009, the week's records are now published and are able to be viewed in an \\"online magazine\\" format. In late March 2020, following the COVID-19 lockdowns and as crowds were no longer permitted to attend AFL matches, Crocmedia began publishing a digital version of the Record. They were also sold in newsagents in Victoria.

NY 362 was assigned to its current routing as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Route description NY 362 through the hamlet of Bliss, as seen from old NY 39 NY 362 begins at an intersection with NY 39 in the hamlet of Bliss, located within the town of Eagle. The route heads north through the community as a two-lane road, traversing several residential blocks ahead of a junction with Main Street (County Route 58). Past this junction, NY 362 turns northwest and heads under an abandoned railroad overpass as it leaves Bliss for less developed areas of the town of Eagle. Outside of Bliss, the highway gradually turns to the north, serving a handful of scattered residences located in otherwise open and rolling terrain in the northern part of the town. NY 362 eventually crosses into the town of Wethersfield, where the homes gradually give way to large cultivated fields ahead of the route's end at a rural junction with NY 78. History On April 27, 1911, the state of New York awarded a contract to rebuild all of what is now NY 362\\\\.

Consequently, whosoever owns that piece of land will also own the things attached. Another way to look at it is by interpreting the Latin principle as 'that which is attached to the land becomes a part of the land'; use of the word soil is a more literal translation. An old fireplace in East Hampton, 1872 The key issue is the degree of permanence a purported fixture has to the piece of land in question. An antique fireplace set into a house's living room wall has a high degree of permanence and would therefore benefit from the principle. Conversely, if that same fireplace has ornaments loosely attached to the floor at either end, those ornaments would be very unlikely to benefit from the principle. However, if those same ornaments were bolted to the floor, they would almost certainly pass the principle's test. The purpose of the principle is to ensure that a purchaser of land does not acquire title or ownership of something which is not intended to pass with the land. The principle also ensures that correct title does pass to a purchaser in the event that a previous owner attempts to assert that a fixture was a chattel and therefore belonged to them. The principle has particular relevance to landlord and tenant law. If a tenant is coming close to the end of his or her agreement and aims to remove a particular item attached to the landlord's property, the principle exists to remedy this.

Harry Stine, written under the nom de plume Lee Correy. First appearing as a four-part serial in Analog magazine between December 1980 and March 1981, the novel was later published by Ballantine/Del Rey in 1981, with a second edition following in 1985. The book can best be described as an early form of the techno-thriller genre, later popularized by authors such as Tom Clancy. Plot summary In the book, the Space Shuttle Atlantis launches on a polar orbit flight from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Southern California. During the launch, the main engines cut off prematurely and the Shuttle is forced to make an emergency landing on Rapa Nui, better known to most of the world as Easter Island. Landing is just the start of the problems for NASA, who now have to deal with the immense technological challenge of getting the Shuttle back home. Problems include lack of documents for the astronauts and shuttle, bringing in the crane that's used to lift the Shuttle onto the specially modified 747 that carries it, widening the runway to accommodate the 747, building turn-arounds on the runway so that it can turn and take off again, bringing in fuel for the plane and many, many other problems. A subplot involves efforts by the Soviet Union to take the Shuttle for themselves.

Rhino would defeat all-comers including Teddy Hart who would start a quest for the JAPW Heavyweight Championship. He would unsuccessfully challenge for the title by losing to Rhino. But due to Rhino no-showing an event, he was subsequently stripped of the title. This left the door open for a new champion to be crowned. Then on November 28, 2006, Hart's quest would come to an end when he defeated Low Ki and Necro Butcher in a triple threat match to win the vacant JAPW Heavyweight Championship. Teddy Hart's title reign would come to an end just under three months later when he would be stripped of the title upon release from the company.

It is not present in the vocal cords of the larynx, or the oropharynx and laryngopharynx, where instead the epithelium is stratified squamous. It also functions as a barrier to potential pathogens and foreign particles, preventing infection and tissue injury by the secretion of mucus and the action of mucociliary clearance.  Structure Pseudostratified columnar epithelium, animated image highlights the epithelial cells, goblet cells, then underlying connective tissue Cells of the respiratory epithelium. Basal cells shown in purple, ciliated cells shown in brown, goblet cells shown in green, and submucosal gland shown in blue. The respiratory epithelium lining the upper respiratory airways is classified as ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium.Mescher AL, \\"Chapter 17. The Respiratory System\\" (Chapter). Mescher AL: Junqueira's Basic Histology: Text & Atlas, 12e: . This designation is due to the arrangement of the multiple cell types composing the respiratory epithelium. While all cells make contact with the basement membrane and are, therefore, a single layer of cells, the nuclei are not aligned in the same plane. Hence, it appears as though several layers of cells are present and the epithelium is called pseudostratified (falsely layered). The respiratory mucosa transitions to simple cuboidal epithelium and finally to simple squamous epithelium in the alveolar ducts and alveoli. =Cells= The cells in the respiratory epithelium are of four main types: a) ciliated cells, b) goblet cells, c) club cells, and d) airway basal cells. Goblet cells become increasingly fewer further down the respiratory tree until they are absent in the terminal bronchioles; club cells take over their role to some extent here. Another important cell type is the pulmonary neuroendocrine cell. These are innervated cells that only make up around 0.5% of the respiratory epithelial cells. The ciliated cells are columnar epithelial cells with specialized ciliary modifications. The ciliated cells make up between 50 and 80 per cent of the epithelium. Between the ciliated cells are numerous microvilli, attached as tufts to brush cells sometimes referred to as pulmonary brush cells; these are also known as the tuft cells of the gastrointestinal tract, or intestinal tuft cells, although there is a difference between the two types: the brush cells lack the terminal web that lies under the microvilli of the tuft cells. Their function is unknown but their locations particularly at the alveoli suggest a clearance role. Function The respiratory epithelium functions to moisten and protect the airways. It acts as a physical barrier to pathogens, as well as their removal in the mechanism of mucociliary clearance. The ciliated cells are the primary components in the mucociliary clearance mechanism. Each epithelial cell has around 200 cilia that beat constantly at a rate of between 10 and 20 times per second. The direction of their beat is targeted towards the pharynx, either upwards from the lower respiratory tract or downwards from the nasal structures. Goblet cells, so named because they are shaped like a wine goblet, are columnar epithelial cells that contain membrane-bound mucous granules and secrete mucus as part of the airway surface liquid (ASL), also known as the epithelial lining fluid, the composition of which is tightly regulated; the mucus helps maintain epithelial moisture and traps particulate material and pathogens moving through the airway. and determines how well mucociliary clearance works.Stanke F The Contribution of the Airway Epithelial Cell to Host Defense. Mediators Inflamm. 2015;2015:463016. PMC 4491388U.S. EPA. Integrated Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen ‚Äì Health Criteria (2016 Final Report).

The basal cells are small, nearly cuboidal that differentiate into the other cell types found within the epithelium. Basal cells respond to injury of the airway epithelium, migrating to cover a site denuded of differentiated epithelial cells, and subsequently differentiating to restore a healthy epithelial cell layer. The differentiated epithelial cells can also dedifferentiate into stem cells and contribute to the repairing of the barrier. Club cells carry out similar functions in the more distal airways. Certain parts of the respiratory tract, such as the oropharynx, are also subject to the abrasive swallowing of food. To prevent the destruction of the epithelium in these areas, it changes to stratified squamous epithelium, which is better suited to the constant sloughing and abrasion. The squamous layer of the oropharynx is continuous with the esophagus. The respiratory epithelium has a further role of immunity for the lungs - that of glucose homeostasis. The glucose concentration in the airway surface liquid is held at a level of around 12 times lower than that of the blood sugar concentration. The tight junctions act as a barrier that restricts the passage of glucose across the epithelium into the airway lumen. Some glucose passes through, where it diffuses into the airway surface liquid to be kept at its reduced level by pulmonary glucose transport, and metabolism. However, airway inflammation decreases the effectiveness of the tight junctions making the barrier more permeable to glucose. Higher levels of glucose promote the proliferation of bacteria by providing glucose as a source for carbon for them. Increased levels of glucose in the airway surface liquid is associated with respiratory diseases, and hyperglycemia. Clinical significance Long-term irritation of the epithelial cells can cause the overproduction of mucus, known as mucus hypersecretion. Mucus hypersecretion results in the productive cough of chronic bronchitis. Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells have been associated with a range of chronic lung disorders. They are also the originating cells of small-cell lung cancer.

City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994), more commonly Dolan v. Tigard, is a United States Supreme Court case.. It is a landmark case regarding the practice of zoning and property rights, and has served to establish limits on the ability of cities and other government agencies to use zoning and land-use regulations to compel property owners to make unrelated public improvements as a condition to getting zoning approval. Facts Bike path at issue Petitioner Dolan, owner and operator of A-Boy Plumbing & Electrical Supply store in the city of Tigard, Oregon, applied for a permit to expand the store and pave the parking lot of her store. The city planning commission granted conditional approval, dependent on Dolan dedicating land to a public greenway along an adjacent creek, and developing a pedestrian and bicycle pathway in order to relieve traffic congestion. The decision was appealed to the Oregon State Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA), alleging that the land dedication requirements were not related to the proposed development, and thus constituted an uncompensated taking of her property, which is disallowed by the Fifth Amendment. LUBA found a reasonable relationship between the development and both conditions of the variance, as the larger building and paved lot would increase runoff into the creek, and the impact of increased traffic justified the requirement for a pathway. The decision was subsequently affirmed by the Oregon State Court of Appeals and the Oregon Supreme Court. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Decision The Supreme Court overturned the state Land Use Board of Appeals and the Oregon appellate courts. The Court held that under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, a government agency may not require a person to surrender constitutional rights in exchange for discretionary benefits, where the property sought has little or no relationship to the benefit conferred. A two-prong test was applied: Whether or not there is an \\"essential nexus\\" between the permit conditions and legitimate state interest, and whether or not the degree of the exactions required by the permit condition bears the required relationship to the projected impact of the proposed development. The Court held that the first condition had been satisfied. However, the Court ruled that the City failed to make an individualized determination that the required dedications are related, in both nature and extent, to the proposed impact. Further, the Court held that the requirement for a public greenway (as opposed to a private one, to which Dolan would retain other rights of property owners, such as the right of exclusive access), was excessive, and that the City failed to meet its burden of establishing that the proposed pathway was necessary to offset the increased traffic which would be caused by the proposed expansion.

When Angie learns that Full intends to turn the bag over to the medical establishment for the good of humanity, she grabs it and tries to leave. In the ensuing scuffle, the instruments spill out. Without thinking, Angie stabs Full with a scalpel, killing him. Initially shocked, she quickly recovers and disposes of the body using a small incinerating device used for tumors. Full had taught Angie how to use the kit and allowed her to practice with its contents, so she sees no obstacle to continuing to treat rich patients. Her first patient sees the sharp instruments and balks at the prospect of surgery. To reassure her, Angie demonstrates their safety by running a scalpel through her arm without harm. Still unconvinced, the client requests another test. Back in the future, a technician notes the bag has been used for murder and deactivates its advanced functions. Angie runs what has just become an ordinary scalpel across her own throat, with fatal results. References External links * Category:1950 short stories Category:Short stories by Cyril M.

Work on what would become the Skeeter had been commenced by the Cierva Autogiro Company as the Cierva W.14. Following Saunders-Roe's takeover of Cierva, it was decided to continue its projects, including the Skeeter. Despite an initial preference for the rival Fairey Ultra-light Helicopter, which had already been ordered, there was a reversal of fortune with interest from the Bundeswehr in the potential procurement of a large number of Skeeters. This led to the British order for the Ultra-light Helicopter being cancelled and the Skeeter effectively taking its place, which also served to guarantee an export order from Germany. During the late 1950s, the Skeeter entered service with the British Army Air Corps, the German Navy, and the German Army. It has the distinction of being the first helicopter to be used by the Army Air Corps. While some consideration had been made to developing a version of the Skeeter powered by a turbine engine instead of a piston engine, it was decided to produce the developmental Saro P.531 for this purpose instead of a more direct Skeeter derivative. Development =Origins= In 1947, the Cierva Autogiro Company commenced work on a new project, which was designated as the W.14 Skeeter. As designed, it was a relatively compact two-seat helicopter, intended to be suitable for use as both a civilian aircraft and for aerial observation duties with military customers. The original engine selected to power the Skeeter was a single 110 hp Jameson FF-1 air-cooled horizontally-opposed piston engine. On 10 October 1948, the first prototype Skeeter performed its maiden flight at Eastleigh airfield. Initial flight trials of the prototype proved the rotorcraft to be underpowered, which was partially as a result of the experimental Jameson engine being prone to overheating. In response, the company decided to develop an improved Mark 2 Skeeter which was to be equipped with the well-established de Havilland Gipsy Major 10, which proveded 145 hp (108 kW).London 1988, p. 239. The Mark 2 Skeeter was a noticeably larger aircraft and had a different appearance. On 20 October 1949, the larger Skeeter Mark 2 performed its first flight. Powered tests using the rotorcraft soon made it apparent that the Mark 2 suffered from severe ground resonance problems. Cierva found it difficult to resolve these issues; on 26 June 1950, the Skeeter Mark 2 was destroyed during ground testing. Despite these problems, Cierva had received an order from the British Ministry of Supply for three improved Skeeters, a pair of Mark 3s and a single Mark 4, for evaluation purposes by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy.London Air Enthusiast 1994, p. 3. Prior to the completion of any of these three rotorcraft, rival manufacturer Saunders-Roe completed its take over of Cierva and took control of its facilities and development programmes in January 1951. During March 1953, the Blackburn Bombardier-engined Skeeter Mark 3B was transferred to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;). Subsequent testing showed that these aircraft continued to be underpowered and that the previously encountered ground resonance problems had yet to be properly resolved; these failings were cited as the reason for official support for the rotorcraft being suspended. In response to the suspension, Saunders-Roe chose to undertake a lengthy series of company-funded tests, which involved the use of a specially-built rig as well as more theoretical work being performed, for the purpose of identifying both the causes of and solutions to the resonance issue.London 1988, pp. 239‚Äì242. 1962 Saunders-Roe Skeeter AOP12. Kept in non- flying condition at the Army Flying Museum in Hampshire, England. =Competition and reversal of fate= During the early 1950s, the British Army became highly interested in the potential use of compact helicopters in the observation and aerial observation roles.Wood 1975, p. 111. In 1953, there was a requirement issued by the British Ministry of Supply which sought for a low-cost two-seat helicopter, which would be suitable for reconnaissance, casualty evacuation and training duties. This specification was considered to be quite demanding, calling for it to be capable of high speeds and quick climb rates even under tropical conditions. The rotorcraft was also required to be transportable on the back of a standard Army three-ton truck, constricting the dimensions of the prospective vehicle considerably. Further requirements for the prospective light helicopter included a flight endurance of one hour along with the potential for carrying light cargos such as fuel and tools as well as stretcher-bound wounded troops. An initial request for a rear-facing observer's seat was present early on, but was discarded in later revisions. At this time, newly developed gas turbines were beginning to appeal both to helicopter designers and to prospective operators, the British Army made the use of such an engine one of its requirements. A diverse range of entries were submitted in response to the issuing of the requirement; amongst these were Fairey Aviation with its Ultra-light Helicopter which harnessed tip jet propulsion, Saunders-Roe with a smaller version of the Skeeter, the Bristol Aeroplane Company's proposed Type 190, a ducted rotor proposal by Percival Aircraft, Short Brothers proposed the larger Short SB.8, and a ram jet-powered proposal by Austrian-born helicopter pioneer Raoul Hafner.Wood 1975, pp. 111‚Äì112. In response to the detailed design submission that Fairey had produced for their proposal, the Ministry decided to award the firm a contract to produce a total of four development aircraft for demonstration and flight testing purposes; the company later decided to construct a further two more rotorcraft as a private venture. Meanwhile, a solution for the Skeeter's troublesome resonance issue had been developed, which involved the adoption of a redesigned undercarriage and the fitting of revised blade friction dampers on the rotor head. These improvements allowed Saunders-Roe to finally demonstrate that the ground resonance problems had been fixed when the Skeeter Mark 5 underwent testing by the A&AEE; in March 1954.Flight 1956, p. 355. The resolution of the issue served to reignite official interest in the rotorcraft, quickly leading to a smaller order being placed for four Skeeter Mark 6s, each equipped with 200 hp (149 kW) Gipsy Major 200 engines (designated as AOP.10 and T.11 by the British armed forces), for evaluation purposes. It was around this point that the British Army became more focused on the Skeeter and the addressing of its shortcomings, while the Fairey Ultra- light fell out of favour.Wood 1975, p. 115. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the Skeeter had benefitted from a favourable early impression of the type that had been made upon some West German officials; the rotorcraft had attracted the offer of a sizable military order from the German government, however, the placing of the order was on the condition that the Skeeter was in turn adopted by the British armed forces as well. Thus, the decision was taken in Whitehall to concentrate its efforts on the Skeeter, which effectively meant the abandonment of the Ministry requirement that the rival Fairey Ultra- light had been being developed towards fulfilling. In 1956, Saunders-Roe finally received production orders for 64 AOP.12s, each powered by a215 hp (160 kW) engine; production deliveries of the Skeeter commenced in 1958.London 1988, pp. 245‚Äì249.London Air Enthusiast 1994, pp. 4‚Äì5. Design The Saunders-Roe Skeeter is a light all-metal, two-seat single-rotor helicopter, complete with a tail rotor for torque compensation and yaw control.Flight 1956, p. 356. It was intended to perform as an all-purpose rotorcraft, primarily being used for light civil work as well as aerial observation and training missions in military service. The handling characteristics were broadly similar to comparably-sized rotorcraft of the era, while possessing the necessary simplicity, robustness, and reliability that commonly typified trainer aircraft. The Skeeter possessed a relatively conventional configuration for a helicopter, being powered by a single piston engine which drove a 29-foot (8.84 metre) three-bladed main rotor and a three-bladed anti- torque rotor, which was mounted at the end of a triangular-section tailboom. The main rotor-blades made used of a composite construction, using a steel- tube spar that was bonded to wooden veneers, formers, and ribs, as well as brass balance-weights; these reportedly delivered a cost-effective and relatively simplistic rotor blade that also possessed favourable fatigue properties. Saunders-Roe also developed a replacement metal light alloy rotor blade that possessed superior aerodynamic properties and provided increased performance. A fixed tricycle undercarriage arrangement, complete with interchangeable wheels and brake units, was also present.London 1988, pp. 237, 239.Flight 21 October 1948, pp. 477‚Äì478. The Skeeter's crew of two were housed within an enclosed glazed perspex canopy, complete with removable doors. The design of the cabin had been heavily shaped by the requirement for the Skeeter to be suited to the air observation post (AOP) role that the type had been heavily marketed towards. The nose structure of the Skeeter bore the weight of the rotorcraft's equipment, payload, and crew in addition to the inertial forces present during manoeuvring and landing loads from the nose wheel. The light-alloy structure contained control access panels in the floor and a battery unit within the nose itself.Flight 1956, p. 357. Directly behind the cockpit and underneath the main rotor was the rotorcraft's engine and its nylon bag-type fuel tank, which was housed within a welded tubular steel framework attached to the cockpit structure and to the tailboom. Power was directed to the tail rotor via a torque shaft contained within the tail cone, which featured gearing so that pilots could readily adjust the speed and direction of tail rotor movement. The engine was provided with cooling air via an intake on the centre of the starboard side of the rotorcraft; for improved ventilation, the cowling around the engine area could be entirely removed. The de Havilland Gipsy Major that was used to power the majority of Skeeters was credited with being a major contributor to the rotorcraft's relatively high fuel efficiency due to its use of fuel injectors (the high aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe itself was another beneficial factor).Flight 1956, pp. 356‚Äì357. =Rocket-boosted rotor= With the limited power of the Gipsy Major, means of boosting power were investigated, including a de Havilland developed turbo-supercharger. As an alternative to the turbocharger, a rocket powered rotor boost system was developed by D. Napier & Son, fuelled by High Test Peroxide (HTP) decomposed at blade tip nozzles by contact with a catalyst. The Napier N.R.E. 19 system was fitted to two Skeeter 6 helicopters (G-AMTZ and G-ANMI), re-designated as Skeeter 6 (mod) when modified. The rocket system consisted of a hemispherical HTP tank on the top of the rotor head and pipes running through the blades to catalyst chambers and rocket nozzles at each blade tip. Total thrust was thrust for 15 minutes, at a total HTP consumption rate of , boosting rotor power by and increasing vertical climb rate considerably . Total weight of the system was under . Flight trials proved the system to work as advertised but it was rejected due to the logistical problems involved with HTP in peace-time and particularly during military action. Operational history The British Army ordered 64 Skeeter 6's, to be designated as the Skeeter AOP.12 (Air Observation Post - artillery direction & control), and the Skeeter finally entered service in October 1956. Several Skeeter AOP.12s were operated by the Central Flying School of the Royal Air Force. With the merger of the helicopter activities of the British Bristol Aeroplane Company, Fairey and Saro with Westland Aircraft in 1960, plans to develop a turbine powered version were abandoned ‚Äì although this knowledge was used in the development of the Westland Scout and Westland Wasp through to the P.531, which had been based on the Skeeter's airframe.

Led by Wandering Spirit, young Cree men attacked officials, clergy and settlers in the small settlement of Frog Lake in the District of Saskatchewan in the Northwest Territories, now located in the province of Alberta, on 2 April 1885. Nine settlers were murdered in the incident.  Causes  Chief Big Bear and his band had settled near Frog Lake about 55 km (34 miles) northwest of Fort Pitt but had not yet selected a reserve site. He had signed Treaty 6 in 1882. Angered by what seemed to be an unfair treaty and by the dwindling buffalo population, Big Bear began organizing the Cree for resistance. Learning of the M√©tis victory at the Battle of Duck Lake a week earlier and of Poundmaker's advance on Battleford, Wandering Spirit, the war chief of Big Bear's band, began a campaign to gather arms, ammunition and food supplies from the surrounding countryside. The nearest source of supplies and the first to be looted were the government stables, the Hudson's Bay Company post and George Dill's store at Frog Lake. Anger among the Cree in the area was directed largely at the representative of the Canadian government, the Indian agent Thomas Quinn, who was the source of the inadequate rations that kept the Cree in a state of near-starvation.  The massacre  A band of Cree led by the war chief Wandering Spirit took Thomas Quinn hostage in his home in the early morning of 2 April. The Cree then took more white settlers hostage and took control of the community. They gathered the Europeans, including two priests, in the local Catholic church, where Mass was in progress. After Mass concluded, at around 11:00 a.m., the Cree ordered the prisoners to move to their encampment a couple of kilometres away. Quinn steadfastly refused to leave the town; in response, Wandering Spirit shot him in the head. In the resulting panic, despite Big Bear's attempt to stop the shootings, Wandering Spirit's band killed another eight unarmed settlers: the two Catholic priests, Leon Fafard and Felix Marchand, Fafard's lay assistant John Williscroft, as well as John Gowanlock, John Delaney, William Gilchrist, George Dill, and Charles Gouin. A Hudson's Bay Company clerk, William Bleasdell Cameron, one of the men rounded up into the church, went to the Hudson's Bay shop to fill an order made by Quinn for Miserable Man after Mass. When the first shots were fired, he escaped with the help of sympathetic Cree, and made his way to a nearby Wood Cree camp, where the chief protected him.W. B. Cameron, \\"Massacre at Frog Lake\\" , University of Alberta Libraries, response by W. B. Cameron to \\"Massacre at Frog Lake\\", Edmonton Journal, 4 Apr 1939, accessed 2 Aug 2009 Theresa Gowanlock and Theresa Delaney, wives of two of the slain men, their families, and approximately seventy others from the town were taken captive. They gathered the white settlers in the settlement into the local church. Thomas Quinn, the town's Indian Agent, was killed after a disagreement broke out. The Cree then shot most of the settlers. Nine people were killed, and three settlers (two widows, Teresa Delaney and Teresa Gowanlock, and a young man, William Cameron) were taken as captives as well as several Metis, such as John Pritchard, who \\"purchased\\" the two widows and put them under his protection. The two Teresa's later wrote a book on their experience - Two Months in the Camp of Big Bear. William Cameron's book Blood Red the Sun was also a popular piece of first- hand history writing. The incident, along with the Metis rebellion at the same time, prompted the Canadian government to send troops and police to the area. The rebellion was eventually put down, and Wandering Spirit, the war chief responsible for the Frog Lake incident, was captured. After the massacre, the bodies of Fafard, Marchand, Delaney and Gowanlock had been hurriedly placed in the cellar under the church by several of the M√©tis residents who were now captive. At great risk, they also moved the bodies of Quinn and Gouin into the cellar of a house near where they were killed. However, they were refused permission to touch the other victims. The church, the rectory and all the buildings of the Frog Lake settlement were burned on April 4, 1885 (the day before Easter). All that remained of the mission was the bell tower and the cemetery. On June 14 the Midland Battalion (the advance guard of Major-General Strange) arrived and buried the victims of the massacre in the cemetery. During their occupation the bell, which was suspended from the fire blackened bell tower, disappeared.  Aftermath  Survivor William Bleasdell Cameron with Horse Child, 12-year-old son of Big Bear. They were photographed together in Regina in 1885 during the trial of Big Bear. Cameron testified in Big Bear's defense.The Cree moved on to Fort Pitt. The massacre prompted the Canadian government to send troops and police to the area. The rebellion was put down. Wandering Spirit, (Kapapamahchakwew) a Plains Cree war chief, Little Bear (Apaschiskoos), Walking the Sky (AKA Round the Sky), Bad Arrow, Miserable Man, Iron Body, Ika (AKA Crooked Leg) and Man Without Blood were put on trial for murders committed during the Frog Lake Massacre and at Battleford (the murders of Farm instructor Payne and Battleford farmer Barney Tremont). None of the accused natives were allowed legal counsel, and Judge Charles Rouleau sentenced each of them to death by hanging. He sentenced three others to hang as well, but their death sentences were commuted. Minister of Justice John Sparrow David Thompson reviewed the cases but mitigating circumstances were not taken into account, and in retrospect, justice seems to have been arbitrarily dispensed. Eight Natives, including Wandering Spirit, were hanged on Nov. 27, 1885, in the largest mass hanging in Canada's history. Although Big Bear had opposed the attack, he was charged with treason because of his efforts to organize resistance among the Cree. He was convicted and sentenced to three years in the Manitoba Penitentiary. Legacy Frog Lake became part of the province of Alberta in 1905. The site of the massacre was designated the \\"Frog Lake National Historic Site\\" in 1923, at the location of the Cree uprising which occurred in the District of Saskatchewan, North-West Territories. Parks Canada says the site designated by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada is extensive, but the national park service owns only a small portion, mainly a graveyard, where a stone cairn and federal plaque were erected in 1924. The geographic coordinates on this page are for that cairn.

Intrinsic viscosity is defined as \\\\left[ \\\\eta \\\\right] = \\\\lim_{\\\\phi \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{\\\\eta - \\\\eta_{0}}{\\\\eta_{0}\\\\phi} where \\\\eta_0 is the viscosity in the absence of the solute, \\\\eta is (dynamic or kinematic) viscosity of the solution and \\\\phi is the volume fraction of the solute in the solution.

Frequency dependence The intrinsic viscosity formula may also be generalized to include a frequency dependence. Applications The intrinsic viscosity is very sensitive to the axial ratio of spheroids, especially of prolate spheroids. For example, the intrinsic viscosity can provide rough estimates of the number of subunits in a protein fiber composed of a helical array of proteins such as tubulin. More generally, intrinsic viscosity can be used to assay quaternary structure. In polymer chemistry intrinsic viscosity is related to molar mass through the Mark‚ÄìHouwink equation. A practical method for the determination of intrinsic viscosity is with a Ubbelohde viscometer.

History The early history of the railway was coloured by concerns about Copper Cliff becoming a suburb of Sudbury. An earlier 1906 plan for a Sudbury, Copper Cliff, and Creighton Electric Railway that would have connected the two centres with the now-abandoned mining town of Creighton had been discarded after heavy opposition from Copper Cliff merchants, who feared the decline of the town's commercial core due to competition with Sudbury, which had over six times as many businesses. The same merchants also opposed the new plan, but were overruled by a vote by Copper Cliff ratepayers. Early on, the railway company was run by No√´l Desmarais, a local Franco-Ontarian businessman and grandfather of the financier Paul Desmarais, who later owned and managed the company. It began operations in 1912 with a single car that was borrowed from the Toronto Suburban Railway. The car was never returned and operated on the SCCSER until the early 1930s when it was sold for scrap. Service was only provided to Copper Cliff initially, with the lines on Notre Dame and Elgin opening shortly afterwards. The railway received electric power through the Wahnapitae Power Company, which was privately owned until it was acquired by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario in 1930. In 1943, the workers at the railway unionized, but by then its time was nearly over as the SCCSER began buying buses in 1947. The line to Bell Park was the first to close in 1948 with the two other lines ceasing service in 1950. The SCCSER rolling stock sat at the carhouse for more than two years, finally being cut up for scrap in 1953. The SCCSER was reorganized in 1951 and renamed Sudbury Bus Lines Limited. Shortly after, it was purchased for a symbolic $1 by the financier Paul Desmarais, who used it as a platform for buying up a number of bus lines throughout Ontario, allowing him to launch his business empire. Bus operations would continue under the new name until 1966, when the company ceased operations and was replaced by Laurentian Transit, which was a consortium of local private bus companies. It in turn was supplanted by Sudbury Transit in 1972, the direct predecessor to the current GOVA municipal transit agency. Routes The SCCSER had three main routes radiating from Elm Street in downtown Sudbury. =Western line= The westerly (and busiest) route ran a short distance from the Elm/Durham intersection to Lorne Street, where it turned south and entered dedicated trackage along the east side of the road. After about 100 metres, the streetcar line and the road angled southwest, running parallel to the Canadian Pacific's Webbwood subdivision. At Gatchell the streetcar line split into two tracks opposite Tuddenham Street to facilitate the passing of cars in rush hour. The line, once again single- track, then continued southwest, passing underneath the INCO railway via a specially-constructed underpass to a junction near Balsam Street in Copper Cliff, where it met the shuttle to the INCO refinery a short distance away. The line then angled northwest and ended at the two-track station near downtown Copper Cliff. It operated right up until the end of rail service in 1950. In addition to this service there was also a short-turn service that ended at Gatchell during peak hours. =Northern line= The northerly route ran from a wye at the Elm/Durham intersection to the SCCSER carhouse at St. Charles Street. This line was entirely single-track and operated for a short distance in the middle of Notre Dame Avenue before entering its own right-of- way on the east side of the road parallel to the CP Stobie Spur. This line operated right up until the end of service in 1950, but had been replaced by buses during peak periods in its last months of operation to clear the line for cars deadheading to and from the carhouse. =Western line= The easterly line ran east in the middle of Elm street for approximately 75 metres before turning south on Lisgar, west on Cedar and south again on Durham. This odd arrangement was rumoured to have existed in order to ensure the carline's passage by a liquor store owned by a controlling interest in the SCCSER, but was more likely done to avoid crossing the CP Stobie Spur twice. Coming to the end of the trackage on Durham, the line entered a private right-of-way on the south side of Elgin Street and angled southeast parallel to the CP mainline through downtown. Passing the CP station at Van Horne, the line turned south across the Nelson Street \\"Iron\\" bridge (which was repurposed into a pedestrian bridge and is still used as such today ) and continued in the middle of Nelson Street to John Street, turning east and running one block to Elizabeth Street, where it turned south once again and ran down the middle of Elizabeth to Bell Park on the shore of Ramsey Lake. This line was also entirely single-track and ceased service in 1948 after the tracks on Lisgar Street were accidentally paved over by a contractor doing road repairs there. The SCCSER today CopperCliffRailwayRemnant Today the SCCSER has all but vanished. None of the streetcar equipment was ever retained for preservation. The streetcar alignments on Lorne and Notre Dame have since been obliterated by road- widening projects and all track was removed from city streets. Traces of the right-of-way near Copper Cliff, including the INCO railway underpass are purported to exist, however they could not be found on any satellite photographs of the area. A fare box used on the railway has survived and is preserved as an artifact at the Flour Mill Museum in the same neighbourhood where the original car barns were located.

The pistol was developed in the late 1950s at the Institute for Artillery Research (Polish: Zak≈Çad Broni Strzeleckiej Centralnego Badawczego Poligonu Artyleryjskiego, which later became the Military Institute of Armament Technology, Polish: Wojskowy Instytut Techniczny Uzbrojenia w Zielonce‚ÄîWITU) by a team consisting of: W. Czepukajtis, R. Zimny, H. Adamczyk, M. Adamczyk, S. Kaczmarski and J. Pyzel. The P-64 is also known as the CZAKWozniak, Ryszard. Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej - tom 3 M-P. Bellona. 2002. pp205-206. (an acronym of the designers' last names with the exception of J. Pyzel, who joined the team after the name had been established). Development The P-64 was drawn from a competition for a new service pistol issued in 1958. At the prototype stage, two versions of the CZAK pistol were created: the Model M (Milicyjny - Police), with a magazine capacity of 6 rounds and chambered to use the .380 ACP (9√ó17mm Short) cartridge and the Model W (Wojskowy - Military), with a longer barrel than the Model M, a 6-round magazine capacity and chambered for the 9√ó18mm Makarov round. During the evaluation phase which took place in 1961, both pistols were compared and the Model M was selected over the Model W. It was then rechambered for the Makarov round and improved with a modified slide catch (the external catch button was removed) and better ergonomics. In 1965, the P-64, manufactured at the ≈Åucznik Arms Factory in Radom, entered service with the army, police and security forces under the official designation 9 mm pistolet wz. 1964 replacing the 7.62mm TT pistol. The P-64 is no longer produced, and is being replaced by the WIST-94 pistol in 9mm NATO caliber. However, the P-64 remains in the inventories of the Polish Armed Forces and the police services. Design details The P-64 is a double-action blowback- operated pistol. It has a spring extractor mounted within the slide. The rotating slide catch, installed inside the pistol's frame, contains a protrusion which acts as an empty case ejector. The pistol's trigger mechanism includes a disconnector (which ensures semi-automatic-only fire); a double- action trigger (which allows the pistol to be both cocked and fired with one pull of the trigger); and an exposed hammer. The slide features a loaded chamber indicator (which, both visually and by feel, indicates the presence of a round in the chamber) and a manual safety lever that prevents the weapon from being accidentally discharged with the hammer either cocked or released. This feature also allows a round to be chambered with the safety engaged or toggled off. In the \\"safe\\" position, the firing pin is locked and the trigger bar is disconnected from the hammer notch. If the hammer is cocked and the safety is engaged, the safety will release the hammer. In 1971 the hammer was modified internally, although some 1971 dated examples exist without the modification, those can be distinguished by the absence of an \\"A\\" marking on the receiver, behind the grip. In 1973 the trigger mechanism was modified and the hammer was changed to a triangular shape, designed to be easier for cocking with the thumb. The P-64 is fed from a 6-round single-stack box magazine. After the last round has been fired, the magazine follower lifts the slide catch, which locks the slide open. The slide can then be released by withdrawing the magazine a short distance and pulling the slide back. The pistol is equipped with a fixed front sight, and a dovetailed rear sight with a square notch. The sights are calibrated for firing at 50 m. The all-steel P-64 is manufactured mainly by machine cutting. It is issued with a spare magazine, a leather holster, and a cleaning kit. Often the magazines sold with the pistol do not match the serial number of the weapon. This pistol has a harsh recoil caused by its relatively small size coupled with the potent 9√ó18mm Makarov round, although Wolff Gunsprings produces a 22 lb recoil spring that will greatly reduce the recoil when compared to the original recoil spring. Despite its similarity to the Walther PP, the P-64 is an original design, holding a Polish patent, number 54822. The patent applies to the unique disconnecter (an elongated plate sliding vertically inside the pistol's frame) which provides an internal safety, decocks the hammer when the safety is engaged, interrupts the weapon's cycle after every shot fired, and allows the weapon to be reloaded with the safety on. Due to its similarities with the Walther PPK, it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a \\"PPK clone\\". It is also commonly referred to as a \\"Polish Makarov\\", although the P-64 is not a Makarov, and its only similarities with the Makarov PM are the blowback action, 9x18 \\"Makarov\\" chambering, and method of takedown. For importation into the USA, target grips are put on the pistol so it will qualify as a \\"Sporting Pistol\\" per ATF regulations, although it is very rare for a P-64 to be sold with the target grips as the original grips are usually replaced by the importers when they arrive at the US warehouse. Many examples imported into the US have very prominent import markings, and any P-64 without import markings or with inconspicuous import markings will earn a premium in the marketplace. The pistol is designed to use steel case ammunition, although brass cased ammunition will function properly as well. After-market grips and grip sleeves are available, and may help reduce perceived recoil. Operators Current * - 1000 pistols presented to Lebanese Army in 2008.≈Åuczak, Wojciech.

Variants With the introduction of more advanced and cost- effective production techniques in the 1970s, a comprehensive redesign of the P-64 was attempted. In 1972, a prototype pistol was developed (called the P-70) with a 14-round magazine capacity and a slide made from copper-welded stamped steel. Instead of steel, the P-70's frame was made from a lightweight alloy. In 1976 another upgraded prototype was introduced, designated the P-75, with an itamide synthetic frame. This pistol was followed by the P-78 in 1978, which features a modular trigger group and a 12-round magazine.

He was state's ninth Governor from 1911 to 1913, and the mayor of Boise from 1903 to 1905. He also acted as prosecutor or defense attorney for a substantial number of criminal cases. Outside of criminal law, he specialized in irrigation and mining cases. Early life Born in Dubuque, Iowa, Hawley's mother died when he was an infant. Two years later, his father followed the gold rush to California, then moved to Texas in 1856.James H. Hawley, History of Idaho : The Gem of the Mountains, The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago (1920). Thus, James grew up with the family of his uncle, James Carr.Edwin H. Peasley, Twelfth Biennial Report of the Board of Trustees of the State Historical Society of Idaho, Boise (1930). James' maternal Carr ancestors included a great-grandfather who was a major during the Revolutionary War, and a grandfather who was a captain in the War of 1812. His father served as a major in a Texas regiment of the Confederate Army.An Illustrated History of the State of Idaho, The Lewis Publishing Company, Chicago (1899). At the start of the Civil War, James tried to join the Union Army as part of an Iowa Volunteer regiment. Rejected as far too young at age fourteen, he gave up the idea when his uncle relocated to California in the early summer of 1861. Then his uncle headed for the newly discovered gold fields in northern Idaho. James was supposed to attend school in San Francisco, but instead he joined his uncle in Idaho, still a part of Washington Territory, during the spring of 1862. Traveling from Lewiston, the two followed the rush into the Florence Basin. Through luck or an acute weather sense, they chose to leave the area for Walla Walla, Washington before the depth of winter set in. According to reports of the time, the 1861-1862 season \\"proved to be one of the coldest in the history of Idaho.\\" M. Alfreda Elsensohn, Eugene F. Hoy (ed.), Pioneer Days in Idaho County, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho (1951). While they waited in Walla Walla, word spread of major new gold discoveries in the Boise Basin, a mountainous area around Idaho City, northeast of present-day Boise. Drawn by the new finds, they moved to the Basin in the spring of 1863. For several months, Hawley worked for wages at the Gold Hill Mine, near Quartzburg. With his savings from that, he bought a placer claim in the area and also searched for gold on other unclaimed land. During the winter of 1863-1864, he sold and distributed issues of the Boise News, the first newspaper published in southern Idaho.Hiram Taylor French, History of Idaho: A Narrative Account of Its Historical Progress, Its People and Its Principal Interests, Lewis Publishing Co., Chicago (1914). Hawley returned to San Francisco to attend City College there in 1865. He also began to read law at an attorney's office. He apparently completed the coursework he wanted by the spring of 1867. However, he then ran into some difficulty in San Francisco, the details of which \\"have not been preserved.\\"John F. McClane, A Sagebrush Lawyer, Pandick Press, Inc., New York (1933). According to one account, he ran away to sea and ended up in China, on the losing side of the Taiping Rebellion. Supposedly, he escaped death after being captured by government forces through the good offices of the British consul. In any case, Hawley returned to the Boise Basin in 1868, and again took up mining and prospecting. Politics and law Still determined to become a lawyer, Hawley continued to read law at a Boise County attorney's office. At the same time, he worked in gold fields all over central Idaho. In 1870, voters in Boise County elected him, as a Democrat, to the territorial legislature.Ben Ysursa, Idaho Blue Book, 2003-2004, The Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho (2003). He reportedly received \\"the largest majority given any one on the ticket.\\" During that term in office, he was appointed chairman of the house judiciary committee. Also, in February 1871, Hawley was admitted to the bar, with the right to argue cases all the way up to the territorial supreme court. In 1874, he was elected to the Territorial Council. Two years later he began a term as chief clerk of the council while also serving as a Commissioner in Boise County. In 1878, he was elected district attorney for the second judicial district of the territory. That district encompassed an area stretching generally from Mountain Home to the Montana border, north of Salmon. Hawley had settled in Quartzburg upon his marriage there in 1875. After he became District Attorney, they moved to Idaho City, the county seat of Boise County. He was elected to another term as District Attorney, and ran unsuccessfully for Territorial Delegate to Congress. Around 1884, he moved to Hailey and practiced law there for two years. In 1885, President Cleveland appointed him United States Attorney for Idaho Territory. Although Hawley retained mining investments in the Boise Basin as well as around Hailey, after about 1886 he began handling more legal business in Boise. He finally moved his family and established a permanent residence there in 1890. Record-keeping in early Idaho Territory was rather hit-or-miss, but it is generally agreed that Hawley served as prosecutor or defense attorney for hundreds of criminal trials during his legal career. Certainly by the time he moved to Boise, his expertise in such matters was in great demand. Hawley played a strong leadership role in Democratic Party politics, including six years as Committee Chair in Boise County. The Illustrated History, published in 1899, said, \\"He has been a member of every Democratic state convention since his arrival in Idaho with the exception of that of 1896.\\" He was elected mayor of Boise in 1902, despite a heavily Republican electorate in the city. Although he received high marks for his administration of city government, he chose not to run again and served a single two-year term. He was elected Governor in 1910, but was defeated during his re-election bid in 1912. Later, he made at least two runs for Idaho's U.S. Senate seat, but never attained that office. Key legal cases Although no specific court cases are mentioned in extant records, Hawley became involved in labor disputes during his terms as district attorney of Boise County. He acted as a mediator in a dispute between striking miners and owners near Hailey. The miners threatened a violent takeover of the properties, but finally agreed to a peaceful resolution. During his term as U.S. Attorney for Idaho Territory, Hawley prosecuted a number of cases against Mormons under the anti-polygamy Edmunds Act. Although he disapproved of the Act on legal grounds, Hawley \\"prosecuted the cases vigorously ‚Ä¶ leaving the punishments to the court.\\" His \\"large circle of close personal friends\\" in the Mormon community respected his adherence to duty. Most apparently did not hold his many successful convictions against him, personally. Hawley again became involved with labor unrest in 1892, two years after statehood. An increase in railroad freight charges squeezed profits in the lead-silver mines in the Coeur d'Alene mining region. The owners responded by introducing more mechanization, reclassified workers to cut their pay, and increased working hours. The resulting strike escalated to violence. After the governor declared martial law, hundreds of miners were swept into a makeshift prison, referred to as the \\"bullpen.\\" Many were then charged with whatever \\"crimes\\" ‚Äì violating injunctions, etc. ‚Äì prosecutors could dream up. Hawley served on the defense team that eventually secured the release of every miner accused during this process. Five years later, Hawley began a long involvement with a case that drew considerable attention in southern Idaho. Cattleman John Sparks, later governor of Nevada, hired him to defend two of his cowboys accused of murdering two sheep herders.David H. Grover, Diamondfield Jack: A Study in Frontier Justice, University of Nevada Press, Reno, Nevada (1968). One cowboy, Jackson Lee \\"Diamondfield Jack\\" Davis, had a notorious reputation as a gunman, and had earlier shot and wounded another sheepman. Despite a deeply flawed case, with much mishandling of evidence by authorities, Davis was convicted and sentenced to hang. With virtually the same physical evidence, such as it was, the other cowboy was declared not guilty. Before the hanging, two other cattlemen confessed to the \\"self-defense\\" shooting of the sheepmen. Because of structural flaws in Idaho's legal system at the time, Hawley never could secure a \\"not guilty\\" verdict for his client. However, he kept after it. Finally, in December 1902, shortly after Hawley was elected mayor of Boise, Davis was pardoned and released from prison. Besides that long effort, in 1899 Hawley acted, along with attorney William Borah as state prosecutor after a re-occurrence of labor violence in the Coeur d'Alene mines of the Silver Valley. (Ironically, Borah was Hawley's most vehement opponent in the Diamondfield Jack case.) During one clash, much mine property was blown up, and strikers shot and killed a non-union miner. Most of the attackers wore masks, so no one specific could be brought to trial for the murder and destruction. Hoping to prevent future violence, the state made an example of Paul Corcoran, a union Secretary. He was convicted as an accessory to various felonies and sentenced to a long prison sentence. When no further union violence ensued, authorities quietly pardoned and released him in 1901. According to fellow attorney and biographer John McClane, Hawley was \\"entirely sympathetic\\" to the drive for workers to unionize ... as long as the unions stayed within the law. His final confrontation came in another case of union violence outside the law. On December 30, 1905, a bomb at his front gate assassinated Idaho's ex-Governor, Frank Steunenberg, who had gained the enmity of the union when he sent troops in to enforce martial law during the 1899 violence. A man using the alias Harry Orchard soon confessed to placing the bomb, saying he had been paid to do so by union officials.J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble: A Murder in a Small Western Town Sets Off a Struggle ‚Ä¶, Simon & Schuster, Inc., New York (1997). With Orchard as their star witness, the State tried to make an example of three unions leaders who had supposedly orchestrated the murder. Hawley again teamed up with Borah to prosecute the State's conspiracy cases. Their first case, in 1907, proceeded against \\"Big Bill\\" Haywood, General Secretary of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM). Haywood's defense team, which included the renowned Clarence Darrow, found enough holes in the State's evidence to secure a \\"not guilty\\" verdict. After the second leader received a \\"not guilty\\" verdict, charges against the third were dropped. Although the State failed, at great expense, to gain a conviction, Hawley always felt the trials had been \\"worth the effort that had been made.\\" In elections soon after Haywood's acquittal, the more radical leaders of the WFM were turned out of office. After that, according to Hawley, the unions \\"have, as a general thing, been under the management of law-abiding men.\\" The assassin, Harry Orchard, plead guilty in March 1908 and was sentenced to hang, but it was commuted to life imprisonment; Orchard died at the state penitentiary in 1954 at age 88. Later life The WFM acquittals did not hurt Hawley's reputation. He still carried on a lucrative law practice and, as noted above, was elected governor. (Nor did Borah suffer.) Hawley retired from politics at age 70, after his second failed bid at a U.S. Senate seat. In 1915, Hawley was appointed to the board of directors for the Idaho State Historical Society. In a subsequent vote by the board, he was elected President of the Society. Five years later, the four-volume History of Idaho was published, with Hawley as its Editor. Hawley remained a strong advocate for the Historical Society throughout his tenure. In his letter of transmittal for the required 1923-1924 biennial report, Hawley pleaded that the Librarian and her Assistant \\"should be given a salary commensurate with the importance of their positions and the character of their duties.\\"James H. Hawley, Ninth Biennial Report of the Board of Trustees of the State Historical Society of Idaho, Boise (1924). He was still president, and still asking for better funding, when he died of a heart attack at age 82 in Boise on August 3, 1929.

Life  Bella was born in Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈° (Liptau-Sankt- Nikolaus), Austrian Empire (now Slovakia), and raised in a Roman Catholic family. He studied at the college in Levoƒça and a seminary in Bansk√° Bystrica before taking a degree at Vienna University. Bella was ordained a priest in 1866. From 1869 to 1881 he was town director of music at Kremnica. He left the priesthood in 1881 and converted to Protestantism, becoming director of music in Hermannstadt/Nagyszeben, now Sibiu in modern Romania, (at that time Kingdom of Hungary) where he remained until 1921. From 1921 to 1928 he lived in retirement in Vienna, moving to Bratislava in 1928, where he died in 1936.  Music  Bella began to compose whilst studying in Levoƒça. At this time his output was largely small-scale, such as church music, folk-song arrangements and some chamber music. In 1873 however, visiting Vienna and Prague, he heard for the first time the music of, amongst others, Robert Schumann, Richard Wagner and Bed≈ôich Smetana. This encounter with romantic music had a profound effect, of which the first result was Bella's 1874 symphonic poem Osud a ide√°l (Fate and the Ideal), which premiered in Prague in 1876. In his day Bella was respected both as a composer and conductor by such important musical figures as Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, Johannes Brahms, Hans von B√ºlow, Joseph Joachim and Ernst von Dohn√°nyi. Bella wrote in many different forms, including songs, church music, organ music, chamber music and orchestral music. His operas include Wieland der Schmied (Wieland the Blacksmith), to a libretto originally written by Richard Wagner and based on German legend. This was written in the period 1880‚Äì1890 and first performed in 1926 in Bratislava, where it was performed in a Slovak version as Kov√°ƒç Wieland. In recent times, Bella's music and reputation have been revived by, amongst others, the Slovak composer and scholar Vladim√≠r God√°r. Recordings of his complete chamber and organ works have been issued by Hudobn√© Centrum in Bratislava. Bansk√° Bystrica's J√°n Levoslav Bella Conservatory, founded in 1992, is named after him.

It is the sixth film in the Air Bud series and the first in the direct-to-video spin-off series Air Buddies, which follows the life of a lonely teenager and his dog who has the uncanny ability to play every sport. The film changes the primary focus of the series from Buddy, an adult golden retriever, to his puppies. It also radically alters the character of the series by making virtually all of the animals speak. Air Buddies was released on December 12, 2006. It is the final film of both Don Knotts and Patrick Cranshaw, released after their deaths. Plot Through a voiceover, Sniffer (voiced by Don Knotts) introduces the five Air Buddies, describes their personalities and recaps how the puppies' father, Air Bud, made the town of Fernfield famous through his love of sports. When their families leave home for a basketball game, the puppies get into trouble with their sitter, Mrs. Niggles, by playing with balls of wool and eating a blueberry pie. This prompts their owners to finally put the puppies up for adoption. Meanwhile, Selkirk Tander (Holmes Osborne) tries to impress Mr. Livingston's (Steve Makaj) son, Bartleby Livingston by showing him a female tiger for his birthday, but Bartleby wanted an animal he can play with. He wants Air Bud (Buddy) because Buddy can play sports. Mr. Livingston offers $500,000 if Selkirk can get Buddy. Selkirk then sends his nephew Grim and assistant Denning to capture Buddy. At school, Noah and Henry collect every boy and girl's profile sheets and photos. After deciding which children who would make good owners, the family decides to call them the next day. Grim and Denning arrive at Buddy's home, only to see Buddy and Molly at the same time, thinking there are two air buds or they are mates. The next morning, the pups decide to run away. Grim and Denning follow them, and manage to catch Budderball by luring him with a doughnut. The other Buddies go and find Budderball; they are also captured and used as bait to catch Buddy and Molly. Buddy manages to free the Buddies but Denning traps him with a net. Molly attempts to save Buddy but gets herself captured. Denning and Grim put Buddy and Molly in the truck, while the buddies chase after them. In wine country, Selkirk is pleased that Denning and Grim captured both Buddy and Molly so he can have them breed puppies and sell them for money. When Grim explains that Buddy and Molly already had puppies, which Denning let get away, Selkirk tells them to lock the dogs in the wine cellar and go and capture them. Selkirk also replaces Grim as the leader of the mission to capture the Buddies. Grim and Denning go back to Buddy's home to capture the Buddies but no luck. The Buddies have sniffed their way to the drive-in, where Grim and Denning are watching 101 Dalmatians. The Buddies find their way to the projection room and walk in front of the projector, their shadows attracting Denning and Grim's attention. Grim and Denning catch up to the Buddies, chasing them to a farm. The Buddies meet Billy the goat and Belinda the pig, who help the Buddies escape from Grim and Denning. The Buddies lure Grim and Denning into a stable and escape through a small hole as Billy locks Grim and Denning in. The Buddies go through the forest then meet the Wolf who leads them to wine country. A skunk's spray enables Sniffer to smell again, so he calls Noah and Henry and they go off to find the Buddies. Buddy and Molly manage to escape to find the Buddies. Budderball falls into a hole, which Buddy and Molly dug, forcing the Buddies to help. Noah and Henry are led by Sniffer through the same farm that the Buddies went through. Noah and Henry are ecstatic and overjoyed at finding Grim and Denning being held prisoners by Billy the goat, and immediately leave to report them and turn them in to authorities over Grim and Denning's protests. Bartleby and his father come to collect the dogs but instead finds the Buddies. Bartleby and his father then put the Buddies in a limousine, when Noah, Henry, Buddy and Molly come to rescue the Buddies. Budderball falls into one of the wine containers and gets drunk. Bartleby catches Budderball but is caught by Sniffer. Noah, Henry, and the dogs release barrels towards Selkirk and Mr. Livingston; the barrels break the wine container. Selkirk and Mr. Livingston fall in, as the container cracks open. Washing out of the container, Sheriff Bob arrives to arrest Selkirk, Denning, and Grim. The Buddies apologize to Buddy and Molly; they understand and say they're ready for their new owners. Budderball decides to stay with Bartleby because he needs a friend. The puppies are introduced to their new families and end up enjoying their new lives. The film ends with Buddy, Molly, Buddha, Budderball, Rosebud, B-Dawg, Mudbud, Sniffer and The Wolf howling to show how they are still family, despite their distance.

Life and career  Weil was born in New York. In the late 1940s she was involved in a relationship with Robert Rauschenberg. The two met while attending the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, and in 1948 both attended Black Mountain College in North Carolina to study under Josef Albers. In 1949 Weil introduced Rauschenberg to a technique for making cyanotypes, also known as blueprints, which she had learned in childhood, and they collaborated on a number of these works over a period of several years. One such piece, Blue Print Photogram For Mural Decoration was included in the 1951 exhibition \\"Abstraction in Photography\\" organized by Edward Steichen for the Museum of Modern Art in New York. On April 9, 1951 a three-page article in Life magazine titled \\"Speaking of Pictures\\" appeared, with photographs by Wallace Kirkland documenting Rauschenberg and Weil making blueprints, many of which no longer exist.\\"Vaporous Fantasies\\". Authors: Cullinan, Nicholas Source: Tate Etc.; September 2011, Issue 23, p7-7, 1p At the Art Students League of New York Susan Weil studied with Vaclav Vytlacil and Morris Kantor.NY Arts Magazine, Erik La Prade Interviews Susan Weil, 2006 Robert Rauschenberg and Susan Weil were married in the summer of 1950 at the Weil family home in Outer Island, Connecticut. Their son, Christopher Rauschenberg was born on July 16, 1951. The two separated in June 1952 and divorced in 1953. In 1957, Weil commissioned Bernard Kirschenbaum to create a geodesic dome as an artist studio in Stony Creek, Connecticut. The two married in 1958 and had a daughter, Sara Kirschenbaum, in 1959. In addition to creating painting and mixed media work, Weil has experimented with bookmaking and has produced artist's books with Vincent Fitzgerald and Company since 1985. During a period of eleven years Weil experimented with etchings and handmade paper while also keeping a daily notebook of drawings inspired by the writings of James Joyce. Her exhibition, Ear's Eye for James Joyce, was presented at Sundaram Tagore gallery in New York in 2003. Since 2000 she has collaborated with photographer Jos√© Betancourt on a series of blueprints. In 2015, Susan Weil's work was included in the exhibition Frontiers Reimagined, a collateral event of the 56th Venice Biennale. Other notable recent exhibitions include Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933-1957, which premiered in 2015 at Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center in Asheville, North Carolina and traveled to the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles and the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University, Columbus. Weil's work is in many major museum collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the J. Paul Getty Museum. Her work has been shown in major solo exhibitions in the United States and Europe, notably at Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center in Asheville, North Carolina, and the Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid, though museums in her home state of New York have yet to organize a comprehensive retrospective of her work. She continues to live and work in New York City.  Awards  Weil has been the recipient of the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship and awards from the National Endowment for the Arts.

Dulong is closely related to the Rawang language of Myanmar (Burma). Although almost all ethnic Derung people speak the language to some degree, most are multilingual, also speaking Burmese, Lisu, and Mandarin Chinese except for a few very elderly people Dulong is also called: Taron, Kiu, Qui, Kiutze, Qiuzi, Kiupa, Kiao, Metu, Melam, Tamalu, Tukiumu, Qiu, Nung, Nu-tz≈≠. Classification Dulong belongs to the Nungish language family of the Central Tibeto-Burman branch of the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. The other two languages in the same family are Anong and Rawang. History Dulong/Rawang is a Tibeto-Burman language cluster spoken on both sides of the China/Myanmar (Burma) border just south and east of Tibet. Within Myanmar, the people who speak the Dulong language (possibly up to 100,000 people) live in northern Kachin State, particularly along the Mae Hka ('Nmai Hka) and Mali Hka (Mali Hka) River valleys. In the past, they had been called 'Hkanung' or 'Nung', and have often been considered to be a subgroup of the Kachin (Jinghpaw). Around 1950, speakers of this language in Myanmar began a movement to use the name /r…ôw…ë≈ã/ (spelled 'Rvwang' in the Rawang orthographies) to represent all of its speakers. The speakers in China, though, continue to use the name 'Dulong'. Geographic distribution There are 14,000 (2,000 census) people speaking in two dialects: 8,500 in Nu River dialect, and 5,500 in Dulong River dialect. The locations of Dulong are Yunnan province (Gongshan Dulong-Nu autonomous county), Xizang Autonomous Region (Gongshan Dulong-Nu autonomous county west to Chayu (Zay√º) county), Gongshan county, Bingzhongluo, and Tibet (Chayu county, Chawalong district). In the past, the Dulong River was known as the Kiu (Qiu) river, and the Dulong people were known as the Kiu (Qiu), Kiutze (Qiuzi), Kiupa, or Kiao. =Dialects= Dulong has two dialects: Dulong River (Central Dulongjiang, Derung River, Northern Dulongjiang, Southern Dulongjiang), and Nu River (Nujiang Dulong). Dialects reportedly inherently intelligible (Thurgood and LaPolla 2003). Other possible dialect names are Melam, Metu, Tamalu, and Tukiumu. Phonology =Consonants= Dulong has twenty-four initial consonants at six points of articulation, plus the consonant clusters /pr, br, mr, kr, xr, gr, pl, bl, ml, kl, gl/ in initial position; only the consonants /p, t,  î, k, n, m, ≈ã, r, l/ occur in final position. =Vowels= Dulong has seven vowels, /i, Œµ, …ô, …ë, …î, …Ø, u/, and three diphthongs, /…ôi, …ëi, …Øi/, which only appear in open syllables. =Tones= Dulong has 3 tones: high level, high falling, and low falling. In the Dulong language, tone has the role of differentiating the meaning of a few words, with about 8% words (out of about 4000) completely relying on tones to distinguish them. Grammar Words can be formed by prefixation, suffixation, or compounding. Word classes include nouns, defined by the ability to appear with a numeral classifier; verbs, defined by the ability to appear with negation and the person and tense marking; postpositions, which are enclitic to NPs, numerals, and classifiers. Adjectives are a subset of stative verbs for which reduplication means intensification or adverbialization rather than the perfective aspect (reduplication with nouns has a distributive meaning, ‚Äòevery‚Äô). Adjectives can be used as predicates or can appear nominalized in a copula clause. Vocabulary Lexical similarity: 74% with Matwang dialect of Rawang.

Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan: The Aurorient Express is a two- part comics series written by Mike Kennedy, and published by Dark Horse Comics between February 2002 and June 2002. The series is set six years before The Phantom Menace, and 38 years before A New Hope. The story features Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. A luxury cloud cruiser has slipped out of control and is going to crash over Yorn Skot. The two Jedi must board the runaway ship and regain control.  Last Stand on Ord Mantell summary  Baroness Omnino has come to the planet Coruscant to negotiate trade routes from her planet Vena. Qui-Gon Jinn and his padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi stop an assassination attempt on her life, made by a palace guard that is mind-controlled. Despite distrusting the Jedi after her husband's death, she summons Obi-Wan to be her personal protection. As they are negotiating this, a distress signal is discovered from Baron Sando's - her son's - freighter, light-years off-course, and she sends them to investigate. At Baron Sando's ship, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan discover everyone on board dead from an attack from a captive Mantellian Savrip, a large reptilian creature. They discover that the ship visited the planet Ord Mantell, so they head there. On Ord Mantell, Qui-Gon uses a mind-trick on the spaceport officer to find out that Baron Sando's ship visited Bold Moisture Plant. On their arrival at the moisture plant, they are attacked by many droids and after they destroy most of them, a man comes out and deactivates the droids. The man introduces himself as Orin Bold and explains that the droids are for protection from Taxer Sundown, who has taken over every other moisture plant and is trying to overtake Orin's plant too. There are rumours that Sundown is a Jedi. Baron Sando's freighter did not land here but at a nearby colony which is in Sundown's territory. Orin's daughter Nella volunteers to take them as she is tired of Sundown's rule. She takes them to her flyer, which to Obi-Wan's surprise is an extremely rare one but she explains that she found it abandoned by local miner. On their way to the colony they fly past a group of Mantellian Savrips, but Qui-Gon stops her from killing them with the flyer guns. Arriving at the colony, they are confronted by a hologram of Taxer Sundown who tells them they shouldn't have come, and they are ambushed by the colonists who are wielding lightsabers for trainees. Nella is kidnapped by a flyer and the attackers suddenly stop - they were being mind-controlled. They get information about Sundown's plans, Obi-Wan is sent after him at Orin Bold's plant and Qui-Gon goes after Nella's kidnappers. Qui-Con follows the kidnapper's flyer trail and discovers it destroyed by Savrips. He suspects Nella is still alive, so he follows the tracks to a Savrip camp. He finds her in a hut but they are discovered by a Savrip. One of the Savrips has learned the common tongue and explains that Sundown is enslaving them and blaming his massacres on them. They decide to all try and meet with Sundown's transport. Back at Orin Bold's plant, it is revealed that Nella's flyer is from Sundown and that they were mind-controlled into believing it was from a miner, and they have been trafficking skimmed credits for him the whole time. Obi-Wan is discovered and in the scuffle, Orin hits Sundown over the head with his crutch and breaks Sundown's mind-control device that he was wearing. Sundown escapes in Nella's flyer and heads to the transport area. At the transport area near the colony Sundown is found to have crashed and died with a broken neck. The transport arrives and Baroness Omnino steps off. She has Chancellor Valorum hostage and explains that everything was fabricated so she could have access to Coruscant. She wants the Savrips for meat, not slaves. Appealing to her ego, Qui-Gon catches her off-guard, chopping off her head revealing another mind-control device. The colonists arrive and start shooting at the Savrips but Qui-Gon defuses the situation, and, pending a Jedi investigation, all is resolved.

It is likely that his name indicates that he was from Selby in Yorkshire. He probably journeyed to Sicily about 1130. In his train was Thomas Brun. In 1137, he was appointed governor of Campania shortly before Salerno, the capital of Campania, was besieged by Count Ranulf of Alife, Duke Henry the Proud, and Prince Robert II of Capua, with the troops of the Emperor Lothair II. Robert stayed in Salerno to defend the city while Roger was in the island capital Palermo. With the cause hopeless, Robert advised the city to surrender and beg imperial protection to prevent a sack by the eager Pisans. The citizens did so and Robert of Selby left to organise the defence of the rest of the province. In 1143, when Pope Innocent II refused to recognise the Treaty of Mignano, Robert of Selby marched on papal Benevento. The Beneventans argued that their royal charter was being violated, whereupon Robert entered the palace and the charter was never seen again. In Summer 1144, Pope Lucius II was barred from Rome by the senatores and the patricius Giordano Pierleoni. He failed in his negotiations with Roger at Ceprano. Robert of Selby led expeditions against the ill- defended Papal States. Lucius' successor, Pope Eugene III, was invited back after the deposition of Giordano, but forced out again in March 1146. Late in 1149, Robert of Selby led him back into the Lateran with a Sicilian troop. Robert of Selby probably acted as a sort of guardian for the young duke of Apulia, Roger, the son of Roger II. According to John of Hexham, writing in 1147, Robert was \\"the most influential of the King's friends, a man of great wealth and loaded with honours.\\" Likewise, in his Policraticus, VII.19, John of Salisbury calls him \\"an able administrator . . . feared by all because of his influence with the Prince, and respected for the elegance of his life . . .\\" A modern opinion is that of John Julius Norwich: \\"Robert's administrative methods were as unorthodox as his way of life. He emerges as a far more cheerful and extrovert character than his master. . .\\" Perhaps Norwich had in mind the incident, recorded in the Policraticus, of Robert negotiating three large bribes from three candidates for the vacant see of Avellaand promptly disclosing the simony to an assembly of bishops, who elected a worthy abbot instead. Robert collected the bribes nevertheless. Sources *Norwich, John Julius. The Kingdom in the Sun 1130-1194. Longman: London, 1970. *Matthew, Donald. The Norman Kingdom of Sicily.

They consist of peanuts and molasses covered in chocolatey coating, and are available in original dark chocolatey flavor and milk chocolatey coatings. The bars are small, similar in size to a \\"fun size\\" or Halloween-size bar. They are especially familiar to residents of the Philadelphia area and neighboring Mid-Atlantic states. Peanut Chews were developed and, during most of their history, manufactured by the Goldenberg Candy Company, which was founded by a Romanian immigrant, David Goldenberg, in 1890. Peanut Chews were first introduced in 1917. The candies were originally developed for use by the U.S. military as a ration bar during World War I. The high-energy, high-protein recipe and unique taste made it popular with the troops.Kanaley, Reid. Philly sweet's global reach. Philadelphia Inquirer, September 18, 2006. In 1921, Harry Goldenberg introduced the first wrapped Peanut Chews candy for retail sales. In the 1930s, the candy was converted from a full-size bar to small individual pieces. In 1949, Harry and Sylvia Goldenberg (second generation) purchased the Peanut Chews Division of D. Goldenberg, Inc., to focus solely on the production of Peanut Chews candies. In 2003, Just Born, Inc., a Bethlehem, Pennsylvania‚Äìbased candy company, purchased the Peanut Chews brand and the Northeast Philadelphia manufacturing facility.Anonymous.

The speaker is C.M.Falsen and next to him sits W.F.K.Christie. The Norwegian Constituent Assembly (in Norwegian Grunnlovsforsamlingen, also known as Riksforsamlingen) is the name given to the 1814 Constitutional Assembly at Eidsvoll in Norway, that voted the Norwegian Constitution and formalised the dissolution of the union with Denmark. In Norway, it is often just referred to as Eidsvollsforsamlingen, which means The Assembly of Eidsvoll.Grunnlov og union 1814 (Det Norske Kongehus)Eidsvoll og Grunnloven 1814 (stortinget.no)Eidsvollsforsamlingen (Store norske leksikon) The Assembly The election started in February 1814 in Christiania (now Oslo) in order for to forge the Norwegian Constitution. The Assembly gathered at the manor house at Eidsvoll (Eidsvollsbygningen) and became known as \\"The Men of Eidsvoll\\" (Eidsvollsmennene). They first met on the 10th April by Eidsvoll Church before the assembly formally opened the next day. It was intended to be composed of delegates from the entire country but the northernmost parts were not represented because of the long distances and lack of time. Riksforsamlingen p√• Eidsvoll 1814 (Store norske leksikon) The presidents and vice presidents of the assembly were chosen for one week at a time. The presidents were: Peder Anker (10‚Äì17 April), Diderik Hegermann (18‚Äì24 April), Jens Schou Fabricius (25 April-1 May), Christian Adolph Diriks (2‚Äì8 May), Christian Magnus Falsen (9‚Äì16 May) and Georg Sverdrup (17‚Äì20 May). Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie was the assembly's permanent secretary. The Assembly agreed upon the text of the Constitution on 17 May 1814 which from the 1820s began to be celebrated as Norway's National Day National Day although the document was actually signed and dated on the 18th. Sverdrup, who was the last president, gave the final speech. The assembly members departed on 20 May with the oath \\"United and loyal until the mountains of Dovre crumble!\\"Grunnlovas historie(Store norske leksikon, author: Ola Mestad) Background Forced in early 1814 to sign the Treaty of Kiel as an ally of France in the later phase of the Napoleonic Wars, the King of Denmark-Norway had to cede Norway to the King of Sweden. The people of Norway, never consulted, objected to the royal sell-out. The vice- roy and heir presumptive of Denmark-Norway, Christian Frederik, took the lead in an insurrection and called a Constitutional Assembly at Eidsvoll. The Norwegian Constitution of 17 May formalised Norway‚Äôs independence after more than 400 years of union with Denmark. On the same day, Christian Frederik was elected King of Norway. As a result of this, Sweden invaded Norway. After a campaign of two weeks, a peace treaty (The Convention of Moss) was concluded. King Christian Frederik was forced to abdicate, but Norway remained nominally independent and kept its Constitution with only such amendments as were required to allow it to enter into a loose personal union with Sweden. On 4 November, the Storting amended the Constitution accordingly, and elected the Swedish king King Charles XIII as king of Norway. Although the two states retained their separate governments and institutions, except for the king and the foreign service, Norwegians grew increasingly discontented with the union, which had been forced upon them. In 1905 the union was peacefully dissolved, giving Norway its full independence. Grunnlovens Jubileet 1814-2014 (Nasjonalbiblioteket) Grunnloven (Store norske leksikon. author: Jon Gisle) Rumor about an African servant in a cabinet In 2014 Aftenposten said that for over 100 years \\"many newspaper articles and history books\\" have retold a rumour about a boy in a cabinet. Supposedly in the spring of 1814 a small African boy kept himself in a corner cabinet and came out and attended to the tobacco pipes of the guests of the manor. The presence of such a servant is not mentioned in letters or diary notes of any of the delegates.

It was situated on a site leased from the Huntington Beach City School District, formerly the site of Gisler Middle School. The school was independently operated and controlled by a board of directors. Due to financial troubles, the school eventually dropped its middle school and relocated to the campus of Grace Lutheran Church. The school was shuttered in 2020 following a large deficit and a 64% drop in enrollment.  Academics  Brethren Christian stated that approximately 95% of their students matriculate directly to college or university immediately following graduation. Students generally scored several years above grade level on standardized testing and nearly 200 points above state and national averages on the College Board SAT Reasoning Test. The school offers a wide variety of academic courses, ranging from the Options Program for students needing academic assistance to Advanced Placement courses. College preparation begins in the junior high program with the introduction to the use of the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, study skills training, and the option for advanced students to take high school level courses. The high school program provides coursework that meets the University of California A-G requirements for university admissions, utilizes test preparation for standardized aptitude tests from The Princeton Review, and offers additional opportunities for individualized planning with the academic dean and additional staff members. Each student taking an Advanced Placement course is required to take the Advanced Placement Examination. The percentage of students passing with a score greater than 3 is significantly higher than the state and national averages for AP courses offered at Brethren Christian. The pass rate for the 2013 testing period was 88% and is among the highest pass rates in Orange County. Approximately 32% of eligible students took at least one AP class during the school year.  Accreditation  BCHS was accredited through both the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and the Association of Christian Schools International. Fine arts Their Band, Drama, and Visual Art departments won awards for excellence in performance. Most recently, Brethren Christian was named a recipient of one of five annual achievement awards in the 12th Annual Orange County Arts Awards program by Arts Orange County, the official Orange County, California arts council. The school received the Spark of Imagination statuette and were named Outstanding Arts Education Program in Orange County. The Brethren Christian Wind Symphony, under the direction of Len Montgomery, went on a tour to New York. Competing against schools from all around the country, BCHS won gold. The high school wind symphony has been named Best Large Band in the Biola University Invitational Christian High School Band Festival for numerous consecutive years, most recently in 2012. The 8 o'clock jazz band won 1st place in the small school division at the Reno Jazz Festival in April 2007, first place in the advanced division of the Fullerton College Jazz Festival in 2010, first place in the intermediate division of the Fullerton College Jazz Festival on April 2, 2011, and first place in the intermediate division of the Irvine Jazz Festival in 2012. The 8 o'clock jazz band was selected from among nearly thirty Orange County, California high schools to be the featured band at the 2011 Music and Arts Commendations for Youth (MACY) Awards program but declined due to other commitments. The band was named Best Student Jazz Band at the 41st Annual MACY Awards. In spring 2012, the band received 3 unanimous superior designations in competitions including the Biola University Invitational Christian High School Band Festival, the Irvine Jazz Festival, and the Southern California School Band and Orchestra Association Regional Festival. Since 2011, the Jazz Combo, a select group of students representing the 8 o'clock Jazz Band, have participated in the annual Huntington Beach, California, Fourth of July parade. For four consecutive years, the band has received the John Philip Sousa Award trophy, given to the group who demonstrates best use of music on a float. Brethren Christian has been recognized as a leader in drama. Winner of the prestigious Music and Arts Commendations for Youth (MACY) Childress Award in 2010, their musical production of Fiddler on the Roof also received 22 individual commendations. The school also participates in \\"The Cappies\\", the Critics and Awards Program for High School Students as well as the ComedySportz High School League. Athletics The Brethren Christian Warriors competed in the Academy League. Other teams include St. Margaret's Episcopal School, Oxford Academy, Whitney High School, Crean Lutheran High School, and Sage Hill School. BCHS has over 40 CIF-SS (California Interscholastic Federation Southern Section) championships. During the 2010 - 2011 school year, notable athletic accomplishments include the 16th consecutive playoff berth in the Southern Section of the California Interscholastic Federation for Girls Basketball and a share of the Academy League Varsity Boys Basketball title. Girls Volleyball defeated several higher ranked schools to compete in the Southern Section California Interscholastic Federation Championship game. It was announced in February 2011 that Brethren Christian had hired a new varsity football coach: former NFL punter and wide receiver, Pat McInally. Coach McInally has expanded the coaching staff to include other high-profile athletes including 15-year National Football League player Jesse Sapolu as Offensive Line Coach.

The network is the largest in Northern Ontario, comprising 41 routes operating between the hours of 5:00am to 10:00pm for regular service and from 10:00pm to 2:00am for night service. Due to the increase in ridership the service has been approved for articulating buses primarily used for the largest routes and during rush-hour times. The annual ridership for the year of 2014 was recorded at 5 million passengers at an estimate of 16,000 daily.City of Greater Sudbury, ridership note The service rebranded as GOVA in August 2019.\\"GOVA is set to go (or va...)\\". Sudbury Star, August 20, 2019. The new name was selected to work bilingually, by pairing the English verb \\"go\\" with its French equivalent \\"va\\". Overview Greater Sudbury Transit features over 90 buses on 41 routes servicing the city centre and outlying neighbourhoods such as Capreol, Chelmsford, Lively and Falconbridge. Greater Sudbury Transit also provides door-to-door services for persons with physical disabilities known as Handi-Transit. The bus fleet consists of 40' low floor buses from Orion with the Orion VI, NovaBus LFS and New Flyer D40LF buses that are in active service. As of August 2010, the Greater Sudbury Transit bus fleet is compromised entirely of low floor \\"wheelchair accessible\\" buses - making Greater Sudbury Transit the first transit authority in all of Ontario to have an \\"Easier Access\\" bus fleet. In 2006, Greater Sudbury Transit introduced five 40' coach-style buses from Nova Bus into its fleet. These buses service the city's longest routes, such as routes 701-Lively, 702-Azilda/Chelmsford, and 703-Val Caron/Hanmer/Capreol, providing increased comfort for those riders travelling long distances. These buses, which are described as having a \\"suburban-style interior\\", luggage racks, LED reading lights above each seat, and comfortable bucket seats with added cushioning. Most routes meet at the Transit Centre in downtown Sudbury (the 103-Coniston and 303-Garson/Falconbridge depart from the New Sudbury Centre Monday to Saturday), and service is provided from 6:15 am to 12:30 am 7 days a week, 363 days a year. Bus service is limited to 6:15 pm on Christmas Eve. There is no bus service on Christmas Day. Private charters can also be arranged. Greater Sudbury Transit also operates a trans-cab service for any outlying area which does not receive bus service (including Long Lake, Richard Lake, Radar Base, Skead, Wahnapitae, Whitefish and Dowling) which provides a taxi from the individual's home to a transit bus stop. As of December 1, 2009, Greater Sudbury Transit buses feature a fully operational audio/visual stop announcement system for passengers who are hearing and/or visually impaired. The stop announcement system also helps non-disabled passengers who are not familiar with a bus route of the transit system if they are not sure where it is they need to get off at to reach their destination. As of April 12, 2012, Greater Sudbury Transit has guaranteed seven bus routes (101, 182, 301, 501, 701, 702, 703) that will always be equipped with bike racks. Cyclists wishing to bring their bikes on other routes are permitted to bring their bike on- board according to the driver's discretion (e.g. not during rush-hour etc.). City staff have indicated that following the construction to the new transit garage there will theoretically be sufficient space within to equip the whole fleet with bike racks. There is not enough space within the current garage to accommodate the additional 0.8 m required per bus with a bike rack. In 2018, it was announced that the City of Greater Sudbury had created a $99 million transit stimulus fund to be spent over a period of 10 years, $72 million of which was contributed by the federal and provincial governments, with the remainder being contributed by the city itself. Some ideas which were considered included a switch to electric buses (which would make Greater Sudbury Transit one of the first transit agencies in Canada to do so), improvements to cycling-transit integration, adoption of \\"smart\\" fare card technology, and a renewal of the existing diesel bus fleet. In February 2019, major changes were announced for the service to be supported by the $99 million fund, which would see the creation of a new bus route, more frequent service (especially on Sundays), more early morning service, fare reductions, and a restructuring of the entire local transit system around three major hubs, rather than the single downtown terminal. These hubs would include the existing terminal as well as one in New Sudbury and another at the south end of the city. History Transit services in Sudbury began with the Sudbury & Copper Cliff Suburban Electric Railway (11 November 1915 - Fall 1951). The SCCSER acquired a secondary system, City Bus Lines (1947‚Äì1950), in 1950. In the fall of 1951, the company reorganized as Sudbury Bus Lines Limited (1951‚Äì1966). This later became an umbrella corporation, Laurentian Transit (Sudbury) Limited (1966‚Äì1972), for the joint operation of transit in Sudbury by Nickel Belt Coach Lines, Local Lines Limited, and DeLongchamp Cartage Company. Until 1972 the system was privately operated, but in that year it was taken over by the City of Sudbury Community Services Department under the name of Sudbury Transit (1972‚Äì2000). Sudbury Transit served an area population of 92,000 with a vehicle fleet of 33 buses and employed 103 workers (1991). The transit system in and around Sudbury today was formed in 2000 during the amalgamation of the cities and towns of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury by combining the existing Sudbury bus service with the surrounding commuter bus lines of Rayside-Balfour, Valley East, and Walden. Thus, Greater Sudbury Transit has an enormous service area for its fleet. Sudbury Transit logo, 1972 The original Sudbury Transit logo was designed by renowned designer Stuart Ash in 1972. The agency later used the municipal logo of Greater Sudbury on its vehicles rather than a distinct transit-specific logo. In 2019, the service rebranded as GOVA. Alongside the rebranding, the routes were reorganized to increase efficiency of travel; instead of the former model where all bus routes travelled to and from downtown, the new model features a number of selected high-frequency bus lines along major arterial routes, paired with collector buses that interchange with the high-frequency routes at one of several transit hubs in the city rather than directly travelling downtown. =Past names= * Sudbury & Copper Cliff Suburban Electric Railway (1915‚Äì1951) * Sudbury Bus Lines, Ltd.

Kostrad is a Corps level command which has up to 35,000 troops. It also supervises operational readiness among all commands and conducts defence and security operations at the strategic level in accordance with policies of the commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces. Kostrad is the main basic warfare combat unit of the Indonesian Army, while Kopassus is the elite-special forces of the Indonesian Army, Kostrad as \\"Komando Utama Operasi\\" still maintains as the first-line combat unit of the Indonesian National Armed Forces along with the Kopassus. This corps has three divisions which are: * 1st Kostrad Infantry Division, headquartered at Cilodong, Depok, West Java * 2nd Kostrad Infantry Division, headquartered at Singosari, Malang, East Java * 3rd Kostrad Infantry Division, headquartered at Bontomarannu, Gowa, South Sulawesi As a corps, Kostrad is commanded by a Panglima (Commander), usually a lieutenant general. Kostrad falls under the army chief of staff for training, personnel, and administration.John Haseman, 'Indonesian strategic command upgraded,' Jane's Intelligence Review, March 1997, p.130 However, it comes under the Commander- in-Chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces for operational command and deployment. Kostrad typically receives best equipment in the Army and its two armoured battalions received Leopard 2A4 and Leopard 2 Revolution tanks. Starting 1984 the Panglima of Kostrad (Pangkostrad) has been charged to lead the conduct of combat operations, called defence and security operations.

General Suharto, was appointed as the first head of Kostrad in 1961, and it was in this role that he was able to assert the army's control in the days following the alleged coup attempt on the evening of 30 September and dawn of 1 October 1965, which ultimately led to Suharto replacing Sukarno as Indonesian president. The command's troops have fought in most Indonesian military operations since their formation, such as the purge of communists and \\"alleged communists\\", including the Operation Trident (), the PGRS (Sarawak People's Guerrilla Force) in Sarawak and the (North Kalimantan People's Force) in Kalimantan. It also involved in Operation Lotus () in the then-Portuguese Timor.

His decision to bring philosophy to young people came from his experience as a professor at Columbia University, where he witnessed underdeveloped reasoning skills in his students. His interest was particularly on developing reasoning skills by teaching logic. The belief that children possess the ability to think abstractly from an early age, led him to the conviction that bringing logic to children's education earlier would help them to improve their reasoning skills. In 1972 he left Columbia for Montclair State College to establish the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC) where he began to take philosophy into K-12 classrooms in Montclair. That year he also published his first book specifically designed to help children practice philosophy, Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery. The IAPC continues to develop and publish curriculum, working internationally to advance and improve philosophy for children. Lipman died, aged 87, in West Orange, New Jersey on December 26, 2010.

The siege was fought at the same time as the Battle of Boulogne, just before Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) through Dunkirk. After the Franco-British counter- attack at the Battle of Arras (21 May), German units were held back to be ready to resist a resumption of the counter-attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General Heinz Guderian, the commander of the XIX , who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of the XIX was not authorised until on the night of By the time that the 10th Panzer Division was ready to attack Calais, the British 30th Infantry Brigade and 3rd Royal Tank Regiment (3rd RTR) had reinforced the French and British troops in the port. On 22 May, the British troops had established roadblocks outside the town and French rearguards skirmished with German armoured units, as they advanced towards Calais. British tanks and infantry had been ordered south to reinforce Boulogne but were too late. They then received orders to escort a food convoy to Dunkirk but found the road blocked by German troops. On 23 May, the British began to retire to the old Calais walls (built in the 1670s) and on 24 May, the siege began. The attacks by the 10th Panzer Division were mostly costly failures and by evening, the Germans reported that about half their tanks had been knocked out and a third of the infantry were casualties. The German attacks were supported by the , while the Allied defenders were supported by their navies delivering supplies, evacuating wounded and bombarding German targets around the port. On the night of the defenders were forced to withdraw from the southern , to a line covering the Old Town and Citadel; attacks next day against this shorter line were repulsed. The Germans tried several times to persuade the garrison to surrender but orders had been received from London to hold out, because an evacuation had been forbidden by the French commander of the northern ports. More German attacks early on 26 May failed and the German commander was given an ultimatum that if Calais was not captured by the attackers would be pulled back and the town levelled by the . The Anglo-French defences began to collapse in the early afternoon and at the order \\"every man for himself\\" was given to the defenders, as Le Tellier, the French commander surrendered. Next day, small naval craft entered the harbour and lifted about while aircraft of the RAF and Fleet Air Arm dropped supplies and attacked German artillery emplacements. In 1949, Churchill wrote that the defence of Calais delayed the German attack on Dunkirk, helping to save the 300,000 soldiers of the BEF, a claim that Guderian contradicted in 1951. In 1966, Lionel Ellis, the British official historian, wrote that three panzer divisions had been diverted by the defence of Boulogne and Calais, giving the Allies time to rush troops to close a gap west of Dunkirk. In 2006, Karl-Heinz Frieser wrote that the halt order issued to the German unit commanders because of the Anglo-French attack at the Battle of Arras (21 May) had a greater effect than the siege. Hitler and the higher German commanders panicked because of their fears of flank attacks, when the real danger was of the Allies retreating to the coast before they could be cut off. Reinforcements sent from Britain to Boulogne and Calais arrived in time to forestall the Germans and hold them off when they advanced again on 22 May. Background =Calais= The term Channel Ports refers to Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk (and sometimes Ostend in Belgium). The ports are the nearest to Cap Gris Nez, the shortest crossing from England and are the most popular for passenger traffic. Calais is built on low ground with low sand dunes on either side and is enclosed by fortifications. There was a citadel in the old town surrounded by water and in 1940 on the east side, the moat was still wet but elsewhere had become a dry ditch. Surrounding the town was an , a defensive fortification, which originally consisted of twelve bastions linked by a curtain wall, with a perimeter of , built by Vauban from 1667 to 1707. In many places, the was overlooked by suburban buildings built in the nineteenth century. Two of the southern bastions and the wall linking them had been demolished to make way for railway lines, leading to railway sidings and quays of the in the harbour. About outside the to the west was Fort Nieulay. Two other forts to the south and east were derelict or had disappeared. Outside the town, low ground to the east and south is cut by ditches, which limit the landward approach to roads raised above ground level. To the west and south-west, there is a ridge of higher ground between Calais and Boulogne, from which Calais is overlooked. =BEF= When plans for the deployment of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) were made, the British Imperial General Staff drew from experience in the First World War. The British Expeditionary Force had used the Channel Ports as their s for supplies, even though they were only from the Western Front. Had the German Spring Offensive of 1918 succeeded in breaking through the front and capturing or even threatening the ports, the BEF would have been in a desperate position. During the Phoney War , the BEF had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as Le Havre and Cherbourg but the Channel Ports came into use, once mine barrages had been laid in the English Channel in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Calais was used for communication and for troop movements, especially for men granted compassionate leave. =The Battle of France= On 10 May 1940, the Germans began an offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, Army Group A ( Gerd von Rundstedt) broke through the French Ninth Army (General Andr√© Corap) in the centre of the French front near Sedan and drove westwards down the Somme river valley, led by comprising under Heinz Guderian and the ( Georg-Hans Reinhardt). On 20 May, the Germans captured Abbeville at the mouth of the Somme River, cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium. The Battle of Arras, a Franco-British counter-attack on 21 May, led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the channel ports, rather than advance southwards over the Somme. Apprehension about another Franco-British counter-attack led to the \\"Arras halt order\\" being issued by the German higher commanders on 21 May. The neighbouring XV (General Hermann Hoth) was held back in reserve and a division of the XLI was moved eastwards, when the corps was only from Dunkirk. Prelude =German offensive preparations= Late on 21 May, (OKH) rescinded the halt order; was to resume the advance and move about north, to capture Boulogne and Calais. The next day, Guderian gave orders for the 2nd Panzer Division ( Rudolf Veiel) to advance to Boulogne on a line from Baincthun to Samer, with the 1st Panzer Division ( Friedrich Kirchner) as a flank guard on the right, advancing to Desvres and Marquise in case of a counter-attack from Calais; the 1st Panzer Division reaching the vicinity of the port during the late afternoon. The 10th Panzer Division ( Ferdinand Schaal) was detached to guard against a possible counter-attack from the south. Parts of the 1st Panzer Division and 2nd Panzer Division were also held back to defend bridgeheads on the south bank of the Somme. =Allied defensive preparations= Calais had been raided by bombers several times, which caused disruption to military movements, confusion and traffic jams, with refugees making for Calais meeting refugees fleeing the port. The French army units in Calais were commanded by (Major) Raymond Le Tellier and the northernmost bastions and fortifications were manned by French naval reservists and volunteers commanded by the (Capitaine de fr√©gate Charles de Lambertye). Various army stragglers, including infantry and a machine-gun company had arrived in the town. On 19 May, Lieutenant-General Douglas Brownrigg, the Adjutant General of the BEF, appointed Colonel Rupert Holland to command the British troops in Calais and to arrange the evacuation of non-combatant personnel and wounded. The British contingent consisted of a platoon of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (A&SH;) who were guarding a radar site, the 2nd Anti-Aircraft Regiment RA, 58th (A&SH;) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment RA and the 1st Searchlight Regiment RA. When the Germans captured Abbeville on 20 May, the War Office in Britain ordered troops to be despatched to the Channel Ports as a precaution. The 20th Guards Brigade was sent to Boulogne. The 3rd Royal Tank Regiment (3rd RTR, Lieutenant-Colonel R. Keller), the 1st Battalion Queen Victoria's Rifles (QVR, Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. M. Ellison-Macartney), the 229th Anti-Tank Battery RA and the new 30th Motor Brigade (Brigadier Claude Nicholson), were ordered to Calais. Most of the units dispatched to Calais were unprepared for action in some respects. The 3rd RTR was part of the 1st Heavy Armoured Brigade (Brigadier John Crocker) and had been about to leave for Cherbourg, to join the British 1st Armoured Division, which was assembling at Pacy-sur-Eure in Normandy. The QVR were a Territorial Army motor-cycle battalion, nominally the divisional cavalry for the 56th (London) Division. They had briefly been attached to the 30th Motor Brigade in April but then were returned to the 56th (London) Division for Home Defence, being deprived of their twenty-two scout cars. The 30th Motor Brigade had been formed on 24 April 1940, from the 1st Support Group, to take part in the Norwegian Campaign. After these orders were cancelled, the brigade was posted to East Anglia to meet a supposed threat of invasion. The main body of the brigade were the 1st Battalion, the Rifle Brigade (1st RB, Lieutenant Colonel Chandos Hoskyns) and the 2nd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps (2nd KRRC, Lieutenant Colonel Euan Miller); these were both highly trained units, each about 750 strong. Late on 21 May, the QVR were ordered to proceed by train to Dover to embark for France. All the motor-cycle combinations and other vehicles were to be left behind. After a confused move it was realised that there had been a staff error and that there was room for the motor-cycle combinations aboard the but they did not arrive before the ship sailed. Lieutenant-Colonel Keller received orders on the night of at Fordingbridge to move the 3rd RTR to Southampton but during the journey the personnel train was diverted to Dover, while the vehicles continued to Southampton as planned. Keller was briefed at Dover to go to Calais and given sealed orders for the British port commander. The ships carrying the personnel of the 3rd RTR and the QVR departed Dover at They arrived at Calais around under a pall of smoke from buildings on fire in the town. The QVR landed without their motorcycles, transport or 3-inch mortars and only smoke bombs for the 2-inch mortars. Many of the men were armed only with revolvers and had to scavenge for rifles from those dumped on the quay by personnel hastily departing for England. The 229th Anti-Tank Battery RA also arrived but in the haste to move, four of the twelve anti-tank guns had to be left behind. While they waited for their vehicles to arrive, the men of the 3rd RTR were ordered to disperse in the sand dunes and were bombed soon after. Keller met Holland who told him to take orders from the BEF GHQ but at Brownrigg arrived in Calais and ordered Keller to move the 3rd RTR south-west as soon as it had unloaded, to join the 20th Guards Brigade at Boulogne. After Brownrigg left, Major Ken Bailey turned up from GHQ with orders for the 3rd RTR to go to St. Omer and Hazebrouck, east of Boulogne, to make contact with GHQ. Brownrigg had gone to Dover, unaware that his orders at Calais had been superseded. He met Nicholson and briefed him to relieve Boulogne with the 30th Infantry Brigade and the 3rd RTR. The ship with the 3rd RTR tanks arrived from Southampton at but unloading was very slow, as of petrol had been loaded on deck and had to be moved using only the ship's derricks, as a power cut had immobilised the cranes on the docks. A power cut and a strike by the ship's crew for hours during the night of added to the delay and the captain had intended to leave the harbour without waiting, until he was held up at gunpoint by a 3rd RTR officer. The dock workers were exhausted, having been at work unloading rations for the BEF for many hours and it was not until the following morning that the vehicles had been unloaded and refuelled. The cruiser tanks had been loaded first and had to be unloaded after everything else. More delay was caused by the tank guns having been coated in a preservative and loaded separately. The guns had to be cleaned off,before they could be remounted. Battle =22 May= The 3rd RTR had been assembling its and at Coquelles on the Calais‚ÄìBoulogne road according to the orders received from Brownrigg and a patrol of light tanks was sent down the St. Omer road according to the orders received from GHQ via Bailey. The patrol found the town empty, under bombardment and illuminated by the fires of burning buildings, at which the patrol returned to Coquelles at about in the morning of 23 May. (The patrol was fortunate to miss the 6th Panzer Division, which had laagered around Gu√Ænes, west of the St. Omer road for the night.) Calais was within the range of RAF aircraft based in Britain and at , Hawker Hurricanes of 151 Squadron shot down a Junkers Ju 88 bomber between Calais and Boulogne and Spitfires of 74 Squadron shot down another , both from (LG 1). Fighters from 54 Squadron and 92 Squadron claimed five Messerschmitt Bf 109s of (JG 27, Fighter Wing 27) for one Spitfire during the morning and in the afternoon, 92 Squadron lost two Spitfires shot down to Messerschmitt Bf 110s of (ZG 26) and (ZG 76). From LG 1 lost five aircraft over the Channel ports before II./ was assigned to the group as escorts while JG 27 lost 10 Bf 109s. Six British fighters were lost. (StG 77, Dive Bomber Wing 77) lost five on this date. No. 2 Group RAF flew support sorties in the area from 21 to 25 May, losing 13 bombers. The German advance resumed in the morning and at the panzers crossed the Authie. During the afternoon, French rearguards, with some parties of British and Belgian troops, were met at Desvres, Samer and the vicinity of Boulogne. The Allied air forces were active and made bombing and strafing attacks on the German forces, with little opposition from the . The 10th Panzer Division was released from its defensive role and Guderian ordered the 1st Panzer Division, which was near Calais, to turn east towards Dunkirk and the 10th Panzer Division to move from Doullens to Samer and thence to Calais. The 1st Panzer Division was to advance eastwards to Gravelines at the next day. The 10th Panzer Division advance was delayed around Amiens, because infantry units which were to relieve the division in the bridgehead on the south bank of the Somme, arrived late and the British reinforcements sent to Calais forestalled the Germans. =23 May= On 23 May, the threat to the German flanks at Cambrai and Arras had been contained and ( Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen) became available to support the 10th Panzer Division at Calais. Most of the Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers were based around Saint Quentin, after leap-frogging forward in the wake of the advance but Calais was at the limit of their range. As units moved forward they had also come within the range of Fighter Command aircraft in England and Richthofen assigned I JG 27 (I Wing, Fighter Group 27) to Saint-Omer for fighter cover. Among the (groups) flying in support of the 10th Panzer Division were StG 77, StG 1 ( [Lieutenant-Colonel] Eberhard Baier), StG 2 ( [Group Commander] Oskar Dinort) and the medium bombers of (KG 77, [Colonel] Dr. Johan-Volkmar Fisser). The units engaged RAF fighters and 92 Squadron shot down four Bf 109s; three I JG 27 pilots were taken prisoner, one was killed in action and 92 Squadron lost three Spitfires with their pilots. To reinforce the German fighters, I Jagdgeschwader 1, which was also based nearby to the south, was called on to escort Ju 87 units attacking Calais. Flying from forward airfields at Monchy- Breton, (Captain) Wilhelm Balthasar led JG 1 against the British Spitfires and claimed two of the four from his unit but lost one pilot killed. The 3rd RTR received the report of the reconnaissance patrol and Bailey went back to GHQ with a light tank escort. Bailey became separated from the escort, ran into the advanced guard of the 1st Panzer Division at a crossroads on the St. Omer road and the driver was killed. The Germans were driven off by the men of a Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) petrol convoy, which had arrived on the scene. Bailey and the wounded passenger returned to Calais at about noon and told Keller that another attempt should be made, since the Germans had retired. Keller had already received information from the French that German tanks were moving towards Calais from Marquise. Despite doubts, Keller sent the rest of the 3rd RTR to follow the light tanks from Coquelles towards St. Omer at When about south-east of Hames-Bources, the rearguard tanks and anti-tank guns of the 1st Panzer Division were spotted on the Pihen-les-Gu√Ænes road (guarding the rear of the division as the main body moved north-east towards Gravelines). The 3rd RTR drove back German light tanks on the St. Omer road, but despite losses, the heavier German tanks and anti-tank gun screen knocked out from tanks, before Nicholson ordered the 3rd RTR back to Calais. Other units of the 1st Panzer Division moving on Gravelines met about fifty men of C Troop, 1st Searchlight Regiment at Les Attaques, about south-east of Bastion 6 in the Calais enceinte. C Troop had built a roadblock with a bus and a lorry, covered by Bren guns, rifles, and Boys anti-tank rifles and held out for about three hours before being overrun. German tank and infantry parties then attacked a post at Le Colombier further along the St.Omer‚ÄìCalais road but were caught in crossfire from other posts and the guns of the 58th Light Anti- Aircraft Regiment on high ground near Boulogne. The Germans were repulsed until the post was withdrawn at Calais was not the objective of the 1st Panzer Division but Kruger, commanding the battlegroup which was engaged at Gu√Ænes, Les Attaques and Le Colombier, had orders to take Calais from the south-east, if this could be achieved by a . As night fell the division reported that Calais was strongly held and broke off its attacks to resume the advance on Gravelines and Dunkirk. Earlier, at Schaal had ordered the main body of his 10th Panzer Division, consisting of the 90th Panzer Regiment (two tank battalions) and 86th Rifle Regiment (two infantry battalions) supported by a battalion of medium artillery, to advance up the main road from Marquise to the high ground around Coquelles, which would give them good observation over Calais. Meanwhile, on the right flank, a battlegroup based on the division's 69th Rifle Regiment (two infantry battalions) was to advance from Gu√Ænes to the centre of Calais. When Nicholson had arrived in Calais in the afternoon with the 30th Infantry Brigade, he had discovered that the 3rd RTR had already been in action and had considerable losses, and that the Germans were closing on the port and had cut the routes to the south-east and south-west. Nicholson ordered the 1st RB to hold the outer ramparts on the east side of Calais and the 2nd KRRC to garrison the west side, behind the outposts of the QVR and the anti-aircraft units outside the town, which began a retirement to the from about and continued during the night. Just after Nicholson received an order from the War Office to escort a truck convoy carrying to Dunkirk to the north- east, which was to supersede any other orders. Nicholson moved some troops from the defence perimeter to guard the Dunkirk road, while the convoy assembled but the 10th Panzer Division arrived from the south and began to bombard Calais from the high ground. At the 3rd RTR sent a patrol of a Cruiser Mk III (A13) and three light tanks to reconnoitre the convoy route, which ran into the 1st Panzer Division roadblocks covering the road to Gravelines. The tanks drove through the first barricade, then found many Germans beyond the third road block, who mistook the tanks for German, even when one of the tank commanders asked if they \\"\\" The British tanks drove on for about , were inspected by torchlight and then stopped at a bridge over the Marck, to clear a string of mines which had been laid across the road. Two mines were blown up by 2-pounder fire and the rest dragged clear, the tanks then becoming fouled by coils of anti-tank wire, which took twenty minutes to cut free. The tanks then drove on and reached the British garrison at Gravelines but the radio in the A13 failed to transmit properly and Keller received only garbled fragments of messages, suggesting that the road was clear. A force of five tanks and a composite company of the Rifle Brigade led the truck convoy at Near Marck, about east of Calais, they encountered a German road block which they outflanked but at daylight it was clear they would soon be surrounded and they withdrew to Calais. =24 May= At the French coastal guns opened fire and German artillery and mortar fire began falling on the port at dawn, particularly on French gun positions, preparatory to an attack by the 10th Panzer Division against the west and south-west parts of the perimeter. The retirement of the QVR, searchlight and anti-aircraft troops from the outlying roadblocks had continued overnight until about when the troops completed their withdrawal to the enceinte. Further west, B Company of the QVR was ordered back from Sangatte, about west of Calais at and had retired slowly to the western face of the by and a C Company platoon out on a road east of Calais, also stayed out until but before midday, the main defensive line had been established on the . The first German attacks were repulsed except in the south, where the attackers penetrated the defences until forced back by a hasty counter-attack by the 2nd KRRC and tanks of the 3rd RTR. The German bombardment was extended to the harbour, where there was a hospital train full of wounded waiting to be evacuated. The harbour control staff ordered the wounded to be put aboard the ships, which were still being unloaded of equipment for the infantry battalions and rear echelon of the tank regiment. The dock workers and rear-area troops were also embarked and the ships returned to England, with some of the equipment still on board. During the afternoon the Germans attacked again on all three sides of the perimeter, with infantry supported by tanks. The French garrison of Fort Nieulay, outside the western ramparts surrendered after a bombardment. French marines in Fort Lapin and the coastal artillery emplacements spiked the guns and retreated. On the southern perimeter the Germans broke in again and could not be forced back, the defence being hampered by fifth columnists sniping from the town. The German troops who broke in began to fire in enfilade on the defenders from the houses they had captured. The defenders on the ramparts ran short of ammunition and the 229th Battery was reduced to two operational anti-tank guns. The Germans had great difficulty in identifying British defensive positions and by had managed only a short advance. At the 10th Panzer Division reported that a third of the equipment, vehicles and men were casualties, along with half of the tanks. The Royal Navy had continued to deliver stores and take off wounded. The destroyers , , , , and the Polish Okrƒôt Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej (ORP) Burza bombarded shore targets. The Ju 87 Stuka units made a maximum effort during the day, Wessex was sunk and Burza was damaged by StG 2 and StG 77 during a raid at StG 2 were ordered to target shipping. Dinort attacked Wessex but the destroyer made an elusive target and he missed after bombing on the second dive; the other two groups made a forty- strong formation which hit Wessex several times. The German crews had little training on anti-shipping operations but in the absence of British fighters, dived from ; as the departed they were attacked by Spitfires of 54 Squadron which shot down three of the dive-bombers and lost three Spitfires to the Bf 109 escorts. Wolfhound put into Calais and the captain reported to the Admiralty that the Germans were in the southern part of town and that the situation was desperate. Nicholson had received a message from the War Office at that Calais was to be evacuated and that once unloading was complete, non- combatants were to be embarked; at Nicholson was told that the fighting troops would have to wait until 25 May. Lacking a reserve to counter-attack at the perimeter, Nicholson ordered a retirement to the Marck canal and Avenue L√©on Gambetta and during the night, the defenders retreated to the Old Town and the area to the east, inside the outer ramparts and the Marck and Calais canals, while holding the north‚Äìsouth parts of the , on both sides of the port. Le Tellier had set up the French headquarters in the Citadel on the west side of the Old Town but command of the French forces remained divided, with Lambertye still in charge of the naval artillery. It had been arranged that French engineers would prepare the bridges over the canals for demolition but this had not occurred and the British had no explosives to do it themselves. Nicholson was informed by a signal at from General Edmund Ironside the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) that General Robert Fagalde, the French commander of the Channel Ports since 23 May, had forbidden an evacuation and that the Calais defenders must comply. As the harbour had lost its significance, Nicholson was to choose the best position from which to fight on; ammunition would be sent but no reinforcements. Nicholson was told that the 48th Division (Major-General Andrew Thorne) had begun to advance towards Calais to relieve the defenders. From the French naval gunners spiked most of their guns and made their way to the docks to embark on French ships. Lambertye refused to go, despite being ill, and asked for volunteers from the and army personnel to stay behind, about fifty men responding despite being warned that there would be no more rescue attempts. The volunteers took over Bastion 11 on the west side and held it for the duration of the siege. =25 May= During the night, Vice-Admiral James Somerville crossed from England and met Nicholson, who said that with more guns he could hold on for a while longer and they agreed that the ships in the port should return. At dawn on 25 May, the German bombardment resumed, concentrating on the old town, where buildings fell into streets, high winds fanned fires everywhere and smoke from explosions and the fires blocked the view. The last guns of the 229th Anti- Tank Battery were knocked out and only three tanks of the 3rd RTR remained operational. Distribution of rations and ammunition was difficult and after the water mains were broken, derelict wells were the only source. At Schaal sent the mayor, Andr√© Gerschell, to ask Nicholson to surrender who refused. At noon, Schaal offered another opportunity to surrender and extended the deadline to when he found that his emissaries had been delayed, only to be refused again. The German bombardment increased during the day, despite attempts by Allied ships to bombard German gun emplacements. In the east, the 1st Rifle Brigade and parties of the QVR on the outer ramparts and the Marck and Calais canals repulsed a determined attack. The French then eavesdropped on a German wireless message, which disclosed that the Germans were going to attack the perimeter on the west side, held by the 2nd KRRC. At Nicholson ordered a counter-attack and eleven Bren carriers and two tanks with the 1st RB were withdrawn and assembled for a sortie. The attackers were to depart from the north of the and rush round to the south to get behind the Germans. Hoskyns, the 1st RB commander objected, since the plan required the withdrawal of tanks and men from where the Germans were close to breaking through. Hoskyns was over-ruled and it took too long to contact Nicholson, because telephone and radio communication had been lost. The attack went ahead but the carriers bogged in the sand and the attempt failed. At about the units holding the Canal de Marck were overwhelmed and Hoskyns was mortally wounded by a mortar bomb. Major A. W. Allan, the second-in-command of 1st RB, took over the battalion which then made a fighting withdrawal northwards through the streets, to the , the and the quays. In the south-east corner, at the 1st RB positions near the , a rearguard was surrounded and a counter-attack to extricate them was repulsed. Some of the rearguard broke out in a van driven by a fifth columnist at gunpoint but he stopped before reaching safety and few of the wounded reached cover. Only of the the area escaped. The units of the RB and QVR withdrawing from the northern part of the gained a respite when German artillery mistakenly shelled their own troops (II Battalion, Rifle Regiment 69) who were forming up in a small wood to the east of Bastion No. 2. In the afternoon, a German officer with a captured French officer and Belgian soldier, approached under a flag of truce to demand a surrender, which Nicholson refused. The German attack was resumed and continued until the German commander decided that the defenders could not be defeated before dark. In the old town the KRRC and more parties of the QVR fought to defend the three bridges into the Old Town from the south but at the German artillery ceased fire and tanks attacked the bridges. Three panzers attacked and two were knocked out, the third tank retiring. At , the middle bridge, the first tank drove over a mine and the attack failed. At , near the Citadel, the attempt succeeded and the bridge was captured by tanks and infantry, who took cover in houses north of the bridge, until counter-attacked by the 2nd KRRC. Parties of French and British troops held a bastion, the French in the Citadel lost many men repulsing the attacks and Nicholson established a joint headquarters with the French. Shortly after Hoskyns (commanding the 1st RB) was mortally wounded, Lieutenant Colonel Keller, commanding the 3rd RTR, decided that his few remaining tanks under shellfire near the Bastion de l'Estran, could no longer play a useful part in the defence. He ordered them to withdraw eastwards through the sand dunes north of the while he himself tried to evacuate men from Bastion No. 1 to the sand dunes; the wounded were captured a short time later. Riding on a light tank, Keller later reached C Company of the 1st RB north-east of the , where he suggested that they and his tanks withdraw to Dunkirk but his last tanks broke down or ran out of fuel and were destroyed by their crews. At nightfall Keller and some of the crews made their way on foot to Gavelines. Keller and one of his squadron commanders were able to cross the Aa River; next morning they contacted French troops and were later evacuated to Dover. At GMT, 17 Squadron claimed three destroyed over Calais and three damaged, plus a Do 17. Air cover was maintained by 605 Squadron, which claimed four Ju 87s and a Hs 126 destroyed with another five unconfirmed claims, after an engagement at while escorting Bristol Blenheim on a reconnaissance sortie. The formation of 40 to 50 attacked shipping near the port. 264 Squadron flew escort operations in the afternoon without incident. On 25 May, 11 Group flew bomber and sorties, losing two Blenheims and two fighters, against shot down and nine damaged to all causes. RAF Bomber Command flew against land targets on 25 May. StG 2 lost four Ju 87s and one damaged. All eight of the crews shot down were captured but released after the French surrender. =26 May= In case Fagalde relented, fifteen small naval vessels towing boats, with room for about waited offshore, some sailed into Calais harbour without an evacuation order and one vessel delivered another order for Nicholson to continue the battle. At Nicholson reported to England that the men were exhausted, the last tanks had been knocked out, water was short and reinforcement probably futile, the Germans had got into the north end of town. The resistance of the Calais garrison had led the German staff to meet late on 25 May, when Colonel Walther Nehring, the XIX Chief of Staff, suggested to Schaal that the final attack should be postponed until 27 May, when more would be available. Schaal preferred to attack, rather than give the British time to send reinforcements. At , the German artillery resumed its bombardment. Several artillery units had been brought up from Boulogne, doubling the numbers of guns available to Schaal. From the old town and citadel were attacked by artillery and up to 100 , after which the infantry attacked, while the German guns and StG 77 and StG 2 subjected the Citadel to heavy assaults for another thirty minutes. The 2nd KRRC continued to resist the German infantry attacks at the canal bridges. Schaal was told that if the port had not been surrendered by the division would be ordered back until the had levelled the town. The Germans began to break through around when Bastion 11 was captured after the French volunteers ran out of ammunition. On the other side of the harbour, the 1st RB held positions around the , under attack from the south and east. Major Allan, in command, held on in the belief that the 2nd KRRC might withdraw north-east to the to make a joint final defence of the harbour. At the Germans finally overran the and the . The survivors of the 1st RB made a last stand on and around Bastion No. 1, before being overwhelmed at The 2nd KRRC retreated from the three bridges between the old and new towns, to a line from the harbour to the cathedral between and , from one of the bridges. Troops in the Citadel began to show white flags. German tanks crossed and British troops dispersed, having no weapons to engage tanks. At the new line collapsed and the 2nd KRRC was given the order \\"every man for himself\\", after which only B Company fought as a unit, not having received orders to retreat to the harbour. The occupants of the Citadel realised that the German artillery had ceased fire and found themselves surrounded around a French officer arrived, with news that Le Tellier had surrendered. During the day, the RAF flew near Calais, with six fighter losses from 17 Squadron, which attacked dive-bombers of StG 2, claimed three, a Dornier Do 17 and a Henschel Hs 126. Fleet Air Arm (FAA) Fairey Swordfish aircraft, bombed German troops near Calais and the escorts from 54 Squadron claimed three and a for the loss of three aircraft. At noon 605 Squadron claimed four from StG 77 and a for a loss of a Hurricane. JG 2 protected the Ju 87s, fought off the attacks from 17 Squadron and there appear to have been no German losses, while they shot down Blenheim on a reconnaissance sortie. were able to conduct fighter sweeps over Calais after noon, with the battle almost over. Seven Bf 109s engaged a flight of Hurricanes, the dogfight extending over Calais; one Hurricane was shot down for no loss to JG 3. Aftermath =Analysis= In 2006, Sebag-Montefiore wrote that the defence of the advanced posts outside Calais, by inexperienced British troops against larger numbers of German troops, may have deterred the 1st Panzer Division commanders from probing the Calais defences further and capturing the port. In the early afternoon of 23 May, it was unlikely that the British troops on the Calais were prepared to receive an attack, the 2nd KRRC and 1st RB having disembarked only an hour earlier at The unloading of the 2nd KRRC vehicles was delayed until and half of the battalion did not arrive at its positions until An attack on Calais in the early afternoon would only have met the QVR. The day after Calais surrendered, the first British personnel were evacuated from Dunkirk. In (1950, English edition 1952), Guderian replied to a passage in Their Finest Hour (1949) by Winston Churchill, that Hitler had ordered the panzers to stop outside Dunkirk in the hope that the British would make peace overtures. Guderian denied this and wrote that the defence of Calais was heroic but made no difference to the course of events at Dunkirk. In 1966, Lionel Ellis, the British official historian, wrote that the defence of Calais and Boulogne diverted three panzer divisions from the French First Army and the BEF; by the time that the Germans had captured the ports and reorganised, III Corps (Lieutenant-General Ronald Adam) had moved west and blocked the routes to Dunkirk. In 2005, Karl-Heinz Frieser wrote that the Franco-British counter-attack at Arras on 21 May, had a disproportionate effect on the Germans, because the German higher commanders were apprehensive about flank security. Ewald von Kleist, the commander of perceived a \\"serious threat\\" and informed Colonel-General Franz Halder (Chief of the General Staff of OKH), that he had to wait until the crisis was resolved before continuing. Colonel-General G√ºnther von Kluge, the 4th Army commander, ordered the tanks to halt, an order supported by Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group A. On 22 May, when the Anglo-French attack had been repulsed, Rundstedt ordered that the situation at Arras must be restored before moved on Boulogne and Calais. At (OKW, High Command of the Armed Forces) the panic was worse and Hitler contacted Army Group A on 22 May, to order all mobile units to operate either side of Arras and further west; infantry units were to operate to the east of the town. The crisis among the higher staffs of the German army was not apparent at the front and Halder formed the same conclusion as Guderian, the real threat was that the Allies would retreat to the channel coast and a race for the channel ports began. Guderian had ordered the 2nd Panzer Division to capture Boulogne, the 1st Panzer Division to take Calais and the 10th Panzer Division to seize Dunkirk, before the halt order. Most of the BEF and the French First Army were still from the coast but despite delays, British troops were sent from England to Boulogne and Calais just in time to forestall the XIX Corps panzer divisions on 22 May. Had the panzers advanced at the same speed on 21 May as they had on 20 May, before the halt order stopped their advance for Boulogne and Calais would have fallen easily. (Without a halt at Montcornet on 15 May and the second halt on 21 May, after the Battle of Arras, the final halt order of 24 May would have been irrelevant, because Dunkirk would have already fallen to the 10th Panzer Division.) =Casualties= In 1952, Guderian wrote that the British surrendered at and that 20,000 prisoners were taken, including British troops, the remainder being French, Belgian and Dutch, most of whom had been \\"locked in cellars by the British\\" after they had ceased to fight. In 2006, Sebag-Montefiore wrote that German casualties killed and wounded during the battle were not recorded but probably amounted to several hundred. Brigadier Nicholson was never able to give his views as he died in captivity on 26 June 1943 aged 44. Lieutenant-Colonel Chandos Hoskyns, commanding the Rifle Brigade, was mortally wounded on 25 June and died in England. Capitaine de fr√©gate Charles de Lambertye, commanding the French contingent, died of a heart attack while touring the defences of Calais on 26 May. German situation reports recorded lost or damaged from the RAF lost =Subsequent operations= When the evacuation of troops was stopped, the Vice-Admiral Dover, Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay sent smaller craft to remove surplus men and the launch Samois, made four journeys to take wounded back to England. The yacht Conidaw entered the harbour on 26 May and ran aground. The yacht was refloated on the afternoon tide and brought away as other vessels took other casualties. During the night of Ramsay had the motor yacht Gulzar painted with red crosses and sailed to Calais to recover wounded. At Gulzar entered the harbour and docked at the Gare Maritime pier; a party went ashore and were fired on. The party ran back and the boat cast off, as Gulzar was fired on from around the harbour. British troops on the eastern jetty called out and shone torches, which were seen by the crew and the Gulzar turned back, the fugitives jumped aboard, the yacht still under fire and escaped. On 27 May, the RAF responded to a War Office request the evening before, to drop supplies to the Calais garrison, by sending twelve Westland Lysander aircraft to drop water at dawn. At dropped ammunition on the Citadel, as nine Swordfish of the FAA bombed German artillery emplacements. Three Lysanders were shot down and a Hawker Hector was damaged. Commemoration Calais 1940 was awarded as a battle honour to the British units in action. Orders of battle Data from Routledge (1994) Farndale (1996) and Ellis (2004) unless indicated.

The heavy-set crew cut-wearing Grabowski appeared in minor roles in many films produced by Albert Zugsmith and Walt Disney. He was Polish- American.http://www.hotrodhotline.com/feature/guestcolumnists/Ronald%20Kregoski/kookiepart3/ In 1952, after leaving military service, Grabowski built a hot rod based on a shortened 1922 Ford Model T touring car mated to a similarly extremely shortened Model A pickup truck bed. With a powerful Cadillac overhead valve engine that came from his parents' sedan, the vehicle that resulted had a unique appearance and stance, which inspired many hot rods created afterward. The car was first featured on the cover of the October, 1955 issue of Hot Rod and then underwent further modifications, including a greater rake, tilted windshield and blue paint with flames when it famously appeared in color on the cover of the April, 1957 issue of Car Craft magazine, as well as in the April 29, 1957 issue of LIFE.p.165 Vincent, Peter Hot Rod: The Photography of Peter Vincent 2004 Motorbooks Grabowski's hugely influential T-bucket hot rod, which became known as the Kookie Kar, was used in the television show 77 Sunset Strip.

The contacts he made in this way led to an acting career for Grabowski. He appeared in television shows, including The Monkees, Batman (episodes 39 and 40 in 1966), The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, and The New Phil Silvers Show, and films such as High School Confidential (1958), The Beat Generation (1959), The Big Operator (1959), Girls Town (1959), College Confidential (1960), Sex Kittens Go to College (1960), The Misadventures of Merlin Jones (1964), Roustabout (1964), Girl Happy (1965), The Monkey's Uncle (1965), Out of Sight (1966), Blackbeard's Ghost (1968), The Towering Inferno (1974), Hooper (1978) and The Cannonball Run (1981). Grabowski was known as a wood carver, and many hot rods and custom cars feature his unique hand-carved skull gearshift knobs. He retired from acting in the 1980s after The Cannonball Run. Grabowski died on October 12, 2012, at the age of 79.

Potluck dinners are often organized by religious or community groups, since they simplify the meal planning and distribute the costs among the participants. Smaller, more informal get- togethers with distributed food preparation may also be called potlucks. The only traditional rule is that each dish be large enough to be shared among a good portion (but not necessarily all) of the anticipated guests. In some cases each participant agrees ahead of time to bring a single course, and the result is a multi-course meal. This agreement rectifies the problem of many participants bringing the same dish.

Written by Diane Ruggiero and directed by Steve Gomer, the episode premiered on UPN on May 2, 2006. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin) is put on trial for the murder of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), and Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) have to testify. Meanwhile, the pair learn that Woody (Steve Guttenberg) is a child molester.  Synopsis  Aaron Echolls testifies in court and lies about the day of the murder. Veronica talks to Keith about her testimony. Gia (Krysten Ritter) invites Veronica to her house, and she agrees. Veronica bemoans her academic situation to Jackie (Tessa Thompson) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III). Weevil (Francis Capra) asks Veronica for help on his finals, but she denies him. Lucky (James Jordan) comes into the lunch area and starts shooting a gun. He points the gun at Jackie before \\"shooting\\" Wallace, although his gun has no bullets. A police officer appears and actually shoots Lucky in the back. Woody answers the press's questions on the incident. Keith tells Veronica his plan to hack into Woody's email account, and Veronica says that she'll handle it when she's invited over. Logan visits Aaron in prison. At the Goodmans' house, Veronica hacks into the email account and reads an email that indicates that Woody molested several children. Suddenly, Woody walks in on her and threatens her. Later, Keith deduces that one voice in the video has been edited out. Veronica testifies against Aaron in court, but her testimony is considered invalidated when they bring up Veronica's chlamydia. Leonard Lobo tells Sheriff Lamb that he was with Terrence at the time of the accident. Beaver fails to teach Weevil algebra before Mac takes over. Keith tells Woody to clear his house in response to a bomb threat and tells his finding that Woody is a molester, but Woody threatens him. Terrence is released, but Leonard appears and says that he fabricated his testimony to make Terrence indebted to him. Logan tells Veronica that Lucky acted weirdly in response to his time as a batboy for the sharks. Keith testifies in court, but he is also considered invalidated when he grabs the attorney. Beaver and Mac continue their education of Weevil. Veronica learns that Lucky's little league team was called the Sharks and that two of boys who died in the bus crash were on the team. Woody's house is searched and there was a bomb under his car. Veronica and Keith present their theory that Woody is the culprit to Sheriff Lamb, but he counters by saying that Lucky probably did it and that they are trying to make him look bad. Logan gives a moving testimony against Aaron. Two boys identify Weevil as the attacker on Thumper. Keith tells Sheriff Lamb that Lucky was in a cell at a VA at the time of the bus crash. Weevil passes his test, and Wallace finishes his final high school test. Jackie leaves for France, and Veronica skips a test to hear the Aaron Echolls verdict. Woody left town the previous morning. Aaron is cleared of all charges.  Cultural references  The following cultural references are made in the episode: *Aaron says that he was People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1987, when Harry Hamlin actually won. *Lucky refers to Gia in a manner similar to an advertisement for Chia Pets. *Keith refers to Post Office Protocol. *Gia mentions her MySpace account. *Veronica quotes a line from Waiting for Guffman. *Veronica says \\"Elementary, my dear Wallace\\" in reference to Sherlock Holmes.  Arc significance  Woody Goodman is revealed to be a child molester. Lucky brings a fake gun into school before he is shot by a police officer. Aaron Echolls, with the help of his lawyers and popular support, is acquitted of the murder of Lilly Kane.

Overview Preventive and active safety applications help drivers to avoid or mitigate accidents by using in-vehicle systems that sense the nature and significance of the danger, while taking the driver‚Äôs state into account. The PReVENT project is one of the largest initiative on road safety co-funded as an Integrated Project by the European Commission. The total budget amounts to more than ‚Ç¨55 million for a duration of 4 years starting from February 2004 to January 2008. It involves more than 50 European partners from the most prominent vehicle manufacturers and equipment suppliers (Tiers1) to the best intelligent vehicle research laboratories in Europe. Three general concepts have been followed throughout the PReVENT Integrated Project: The Virtual Safety Belt, the Time-To-Collision timescale and Three-layer architecture. The Virtual Safety Belt is the concept of integrating complementary safety functions in one vehicle. PReVENT partners have worked together to develop the virtual safety belt around the vehicle by: * developing a set of affordable, easy to deploy and complementary safety functions * using an integrated approach to increase system capabilities and achieve maximum benefit The virtual safety belt helps drivers to: * maintain a safe speed * keep a safe distance * drive within the lane * avoid overtaking in critical situations * safely pass intersections * avoid crashes with vulnerable road users * and last but not least, reduce the severity of an accident if it still occurs. The Time-To-Collision concept is a time scale of events preceding and following a crash or a critical situation. The safety function designers are using this timescale in order to create and harmonised progression of interventions and integration of preventive, active and passive safety. Depending on the significance and timing of the threat, the active and preventive safety systems will: * inform the driver as early as possible * warn him or her if there is no driver reaction to the information, and * actively assist or ultimately intervene in order to avoid an accident or mitigate its consequences. The three layer architecture for intelligent vehicles, namely Perception-Decision-Action, is an application integration concept. The Perception layer fuses together the information from the vehicle sensors in order to bring better and more reliable perception of the environment. It then passes this information to a decision layer which centralises and keeps track of all potential threats around the vehicle. Finally, the Action layer receives a decision information and judges by itself how and when to trigger an information, warning or intervention for the driver. This simplified concept helps the design of intelligent vehicles by using one single reliable and precise source of perception of the environment including the vehicle itself and avoid multiple alerts or conflicting messages displayed to the driver. A major display of the results of the PReVENT project took place in September 2007 together with the i2010: Intelligent Car Initiative 2007 event and the eSafety Forum.

The magazine was founded in 1972 in Australia; the Australia and New Zealand editions were discontinued in February 2016. Aimed at an older audience than the teenage-focused Australian magazine Dolly, Cleo was published by Bauer Media Group in Sydney and was known for its Cleo Bachelor of the Year award. In June 2020, Cleo was acquired by the Sydney investment firm Mercury Capital. History and profile Launched in November 1972 under the direction of Ita Buttrose, the magazine's founding editor, Cleo became one of Australia's most iconic titles due to its mix of seemingly controversial content, including the first nude male centerfold (following American Cosmopolitan's nude centerfold of Burt Reynolds six months' earlier) and detailed sex advice. According to the magazine's editorial philosophy, \\"Cleo gets women, and it also strikes the perfect balance, offers a bright, light- hearted tone and aesthetic without shying away from the more serious issues that are important to their readers.\\". Audited circulation in June 2014 was 53,221 copies monthly. Readership numbers for September 2014 are estimated to be 173,000. With a strong online presence of 300,000+ visitors monthly, the magazine successfully established its brand online. In addition, Beauty Bites, Cleo's digital app, offered an interactive component to technologically minded Gen Y readers, including how-to video tutorials, expert advice and reader- generated content. Cleo Singapore was launched in 1994, Cleo Malaysia in 1995, and Cleo Indonesia was launched in 2007 as an international license under the Femina Group. Cleo Thailand operated sometime before 2014.https://web.archive.org/web/20190409175802/http://www.cleothailand.com/ Bauer announced on 20 January 2016 that the March issue of Cleo would be its last Australian edition.ABC 20 January 2016 Launch In the early 1970s, journalist and editor, Ita Buttrose, and Kerry Packer, heir to what was then Australia's most influential publishing house, Australian Consolidated Press (ACP), created a new and bold Australian women's magazine which would become an instant sensation. Cleo was modelled in a large part on Cosmopolitan after the Packers lost the rights to the latter title to rivals Fairfax. The first issue was launched in November 1972, the same month that Gough Whitlam came to power in Australia. In the original promotional video for Cleo, Buttrose observes \\"the rapidly changing personality of the Australian woman.\\" In an era when hopes for social and political change were high, Cleo was a fitting and welcome addition for women aged between 20 and 40 who were looking for something more than the recipes, knitting tips and coverage of royal births and weddings that the Australian Women's Weekly focused on at the time. Cleo was politically provocative (but not aggressive) with its journalism. Alongside articles on group sex, contraception, \\"happy hookers\\" and Jack Thompson as the first nude \\"Mate of the Month\\", the launch issue featured tips on \\"How to be a sexy housekeeper.\\" In stark contrast to the lack of literary content in modern glossy magazines, Buttrose ran a short story by Norman Mailer, a prominent author at the time. This trend continued in subsequent issues. In two days, 105,000 copies of the first issue were sold and by the end of its first year circulation reached 200,000. When the magazine conducted the first national readership survey in 1974, figures revealed that 30 percent of women aged between 13 and 24 read Cleo every month. Cleo as a form of popular feminism Through Cleo, feminism became a part of women's everyday lives and of their identity. Ita Buttrose and her staff were committed to many of the ideas of women's and sexual liberation. However, it is important to note that Cleo's editorial agenda was that of liberal rather than radical feminism. In her first editorial letter, Buttrose described who she thought the Cleo reader was: \\"You're an intelligent woman who's interested in everything that's going on, the type of person who wants a great deal more out of life. Like us, certain aspects of Women's Lib appeal to you but you're not aggressive about it.\\" (1972). The feminist tone and ideas proliferated on the pages of Cleo throughout the 1970s. Every month, there were feature articles covering issues including: the work/life balance, the pressure to get married and raise a family, abortion, contraception, women's education, domestic violence and rape. \\"The celebrities Cleo chose to interview were women who had succeeded in politics, business and culture. There were also discussions of the Women's Liberation Movement itself, with writers for and against\\". Ordinary, every-day women gained knowledge and understanding of feminism through the pages of Cleo. The magazine helped create the feminist public sphere, opening doors for discussions about new ideas which modern women treat as mainstream today. =Cleo jump starts the sexual revolution= Cleo pushed boundaries in mainstream publishing with candid articles on topics ranging from sex toys, fantasies and orgasms, to lesbianism and contraception. \\"We wrote about sex as if we had discovered it\\", recalls Buttrose. Cleo was the first Australian women's magazine to feature non-frontal nude male centrefolds in 1972, with Jack Thomson, a prominent Australian actor at the time, the magazine's first Mate of the Month. What Buttrose thought would be a light hearted, one-off feature became an essential component of what made Cleo so popular. Other mates were Alby Mangels, Eric Oldfield, Peter Blasina and the band Skyhooks. The centrefold feature was discontinued in 1985, the last being a bare-chested picture of Mel Gibson. University of Sydney media academic Megan Le Masurier interprets the centerfold phenomenon as an incentive for popular feminist desire. The centerfold attempted to reverse the dominant tradition of representing men as viewers, and women as viewed. The representation of the male nude \\"offered women the chance to imagine themselves as active sexual agents, quite capable of holding the gaze\\". The naked man was a reminder that women could, and should, enjoy sex, and reaffirmed their right to talk about sex. Sex no longer sells In 2013, new editor Sharri Markson announced there would be no mention of sex on the cover of Cleo. More than 40 years after revamping women's magazines with male centrefolds, it was the first time that sex had not been used as a selling point. The move came as a result of research conducted by the magazine which revealed a conservative streak among Generation Y readers ‚Äì Cleo's largest audience demographic ‚Äì most of whom still live at home. As Markson explained: \\"They are embarrassed to be sitting at home with their parents reading a magazine which has the word 'orgasm' in bold print on the cover\\". In the pages of Cleo, all the racy content of the earlier, more progressive era was replaced with celebrity news and fashion, beauty and fitness tips. Now sexy, according to December 2014 cover girl Taylor Swift is \\"knowing who you are and not needing to defend yourself.\\" As seen through the pages of Cleo, there was a shift away from sexual liberation to personal gratification and self- improvement, a maxim characteristic of Generation Y. Bauer: new owner, new direction In October 2012, multinational publisher Bauer Media purchased Australian magazine publisher ACP, which controls titles ranging from Cleo magazine to The Australian Women's Weekly This change of ownership meant drastic changes for the staff and readers of Cleo magazine. =Merge of editorial staff: Dolly and Cleo= A primary cost-cutting measure taken by Bauer was to merge the editorial staff of Dolly and Cleo magazines, reducing the staff size by half and appointing a single Editor-in-Chief for both magazines. This was presented as a move to unite the two magazines under a \\"young women's lifestyles division\\". Observers argue that these two magazines are in fact not directed at the same generalised market. Where Dolly targets teenage girls, Cleo focuses on an older group, women in their twenties and thirties. =Imported content= Bauer Media also now uses \\"content translated from Bauer's youth titles Joy and Bravo which the publishing house produce in Germany\\", reducing the amount of original Australian content across the magazines, but reducing the cost of producing issues across their titles. =Lucy Cousins appointed Editor-in-Chief= In 2014, Lucy Cousins was appointed Editor-in-Chief of Bauer's newly merged Dolly and Cleo magazines. Cousins was previously employed as Deputy Editor at Bauer's Women's Fitness magazine. Cousins says of Cleo magazine: \\"CLEO magazine is and has always been a bible of all things fashion, beauty and celebrity for young Australian women. And now we've added travel, lifestyle, music and the new CLEO man section. We have attitude and aren't afraid to push the boundaries.\\" =Past editors' opinions on Bauer's changes= Mia Freedman: \\"Like most Australian women, Dolly and Cleo in particular were my lifeblood growing up and sparked my love of women's media back in the 80s and 90s. [I'm] frustrated and disappointed at the lack of business foresight that has brought those titles to this point. One of the reasons I left magazines was because I was so tired of trying to get my bosses to understand that Armageddon was coming in the form of online. I knew the young women's market was the most vulnerable. But nobody would listen so I left and started Mamamia...Publishers didn't realise they were content producers, they kept acting like magazine makers\\" Lisa Wilkinson on Twitter: \\"Very sad to hear news that Dolly & Cleo magazines are merging, with expected losses of half the staff. End of an era. And a personal one.\\" Wilkinson believes that it will take \\"somebody who is an incredibly smart magazine editor and someone who understands the subtle but very important differences that are going to have to exist between those two magazines\\" to ensure the survival of both Dolly and Cleo magazines. =Readership figures 2013‚Äì14= It appears that Bauer's changes have not improved the continuing drop in circulation of Cleo magazine. Cleo has suffered a steady decline in circulation in recent years due to changes in the way media is consumed and the failure of publishers in the 1990s and 2000s (decade) to follow their readers online. Most recent figures show Cleo suffered a 28.2% drop between September 2013 and September 2014, with a readership size of 173,000 in September 2014. Bauer Media however argues that it has experienced a 100% increase in \\"social media growth\\" in that time period, suggesting that indeed the reason why readership figures are falling is due to the movement from print media to the online world of blogs, forums and Facebook, and the best that Bauer Media can do to ensure the continuation of Australian magazines like Cleo is to minimise its production costs and hope that it can catch up with digital media. =Final issue 2016= On 20 January 2016, Bauer Media Group confirmed that Cleo magazine would close in Australia after more than 40 years of publication, with the final issue being March, on sale 22 February. Cleo magazine's final cover, for the March edition, would feature Jesinta Campbell. =Mercury Capital acquisition= In June 2020, Cleo was acquired by the Sydney investment firm Mercury Capital as part of its acquisition of several of Bauer Media's former Australian and New Zealand titles. Noteworthy editors =Ita Buttrose= Ita Buttrose Ita Buttrose's media career is ground breaking. Starting as a copy girl at the Australian Women's Weekly, she quickly became a cadet journalist at the Daily Telegraph and its sister newspaper Sunday Telegraph before taking over as women's editor at the age of 23. Buttrose would go on to become the first female Editor-in- Chief of these two newspapers and the first woman appointed to the board position with News Limited. But her most famous role began in 1972, as the founding editor of Cleo magazine where she achieved such great success that it led to a promotion in 1975, editing the Packers' flagship magazine at the time, the Australian Women's Weekly. She subsequently became editor-in-chief of both publications. Buttrose played an important role in shaping women's identity in the 1970s through the pages of Cleo. She had the talent and conviction to take advantage of this period of social and political change, with new ideas about sexual freedom, female independence and gender equality heavily promoted in her magazine. Despite scepticism from Sir Frank Packer, the Publisher, Buttrose's hunch that Cleo would appeal to modern Australian women proved to be right, with the magazine becoming the top selling monthly women's title and elevating Buttrose to the status of a feminist icon and magazine queen. Andrew Cowell, the art director on the debut edition of Cleo said: \\"Ita's always had a talent to tap into a real need. She's always been a forward thinker, which keeps her ahead of the curve and able to make instinctive decisions. If Ita had a gut feeling for something, you were best to go with it.\\" Since 2011, Buttrose has been National President of Alzheimer's Australia and is also Vice-President of Arthritis Australia. In 2013, she was named Australian of the Year. Buttrose uses her high-profile to champion social issues such as women's education and raise awareness of breast cancer and HIV/AIDS. =Lisa Wilkinson= Lisa Wilkinson Lisa Wilkinson's career in magazine publishing started at age 19 with no university education, as the enthusiastic secretary/editorial assistant/Girl Friday at Dolly magazine. After rising to the editorship of Dolly in only 5 years, Wilkinson took over the position of Cleo magazine editor in 1984, and reigned there for ten years. Later she became Cleo's International Editor-in-Chief, running editions in New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Under Wilkinson, Cleo magazine became the highest selling women's magazine per capita in the world. A significant change made by Wilkinson at Cleo was the replacement of the Cleo centerfold with the Bachelor of the Year competition in 1985. Cleo magazine presents an annual round up of the 50 most eligible bachelors in Australia, and encourages readers to vote for their favourite eligible bachelor. Wilkinson also mentored numerous high-profile women in Australian media today. Nicole Kidman, Miranda Kerr, Deborah Thomas, Paula Joye and Mia Freedman all credit her as a long-time supporter. After her career as a magazine editor, Wilkinson established her own media consultancy business and hosted breakfast talk show Today on the Nine Network, with Karl Stefanovic, before joining A Current Affair's program The Project on Network Ten =Deborah Thomas= Thomas in January 2013 Deborah Thomas' career in magazine publishing started at Cleo magazine as Beauty and Lifestyle editor in 1987. She became deputy editor at Cleo in 1990, and was editor at Mode (now Harper's Bazaar) and Elle magazines until she took over the Editorship at Cleo from 1997 to 1999 where she \\"revive[d] the magazine's falling circulation and advertising revenue\\". After Cleo magazine, Thomas became Editor-in-Chief of The Australian Women's Weekly and was awarded Editor of the Year in 2002 for her efforts at the iconic magazine. Later, Thomas was Director of Media, Public Affairs and Brand Development across Bauer Media's portfolio of 70-plus titles. In April 2015 she was appointed as CEO (chief executive officer) of Ardent Leisure. =Mia Freedman= Mia Freedman's first foray into magazine publishing was also at Cleo ‚Äì doing work experience under then-editor Lisa Wilkinson. Freedman became the youngest ever editor of Cosmopolitan magazine at age 24, and at 32 became Editor-in-Chief of Dolly, Cleo and Cosmo. Freedman moved away from magazine publishing in 2007 and is now the publisher and editor behind popular women's interest website Mamamia, while continuing to write articles and books across numerous publications. = Sarah Oakes = Sarah Oakes is an experienced editor who has worked on a number of Australian publications such as K-Zone and Girlfriend and received many accolades throughout her career. She was the youngest ever recipient of the Magazine Publishers' Awards, Editor of the Year Award in 2005. Oakes was the editor-in- chief of Cleo between 2008 and 2010, where she repositioned the title and had great success with the Cleo 'Bachelor of the Year' campaigns. While at Cleo, Oakes was also a finalist in the Good Editor Awards. Oakes currently holds the position of editor of Sunday Life, a Fairfax publication that has a readership of more than 1.6 million.  Oakes' innovative changes for Cleo  = New editorial line-up = Oakes presided over the relaunch and repositioning of Cleo in October 2009. She has signed-up a veteran magazine editor and fashion stylist Aileen Marr as the new Fashion Director and Pip Edwards as Contributing Fashion Editor. The October issue in 2008 hence started to feature more fashion pages up front, introduce new sections and launch more beauty pages, including a market-first beauty panel. Such a strong fashion editorial team cemented Cleo's status as an invaluable source of information for women who want to stay on top of fashion trends. = \\"Models only\\" policy overturned = Oakes also brought celebrities back to the Cleo cover instead of \\"models only\\" policy introduced in the late 2007. = New \\"honesty policy\\" = Introduced in the August 2008 issue, this policy was designed to appeal to Generation Y, with readers invited to critique each issue in return for prizes such as iPhones and designer bags. As then editor Oakes explained, \\"Every month we will ask our readers online to give feedback (which will be) incorporated into the magazine the following month. We are doing all the things that motivate Generation Y: instant gratification and personalisation.\\" = Sales trend = Cleo experienced an Average Net Paid Sales (ANPS) decline from 149,256 in 2008 to 134,286 in 2009, with a rate dropped by ‚àí10.03% and the number of copies sold decreased by 14,970-year-on- year. Meanwhile, the cover price of Cleo increased by $0.2 from $7.00 in 2008 to $7.20 in 2009. The circulation of Cleo decreased from 128,183 in 2009 to 110,081 in 2010. In popular culture ABC mini-series, Paper Giants: The Birth of Cleo dramatises the emergence of the magazine. Screened over two nights in April 2011, the series was a ratings winner, with an average of 1.34 million viewers tuning in on the opening night to watch Ita Buttrose (played by Asher Keddie) navigate the male dominated world of Australian publishing in the 1970s as she fights to get Cleo off the ground. For many avid readers of Cleo, the idea that the magazine almost did not exist made for exciting television. Most critics praised Asher Keddie's convincing portrayal of Buttrose as an ambitious leader and supportive mentor. According to producer John Edwards, Buttrose was a significant contributor to the script. \\"When I went to meet her, she was tentative, nervous and fearful but also flattered\\". =Feminist representational techniques= Academic Margaret Henderson argues that just as Cleo made feminist ideas popular, Paper Giants uses \\"feminist representational techniques\\" to make the 1970s era of social and political change accessible to modern audiences. For many avid readers of Cleo, the idea that the magazine almost did not exist made for exciting television. A feminist approach to relationships is shown through the many scenes of the staff gathered around the table brainstorming. The impression given is that the evolution of editorial ideas is very much a collective work process, and the women's relationship to each other is supportive rather than competitive. The typical Cleo reader is represented by Ita's shy assistant, Leslie (played by Jessica Tovey) who begins the series faking orgasms and running errands, and by the end, escapes her dead-end relationship to begin working as a journalist in London. Women's sexual liberation is highlighted in playful tones. There is plenty of joking, bantering, and double entendres among the female characters who use humour to deal with obstacles that come their way from the suits upstairs when creating the magazine. When we are shown the discomfort expressed by Kerry Packer (played by Rob Carlton) and Sir Frank when the female staff have frank discussions with them regarding the sexual content of Cleo, the scene is meant to be funny. \\"Paper Giants' recruitment of humour‚Ä¶is an important corrective to the clich√© of humourless feminists and to po-faced and hubristic accounts of radical political movements\\".

The hypothesis can be seen to arise as a natural consequence of the block-spin renormalization procedure, when the block size is chosen to be of the same size as the correlation length.Kerson Huang, Statistical Mechanics. John Wiley and Sons, 1987 Widom scaling is an example of universality.  Definitions  The critical exponents \\\\alpha, \\\\alpha', \\\\beta, \\\\gamma, \\\\gamma' and \\\\delta are defined in terms of the behaviour of the order parameters and response functions near the critical point as follows : M(t,0) \\\\simeq (-t)^{\\\\beta}, for t \\\\uparrow 0 : M(0,H) \\\\simeq H^{1/ \\\\delta} \\\\mathrm{sign}(H), for H \\\\rightarrow 0 : \\\\chi_T(t,0) \\\\simeq \\\\begin{cases} (t)^{-\\\\gamma}, & \\\\textrm{for} \\\\ t \\\\downarrow 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (-t)^{-\\\\gamma'}, & \\\\textrm{for} \\\\ t \\\\uparrow 0 \\\\end{cases} : c_H(t,0) \\\\simeq \\\\begin{cases} (t)^{-\\\\alpha} & \\\\textrm{for} \\\\ t \\\\downarrow 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (-t)^{-\\\\alpha'} & \\\\textrm{for} \\\\ t \\\\uparrow 0 \\\\end{cases} where : t \\\\equiv \\\\frac{T-T_c}{T_c} measures the temperature relative to the critical point. Near the critical point, Widom's scaling relation reads : H(t) \\\\simeq MM^{\\\\delta-1} f(t/M^{1/\\\\beta}). where f has an expansion : f(t/M^{1/\\\\beta})\\\\approx 1+{\\\\rm const}\\\\times( t/M^{1/\\\\beta})^\\\\omega +\\\\dots , with \\\\omega being Wegner's exponent governing the approach to scaling.  Derivation  The scaling hypothesis is that near the critical point, the free energy f(t,H), in d dimensions, can be written as the sum of a slowly varying regular part f_r and a singular part f_s, with the singular part being a scaling function, i.e., a homogeneous function, so that : f_s(\\\\lambda^p t, \\\\lambda^q H) = \\\\lambda^d f_s(t, H) \\\\, Then taking the partial derivative with respect to H and the form of M(t,H) gives : \\\\lambda^q M(\\\\lambda^p t, \\\\lambda^q H) = \\\\lambda^d M(t, H) \\\\, Setting H=0 and \\\\lambda = (-t)^{-1/p} in the preceding equation yields : M(t,0) = (-t)^{\\\\frac{d-q}{p}} M(-1,0), for t \\\\uparrow 0 Comparing this with the definition of \\\\beta yields its value, : \\\\beta = \\\\frac{d-q}{p}\\\\equiv \\\\frac{ u}2(d-2+\\\\eta). Similarly, putting t=0 and \\\\lambda = H^{-1/q} into the scaling relation for M yields : \\\\delta = \\\\frac{q}{d-q} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{d+2-\\\\eta}{d-2+\\\\eta}. Hence : \\\\frac{q}{p} = \\\\frac{ u}{2} (d+2-\\\\eta),~\\\\frac 1 p= u. Applying the expression for the isothermal susceptibility \\\\chi_T in terms of M to the scaling relation yields : \\\\lambda^{2q} \\\\chi_T (\\\\lambda^p t, \\\\lambda^q H) = \\\\lambda^d \\\\chi_T (t, H) \\\\, Setting H=0 and \\\\lambda = (t)^{-1/p} for t \\\\downarrow 0 (resp. \\\\lambda = (-t)^{-1/p} for t \\\\uparrow 0 ) yields : \\\\gamma = \\\\gamma' = \\\\frac{2q -d}{p} \\\\, Similarly for the expression for specific heat c_H in terms of M to the scaling relation yields : \\\\lambda^{2p} c_H ( \\\\lambda^p t, \\\\lambda^q H) = \\\\lambda^d c_H(t, H) \\\\, Taking H=0 and \\\\lambda = (t)^{-1/p} for t \\\\downarrow 0 (or \\\\lambda = (-t)^{-1/p} for t \\\\uparrow 0) yields : \\\\alpha = \\\\alpha' = 2 -\\\\frac{d}{p}=2- u d As a consequence of Widom scaling, not all critical exponents are independent but they can be parameterized by two numbers p, q \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} with the relations expressed as : \\\\alpha = \\\\alpha' = 2- u d, : \\\\gamma = \\\\gamma' = \\\\beta(\\\\delta -1)= u(2-\\\\eta) .

She competed in the Miss Teen USA and Miss USA pageants. In addition to her pageantry career, she participated as a HouseGuest on the 15th season of the American reality show Big Brother. While in the Big Brother house, Stewart received national attention after becoming a victim of racism from fellow HouseGuests Aaryn Williams and GinaMarie Zimmerman. She became the first member of the Big Brother jury house that season. Pageant career She captured the Miss Louisiana Teen USA 2002 crown in the state pageant held in Lafayette in late 2001. Stewart then represented Louisiana at the 2002 pageant held at South Padre Island, Texas in August 2002. The pageant was won by Vanessa Semrow of Wisconsin. In 2003, just a year after passing on her Teen crown, Stewart returned to the Louisiana pageant stage, placing first runner- up to Melissa McConnell in the Miss Louisiana USA 2004 pageant. She won the pageant the following year, on her second attempt, and was the first African American woman to win this title. In April 2005, Stewart competed in the Miss USA 2005 pageant televised live from Baltimore, Maryland. The pageant was won by Chelsea Cooley of North Carolina, who had been Miss North Carolina Teen USA 2000. Stewart was a speech pathology major at Xavier University and was once a dancer for the New Orleans Saints. She was due to give up her crown in November 2005, but the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in her state meant the pageant was postponed until January 2006. Her successor was Christina Cuenca of Arabi, who had placed in both years Stewart had competed. Appearance on Big Brother  In 2013, Stewart was selected to appear on the American reality television series Big Brother 15 as a contestant (HouseGuest). On Day 5, McCrae nominated Candice and Jessie for eviction, feeling as though they were the least-liked people in the house. However, McCrae used the Power of Veto to remove Candice from the block, and chose to nominate Elissa in her place. Aaryn choose Candice along with Andy, Elissa, and Helen to be the Have-Nots for the second week. She once again became one of the Have-Nots during week four and five. During week five, Stewart was selected to compete for the Power of Veto competition; however, Spencer won the Power of Veto. On Day 39, Spencer used the Power of Veto to remove himself from the block, with Candice being nominated in his place in an attempt to ensure Howard's eviction. Jessie and Candice, believing that Amanda and McCrae were in control of the game, attempted to get the votes to evict Amanda from the house, though this plan failed. As a result, Candice and Jessie became outcasts in the house, and became the targets for several HouseGuests. During week six, Candice won a $5,000 prize. GinaMarie and her allies decided to target Candice and Jessie for eviction, hoping to see Candice be evicted from the house. On Day 43, GinaMarie chose to nominate Candice and Jessie for eviction. Candice lost the Veto competition and had to wear a \\"Clownitard\\" for a week. They also learned that this season would feature nine Jury members, rather than seven. Candice then became the sixth HouseGuest to be evicted when she received seven eviction votes (7-0-0). She became the first member of the Jury of Nine. During her time in the house, Stewart formed a friendship with Howard Overby. Because of their racial background, she and Overby were the targets of racist comments from fellow HouseGuests, particularly Aaryn Gries and GinaMarie Zimmerman. At one point, Gries said, ‚ÄúBe careful what you say in the dark; you might not be able to see that bitch.\\" Later in the season, during a Veto Competition (where nominees compete for the \\"Power of Veto\\", and the holder can decide whether to change the nominations), Stewart got into a dispute with HouseGuest Amanda Zuckerman. Stewart whispered to HouseGuest Judd Daugherty, \\"They [Zuckerman and her alliance members] think you're the MVP.\\" Zuckerman caught this and started taunting Stewart, calling her \\"Shaniqua\\". This was followed by, \\"Oh, am I racist now? I'm racist now!\\" In a double eviction on Day 49, Stewart was evicted from the house, placing 11th. During her eviction speech, she stated that \\"this week, the game got personal\\" and called out fellow HouseGuest GinaMarie for \\"saying defamatory comments\\", which sparked an argument. HouseGuest Spencer Clawson then started his eviction speech in an attempt to settle the two women down after Big Brother host Julie Chen failed to assuage the dispute. After her eviction, Stewart became the first member of the Jury, meaning she was able to influence the game through voting for the winner. Personal life In 2006, Stewart earned a bachelor's degree in speech-language pathology and audiology from Xavier University of Louisiana. Previously, she was a cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints.

Dating from the late nineteenth century the regiment provided the title and setting for a widely read novel, King of the Khyber Rifles. History A member of the Khyber Rifles,1946. =Origins and early commanders= During the period of British rule, the Khyber Rifles was one of eight \\"Frontier Corps\\" or paramilitary units recruited from the tribesmen of the North West Frontier, serving as auxiliaries for the regular British Indian Army. Raised in the early 1880s as the Khyber Jezailchis; (a jezail being a type of home made musket), the Khyber Rifles recruited from Afridi tribesmen, with British commanders seconded from regular British Indian army regiments. Subordinate officers were Afridis. The first commandant was Sir Robert Warburton, son of an Anglo-Irish soldier Robert Warburton of the Bengal Artillery and his wife Shah Jehan Begum, an Afghan princess. Sir Robert remained the commandant until his retirement in 1899. His deputy, Colonel Sir Aslam Khan Sadozai, the first Muslim commandant, succeeded him. Then, the deputy to Colonel Sir Aslam Khan Sadozai was Malik Afridi Khan of Mulazai. Although the deputy, Malik Afridi Khan spent most of his time as the acting in charge of the Khyber Rifles due to the extensive leave of Sir Aslam.An officer of the Khyber Rifles giving orders to his sepoys in 1895. =Locations= The headquarters of the Khyber Rifles was at Landi Kotal. Its prime role was to guard the Khyber Pass. The three main garrisons of the regiment were Landi Kotal, at the western end of the Pass, Fort Maude to the east, and Ali Masjid in the centre. =Insignia and uniform= The badge of the Corps comprised two crossed Afghan daggers with the words KHYBER above and RIFLES below. While the Indian Army as a whole was noted for its colourful and elaborate dress uniforms prior to 1914, the various units of the Frontier Corps wore only plain khaki drill uniforms and turbans. =19th Century campaigns= The regiment saw active service in the Black Mountain expeditions of 1888 and 1891, during a period when the Khyber Pass itself remained peaceful. In August 1897 however, the Khyber Afridi tribes rose and the three forts garrisoned by the Khyber Rifles were overrun, the survivors falling back to Jamrud. It took four months and forty-four thousand troops for the British to retake the Khyber Pass. The Khyber Rifles were reconstituted and resumed their garrisons at Landi Kotal, Fort Maude and Ali Masjid. Khyber Rifles. Watercolour by Maj AC Lovett, 1910. =Disbandment and Re- establishment= During the Third Anglo-Afghan War (1919), the loyalty of the Khyber Rifles was put under heavy strain and there were a number of desertions. The regiment was therefore disbanded as unreliable. Of the serving personnel 1,180 opted to be discharged, while smaller numbers transferred to a military police battalion or were formed into a newly raised Khyber Levy Corps.John Gaylor: \\"Sons of John Company - the Indian & Pakistan Armies 1903‚Äì1991\\" page 310; The Khyber Rifles was however reconstituted from Afridi veterans of World War II in 1946, with its headquarters at Landi Kotal. The commander of the reborn regiment was himself an Afridi, Sharif Khan. Modern Khyber Rifles Shagai Fort, headquarters of the Khyber Rifles. In August 1947, upon partition, the Khyber Rifles and the other Frontier Corps regiments were transferred to Pakistan.

Education and teaching career Butterfield was educated at Whitcliffe Mount Grammar School, Cleckheaton and Loughborough College, where he took a BSc. in Physical Education in 1951. He later took up a teaching post at Wellingborough Grammar School in Northamptonshire, after which he became a science master at Worksop College. Rugby career Butterfield began his senior rugby career with Northampton Saints and played for them 227 times.Northampton Saints Hall of Fame In addition to his duties at Northampton he also played 54 times for Yorkshire and captained them in two County Championship finals, in 1953 and 1957. He is considered to have been one of the most gifted centres to have played Rugby for England and was capped 28 times and captained the team four times. He was first capped by England in 1953 against France; here he played with a fellow Northampton player Lew Cannell. Butterfield played for England for 6 years, including 28 successive matches ‚Äì in his final season he was captain. Butterfield became England's most capped back, and on his watch, England won the Five Nations' Championship four times, the Triple Crown twice and a Grand Slam. As well as playing for Northampton and England, Butterfield is celebrated for his play on the 1955 British Lions tour to South Africa where he scored tries in three of the four test matches. He later toured with the Lions in New Zealand in 1959 but here he was plagued by an injury and was unable to play in any of the matches. Butterfield was influenced as a player by the Bradford Northern Rugby League club whom he used to watch as a child. He used to watch the pre-war international outside half, Willie Davies. Of him, Butterfield said, \\"Willie always carried the ball in front of him with both hands. Though he always continued to run straight when he passed. I modelled my technique on his.\\" One of the most memorable features of Butterfield's game was his near-perfect timing of a pass. Later life After retiring from full-time rugby, Butterfield briefly worked the paint industry and later opened the Rugby Club in Hallam Street, London, which he and his wife, Barbara, ran for 25 years.The Daily Telegraph obituary Butterfield and his family also enjoyed skiing. His later years were dogged by ill health.

The model is notable for having nontrivial interactions, yet having an analytical solution. The model was solved by Lars Onsager for the special case that the external magnetic field H = 0.() An analytical solution for the general case for H eq 0 has yet to be found. Definition of the model Consider the 2D Ising model on a square lattice \\\\Lambda with N sites, with periodic boundary conditions in both the horizontal and vertical directions, which effectively reduces the topology of the model to a torus. In a general case, the horizontal coupling J is not equal to the coupling in the vertical direction, J*. With an equal number of rows and columns in the lattice, there will be N of each. In terms of : K = \\\\beta J : L = \\\\beta J^{*} where \\\\beta = \\\\frac{1}{kT} where T is absolute temperature and k is Boltzmann's constant, the partition function Z_N(K,L) is given by : Z_N(K,L) = \\\\sum_{\\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma\\\\\\\\}} \\\\exp \\\\left( K \\\\sum_{\\\\langle ij \\\\rangle_H} \\\\sigma_i \\\\sigma_j + L \\\\sum_{\\\\langle ij \\\\rangle_V} \\\\sigma_i \\\\sigma_j \\\\right). Critical temperature The critical temperature T_c can be obtained from the Kramers‚ÄìWannier duality relation. Denoting the free energy per site as F(K,L), one has: :\\\\beta F\\\\left(K^{*}, L^{*}\\\\right) = \\\\beta F\\\\left(K,L\\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\log\\\\left[\\\\sinh\\\\left(2K\\\\right)\\\\sinh\\\\left(2L\\\\right)\\\\right] where : \\\\sinh\\\\left(2K^{*}\\\\right)\\\\sinh\\\\left(2L\\\\right)=1 : \\\\sinh\\\\left(2L^{*}\\\\right)\\\\sinh\\\\left(2K\\\\right)=1 Assuming there is only one critical line in the (K,L) plane, the duality relation implies that this is given by: :\\\\sinh\\\\left(2 K\\\\right)\\\\sinh\\\\left(2 L\\\\right)= 1 For the isotropic case J = J^{*}, one finds the famous relation for the critical temperature T_{c} :\\\\frac{k T_c}{J} = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\ln(1+\\\\sqrt{2})} \\\\approx 2.26918531421 Dual lattice Consider a configuration of spins \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sigma \\\\\\\\} on the square lattice \\\\Lambda . Let r and s denote the number of unlike neighbours in the vertical and horizontal directions respectively. Then the summand in Z_N corresponding to \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sigma \\\\\\\\} is given by : e^{K(N-2s) +L(N-2r)} Dual lattice Construct a dual lattice \\\\Lambda_D as depicted in the diagram. For every configuration \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sigma \\\\\\\\} , a polygon is associated to the lattice by drawing a line on the edge of the dual lattice if the spins separated by the edge are unlike. Since by traversing a vertex of \\\\Lambda the spins need to change an even number of times so that one arrives at the starting point with the same charge, every vertex of the dual lattice is connected to an even number of lines in the configuration, defining a polygon. Spin configuration on a dual lattice This reduces the partition function to : Z_N(K,L) = 2e^{N(K+L)} \\\\sum_{P \\\\subset \\\\Lambda_D} e^{-2Lr-2Ks} summing over all polygons in the dual lattice, where r and s are the number of horizontal and vertical lines in the polygon, with the factor of 2 arising from the inversion of spin configuration. Low-temperature expansion At low temperatures, K, L approach infinity, so that as T \\\\rightarrow 0, \\\\ \\\\ e^{-K}, e^{-L} \\\\rightarrow 0 , so that : Z_N(K,L) = 2 e^{N(K+L)} \\\\sum_{ P \\\\subset \\\\Lambda_D} e^{-2Lr-2Ks} defines a low temperature expansion of Z_N(K,L) . High-temperature expansion Since \\\\sigma \\\\sigma' = \\\\pm 1 one has : e^{K \\\\sigma \\\\sigma'} = \\\\cosh K + \\\\sinh K(\\\\sigma \\\\sigma') = \\\\cosh K(1+\\\\tanh K(\\\\sigma \\\\sigma')). Therefore : Z_N(K,L) = (\\\\cosh K \\\\cosh L)^N \\\\sum_{\\\\\\\\{ \\\\sigma \\\\\\\\}} \\\\prod_{\\\\langle ij \\\\rangle_H} (1+v \\\\sigma_i \\\\sigma_j) \\\\prod_{\\\\langle ij \\\\rangle_V}(1+w\\\\sigma_i \\\\sigma_j) where v =\\\\tanh K and w = \\\\tanh L . Since there are N horizontal and vertical edges, there are a total of 2^{2N} terms in the expansion. Every term corresponds to a configuration of lines of the lattice, by associating a line connecting i and j if the term v \\\\sigma_i \\\\sigma_j (or w \\\\sigma_i \\\\sigma_j) is chosen in the product. Summing over the configurations, using : \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma_i = \\\\pm 1} \\\\sigma_i^n = \\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\mbox{for } n \\\\mbox{ odd} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & \\\\mbox{for } n \\\\mbox{ even} \\\\end{cases} shows that only configurations with an even number of lines at each vertex (polygons) will contribute to the partition function, giving : Z_N(K,L) = 2^N(\\\\cosh K \\\\cosh L)^N \\\\sum_{P \\\\subset \\\\Lambda} v^r w^s where the sum is over all polygons in the lattice. Since tanh K, tanh L \\\\rightarrow 0 as T \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty , this gives the high temperature expansion of Z_N(K,L). The two expansions can be related using the Kramers‚ÄìWannier duality. Exact solution The free energy per site in the limit N\\\\to\\\\infty is given as follows. Define the parameter k as :k =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sinh\\\\left(2 K\\\\right)\\\\sinh\\\\left(2 L\\\\right)} The Helmholtz free energy per site F can be expressed as : -\\\\beta F = \\\\frac{\\\\log(2)}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\pi}\\\\log\\\\left[\\\\cosh\\\\left(2 K\\\\right)\\\\cosh\\\\left(2 L\\\\right)+\\\\frac{1}{k}\\\\sqrt{1+k^{2}-2k\\\\cos(2\\\\theta)}\\\\right]d\\\\theta For the isotropic case J = J^{*}, from the above expression one finds for the internal energy per site: : U = - J \\\\coth(2 \\\\beta J) \\\\left[ 1 + \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} (2 \\\\tanh^2(2 \\\\beta J) -1) \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 - 4 k (1+k)^{-2} \\\\sin^2(\\\\theta)}} d\\\\theta \\\\right] and the spontaneous magnetization is, for T < T_c, : M = \\\\left[ 1 - \\\\sinh^{-4}(2 \\\\beta J) \\\\right]^{1/8} References  * Stephen G.

Initially, the Foundation included The Touring Division, The Giving Program, and the Lake Champlain Initiative. The Lake Champlain Initiative continues to donate proceeds from the sale of Ben and Jerry's Phish Food ice cream to support the environmental well-being of Lake Champlain and its watershed. Lake Champlain Initiative Lake Champlain, a sizeable lake on the Vermont/New York border, is currently plagued by several major problems: an overabundance of phosphorus from sewage, agricultural/urban run-off, toxic waste, and invasions of non-native species. Over half of the lake is considered to be too polluted to be of full use, and yet sees over $1 billion in tourism each year. Fellow Vermonters Ben & Jerry's approached the band in 1995 regarding a flavor called Phish Food; Phish decided that they would donate all royalties to help Lake Champlain. WaterWheel has given away over $1 million to 29 organizations working on issues affecting Lake Champlain covering a wide variety of issues: land conservation, environmental advocacy, activism, education, and so forth. Phish drummer Jon Fishman said the band was inspired to found the Waterwheel Foundation by actor Paul Newman, who founded the Newman's Own food company and donated all profit from their products to charity. Touring Division The primary mission of WaterWheel's Touring Division is dedicated to raising funds for one selected non-profit in each community to which Phish toured. The proceeds from the sale of WaterWheel merchandise is donated directly to the organization table of the charity at that particular show. WaterWheel has donated over $400,000 to more than 189 organizations. During the band's hiatus (10/00 - 12/02), the Touring Division continued to tour with Trey Anastasio side-projects (Anastasio‚Äôs first project, Oysterhead). Original Touring Division directors Mike Hayes and Henry Schwab left the organization at the commencement of the hiatus. The division's activities were carried forward by Chris Prang & Matt Beck through the hiatus and into Phish's first two years back on the road. Local giving Comprising the organizations in which a band member takes a personal interest, Local Giving is concentrated on Vermont-based non-profits. Past recipients have included the Vermont Youth Orchestra, Women's Rape Crisis Center, Firehouse Center for the Visual Arts, The Flynn Center for the Performing Arts, and Vermont Public Television.

He is best known for coordinating the Unite Union campaign 'Supersizemypay.com', which targeted the fast food industry and advocated for the abolition of youth rates and for a $12 minimum wage, and the world's first Starbucks strike,http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0511/S00370.htm and for his involvement in the World Naked Bike Ride, on which he was arrested for indecent exposure. He also previously worked as a media liaison in Auckland for the National Distribution Union and the ShelfRespect.org supermarket pay campaign. Early years Oosterman grew up in Ramarama, an area south of Drury, and on a farm in Rerewhakaaitu, south of Rotorua. Simon and his siblings (twin brother Paul, older brother Jonathan, and sister Kate) were put through private schools by their mother Allison, a journalist and now lecturer of communications at AUT University in Auckland. She told Metro magazine that she wanted the best education for them and \\"remarkably\\" was able to send them to King's School (Jonathan), Southwell School (Paul & Simon), King's College (Jonathan, Paul, & Simon) and St Cuthbert's College (Kate), despite being on her own after she and her husband separated when the twins were nine months old. Oosterman studied for a bachelor's in sociology and women's studies but pulled out of a masters in environmental sociology to join an anti-war protest. Activism He has been a prominent animal rights and anti-genetic engineering activist, and has been involved in climate change issues. Oosterman is credited with organising the 'Supersizemypay.com' campaign for the world's first Starbucks strike, as well as coining the name and designing its website. Oosterman's first public protest was in 2003 with a week-long sit-in in downtown Auckland outside the US embassy. He, his brother Jonathan, and other activists, were protesting US actions in Iraq. That same year he was involved in an anti-vivisection protest in Christchurch where he lay in front of a bus carrying scientists. He was arrested but received diversion because this was a first offence. In February 2005, Oosterman received worldwide attention when he was arrested at the start of the Auckland World Naked Bike Ride for refusing to put on underwear. He was covered in thick blue body-paint at the time. In court he pleaded not guilty to the charge of indecent exposure. To protest this charge, he stripped off in front of the courthouse with three other activists wrapped in a banner reading \\"STOP indecent exposure to vehicle emissions\\". He then ran into the court naked, but put his clothes back on for the plea hearing. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence. On 22 March 2005, he and other protesters publicly complained about police brutality while passively resisting arrest for obstructing a footpath, following a peace demonstration that went inside an ANZ bank. In May 2006 he filed papers at the Auckland district court seeking NZ$50,000 in damages from the New Zealand police after being pepper sprayed at a January 2005 protest against an alleged genetic engineering experiment outside the Forest Research Institute in Rotorua. On 2 July 2008, Judge Chris McGuire awarded Oosterman $5,000 damages and $25,000 court costs, saying police actions had not been reasonable, but rejected Oosterman's claim of assault saying the officer's actions did not quite meet the necessary \\"high threshold of blameworthiness\\". In July 2007, Oosterman, who runs a web hosting service for community groups, was forced to remove a Save Happy Valley Coalition spoof annual report of Solid Energy's environmental record, which included a logo of the state-owned enterprise, due to infringement of their copyright and trademark. He was involved in a 2007 protest in support of Iranian hunger striker Ali Panah at Mount Eden Prison, during which he was arrested.

The school began in the former Clergy and Archbishop's House, which had housed St. Joseph's Boys' High School before it moved to its present location in Richmond Town. The school was named after a French priest Rev. Fr. Saint Germain. The school is managed by the Archdiocesan Board of Education, under the chairmanship of the Archbishop of Bangalore. The school is recognized by the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (ICSE) Delhi. History The school was founded in January 1944 by the then Archbishop of Bangalore, Rt. Rev. Thomas Pothacamury D.D., in memory of Rev. Fr. Saint Germain, a well beloved French priest, who till his retirement worked as a teacher and procurator at the local St. Joseph's School and College. These were housed in the present school building (main) till they were moved to their current location at Museum Road in Richmond Town. The school is situated on top of St. John's Hill with Coles Park on one side and St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral on the other. The main entrance to the school used to be on St. John's Church Road and provided direct entry to the playground. The gate was closed and the main entrance re-located in 1976 to Promenade Road so that the playground provided unfettered access for play and recreation. School motto St. Germain High School had a Latin motto, Ad Augusta, Per Angusta. During the tenure of Rev. Fr, Mervyn Coelho, the English translation was employed, Triumph Through Trials . School song Hark! Now we sing Of St Germain the school that we love For it is here that we learn to uphold the right Seeking light, seeking help from above Strive might and main Let the odds be what they will We shall conquer all, trials great or small Onwards mates! We must climb the Hill! Lo! On the heights Rays of glory illumine the skies, 'Tis the land where Truth and where virtue dwell Where the sunshine of honour abides. March! Falter not, Though the way be weary and long. All the toil and strife face we bravely now Firm in faith, bold of heart and strong. Management The school is managed by the Archdiocesan Board of Education. It is the only Anglo-Indian school maintained by the Board and is affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination, New Delhi. Till 1961 the students were prepared for the Bangalore European Secondary School Examination (Std XI) and the Cambridge Overseas Examination. From 1962 to 1969, the State Government conducted the Anglo-Indian secondary School Certificate (A.I.S.S.C.) Examination (Std XI). With the change over to the present 10+2+3 Course of States, the I.C.S.E. (Std X) is conducted at the end of Std X. From 1977 to 1990 the school also presented students to the local Std X (SSLC) Examination. The school always has over 90% passes in the Public Exam with 100% passes in many years, with the first rank occasionally. Extra-curricular activity includes sports and games, NCC and Scouts, debating and the school band. The school has represented Karnataka in the Nehru Hockey Tournament held at New Delhi and has won the B.T. Ramaiah Shield in cricket. The NCC Officer Fazal Bari Khan has been honoured at the State and National levels. The school's Scoutmaster, Mr. S.J.P. Keerty and Cub Master Mr. I.

Ziziphus celata is very nearly extinct. Description It is a small spiny shrub that is usually less than 2 meters tall. Clusters of highly fragrant tiny green flowers are borne in winter, and grape-sized, yellow-orange fruit develop in spring. Range The species is currently restricted to just eight sites which collectively support only a few genetically distinct individuals. The first known record of the plant was from a single, mysterious, dried herbarium specimen originally collected in 1948 near the city of Sebring in Highlands County, Florida, U.S. Because the precise location of the locality had not been recorded by Ray Garrett, of Avon Park, and because no living plants were known to exist in the wild, the species was presumed extinct. In 1984 the species was described and named posthumously by W.S. Judd & D.W. Hall of the University of Florida. Many botanists later searched for Ziziphus celata, but none were successful until 1987 when the species was rediscovered by Kris R. DeLaney, a Florida botanist also from Avon Park. DeLaney later discovered two additional populations, one consisting of only a single large plant, the other of several dozen scattered over, and persisting in, a large area of improved cattle pasture. Ziziphus celata is very nearly extinct. Of the eight known populations, four are in old pastures, three on degraded sites, and the most recent discovery is in its natural sandhill habitat, found in early April, 2007 by Brett Miley, a Florida ecologist, while photographing other endangered plants. Habitat Very little remains of central Florida's once vast upland ecosystems. Agribusiness and unplanned, sprawling commercial development in central and south Florida, along with inadequate conservation and regulatory programs, have decimated Florida's ecosystems and pushed hundreds of native plant and animals species to the brink of extinction. Florida's ecosystems and vegetative communities have been so completely disrupted, and so much genetic diversity lost, that many formerly widespread and common plants are considered to be \\"genetically\\" extinct, and incapable of adapting and surviving as part of a functioning ecosystem. Ziziphus celata is listed as an endangered species in the United States.

The entire length of Highway 312 is an expressway with a few grade crossings. The highway is a major transit route, bypassing the north side of Eau Claire by connecting Interstate 94 (I-94) with U.S. Route 53 (US 53). The route number is derived as a \\"spur route\\" of US 12. Wisconsin Highway 312 is called the North Crossing in the Chippewa Valley. Route description Highway 312 begins at an interchange with I-94 (exit 59) in the town of Union. It heads east for about 0.4 miles to an intersection with US 12\\\\. East of this junction, US 12 and Highway 312 overlap for past the Wild Ridge and Mill Run golf courses to the northwestern limits of the City of Eau Claire. The two routes split at a diamond interchange, with US 12 heading south on North Clairemont Avenue and Highway 312 continuing east as the North Crossing. Highway 312 travels another through the northern edge of Eau Claire, crossing over the Union Pacific, Altoona subdivision railroad tracks, before reaching the bridge over the Chippewa River. After crossing the river, Highway 312 passes under the Union Pacific, Chippewa Falls subdivision railroad tracks and comes to an interchange with North Hastings Way, a former alignment of US 53\\\\. About east of the North Hastings Way junction, Highway 312 comes to an end at an interchange with US 53 at exit 90 just outside Eau Claire in the town of Seymour. History The North Crossing highway, serving as an alternative to I-94 bypassing downtown Eau Claire, was opened to traffic in 1994. The name \\"North Crossing\\" developed during the planning stages of the project that culminated in the creation of the highwaythe highway was designed to divert traffic crossing the Chippewa River that, prior to its creation, had to pass either through downtown Eau Claire, via the Madison St. bridge, or just west of Chippewa Falls on U.S. 53. The distance between these two bridges is approximately . The \\"North Crossing\\" name specifically referred to a more northerly river crossing than any other point in Eau Claire. When it came time to decide upon a name for the highway, the term \\"North Crossing\\" had already become well established in the vocabulary of the area, and so it was decided that that was the most natural name for the new roadway. WisDOT extended Highway 124 from Chippewa Falls using an overlap with North Hastings Way (then U.S. 53) to the North Crossing highway and then west along the highway to I-94. In June 2005, the northern half of the Eau Claire Bypass (current U.S. 53 freeway) was completed and signed as Bypass U.S. 53. The North Crossing highway was extended about a mile east of North Hastings Way to meet the new freeway. This extension was also designated as part of Bypass U.S. 53. Highway 312 was first established by legislation in 2005 as a new route number for the stretch of then Highway 124 running from Interstate 94 to U.S. Highway 53. This resulted in the shortening of Highway 124 to a length and routing nearly identical to that it had in 1992 before it was extended to cover the then-new \\"North Crossing\\" in Eau Claire. While the legislation establishing Highway 312 was intended to only take effect once the new U.S. 53 bypass of Eau Claire was completed, local authorities \\"jumped the gun\\", posting new \\"WIS 312\\" signs as early as November 2005. The southern half of the bypass opened in August 2006 and the U.S. 53 designation was relocated from North Hastings Way to the new freeway. This resulted in the retiring of the Bypass U.S. 53 designation. North Hastings Way was also turned back to local control.WisDOT Press Release, August 26, 2005WisDOT - State Highway Route Changes (2005) Junction list References External links 312 Category:Transportation in Eau Claire County, Wisconsin ","title":"Wisconsin Highway 312"},{"id":"5072254","text":"Abdullah Abdulqadirakhun is an Uyghur refugee, who was held for more than seven years in Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba.

Along Willows Beach is Willows Park, where a tea- room is run by the Kiwanis Club in spring and summer. It takes its name from the Willows Fairground built in 1891Terry Reksten, More English than the English, Victoria: Orca Books, 1986, p. 117 and which remained Greater Victoria's main horse-racing venue during the early years of the twentieth century. The Willows Racetrack was situated nearly a kilometre (about a half a mile) inland from the beach, so named because of the willow trees that grew there. This was the site of the ancient Salish Sea seaport of Sitchanalth. Archaeological digs have identified a Coast Salish permanent encampment of several thousand people for generations. The centre of the community was at the mouth of Bowker Creek where currently the well known private school Glenlyon Norfolk School (GNS) is located. This is the site of what is hypothesized to be the main long-house of the village. The latest theory is that the whole seaport was destroyed by the Great Salish Sea (Seattle) tsunami of 930AD. Activities Willows Beach is a very actively used beach and park in Victoria. On summer days the public areas are usually packed with people. Various clubs and organizations often hold gatherings in Willows Park, including rallies, club meetings, poetry readings, barbecues and family gatherings. There are areas where the public can set up volleyball courts and often on the weekend the spaces are filled quickly. Willows Beach is also the location of the annual Oak Bay Tea Party, in which people from all over Victoria participate, enjoying the rides, shows, games, and the parade which runs all around Oak Bay. To the very north of the beach, is Uplands Park to the left (North) of Beach Drive and Cattle Point on the water side of the road (South). Cattle Point is the site of the Cattle Point Star Sanctuary (aka Cattle Point Dark Sky Star Park). This is also the site of the world's largest orrery, The Salish Sea Walk of the Planets. There are a quite a few trails in this area. Skimboarders frequent the beach in the spring and summer. The north and south ends are shallower, which are more ideal for skimboarding. The north end of the beach at Cattle Point is the start and end of the Salish Sea Walk of the Planets, and the local stretch, the Oak Bay Walk of the Planets.

As a writer, she is primarily known for her Alex quartet and long-term advocacy for New Zealand children's literature. As an editor she has also published a number of anthologies. Early life and family Duder was born Tessa Staveley in Auckland on 13 November 1940, the daughter of John Staveley, a doctor and pioneer of blood transfusion in New Zealand who was later knighted, and Elvira Staveley (n√©e Wycherley), a cellist. She was educated at the Diocesan School for Girls in Auckland, and went on to study at Auckland University College in 1958, later returned to the University of Auckland between 1982 and 1984. After leaving school, Staveley worked as a journalist for the Auckland Star from 1959 to 1964, before travelling to Europe and working for the Daily Express in London between 1964 and 1966. She married John Duder in 1964, and the couple went on to have four daughters. Following the birth of her first child, Duder was a full-time mother for seven years, much of it spent in Pakistan. She returned to Auckland in 1972, where she reentered the workforce as a pianist. Swimming As a teenager, Staveley competed in the butterfly and medley swimming events, becoming a national record holder in both events during 1958‚Äì59. She won the New Zealand national 110 yards butterfly title in 1957 and 1958, and the national individual medley championship in 1957, 1958, and 1959. At the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Staveley won the silver medal in the 110 yards butterfly, recording a time of 1:14.4 in the final. She was also a member of the New Zealand women's 4 x 110 yards medley relay team, alongside Philippa Gould, Kay Sawyers, and Jennifer Hunter, that finished in fourth place. Staveley was named New Zealand Swimmer of the Year in 1959. Writing Duder began writing fiction in 1977. Her first novel Night Race to Kawau was published by Oxford University Press in 1982. Her most successful works are the Alex quartet of novels (Alex, Alex in Winter, Alessandra: Alex in Rome and Songs for Alex) which build upon her own childhood experiences by following a teenage competitive swimmer with Olympic ambitions. The series won three New Zealand Children's Book of the Year awards and three Esther Glen medals. Alex has been translated into five languages and was for many years Penguin New Zealand's best selling work of fiction. A film production of Alex was released in 1993 but was commercially unsuccessful. Duder's later work has been varied, including plays, anthologies and biographies. The Tiggie Tompson Show won the 2000 New Zealand Post Senior Fiction Award for young adult fiction. Her first work for adults, a short story collection Is She Still Alive? reached number two on New Zealand bestseller lists in 2008. Duder has performed in several of her own plays and acted in 11 episodes of the New Zealand soap Shortland Street. Duder is a past president of the NZ Society of Authors (PEN NZ Inc). In 1990, she was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

It is the only member of the genus Yermo and was first described in 1991. Distribution The desert yellowhead is currently known to exist only two populations on less than of Bureau of Land Management land in southern Fremont County, Wyoming. One population contains an estimated 12,000 plants, the other about 400 plants. Description Yermo xanthocephalus is a perennial, herbaceous plant growing up to in height with alternate, leathery leaves. The leaves are lanceolate to obovate, up to in length and in width. The leaves produce a mild numbing sensation in the mouth when ingested. Numerous flowerheads (25‚Äì180) are crowded at the top of the stem. Each composite flower contains four to six yellow disk flowers and no ray flowers. It typically flowers from mid-June to August. Conservation The plant has been a federally listed threatened species in the United States since 2002. it is not included in the IUCN Red List. At the time of its listing, the desert yellowhead was threatened by human activities, including potential oil and gas field development on two leases that encompass the plant's habitat. The two populations were protected from surface disturbance activities related to oil and gas field development in 2005. The habitat is also in the vicinity of mineral resources such as opals, gold, uranium, and zeolites. As of 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service considered the threat from oil and gas development and mineral extraction to be \\"low in severity and magnitude and not an immediate threat to the species\\". Other potential threats include recreational off-road vehicle use in the area, and one of the populations has been closed to off-road vehicles. No illegal cross-country vehicular travel has been noted and the threat remains low. Non-native and invasive species such as Hyoscyamus niger (black henbane), Cardaria spp. (whitetops), and Centaurea repens (Russian knapweed) are in the vicinity and may post a threat to the populations in the future. The threat of oversampling for education and research as well as livestock and wild ungulate grazing and trampling were considered to be low in severity. Because of the desert yellowhead's small population and limited geographic range, even small-scale habitat degradation could make it vulnerable to extinction. However, recent surveys indicate that the desert yellowhead population appears stable and current conditions appear favorable to the species and its habitat.

Although he won a libel case against the Daily Star newspaper, which had alleged that he had sex with her, it was later established, in legal proceedings in 2001, that he had perjured himself in the trial. Archer was jailed for this in July 2001. Coghlan died in a car crash shortly before the second trial and Archer's subsequent conviction. Early life Monica Mary Coghlan was born on 3 April 1951, in Rochdale, the sixth of seven children. She had a troubled childhood, leaving home and school at the age of 15. While living alone, the diminutive (1.50 m, 4' 11\\", as an adult) teenager suffered a violent sexual attack and was forced to leave her flat. She first worked as a cloakroom attendant at a local cabaret, then became a prostitute at the age of 17. Her work alias was 'Debbie'. She was arrested several times for soliciting in the Greater Manchester area, and moved to London. Other arrests led to convictions for cannabis possession and shoplifting. She served two prison terms. All the time she concealed what she did from her family, telling them she worked in property.\\"Victim: Monica Coghlan\\", 20 July 2001, The Guardian\\"The Press, the Hooker, the Peer and His Fragrant Wife\\" , by Michael Yockel, New York Press, 16 April 2001 She became pregnant, and for a short time retired from prostitution, returning to live in Rochdale to raise her son, Robin Daley Coghlan (born 1984, Rochdale). When her boyfriend died unexpectedly, she returned to prostitution, leading a double life \\"to secure the boy's future\\"; she cared for the toddler during the week, then left him with friends or relatives at weekends, to commute by train to London to work. Jeffrey Archer In September 1986 Coghlan picked up a client in Shepherd Market, Mayfair. Aziz Kurtha, a Pakistani or IndianIndian who felled Archer squabbles for art businessman who saw him with Coghlan, identified him as Jeffrey Archer, then the Conservative Party's Deputy Chairman.Paul Robertshaw, Summary Justice, A&C; Black, 1998, pp.44.ff Kurtha sold the story of Archer seeing a prostitute to a tabloid newspaper. Rather than print the unverified story, the paper decided to organise a 'sting' by getting Coghlan to ask Archer for money to stay silent. On 24 October 1986, the News of the World filmed and audiotaped Michael Stacpoole, a representative of Jeffrey Archer, giving Coghlan ¬£2,000 in ¬£50 notes on Platform 3 of London's Victoria Station to leave the country to avoid reporters. Coghlan earned ¬£6,000 from the newspapers for taking part in the sting operation. Archer admitted to giving Coghlan travel funds, but sued the bolder Daily Star for printing that he and Coghlan had had sex for money. During the trial, Coghlan broke down in tears repeatedly on cross-examination, but continued to assert the truth of the newspaper's story, dramatically calling Archer a liar in court. In other testimony she stated that she enjoyed her job as a prostitute, and defended her work with married clients, saying that \\"Half the time it keeps marriages together.\\" She regretted that she could not go back to work after the trial. \\"Jeffrey Archer took everything away from me,\\" she would later say. \\"I lost my home, my dignity, my self-respect, and any hope of a future.\\" After the trial After the trial, Coghlan posed topless for a newspaper for ¬£5,400, then worked as a bingo caller, earning enough money to buy a small house, where she continued raising her son Robin, out of the limelight, who had no knowledge of his mother's former profession and notoriety until he was 15. Then, in late 1999 and 2000, as Archer was running for Mayor of London, several of his confederates who had testified at the trial for him, began recanting their stories. In September 2000, Archer was charged with perjury, his trial due to open the next May. However, on 26 April 2001, drug addict Gary Day crashed a stolen Jaguar S-Type into Coghlan's Ford Fiesta outside Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. Day, 32, had robbed a pharmacy for drugs, then hijacked two cars using a fake pistol: first a Peugeot taxi, which he crashed into a parked Land Rover, then the Jaguar from a motorist who had stopped at the first crash scene to help. Coghlan's car was catapulted through a wall. She lay in the wreck for an hour, and had to be cut out of the wreckage through the car roof. She died from her injuries the next day in a hospital in Leeds, aged 50.

State Road 45 in Brown County Route description From Bean Blossom and through Brown County, State Road 45 is a narrow, shoulderless two-lane road that passes between the Morgan-Monroe State Forest and the Yellowwood State Forest. It is heavily wooded and follows the natural terrain, which gives the road tight curves and steep hills. As the road passes into Monroe County, the woods disappear and farms and homes begin to line the road. The road remains hilly and curvy until it reaches Bloomington, where it bypasses the city concurrent with State Road 46 and then State Road 37 and Interstate 69. West of Bloomington, shoulders appear on State Road 45 and its two lanes become wider. The road meanders with the rolling terrain until it meets and overlaps State Road 58, after which it is straight and flat until its terminus at US 231. History Prior to the early 1980s, State Road 45 was multiplexed with U.S. 231 from Rockport to the State Road 58 junction near Scotland. However, as with State Road 43's former multiplex with 231 from Spencer to Lafayette, the state highway department deleted much of the route. This left the current segment along with a short, 5-mile section from Patronville to Rockport that acted as a connector to then-U.S. 231 (now State Road 161) and Owensboro, Kentucky. This southern section was decommissioned and turned over to the control of the city of Rockport (within the city limits) and Spencer County (outside of Rockport) in early 2001, about a year before U.S. 231 was rerouted onto the William H. Natcher Bridge. A major construction project to widen the road to four lanes in Bloomington was completed in November 2012.

He set twelve world records in his career. After his swimming career ended, he became the Pictorial Editor of the Sydney Morning Herald and later the head of ABC Sport. Biography Berry, the second of seven children, was born in Sydney and grew up in the western suburb of Marrickville, in a family with no prior sporting background. His father Frederick had arrived in Australia in the 1920s and had worked as a bar manager to support the family. He was taught to swim by his elder sister Colleen along with his younger siblings at Botany Bay. His younger brother Paul was a promising youth swimmer who defeated dual Olympic gold medallist Michael Wenden, and later became a professional rugby league footballer. Berry was educated at De La Salle College, and represented the school in athletics and rugby league, with moderate success. Berry joined the Pyrmont Club, which trained at Victoria Park Swimming Pool, under Eric Hayes, and swam from 1956 until 1958 as a freestyler, with reasonable age group success. In 1958 he won a butterfly race, and despite winning more races, Hayes did not think that he was suited to butterfly. Berry switched coaches to Don Talbot, training at Bankstown, New South Wales by the end of the year. In 1959, at the under-14 New South Wales Championships, Berry came first, second and third in the breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly respectively. Talbot encouraged him, predicting that he would do well the following year. Berry's parents were surprised when Talbot told them at the end of the year that Berry had a chance of making the 1960 Summer Olympics team for Rome, even though he had never entered an Australian Championship before. At the end of the year, he came second to Neville Hayes, a fellow Talbot swimmer, defeating Harry Turner, who had been expected to be Australia's second butterflier at the Olympics. At the New South Wales championships in January 1960, he came second to Hayes in both the 110-yard and 220-yard butterfly, and repeated this at the Australian Championships, earning himself Olympic selection at the age of 14. He was sent on a training camp with the Australian team to Townsville, Queensland to prepare for the Olympics. Arriving in Rome, Berry swam in the heats of the 4√ó100-metre medley relay, before being replaced by Hayes in the final, who combined with David Theile, Terry Gathercole and Geoff Shipton to claim silver behind the United States. Under the rules of the era, heat swimmers were not entitled to medals. In the 200-metre butterfly, Berry qualified fifth fastest, but came home in sixth in the final, six seconds behind the American winner Mike Troy. Hayes finished second. Troy, who was impressed by Berry, sent him an autographed postcard, implying that he could be the next Olympic champion. In 1961 Hayes again won the State and National titles, relegating Berry to second. Berry also finished his high schooling that year, and had a disrupted preparation for an international meet at the end of the year against a Japanese team and the 1962 Commonwealth Games the following year. In the four bilateral meets at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, Berry managed to beat Hayes in the last race, making a psychological breakthrough. At the following New South Wales Championships, he broke both the 220-yard and 110-yard butterfly world records, breaking Hayes' dominance. He again lowered the 220-yard record at the Australian Championships in qualifying for the Commonwealth Games. At the Games in Perth, he set Commonwealth records in both events to record his first international victories, and then combined with Julian Carroll, Ian O'Brien and David Dickson to add a third gold in the 4x110-yard medley relay. In 1963, Berry successfully defended both of his butterfly titles, and then made a European tour with the Australian team, and then passed the entry examinations to Indiana University, and moved to the United States on a swimming scholarship under Doc Counsilman. He was defeated in the US Championships that year by Carl Robie, who later captured his world records. Berry trained amongst high calibre swimmers at Indiana, as his teammates included Tom Stock, Chet Jastremski and Ted Stickles, holders of every backstroke, breaststroke and medley world record respectively. In 1964, Berry returned to Australia to qualify for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, breaking world records in both the 100-metre and 200-metre butterfly. Due to financial difficulties, he took a job as a petrol station attendant, and washing dishes for a steakhouse. In one case, the Australian team were hosted for a reception at the steakhouse meaning that he had to prepare and clean up despite being one of the guests. Berry attended a training camp in Ayr, Queensland under Talbot, who was the national head coach. During the week before the 200-metre event in Tokyo, Berry, the favourite for the gold medal, swam an extremely slow time trial during practice, in the view of opposition swimmers, leaving doubts in Talbot's mind. Robie broke the Olympic record in both the heat and semifinal. In the final, Berry was one of only two swimmers to have had previous Olympic experience and decided to deliberately false start in order to unsettle his opponents. He then set a time of 2:06.6, 0.3 of a second faster than his previous world record to claim gold. He later combined with Dickson, O'Brien and Peter Reynolds to claim bronze in the 4√ó100-metre medley relay. Berry returned to the United States, but was unable to match his previous form, and exchanged regular wins and defeats with Robie, who swam for the University of Michigan. He was selected for the 1966 Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica, but withdrew after his father's death and returned to Australia. He retired the following year and married, but continued his university education, initially studying business, but later switching to radio and television, and then photography. He worked as a photographer for two years in the United States before switching to the Sydney Morning Herald in Australia, where he later became the Pictorial Editor. He served as the ABC head of sport from 1985 until 1987, before starting his own private sports business.

Pre-modern commentaries  * According to the Aitareya Brahmana, the pancha-janah include: the gods; the humans; the Gandharvas and the Apsaras; the snakes; and the Fathers. * According to Yaska's Nirukta, Aupamanyava explains the Rigvedic term pancha-janah as the four varnas of the Indo-Aryan society and the Nishadas. The 14th century commentator Sayana also supports this explanation. * According to Yaska, the pancha-janah include the Gandharvas, the Fathers, the gods, the Asuras, and the Rakshasas. According to the 20th century Sanskrit scholars Arthur Anthony Macdonell and Arthur Berriedale Keith, none of these explanations can be regarded as adequate.  Modern scholars  * 19th century German Indologists Karl Friedrich Geldner and Rudolf von Roth, the term denotes \\"all the peoples of the earth\\", with Vedic Aryans in the middle, and other people in the four directions. Heinrich Zimmer, another German Indologist, has criticized this theory, arguing that inclusion of all of the earth's peoples in this expression is not in harmony with the frequent distinction made between the Aryans and the Dasas in the Vedic texts; that the term -janah is not used for the non-Aryans; that the deities Soma and Indra are mentioned as belonging among the pancha-janah; and that the pancha-janah are mentioned as located on the Sarasvati River. * According to Heinrich Zimmer, the term pancha-janah denotes the five Vedic tribes: Anus, Druhyus, Yadus, Turvashas, and Purus.

On 8 May 2006, the Court dismissed the charges, agreeing that the sexual act in question was consensual. During the trial, Zuma admitted to having unprotected sex with his accuser, whom he knew to be HIV positive, but claimed that he took a shower afterwards to cut the risk of contracting HIV. This statement has been condemned by the judge, health experts, AIDS activists and the public in general. Pre-trial events In November 2005, an investigation began into charges that he had raped a 31-year-old family friend at his home in Forest Town, Johannesburg. Even before charges were filed, the news media reported that the alleged victim was a member of a prominent ANC family and also an AIDS activist; and that Zuma had acknowledged a consensual sexual relationship with the woman in question.

Zuma had not entirely lost his support base. As Zuma's rape trial proceeded, reports surfaced that the South African Communist Party was severely divided over how to address the issue of Zuma and the SACP's relationship to him. Many members of the party's youth wing supported Zuma while others in the SACP were skeptical about the value of rallying behind a particular person as opposed to emphasizing principles of governance. Despite the defection of some former supporters, however Zuma stalwarts continued to rally outside the courthouse, arousing criticism by anti-rape groups for regular attacks on the integrity and moral standing of Zuma's accuser, insults yelled at a close friend of the accuser, and even stones thrown at a woman that members of the crowd mistook for the accuser. In an unprecedented allowance by a South African judge, Zuma's defense team was allowed to introduce evidence relating to the woman's sexual past, and asserted that the sex that took place was consensual. The prosecution asserted that her lack of resistance was due to a state of shock that is common in instances of trauma, and that the relationship between the two was like that of a 'father-daughter' pair. The trial also generated political controversy when Zuma, who headed the National AIDS Council, admitted that he had not used a condom when having sex with the woman who now accused him of rape, despite knowing that she was HIV-positive. He stated in court that he took a shower to try to reduce his risk of infection, upsetting HIV educators who emphasized that this would do nothing to prevent HIV transmission. Result On 8 May 2006, the court found Zuma not guilty of the charge of rape. On 3 July 2007, the woman who brought the rape charges against Zuma was granted asylum in The Netherlands.

It comprises three sections, Junior, Senior and Open, each of which is open to all pre-university students studying in Singapore who meet the age requirements for the particular section. The competition is held annually, and the first round of each section is usually held in late May or early June. The second round is usually held in late June or early July.  Junior Section  The Junior Section consists of 5 multiple-choice questions, each with five options, and 20 open-ended questions, geared towards Lower Secondary students. Topics tested include number theory, pattern recognition, geometry, simple combinatorics and algebra. Noticeably, trigonometry is not included as a test subject, because trigonometry is not included in the Lower Secondary mathematical curriculum. Beginning in 2006, a second round was added, based on the Senior Invitational Round, and consists of a 5-question, 3hour long essay/proof.  Senior Section  There are two rounds to the Senior Section: a written round (Round 1) and an invitational round (Round 2). The exam in Round 1 consists of 5 multiple- choice questions, each with five options, and 20 open-ended questions. The Senior Test is geared towards Upper Secondary students, and topics tested include number theory, combinatorics, geometry, algebra, probability. The second round, the Senior Invitational Round consists of a 5-question, 4-hour long paper, with each question of varying difficulty. Only the top scorers of Round 1 are invited to take this test, and helps determine the individual rankings of the test takers.  Open Section  Similar to the Senior Section, there are also two rounds, the written round (Round 1) and the invitational round (Round 2). The paper in Round 1 comprises 25 open-ended questions, and geared towards pre-university students. Topics tested include number theory, combinatorics, geometry, algebra, calculus (occasionally) , probability, but of a higher difficulty level than the Senior Section. The Open Invitational Round consists of a 5-question, 4.5-hour long paper, in which only the top scorers of Round 1 are invited to take. This test will help determine the individual rankings of the scorers, and in addition, it acts as a guideline to select Singaporean or Permanent Resident participants for the National Team training team, whereby a further six will then be selected for the International Mathematical Olympiad.  Prizes  As of 2006, in each of the Junior and Senior sections, prizes are awarded to the 30 individuals with the highest total scores in the first and special rounds, as well as to the 20 secondary schools with the highest team scores. The team score is computed by summing the three best scores from students of their school in the first round alone. In the Open section, prizes are similarly awarded to the top 30 individuals, as well as to the 10 institutions (secondary schools and junior colleges with the highest team scores from the first round. Effective 2012, however, school awards are also awarded based purely on the sum of the 3 highest scorers, including both the first and second round. The above prizes take the form of cash awards, certificates displaying the individual's/team's ranking, as well as trophies. Individuals who do not place in the top 30 may also receive gold, silver, bronze, honourable mentions or participation, in decreasing order of merit.

It is a small nocturnal macropod which lives in small groups. It has long hind feet and front feet with curved claws, which it uses to dig for food. Its body has large amounts of fur, which helps with insulation, and its fur ranges between brown and grey, the colour fading on its belly. This potoroo has a long, thin snout curving downward that it uses to smell its surroundings; this trait is common in all potoroo species. Its eyes appear to bulge out of its face and look as though they are on an angle, and its ears are almost invisible, buried under thick fur. Male and female body types are similar and are both within the same size range. Adult females range in weight from 708‚Äì1205 g (including pouch young where present), whereas adult males range in weight from 845‚Äì1200 g.\\"Biodiversity.\\" Potorous Gilbertii ‚Äî Gilbert's Potoroo. Australian Government, 16 July 2013. Web. 22 October 2013. The current estimated population is a sparse seventy individuals. It was thought to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1994. The only naturally located population is found in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve in Western Australia, where they co-exist with quokkas (Setonix brachyurus). Small populations are also being established at Bald Island and Michaelmas Island.  Taxonomy  Illustration by H. C. Richter, accompanying Gould's 1841 description. A description of the species was published by John Gould in his Monograph of Macropodidae (1841), which included an illustration of the species by H. C. Richter. The name was published in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, reporting Gould's presentation of the specimen at its meeting on 9 February 1841. Gould placed the new species with the genus Hypsiprymnus, and the taxon was later assigned to the genus Potorous. A specimen of the animal was collected by the field worker John Gilbert at King George Sound, while collecting birds and mammals for Gould at the new colonies in the southwest of Australia. The holotype is a female skin and skull placed at the British Museum of Natural History, a specimen that was also named as Hypsiprymnus micropus G. R. Waterhouse 1841. Gould's description was later submerged as a subspecies or recognised as a synonym of other potoroine taxa, and was referred to as Potorous tridactylus in taxonomic and conservation listings. Until the rediscovery of the species, the material available limited any comparison with its related taxa. An analysis of the new material and revision of the genus Potorous confirmed what Gilbert has supposed when he collected the first specimen, and the taxon was again recognised as a species. The specific epithet was nominated by Gould to recognise John Gilbert and suggested the trivial name of Gilbert's rat kangaroo. Gould also provides the name used at King George Sound, given as grul-gyte. A review of historical records for the names in the Nyungar language proposed the adoption of ngilkat [ngil'kat] as the regular spelling of its preferred common name.  Description  A small species of Potorous with a fur colour that is rufous brown across the upper side and light grey beneath. The length of the head and body combined is 270 to 290 millimetres, the average is 250 mm, and is proportionately less than the length of the tail, which is from 215 to 230 mm and averageS 223 millimetres. The measurement of the hind foot is 65 to 70 mm and proportionally less than the length of the head. Their short ears are covered in greyish fur and rounded in their profile, the fur is also grey over the muzzle. The recorded weight range of the species is 785 to 965 grams. The tail of Potorous gilbertii tapers away from the body and is covered with only a small amount of hair.  Distribution and habitat  Gilbert's potoroo was once found in a large distribution range across south-west Australia, but seems to have been locally restricted. Sites at Cape Naturaliste and Cape Leeuwin have produced sub-fossil remains that show the range extended to the west of the King George Sound region at some point in recent history. The physical and anecdotal ranges included the areas around King George Sound and near the Margaret River, but the native range became reduced to the Mount Gardner headland at Two Peoples Bay. Within that area of less than 1,000 hectares, the species occupies four separate areas of dense shrubland within valleys at the mount's slopes; Mount Gardner provides a habitat that has been isolated from changed fire regimes. These areas are described as a Melaleuca striata and Melaleuca uncinata shrubland, between 1.5 and 2.0 m tall with 70-100% canopy cover, and a dense layer of sedges including Lepidosperma sp. and Anarthria scabra as the understorey. The vegetation forming its habitat has not been burnt for over 50 years, so long, unburnt areas are thought to be necessary for the species. Foraging activity is nocturnal, remaining hidden in dense undergrowth during day, and rarely crosses large open areas.  Diet  Study of the species diet is limited to the relict population discovered at Two Peoples Bay, and is found to be similar to that of Potorous tridactylus. Gilbert's potoroo is primarily mycophagous, a diet that consists of multiple species of truffle-like fungi. It may also consume fleshy fruits as seeds have been found in the scat, but it is not known how important this is to its diet. Australia has the majority of fungal varieties and the Gilbert's potoroo eats a variety of them. From translocation of the potoroo, the species was found to survive on many different kinds of fungi, not limited to the species available in its habitat at Two People's Bay. As with many of the potoroine species, the primary type of fungus consumed is hypogeous, with the above ground fruiting bodies of epigeous fungi forming only a minor part of their diet. Plant matter consumed includes leaves and stems, and invertebrates have also been recorded in the excreta; this has been regarded as incidental ingestion while eating subterranean fungi. Ninety percent of the volume of material consumed is hypogeous fungus. The spores of five fungal species have been recorded in faecal matter throughout the year, the total number is around forty species. Gilbert's potoroo has sharp, three-toed claws that help it dig into the ground to unearth fungi. After digestion, the potoroo aids in spore distribution, as the spores germinate from its feces.  Reproduction  A female Gilbert's potoroo can have two babies in a year, while carrying only one at a time. It has the ability to keep a second embryo in a state of diapause while the first embryo is growing. If the first baby does not go to term, the second baby starts growing right away. The gestation period for this species is unknown, but is estimated to be similar to the long-nosed Potorous tridactylus at 38 days.Friend, Tony. \\"Gilbert's Potoroo.\\" Nature Australia 27.9 (Winter 2003): 22. 14 April 2009 Since so few are alive today, much of the reproductive cycle for Gilbert's potoroo remains unknown. However, the main breeding period is thought to be November‚ÄìDecember with similar breeding patterns to those of the long-nosed potoroo. Scientists have tried to breed them in captivity, but recent attempts have been unsuccessful, citing diet, incompatibility, and age as possible factors that influenced the lack of reproduction. Reproduction in the wild is thought to be progressing successfully as many females found in the wild are with young.  Rediscovery  Mammals of Australia (1863) After the collection of the first specimen in 1840, when Gilbert had reported to Gould that the species was locally common, the success of field workers in finding the animal was little and then none until the rediscovery in the late twentieth century. Gould's description gives a report by Gilbert that the local Nyungar people caught them in \\"immense numbers\\" on a single hunt. A letter of James Drummond notes a series of specimens assembled by his son, around a dozen from an unspecified location. Gerard Krefft also noted that George Masters, a highly active collector of the Albany district, obtained around five to eight specimens in 1866 and a pair in 1869. Later workers known to have made extensive collections in the area, including Shortridge and John Tunney, failed to record this species in the southern districts by the end of the nineteenth century. The few historical records of the species are all at the southern coast of Southwest Australia, summarised as those around King George Sound during 1843, 1866, 1869 and 1875, and the uncertain date of 1890s to the west. The species was presumed extinct for 20 years before it was rediscovered in 1994 in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve.\\"A Gap in Nature: Discovering the World's Extinct Animals.\\" Australian Artist 18.6 (Dec 2001): 2. April 2009 Liz Sinclair had been doing research on wallabies and caught the potoroo in one of her traps.\\"Potoroo's return\\" New Scientist 144.1956 (17 Dec. 1994): 12. 14 April 2009 She then compared her captured specimen with the skeletons of past potoroos and proved it was indeed a Gilbert's potoroo. No other wild population has been found after the rediscovery at Two Peoples Bay. The size of the population places the species on the edge of extinction, and the trajectory of the species is considered precarious.  Population  Potoroos were Australia's NO.1 most endangered mammal. After the rediscovery of Gilbert's potoroo, additional specimens were immediately taken into captivity to try to help to promote more young to be born to help increase the population. A few young were born in the first few years, but then breeding stopped due to age differences and a history of balanoposthitis, a disease that affects the male potoroo's penis and causes inflammation and ulceration if left untreated. This problem exists among the wild population; captive males are treated with antibiotics. In 2001, the Gilbert's Potoroo Action Group was formed\\"Bald Island home to two more Gilbert's potoroos\\". 16 Aug 2007. Retrieved on 2007-10-07. to help in the education and public awareness of the potoroo. The group also helps with raising funds for the research and captive-breeding programs for Gilbert's potoroo. In efforts to protect the remaining population, three Gilbert's potoroos (one male and two females) were moved to Bald Island in August 2005, where they are free from predation. Since that time, an additional four potoroos have been sent to establish a breeding colony. Along with the dwindling number of the species after their rediscovery in Australia, one of the potoroos was found to have some sort of sickness when brought into captivity in early 2000. The scientists who had brought the young male potoroo and its mother into captivity found that the animal had significant loss of appetite, and lost 32% of its body mass within a few weeks. They had observed it moving in circles in captivity and behaving in an odd manner. They had also noticed symptoms of sporadic coughing fits and before its death had seen that the potoroo had actually gone into a state of hypothermia. In a later study of a long-nosed potoroo, the same symptoms were found and were likened to a fatal disease, cryptococcosis, which had been contracted while the animals were in the wild. This could also be a factor why the potoroo population is dwindling in the wild, because the disease could be killing the young before they are able to reproduce. A thesis published in 2008 considered the diseases that may affect individual P. gilbertii and the remaining population. Some conditions detected in the hosts were associated with novel species of internal and external organism. In 2016, Michaelmas Island, off the coast of Two Peoples Bay, was chosen as a new habitat location. The island's lack of predators was a key factor in its selection, which will provide the Gilbert's potoroo with a similar level of long-term protection enjoyed by the quokkas of Rottnest Island, also in Western Australia.  History  Gilbert's potoroo was one of first species noticed as disappearing after British colonisation, and remarkable in its rediscovery at the end of the twentieth century. The relict population at Two Peoples Bay, around forty individuals, had survived the factors that caused the mass decline of Australian mammals in a critical weight range of species smaller and larger than themselves. The earliest records of the species are found in the letters and field notes of John Gilbert, repeated by Gould and later authors, as the only source of information on the living species. John Gould published the existing name in the Nyungar language as \\"Grul-gyte\\" (1841) and later \\"Ngil-gyte\\" (1863), the second name matching Gilbert's own field notes as the name reported to him at King George Sound. A similar name was given in various other ways in the early wordlists of Isaac Scott Nind (nailoit) and George Fletcher Moore (garlgyte) as and others, and rendered as 'ngilkat' in an ethnohistoric review published in 2001. The author proposed the species name Hypsiprymnus gilbertii with an explanation in A monograph of the Macropodidae, or family of kangaroos,  References  *  External links  * Gilbert's Potoroo at Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation * Gilbert's Potoroo (Potorous gilbertii) Recovery Plan * Gilbert's Potoroo Action Group Category:Critically endangered fauna of Australia Category:Potoroids Category:Mammals of Western Australia Category:Mammals described in 1841 ","title":"Gilbert's potoroo"},{"id":"5072561","text":"John David Hills (born 21 April 1978) is an English former footballer.

Davis ran four times for New York's 26th congressional district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives between 2004 and 2011, three times as a Democrat (twice as the general election candidate against incumbent Tom Reynolds and a third time in a three-way primary) and once as an independent. Davis's political campaigns are primarily motivated by his concern that the country is being destroyed by U.S. free trade policies, which he says have led to the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries and the decline of manufacturing in the United States. Noted for his party-switching, Davis has said that had he won the 2011 election, he would have caucused in the House with the Republican and Tea Party caucuses. A lifelong Republican, Davis switched to the Democrats after being kicked out of a fundraiser headlined by Dick Cheney in 2003 when he tried to ask Cheney questions about free trade policies. He then ran for the U.S. Congress seat in his home district, NY-26, in 2004, 2006 and 2008 as a self-funded candidate, pouring in millions of his own funds and coming close to beating the incumbent Republican Thomas Reynolds in 2006. In the 2008 election, however, he came in third out of three in the Democratic primary. He switched his affiliation back to Republican with the election of fellow wealthy industrialist Chris Lee, becoming an ally and supporter of Lee. After Lee's abrupt departure from Congress in February 2011, Davis tried and failed to get the Republican nomination to replace Lee and decided to run as an independent on a newly created Tea Party line. Davis is the owner of I Squared R Element Company, a silicon carbide heating elements company that he founded in 1964. He is also known for filing a successful lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission in 2006, claiming that the so-called \\"millionaire's amendment\\" to McCain- Feingold Act was unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court, with Justice Alito writing for the 5‚Äì4 majority, sided with Davis, striking down the millionaire's amendment as violating the First Amendment to the United States Constitution for fundamentally restricting the right of a self-financing candidate to spend his or her own money in a preferred way. Early years and education and business career Davis grew up in Western, New York and attended Amherst Central High School. In 1955, Davis graduated from the University of Buffalo with a bachelor's degree in engineering. Davis would later fund the construction of UB's Davis Hall, which was named after him. Following graduation, Davis served in the Marine Corps and in the U.S. Coast Guard as a lieutenant. He began work as an engineer in 1958, first at General Motors as a maintenance engineer, then at The Carborundum Company as a supervising sales engineer. In 1964, Davis started his silicon carbide heating element manufacturing business, I Squared R Element, out of his garage and now employs 75 people in Akron, New York. He has touted the fact that he has never outsourced any jobs. According to 2011 financial disclosure statements, Davis' net worth is between $18.2 million and $83.4 million (about half that of his opponent Jane Corwin). Party affiliations Davis was a self-described \\"Goldwater Republican\\" for 50 years. In late 2003, he attended a Republican fundraiser in Buffalo, featuring Vice President Dick Cheney. Davis insisted on talking to Cheney about U.S. free trade policies, which Cheney's staff refused to allow, ordering Davis to be ejected from the fundraiser. Davis then quit the Republican party. He later became a Democrat (2003), then founded the Save Jobs Party (2004‚Äì05), then rejoined the Republican Party (2008), and in March 2011 created the Tea Party ballot line by obtaining the required number of signatures. Political career In 2004 and 2006 Davis ran as a Democrat in the general elections facing no primary challengers. He lost both times to incumbent Republican Tom Reynolds, described by the New York Times as one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress. In the 2008 race, Davis finished third place in a three-way Democratic primary to Alice Kryzan. In the ongoing 2011 election, Davis, who has been a registered Republican since 2008, is now s running on the \\"Tea Party\\" line. He has said he is running again because of his concern that the country is being destroyed. A major theme of Davis' campaigns is that too many U.S. manufacturing jobs have been outsourced to foreign countries, with 53,000 manufacturing plants closed in the past 30 years and 17 million Americans presently unemployed. He believes U.S. free trade policies and agreements have caused the job loss and the great recession. He says the free trade policies have been pushed by multinational corporations and big box stores such as Walmart who effectively have purchased the White House and the U.S. Congress. Davis says he is free of those influences, and wants to go to Washington to save American jobs, farms and industries. =2004 Congressional campaign= In 2004, Davis officially entered politics, running as a Democrat for the U.S. Congress from the 26th District of New York against incumbent Republican Representative Tom Reynolds, who was considered unbeatable. Davis doubled his original financial commitment to the race, pouring a total of $1.2 million of personal money into his campaign. Reynolds was forced to begin running campaign ads for the first time since his election in 1998. On election day, Reynolds won, 56 percent to 44 percent; in contrast, he won the 2002 election 75 percent to 25 percent against the Democratic challenger. Many cite the amount spent by Davis as compared to Reynolds' prior challenger as the primary factor for the change. Some observers attributed the narrowed margin of victory to an undercurrent of resentment in the working-class areas of the 26th district over economic decline and a lack of manufacturing sector jobs. Others attributed the margin to the politics of the specific candidates; Reynolds' politics more closely resembling big-government neo-conservatism while Davis' more closely resembles the limited-government libertarian conservatism of Goldwater, the type of conservative thought more widely adhered to in Upstate New York. After the election, Davis was fined for a violation of campaign finance reporting laws. Davis had used his non-profit \\"Save Jobs\\" organization to funnel money into his political efforts, failing to comply with political disclosure requirements of both the federal government and New York State. =Save Jobs Party= Following his defeat in 2004, Davis continued his political activism by forming the Save Jobs Party to further his goals of repealing free-trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). Davis believed that free-trade allowed low-wage nations, such as China to compete unfairly with American- produced manufactured goods and agricultural crops. Davis believed that this would be a popular idea in his native Upstate New York, which contained many struggling farms and factories. Although Republicans accused him of using the party merely as a springboard for a 2006 rematch against Reynolds, Davis sponsored more than a dozen candidates for public office in races across Western New York. However, the Save Jobs party soon ran into trouble with state and federal officials. In one incident, an Erie County legislator sought an FBI investigation over last-minute automated phone calls (robocalls] that had been made from Davis's campaign headquarters. In early 2006, Davis' state PAC was sued in State Supreme Court for improper filing of financial disclosures. Davis abandoned the fledgling party. =2006 Congressional campaign= Davis ran against Reynolds as the candidate of the Democratic, Working Families and Independence Parties in 2006. Davis received the Democratic nomination since no other Democrat chose to run in the September 12, 2006 primary. He appeared on three ballot lines and votes from all three nominating parties counted towards Davis' total under New York's electoral fusion rule. As in 2004, Reynolds won, but by a much narrower margin. With the Mark Foley scandal in full swing, pundits re-evaluated the odds of Davis winning against Reynolds. It was widely reported that Reynolds had knowledge of earlier e-mails between Foley and a page, although he was unaware of more explicit instant messages reported by ABC News. Davis led Reynolds in several polls taken during October 2006, but an early November poll showed him trailing 46 to 50. He lost by a \\"hair's breadth\\", according to The Washington Post. =2008 Congressional campaign= After Reynolds announced his retirement from Congress in 2008, Davis ran a third time for the seat. He began as the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic Party nomination but he faced stiff competition from Iraq War veteran and teacher Jon Powers. Democrats viewed Powers as their strongest candidate, and blamed Davis' attack ads for taking him out in the primary. Powers finished second, Davis third, with little-known environmental attorney Alice Kryzan winning the primary. She lost the general election to Republican Christopher J. Lee 55‚Äì40 percent. =Davis v. Federal Election Commission= Davis filed a successful lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission between his 2006 and 2008 runs for office, claiming that the so-called \\"millionaires amendment\\" to the McCain- Feingold Act election reform law was unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court, with Justice Alito writing for the 5‚Äì4 majority, struck down parts of the act as violating the First Amendment for fundamentally restricting the right of a self-financing candidate to spend his or her own money in a preferred way. =2011 Congressional campaign= Davis changed his political affiliation from Democratic back to Republican in 2010, after developing a favorable working relationship with Chris Lee over the course of Lee's time in office. He expressed interest in the special election to replace Lee, who resigned in February 2011. Davis met with the Republican chairs regarding a possible run, but according to Davis, the meeting \\"didn't go great\\". The Party was dissatisfied with his brief time in the Democratic Party and his willingness to run on a third-party line if he didn't get the Republican nomination, according to the Lockport Union-Sun & Journal. A GOP county chair told The Buffalo News that Davis had disqualified himself by expressing views that were contrary to typical Republican positions. The Republican nomination went to Jane Corwin. Davis also had discussions with Erie County Conservative Party chairman Ralph Lorigo regarding a potential run on that line, but after Corwin received Republican nomination, the other two parties put her on their ballot lines. Finally, Davis briefly, but unsuccessfully courted the Democrats for their nomination, then decided to run on a newly created independent line, under the name \\"Tea,\\" sending out paid campaign workers to collect the 3,500 required signatures for a ballot listing (Davis's campaign workers collected over 12,000 signatures in total). He received the endorsement of the Tea Party Coalition of New York, but his Republican opponent Corwin got the endorsements of TEA New York and the Tea Party Express. Davis has said that if elected, he will caucus with the Republicans and Tea Party caucus because his opinions and positions align more closely with those groups than with the Democrats. The Tea Party Coalition is an organization run by Libertarian Party activists James Ostrowski and Allen Coniglio, who use the name \\"Tea Party\\" for the ballot line on which they run their independent candidates; Ostrowski and Coniglio previously had used the line for David DiPietro in a state senate race and Janice Volk in a congressional special election in another district prior to Davis using the line. Political positions Davis' ideology is \\"too inconsistent to be readily categorized\\", according to the Washington Post. When asked about the issue of illegal immigration during his interview for the Republican endorsement in 2011, Davis reportedly shocked local Republican leaders by suggesting that illegal immigrants could be deported and unemployed black youth bussed from the cities to pick the crops. Davis' spokesperson said the comments could be viewed as politically and racially incorrect; \\"but when you have African American people in Buffalo who do not have jobs and are out of work, why are you bringing people into this country illegally to take jobs?\\" he asked. Davis' main issue is his opposition to free-trade policies and agreements which he believes have allowed low-wage nations, such as the People's Republic of China, to compete unfairly with American-produced manufactured goods and agricultural crops. Davis been described as favoring gun rights, and has said that his position on the Second Amendment rights is similar to that of other members of the Tea Party movement. He has given inconsistent answers on the issue of abortion rights. Davis opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and also opposed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Campaign The special election was initially thought to be a \\"certain victory\\" for the Republican candidate, but became \\"fiercely competitive\\", according to The New York Times, because of a U.S. House Republican plan to privatize Medicare. The Times also cited the third party candidacy of Davis as a factor which is \\"siphoning support\\" from Corwin. A late April poll by Sienna College had Corwin in the lead with 36 percent, followed by Hochul with 31 percent and Davis with 23 percent of the vote. An early May poll by the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Institute showed Hochul at 35 percent, Corwin at 31 percent and Davis at 24 percent. An unusual number of voters had a negative opinion of each candidate, according to the pollster: Hochul, 42 percent for Corwin and 43 percent for Davis. National media attention was given to a 15-second video clip that appeared to show Corwin's Assembly chief of staff, Michael Mallia, repeatedly asking Davis why he had skipped a campaign debate, followed by Mallia yelping as Davis apparently shoved him or flapped at the camera. The video clip was circulated by local and national Republican organizations and prompted bipartisan criticism of both Davis and Mallia. Requests to see a longer tape and a tape made by second camera were refused by Corwin and her campaign. In response to Davis' complaints that he had been harassed, Corwin said, \\"I've had cameras on me for two months now, and I've never hit anybody ... and I think that's the difference is how you handle a situation like that.\\" The Tea Party Express and TEA New York which endorsed Corwin traveled to Rochester and Buffalo to hold events where they criticized Davis' use of the Tea Party name. After the election, TEA New York blamed Davis for Hochul's win. Roll Call reported that Davis had promised to spend as much as $3 million of his own funds and that Corwin had invested nearly $2.5 million of her own funds in the campaign as of May 13. Roll Call also said that outside funds coming from both liberal and conservative groups had \\"turned the Buffalo and Rochester airwaves into a steady stream of campaign ads.\\" Davis, in contrast to his opponents, received no assistance from outside funds.

(Carl Fredrik) Edmund Neupert (1 April 184222 June 1888) was a Norwegian music teacher, pianist and composer. Among Neupert's compositions, the 24 Concert-Et√ºden and the 24 Octav-Et√ºden are especially highly regarded. Biography Neupert was born in Christiana (now Oslo), Norway. He was the son of Herman Wilhelm Neupert (1806‚Äì78) and Caroline Friederike Wiedmayer (1814-1878). His father was a musician and piano teacher. Bomberger, E. Douglas, (1999) Brainard's Biographies of American Musicians, Greenwood, , pp.203-205 He studied in Berlin at the Neue Akademie der Tonkunst under Theodor Kullak (1818‚Äì1882). He also received instruction from Friedrich Kiel (1821‚Äì1885). In 1866 he was hired as piano teacher at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin operated by Julius Stern (1820‚Äì1883). Neupert was a teacher at the Stern Conservatory from 1866-1868. He then moved to Copenhagen, where he held a position at the city's conservatory for two years. In 1881 he traveled to Moscow, and in 1882 he moved to Christiania, where he taught at a piano school for children. From 1883 he stayed in New York City. He was now best remembered as the soloist at the world premiere of Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor. This occurred on 3 April 1869 in the Casino Concert Hall in Copenhagen, with the Royal Danish Orchestra conducted by Holger Simon Paulli. The piano used for the performance was lent for the occasion by Anton Rubinstein, who attended the concert. Grieg himself was not present, due to commitments back home in Norway.Grieg and the Danish connection Neupert was also the dedicatee of the second edition of the concerto (Rikard Nordraak was the original dedicatee), and was said to have actually composed the cadenza in the first movement.James Huneker, Steeplejack, Part III, New York 1877-1917 Family In 1870, Neupert was married to Hilda Bergh (1848‚Äì1934) and the couple had one son Robert Isidor Neuper (1871-1894).

The capital was Rabat.African Cities - Driving the NEPAD Initiative, UN-HABITAT Administrative divisions The region is made up into the following provinces and prefectures : * Prefecture of Rabat (now part of the Rabat-Sal√©-K√©nitra Region) * Prefecture of Sal√© (now part of the Rabat-Sal√©-K√©nitra Region) * Prefecture of Skhirat-T√©mara (now part of the Rabat-Sal√©-K√©nitra Region) * Khemisset Province (now part of the Rabat-Sal√©- K√©nitra Region) History Most of the population of this region has historically been concentrated in coastal areas. The first recorded history is centered at Chellah, an early Phoenician settlement at the edge of Rabat along the southern bank of the Oued Bou Regreg. Later the Romans took control and enlarged Chellah, whose ruins are today a prominent archaeological point of interest. Chellah was a significant ancient port city town with remains including the Decumanus Maximus, a forum, a monumental fountain, a triumphal arch, and other ruins.C.

Following on from the calamitous Prussian defeat at Kunersdorf in August however, this small victory for Frederick the Great, taken together with the one fashioned at Korbitz four days earlier by Friedrich August von Finck, no doubt proved a timely tonic to his fragile confidence. Preliminaries In September 1759 various armies under Prussia's Frederick the Great and Prince Henry, Austria's Count Leopold Joseph von Daun, and Russia's Pyotr Saltykov were shadowing each other across Silesia. Through successive, rapid crossings of the Oder Frederick succeeded in denying the cities of Glogau (now G≈Çog√≥w) and Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw) to the Russian forces but he failed to gain the decisive terrain advantage he sought before offering battle. Meanwhile, Daun was looking to press home the great victory won at Kunersdorf when news reached him of the embarrassing defeat of the Austrian forces in Saxony, by a Prussian army but one third their size. Now more determined than ever to strike a decisive blow he marched his forces to G√∂rlitz and climbed to high ground in order to observe the camp of Prince Henry of Prussia, his nearest, convenient opponent. Daun proclaimed his intention to storm this camp early the following morning, September 23. The march of fifty hours Unfortunately for von Daun, at that moment Prince Henry was already making plans to leave the area. Throughout the evening of Saturday September 22 the Prussian forces quit their tents and marched away silently, leaving only watch fires and a token force to make plenty of noise. They made first for Rothenburg (Upper Lusatia) and rested there for three hours as twenty miles to the south, the Austrians sprang forward and overran their empty positions. Von Daun's scouting horse reported that the Prussian baggage was now heading northeast towards Glogau. He suspected a trap and retired to Bautzen but in fact, when Prince Henry left Rothenburg it was to head due west, eighteen miles, to the Saxon village of Klitten. A further three hours rest was then followed by a forced march of twenty miles to the area of Hoyerswerda where lay an unsuspecting Imperial force of 3000 men under General Wehla. General Wehla had distinguished himself at the Siege of Dresden. His subsequent deployment at Hoyerswerda was as part of a line designed to prevent the Prussian forces in Saxony and Silesia combining together. Recent events suggested that such an occurrence was unlikely however, since Frederick the Great was tied up in a minuet with the Russians whilst Prince Henry of Prussia now appeared on his way to join his brother in the east. Indeed, von Daun had written to Wehla just a few days previously, informing him that there was no danger on his eastern flank. Out of the woods It must therefore, have been something of a shock when the Prussian vanguard under the Swiss General Lentulus, came streaming out of the woods. Wehla rallied his Croat regiment and formed his artillery but a well aimed Prussian cannonade swept through his Corps. Within a matter of minutes the Austrians were in full flight with their General captured and six hundred dead on the field. His hopes destroyed, von Daun was now forced to head west into Saxony himself, in order to shore up his forces there, leaving his Russian allies to face Frederick alone. Thomas Carlyle in History Of Friedrich II Of Prussia (1858) called the Prussian night march probably Prince Henri's cleverest feat‚Ä¶By this last consummate little operation he has astonished Daun as much as anybody ever did; shorn his elaborate tissue of cunctations into ruin and collapse at one stroke; and in effect, as turns out, wrecked his campaign for this Year.

The mission of AFIC is to provide service to the community in a manner that is in accordance with the teachings of Islam and within the framework of Australian law, and to advocate for the Sunni Muslim community on matters that will affect the community's relevance, settlement and integration within Australian society. It is highly debatable whether AFIC represents Australian Muslims, as AFIC run organisations are very few, and their members are not elected by a majority Muslim vote. It is reported that AFIC \\"sits on\\"' $65 million in assets. Membership The main role of AFIC is to represent Sunni Islam and Muslims of Australia as one \\"Ummah\\" to the government and other bodies nationally and internationally. AFIC coordinates and provides resources for activities of its State Islamic Councils and member Sunni Islamic societies. The definition of Muslim according to AFIC member organisation, the Islamic Council of Western Australia, is \\"any person who conforms to the teachings of the Qur'an and Ahli Sunnah and Jamma' and shall specifically exclude any person or organisation, professing adherence to the Ahmadi, Lahori, Qadiani or Bah√° º√≠ schools of thought or of any similar inclination.\\"Constitution of The Islamic Council of Western Australia Incorporated, ICWA website.

The member organisations of AFIC are: * the Islamic Council of Victoria, * the Islamic Council of Queensland, * the Islamic Council Western Australia, * the Islamic Council of South Australia, * the Islamic Council of ACT, * the Tasmanian Muslim Association, *The United Muslims of New South Wales (President: T Elcheikh) ‚Äì and * the Islamic Council of Northern Territory. Leadership In July 2016, Keysar Trad was elected President of the AFIC following the standing down of the previous president, Hafez Kassem. However it was reported in February 2017 that following a bid to take-over AFIC, which involved the changing of locks and the passing of no-confidence motions against the current executive, Trad has not been able to enter his office. In March 2017, it was reported the NSW Supreme Court had reinstalled the AFIC executive members, with Trad returned as president. Mohammed El- Mouelhy, head of the Halal Certification Authority (a competitor of AFIC), was installed as treasurer. Professor Shahjahan Khan, former Vice-President of the Islamic Council of Queensland, has said that to save AFIC from \\"self- destruction\\", the younger generation of Muslims need to work to rebuild the organisation. In May 2017, it was reported that Dr Rateb Jneid was elected president of the AFIC. Advocacy In 2005 Ameer Ali, president of the AFIC, said that governments should, \\"rid the community of radical elements\\" and also prevent radical speakers coming to Australia.http://www.theage.com.au/news/sushi-das/between-two- worlds/2005/07/27/1122143904716.html Between two worlds In 2011 the AFIC advocated that Australian Muslims be able to marry, divorce and conduct financial transactions under the principles of sharia law, claiming that Australian Muslims should enjoy \\"legal pluralism\\". In 2014 the AFIC has advocated for increased government funding for faith-based schools, as well as funding to establish services such as new halal and kosher food stores, as a means of helping Muslim Australians to settle in new areas. In August 2016, the President of the AFIC said students in AFIC schools are taught they should not practise sex until they are married ‚Äì and it should not be with someone of the same sex as this is clearly spelt out in the Koran and the hadith.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/education/islamic- school-alfaisal-college-has-neverhad-a-child-who-was-gay/news- story/a79078065cc974276c9c0f8a50144e19 The Australian (paid subscription) Halal certification The AFIC is one of Australia's top four halal accreditation certifiers with AFIC having strict rules with regards to Islamic slaughter for animals and for chickens. It is speculated that AFIC earns up to $1 million a year from this halal certification. In February 2017 it was reported that a group of former AFIC members had staged a coup, have opened a new bank account and are collecting and spending halal certification fees. Fees reported to be worth millions of dollars. Schools In 2015 AFIC controlled six schools. They are: the Malek Fahd Islamic School, NSW; the Islamic College of Melbourne, Vic; the Islamic College of Brisbane, Qld ; the Islamic College of South Australia, SA; the Langford Islamic College, WA and the Islamic School of Canberra, ACT. In 2010 the AFIC received $5.2 million from an Islamic School which is largely government funded. In 2012 the NSW government demanded the repayment of $9 million passed on to the AFIC. In 2012 a government audit discovered a number of irregularities relating to financial transfers between AFIC and its schools in Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra and Adelaide. Issues identified included the transfer of large sums of money, the lack of appropriate documentation and rental-payment concerns. AFIC's president Ikebal Patel and assistant-treasurer Ashraf Ali were both stood down. The schools received $42 million in government funding in 2013, plus $21.5 million for new buildings and other capital works, during the previous four years. Each of the schools has management and accounting-integrity issues. In 2015, it was reported that there has been a long-running dispute between the Islamic College of Brisbane and the AFIC, which owns the land, has resulted in members of the school board and principal being dismissed or resigning. The college has been asked to show-cause that it, \\"complies with registration and accreditation requirements\\".http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/islamic-college- of-brisbane-investigated-over-phantom-debt-secret-payments/story- fnihsrf2-1227283681092 Islamic College of Brisbane investigated over ‚Äòphantom debt‚Äô, secret payments In May 2015 AFIC schools were described as being in the midst of leadership crisis along with allegations of fraud. In 2015, the Malek Fahd Islamic School refused to repay the Department of Education. Six schools associated with the AFIC are to be audited, including the Malek Fahd Islamic School the Islamic College of Brisbane, the Islamic College of Melbourne, the Islamic College of South Australia, the Islamic School of Canberra and Langford Islamic College in Western Australia. Claims have also been made relating to financial impropriety, gender discrimination and teachers with fundamentalist principles. In November 2015 the Malek Fahd Islamic School sought an injunction in the NSW Supreme Court to remove the governance of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils. In mid November 2015 following a federal government audit, with the department concluding AFIC operates the schools for its own profit. Six AFIC affiliated schools were issued with non- compliance notices. Ultimately this could lead to the schools losing their government funding and in December 2015 government funding for the Islamic College of South Australia, was frozen. In February 2016 the federal government said it will revoke its $20 million funding to the Malek Fahd Islamic School. It was reported that the \\"feud\\" between the school board and the AFIC had escalated to the point where security was required at the school for \\"fear it could escalate into violence\\". In February 2016 it was reported that separate inquiries into AFIC's Malek Fahd Islamic School and Islamic College of Brisbane had uncovered serious irregularities. The Islamic School of Canberra will cease operating, following Federal and Territory Governments withdrawing support because the school had not been able to demonstrate that the $1 million in recurrent funding, was only being spent on education. In March 2016 both the Malek Fahd Islamic School, and the Islamic School of Canberra cut their ties with the AFIC and with other Australian Islamic schools registering new constitutions and declaring independence from the AFIC. In February 2017 the federal Minister for Education and Training, Simon Birmingham said the Islamic College of South Australia had failed meet obligations relating to governance, to financial management and to regular reporting. He said federal funding for the school will cease in April 2017. In March 2017 it was reported that, following a police request, in relation to the more than $1 million potentially missing and the high rentals paid to AFIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission have been undertaking financial investigations. A financial advisory firm is also carrying-out a separate forensic examination of the Islamic College of South Australia. In March 2017 AFIC listed 7 Australian schools as AFIC schools. Controversies In the late 1980s, AFIC received more than $100,000 in funding per year from Gaddafi's Libyan regime. AFIC's then-leader, Sheikh Taj El-Din Hilaly, had ties to Libya. In 2003 the AFIC and the Supreme Islamic Council of Halal Meat in Australia were involved in a 'poisonous battle' to control the millions of dollars in halal meat trade rights, granted by the Saudi King. In 2013 the AFIC vice-president was suspended from his position, and AFIC's bank froze its funds. In 2014 the founding president of the AFIC identified internal dysfunction and corruption as the cause of a long running feud within the organisation, which he says has disenfranchised Islamic councils around the country. In 2015 it was reported that a power struggle had developed within AFIC with competing demands by those advocating conservatism and those advocating liberalism. Dr Jamal Rifi believes AFIC, as Australia's peak Muslim body, is \\"not capable of providing the leadership its communities need\\". Other senior members of the Muslim community have voiced similar concerns. In December 2015 the AFIC president resigned after being accused of inappropriately using $100,000 of AFIC funds for legal expenses and for \\"rampantly spending\\" on unapproved overseas trips. AFIC's treasurer also resigned following this unauthorised spending. In March 2016 AFIC dropped legal proceedings, which had lasted several years, against former president Ikebal Patel. In November 2016, after the Australian Charities and Not-For- Profits Commission revoked the charity status of an AFIC subsidiary, it said it was concerned that AFIC, \\"may not have been operating as a not-for-profit entity\\". In February 2017 Trad and his supporters sued nine others over control of the AFIC. Supreme Court Justice Robert McDougall said it was \\"absolutely appalling\\" that AFIC was preoccupied with \\"internal squabbling\\". Trad and his supporters won the case. In February 2017, in response to a question regarding the meaning of Quran Chapter 4, Surah 34, the president of the AFIC said a husband can beat his wife, but only as \\"a last resort\\".

The estate houses the erstwhile Secretary's Lodge which is now a heritage hotel run by the erstwhile Maharaja of Kapurthala.  History  Chapslee is one of the oldest estates in Shimla having been built between 1828 and 1835. It was built by Doctor Blake, a surgeon in the service of the British East India Company. Lord Auckland, Governor General of the East India Company Territories, was a resident of the adjoining Auckland House. Finding the accommodation insufficient, he took this property first on rent and later purchased it in 1836, to house his private & Military Secretaries, ‚ÄòAides De Camps‚Äô (ADC‚Äôs) and named it ‚ÄòSecretary‚Äôs Lodge‚Äô. The Estate now has a school on it, and the home is run as an exclusive, heritage home by the owner Kanwar Ratanjit Singh and his family. He is the grandson of Raja Charanjit Singh of Kapurthala.  First Anglo-Afghan War  In June 1838, a tripartite treaty between the Government of India, Ranjit Singh and Shah Shuja was signed for the latter's restoration. Following this, Lord Auckland issued the Simla Manifesto announcing the intention of the Government of India to restore Shah Shuja to the throne of Afghanistan. The ‚ÄòSimlah Manifesto‚Äô, declaring the first war with Afghanistan, was issued from ‚ÄòSecretary‚Äôs Lodge‚Äô on 1 October 1838. Lord Ellenborough, who succeeded Lord Auckland as Governor General acknowledged the failure of Lord Auckland‚Äôs policy in Afghanistan. On 1 October 1842, precisely four years after the issue of the Simla Manifesto, the Government proclaimed its altered intentions. Lord Hardinge, who succeeded Lord Ellenborough as Governor General, continued to use Secretary‚Äôs Lodge as the Government Secretariat. General Peter Innes of the Bengal Army purchased Secretary‚Äôs Lodge in 1848 and changed its name to Chapslee. General Innes sold the house in 1870 and, thereafter, it changed hands every few years and served as the residence of famous persons, including Colonel William Gordon (around 1877), Sir Courtenay Ilbert, General Pemberton, General Sir C.

He converted it to his summer residence and refurnished the interiors. Raja Charanjit Singh died in 1970. Kanwar Ratanjit Singh, the grandson of the Late Raja Charanjit Singh of Kapurthala, is the present owner.

George reads the business section of the newspaper, where he learns that a stock that a friend of a friend of his‚ÄîSimon's friend Wilkinson‚Äîhad tipped him off to had gone up. George invests $5000 in the stock and persuades Jerry to invest $2,500. Jerry persuades his girlfriend Vanessa (Lynn Clark) to go away with him to a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont. He reads the newspaper in hope that his stock has gone up, but it has in fact fallen in value. The next day, Kramer (Michael Richards) tells Jerry that his stock has fallen again. Jerry calls George to get advice from Wilkinson, but no one can find him. George rings him back and tells Jerry that Wilkinson is in the hospital. Jerry wants to sell his stock, but George insists that the tip is good. George says he will go and visit Wilkinson to find out what they should do, despite the fact that George does not know him personally. At Jerry's apartment, Elaine says that the only way that she can get rid of Robert's cats is if they should have some form of \\"accident\\" and offers Jerry the job, but he refuses. Wilkinson throws George out of the hospital as soon as he mentions Simon, indicating the two had a falling out. Jerry sells his shares, while George decides to \\"go down with the ship\\". Jerry takes Vanessa to Vermont, but rainy weather keeps them stuck inside the bed- and-breakfast. He regrets going with her because they have nothing to talk about. Jerry reads the business section of the newspaper to see that the stock has risen dramatically since he sold it. Vanessa then claims that Jerry only took her to Vermont because he lost so much money. Back in New York, George celebrates selling his stock after he had netted a profit of $8,000. Elaine says that she gave Robert an ultimatum, and he chose the cats. George tells Jerry and Elaine that Wilkinson has another stock tip involving some sort of \\"robot butcher.\\" Production \\"The Stock Tip\\" was recorded in front of a live studio audience at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, California on March 12, 1990. This episode contains the first Seinfeld reference to Superman, which would be a recurring feature in later episodes in the series. An earlier draft of the episode featured Jerry arguing that in a nuclear holocaust, when everyone is very depressed, Superman could cheer everyone up with his \\"super humor\\". George responded by saying that no one would laugh because they would blame Superman for not stopping the holocaust in the first place. The character of Vanessa first appeared earlier in season one in the episode \\"The Stake Out\\". She is one of only a few of Jerry's girlfriends to appear in more than one episode. According to Larry David, co-writer of the episode, her character returned because there was no mention of any break-up in \\"The Stake Out\\", and therefore the characters were still dating. Benjamin Lum, who plays the grocery store worker, reappears as a mail carrier in the season five episode \\"The Cigar Store Indian\\". Reception When \\"The Stock Tip\\" was first broadcast on June 21, 1990, it attracted a Nielsen rating of 13.5/24, meaning that 13.5% of American households watched the episode, and that 24% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. The second season of Seinfeld was commissioned after this episode and a repeat of the pilot episode was broadcast. Critics praised several elements of the episode, including Jerry's confrontation with the dry cleaner. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said that the episode \\"succeeded in a few ways. For one, it includes DVD One's [The first disc of the 'Seinfeld Seasons 1 & 2' DVD boxset] funniest bit: Jerry's confrontation with a dry cleaner. In addition, the episode offers our first look at a program that tries to branch out substantially beyond just one story. The prior shows went with one overriding plot, but \\"Tip\\" indulges equally in the stock and Vanessa elements. It's still not a great show, but it provides some advancement.\\" David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B‚àí. He praised the acting, if not the writing: \\"Kramer's non-specific glee and Jerry's passive frustration at it are both different tones for the characters, and it's fun to see the show play with the archetypes they've already set up. Later on, after Jerry has cashed out with a loss but George hangs on to make a profit, George's incongruous happiness (replete with cigar, suit, and him daintily picking up the check) is equally amusing. But script-wise, it's again apparent that David and Seinfeld are pretty new to the concept of actually sketching out coherent plots... The whole thing kinda just moves along until it isn't moving along anymore. It's not unfunny, and there's some choice dialog, like Jerry and George having the first of many Superman conversations about whether he has super-humor powers.\\" Steve Schrider wrote, \\"While neither the strongest nor the second-strongest show of the first season, The Stock Tip proves that the show has come a long way, even after only five episodes. With this first season, the show's main issue is that it didn't equally utilize all four of its main characters... Jerry and Larry are the first to admit that they went into Seinfeld with little to no writing experience, but they were always very good about recognizing weaknesses and addressing them as needed.\\" References  External links   Category:Seinfeld (season 1) episodes Category:1990 American television episodes ","title":"The Stock Tip"},{"id":"5072792","text":"\\"The Ex-Girlfriend\\" is the first episode of the sitcom Seinfelds second season and the show's sixth episode overall. The episode first broadcast on NBC in the United States on January 23, 1991, after being postponed for one week due to the start of the First Gulf War. Co-written by the series' co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, the episode was inspired by one of David's personal experiences. Directed by Tom Cherones, \\"The Ex-Girlfriend\\" was the first episode of the show filmed at CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles, California (and would stay there for the remainder of the show's run), the previous season having been filmed at Desilu Cahuenga in Hollywood. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 10.9/17 and was positively received by critics. Plot George wants to break up with his girlfriend Marlene, whose tendency to drag out conversations and phone messages irritates him to no end. After an emotional split, he realizes he has left some books in her apartment. Jerry tries to convince George that he does not need the books, as he has already read them, but George nevertheless persuades Jerry to get them for him. To retrieve the books, Jerry decides to go on a date with Marlene, during which she tells him that she and Jerry can still be friends, despite her recent break-up. Jerry and Marlene start dating, but after a while, Jerry finds her just as annoying as George did. He wants to break up with her, but finds she has a \\"psycho-sexual\\" hold on him. Jerry is hesitant to tell George he is dating Marlene, but Elaine eventually convinces him that he should. After being informed, George tells Jerry he has no problem with him dating Marlene. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come to his apartment, but she breaks up with him. When Jerry asks why, she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny, and she could not date someone if she did not respect what they did. Cultural references The episode contains a number of pop culture references. Elaine mentions that a man she knows used to nod at her whenever she saw him, but suddenly stopped, leading her to state, \\" he went from nods to nothing.\\" This prompts George to hum the Tony Bennett song \\"Rags to Riches,\\" replacing the chorus with \\"nods to nothing.\\" During a discussion with Elaine, Jerry mentions the 1958 film The Blob. Jerry also mentions the novel Moby Dick, jokingly stating that \\"when you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends.\\" After George receives a bill from his chiropractor, he states \\"75 bucks? What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?\\" Production 211x211px The episode was written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and directed by Tom Cherones. David based the story on a personal experience of his, when he gave a ride home to a woman who had recently dated a friend of his. He would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: \\"Most of the stories are from [David's] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show.\\" David Sims of The A.V. Club commented, \\"Seinfeld started its second season, its first real season after a four- episode test run, very strongly with \\"The Ex-Girlfriend\\", and it is the first time we really see George as the character we know and love, that weird dark shadow of Larry David's mind who behaves as no functioning human being honestly could.\\" Among the actresses who auditioned for the part of Marlene were Amy Yasbeck; Jeri Ryan, who would go on to star in Star Trek: Voyager; and Heidi Swedberg. Swedberg was later cast as Susan Ross for Seinfelds fourth season. Tracy Kolis, who at the time was known for her appearance in the soap opera All My Children, was eventually cast for the part. She reappeared later in the season six episode \\"The Soup\\", in which she portrayed a waitress named Kelly. Norman Brenner, who worked as Michael Richards' stand-in on the show for all nine seasons, appears as an extra during the second scene, walking by twice in different clothing. The first table read of the episode took place on October 17, 1990. It was filmed in front of a studio audience six days later, on October 23. Seinfeld's stand-up performances were filmed on October 29, 1990, along with the performances used in \\"The Pony Remark\\" and \\"The Busboy.\\" Filming of the episode took place on stage 19 of the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles. \\"The Ex-Girlfriend\\" was the first episode to be filmed there, as the majority of season one was filmed in a studio called Desilu Cahuenga, in Hollywood, where The Dick Van Dyke Show had also been filmed. Tom Azzari designed the sets for the second season of the show, and was able to re-use various sets from the first season, thanks to Castle Rock Entertainment's decision to store them in a large storage facility. The chiropractor's waiting room, in which George believes he was charged too much for a visit, was the only new set which appeared in the episode. alt=The exterior of a restaurant at the corner of a street. Through the windows a waiter can be seen taking orders. Above the windows is the word \\"Restaurant\\" in big pink letters. Although the scenes in Monk's Cafe were filmed at the CBS Studio Center, the exterior of Tom's Restaurant, a diner at Broadway and 112th Street in Manhattan was used as the exterior for the cafe. The second scene of the episode, which takes place on a street, was filmed on CBS Studio Center's \\"New York Street\\", a set that consists of four very small store fronts. During seasons one to five, \\"New York Street\\" was the only set the writers could use to replicate New York City. This scene, and additional scenes which take place in Jerry's car, were filmed on October 22 from 5:00 to 8:30 p.m. One or two members of the crew shook the car to give the impression that it was moving, though it never actually was. Other crew members would move lights around the set to simulate street lights or headlights of other cars. Behind the car, two lights on a wheeled stand were placed to give the impression that there was a car behind it. This technique is called \\"poor man's process\\", because it is cheaper than other ways of achieving the effect. The show had previously experimented with this technique in the season one episode \\"The Stake Out\\". Some scenes in the episode were cut prior to broadcast. The opening scene in Jerry's car, in which George discusses breaking up with Marlene, originally had George proposing that he would stage his own kidnapping while walking down the street with Marlene, then hide out until she had given up on him. Although it was cut before the episode's broadcast, this scene was included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. Another scene which was cut featured Jerry's neighbor Kramer entering Jerry's apartment carrying a plate with cantaloupe on toothpicks. Originally, the scene in which Jerry tells George that he is dating Marlene took place in a library, with a librarian repeatedly shushing George and Jerry and kicking them out of the library at the end of the scene. The location was changed to Monk's Cafe because the dialogue had nothing to do with a library. Reception \\"The Ex-Girlfriend\\" was first broadcast on NBC on January 23, 1991, after being postponed for one week due to the start of the First Gulf War. The episode gained a Nielsen rating of 10.9 and an audience share of 17, meaning that 10.9% of American households watched the episode and 17% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. Although Seinfeld would be considered a hit show by today's standards, NBC was disappointed with its ratings, and, after three weeks, put the show on a two- month break. Critics reacted positively to the episode. Joseph P. Kahn, a critic for the Wilmington Morning Star, called the episode's writing and acting \\"anything but hackneyed\\" and stated, \\"One safe prediction, Seinfeld will be here for a good long run this time around (referring to how its first season only had five episodes).\\" Joyce Millman of Salon.com stated that she disliked Seinfelds pilot episode, but after seeing a scene from \\"The Ex- Girlfriend\\" in which Jerry and Kramer discuss returning fruit, she was \\"awed by Seinfeld and co-creator/writer Larry David's brilliant grasp of, A) working-class Jewish craziness, and, B) the absurd humor of the deeply mundane.\\" In a review of the episode, Jon Burlingame of The Spokesman-Review stated, \\"Seinfeld is an offbeat take on the standard sitcom concept. While rarely hilarious, it's often smart and amusing.\\" In his review of the episode, Chicago Tribune critic Rick Kogan stated, \\"Hip without posing, it delivers its comedy in sharp and spectacular style\\". Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling of Entertainment Weekly called \\"The Ex-Girlfriend\\" \\"The series' most multifaceted (if not most engaging) narrative so far\\", and graded it with a B. David Sims gave the episode an A, writing, \\"George is really the most revolutionary character: he's often repulsive and pathetic, but here these are traits we heartily enjoy and sympathize with and want more of... The best thing about this episode is that Jerry almost immediately getting with George's ex-girlfriend creates no drama in the group, though it would on almost any other sitcom.\\" A relatively negative review came from Chicago Sun- Times critic Lon Grahnke, who criticized Seinfeld's part in the episode: \\"this comedy series must ride on the shoulders of its star. And Seinfeld spends too much time shrugging\\". He also noted Dreyfus was not granted screentime, as opposed to Richards, whose acting performances he described as \\"get[ting] tiresome\\". Overall, Grahnke commented \\"At his best, Seinfeld draws a chuckle or two from his middle-brow remarks on modern life and its perplexing contradictions. At his worst, the comedian shows the smugness of a detached star who can mechanically control the level of laughter that greets whatever quip he may utter.\\" References External links * Episode script  * \\"The Ex-Girlfriend\\" on Sony Pictures Category:1991 American television episodes Category:Seinfeld (season 2) episodes ","title":"The Ex-Girlfriend"},{"id":"5072796","text":"\\"The Pony Remark\\" is the second episode of the second season of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld, and the seventh episode overall. The episode was written by series co-creators Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, based on a remark David once made. In this episode, Jerry, at a relative's 50th-anniversary dinner, makes a remark about hating anybody who had a pony when they were a child. His remark upsets the female guest-of-honor, causing her to storm out in anger. When the woman dies shortly after the dinner, Jerry and his friends wonder if the pony remark had something to do with her death. The episode featured the first appearance of Jerry's uncle Leo (Len Lesser), who became a recurring character on the show. The episode also featured the first appearance of Barney Martin as Morty Seinfeld, replacing actor Phil Bruns, who had portrayed Morty in the season 1 episode \\"The Stake Out.\\" \\"The Pony Remark\\" aired on January 30, 1991, and gained a Nielsen rating of 10.7/16. It gained positive responses from critics, and The New York Times considers the episode to have been a turning point for the show. Plot Jerry's parents, Helen and Morty Seinfeld, are staying at his apartment in New York City. Helen pressures him into coming along to the 50th-anniversary dinner of Helen's second cousin Manya (Rozsika Halmos) and her husband, Isaac (David Fresco). Jerry does not know Manya or Isaac, so he brings Elaine along as a social buffer. During the dinner, Jerry offhandedly states that he hates people who had a pony when they were growing up. This offends Manya, as she grew up in a village in Poland where she, and indeed most of the children, had their own ponies. Jerry tries to amend his remark, but Manya gets even angrier and leaves the table in a huff. After she leaves, Jerry tries to defend himself to the others but they don't accept his excuses. The following day, Jerry receives a phone call from Uncle Leo, who informs him that Manya has died, and the funeral will be held on the same day of his softball team's championship game. At Monk's Caf√©, Jerry, Elaine, and George ponder whether his comment was a factor in Manya's death. Feeling guilty, Jerry misses his softball game and goes to the funeral, where he apologizes to Isaac for his remark; Isaac assures him that Manya had forgotten all about it. Isaac decides to move to Phoenix in the wake of Manya's death, and Elaine asks what is going to happen with their apartment. Isaac eventually tells her that Jerry's cousin Jeffrey is taking it, much to her dismay. It starts to rain, and Jerry realizes the game will be postponed. The following day, the team loses the championship due to some exceptionally bad playing from Jerry, leading Elaine to speculate that Manya's spirit put a hex on him as revenge for the pony remark. Jerry bets Kramer he will back out of a resolution to rebuild his apartment so that it has multiple flat, wooden levels instead of needing furniture. Kramer eventually decides not build levels but refuses to pay Jerry, arguing that the bet is invalid because he did not attempt the renovation. Production This episode was written by series creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and directed by Tom Cherones. This episode was based on a remark David once made during a conversation. Cherones deliberately made Elaine sit at a smaller table while directing the dinner scene. \\"The Pony Remark\\" was the first episode in which Kramer wants to gamble; it is later established that he has a gambling addiction. The idea of Elaine asking Isaac what is going to happen with his old apartment was added during rehearsals. The first table reading of the episode was held on October 24, 1990, and a run-through was held two days later. \\"The Pony Remark\\" was filmed in front of a live audience on October 30, 1990, while Seinfeld's stand-up routine was filmed one day earlier, along with the performances used in \\"The Ex-Girlfriend\\" and \\"The Busboy\\"; Seinfeld changed wardrobe between takes. \\"The Pony Remark\\" featured the second appearance of Helen and Morty Seinfeld, who had previously appeared in the season 1 episode \\"The Stake Out\\". In \\"The Stake Out,\\" Morty was portrayed by Phil Bruns; however, David and Seinfeld decided they wanted the character to be harsher and re-cast him with Barney Martin, who auditioned for the part on October 15, 1990, at 12:45 PM. Martin was unaware that another actor had already established the part. Helen was portrayed by Liz Sheridan; in an early draft of the episode, her name was Adele, though this did not match her name from \\"The Stake Out.\\" It was later changed back to Helen. The episode also introduced Jerry's uncle Leo, portrayed by Len Lesser, who was known for his acting in gangster films, as well as The Outlaw Josey Wales and Kelly's Heroes. When Lesser auditioned for the part on October 22, 1990, he got a lot of laughs from David, Seinfeld and casting director Marc Herschfield, but did not understand why, because he did not think his lines were funny. Herschfield stated that Lesser was the right actor for the part when Lesser had auditioned. David Fresco guest starred in the episode as Isaac. Fresco had some difficulty with his lines in the episode, and would sometimes burst into laughter during filming. Other actors who guest-starred in the episode were Rozsika Halmos, who portrayed Manya, and Milt Oberman, who played the funeral director. Reception \\"The Pony Remark\\" was first broadcast on American television on January 30, 1991. It gained a Nielsen rating of 10.7 and an audience share of 16. This means that 10.7% of American households watched the episode, and that 16% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. The episode gained two Primetime Emmy Award nominations; Seinfeld and David were nominated for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series and Cherones was nominated for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series. Though the episode did not win either of its Emmy nominations, Seinfeld was praised for co-hosting the Emmy telecast. Dave Kehr of The New York Times felt that \\"The Pony Remark\\" was a turning point for the show, stating that, after the first few episodes, the show \\"turn[ed] into something sharp and distinctive Here, suddenly, is the tight knot of guilt and denial, of hypersensitivity and sarcastic contempt that Seinfeld would explore for the next eight years.\\" Holly Ordway of DVD Talk considered the episode the best episode of Seinfelds second season. \\"The Pony Remark\\" is considered one of Seinfelds \\"classic episodes\\". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, critics Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling called the episode \\"Seinfeld at its mordant best\\" and graded it with an A-. In the book Something Ain't Kosher Here: The Rise of the \\"Jewish\\" Sitcom, Vincent Brook analyzed the episode, saying, \\"Jerry is made to feel guilty for his 'lethal' pony remark, whence the episode's macabre humor; yet the moral in terms of ethno-spatial identity is clear. In its violent rejection of Manya, Seinfeld has driven descent-based ethnicities (and their legacy of privation and self-sacrifice) off the face of the earth, and literally off the air. There is no place for traditional Jewishness in the hedonistic Seinfeld world, \\"The Pony Remark\\" vociferously proclaims.\\" David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, calling it a \\"classic\\" and writing that it \\"is so damn clever in how it bonds Jerry's fears about social niceties with larger fears about mortality;\\" he also praised Louis-Dreyfus's acting, saying that Elaine \\"has an amusingly stark little bit of dialogue about death midway through the episode: 'You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that!' I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone.\\" He also admired \\"the estimable Barney Martin in his first appearance as Jerry's irascible dad.\\" References  External links   Category:1991 American television episodes Category:Seinfeld (season 2) episodes Category:Television episodes about funerals ","title":"The Pony Remark"},{"id":"5072802","text":"\\"The Phone Message\\" is the ninth episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld, and the fourth of the show's second season. The episode concerns protagonist Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry Seinfeld) dating a woman who likes a commercial for cotton Dockers he dislikes. Meanwhile, his friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander) leaves an obnoxious message on the answering machine of his girlfriend, and goes to great lengths to prevent her from hearing it. Written by series co- creators Seinfeld and Larry David and directed by Tom Cherones, the episode was produced to replace a script by staff writer Larry Charles. Charles had written an episode called \\"The Bet,\\" revolving around Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) buying a handgun. The script's gun content was deemed too provocative and, in little time, Seinfeld and David wrote \\"The Phone Message\\" to fill the production void. Though the episode was met with positive critical responses, its initial broadcast on February 13, 1991, was watched by an underwhelming audience of 13 million viewers, causing NBC to put the show on a two-month hiatus. Plot George is excited when he learns that he and Jerry are having dates on the same night. Both of their dates go well up to the point that they have to say goodnight. George's date Carol (Tory Polone) asks George to come up to her place for some coffee, but George tells her that he can't drink coffee at night because it \\"keeps [him] up.\\" Once she leaves his car, he realizes he made a mistake as \\"coffee\\" is a euphemism for sex. Jerry's date Donna (Gretchen German) remarks that she likes a cotton Dockers commercial that Jerry absolutely hates, and with that ends his interest in her. George decides to call Carol, but gets her answering machine. He leaves her an extremely long, obnoxious message and is concerned that she will think he is an idiot. Jerry's friend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) tells George that something similar happened to her brother-in-law, who took care of the problem by secretly switching the tape. Jerry advises George to wait a few days for Carol to call back; George agrees, but continues to leave increasingly angry ‚Äî and eventually almost hostile ‚Äî messages on her machine. When he discovers she was out of town, he decides to go through with the plan of changing the tape. Frustrated by his inability to use an answering machine, George convinces Jerry to go with him. They decide to wait for Carol outside her apartment, and George will distract her while Jerry changes the tape. They succeed, but, just as they are about to leave Carol's apartment, she tells George that she had already heard the messages and found them funny, adding that she \\"loves jokes like that.\\" Production =\\"The Bet\\"= Staff writer Larry Charles had written a script for an episode titled \\"The Bet.\\" In the episode, which was also known as \\"The Gun,\\" Elaine would bet against Jerry on the ease of buying a handgun to protect herself. The episode's subplot revolved around Jerry's neighbor Kramer returning from a vacation in Puerto Rico, claiming he had sex with a stewardess on his flight home. George and Jerry would remain skeptical and make a bet with him; eventually, George, Jerry and Elaine would go to the airport to check if Kramer was telling the truth. In writing \\"The Bet,\\" Charles had attempted to make a \\"funny, dark- themed\\" episode. Sets for the episode were built. Bobbi Jo Lathan was cast as flight attendant Lucy Merrit and Ernie Sabella was cast as gun salesman Mo Korn, who was described in the script as \\"overweight, greasy, slow and low- key.\\"194x194px However, during the read-through of the episode, it was negatively received by cast and crew members; both Alexander and director Tom Cherones felt the episode's gun content was too provocative. When she read a scene that referenced the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and William McKinley, Louis-Dreyfus turned to Alexander and stated, \\"I'm not gonna do this.\\" Though they did not want to, the cast started rehearsing. After 20 minutes they convinced Cherones to talk to Charles. On his way to Charles' office, Cherones bumped into NBC executive Glenn Padnick, with whom he talked to Charles, eventually agreeing not to film the episode. Commenting on the episode, Charles stated \\"You know, it would have been an interesting show, but we couldn't solve the funny problem of it. It never seemed to quite be as funny as it should be and, because of that, the balance was off and the darkness kind of enveloped it, and it could never really emerge from that darkness and become what it should have been. So, it was disappointing but also understandable.\\" Both Lathan and Sabella were given roles in later episodes; Lathan appeared as Patti in the season three episode \\"The Stranded,\\" while Sabella was cast as the \\"greasy naked guy\\" in \\"The Subway,\\" also for the show's third season. =\\"The Phone Message\\"= Series co-creator Larry David co-wrote the episode with Seinfeld in two days, as they had little time to write the script due to the cancellation of \\"The Bet.\\" George's storyline was largely based on David's personal experiences of leaving phone messages to women that would cause the end of a relationship. David had previously written a sketch for Saturday Night Live regarding a man who went into his girlfriend's house to erase her answering machine. The sketch was never produced, allowing David to use its storyline for the Seinfeld episode. Jerry's storyline was based on Seinfeld's own predicaments, as he extremely disliked the cotton Dockers commercial discussed in the episode. A few changes were made to the first few drafts of the script. Additional dialogue between George and Jerry regarding dates during the 1850s was removed for timing purposes. During his date with Donna, Jerry would mention his remark about ponies in the earlier episode \\"The Pony Remark,\\" but this was later changed to a remark about leaving a note when committing suicide. Initially, Kramer's first name was revealed in the episode; though the information was removed from the eventual script, the idea of revealing Kramer's first name would be further exploited in the season six episode \\"The Switch.\\" Gretchen German was cast as Jerry's date Donna. Gina Hecht, who would go on to portray George's psychiatrist Dana Foley during the show's fourth season, also auditioned for the part. Tory Polone, who portrayed George's date Carol, had previously appeared in the 1989 television films When We Were Young and Sparks. The episode was first read by the cast on Friday, December 14, 1990. Table reads usually took place on Wednesdays, but the read-through of \\"The Bet\\" had been held on December 12. Directed by Cherones, as were all other episodes of the second season, \\"The Phone Message\\" was filmed in front of a live audience on December 19, 1990. Jerry's stand-up routine had been filmed one day earlier. Reception The episode was first broadcast in the United States on February 13, 1991, on NBC. \\"The Phone Message\\" received a Nielsen rating of 9.7 and an audience share of 15, indicating that 9.7% of American households watched the episode, and that 15% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. Nielsen Media Research also estimated that approximately 13 million American viewers watched the episode, making it the 59th most-watched show of the week it was broadcast in. Disappointed with the ratings, as earlier episodes had averaged between 19 and 22 million viewers each, the network put the show on a two-month hiatus. When the series returned in its original timeslot behind Cheers, its high ratings and increasing popularity led NBC to order the full season. \\"The Phone Message\\" gained positive responses from critics. Jerry's dumping Donna because she likes the commercial has been frequently cited as an example of how the show's central characters would often break up with people for \\"fantastically insignificant reasons.\\" In a 1998 article, the staff of South Carolina newspaper The State cited \\"The Phone Message\\" as \\"the first episode that made an impression on [them],\\" referring to Seinfeld as \\"the comedic version of Hill Street Blues.\\" Entertainment Weekly critics Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling graded the episode with a B+, calling it \\"the first of two consecutive and classic George angst-fests, as Jason Alexander‚Äîmaster of frantic venom‚Äîbegins to make the character his own.\\" References External links  Category:Seinfeld (season 2) episodes Category:1991 American television episodes ","title":"The Phone Message"},{"id":"5072804","text":"\\"The Apartment\\" is the fifth episode of the second season of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld and the show's tenth episode overall.

Meanwhile, Jerry's friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander) wears a wedding ring to a party to see what effect it will have on women. The episode was written by Peter Mehlman and directed by Tom Cherones. Series co-creators Seinfeld and Larry David asked Mehlman to write an episode for the show after they read a few articles he wrote for newspapers and magazines. Mehlman originally had the idea of Elaine moving away from Jerry, but David and Seinfeld felt it would be funnier if Elaine moved closer to Jerry instead. \\"The Apartment\\" was first broadcast in the United States on April 4, 1991, on NBC (and was the first new episode of the series after the underwhelming reception of the previous episode, \\"The Phone Message\\" caused it to go on a two-month hiatus), and was watched in 15.7 million homes, making it the ninth most-watched program of the week it was broadcast. The episode gained mostly positive responses from critics. Plot While Elaine is depressed about the low quality of her apartment, Jerry overhears Harold (Glenn Shadix) and Manny (Tony Plana), the managers of his apartment building, discussing a death that makes an apartment available. Shocked by the low rent, Jerry tells Elaine that he will be able to get her the apartment above his. She is extremely excited to hear this, as she will be able to live near Jerry. Jerry belatedly realizes how intrusive Elaine might become and discusses his problem with George. They also talk about how women seem attracted to men wearing wedding rings. George borrows one from Kramer to test this hypothesis at a party. Harold and Manny inform Jerry that someone else has offered $5,000 for the apartment, so they will give it to him unless Elaine matches his bid. Jerry sees this as a perfect escape, since Elaine cannot afford the higher rent. Kramer walks in on Jerry breaking the news to Elaine. Oblivious to Jerry's real feelings, he pressures him to lend Elaine the rent money. After she leaves, Jerry rebukes Kramer for his faux pas. Later, Elaine, Jerry and George go a party where Elaine asks Jerry if it would be uncomfortable for them to live so close to each other; Jerry says he's not worried about it but soon feels stupid for not telling her the truth. George's wedding ring plan backfires, as women who are otherwise attracted to him are unwilling to pursue a married man. To make up for his earlier mistake, Kramer finds somebody who is willing to pay $10,000 for the apartment, a sum so large Elaine would not be willing to borrow it from Jerry. However, the new renter is a musician who constantly plays loud music, and Jerry ends up regretting not letting Elaine rent the apartment. Production \\"The Apartment\\" was written by Peter Mehlman and directed by Tom Cherones. Seinfeld and co-creator Larry David contacted Mehlman and asked him to write an episode for the show after reading a few articles Mehlman had written for The New York Times and Esquire. Mehlman noted that prior to Seinfeld he had \\"barely written any dialogue in [his] life.\\" He first conceived the idea of an episode in which Elaine would move away from Manhattan and Jerry had to confront his feelings about her. He discussed the idea with Seinfeld, David and staff writer Larry Charles, who felt that it would be funnier if Elaine moved closer to Jerry instead. After their meeting, Mehlman was told to write the episode, which surprised him, describing it as \\"unlike any other show, where they would have given beat for beat for beat.\\" As Mehlman was writing the script, he came up with the idea of George wearing a wedding ring to a party to see how women would react. Though the wedding ring idea was not included in the approved script, Seinfeld and David decided to keep it as it suited George well. The first table read of the episode was held on January 9, 1991. The episode was filmed in front of a live audience on January 15, 1991. Filming of the episode took place at the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where, starting with the season two premiere \\"The Ex-Girlfriend,\\" filming of all the show's episodes took place. A few scenes were changed prior to the filming of the episode. The scene in which Jerry informs George he told Elaine about the apartment initially showed them standing in line for the movies, talking about sitting in the front of the theatre. George would tell Jerry that he once pretended to have a grotesque physical impairment while he was standing in line to get a ticket for The Exorcist, and people would let him go in front of them without saying anything. The location of this scene, however, was changed to Monk's Cafe, a regular hangout for the show's main characters, and George and Jerry's dialogue was shortened. In the original script, Jerry, instead of George, proclaimed himself \\"lord of the idiots,\\" but this was changed during rehearsals. \\"The Apartment\\" featured the only appearance of Harold and Manny, the two building superintendents. Veteran actors Glenn Shadix and Tony Plana portrayed Harold and Manny, respectively. Their parts in the episode was originally smaller, but they were written into the final scene. Harold was set to return in the season two episode \\"The Revenge,\\" in which he would tell the show's central characters that Jerry's suicidal neighbor Newman jumped from the building, but an awning broke his fall. However, the Newman subplot in the episode was significantly reduced during production and Harold's part was cut. Theresa Randle, Patricia Ayame Thomson and Leslie Neale guest starred as women George unsuccessfully flirts with while wearing a wedding ring. Louis-Dreyfus' half-sister Lauren Bowles appeared as an extra at the party attended by George, Jerry and Elaine. Bowles would continue to appear regularly throughout the series' run, frequently as a waitress at Monk's Cafe. Additionally, David Blackwood, who appeared as a party guest, also continued to make small appearances on the show. Assistant director Joan Van Horn appeared as a woman feeding her baby at Monk's Cafe. The episode marks the first time Elaine does her trademark \\"Get Out!\\" shove; the catchphrase was not in the original script, but was added at Louis- Dreyfus' suggestion. It became one of the show's popular catchphrases. \\"The Apartment\\" is the first episode in which Jerry's apartment number is 5A; it had been changed a few times prior to the broadcast of this episode, but remained 5A until the end of the show. It is also contains one of the few references to Kramer's father, who remained unseen throughout the show's run. Reception The episode was first aired in the United States on NBC on April 4, 1991 as part of a Thursday night line-up that also included Cheers and L.A. Law. \\"The Apartment\\" gained a Nielsen rating of 16.9 and an audience share of 28, meaning that 16.9% of American households watched the episode, and that 28% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. Nielsen also estimated that 15.7 million homes were tuned into the episode, making Seinfeld the ninth most-watched show in the week the episode was broadcast, while 20.5 million homes tuned into Cheers. Seinfelds ability to keep a large number of Cheers audience eventually helped the show get a third season order. Ocala Star-Banner critic Jon Burlingame praised the episode for its \\"smart humor\\" and stated the show could be a perfect fit between Cheers and L.A. Law. Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling of Entertainment Weekly reacted very positively to the episode and praised Alexander's performance in particular, stating \\"George's profound self-hatred is now in full bloom ('Please, a little respect, for I am Costanza, Lord of the Idiots!'). Kramer's input, meanwhile, remains limited to off-the-wall, often annoying cameos. Which reminds us: Why in the world has Alexander been denied an Emmy, while Richards has scored two?\\" Schilling and Flaherty graded the episode with a B+. However, The Kitchener-Waterloo Record critic Bonnie Malleck gave the episode a particularly negative review; comparing Seinfeld to It's Garry Shandling's Show, she stated \\"Seinfeld isn't neurotic enough to be as funny as [Garry Shandling]. So, instead of being nervously funny, he's just nervously dull.\\" References External links  *\\"The Apartment\\" at Sony Pictures Category:Seinfeld (season 2) episodes Category:1991 American television episodes ","title":"The Apartment (Seinfeld)"},{"id":"5072808","text":"\\"The Statue\\" is the sixth episode of the second season of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld, and the show's 11th episode overall. In the episode, protagonist Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry Seinfeld) inherits some of his grandfather's old possessions. One of these is a statue, resembling one that his friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander) broke when he was ten years old. When Jerry sees the statue in the house of Ray (Michael D. Conway), the man who cleaned his apartment, he believes Ray stole the statue. Jerry struggles to get back at Ray, as his friend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is editing a book written by Ray's girlfriend. The episode was written by Larry Charles and directed by Tom Cherones. The character of Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) is developed in this episode, as he goes undercover as a cop to retrieve the statue. Charles was interested in the development of Kramer, as he felt George and Jerry had their counterparts in co-creators Larry David and Seinfeld. Richards enjoyed how Kramer acted in the episode and encouraged Charles to continue exploiting the character. \\"The Statue\\" first aired on NBC on April 11, 1991 in the United States and was watched by over 23 million American homes. Plot Jerry inherits some of his grandfather Irving's old possessions. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had until George broke it. Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed by the quality of the cleaning; however, when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry‚Äôs suspicion is confirmed. While discussing the situation later, Kramer urges Jerry to do something about it but Elaine argues that Rava will no longer let her edit her book if he does. Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry and George ask him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears about their suspicions. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, pretending to be a cop, and recovers the statue. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly pat on the back and causes him to drop the statue, which breaks when it hits the floor. The episode ends without ever revealing whether Ray had stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment. Cultural references * George explains that he broke the original statue while using it as a microphone and singing the song \\"MacArthur Park\\" by Jimmy Webb; in early drafts of the script, George broke it while singing Eddie Cochran's \\"Summertime Blues.\\" * The episode contains numerous references to the 1960s television crime drama Dragnet. This was because writer Larry Charles watched a lot of reruns of the show while writing for Seinfeld. Kramer's manner when he retrieves the statue was inspired by Joe Friday, the central character of Dragnet. * At the end of the episode Kramer states, \\"Well, let's put it this way: I didn't take him to People's Court\\", a reference to the judicial television show. Production Michael Richards was pleased with the development of the Kramer character in the episode and encouraged Charles to continue exploiting the Kramer character after the episode was filmed. The episode was written by Larry Charles and directed by Tom Cherones, who directed all of the episodes in Season 2. \\"The Statue\\" was the second episode Charles wrote for the show, though it was the first to be aired. Charles was mostly interested in the development of the Kramer character, as he felt \\"Jerry and George were so well-defined through Larry [David] and Jerry, that there was less room for me to, sort of, expand on those personas. But Kramer was very unformed at the beginning of the show and it gave me an area of creativity to, sort of, expand upon. So I spent a lot of time with Kramer because he was a character that I could have an impact on in the future of the show.\\" Richards enjoyed how his character evolved and, after the filming of the episode, went to Seinfeld, Charles and David and said \\"we should keep going that way.\\" He cites this episode, as well as \\"The Revenge\\" (in which Kramer puts concrete in a washing machine), as episodes that really defined the character. The first read-through of the episode was held on January 23, 1991, the same night the second season premiered. \\"The Statue\\" was filmed in front of a live audience six days later. A few scenes were changed prior to filming; in an early draft of the script Elaine sat next to George eavesdropping on Jerry and Ray's conversation. She would wear a floppy hat to look inconspicuous and complain about it, stating that she looks like one of the Cowsills, a singing group that was active between the 1960s and 1970s. The same scene initially featured George admitting that he spied on Ray a day earlier, showing Ray pictures of him in a bar. Ray would reply that it was his day off and asks why George is not at work, to which George replies that he should be getting back and leaves. In the original script, Elaine and Rava would argue over who is a better person: Jerry or Ray. Writer's assistant Karen Wilkie can be seen in the audience during Seinfeld's stand-up comedy act. Nurit Koppel, who portrayed Rava, was known for her appearance in the CBS television movie Sweet Bird of Youth (1989) as well as a guest appearance on the NBC crime drama Hunter. Jane Leeves, who later appeared as Marla the Virgin in season four and season nine, also auditioned for the part; she went on to star in the NBC sitcom Frasier (1993‚Äì2004). In the script, Ray Thomas' description was, \\"although he carries cleaning equipment, he also carries the air of a pretentious mannerly, affected actor.\\" Various actors auditioned for the part, including Hank Azaria, Michael D. Conway and Tony Shalhoub, who had also auditioned for the part of Kramer. Conway was eventually cast for the part. Norman Brenner, who worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons, appears as an extra; he appears in the background when Jerry and Ray talk at Monk's Cafe. Reception First broadcast in the United States on NBC on April 11, 1991, \\"The Statue\\" gained a Nielsen rating of 16.1 and an audience share of 26. This means that 16.1% of American households watched the episode, and that 26% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. Nielsen estimated that over 23 million people watched the episode's initial broadcast, making it the tenth most-watched program of the week it was broadcast in. The episode received mixed reactions from critics. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, critics Mary Kaye Schilling and Mike Flaherty stated \\"Even Seinfeld's bit players must have some grounding in reality ‚Äî you need to love to hate them. Ultimately, there's no redeeming comic payoff to Rava's and Ray's weirdness.\\" Flaherty and Schilling graded the episode with a C-. Colin Jacobson of the DVD Movie Guide called the episode's storyline \\"fairly pedestrian,\\" but felt the performances of Conway and Koppel saved the episode.

The story revolves around George Costanza's (Jason Alexander) plot to exact revenge on his boss, with his friend Elaine Benes' (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) help, after he quits his job at Rick Barr Properties and is refused re-employment. Meanwhile, Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld) and his neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) get even with a laundromat owner‚Äîwho they believe has stolen money from Jerry‚Äîby pouring cement into one of his washing machines. Written by series co-creator Larry David and directed by Tom Cherones, the episode premiered in the United States on NBC on April 18, 1991. Largely based on David's own experiences, \\"The Revenge\\" was the first episode he wrote without Seinfeld's collaboration. The episode also contains the first mention of Newman, a suicidal man who lives in Jerry and Kramer's apartment building, who would later become a popular recurring character. As the episode is the first in which Kramer does physical comedy for which the character would become well-known for, some cast and crew members consider it a turning point for the show. When first broadcast in the United States, the episode gained a Nielsen rating of 14.4/24 and was met with positive response from critics. Plot George furiously quits his job after being disallowed use of the executive toilet, but regrets the decision when he realizes he has no good job prospects. Jerry suggests that George go back to work and pretend he never quit. George takes this advice, but his former boss, Rick Levitan (Fred Applegate), refuses to let him stay and insults him. As revenge, George decides to slip a Mickey Finn into Levitan's drink during an office party and enlists Elaine to help him by flirting with him as a distraction. Levitan is enthralled by Elaine, and his good mood prompts him to let George have his job back. George attempts to intercept the drink, but after Levitan welcomes him back with a toast sprinkled with insults at George's expense, he changes his mind and lets him down the spiked drink. After being re-fired, George again regrets losing his temper with Levitan and brainstorms job opportunity ideas. When Jerry goes to the laundromat, Kramer persuades him to take his laundry with him. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. Vic, the owner of the laundromat, says he is not responsible for valuables; Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money. While Jerry distracts Vic with laundering questions, Kramer puts cement mix in one of the washing machines as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along. It turns out to be just enough to cover the damage to the washing machine. Kramer tells Jerry about his friend Newman, who repeatedly threatens to kill himself by jumping off the apartment building. When he does jump, he jumps from the second floor and survives, much to Kramer's amusement. When Newman threatens to jump again, Kramer asks Newman if he wants to go shoot some pool with him. Newman declines, stating that he has plans to go to the movies. Production alt=A smiling bald man with white hair around his ears. He is wearing a black jacket, grey T-shirt and glasses. \\"The Revenge\\" was written by series co-creator Larry David and directed by Tom Cherones. All prior Seinfeld episodes were co-written by Seinfeld and David. The Revenge is the first episode written by David alone, though Seinfeld did proofread the script and would continue to do so for all scripts up to the eighth season. George's storyline in the episode is based on David's own experiences while a writer at Saturday Night Live. David had quit SNL halfway through the 1984-1985 television season, but felt he had made a mistake once he reached his home. His neighbor Kenny Kramer, who later served as the main inspiration for Kramer, suggested David return to work the following Monday and act as if nothing had happened. Unlike George, the ploy succeeded for David, who remained with SNLs writing staff until the end of that season. George's reason for quitting was inspired by Seinfeld writer Larry Charles' use of the private restroom in Seinfeld and David's office instead of the public one. The Newman subplot was inspired by one of David's neighbors, who once jumped from the second floor of the apartment building in which they both lived. The unseen character Mr. Papanickolas, who is mentioned by Kramer, was named after production crew member Pete Papanickolas. \\"The Revenge\\" was first read by the cast of the show on February 13, 1991 and was filmed in front of a live audience on February 20, 1991. Filming of the episode had been delayed two days due to President's Day. Both Alexander and Louis-Dreyfus praised the scene in which Jerry and George discuss the types of employment George could apply for after he quit his job. Louis-Dreyfus stated she was jealous that she was not in the scene. A number of scenes in the episode were removed prior to broadcast, such as one in which George and Kramer meet in the hallway and Kramer informs George that Jerry has gone to the laundromat. The writers decided that George could just say Kramer told him Jerry was at the laundromat and, upon that addition, the scene was cut. Initially, during Jerry and George's conversation about jobs, George mentions Regis Philbin, when they discuss George being a talk show host. Additional dialogue between George and Jerry at the laundromat was also removed. Because the episode \\"The Stranded\\" did not air until mid season three, the few references \\"The Revenge\\" contained to the episode, were cut. The Newman subplot was significantly reduced; the character initially appeared in one scene, but it was never filmed. In that scene, he would have explained to Jerry and Kramer that he jumped from the roof, but an awning broke his fall, though Jerry and Kramer would remain skeptical. The episode also involved the second appearance of Harold the building superintendent, who had previously appeared in \\"The Apartment.\\" Harold would inform the main characters that Newman made up the story about the awning breaking his fall, though, with the reduction of the Newman subplot, the scene was removed. The cast considered the episode a turning point for the show. As a method actor, Richards insisted on dumping a real bag of cement into the washing machine used on set, so that the proper physical reactions to such a heavy object would be present. Richards stated that at that point, \\"rather than talking funny, I wanted to do funny.\\"Lavery & Dunne, p. 6 During the first take of the scene, Richards fell through a door and it had to be filmed again. \\"The Revenge\\" is also the first episode in which the George and Elaine characters collaborate. Louis-Dreyfus later stated that she and Alexander immediately had \\"some sort of shorthand with one another comedically, and [she] really relished that.\\" Although Newman's appearance was ultimately cut from the episode, auditions were held for the role; Tim Russ, who would go on to star in Star Trek: Voyager, auditioned, as did William Thomas, Jr., known for his appearance on The Cosby Show, who was cast in the part. Newman does share a brief dialogue with Kramer at the end of the episode, David recorded the lines, though he was not credited; this would be the first of David's 38 uncredited appearances on the show. The show's writing staff did not intend to have the character return in any later seasons, but because the idea of having actor Wayne Knight as a neighbor appealed to them, they re-cast Knight in the role of Newman in the character's first on-camera appearance in the season 3 episode \\"The Suicide.\\" Afterwards, Knight re- recorded Newman's lines for the syndicated version of this episode to establish better continuity. Both Knight's and David's dialogue were included on the Seinfeld: Volume 1 DVD boxset. Additionally, Fred Applegate guest- starred as George's boss and John Capodice portrayed Vic, the laundromat owner. Deck McKenzie, who worked as Seinfeld's stand-in, portrayed George's colleague Bill. Teri Austin portrayed Ava, a co-worker of George's; she would appear again later in \\"The Stranded,\\" which was filmed as part of season two, but aired as part of season three. Patrika Darbo, who played George's co- worker Glenda, would reappear later in the season five episode \\"The Sniffing Accountant\\" as a woman Newman flirts with. Reception First broadcast in the United States on NBC on April 18, 1991, Nielsen Media Research estimated that the episode gained a Nielsen rating of 14.4 and an audience share of 24. This means that 14.4% of American households watched the episode, and that 24% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. Seinfeld was the 15th most-watched program of the week it was broadcast in, and the sixth most- watched program broadcast on NBC. Entertainment Weekly reviewers Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling gave the episode a mixed review and graded it with a C, stating \\"Although neat for its parallel plotting and George's hilariously clueless career chats with Jerry, 'The Revenge' is not so sweet.\\" IGN critic Andy Patrizio considered \\"The Revenge\\" one of his personal favorites of season two. The scene in which Kramer struggles to put cement in one of the washing machines has gained positive responses from critics. Margery Eagan of The Boston Globe cited the scene as a perfect example of Kramer's personality. Neal Justin of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune also considers the scene to be one of the show's \\"classic moments.\\" Daily News of Los Angeles critic Jody Leader also praised Seinfeld for how he distracted Vic in the scene.

It aired on April 25, 1991. Plot While watching a science-fiction B movie, The Flaming Globes of Sigmund, Jerry falls asleep. He wakes in the middle of the night and scrawls a joke for his stand-up comedy act. The following day he is unable to read what he wrote down; a running gag in the episode has Jerry asking people what he wrote and they all offer different interpretations. While Jerry has lunch with George and Elaine at Monk's Caf√©, hoping they can interpret his scrawl, George becomes alarmed by pains in his chest and thinks he is having a heart attack; they have him transported to a hospital. The doctor informs him he actually needs a tonsillectomy he had had his tonsils removed when he was younger, but now they have grown back. Kramer, being paranoid about surgery, recommends a holistic healer as an alternative. Jerry warns George that the healer Kramer is recommending had spent time in prison, but, because of the large difference in price, George takes Kramer's advice. Elaine becomes attracted to George's doctor and goes on a date with him, only to discover that he has a fetish for tongues, which causes her to dump him once the date ends. George, Kramer, and Jerry meet Tor Eckman, the holistic healer (Stephen Tobolowsky). Eckman performs a number of hand gestures to identify George's ailment, which he concludes has nothing to do with his tonsils, but with his \\"imbalance with nature\\". He then concocts a tea containing cramp bark, cleavers, and couch grass that would cure him, also prescribing that George stop using hot water entirely. Upon drinking the tea, George becomes purple and has to be transported to the hospital again. On the way, the EMT (John Fleck) and the driver get into an altercation over a missing Chuckle. They stop the ambulance to fight outside. The driver beats the EMT bloody and leaves him in the street. While arguing with the passengers over this, he takes his eyes off the road, causing a crash. George and Jerry are put in neck braces and George has the tonsillectomy. Elaine visits briefly to give George some ice cream. The hospital television shows The Flaming Globes of Sigmund again, and Jerry remembers that what he wrote down was a line from the movie. As he realizes this, he notes \\"That's not funny.\\" Production \\"The Heart Attack\\" was written by Larry Charles. Like George, Charles had his tonsils removed and grow back later in life. He was inspired to write the ambulance scene by a news report about an ambulance driver and EMT who stopped an ambulance in the middle of traffic so that they could get out and have a fist fight, leaving a dying patient in the back. The doctor's tongue fetish was more extreme in Charles original draft, but these scenes were cut over concerns that they were too dark. Jerry's line \\"You're not a doctor, but you play one in real life\\" is a play on a famous line from a 1986 commercial for cough syrup: \\"I‚Äôm not a doctor, but I play one on TV.\\" In a bizarre coincidence, the episode seemingly makes an outlandish prediction when Jerry attempts to have Tor translate the note he wrote. Upon examining it, Tor laughs and mutters \\"Cleveland 117, San Antonio 109\\", leaving Jerry even more baffled. 28 years after the episode aired, the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the San Antonio Spurs 117-109. Reception Critical responses to the episode were mixed; Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling of Entertainment Weekly graded the episode with a D, writing \\"What Seinfeld excels at is finding the eccentric in the apparently normal. A kooky New Age doctor? That's hitting the broad side of a barn.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald critic Robin Oliver felt that, though he did not think the episode was bad, it was among Seinfelds lesser episodes. However, Andy Patrizio of IGN considered \\"The Heart Attack\\" one of season two's best episodes. St. Louis Post-Dispatch critic Eric Mink also reacted very positively on the episode, praising the Shakespeare reference and Michael Richards' performance in particular.

It is located on Mody Road in Tsim Sha Tsui East overlooking Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong Island skyline. It is the sister hotel to the Island Shangri-La in Admiralty district, Hong Kong.  History  The history of the Kowloon property is tied to the history of the Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts, which began with the opening of the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore in 1971. The Kuok Group that built the Singapore hotel put the management of it under Western International Hotels, before Kuok themselves entered the hotel management world in 1979 when Kuok Hotels was formed to manage the Rasa Sayang Resort and Spa in Penang, Golden Sands Resort in Penang, and The Fijian, Yanuca Island, on Fiji. The Kowloon Shangri-La hotel opened on 17 June 1981 and was managed by Westin just as it Shangri-La predecessors, but a year later the Kuok Group created Shangri-La International Hotel Management Ltd. In April 1991,Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts assumed management of the Kowloon from Westin, as well as all hotels it had owned until that point. The facade of Kowloon Shangri-La Hotel To celebrate its 30th anniversary in 2011, the hotel held an exhibition of photographs submitted by the public, from guests who had visited from around the world during the three decades since its opening.

The episode centers on protagonists Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld) and Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) who decide to have a sexual relationship, with a set of ground rules. However, as their \\"relationship\\" progresses, they experience difficulties maintaining their original friendship. Series co-creator Larry David wrote the episode in a response to NBC's continued efforts to get the two characters back together. The main inspiration behind the episode was a similar agreement David once made with a woman. The episode, which introduced the character of Tina, Elaine's roommate, first aired on May 2, 1991 and was watched by approximately 22.6 million viewers. Critics reacted positively to the episode, and David received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. Plot As they are watching TV in Jerry's apartment, Jerry and Elaine flip through the channels, stumbling upon the soft-core pornography channel. Upon the realization that neither of them has had sexual relations in a while, they start toying with the idea of sleeping together. However, as they do not wish to ruin their friendship, they establish a set of ground rules. Happy with their agreement, they make their way to the bedroom. The next day Jerry has lunch with his friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), and tells him of his situation with Elaine. George remains skeptical, even after Jerry explains the rules system to him. Jerry and Elaine get into an argument over the second rule: \\"Spending the night is optional\\". Jerry eventually does not spend the night, leaving their agreement on shaky terms. With Elaine's birthday coming up Jerry has to decide on what to get her. Since they are friends but they are still having sex he feels that the symbolism of the gift needs to be carefully thought out. He looks for a gift with George but is unable to think of anything, though he remembers her saying \\"something about a bench\\". Elaine is unhappy with the eventual gift ($182 cash) and outright insulted by the platonic gift card. When Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) gives Elaine the bench she was looking for, for which she is very grateful, she and Jerry talk over their agreement. Jerry proposes that they go back to being simply friends, but Elaine is so upset by the birthday that she feels unable to go on with either a friendly or sexual relationship with Jerry. When Kramer sees them again, however, Jerry and Elaine have made up and are a couple. Production Series co-creator Larry David wrote the episode, based on a personal experience. Series co-creator Larry David wrote the episode, which was directed by Tom Cherones. Since the start of the show, NBC executives, especially Warren Littlefield, had been pressuring the writing staff to get Jerry and Elaine back together. Larry David had been against this idea from the start. However, brainstorming for an episode idea, he remembered he had once made a deal with a woman to have a purely physical relationship, which he thought \\"would make a really funny show, even if they had never [told us to get Jerry and Elaine back together]\\". Though Jerry and Elaine are still in a relationship at the end of the episode, they are no longer together by the end of the season. This was because \\"The Deal\\" was the last episode filmed for the season, but like most of the episodes in the second season, it was aired out of order. Jerry and Elaine are not together, however, by the start of the third season. Seinfeld and David decided that they had satisfied the NBC executives and went back to the original format. Seinfeld and David have also noted that \\"The Deal\\" is the only Seinfeld episode ever to contain sincere emotions, during the scene in which Jerry and Elaine discuss the ending of their physical relationship. On February 25, 1991, the table-read of the episode was held, subsequent filming occurred at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California three days later. \\"The Deal\\" is the first episode in which Elaine's apartment is shown. During rehearsals controversy arose over how Jerry and Elaine would sit during their \\"this and that\\" conversation. Several producers believed that, as the scene was intimate, the two should sit close together. David, however, believed the discussion was more of a transaction than an intimate scene and felt that Jerry and Elaine should sit farther apart. On audio commentary recorded for the Seinfeld: Volume 1 DVD set, David commented that when he showed his idea of the scene, \\"I remember everybody saying 'there's no heat, there's no heat', and I said, that's the point, there's not supposed to be any\\". David and producer Andrew Scheinman got into a big argument over the issue, which David eventually won. Aside from showing Elaine's apartment for the first time, \\"The Deal\\" also marks the first appearance of Elaine's roommate Tina, who had been mentioned in earlier episodes. Siobhan Fallon was cast in the role; she would reprise the character two more times, in season three's \\"The Truth\\" and in the season five finale \\"The Opposite\\". Norman Brenner, who worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons, appears as an extra, working in the store George and Jerry visit to look for a gift for Elaine. Reception \\"The Deal\\" was first broadcast on May 2, 1991 on NBC and received a Nielsen rating of 15.5 and an audience share of 25, indicating that 15.5 percent of American households watched the episode, and that 25 percent of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. With averagely 22.6 million homes watching the episode, the series was the eleventh most-watched show in the week it was broadcast, tied with NBC's The Golden Girls. David received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series, but lost the award to Gary Dontzig and Steven Peterman, writers of the Murphy Brown episode \\"Jingle Hell, Jingle Hell, Jingle All the Way\\". Critics reacted positively to the episode. Eric Kohanik of The Hamilton Spectator called \\"The Deal\\" a \\"hilarious episode\\". Entertainment Weekly critics Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling commented \\"Jerry and Elaine's circuitous verbal dance pondering the relative worth of that [sex] versus this [the friendship] is sublime. The show's ability to be both explicit and vague will become a hallmark.\\" References External links  Category:Seinfeld (season 2) episodes Category:1991 American television episodes ","title":"The Deal (Seinfeld)"},{"id":"5072820","text":"\\"The Baby Shower\\" is the tenth episode of the second season of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld, and the show's 15th episode overall. In the episode, Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) throws a baby shower for her friend Leslie (Christine Dunford) at Jerry's (Jerry Seinfeld) apartment, while he is out of town. Jerry's friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander) once had a terrible date with Leslie and confronts her at the shower. Meanwhile, Jerry is convinced by his neighbour Kramer (Michael Richards) to install illegal cable television. Larry Charles wrote the episode, which was directed by Tom Cherones, and was partly based on a friend of his who was pregnant but did not want to experience childbirth. All of the characters' storylines intersect in the final scenes, an element that the writing staff would continue to use in later episodes. The episode's first broadcast in the United States on May 16, 1991 gained a Nielsen rating of 12.4/21 and was negatively received by critics. Plot Elaine holds a baby shower for her friend Leslie at Jerry's apartment, while Jerry is performing in Buffalo. George is excited, as the baby shower is an opportunity to confront the woman who gave him the worst date of his life by pouring Bosco chocolate sauce on his red collared shirt while doing performance art. Jerry is frustrated by his television's bad reception, and is convinced by Kramer to have cable illegally installed by two Russians (Vic Polizos and James Lashly). Jerry is tormented with guilt and fear over the illegal cable. His show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport so that he can encounter Leslie at the baby shower while wearing the red shirt. Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install the cable, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George cannot muster the courage to tell Leslie off and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. One of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but agrees to pay the Russians the full price for their trouble. However, he is irate when the charge turns out to be several times what Kramer told him it would be. He refuses to pay, and the Russians retaliate by breaking the picture tube of his television set.

His right hand is in his pocket and he holds a microphone to his mouth with his left hand. \\"The Baby Shower\\" was written by Larry Charles and directed by Tom Cherones, who directed all of season two's episodes. The episode was the first episode written by Charles, who would remain with the show through the fifth season. Charles had met Seinfeld co-creator Larry David and Richards when he was part of the writing staff of the ABC sketch show Fridays and David and Richards were part of the show's ensemble cast. He had been unable to write for the show's first season, as Charles had been writing for The Arsenio Hall Show during its production. Charles frequently had difficulty with writing Jerry's stand-up material; therefore, in \\"The Baby Shower\\", Seinfeld used some of his own material. The episode was a combination of loose storylines that had been brought to the writers table. Charles explained that the writing staff of the show considered it a challenge to weave together loose ideas into one episode.Lavery & Dunne, p. 6 The episode was partly based on a friend of Charles, who was pregnant but did not want to experience childbirth and therefore asked the doctor to anesthetize her. Charles thought this was very ironic. The Leslie character was largely based on Karen Finley and Johanna Went, two performance artists who both used foods in their acts, Charles considered them \\"a ripe target for satire\\". As Charles was always trying to find elements that were unusual in sitcoms, the episode had a scene in which Jerry dreams he is interrogated by the FBI for his illegal cable hookup, and is killed by their gunfire while trying to escape. Charles recalled the dream sequence as \\"one of the most ambiguous scenes we did [in season two]\\" and felt it was very Tarantino-like. At the end of the dream Kramer holds Jerry in his arm, stating \\"what have you done to my little cable boy?\\"; this scene had to be filmed multiple times, as it was hard for Seinfeld not to laugh when Richards stated the line. In audio commentary he recorded for the Seinfeld: Volume 1 DVD set, Charles noted how he established three of the episode's four storylines in one scene, in which the characters eat and talk at Monk's Cafe. \\"The Baby Shower\\" also is one of the few episodes of season two in which the primary storylines of all four characters come together in the final scene. In \\"The Busboy\\", which had been filmed earlier, the four storylines also intersected in the final scene, but the episode aired as the final episode of season two. Charles also felt the episode defined the Kramer character more, as it is the first episode in which Kramer speaks out against the system. In addition, the episode also establishes Elaine's interest in the Kennedys, a plot element that would return later in the season four episode \\"The Virgin\\". \\"The Baby Shower\\" was first read by the show's cast on November 14, 1990. It was filmed in front of a live audience on November 20. A technique called \\"Poor Man's Process\\" was used during the car scene with George and Jerry; one or two crew members would shake the car to give the impression that it was moving, though it never actually was. Other crew members would move lights around the set to simulate street lights or headlights of other cars. Behind the car, two lights on a wheeled stand were placed to give the impression that there was a car behind it. A cheap plastic sticker was put on Jerry's television screen to give the impression that it was broken. A number of scenes were changed or cut during production of the episode. In early drafts of the script, the episode opened with Kramer telling Jerry about the Russian cable installers. In the first draft of the script Elaine and Jerry would realize ahead of time that the baby shower and the cable installation would take place at the same time. This was changed as the writers felt it would be better left as a surprise. Some dialogue was removed from the scene, as Kramer initially told Jerry Benjamin Franklin would have wanted free cable. Additional dialogue between the baby shower guests regarding turning off men was also cut. The scene in which Mary Cantardi, a woman Jerry went out with once but never called afterwards, makes a scene at the baby shower was not in the original script, but was added during rehearsals to give Seinfeld more involvement in the final scene. Don Perry guest starred as an airplane passenger next to Jerry, when he wakes up from his nightmare. Perry states that he might be the last person Jerry will see alive. This line was not in the original script, but was added because Perry, as Charles explained, \\"just had the right look\\". Christine Dunford was cast as Leslie, Charles commented \\"she just came in; gave a great reading. At this point in our show business history, I don't think we knew anybody\\". Dunford would return later as a saleswoman in the season five episode \\"The Pie\\". Margaret Reed, best known for her role on the soap opera As the World Turns, appeared as Mary Cantardi, a woman who screams at Jerry for not calling her back after a date. Vic Polizos and James Lashly guest-starred as the Russian cable installers. Norman Brenner, who worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons, appears as an extra in the first scene of the episode, standing at the counter at Monk's Cafe. Reception \\"The Baby Shower\\" was first broadcast in the United States on NBC on May 16, 1991. It received a Nielsen rating of 12.4 and an audience share of 21, indicating that 12.4% of American households watched the episode, and that 21% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. \\"The Baby Shower\\" met with negative responses from critics. Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling of Entertainment Weekly graded the episode with a D, stating \\"After a promising opening, this baby quickly degenerates into heavy-handed farce\\". The episode was ranked third on a list of Seinfelds \\"Not-so-top episodes\\", compiled by the New York Daily News.

The episode revolves around protagonist Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld) and his friends Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and George Costanza (Jason Alexander) waiting for a table at a Chinese restaurant, on their way to see a one-night showing of a movie. George tries to use the phone that is constantly occupied and Jerry recognizes a woman, but he is unsure where he has seen her before. Co-written by the series' creators Seinfeld and head writer Larry David, the episode is set in real time, without any scene-breaks. It was the first of two episodes in which Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) did not appear (the other being \\"The Pen\\"). Considered a \\"bottle episode\\", NBC executives objected to its production and broadcast due to its lack of an involved storyline, thinking that audiences would be uninterested. It was not until David threatened to quit if the network forced any major changes upon the script that NBC allowed the episode to be produced, though the network postponed broadcast to the near end of season two. First broadcast in the United States on May 23, 1991, the episode gained a Nielsen rating of 11.7/21. Television critics reacted positively to \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\", which is widely considered as one of the show's \\"classic episodes\\". In 1998, a South Florida Sun-Sentinel critic wrote that the episode, along with season four's \\"The Contest\\", \\"broke new sitcom ground\\". Plot Jerry, George, and Elaine decide to eat dinner without a reservation at a Chinese restaurant before seeing a one-night showing of Plan 9 from Outer Space. The ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel (James Hong) repeatedly tells the party they will receive a table in \\"5, 10 minutes\\". Besides having only a short time until the movie begins, they have other worries. Jerry previously lied to his uncle, saying he could not join him for dinner; he prefers to see the movie, yet feels guilty. He notices a woman (Judy Kain) at the restaurant he has seen before, but cannot remember who she is. When the mysterious woman greets Jerry, he remembers that she is his uncle's receptionist and becomes upset, knowing that she'll tell his uncle, who will spread the story on the family grapevine. George is anxious because, the night before, he left his girlfriend Tatiana during sex because he needed to use a bathroom and thought hers was too close to her bedroom to provide enough privacy. He wants to call Tatiana to invite her to join them, but the restaurant's payphone is first occupied by a man (Michael Mitz) who ignores George, and then by a woman who is rude to him. By the time George gets the phone, Tatiana has left, so he leaves a message. Tatiana calls the restaurant to reach George, but the ma√Ætre d' calls out \\"Cartwright\\"; George does not recognize this as a mispronunciation of his surname, so he tells her that George is not there. Elaine is extremely hungry. Jerry dares her to take an egg roll from someone's plate and eat it, offering her $50 to do so. Elaine approaches a table and offers to split the $50 50‚Äì50 with the party. As she softly speaks the offer, they fail to comprehend her. She awkwardly walks away, then laughs off her attempt. Elaine tries bribing the ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel to give them a table immediately, but he fails to pick up on her hints. Elaine is still ravenous, but refuses to eat concession stand food at the movie theater. After missing Tatiana's call, George decides he's no longer in the mood for the movie, Elaine wants to leave and get a hamburger, and Jerry decides that he might as well have dinner with his uncle. As soon as they leave, the ma√Ætre d' calls their party. Production \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" was written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and directed by Tom Cherones, who directed all of the episodes in season two. David came up with the idea of the real-time episode while he and Seinfeld were waiting for a table at a Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles. When David presented the episode to NBC executives, he received a negative reaction. The network felt that there was no real story and viewers would not be interested. Executive Warren Littlefield commented that he thought there were pages missing from the script he had received. David argued that each character had a storyline: Jerry's story was he recognized a woman but did not know from where; Elaine's story was that she was very hungry; and George's story was that he was unable to use the phone. NBC disagreed and objected to the broadcast of the episode. To satisfy the executives, staff writer Larry Charles suggested the group's storyline to be on their way to a one-night screening of Plan 9 from Outer Space, and thus introducing a \\"ticking clock\\" scenario to the story. When the NBC executives still objected, David threatened to quit the show if the network would force any major changes upon the script. Seinfeld supported David and NBC eventually allowed them to produce \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" without any significant alterations, although they strongly advised them not go through with it, and postponed the broadcast until near the end of the season. In 2015, Seinfeld writer Spike Feresten revealed that the host's calling \\"Cartwright\\" instead of \\"Costanza\\" was a subtle allusion to the classic western show Bonanza. \\"Bonanza\\" rhymes with \\"Costanza\\" and the show's main characters are the \\"Cartwright\\" family. \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" was first read by its cast on December 5, 1990, and it was filmed on December 11. Filming took place at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where all filming for the second season took place. As only one location was used, it took roughly half of the time it usually took for an episode to be filmed. Cast members have remarked that the filming was shorter than on any other episode. A few changes were made; in the first draft of the script, George, Jerry, and Elaine entered the restaurant talking about their least favorite holiday. In the version that aired, they talk about combining the jobs of policemen and garbagemen into a single job. In the original draft, the three friends also discussed how to spend the long waiting period in the future, with George suggesting they bring a deck of cards and that Jerry bring a jigsaw puzzle with nothing but penguins. One scene was cut before broadcast, featuring George explaining to Jerry that he pulled his hamstring while trying to untuck the covers of a hotel bed during his recent stay in Boston. George can be seen grabbing his hamstring as he walks to the phone. The scene was later included on the Seinfeld seasons one and two DVD boxset. George makes the same claim about his hamstring in \\"The Limo\\". At one point in the episode, Jerry mentions having a sister; however, she is never mentioned again in the series. =Cast= \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" was the first episode that did not feature regular character Kramer (Michael Richards), Jerry's neighbor. David explained that the reason for Kramer's absence was because‚Äîduring Seinfelds early seasons‚Äîthe character never left his apartment and did not go out with the other three. Richards was still displeased with the absence of his character, as he felt the episode was a breakthrough and‚Äîas such‚Äîessential for the series' development. In an interview for the Seinfeld first and second season DVD box set, he commented, \\"The Chinese restaurant episode was so unique, and I just wanted to be a part of that because it was cutting edge. I knew that was a very important episode; it was so odd.\\" Michael Mitz‚Äîwho portrayed one of the payphone occupants‚Äîwould return in season five as a photographer in \\"The Puffy Shirt\\". The ma√Ætre d' was portrayed by actor James Hong; it is one of the actor's most famous roles in the United States. (In fact, he had a small part in a season one episode of The Bob Newhart Show in 1972, portraying a man who is mistaken for a ma√Ætre d'. He also played a similar maitre d' role in the 1961 movie Flower Drum Song.) Judy Kain‚Äîknown for a recurring role on Married... with Children‚Äîguest-starred as Lorraine Catalano, the receptionist of Jerry's uncle. David Tress guest-starred as Mr. Cohen, a guest who enters the restaurant and receives a table without reservation, as he is good friends with the ma√Ætre d'. Larry David's voice can be heard among the group of elderly people Elaine offers money to for one of their egg-rolls. Norman Brenner‚Äîwho worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons‚Äîappears as an extra; he is sitting by the door of the restaurant when George, Jerry, and Elaine enter, and is still at the same spot when they leave. Themes The episode is widely considered to encapsulate Seinfelds \\"show about nothing\\" concept, with The Tampa Tribune critic Walt Belcher calling it \\"the ultimate episode about nothing\\", and Lavery and Dunne describing it as \\"existential\\".Lavery & Dunne, p. 32 Critics had a similar reaction to season three's \\"The Parking Garage\\", in which the four central characters spent the whole episode looking for their car. The structure of \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\"‚Äîdescribed as \\"elongation\\"‚Äîdrags a small event out over the course of an entire episode. Lavery and Dunne suggest that this structure critiques sitcoms with implied moral lessons (such as those found in so-called \\"very special episodes\\").Lavery & Dunne, p. 82 Vincent Brook‚Äîas part of his analysis regarding the influence of Jewish culture on Seinfeld‚Äîhas said that the episode also conveys the theme of entrapment and confinement in a small space, a recurring theme on the show. The relationship between the characters and food is another recurring theme of the series. In Seinfeld, specific food items are associated with individual characters and food itself is a \\"signifier of social contracts\\".Lavery & Dunne, pp. 148‚Äì149 Linda S. Ghent, Professor in the Department of Economics at Eastern Illinois University, discusses some economic issues in this episode. Just before Jerry's dare about the egg roll, Elaine says, \\"You know, it's not fair people are seated first come first served. It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.\\" Ghent discusses the history and reasoning behind rationing mechanisms and economic efficiency, which are the basis behind how tables are seated at restaurants, rationales which are perhaps invisible to hungry or impatient customers. Elaine's attempt at bribery is an example of opportunity cost: the trio are willing to pay more than usual to get a table, if it means Elaine can eat sooner and Jerry makes it to the movie on time. Ghent also gives Jerry's willingness to lie to his uncle as another example of opportunity cost: \\"Did I do a bad thing by lying to my uncle and saying I couldn't go to dinner? Plan Nine from Outer Space ‚Äì one night only, the big screen! My hands are tied!\\" Reception When the episode initially aired in the United States on NBC on May 23, 1991, it received a Nielsen rating of 11.7 and an audience share of 21‚Äîthis meant that 11.7% of American households watched the episode, and that 21% of televisions in use at the time were tuned to it. Seinfeld was the eighteenth most-watched show of the week, and the sixth most-watched show on NBC. It was believed that NBC executives held a meeting after the broadcast to determine the fate of the show, and decided it would receive a third season order if the writers would put more effort into episode storylines. However, the 1991 fall schedule had already been announced on May 21 and the show was on the schedule. \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" received very positive responses from critics and is considered one of Seinfelds first \\"classic episodes\\". Kit Boss, a critic for the Ocala Star-Banner, wrote that the episode was \\"like real life, but with better dialogue\\". Various critics and news sources have praised how the episode defines the show's \\"show about nothing\\" concept. Critics have also noted that aside from being a turning point for the show, the episode also became a turning point for television sitcoms; one South Florida Sun-Sentinel critic commented that the episode, along with the season four episode \\"The Contest\\", \\" broke new sitcom ground and expanded the lexicon of the '90s.\\" Vance Durgin of The Orange County Register praised how the show \\"wrung\\" so much comedy \\"out of a simple premise\\". The episode was also included in a list compiled by The Star-Ledger called \\"50 events that shaped TV ‚Äì and our lives\\" between 1900 and 1999. The Charlotte Observer has called \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" the best Seinfeld episode, referring to it \\"the very epitome of the classic Seinfeld format\\". Critics also praised Louis-Dreyfus' and Alexander's performances; The Age critic Kenneth Nguyen stated that they \\"characteristically, rock[ed] their line readings\\".

The episode was the 12th and final episode of the show's second season. It aired on June 26, 1991. Plot Jerry, George, and Elaine are at dinner when a menu on an adjacent table catches on fire. George puts it out and explains to the manager that the busboy, Antonio (David Labiosa), left the menu too close to a lit candle. Elaine jokingly declares she is never eating there again. The manager gets in an argument with the busboy and immediately fires him. Elaine and especially George fear their remarks may have caused the firing. George and Kramer visit Antonio's ramshackle apartment to apologize, much to George's discomfort. Things get only worse when they accidentally leave the door open, letting his cat out, and his lamp gets broken. A few days later, Antonio comes to Jerry's apartment to see George, who is terrified that he will hurt him. Instead, Antonio tells him that there was a gas line explosion at the restaurant that killed five employees, including the busboy hired to replace him. Moreover, his search for his cat was both successful and led him to stumble upon a better-paying job. He thanks George for inadvertently saving his life and getting him a better job. Elaine faces having her boyfriend Ed stay with her for a week. Increasingly irritated by the live-in situation, she puts him onto a plane back to Seattle, only to oversleep and on the way to JFK International Airport and encounter a five-car pileup on Rockaway Blvd. With her boyfriend still with her, he gets into a shouting match and eventually a fistfight in the hallway of Jerry's apartment building with Antonio, resulting in injuries on both ends after they fall down several flights of stairs. The busboy loses his new job, George is forced to take care of his cat, and Elaine's boyfriend is bedridden at her apartment for several more weeks. Production This episode was noted by the supporting cast in an interview used for a DVD set as the first sign that Jerry would be a generous writer, being very good about including the co-stars into simultaneous story lines. Jerry himself does not have a lead role in either of the episode's plots. Larry David credits this episode as the first time that multiple storylines intertwined. This episode was filmed in October 1990, simultaneously with \\"The Pony Remark\\" and \\"The Ex-Girlfriend\\". In popular culture In this episode, George claims to know the best public toilets anywhere in Manhattan. In the seventh season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry has written the reunion so that George has parlayed this knowledge into an iPhone app called \\"iToilet\\", which the fictionalized version of Jerry would describe as \\"An iPhone application that leads you via your GPS to the nearest acceptable toilet wherever you are in the world\\". \\"La puerta esta abierta\\", a line the busboy uses, may have been taken from the children's television show Sesame Street.  Reception  At 12.5 million viewers, this episode had the fewest viewers for any Seinfeld episode in its original airing. David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+.

It is the first episode of the show's third season. It aired on September 18, 1991. Plot During a physical therapy massage, Jerry frightens his therapist by talking about a small boy who was kidnapped in Pennsylvania, suggesting that he could also be a deranged kidnapper, and then asking questions about the therapist's own son. George later becomes very uncomfortable when he is assigned a man as his masseuse, fearing the massage might turn into a homosexual experience. He tells Jerry that he felt the beginnings of an erection during the massage. The two of them discuss whether or not this means George is homosexual, with Jerry arguing the con position. Kramer claims he saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts but the others do not believe him. According to Kramer, DiMaggio was a very focused eater‚Äîthe same way he used to play; to prove his point, he made noises (such as banging the table and yelping), which DiMaggio ignored. George convinces Jerry to ask his dentist Roy for a note, allowing the group to secure free massages. In Roy's office, George's insecurity over his sexuality resurfaces when Roy asks for his opinion of Evander Holyfield. Roy later comes under investigation for passing around fake notes. Jerry tries to see the physical therapist once more, but she refuses because she's afraid he will kidnap her son. While eating in Monk's, Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer all see Joe DiMaggio dunking his donuts. Kramer once again bangs the table and yelps to demonstrate DiMaggio's unbreakable concentration. Theme song This was the only episode - other than the original pilot - with a different version of the theme song. Female singers harmonize over the iconic slap-bass tune, an addition made by composer Jonathan Wolff at the request of Jerry Seinfeld, who wanted to add \\"a little sparkle\\" to the music, suggesting the addition of some scat lyrics. Seinfeld and executive producer Larry David both liked Wolff's additions, and three episodes were produced with the new style music. However, they had neglected to inform NBC and Castle Rock of the change, and when the season premiere aired, the latter were surprised and unimpressed, and requested that they return to the original style. The subsequent two episodes were redone, leaving this episode as the only one with the additional music elements.\\"Seinfeld - Season 3\\" DVD bonus material, \\"Inside Look\\". Since this episode's end credits played \\"Joltin' Joe DiMaggio\\" in place of the theme tune, the full version of the revised theme was never used.

Plot Years earlier, Kramer managed to persuade Jerry to donate to a fake relief fund for an upcoming Krakatoa eruption (which last erupted in 1883). In the present day, Jerry is now being audited by the IRS as a result of the fraudulent fund. George gives Jerry's tax papers to his girlfriend Patrice (played by Valerie Mahaffey), an accountant and former representative for the IRS, but he has trouble getting around her pretensions and showy pronunciation habits. At Monk's, George breaks up with Patrice, telling her that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not you. It‚Äôs me.‚Äù After Patrice insists on the real reasons, George tells her the truth. Patrice promptly grabs her handbag and leaves. When Jerry finds out, he gets upset, as she took the tax papers with her. Meanwhile, Elaine gets tired of Kramer dating her roommate Tina (played by Siobhan Fallon). She complains about spaghetti sauce on the strainer, loud tribal music, and the make-out sessions. Later, after showing Jerry a windshield that he found on the side of the road, Kramer proposes to use it as a coffee table. When Elaine enters, she expresses her unhappiness that Kramer unknowingly walked into Elaine's bedroom and saw her naked. Upon learning that Patrice checked into a depression clinic (described as a \\"mental institution\\" by George), Jerry and George go to visit her. When George introduces her to Jerry, she recognizes him as \\"the Jerome with the tax problems.\\" She reveals to them that after she left George, she got upset and threw out Jerry's tax papers. Unfortunately, Jerry never made copies of the many receipts that he had collected over the years. Elaine enters her apartment with dirty dishes piled high in the kitchen, loud tribal music playing, and Kramer dancing with only a towel wrapped around his waist. When Tina and Kramer ask Elaine if she is upset, she decides, after thinking about the problems George caused by telling the truth, to lie. She tells them they are a great couple. Kramer and Tina soon begin the African dance together but accidentally break the windshield coffee table as they move to the couch to make-out, severely injuring themselves and leading to Tina being admitted to the hospital.

It also inhabits the southern lowlands and south east peninsula of Papua New Guinea. Description This species of frog is very variable in colour and patterning. It reaches 55 mm in length, has extremely long legs, and is very streamlined. Its dorsal surface is a shade of brown with longitudinal skin folds or warts that are darker in colour than the skin around them. The ventral surface is white and granular. A brown stripe starts from the nostril, goes across the eye, through the tympanum and ends between the armpit and groin. The tympanum is brown with a white circle surrounding it. The thighs are marked with black lines on a yellow background. Throats of breeding males are yellow. Although being a 'tree frog', this species spends most of its life as an adult on land, due to its inability to climb because of its small discs. Ecology and behaviour This frog inhabits swamps, ponds, and flooded grasslands in forests and open woodland. The call is a 'wick... wick' repeated several times followed by a 'but... but'; the call may last for several seconds. Males call from spring through early autumn while sitting around the bank of a water body or in shallow water. Breeding increases after rain. This frog can leap 2 m (6.5 ft), roughly 36 times its own length. This would be the equivalent of a 1.8 m (6 ft) human making a jump 64.8 m (105 ft) long. Similar species This species is a member of the rocket frog complex, which includes many species, for example Freycinet's frog (Litoria freycineti) and broad-palmed frog (L. latopalmata). All species in this complex are very agile jumpers and often contain \\"rocket frog\\" in the common name and have a duck- like quacking or wicking call. L. nasuta is sympatric with every species in this complex through at least part of its range. The dorsolateral stripes and skin folds on this species are best used to distinguish this species from others in the complex. The Australian wood frog, (Rana daemeli) is physically similar to this species and others in the complex. R. daemeli and L. nasuta both occur in the northern part of the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland. As a pet It is kept as a pet, and in Australia this animal may be kept in captivity with the appropriate permit. References *Anstis, M. 2002. Tadpoles of South-eastern Australia.

The episode was the fourth episode of the show's third season. It was written by series co-creator Larry David and first aired on October 9, 1991. Plot Jerry is on a plane returning to New York City when a drunk man, Gavin Polone (played by Joseph Maher), seated next to him falls sick and asks Jerry to take care of his dog while he is taken to the hospital. He promises to reclaim the dog when he comes to New York. The dog, Farfel, irritates Jerry with its barking and making messes. Jerry feels as though he does not dare leave his apartment, for fear of what Farfel might do. Jerry, George and Elaine had a date to see the movie Prognosis Negative, but Jerry asks them to go without him. George and Elaine realize they don't have much in common without Jerry around; they begin to have a good conversation only when they start making fun of Jerry. Kramer tells Jerry and Elaine he is looking forward to breaking up with his girlfriend, Ellen, because she is such a vile human being. Jerry and Elaine reveal that they agree with his assessment of her personality and only kept quiet about it for fear of offending him. Kramer indeed breaks up with Ellen in a melodramatic fashionand shortly after reunites in the same fashion. He then holds a grudge against Jerry and Elaine for their earlier derisive remarks about Ellen, announcing an end to their friendship. When Kramer and Ellen break up again, Jerry and Elaine tell Kramer they are disappointed by the breakup, having learned their lesson. Jerry, tired of having to put up with Farfel, tries to contact Gavin, but finds out that he checked out of the hospital several days ago. He decides to take the dog to the city pound so that he, George and Elaine can go to the movies together. This upsets Elaine, who persuades him to let her stay with the dog for one more day while he and George go to the movies without her. Elaine's attitude towards the dog changes dramatically when she finds out how disobedient Farfel is. When Gavin finally calls, Elaine angrily tells him to come and collect Farfel or else he has \\"humped his last leg\\". Gavin reveals he was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, the reason he could not call earlier, and comes for the dog, much to the relief of Jerry and Elaine. Production In a deleted scene, Kramer reveals that he fed Farfel turkish taffy, which would have explained the dog's erratic behavior and frequent barking. Cultural references A writer for Mental Floss explains, > \\"Farfel\\" wasn't just some random wacky name Gavin Palone made up for his > pooch; he was, in fact, named after the famous floppy-eared puppet who used > to advertise Nestle's Quik in the 1960s.

During the episode, Elaine makes two egg creams in Jerry's kitchen while they discuss the dog.  Critical reception  David Sims of The A.V. Club, giving a grade of B+, writes that the episode is \\"an amusingly over-the-top one, with not one but two unseen, horrible characters, and it's the first episode with those great fake Seinfeld movie names. ... We never see the dog, and since he's a satanic hound that barks constantly and chews everything he sees, it's all the funnier that we don't. The \\"evil dog\\" joke gets old quickly but it works just enough because Jerry's OCD tendencies are so profoundly disturbed by having the dog in his bedroom.\\" Legacy Jerry delivers a monologue on people and dogs: This has been quoted (and mis-quoted) enough to permeate the culture, approaching catchphrase standards.

Plot After Kramer purchases an air conditioner from a shopping mall in New Jersey, no one can remember where his car was parked in the multi- level parking garage. After carrying the air conditioner for some time, an exhausted Kramer leaves it behind one of the parked cars and tries to memorize the number of the parking space. Elaine fears that her new goldfish will die in the bag before they can arrive home, George must meet his parents by 6:15 to take them out to celebrate their anniversary, and Jerry has to go to the bathroom badly. Elaine begs various people in the parking garage to give them a ride around the building to find their car, but no one is willing to help. Kramer badgers Jerry to urinate in a corner where no one can see him. After Jerry reluctantly does so, he is spotted by a security guard and taken to the guard's office. Jerry tries to talk his way out of trouble by making up a stories about a fictional disease of \\"uromysitisis poisoning\\", before telling the truth. Elaine, Kramer, and George split up to find Jerry. George also gets caught in the act of urinating after being convinced to do so by Kramer. Both Jerry and George are fined and released. After the two find Elaine, Jerry convinces George to ask an attractive woman (Cynthia Ettinger) to give them a lift around the garage. The woman accepts, and they all enter her car and drive off. She kicks them out after George makes disparaging remarks about Scientology, not realizing she is a Scientologist. They are dropped off right by Kramer's car but Kramer, who has the car keys, is still lost somewhere in the garage. Hours pass by as George, Jerry and Elaine wait. Finally, Kramer shows up, having gone on a hunt for the air conditioner because he forgot where he left it. Elaine's goldfish did not survive and George is well past the deadline to meet his parents. They all get in the car, but the engine fails to start. Production alt=A bald man with white hair around his ears. He is wearing a black suit, blue shirt, glasses and a red tie. The Parking Garage was written by Larry David, his fourth writing credit for the season and was directed by Tom Cherones, his fourth directing credit for the season. The episode was filmed on the normal Seinfeld soundstage. The audience bleachers, Jerry's apartment and the restaurant set were removed from the soundstage. Shooting was done from different angles so the entire set was shown. The stage was surrounded by mirrors to make the parking garage appear larger. Louis-Dreyfus and Seinfeld had their makeup redone between takes while lying on the ground because the shoot was so demanding. The end was scripted to have the gang drive off together, and the car failing to start at the end of the episode was an accident. Kramer actor Michael Richards continued to crank the car's ignition without success. It was decided that the car not starting was a much funnier ending, and it was kept in the episode as something else gone wrong. The other actors' natural reactions are visible as the car fails to start. Theme The episode follows the premise of the idea of Seinfeld as a \\"show about nothing\\".

The episode has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics with many saying it is better than \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\". Holly Ordway called the episode \\"another classic Seinfeld episode\\" and also stated \\"the characters spend the whole episode in the same place resulting in an episode that's both memorable and funny.\\" She also said it was better than second season's \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said \\"√Ä la Season Two's \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\", this program uses one commonplace setting for its comedy, and I think it works even better than its famed predecessor\\". =Critical response= Linda S. Ghent, Professor in the Department of Economics at Eastern Illinois University, discusses this episode in view of its economic themes, specifically those of common resources, thinking 'at the margin' and cost-benefit analysis. The common resource here is the garage itself: it is for the public, but it is not supposed to be used by the public as a bathroom. Jerry decides that the relief (benefit) of urinating will outweigh the risk (cost) of getting caught.

At Jerry's apartment, George calls a company in Beijing to order a cream for treating baldness. The people on the other side of the line don't speak English. Elaine stops by and Kramer starts making home videos in Jerry's apartment. He livens things up by introducing Elaine and George as the leads in a new pornographic film, and mock interviewing them. Playing along, Elaine says the sex scenes with George are authentic, arousing him. A Chinese delivery boy, Ping, delivers the take- out Kramer ordered. George convinces Ping to act as a translator between him and the Beijing company. George finds it hard to control his obsession with Elaine and confides in Jerry. When Jerry presses him to explain this sudden attraction, he eventually cracks and tells Jerry that Elaine left the message. She comes in later and tells her secret to Jerry, but Jerry says George already told him. George confesses his attraction to Elaine. She finds this news disturbing and then realizes that Jerry and Kramer have become attracted to her too. Freaked out, Elaine leaves Jerry's apartment. Once she is gone, the three fight to hear the tape again.

It is the ninth episode of the show's third season. It first aired on November 20, 1991. The episode was written by Peter Mehlman and was directed by Tom Cherones. Plot Kramer wants a jacket belonging to his mother's ex-boyfriend, as it supposedly has an attractive power over women. To get the jacket, he asks Elaine to impersonate the daughter of the owner. George thinks his girlfriend Audrey is perfect, except for one flaw: she has a large nose. During a conversation about beautiful women, Kramer bluntly tells her she needs a nose job. In outrage, Elaine refuses to help him with the jacket. Eager to see his girlfriend's one flaw corrected but afraid of appearing shallow, George first ascertains that Audrey was not offended by Kramer's suggestion and then delicately persuades her to get the nose job. The surgery is horrifically botched, and an appointment is made to fix the damage. George is so nauseated by her disfigured nose that he cannot look at her, and tries to lead her into taking a vacation by herself in the interim between surgeries. Audrey breaks up with him in response. Jerry is conflicted about his relationship with an actress named Isabel, who he finds sexually attractive, but dumb and irritating. He likens the conflict to a chess match between his brain and his penis. When she has him do a practice reading with her, delivering a scenery-chewing performance, Jerry decides he can endure no more and breaks up with her. After Kramer takes Audrey to the hospital, Elaine relents and goes with him to get the jacket. They fool the landlord and he gives them the jacket, but he inadvertently upsets Kramer when he insults Kramer's mother and Kramer attacks him. Audrey's nose is fixed, making her overall appearance radiantly beautiful. Kramer is seen with the jacket and goes out with Audrey.

It is the tenth episode of the show's third season. It first aired on November 27, 1991. The episode was originally produced for Season 2 but was postponed because Larry David was dissatisfied with the episode; it was therefore advertised as a \\"lost\\" episode. It was also released in the first and second season set instead of the third. The episode was written by Larry David, Jerry Seinfeld and Matt Goldman and was directed by Tom Cherones. Besides the usual cast, other actors in the episode include: Michael Chiklis, Bobbi Jo Lathan, Gwen Shepherd, and Marcia Firesten. Plot At a drug store, George has an altercation with the cashier (played by Gwen Shepherd), accusing her of short- changing him ten dollars. He is removed by the security guard. George is invited to a party on Long Island and brings Elaine and Jerry with him. Jerry and Elaine become trapped in boring conversations, and Elaine confronts a woman because of the morality of her fur coat. When a co-worker comes on to George, Jerry gives him permission to leave with her in his car, even though this strands Jerry and Elaine at the party. They call Kramer and ask him to pick them up, but he forgets the order of digits in the house number, leaving him no recourse but to try every permutation. He arrives long after all the other guests are gone. As a sign of gratitude for allowing him and Elaine to wait at their home, Jerry suggests the hosts, Steve (Michael Chiklis) and Jenny, stop by his apartment if they are ever in Manhattan. A week later, Steve takes him up on his offer just as Jerry is heading out the door. Jerry allows him to wait in the apartment until his return. Kramer stops by and he and Steve get drunk and bond. Eventually Steve hires a prostitute to come to Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George meet at the drug store where they speak about the coworker whom George slept with after the party. After Jerry picks a medicine, George puts it in his shirt under his jacket as retribution for the short-changing incident before. The security guard witnesses the attempted shoplifting and takes him to jail. Jerry returns home to find that the prostitute has provided Steve services in advance, and refuses to leave until paid. As Jerry is paying the girl off, cops arrive and he's arrested for fomenting prostitution. Elaine arrives and prepares to squabble with the prostitute over her fur coat. Later, Jerry and George fondly reminisce about their time in jail. Production The episode was originally produced for the second season. However, Larry David, dissatisfied with the episode, had the episode shelved until midway through season three. Its initial broadcast included a special introduction by Jerry to explain the continuity error of George still working in the real estate business.

The episode was the 11th episode of the show's third season. It aired on December 4, 1991. The episode was written by Larry David and Bill Masters; it was directed by Tom Cherones. The idea for the Woody Allen story came from David's experiences working with Allen; he briefly appeared in Radio Days (1987) and New York Stories (1989). He would later appear in a lead role in Whatever Works (2009). The episode repeatedly uses the line \\"these pretzels are making me thirsty,\\" one of the first popular lines to emerge from the show, which inspired fans to throw pretzels during Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up comedy performances during the few months following its premiere. In 2012, Jerry Seinfeld identified this as his least favorite episode, saying the stroke patient storyline made him feel uncomfortable.http://www.huliq.com/13303/jerry-seinfeld-reveals-his-least- favorite-seinfeld-episode Plot Jerry's car is stolen and he has a conversation with the thief (voiced by Larry David) on the car phone. Kramer asks for his gloves from the car thief. George takes a job moving cars from one side of the street to the other (covering Sid's shifts while he travels to visit his sick nephew) to comply with alternate side parking regulations. Elaine cares for her 66-year-old boyfriend, who has a stroke just before she is about to break up with him. Kramer gets a single line in a Woody Allen film, \\"These pretzels are making me thirsty.\\" Overwhelmed at his new job, George causes a car collision and traffic jam, making it take longer for the ambulance to reach Elaine's boyfriend, which causes additional neural damage that could have been prevented. Due to the delays caused by George, a disgruntled Woody Allen says that he may never shoot a movie in New York City ever again. Additionally, George's poor performance causes many of Sid's long time customers to cancel. This results in Sid being unable to finance his nephew's operation to save his foot, which must now be amputated. While filming his shot during the movie, Kramer slams down his beer mug on the bar and accidentally injures Allen with a flying shard of glass. He is fired from the set. Kramer gets the brown gloves from the car thief but has no information about the car, which irritates Jerry.  Critical reception  The New York Post listed the \\"pretzels\\" line as one of \\"Seinfeld's 25 greatest contributions to the English language.\\" An article about Elaine's boyfriends, meanwhile, suggests that in the context of Woody Allen films, \\"perhaps Elaine's strange relationship with Owen, a senior citizen at 66, can be explained as some kind of Manhattan reference.\\". Another article, while criticizing Elaine's relationship with an older man as inappropriate, argued that it \\"went with her characterization to be superficial enough to choose men like this.\\" References External links  Category:Seinfeld (season 3) episodes Category:1991 American television episodes ","title":"The Alternate Side"},{"id":"5072868","text":"Jamal (Hossein) Mirsadeghi () is an Iranian writer.

To repay her, he goes to the store and finds her a cashmere sweater that has a minor flaw, for which it was marked down considerably. After going back and forth for a short time George decides to go through with the purchase and the reasoning being that she will never even see the spot. Elaine is elated when given the sweater but Kramer bursts into Jerry's apartment and immediately points out the red dot. She quickly becomes furious at George and returns the sweater to him. Jerry inadvertently reintroduces Elaine's boyfriend Dick, a recovering alcoholic, to liquor.

Later, a drunk Dick heckles Jerry during one of his stand up comedy acts. While George is working at his new job, he becomes attracted to a cleaning lady named Evie and has sex with her after they both drink Hennigan's Scotch. The next day, Evie gets upset over what happened the previous night and threatens to report it to the boss of the company. George tries to compensate with her by offering the flawed cashmere sweater. Evie is overjoyed with the gift, launching into an emotional story about her first cashmere experience involving wealthy people visiting her village and her being in awe of their clothing which was of course cashmere. She then notices the red dot and goes through to tell Mr. Lippman , Elaine and George's Boss at this time.

Plot At a piano recital given by George's girlfriend Noel, Jerry teases Elaine by balancing his Tweety Bird Pez dispenser upright on her leg. This induces uncontrollable laughter in Elaine. Unnerved by the laughter, Noel makes an embarrassing flub, and afterwards tells George and his friends that the laughter has made her lose confidence in herself as a pianist. Elaine wants to apologize and explain, but George insists she remain silent for fear that Noel will break up with him if she learns Elaine was the one laughing. Kramer creates a cologne that smells of the beach, but when he tries to sell the idea to Calvin Klein, the representative says that the beach is an offensive smell, pointing out that people shower after going to the beach to rid themselves of its odor. Jerry hosts an intervention for an old friend, Richie Appel. Richie developed a drug addiction because he believed himself to be the cause of Marty Benson's death from pneumonia after Kramer told him to pour Gatorade on his head after winning a softball game. George is frustrated that he does not have the upper hand in the relationship, and fears Noel will break up with him. Acting on advice from Kramer, George preemptively breaks up with her, but she gives him the \\"hand\\" to persuade him to stay. At the intervention, Noel hears Elaine laughing, realizes George lied, and she breaks up with him. Richie agrees to enter rehab after seeing the Pez dispenser, which brings up a childhood memory and causes him to admit his drug problem. Richie does well in rehab, but is now addicted to Pez.

In the \\"extras\\" section of the Season 3 DVD, Jerry Seinfeld says it is his favorite episode. Upon its first airing, it was initially titled \\"The New Friend\\". Plot =Part 1= Jerry meets an idol of his‚Äîformer New York Mets baseball player Keith Hernandez (appearing as himself)‚Äîand wants to make a good impression. Meanwhile, George is out of time on his unemployment and he works harder than ever on his scheme to get a 13-week extension. He tells the unemployment office that he was close to a job with Vandelay Industries, a company made up by George that makes latex products and whose main office's phone number is Jerry's apartment. Kramer and Newman accuse Keith of spitting on them after a past Mets game by the players parking lot at Shea Stadium; however, Jerry supports a \\"second-spitter theory\\" in which Keith is not involved. Keith asks Jerry about Elaine's relationship status, then makes a date with her, breaking a date he previously made with Jerry. =Part 2= Having been busted by his unemployment officer after an out-of-the-loop Kramer answers Jerry's phone and informs her that the number is for a private apartment, George tries to curb losing his benefits by taking the officer's daughter (Carol Ann Susi) out for a date. She dumps George by the end of the second date, which causes him to express to Jerry his desire to date a tall woman. Meanwhile, Jerry becomes jealous that Keith is spending more of his time dating Elaine. Elaine ends the relationship because he smokes. When Keith asks Jerry to help him move his furniture, Jerry considers this too large a favor given how little time they've known each other and ends their friendship. Right then, Kramer and Newman confront Keith about the \\"spitting incident\\". Keith tell them the real spitter was Mets relief pitcher Roger McDowell. Kramer and Newman remember they had taunted McDowell throughout the game and the pair apologize to Keith, also offering to help move his furniture. George rushes in with one last desperate attempt to win over his unemployment officer by getting Keith to meet her, but he is too late. As he mopes, a tall woman appears with his wallet, which he had dropped on the sidewalk outside, causing George to give a happy smile. Production The \\"spitting incident\\" depicted in the story is a parody of the 1991 film JFK. Jerry presents the \\"magic loogie theory\\", a reference to the \\"magic bullet theory\\" featured in the film. The recount of the incident in the episode resembles the Zapruder film in JFK, as it uses the same color and photography effects. The episode features Wayne Knight (as Newman), who appeared in JFK in the same position as the scene it depicts. Originally, the script was written where the actual spitter was going to be Darryl Strawberry, but due to Strawberry having legal issues at the time of production, Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld believed that it wouldn't look good for Strawberry's image to be portrayed as spitting on fans, so Roger McDowell, a friend of Keith Hernandez, was written in Strawberry's place. An alternative ending was filmed where the tall woman gives George his wallet, and George thanks her then shows her the door. When she asks George if he wants anything else, George, after a pause, shakes his head \\"No\\" and closes the door on her. When Jerry looks at him in disbelief, George shrugs, \\"Not my type,\\" causing Jerry to roll his eyes in exasperation. Reception and legacy TV Guide ranked the episode fourth in their 1997 list of the 100 Greatest TV Episodes of All Time. On June 23, 2010, Jerry Seinfeld called four innings of a Mets game at Citi Field against the Detroit Tigers on SportsNet New York, reuniting him with Hernandez, now an analyst for SNY. During that time, he revealed that if Hernandez had turned them down they would have asked Gary Carter to take his place.

It aired on February 26, 1992. Plot Jerry flies in from Chicago and George arrives to take him home. His car has broken down on the Belt Parkway, stranding them at the airport. Jerry points out a limousine chauffeur with a sign saying \\"O'Brien\\". Jerry had seen an O'Brien in Chicago complaining to airport staff that he had to reach Madison Square Garden. Since O'Brien's flight is overbooked and he will not be arriving in New York soon, George suggests they pose as O'Brien and his colleague and take the limo home. George assumes the identity of O'Brien, and Jerry makes up the name Dylan Murphy. The chauffeur lets them into the limo and says he has the four passes. George remembers the Knicks are playing the Bulls that night at MSG. Excited at the prospect of seeing the game live, Jerry calls Elaine on the limo's phone and tells her to wait with Kramer for them to pick them up for the game, and to call him and George by their pseudonyms. The chauffeur stops to pick up a man, Tim (Peter Krause), and a woman, Eva (Suzanne Snyder), for whom two of the passes are evidently intended. Eva and Tim tell Jerry that they are great fans of O'Brien's newsletter and book, The Big Game, but have never met O'Brien or even seen a picture of him. Eva invites George to read over a faxed copy of the speech he is to deliver that night. It is full of remarks expounding antisemitism and white supremacy. A loud bang is heard outside. Tim pulls out a pistol and exits the car, but it is just a flat tire. Preparing for a real attack, Tim pulls out a briefcase of pistols. A news report reveals that Donald O'Brien, head of the regional chapter of the Aryan Union, a high-profile Neo-Nazi organization, is scheduled to make his first public appearance at the Paramount Theater, adjacent to MSG, to deliver the speech at a rally. Crowd control officers have lined up several barricades to keep away hordes of protesters. Kramer comments on how suspicious George and Jerry's meeting arrangements are. Kramer and Elaine run into her friend Dan and his friends, who tell them they are going to the rally to protest O'Brien. Since this is his first public appearance, none of them knows what he looks like. Kramer recognizes the name from Jerry's instructions, and suspects Jerry of leading a double life as Donald O'Brien. George and Jerry plan to have the limo drive back to the Upper West Side and get out when they see Elaine and Kramer. Protesters across the street spot them, forcing all four of them to retreat into the limo. As the protesters chase the limo down the street, the real O'Brien calls the limo to let them know of his delay. Tim and Eva draw their guns and demand an explanation. Jerry, George and Elaine nervously talk over each other as protesters surround the limo and begin rocking it. Exasperated, Eva orders them all out. Elaine and Dan meet again awkwardly while news teams identify a panicked George as O'Brien.

He is on the car phone with Elaine, who tells him he has to go after the driver. He does, but when the driver steps out he sees that she is a beautiful woman named Angela (played by Melinda McGraw) and decides to date her.

He tells Becky that he will do something about the damage. Meanwhile, Kramer has convulsions from Mary Hart's voice. George and Elaine go out to dinner with a married couple, Robin and Michael. Elaine makes up an elaborate story that she once dated a matador from Spain named Eduardo Corrochio.

Robin falls for George due to the incident, and they have an affair. As George and Robin are in bed together, Michael calls Elaine, wanting to speak to Robin. Not knowing that Robin used her as an alibi, Elaine tells him she isn't there, and Michael figures out Robin is with George. Jerry confronts Angela about Becky's car, but she threatens him with bodily harm should he tell anyone of her guilt. Elaine walks in on the exchange and realizes Jerry lied, only for Jerry to turn it around when he learns of Elaine‚Äôs lie about being married to a matador. Jerry goes to Becky's house to write out a check for her damages and then ask her out, but Becky assumes he is the hit-and-run driver, seeing no other reason why he might want to pay for the damages. George escapes from Michael by joining Jerry on his out of town gigs. Kramer uses the accident as an excuse to talk to Becky and gets a date with her.

Originally, she was an evil duplicate of Kara Zor-El created by red kryptonite in Adventure Comics #313 (1963). She attempted to kill Supergirl's fellow female Legionnaires so she could sustain her independent existence. Satan Girl reappears in Legionnaires #17 (Aug. 1994), as one of the time anomalies created by the events of Zero Hour. The storyline in Supergirl vol. 5, #3‚Äì6 (Dec. 2005‚ÄìMar. 2006) is inspired by the original Satan Girl story, with black kryptonite producing a duplicate \\"Dark Supergirl\\". Delores Pratchet Dolores Pratchet was the post-Crisis on Infinite Earths Satan Girl, appearing in Supergirl vol. 4, #40‚Äì41 (Jan‚ÄìFeb 2000). 200 years ago in colonial America (1776), Dolores Pratchet, a practitioner of Satanic rituals lost her daughter Rachel when the young girl tried to save her friend, a slave named Ember, from being burned at the stake for witchcraft. The two girls fused into one and became an Earth-Born Angel of Fire. However Ember began to fall from grace, dooming both her soul and Rachel's. Dolores made a deal with the demonic Carnivore and agreed to become his servant to save her daughter. He gave her magical powers and dubbed her Satan Girl. Satan Girl's magic was able to bridge time and pull the current Angel of Fire, Supergirl, from the present and switch her bodies with Ember, so that Supergirl would die on the stake, and Ember would exist in the future (along with Rachel). This disturbance of the timeline allowed Satan Girl to appear in the present with Ember. However Supergirl was able to escape her death with the aid of Ember, who returned to her own time to live out her fate, and a sorceress known as Tammy Neil. By setting the timeline right, Satan Girl crumbled to dust as she was not alive in the correct timeline. S'tanicule Gyrstress This Satan Girl is from another dimension and is referred to as the Brocian goddess of love and death. Brainiac 5 blasts an old Brocian statue dedicated to her with chronon energy, ripping space and time and allowing her to free herself. She unleashes a crimson plague that makes the world love her as she primes the world for her people to take over. Supergirl and Brainiac 5 channel the time energy that freed her to send her back and trap her. She appeared in Supergirl vol. 5, Annual #2 (2010). Her appearance is similar to Dolores Pratchet. Powers and abilities The first Satan Girl had all of Supergirl's powers; see powers and abilities of Superman. The second Satan Girl had various magical abilities, such as the power to cast spells and switch souls. Her trident fires blue flames that can burn through almost any substance and is strong enough to pierce invulnerable skin, such as Supergirl's.

The episode was the 20th of the third season. It aired on March 25, 1992. Plot Kramer poses for a portrait to be painted by Jerry's new girlfriend, Nina (Catherine Keener), which an elderly, art-loving couple (Elliott Reid and Justine Johnston) admire. George feels obligated to buy something when he accompanies Jerry to Nina's art studio, especially when she offers George her father's tickets to the owner's box at Yankee Stadium. George then reluctantly purchases a $500 painting, which he tries to sell to Jerry for $10 at the end of the episode. With Nina's tickets, George brings both Elaine and Kramer to the owner's box at Yankee Stadium. In order to get out of a prior engagement (her boss's son's bris), Elaine lies to her boss, Mr. Lippman, saying she must tend to her ill father. However, once the three are seated in the box, Elaine refuses to remove her Baltimore Orioles baseball cap and they are consequently evicted. Kramer, while attempting to climb over the dugout to retrieve George‚Äôs Yankee cap after Elaine threw it, is struck in the head by a baseball. At the same time, Nina and Jerry have an argument and break up. Upon returning to Jerry's apartment, Elaine discovers her confrontation in the Yankees' owners box was published with a picture in the sports section of the paper. After an unsuccessful attempt at stealing the sports section of the paper from her boss' office desk, Elaine fears her boss will recognize her picture and her lie about her father. Meanwhile, a poetic and emotional letter is delivered to Jerry's from Nina. Although he is initially moved and humbled, Jerry soon finds out that the letter was plagiarized from the Neil Simon film Chapter Two. While Jerry reinstates his breakup with Nina, the elderly couple who admired Kramer's portrait walk in to confirm their purchase. Elaine is summoned to her boss's office, whose accountant is revealed to be Nina's father. As he recites the baseball cap story over the phone, Lippman is amused and apparently does not realize that the offender was Elaine. He informs her that Nina's father has given him tickets to Yankee Stadium and invites her to wear a Baltimore cap (which she coincidentally has in her office) as a joke. In the closing scene, Jerry and George watch the televised Yankees game, only to find Elaine in yet another cap altercation as described by Phil Rizzuto and Kramer dines with the elderly couple who purchased his portrait. Popularity Both the oil painting of Kramer and the words the elderly couple use to describe it became popular among Seinfeld fans. Rob Thomas of the Wisconsin State Journal included the line \\"he is a loathsome, offensive brute, yet I can't look away\\" in his top 20 of Seinfeld lines.

The episode was the 22nd episode of the third season. It aired on April 22, 1992. The story of the parking confrontation was inspired by a similar incident that happened to writer Greg Daniels' father.Writing 'The Office': interview Greg Daniels and Mindy Kaling (NPR, November 2, 2006) Plot Kramer tells Jerry about his friend Mike calling Jerry a \\"phony\\". George and Elaine borrow Jerry's car to go to a flea market (much to Kramer's dismay as he wasn't invited). After getting into a minor accident, they notice that the car is starting to make a strange clanking noise. In order to soften Jerry's anger over the car damage, Elaine comes up with a wild story about their being pursued by a pack of teenagers with a gun. George and Elaine look for a parking space near Jerry's building so they can meet him at his apartment to watch a big televised boxing match. George spends a good deal of time positioning himself perfectly (bragging to Elaine about his ability to parallel park) to back into a space. Mike, also there for the fight at Jerry's, enters the same space, front first. The two argue over who is entitled to the space, all the while blocking traffic. Mike argues that he entered the space first, while George argues that he saw it first and that entering front first instead of using the prescribed parallel parking method is illegitimate. People walking by on the street witness the altercation and begin debating the merits of each side. A truck carrying a supply of ice-cream needs to get through, but the two cars are blocking his way, so the driver orders them to move the cars. George and Mike get neutral people to move the cars (since they don't trust each other to do so) and reposition them after the truck is past. Jerry and Kramer also come down to try to settle the problem. Jerry inadvertently tells a little boy named Matthew (John Christian Graas) that his father, who owns the \\"fat free\\" yogurt store, is closing the store, and the boy gets upset. Kramer mistakenly thinks the boy's mother is pregnant. George and Elaine apologize to Kramer for not inviting him to the flea market, but he rejects their apology. Two police officers arrive to resolve the parking situation. However, when one tells Mike to move his car, the other argues in support of him, and by now, it's nighttime. With George and Mike still arguing, Jerry runs back to his apartment, just in time to see the last few seconds of the count for knockout.

It is the 23rd, and final, episode of the third season and the first of a three-episode story arc. It first aired on May 6, 1992. Candice Bergen guest stars as herself, playing the title character from Murphy Brown (as she did in real life) in a TV episode within a TV episode. Plot In a montage of incidents, Jerry returns home only to find that Kramer has overstayed his welcome; he had been using the spare set of keys Jerry had left with him. Exasperated, Jerry demands his spare keys back. The loss of the keys makes Kramer first rueful and then philosophically resigned. Disturbed by the change in him, Jerry tries to give the keys back, but Kramer refuses. Kramer then takes off for California to follow his dream of becoming an actor, after he is unable to persuade George to join him. Jerry gives his spare keys to Elaine. Soon after, he desperately needs them and goes to Elaine's apartment with George (who has the spare keys to her place), to search for his spare set. While there, they find Elaine's writing project for an episode of Murphy Brown. As they read and laugh over it, Elaine walks in. Despite their positive assessment of her script, she screams at them to leave because they've invaded her privacy. Jerry is unable to locate Kramer to make amends. One night, while watching Murphy Brown with Elaine, Jerry sees Kramer in a bit part on Murphy Brown as Murphy's new secretary, \\"Steven Snell\\". Production Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld later appeared on Diane English's (creator of Murphy Brown) new show, Love & War, as a thank you for the Murphy Brown scene. Due to Julia Louis-Dreyfus's off- screen pregnancy, her character had to spend the latter half of this season hiding her belly behind furniture and laundry baskets. The Keys was the final episode filmed before the birth of her son and her leave at the start of Season 4. Music When Jerry calls Kramer's mother, the music heard in the background is from Pagliacci, which was later featured in the episode \\"The Opera\\". The scene that shows Kramer rollerskating in L.A. is accompanied by an instrumental version of The Beach Boys' song \\"California Girls\\".

It is the third episode of the fourth season. It aired on September 16, 1992. Plot NBC executives meet Jerry after his comedy act and ask him to come up with an idea for a TV series. George decides he can be a sitcom writer and comes up with the idea of it being \\"a show about nothing\\". Kramer trades Newman a radar detector for a helmet. Later Newman receives a speeding ticket due to the detector being defective. While waiting to meet the NBC executives, George and Jerry meet \\"Crazy\\" Joe Davola, a writer and \\"total nut\\" who goes to the same therapist (Stephen McHattie) as Elaine. Jerry, desperately searching for conversation, says he'll see him at a party Kramer will soon be having. When it becomes apparent that Joe knows nothing about it and was not invited, Jerry makes a hasty and unsuccessful attempt to backtrack. George becomes more and more nervous about the impending meeting. Jerry tries to calm him down by building him up. At the meeting, George argues with an unimpressed Russell Dalrymple about his proposed premise (no plot, no stories, nothing happens), defending his artistic integrity before storming out. In a last ditch attempt Jerry pitches Kramer's idea about running a circus. Jerry later blasts George for his actions and suggests he get help. George starts a relationship with one of the executives, Susan Ross. When George brings her to Jerry's apartment, Kramer drinks spoiled milk and vomits on her. Crazy Joe Davola, upset at not being invited to Kramer's party, attacks Kramer, kicking him in the head. However, Kramer was wearing Newman's helmet at the time, which saves him any visible injury. When Kramer tells Jerry this, he warns him that Davola says he is looking for Jerry as well. Production In syndication, this episode does not feature Jerry's stand-up routine and also uses Season 3's logo at the beginning, as is also the case in \\"The Ticket\\", \\"The Cheever Letters\\", and \\"The Virgin\\". Both this and \\"The Ticket\\" were originally broadcast as a one-hour episode, but are shown separately in syndication. The primary storyline about Jerry and George co-creating the show Jerry was a tongue-in-cheek homage to the process that Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David experienced when co-creating the show Seinfeld. In the Season 4 DVD extra documentary called \\"The Breakthrough Season\\", Jason Alexander and Castle Rock Entertainment executive Glenn Padnick discussed their initial skepticism about using this idea in not only one episode but as an arc for an entire season. Alexander found it to be \\"insane\\" and \\"self-aggrandized\\". Padnick described the arc about the Jerry show as \\"inside baseball on a show that most people didn't know even existed.\\" Critical reception Linda S. Ghent, Professor in the Department of Economics at Eastern Illinois University, discusses this episode in view of the asymmetric information dramatized. Ghent explains: \\"Millions of Americans\\" enjoyed the part of the episode in which Jerry makes a tele-caller see things from his perspective. The Pew Charitable Trusts weighed in on this episode, naming telemarketing one of the contributors to \\"rudeness in America\\".

Plot Continuing from \\"The Pitch\\", as a result of a blow on the head by Crazy Joe Davola, Kramer starts suffering from hemispatial neglect and possibly a concussion; He forgets to dress/shave half of his body properly, randomly says \\"Yo-Yo Ma\\", and starts spouting gibberish while talking on the phone. NBC gives Jerry and George another meeting about their idea for a pilot. On the way, Jerry throws out a watch his parents gave him, saying it is always running slow. He then meets his Uncle Leo, who picks the watch out of the garbage after Jerry and George leave. Kramer agrees to be an alibi for Newman's trial on a speeding ticket - Newman was simply racing home to stop Kramer, despondent over never becoming a banker, from committing suicide. Once in court, however, Kramer experiences short-term memory loss due to his head injury and completely forgets about their agreed-to alibi, causing Newman's case to crumble. George and Jerry meet with NBC executives and they give the go ahead for a pilot. Afterwards Jerry and George go to the coffee shop. While there, Jerry calls his manager to find out that NBC has offered them $13,000 for the pilot. George is insulted by this. He then glances out the window and thinks he sees Crazy Joe Davola outside. This makes Jerry and George afraid to leave the cafe. Jerry attempts to enlist the help of a policeman in getting out; however, the policeman orders a sandwich and refuses to escort them out until he has eaten. Elaine is in Europe with her therapist. He realizes that he did not leave an extra prescription for Joe for the time while he would be on vacation, thus explaining Joe's imbalanced behavior.
