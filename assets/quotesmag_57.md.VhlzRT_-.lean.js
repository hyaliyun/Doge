The series received generally positive reviews from comic critics.

Both characters come from the Southern United States and speak in over-the-top accents and slang. The series was first announced in October 2017 at the New York Comic Con. Although both characters had previously been featured in self-titled comic series individually, this is the first miniseries starring them together. The five-issue limited series was written by Kelly Thompson with art by Pere Perez and covers by Kris Anka. Thompson considers herself a \\"little bit of an expert\\" on Rogue and Gambit and relied on editor Darren Shan to tell her when her writing was too steep in old continuity for newer readers to follow.Richards, Dave (January 3, 2018), \\"How Rogue & Gambit Will Confront Their Pasts & Future Together page 2,\\" Comic Book Resources.

They discover the resort is managed by the villain Lavish, who is taking mutant visitors captive and replacing them with robot duplicates.

Oil on canvas; 163 cm (64 in) x 244 cm (96 in). Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. 1997.28 Prometheus Bound is an 1847 oil painting by American artist Thomas Cole. Prometheus Bound is one of Cole's largest paintings, and like his other major works of the 1840s it was not the result of a commission. It draws from the ancient Greek tragedy Prometheus Bound by Aeschylus. In the painting, Prometheus is chained to a rock on Mount Caucasus in Scythia. Zeus has punished him for endowing humans with life, knowledge, and specifically for giving humans fire. Each day a raptor comes to feed on Prometheus's liver, which regrows between visits, making Zeus's punishment even more cruel. The allegorical painting is among Cole's last works, but Cole never commented on the theme of the work. Art historians have tentatively linked the bondage of Prometheus to abolitionist sentiment by reviewing the presentation of the mythical figure in contemporaneous literature. Cole sent it to London for an 1847 exhibit and competition to decorate the Houses of Parliament, and the painting was still in London when he died. It thus received little exhibition in the United States in the 1840s, making its reception (and its theme) difficult to judge. Description Cole was a landscape painter who often employed allegory in his works, such as The Titan's Goblet and The Voyage of Life. The story of Prometheus strictly belongs to the genre of history painting. In Prometheus Bound, the landscape is appropriately desolate; above Prometheus are imposing, snowy mountains and a cold sky. The figure himself blends in with the rocks, a conscious decision of the artist that adds an element of surprise for the viewer when the figure is finally seen; the viewer's surprise emphasizes Prometheus's desperate and desolate situation.Junker, 34 Upon further inspection a vulture is seen lower in the painting, swooping up toward Prometheus. The raptor comes at dawn, when the planet Jupiter (the \\"morning star\\") is seen in the sky. Cole wrote, \\"The Artist has supposed the time [to] be the dawn of day. Jupiter the Morning Star\\" in a note for an exhibition. As the Roman god Jupiter is the equivalent of Zeus, Prometheus's antagonist symbolically watches over him. Technically, the rendition of light on snow is very skilled; Cole used a red underpaint with white to render the mountains. The famous American landscape artist Frederic Edwin Church wrote in 1876 to Cole's son, \\"I've always admired greatly the sky of that picture, deeming it the finest morning effect I ever saw painted\\".Quoted in Junker, 37 Interpretation There is no record of Cole commenting on the theme of Prometheus Bound. Art historian Patricia Junker notes that writers and artists often took up the myth of Prometheus in the decades before Cole's painting; they include Lord Byron, James Gates Percival, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, James Russell Lowell, Henry David Thoreau, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Prometheus in bondage was seen as having an \\"indomitable spirit\\" and could \\"serve as a potent object lesson for political and social reform\\".Junker, 49 Thoreau had recently translated Aeschylus's play, noting in his forward the increasing interest in Prometheus. Percival published an anti-slavery poem called \\"Prometheus\\" in 1843, a time when slavery and abolitionism were controversial topics in the U.S. It is possible that Cole used the bondage of Prometheus as a comment on slavery, as he saw art as a potential moral influence on society.Junker (2000) and Exhibition and early reception Painted toward the end of Cole's life, Prometheus Bound followed a period in which Cole worked on his ambitious but never-finished painting series The Cross and the World. In this five-part series he had intended to contrast two travellers as they set out from the central image, one on a spiritual and the other a worldly journey. Beginning in February 1846, Cole abandoned that project and developed sketches and studies over the next fifteen months for Prometheus Bound. The 1840s saw Cole developing larger, monumental canvases. Confident in his work and not limited in subject by commissions, he conceived his larger paintings as exhibition works. Cole submitted Prometheus Bound to the 1847 exhibition at Westminster Hall, London, the third in a series of competitions to select art for the British Houses of Parliament. The competition offered cash prizes, the possibility of a fresco commission, and the chance for recognition in the press through reproductions in the Illustrated London News and lithographs by print publishers. However, the painting's subject matter was a poor fit, as the exhibit required any allegorical paintings to relate to the history of Great Britain; and during the exhibition it was \\"skied\\"‚Äîplaced very highly on the wall where viewers might not have seen the details. The painting did not win a prize and received little press attention. To gauge public response, Cole first showed the work at the New-York Gallery of Fine Arts along with the collection of his one-time patron Luman Reed. It was well received; the Literary World wrote, \\"The whole composition produces in the mind of the spectator a feeling of utter loneliness and desertion; which was, unquestionably, the artist's aim. The star of Jupiter is seen above, hovering within sight of his victim, and one feels, in looking at him, as if he were placed there for all time to gloat on the agonies of the tortured Prometheus.... We wish Mr. Cole could find it in his heart and in his way to treat us oftener to his imaginative creations. They give a dignity to art which the mass of modern artists do not seem to appreciate\\".Quoted in Junker, 44 Cole's early biographer, Louis Legrand Noble, commented on the painting: Charles Lanman included Prometheus Bound in his The Epic Paintings of Thomas Cole (1848), praising it as \\"one of the wildest and most splendid efforts of the painter's pencil ... one of the most truly sublime paintings we have ever seen\\".

He was one of the first African- American military aviators in the United States Army Air Corps, the United States Army Air Forces and later the United States Air Force. Lester was one of two pilots who shot down three Focke-Wulf Fw 190 or Messerschmitt Bf 109 on a single mission; the other pilot was Captain Joseph Elsberry. Lester flew a P-51 Mustang nicknamed \\"Miss Pelt.\\" World War II The Tuskegee Airmen is the popular name of a group of African-American military pilots (fighter and bomber) who fought in World War II. They formed the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces. The name also applies to the navigators, bombardiers, mechanics, instructors, crew chiefs, nurses, cooks and other support personnel. Lester recalls that \\"Being a black pilot in the 1940s was like being a pro athlete today ... We knew we were special, that we would have to prove something. This was the first chance blacks had had outside of working in the kitchen or the possiblity [sic] of being a truck driver.\\" White pilots would fly around 50 combat missions but because there were no replacements, black pilots of the Tuskegee Airmen flew around 70 missions. During the war he flew over 90 combat missions. After the WWII While flying an F-84E Thunderjet it experienced mechanical failure and exploded into flames forcing Lester to yank his ejection seat and parachute from the inflamed jet, which made him \\"only the sixth pilot ever to use the ejection method.\\" Later in his career he also worked with the infamous \\"Whiz kids\\" that Robert McNamara assembled at the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In 1969 Lester retired as a full colonel and was then appointed as associate director of social services in Rockville, Maryland.

In some cases surgical amputation is performed to remove the duplicate carpals, metacarpals and phalanges. As of 2015, approximately 70 cases have been recorded in the medical literature. Bone deformity may also accompany nervous and arterial anomalies in some cases due to the duplication of the ulnar nerve, the presence of abnormal arterial arches, the duplication of the ulnar artery, the shortening of the radial nerve, and the absence of the radial artery. The diagnosis of ulnar dimelia is based on laboratory tests of frontal and sagittal planes in individuals suspected of the condition. There are two types of ulnar dimelia noted in medical journals: Type 1 ulnar dimelia entails one lunate and one trapezoid bone as well as one index finger, while type 2 ulnar dimelia has two lunate and two trapezoid bones as well as two index fingers.

It is a common species, found in southern Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and south to Central America. Ammophila procera generally live in open areas with soft or sandy soil where they can burrow nests. The adult female digs a burrow. After completing the burrow, it seals the entrance and makes flight around the area, memorizing landmarks such as rocks, plants, etc. It uses these landmarks to locate the burrow when it returns, sometimes days later. It then captures and paralyzes prey, usually a moth caterpillar or sawfly larva, and drags it to the burrows where it lays a single egg on the prey. The female then seals the nest with dirt and debris. Despite sealing the nest, some females will \\"hijack\\" another's nest, replacing the egg in the nest with their own. The egg typically hatches after two days, and the larva feeds on the caterpillar for about five days before it pupates within the nest. It emerges from the nest with fully formed wings. The adults feed primarily on flower nectar.

It was commissioned in 1953 to depict the history of Philippine medicine. It is currently on display in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Manila.  The painting  In 1953, Dr. Agerico Sison, then director of Philippine General Hospital, and Dr. Eduardo Quisumbing, director of the National Museum, Dr. Florentino Herrera Jr., and Dr. Constantino Manahan commissioned Botong Francisco to create a painting depicting the history of Philippine medicine. The painting consists of four oil-on-canvas panels depicting medical practice in the Philippines in four historical eras. They were displayed at the lobby of the Philippine General Hospital for 58 years until their permanent relocation to the Museum Foundation of the Philippines Hall at the National Museum of the Philippines on 27 July 2011.  Restorations  Tomas Bernardo restored the panels in 1974 and 1991. Its 2006 restoration was under Orlando Abinion‚Äôs supervision and was funded by the US Department of State‚Äôs Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation. Abinion's team worked on the restoration in 2006 and 2007, with conservation treatment activities including solubility testing, facing and consolidation of paint layers, cleaning of surfaces and removal of old lining and re-lining, removal of facing, surface dirt and old varnish, grafting of holes and leveling lacunae, and preliminary and final retouching. The restored works are on indefinite loan from the University of the Philippines, PGH‚Äôs principal, and are on permanent exhibit in the National Museum of Fine Arts. In exchange, the museum hung two reproductions created by photographer Benigno T. Tod III of the same size on the two sides of the PGH lobby. Cultural significance On 21 September 2011, the four-panel painting was declared a national treasure for being an ‚Äúirreplaceable part of the institutional heritage of the Philippine General Hospital and the University of the Philippines, and of the cultural heritage of the nation.\\"  References   External links  *Carlos V.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, they were commonly used for piracy by the Banguingui and Iranun people against unarmed trading ships and raids on coastal settlements in the regions surrounding the Sulu Sea. History Garay illustrations by Rafael Monle√≥n (1890) Most garay were built in the shipyards of Parang, Sulu in the late 18th century. During the early 19th century, Banguingui garay squadrons regularly plagued the straits of southern Palawan from the months of March to November each year. They raided coastal areas in northern Borneo for slaves as well as cut off trade into the Sultanate of Brunei. These attacks severely affected the economy of Brunei, leading to its decline. The Banguingui purportedly had a saying: \\"It is difficult to catch fish, but easy to catch Borneans.\\" Description Garay were smaller, faster, and more maneuverable than the Iranun lanong warships. They had a much broader beam and a somewhat round hull with a shallow draft. They had a single tripod main-mast made of three bamboo poles, which was rigged with a large rectangular sail with tilted upper corners (a layar tanja). They also had a foremast and sometimes a mizzenmast, which were rigged with smaller triangular crab claw sails. When the wind was heavy, the mainsail was lowered and only the foresail and the mizzen sails were set. They were also propelled by oars. Large garay could have around 30 to 60 oars, usually arranged into two banks, one on top of the other. They were rowed by either people belonging to the alipin caste, or by captured slaves. The hull was partially or fully decked. The deck was made of split bamboo slats, divided into square sections that could be removed as required. Most of the length of the ship was covered by a house-like structure roofed with nipa leaves. A raised platform over a clay stove was used for cooking. At the sides of the hull were overhanging catwalks, about in width. The ship did not have a central rudder, but had two steering oars located near the stern. The largest garay were around long and could carry up to 80 men, but most garay averaged at with around 60 men. Even smaller garay also existed with an average crew (sakay) of 25 to 30 men. Large garay can serve as motherships to smaller salisipan (a covered banca, shielded against arrows and spears), which could carry an additional 15 people. Garay were led by a nakura or nakuda (commander) who in turn is led by a squadron leader, the panglima. The julmuri (first mate) is in charge of the crew and also controls the rudder (bausan). Another officer, the julbato stays at the prow of the ship and watches out for reefs and enemy ships. The julbato is also in charge of the anchor (sao). Garay did not possess outriggers (unlike the lanong and other karakoa warships). Despite this fact, garay were commonly incorrectly referred to as prahu or proa (both outrigger vessels) in historical records. However, the projecting catwalks can function as a sort of outrigger in instances where the hull was flooded, keeping the ship afloat. In Malay, Javanese, and Portuguese sources, garay are also sometimes (incorrectly) referred to as penjajap. This term, however, referred specifically to penjajap (mangaio in Iranun), very long and narrow warships used mostly in Nusantara. They differed from garay in the width of their beams (penjajap were extremely narrow), and the fact that large penjajap usually had outriggers and two layar tanja sails. Garay were also sometimes referred to generically as panco (bangka). Role Garay were lightly-armed, in comparison to the lanong. They usually only had a single large cannon (lela). While the lanong specialized in ship-to-ship combat, the garay was more suited to raiding coastal villages and attacking unarmed or lightly armed trade ships.

They were typically very long and narrow, and were very fast. They are mentioned as being used by native fleets in Indonesia, the southern Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei. Names and etymology The original name for the ships among the natives of the Maluku Islands, eastern Sabah, western Mindanao, and the Sulu Archipelago is pangayaw or mangayaw (literally meaning \\"raider\\"). This was transcribed in European sources (chiefly Dutch and Portuguese) variously as pangaio, pangaia, panguaye, pangajao, pangajaua, pangajava, penjajab, penjajap, pindjajap, penjelajah, and pangara. The British East India Company explorer Thomas Forrest also records that the Iranun called them mangaio. The terms (particularly pangaio) were also later borrowed and used generically for any native wooden sailing ships made from planks without using nails by the Portuguese Empire in their colonies in Africa and India. This usage later spread to other European colonial powers, being applied chiefly to Arab and Swahili-built ships. The terms are similarly inaccurately applied to the garay, fast raiding vessels of the Banguingui and Iranun people in the Philippines. However, the garay were much broader and did not have outriggers. Penjajap may also be generically referred to as prao, prahu, proe, prauw, or prow in historical records. The \\"List of Ships and Sea Vehicles from East Indies\\" which is periodically published by colonial government of Dutch East Indies, registered pangajaoa as pengajoehan (pengayuhan). The list records its name came from kajoeh (kayuh - means paddle) and pengajoeh (pengayuh - means paddler), and consider it as a kind of galley.Bruyn Kops, G.F. De 1921. 'Vaartuigen'. In: Stibbe, D.G. & Spat, C. (eds.) Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch-Indi√´. ‚Äòs-Gravenhage: Nijhoff. p.485. History The earliest record of penjajap is from 1509 by the Portuguese historian Fern√£o Lopes de Castanheda, he said that pangajava (penjajap) were vessels from Sumatra, long and swift, going very well under sail or oars. In 1775, the British explorer Thomas Forrest described a large penjajap in an Iranun harbor in Sulu as being only wide and deep, but was as long as . It mounted six brass lantaka and carried a crew of thirty men. Admiral Fran√ßois-Edmond P√¢ris observed penjajaps during his voyage aboard the ship Favorite. The dimensions of the vessels encountered vary widely, the largest he saw were 17 meters long, 3,4 m wide and 2,1 m deep; the smallest was 11 m long. Herbert Warington Smyth reported the description of penjajap from Malay peninsula at the end of the 19th century. The boats were using dipping lugsail, with small deckhouse or awning (called kajang in Malay) and overhanging stern gallery (called dandan). Description Penjajap were made from light materials. They were typically very long and narrow and had a shallow draft. This allowed them to sail over dangerous reefs as well as upriver. Large penjajap had outriggers, without which, they would capsize. Penjajap has sharp stern but with an overhanging gallery. Deckhouse amidships is made of palm leaves with thatched roof. In the 19th century they are steered using centerline rudder of western design, but early penjajap may have used double quarter rudder. They have 1, 2, or 3 masts depending on the size, the quadrilateral sail has yard and boom. Long narrow oars are also used for propulsion. The name \\"Pagar Tenggalong\\" refers to a type of penjajap with ornamental bulwark/rail. Small penjajap carried one to two lantaka supported on posts at the bow, while larger ones had additional guns mounted at the sides. They were propelled by oars and usually by two tanja sails (called saguran among Sulu pirates). They could be rowed both forwards and backwards. They had a relatively open deck covered by a platform. A small cabin is located at the back, which served as the quarters of the nakodah and as a magazine for arms. Like the larger and broader garay, they also served as motherships to smaller kakap war-boats. Penjajap were very fast. Large penjajap could reach speeds of under sail, and when rowed. In Iranun raiding fleets, they usually outpaced the slower lanong warships.  Role  Penjajap were chiefly used as inter-insular warships and as pirate ships. Iranun penjajap were usually lightly armed compared to the lanong. Usually they only mount a single lela (native cannon). While lanong was specially designed for ship-to-ship combat, penjajap is more suited to raid coastal villages and attack lightly armed or unarmed merchant ships. In such raids, penjajap were usually accompanied by smaller boats called kakap, which are used as scouts for the penjajap or lanong. The Portuguese diplomat Tom√© Pires, on his visit to Nusantara, referred the penjajap as cargo vessels. Many cargo penjajap were collected by Pati Unus from various port cities in Java to attack the Portuguese in Malacca. Penjajap were converted to serve as armed troop transports for landing, as the Javanese junks were too large to approach shore. Penjajap was the other type of vessels counted by Pires after junks and lancaran upon arriving at a port. However Pires said that after the boats were donated to Pati Unus, trading activity in the ports became more lethargic. Admiral Fran√ßois-Edmond P√¢ris noted several cargo penjajap in Malacca strait during 1830s. The penjajap brought spices, dried areca nuts, and coconut almonds from Sumatra, and seem to frequent only the southern part of the strait.

She was declared a Hero of the Soviet Union on 1 July 1958 by decree of the Supreme Soviet.  Early life  Zenkova was born on 22 December 1923 to a Belarussian peasant family in Ushaly village, located within the present-day Shumilina District in the Vitebsk Oblast of Belarus. After completing secondary school she attended a vocational school before working as a seamstress at a garment factory in Vitebsk. She later began studying at the local Technical Clothing School but the school building was bombed by the German Air Force on the day of the students' evaluations.  World War II activities  After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941 Zenkova initially worked in civil defense activities, rescuing people from collapsed buildings and removing unexploded ordnances from streets and rooftops. When the city was surrounded by enemy forces she did not leave immediately as she was helping other people with the evacuation. When she tried to escape the city for Soviet-controlled territory she was detained by the Germans but managed to escape their custody. She then ran away on a week-long journey to the small village where she was born. Not long after arriving in her hometown of Ushaly, German forces took control of the area and began seizing the villagers' property, especially food and livestock. While she wanted to join the ranks of the partisan detachment named after Kliment Voroshilov, which her brother was a member of, but in March 1942 she was asked by the detachment's commissar to form a Komsomol cell near the strategically important railroad junction in Obol, five kilometers away from Ushaly to provide them with information on German military activities in the area. Zenkova agreed and the commissar gave her a list of people to recruit and leaflets to spread among them. With herself being only 18 years old at the time of forming the organization as well as many of the new recruits being even younger teenagers, with the youngest member being only 15, the group came to be known as the \\"Young Avengers\\". In August 1943 one of the group's members, 17-year-old Zinaida Portnova, managed to get a job working at the kitchen of a German mess hall, and subsequently poisoned the soup that was being prepared, killing dozens of enemy soldiers. In order to better monitor activities at the Obol railroad junction Zenkova got a job working as an assistant to an accountant at the station and another partisan, Nikolai Alekseyev, found work as the station switchman. When Alekseyev found a shipment of tanks in one of the trains he quickly transferred the information up the chain of command to Moscow, and the Soviet Air Force sent out bombers to destroy the shipment. The partisans themselves also directly engaged in arms stockpiling and sabotage, causing the collision of a train full of SS men with a resupply train. When Zenkova was provided with magnetic mines she found creative ways to hide them for delivery, even baking one info a loaf of bread to avoid detection. One mine she had given to a partisan was placed under the car of a high-ranking SS official, and ended up killing him and three other SS members in the car. They also blew up a power plant, a brick factory, a pumping station, a flax processing factory, and mined a highway in addition to removing pieces of train-track at vital areas. After the group was betrayed to the Germans by a member, mass arrests ensued; Zenkova survived because she had been away in Polotsk at the time the arrests began. When she began returned from Polotsk, Arkady Barbashov warned her of what was happening and the two managed to escape to joined the V.I. Lenin Sirotinsk Partisan Brigade. Because the Germans could not find Zenkova they arrested her mother Marfa instead and executed her in her daughter's place as a form of collective punishment.  Later life  After the war Zenkova raised the three children of a relative who had died in the war and became a member of the Communist Party in 1945. As an instructor in the District Komosmol Committee Zenkova assisted in the reconstruction of the city that had been badly damaged during the war. In 1967 she changed jobs and worked at the city military recruitment center. She was a popular public speaker, speaking at factories, schools, and military units. In 1958 she was declared a Hero of the Soviet Union and in 1976 declared an Honorary Citizen of Vitebsk. With her health deteriorating she died in 1984 at the age of 60 and was buried in the Mazurin Cemetery of Vitebsk.

Jones and Mark Elias  Plot  Charles Drake, maker of C-grade low-budget exploitation films, has brought on neophyte director Ed Smith for his latest bit of twaddle, \\"Curse of the Killer\\", based on an unfinished script penned by Ed himself. Ed fancies this opportunity as his big break, though he is alone in this belief as most everyone else involved with the meandering project sees it for what it is. Everything turns a darker shade of weird when people involved with the production start getting gruesomely killed off one by one. Charles, who has a history of dealing with nefarious characters, suspects the person responsible for the body count is a mob boss who is funding the film, but no one knows for sure. In the end, will there be anyone left to complete the film, or will the prophesy in the script \\"Curse of the Killer\\" turn into a reality?  Release  The film premiered in 2006 at the Milan International Film Festival (MIFF) and was distributed by Anthem Pictures. In 2010 the film was renamed \\"Wide Scream\\" for its Australian release.

These experiences are evident in multiple sensory modalities and include deviation in all facets of thought, cognition, and emotion. Compared to other psychological disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), schizophrenia has significantly higher heritability. It has been found to present cross-culturally, and it almost always has 0.1% prevalence in a given population, although some studies have cast doubts on this. Schizophrenia has been hypothesized to be unique to human beings and existing for a long time. Schizophrenia has raised a perplexing question for evolutionary psychologists and anthropologists. Why has such a debilitating disorder persisted for so long, with such frequency? This paradox has been referred to as the schizophrenia enigma, and many evolutionary models have been created to explain it. Evolutionary approaches reflect on how human genes can change over time. Under evolutionary pressures, certain phenotypes are favored, and this selection influences the frequency of genes that control these phenotypes. Evolutionary approaches have been used to try to explain the schizophrenia enigma. Widely accepted views see schizophrenia as a disadvantageous byproduct of human evolution and schizophrenia as an evolutionarily beneficial.  Main explanations  There are several evolutionary theories related to schizophrenia spanning time from when Homo erectus gained control of fire onward to the modern day. The first theory related to schizophrenia is Byproduct theories, which are a specific type of theory put forward by various scientists. These theories portray the disorder as a consequence of other, separate evolutionary changes. One anthropologist putting forward this theory, Crow, states that schizophrenia is a result from incomplete hemispheric specialization due to selection of genes relating to language. While another scientist, Burns, follows that schizophrenia is related to modified cortical connectivity which is vital for the development of the 'social brain. Finally Horrobin argues that ancient mutations are what developed linguistic, creative and shamanic ability which in turn can potentially cause deficits in lipid metabolism or as it is termed in modern times Schizophrenia. Another evolutionary theory which connects with the development of modern-day schizophrenia are Balance theories which hypothesizes that schizophrenia's negative aspects are balanced by benefits. These benefits yield valued personality traits or yet again shamanism a desired and mystic ability of the past. Though an evolutionary theory in its own, analysis of balance theory does not show this route as a possibility. Folklore accounts mention wise fools and clever madmen but do not connect such a characteristic to motifs combining psychosis and creativity, aspects believed to be borne from schizophrenia. A third theory relating to schizophrenia is group selection theory which describes 'psychosis' alleles provide advantages to groups, outweighing any disadvantages. This theory then goes further and states that as a result of this grouping, humans that have specific genes replaced groups that lacked those genes. Additionally, this theory uses elements based on byproduct theories and balance theories. Environmental change theories also rely on schizophrenia-type alleles providing more benefits to our ancestors than to our modern selves. Some who support this theory say that it was modernization which actually generated the disorder itself. While the environmental change theory does explain how the development of schizophrenia survived through to modern times this claim as a whole through historical, anthropological and clinical perspectives the theory has been deemed inconclusive. Random process theories are another explanation of Schizophrenia. At the center of this idea a polygenic mutation-selection balance theory describes mental disorders as continuous mutational effects on many genes underlying human behavior overtime. This description of all mental disorders, including schizophrenia, implies that when mutations disrupt cognitive processes during evolutionary stages, the functions connected to that process are also affected by those mutations in later eras. This theory not only supplies how mental illness survived through to modern times but also how mental processes are affected as a whole by way of this theory. Additionally, this process theory gives mental disorders a kind of watershed quality where there are varying layers within mental processes that flows to 'downstream' processes which would also be affected by disruptions in cognitive functions 'upstream.' Other hypotheses relating to schizophrenia include the idea that those with the disorder themselves possess some kind of 'physiological advantage' which includes resistance to injuries, resistance to various infections, enhanced healing abilities and even being less accident prone. These hypotheses are not well supported as any advantages possessed by those with schizophrenia should be found in their behavior not the genotype and the fact of the matter is that selection works on phenotype not genotype. Another suggested hypothesis, the stress-induced neurodevelopment hypothesis, claims that those exposed to pre- and/or early neonatal environmental stress may have developed psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MMD). The theory goes on further to explain that these disorders, spurred by stress before and after birth may have evolved and remained in the human genotype as a means of survival against adverse environments.  Schizophrenia as a byproduct of human evolution  The disadvantageous-byproduct view hypothesizes that schizophrenia started to occur when humans diverged from primates. According to this view, schizophrenia symptoms are extreme versions of normal social behaviors. Symptoms of schizophrenia such as delusions are extreme versions of cognitive processes that can be greatly beneficial. Such symptoms that are at the undesirable extreme of normality, however, result in more harm than benefit. Timothy Crow hypothesizes that schizophrenia is closely related to human language development. This hypothesis is mainly supported by the significant language dysfunction that shows up in schizophrenics. Another related model argues that schizophrenia results from certain inabilities to buffer the deleterious effects of mutations. This model of developmental instability is compatible with the diathesis‚Äìstress model. For those who view that schizophrenia and other frontal lobe disorders are connected to delayed cerebral maturation, this pathophysiological model explains schizophrenia as one unwanted extreme of normal variation.  Schizophrenia as advantageous to individual, kin, and group  Contrary to the previous view, there are models rooted in theories that view schizophrenia as granting beneficial powers to patients, their kin, or their social groups. This view attempts to explain the prevalence and persistence of schizophrenia over time and across cultures. Researchers, Joseph Polimeni and Jeffrey Reiss, argue that the existence of schizophrenia in humans is not random, basing this argument on the fact that the 1% prevalence rate is higher than gene mutation rates. This view displays benefits that promote the fitness of individuals, kins, or groups and thus enhance chance of survival, in reference to Charles Darwin's argument of natural selection and the \\"survival of the fittest\\" in his book, On the Origin of Species. Moreover, the evolutionary advantages mainly focus on the individual. The benefits of schizophrenia are likely to buffer the deficits of the disorder and thus balance the selective pressures. = Benefits to individuals = In 1964, Julian Huxley, Ernst Mayr, Humphry Osmond and Abram Hoffer theorized the first representation of the evolutionary aspects of schizophrenia. According to their complete research, they hypothesized that schizophrenia represented a genetic polymorphism with both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics. Moreover, the authors inferred that reduced fertility in schizophrenic patients was because of higher resistance to harmful factors, including shock, allergies, and infection. However, this view has not been substantiated. In addition, the schizophrenia paradox is classified by the inconsistency between higher rates of schizophrenia and reduced fertility. From an evolutionary standpoint, the rates of schizophrenia surpass common mutation due to the fact that it maintains the genotype. Moreover, according to VL Nimgaonkar's argument of the fertility of schizophrenic patients, men specifically have malfunctions in their reproductive systems. Not every hypotheses agrees with the schizophrenia paradox, however, most evolutionary perspectives do concur with the inconsistency between the higher rates of schizophrenia and reduced fertility in patients. Another related model suggests that certain traits in schizophrenia, including the tolerance of low levels of stimulation while being attentive, may have helped with developing territorial instincts, thus becoming advantageous to humans. However, Kellett fails to take into consideration all significant aspects of schizophrenia, including an evolutionary perspective of the different life-altering symptoms. Thus, referring to the social structure of Homo sapiens, hierarchical structures are of more importance in human societies than territorial ones. = Benefits to kin = More researchers support the idea that schizophrenia brings evolutionary benefits to kin by enhancing their physiological and psychological adaptiveness. In their scholarly journal, Robert Kuttner, Albert Lorincz, and Donald Swan argued that the favorable features of schizophrenia were of different social behaviors. They focused on the genetics of balanced polymorphism to theorize the prevalence of schizophrenia. For example, referring to the sickle cell anemia model, the deleted phenotypes do persist if the heterozygote has an advantage over its associated homozygotes. Thus, researchers hypothesize schizophrenia to be a homozygotic condition, and that asymptomatic heterozygotes are favored over average people. Individuals with active symptoms of schizophrenia are more likely to seclude themselves from others, avoiding circumstances that may lead to excess amounts of stress or anxiety. Based on conducted research, the authors theorized that there was not enough evidence to fully support that relatives of individuals with schizophrenia exhibited effective social adaptation. In addition, although the balanced polymorphism argument does not fully explain social behavioral characteristics, there are examples, such as sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs disease, and cystic fibrosis, that theorize the infectious agents. Furthermore, one study in favor of this beneficial-to-kin model argues that female children of patients with schizophrenia have enhanced survival rates. However, male individuals did not receive any advantages or disadvantages from this model. Further research also conveyed that there was no survival advantages for children whose parents were experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia. Similarly, Carter and Watts' study theorized a possible physiologic advantage of schizophrenia, that conveyed a decreased prevalence of virus infections among relatives of schizophrenic patients. The perceived connection between the mental illness and this advantage is possibly due to the genes associated with schizophrenia. However, criticism points to the failure to replicate such results. This view of schizophrenia being advantageous partially corresponds to the public fantasy of mentally ill patients being tormented geniuses. In support of this, superior academic success among relatives of schizophrenic patients has been found. This suggests possible adaptive benefits. Criticism of this model mainly addresses the lack of evidence to suggest a creativity‚Äìmental illness linkage. = Benefits to groups = shows the idea there cannot be rights without responsibility or a social group for an individual to work with. Schizophrenics are often overtly social and typically work outside the status quo, creating uncertainty within socio-individual relationships Anthony Stevens and John Price theorize the notion of the group-splitting hypothesis of schizophrenia, that all groups must split to maintain their cohesive structure. Many hypotheses connect schizophrenic symptoms to the characteristics seen in religious or spiritual leaders, such as Adolph Hitler or the Joan of Arc. Polimeni and Reiss' group selection hypothesis of schizophrenia emphasizes the shamanism, or shaman-like behaviors, arguing that there is a need to consider the genetic root of such behaviors. One related hypothesis argues that schizophrenia helps maintain charismatic leaders who utilize symptoms, such as paranoia and delusions, to create new cultures. Due to the altruistic nature of leadership, schizophrenia is selected to be maintained and bring benefits to the social group. Polimeni and Reiss theorize reduced fertility in schizophrenic patients in comparison to the group- selection of honeybees since they rapidly multiply for survival.  Sexual Selection & Sex Differences in Schizophrenia  Instead of viewing schizophrenia as a by-product of brain evolution, one model presents schizophrenia to be one extreme of a sexually selected fitness indicator. This model hypothesizes schizophrenia to be a side effect in sexual selection for certain traits. Sexual selection concerns the mating choices of humans and other animals. These choices are based upon the principles of Charles‚Äô Darwin's theory of Natural Selection, in which traits that increase likelihood of survival are chosen for, and organisms that are deemed most fit are sexually selected for. Traits that function as fitness indicators are those revealing potential benefits rooted in genetic qualities. When choosing mates, animals go for those with better fitness indicators to ensure better benefits for them and their offspring. These indicators can be morphological traits as well as behavioral traits. A peacock's tail and a nightingale's courtship songs are examples of the two traits. Sexual-selection studies have shown that male height, muscularity, and facial structure, and female breasts and buttocks are important indicators. Previously, Crow and Randall partially integrated the idea of sexual selection in their models to explain schizophrenia. Fitness-indicator theory, a branch of sexual-selection theory, has been used to explain the evolutionary origins of schizophrenia. This model hypothesizes schizophrenia to be an extreme example of abnormal and undesirable mental and behavioral traits that function as fitness indicators. In this model, the fitness indicator related to schizophrenia is courtship ability, which involves verbal and behavioral aspects. Failure of developing this ability means impaired communication skills, which can be seen in patients with schizophrenia. Sexual selection is thus demonstrated within this model in that schizophrenia is correlated with reduced fertility in families in which this disorder is present. Yet, while this disorder does reduce the fertility rates in female schizophrenics, it is reduced three times more in male schizophrenics, which yields a potential explanation as to why there is a minimal amount of schizophrenic fathers within families. This sexual selection model, combined with the reduced rates of mate choice due to the extreme abnormality of the traits, should allow the disorder to be selected against and thus minimally represented within our population. Yet, the disorder remains moderately heritable begging the question as to why it is still so present within humans, as altering explanations, such as mutation rates, fail to explain why the rate of schizophrenia remains so high. Shaner, Miller, and Mintz (2004) hypothesize that Schizophrenia involves many gene loci, and thus evolved as an extreme variant of fitness indicator through mate choice. According to this hypothesis, the extreme variant of mental fitness provided by this disorder describes an allele in which neurodevelopmental sensitivity to Darwinian measures of reproductive strength such as fitness and survival adaptability, are increased. Hence this allele was deemed the fitness indicator model of schizophrenia, as it describes why ‚Äòfitter‚Äô families are able to develop successful courting mechanisms, while less fit families, such as those with schizophrenics, represent a reduced reproductive and marriage rate. Another theory debating the sexual selection model of schizophrenia differentiates between the sexual selection rates of schizophrenia between genders, alluding that the disorder presents differently in the male and female brains, and thus, generates diversity in hemispheric growth and explains the presence of psychosis remaining in the human race today (Crow, 1993). This theory hypothesizes that there is a difference in the onset of psychosis between the male and female genders, and this onset difference causes relation in a man to sexual dimorphism in the cerebral cortex. More specifically, this theory hypothesizes that the onset of psychosis in the male brain leads to the cortex developing more laterally, or asymmetrically, then a female with the same psychosis. This is important in that, since schizophrenia is often correlated with a basal level of intelligence within individuals, it becomes increasingly vital to examine the morphology of schizophrenic brains, as compared to brains without psychosis, to examine if there are physical changes underlying this lapse in intelligence. Findings within morphological studies on schizophrenia thus far has indicated that there is ventricular enlargement within a psychotic population, but that this finding was reported without evidence that this affects the bimodal distribution of the brain within experimental group, thereby the enlargement is not a characteristic of a particular subgroup (Crow, 1993). Theories explaining this tendency hypothesize that perhaps, similar to ventricular expansion in Alzheimer's-Dementia, that this expansion may be due to the tissue loss. Another thought revolves around the developmental aspects to the brain, in that, in childhood, the ventricles initially fill, and that a mutation or delay to this process may explain why the ventricles never reach normal size. This could indicate that there was an arrest in the process, potentially early termination of cerebral development. Alternative morphological outlooks, such as CT, MRI, and necroscopy, reported an overall finding of decreased brain size in schizophrenics. A probable cause is a decrease in gray matter, which presents another probable explanation as to why intelligence is decreased in this population. This model plays out initially with the epidemiological issue between sex based onset time differences; While not a ton of individuals report cases of schizophrenia in pre-pubescent stages, around the age of 15 the amount of male individuals reporting the disorder, as compared to females, is heightened, and the sexes do not become equivalent in reporting rate until about age 30, where females surpass males, and both sexes decrease diagnosis rate linearly. Compared to other models, this one better explains the post- puberty onset of schizophrenia and cases frequently beginning at ages correlating to peak mating efforts. Evidence has been found that patients with schizophrenia have reduced marriage and reproduction rates.  Other studies using evolutionary explanations  There are other studies that have evolutionary approaches to explaining schizophrenia, but their main focus is not explaining the schizophrenia enigma, which is based on acknowledging the consistent 1% prevalence rate across culture. Not all scholars agree to it. Some scholars focus on explaining the variance in prevalence rates among certain societies. The biocultural approach is used to try to explain this variance. This model primarily looks at the interaction between genetic heritage and cultural influences and how it impacts the onset of schizophrenia. Studies like this still take into account evolutionary factors but do not accept the schizophrenia enigma.

It is found in North America.  Overview  The Schizocosa ocreata is a spider that is most commonly known as the ‚Äúbrush-legged wolf spider‚Äù because of their distinct dark-colored fur-like coverings around their legs. The S. ocreata are commonly found in North American states and are predated, typically in areas of large forestry, by many organisms that are visually acuteClark, D.L., Roberts, J.A., Rector, M. et al. Spectral reflectance and communication in the wolf spider, Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz): simultaneous crypsis and background contrast in visual signals. Behav Ecol Sociobiol 65, 1237‚Äì1247 (2011). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-011-1137-y such as various birds, the American toad (Anaxyrus americanus), and other large organisms. Similarly to other species, these spiders do not actually produce webs, but depend on their other acute senses, such as vision, to still exhibit elements of exploitative competition. Some interesting aspects of the S. ocreata are the female and male dynamics during mating and post-copulation. A lot of the time, females will aggressively try to kill the males after mating and hence cause the males to use their venom as a mechanism of defense. Research on the effects of early juvenile infection on the immunity of these spiders as adults is also currently being done; it was discovered that males that were exposed to P. aeruginosa as a juvenile were more likely to have higher adult encapsulation rates as well as have an increased density of melanization. The process of melanization is a key element in immunity because this process produces melanin and aids in wound healing by activating the prophenoloxidase. According to current research, the only spiders that are classified as ‚Äúvenomous spiders‚Äù by the Mayo Clinic includes the black widow spider and the brown recluse spider; S. ocreata spiders are not definitively harmless. Hence, it is important to seek medical attention if you are unsure of the kind of spider bite you have, feel respiratory distress, or are in severe pain. Rachel Gilbert, Richard D. Karp, George W. Uetz, Effects of juvenile infection on adult immunity and secondary sexual characters in a wolf spider, Behavioral Ecology, Volume 27, Issue 3, May-June 2016, Pages 946‚Äì954, https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arv241  Description  The S. ocreata has dark furry legs that distinguish this spider from other spiders in the Schizocosa genus. In addition, the tufts of bristle pair on the male is a secondary sexual characteristic that is the only physical feature that distinguishes this spider from its sibling species. Scheffer, Sonja J., et al. ‚ÄúSexual Selection, Male Morphology, and the Efficacy of Courtship Signalling in Two Wolf Spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae).‚Äù Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, vol. 38, no. 1, 1996, pp. 17‚Äì23. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4601166. Accessed 20 Oct. 2020.  Diet  The S. ocreata‚Äôs diet mainly includes crickets (Acheta domesticus), many different insect species, and the CollembolaWise, David H, and James D Wagner. ‚ÄúEvidence of exploitative competition among young stages of the wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata.‚Äù Oecologia vol. 91,1 (1992): 7-13. doi:10.1007/BF00317234, but it was found that diet can largely impact sexual behaviors as well. In a well established research study, the females that were well-fed actually were a lot more receptive to the males during mating, while those that had limited food were much less receptive. The large amount of food available for consumption is thought to help aid the spiders to allocate their resources and energy to reproductive success. Brian Moskalik, George W. Uetz \\"Female feeding history impacts gonad development and reproductive timing in the wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz, 1844),\\" The Journal of Arachnology, 44(2), 171-175, (1 August 2016)  Webs  The S. ocreata wolf spiders do not make webs, but do capture prey in different ways. Past research shows that there is usually limited food for the spiders that are found to build webs and wander. But, the spiders that do not build webs, such as the Schizocosa ocreata, show signs that they utilize exploitative competition in order to capture prey.  Reproduction and life cycle  = Molting = During the process of molting, old outer layers of an animal are shed to allow for new growth to occur. This molting process is an important element for the animal to become sexually developed as well, and it was found to be an important process for the S. ocreata. Wrinn, K., & Uetz, G. (2007). Impacts of leg loss and regeneration on body condition, growth, and development time in the wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata. Canadian Journal of Zoology, 85 (7), 823-831 DOI: 10.1139/Z07-063 In addition, the process of molting, gonad development, and reproductive timing in females is all impacted by the female spiders‚Äô feeding history. Research shows that there was much variation in the number of instars, the time for development, the width of the cephalothorax, and the mass varied with different dietary patterns. Instars refer to the phases between two molting periods when an invertebrate animal develops into sexual maturity. The females that were well-fed actually needed more moltings to become sexually mature, needed less time for sexual development, and were found to be heavier than those that were starved long-term. A common behavior for S. ocreata spiders is self-amputation in order to regenerate a damaged limb. However, the spiders that had regenerating legs needed about an additional 3.7 days to molt. Although the spiders that had regenerating legs need additional time to molt, when talking about the number of additional moltings that are needed, these spiders usually only need one more molting. = Lifespan = The development of the S. ocreata spiders closely resembles most spiders; they start as an egg and develop physically into mini versions of their parents and live for a couple years. They undergo multiple shedding of their skin throughout development and eventually undergo sexual development in order to reproduce and lay eggs. However, the eggs that the females lay are very much affected by the females‚Äô diet history too. The number as well as the diameter of eggs was compared between well-fed females and food limited females. It was found that the females treated with a low diet had less egg numbers and both smaller egg diameter and volume than the well-fed females.  Mating  = Mate searching behavior = Cuticular hydrocarbons have been discovered to play a major role as a sex pheromone in spiders. The chemical cues that the female S. ocreata uses contain information that is species specific and are able to communicate their own mating status. This signal is also able to reveal the history of what they have eaten in order to present their honest states. Although the chemical cues tell a lot about the state of the female, there is no research to conclude that the male chemical cues can exhibit signals. = Female/male interactions = There are two main types of approaches to copulation between the male and female spider. There is the coercive and the cooperative way. During a research observational study, it was discovered that the males would sometimes use their fang-like teeth to scar and mark the females during copulation. . Scar tissues were detected in the area below the cephalothorax but above the coxa of the leg in females. This scarred area was consistent with the part of the female‚Äôs body that the males attached their fangs on. The control, the group where virgin females were studied, showed no scar tissues on the area below the cephalothorax. Johns, J.L., Roberts, J.A., Clark, D.L. et al.

But, if they become too aggressive, the male spiders will inject them with venom in order to reduce the possibility of post-mating cannibalism, where the females would attack and eat the males. Even though it‚Äôs unknown how much impact the venom injections have on the females, there is a possibility that there is a cost for the male‚Äôs future reproductive success as well. The death of a female due to the injection of the male venom could impact them in some way that we do not yet know about.  Social behavior  = Adult sociality = Social behaviors of spiders and other animals are very much linked, and more specifically, there is an interplay between social exposure and mating preferences. When researchers looked at how the social environment impacts the females‚Äô visual preference for the males with larger tufts, it was found that female S. ocreata spiders were more receptive towards the males they were more familiar with. Since males are the only ones that have tufts, which is the area on the forelegs covered in bristles, the usage of the multifactorial approach allowed the researchers to see how the female preferences are decided. The male‚Äôs tuft size phenotype is a significant factor that predicts how females will choose. Hence, females that were more exposed to the small-tufted males were more likely to be receptive to the small-tufted males. But, females that were more exposed to large-tufted males were more likely to be receptive to the large- tufted males. But, females are slightly more selective in that they increased their preference for the large-tufted males more than than the small-tufted male. Stoffer, B., Uetz, G.W. Tuft size matters: the effects of adult visual social experience on female mate preferences in a wolf spider. Behav Ecol Sociobiol 70, 2211‚Äì2221 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-016-2225-9  Enemies  = Predators = Some of the predators of the S. ocreata are organisms that are very visually keen and able to come from above the spiders, such as various bird species. The American toad (Anaxyrus americanus) and other large organisms also prey on the S. ocreata as well. = Immunity = When various pathogens enter the S. ocreata, they have immunological mechanisms within their system to fight them off. However, it is still unclear the mechanism with which the S. ocreata is able to reduce the immunological inflammation and responses. In order to test whether the S. ocreata has immune functions, researchers injected bacterial derivatives like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to elicit immune responses. But, an issue with studies like these is that most spiders actually are exposed to various bacteria through oral ingestion. Spiders also digest their food externally, so therefore enzymes are being secreted externally, which causes the food to be broken down outside of their body. Much of the research studies reveal that a lot of spiders have antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to the gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and fungi. These AMPs are found mainly in hemocytes and sub- esophageal nerves. When male S. ocreata spiders ingested around 600 Colony Forming Units/microliter, it was found that the spiders only had 291 Colony Forming Units in 3 microliters of their hemolymph. Hence, this suggested that there potentially is an immune system that works to prevent the ingested pathogens from getting into the hemolymph, which is the blood equivalent in most invertebrates. The CFU count in the hemolymph system shows that the spiders‚Äô immune functions are working in some aspects to reduce the pathogens. However, further research needs to be done to determine the definite mechanism for how this occurs. = Parasites = It was also found that adult males that had experience with bacterial infection in their juvenile days, actually had a stronger response to encapsulation when measured as an adult. Encapsulation is a type of immune response that is dependent on phenoloxidase; it‚Äôs widely used as a defense against macro-parasites. However, even though encapsulation response strength was found to be significantly higher in males who had previous juvenile exposure. But, this does not mean that all immune responses are stronger.  Protective coloration and behavior  These spiders fight off attacks from their own species (ie. male fighting off female aggression after copulation), but they also have different techniques of protective coloration and ways of fighting different prey off as well. The courting males of the brush-legged wolf spider, Schizocosa ocreata, actually use their colorations to gain mates. But, their coloration and behavior heavily interact with one another. Since color helps them to be detected, the spiders that are in the state of courting are able to be detected at a much faster rate than the spiders that are simply walking. The stationary spiders, or those that are not moving, are detected much less than both the walking and courting spiders. But, the ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù technique, which is representative of the stationary spider, is a highly effective tactic when faced with predators. In addition, the S. ocreata have a large stripe on the dorsal area of their body, which allows them to overlap visually with their territory, and the dark color in the lateral area aids in providing some level of crypticity and protection from predators that are physically above them. Since behavior and predation are innately related, behavioral plasticity is important for reducing predation by those that are acute for vision. Rubi, Tricia L., et al. ‚ÄúCourtship Behavior and Coloration Influence Conspicuousness of Wolf Spiders (Schizocosa Ocreata (Hentz)) to Avian Predators.‚Äù Behavioural Processes, vol. 162, May 2019, pp. 215‚Äì220., doi:10.1016/j.beproc.2018.12.023.  Physiology  = Locomotion = The spiders that are courting move down a more winding path and also utilize their abdomens to move as well as use their legs. Although both the courting and walking spiders move in a similar way, the courting spiders tend to spend more time moving than the walking spiders. The courting spiders‚Äô forelegs are also almost always constantly in motion. But, when there is loss of haemolymph fluids, that could also lead to reduced mobility. = Digestion = These spiders use an external digestive system; they secrete the enzymes to digest the food, not within their gut, but outside themselves. These spiders have an exoskeleton, but when they have damage to their exoskeleton, there is a loss of haemolymph which can end up being consequential. A constant supply of blood volume will be needed for hydraulic locomotion and may cause a reduced mobility.  Bites to humans and animals  = Venom = The only spiders that are found to be venomous in the United States are the black widow and the brown recluse. Hence, there is not a conclusion on whether the S. ocreata spider will be lethal or poisonous to humans, but it‚Äôs not found to be venomous. Venomous spiders.

This fly is found in the southern United States, Central America, and South America. Historically, it has also been called Oncopsia seductrix Hennig or Oncopsia mexicana. G. flavifrons live, reproduce, and lay their eggs on the bark of trees in the early stages of decay. In this species, it is common to see the maile flies to exhibit aggression in the presence of the females. These males may attack the copulating pair to help decrease the chances of other males mating and increase their own chances.  Phylogeny  = Neriidae family = G. flavifrons is part of the Neriidae family of flies, which are broadly characterized by their elongated, forward-facing antennae with bristles along the top and a pedicel connecting to the middle region of the first flagellomere of the antenna. Species in this family typically display sexual dimorphism. Although they have been found in multiple regions around the world, the Neriidae family is mainly concentrated and is most diverse in the tropics. Currently, members of the Neriidae family are accepted as one of the families in the larger Nerioidea superfamily, which also includes the diverse Micropezidae with sub-families Neriidae and Cypselosomatidae making up the two less-diverse sister taxa. The Neriidae family is divided into two subfamilies, Neriinae and Telostylinae, which can be distinguished by the presence of antennal sockets in the former and the lack thereof in the latter. G. flavifrons falls within the Neriinae subfamily according to phylogenetic analysis. Despite multiple methods of characterization being used in the past, the Neriidae clade was always supported by data, with many of the ancestral characteristics, such as an elongated head and top-oriented antennal bristles, remaining consistent across multiple phylogenetic trees. = Glyphidops genus = All species of Neriids outside of the Australian-Oriental region can be traced to a single origin. Ancestral traits still present in these species are larger frontal and genal regions of the head, shorter femoral length, and the presence of notopleural bristles on the forecoxae of males. G. flavifrons are further classified into the Nerius group, which is characterized by larger female size, polished dorsal surface of the antennae, and a reduction in bristle length. Glyphidops is the most diverse Neotropical genera and cannot be further broken down into sub-genera based on analysis showing that the characteristic dense, whitish antennal pubescence was derived from a minimum of two convergence events.  Distribution  G. flavifrons can be found in southern North America, Central America, and South America. More broadly, these regions are defined as the Nearctic Region (southern United States) and the Neotropical Region (Central and South America). It is therefore one of the most widely distributed flies in the Neriidae family.  Life History  = Egg = G. flavifrons eggs laid in situ on C. papaya and T. zebrina tree stems hatch on average 58 ¬± 4 hours after being laid. Eggs have a semi-cylindrical shape with a blunt posterior region measuring between 1-1.24 mm. Each egg has two longitudinally lateral hatching lines within the rear of the egg body. Respiratory filaments extend from the anterior portion of the egg body and can measure up to 3.21 times its length. Before hatching, larvae move the body and lower jaw against the inner wall of the egg until they break through the posterior section. = Larvae = The larval stage is defined by three distinct larval instars. Total larval development time across all three instars is 10 ¬± 1 days, with larvae consistently presenting as worm-like with hairless, light-to-semi-transparent bodies. While in the larval stage, the head is fully retractable and has two mouth hooks protruding from the lower jaw. The thorax has well-defined pro-, meso-, and meta- sections with eight distinct abdominal sections containing small spines on all but two sections.  L1  Larvae range from 1.22 to 2.52 mm in length. This instar is characterized by bi-segmented antennae with an ovular top portion and a mandible that is slightly sclerotized, three times longer than it is wide, and containing 7-8 ventral teeth. No anterior spiracles can be observed at this stage.  L2  Larvae range from 2.95- 6.2 mm in length. Antennae are split into two antennomeres, or sections that are distally ovular. The number of teeth increases from 7-8 in the first instar to 10 teeth in the second instar. Anterior spiracles can be seen and measure as 2.5 times longer than the greatest width.  L3  Larvae range from 6-11.6 mm in length. Antennae have three antennomeres and the mandible no longer has individual teeth, but rather is completely fused into a mouth hook. The anterior spiracle is 0.8 times as wide as it is long and contains 9-11 digits. = Puparium = The pupa forms beneath the outer cuticle of the larvae and is 5.48-7.94 mm in length. It is reddish-brown with prominent wrinkles on two of the segments. Anterior spiracles are situated at the front of the pupa and contain 9-11 digits, all sclerotized. The puparium stage lasts 13 ¬± 2 days, with pupation itself lasting between 150 and 175 minutes. The adult fly emerges from a circular suture between the anterior spiracles and halfway through the abdominal sections, which completely separate as the adult emerges.  Mating  Copulation takes place on the same tree segments that the females eventually oviposit on. The bark of these trees is thin (0.5-1.0 cm thick) and still firmly attached to the inner bark. Copulation happens either before or between bouts of oviposition. Once a male happens upon a female, he approaches and mounts her, typically with little resistance. Copulation begins when the male positions his postabdomen over the ovipositor of the female, who raises the tip of her abdomen in response. If the female does not immediately respond to the male mounting her, he vibrates one or both of his legs next to the female's head. Copulation itself is brief, lasting approximately 24.10¬± 5.18 seconds, and is preceded by little or no pre- copulatory courtship. Males have been observed following females post- copulation as the female oviposits, sometimes mating between each bout of oviposition. = Male Aggression = Male aggression typically only occurs in the presence of a female. Lone males crossing paths while looking for a mate are most likely to ignore each other, although there is a chance one or both will display low-level aggression in the form of jerky, sudden dashes toward the other individual. The majority of aggressive male behavior is observed in the presence of females. Males are known to attack copulating pairs, most often with preliminary threat tactics such as stilting or dashing toward the pair in an effort to displace the male. Usually the battle is won by the larger male. Higher-level aggression manifests in physical contact initiated by one male lunging at one another and is resolved either when one male walks away or both males fall off the bark.  Oviposition  Oviposition occurs on the same bark that mating did. Females wander over the surface of the bark without an obvious pattern while periodically inserting their ovipositor in the bark to leave behind an egg. Ovipositors remain embedded in the bark for variable amounts of time at variable depths. Some females have been observed to spread their oviposition across the surface of the bark they are on, while others stay in the same small area for longer periods of time, continuously inserting and extracting their ovipositor multiple times in close proximity to the previous puncture. Females who move around while ovipositing have been shown to move multiple centimeters between punctures.

Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, Cottonwood Airport is assigned P52 by the FAA and CTW by the IATA.  History  Cottonwood Airport was originally opened as the Clemenceau Airport on April 20, 1929. with land leased from the United Verde Extension mining company.Smith, Nancy (1993) , \\"Clemenceau Airport's Flight Through History\\". Retrieved 2020-03-02. William Andrews Clark, III, grandson of Senator William A. Clark, was heavily involved in plans for development of the airport. He was killed in an aviation accident on May 14, 1932; this ended the interest of Clark family and the United Verde Copper Company in further development of aviation. The airport was further developed during the 1930s by the Civil Works Administration though temporarily closed in May 1940 as the original lease of the land expired. Shortly thereafter, on May 23, 1940, the land was deeded to Yavapai County for use as the Clemenceau airport. During the Second World War, the Williams Flying School trained cadets for the Civilian Pilot Training Program at the Clemenceau Airport. The name of the airport was changed to the Cottonwood airport in a funding request sometime between 1945 and 1957.  Facilities and aircraft  Cottonwood Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway: * 14/32 measuring asphalt For the 12-month period ending April 23, 2015, the airport had 18,900 aircraft operations, an average of 51 per day: 98% general aviation, 1.75% air taxi, and .25% military. At that time there were 13 aircraft based at this airport: 73% single-engine, 2% ultralight, 15% multi-engine, no jet, and no helicopters.

Mecaphesa asperata was formerly in the genus Misumenops under the name Misumenops asperatus. Howell (2004) provides the following diagnostic/identifying characteristics: \\"M. asperatus is distinguished from Misumenoides and Misumena in that the carapace, abdomen and legs are distinctively covered with numerous short stiff spines.
