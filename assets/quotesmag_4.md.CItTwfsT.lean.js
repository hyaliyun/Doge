The name is a word largely of British English usage. Origins and building The Pantechnicon, Motcomb Street, 2017 The word \\"Pantechnicon\\" is an invented one, formed from the Greek pan (\\"all\\") and techne (\\"art\\"). It was originally the name of a large establishment in Motcomb Street, Belgravia, London, opened around 1830. It combined a picture gallery, a furniture shop, and the sale of carriages, while its southern half was a sizable warehouse for storing furniture and other items. Seth Smith, whose family were originally from Wiltshire, was a builder/property developer in the early 19th century, and constructed much of the new housing in BelgraviaA Guide the Architecture of London , then a country area. Their clients required storage facilities and this was built on an awkward left-over triangular site with a Greek style Doric column fa√ßade, and called Pantechnicon, pseudo-Greek for \\"pertaining to all the arts or crafts\\". Subsequently, special wagons were designed with sloping ramps to more easily load furniture, with the building name on the side. The very large, distinctive, and noticeable horse-drawn vans that were used to collect and deliver the customers' furniture came to be known as \\"Pantechnicon vans.\\" From around 1900, the name was shortened to simply Pantechnicon. The Pantechnicon Ltd, a furniture storage and removal company, continued to trade until the 1970s. The building was largely destroyed by fire in 1874, but the fa√ßade still exists and the usefulness of the vans was by then well established and they had been adopted by other firms. As of 2015 the fa√ßade and the building behind it has been leased by its owner, Grosvenor Estates, to Cubitt House, a company specializing in pubs and restaurants in the Belgravia area, and is to be redeveloped into a \\"food and retail emporium\\" over six floors, including a basement and a roof-terrace. Design A 1947 Bedford MLZ pantechnicon Though small by modern standards, the vans were impressively large by those of their own time. They came in lengths of between 12 and 18 feet, and were up to 7 feet broad. The roof was a segment of a cylinder 8 inches higher in the middle than at the edges to ensure ready drainage but it had boards round the edges to allow stowage of extra items. Below the roof-line the body was a cuboid box except that behind the space required by the front wheels when turning tightly, the floor was lowered to permit greater internal headroom. This was achieved by cranking the back axle downwards as in a float. The lowered floor also saved some of the lifting which was a feature of using normal horse-drawn lorries and vans, which needed a deck high enough to fit the steering mechanism below it. Access was obtained through hinged doors at the rear. Outside these, the tailboard was hinged upwards from the level of the well. Use Some pantechnicons were drawn by two horses in tandem. This seems to have been so as to allow entry to relatively narrow town lanes and such places as the warehouse doorways. To give the driver a clear view of obstructions and to enable him to control the lead horse, he was usually seated on the front of the roof. From the early 1900s onward lift-off container bodies were introduced which could be lifted off the chassis and transferred to a rail wagon or to the hold of a ship. The value of these vans seems to have been quite quickly appreciated so that removal firms other than The Pantechnicon operated them, sometimes over long distances between towns, a business which was eventually superseded by the spread of the railways. Popular culture Charles Dickens mentions the Pantechnicon as a place to buy carriages in Pictures from Italy and The Uncommercial Traveler. William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair (1848) mentions the Pantechnicon as a storage service: :The house was dismantled; the rich furniture and effects, the awful chandeliers and dreary blank mirrors packed away and hidden, the rich rosewood drawing-room suite was muffled in straw, the carpets were rolled up and corded, the small select library of well-bound books was stowed into two wine-chests, and the whole paraphernalia rolled away in several enormous vans to the Pantechnicon, where they were to lie until Georgy's majority. An adventure with a runaway pantechnicon is one of the episodes in the Arnold Bennett novel, The Card (1911). M.R. James mentions the fire that partially destroyed the Pantechnicon in his ghost story \\"Count Magnus,\\" as having probably destroyed some of his main character's papers. H.G. Wells mentions the Pantechnicon as a concert venue in Star Begotten (1937). Modern usage A pantech truck or van is a word derivation of \\"pantechnicon\\" commonly currently used in Australia. A pantech is a truck or van with a freight hull made of (or converted to) hard panels. Such vehicles can be used for chilled freight, or as removal vans. References *Course, E.

The Newport Pier is one of two municipal piers located within the city of Newport Beach, California, at the center of the Balboa Peninsula. It is 1,032 feet (314.6 m) long. The pier replaced the McFadden Wharf (1888-1939) and the site is registered as California Historical Landmark number 794. History Aerial view of the Newport Municipal Pier at Newport Beach, California in the 1940s The original pier was known as McFadden Wharf when it was completed in the summer of 1888 by local landowners James and Robert McFadden. The wharf served as a shipping connection for the McFaddens to offload lumber, hides and other merchandise. In 1890, they connected it to the Santa Ana and Newport Railway for commercial transport into Orange, San Bernardino, and Riverside Counties. The McFaddens sold the site in 1902 to W.S. Collins, who began to transform the area for residential and recreational use. The expansion of the Los Angeles passenger railway system to the wharf in 1905 catalyzed the development of the city of Newport Beach as a tourist destination. In 1922, the pier was remodeled by the City of Newport and remained a shipping terminus until 1939 when it was destroyed in a hurricane. Newport Municipal Pier The current pier was reconstructed on the same site in 1940. Located at Oceanfront Boulevard and 21st Place, it is popular for angling, strolling and dining. At the end of the pier sits a restaurant called the \\"Newport Pier Grill and Sushi.\\" The restaurant has an outdoor patio called the William Wright Terrace, which adds and can seat up to 28 with a view of the water. The Newport Pier Grill and Sushi has been closed since 2012. At the base of the pier is the Dory Fishing Fleet, a beachside fishing cooperative founded in 1891. Also at the base of the pier is the headquarters of the city fire department's Lifeguard division. It serves as the base for Newport Beach Junior Lifeguards, a program run by the fire department that allows for kids to receive basic water training.

Westville is a re-creation of a historic village with 17 furnished antebellum buildings. In the future, 14 more will be moved to their new site. The buildings were moved onto the museum site in Columbus to create an authentic village environment. Westville preserves, demonstrates, and interprets the life and culture of 19th century South Georgia. This is accomplished by maintaining an authentic village environment, collecting and preserving artifacts, demonstrating traditional work skills, and workshops and special events. Every day, \\"townspeople\\" in period dress demonstrate woodworking, dressmaking, blacksmithing, and other skills from the mid-19th century. Buildings include a courthouse, churches, stores, craft shops, and residences. Westville moved to Columbus, Georgia from Lumpkin, Georgia and re- opened June 22, 2019. Brief history of John Word West The history of Westville is connected to Lt. Col. John Word West, a history professor at North Georgia College in Dahlonega. West was born in 1876 at a critical time of change in Georgia due to dramatic economic and social changes caused by the recent American Civil War (1861‚Äì65). Also, the great changes were brought on by the new growth of Atlanta and the subsequent decline of farming. As a child West spent many hours listening to his grandparents talk about the old way of life that was disappearing. West listened intently and absorbed the stories and learned the old skills. Later he would convert those experiences into his own museum where he preserved those stories and old skills. A high school and college teacher, West committed himself and his own money in 1928 to saving \\"Georgiana\\" - the buildings, tools, furniture, and work skills of Georgia's settlement. He admired the work of two other Americans who also took history into their own hands: Rockefeller and Ford. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (Standard Oil Company) had started Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia in 1927. Henry Ford (automobile maker) had started Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan in 1928. West engaged both men for advice and may have even traded artifacts with Ford. Then, in 1928 John West opened \\"The Fair of 1850\\" on old Highway 41 in Jonesboro, Georgia, about twenty miles south of Atlanta. For West, the Fair was the Deep South version of Williamsburg and Greenfield Village. From 1932 to 1934, he moved the oldest buildings in his collection to the Fair's site. One of those buildings he moved to Jonesboro was his grandparents log house that he spent so much time in as a youth. Perhaps just as importantly, he and others demonstrated the \\"old-fashioned\\" crafts for the visitors - woodworking, cloth-making, open-hearth cooking, shoe-making, and the like. West's cause was greater than his teacher's salary. It also turned out to be larger than the vision of Georgia's political leadership. West tried and failed to get the State to take over his project before he died in 1961. Westville's Lumpkin Era Historic Westville's Lead Blacksmith working at his forge However, the Fair was far from finished. Its rescue came from deep within rural Georgia and not from state government in Atlanta. Five years after West's death, the citizens of Stewart County decided to create a new industry-heritage tourism. Stewart County was at the time making a transition away from its traditional agricultural economy. The county still had many buildings and artifacts from the pre-Civil War days. It also had people who had grown up with the handicrafts that West loved. In some respects, then, the Stewart County of 1850 still existed in 1966. Dressmaker at Historic Westville The salvation of the West collection came from a colleague who know John West, and probably spent time as a youth at his Fair of 1850 - Dr. Joseph Mahan, curator of the Columbus Museum of Arts and Crafts (now Columbus Museum). Mahan took on the saving of West's legacy as his personal mission. Over dinner one evening at the Singers, Mahan explained the West Collection and his vision for the creation of a village where historic houses could be moved and saved, historic crafts and trades performed, and employ locals in the process. With much encouragement and leadership from Joseph Mahan, he received for the museum the donation of 59 acres of land on the south side of Lumpkin. Thus the establishment of Westville Historic Handicrafts in June, 1966. Two of Historic Westville's interpreters, in the Singer House's parlor By 1969, the new museum had purchased the West Collection and opened to the public in Spring 1970. The six oldest buildings at the Jonesboro site were moved to Westville, along with many West artifacts. The rest of the collection has been assembled mostly by donation from many different people. In 2001 Westville Historic Handicrafts became Historic Westville with the goal of expanding interpretation from handicrafts to interpreting living history, demonstrations and crafts while telling the story of west Georgia history. Westville's executive board chairman, Tripp Blankenship, had been seriously considering moving the living history museum to Columbus, Georgia., Ledger-Enquirer article, accessed 26 Nov 2013\\"About Us\\", Official website of Westville, accessed 4 Sep 2012 A protest against the plan was staged on October 23, 2014. As of July 2016, the Lumpkin site was closed.Westville website New site Historic Westville reopened on June 22, 2019 in Columbus, GA. The site is open Wednesday-Sunday to the public and offers school programs and field trips. Plans to expand interpretation and move other buildings from the Lumpkin site are being set in motion as funding allows.https://westville.org/ Today, John West's contribution is appreciated in a larger context. With the exception of a few years in the 1960s, West's project has demonstrated \\"Georgiana\\" to the public continuously since 1928. Historic Westville therefore can rightly claim to be rooted in the third- oldest living-history project in America. Westville remains the lasting legacy of John West. As of October 2019, Historic Westville has live demonstrations and crafting interpreters every day. They are dressed in clothing accurate for the time of 1840-1860. Their living historians engage the public with dialogue about living in South Georgia during the 19th century. Emphasis lies on the unique and diverse stories of the people that made the area of South Georgia their home. Historic Westville currently has five interpreters that are skilled in traditional trades. Leatherworking and boot making are shown in the Singer Boot Shop, while South Georgia quilting is in the Singer House. Traditional carpentry is in West Wood Shop, while Blacksmithing is in the Woodruff Blacksmith Shop. Westville is also home to a dressmaker that hand stitches all of the clothing worn by employed interpreters at the site. Open hearth cooking will be available early winter 2019. Historic methods and techniques are used by the craftspeople. Tools from the time period are on display in the houses and occasionally, still used. http://www.westville.org See also * List of museums in Georgia (U.S. state) ReferencesExternal links * Official website of Westville Category:1966 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Living museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Open-air museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Museums established in 1966 Category:Museums in Stewart County, Georgia Category:Rural history museums in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Westville (Georgia)"},{"id":"3949597","text":"This is a list of Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada in order of time served in office as joint premier, both as premier and as deputy.

He received a state funeral for his distinguished literary career, and for his contributions to the codification of standard Macedonian. Literary works Koneski wrote poetry and prose. His most famous collections of poetry are: Mostot, Pesni, Zemjata i ljubovta, Vezilka, Zapisi, Cesmite, Stari i novi pesni, Seizmograf, among others. His collection of short stories Vineyard is also famous.Blesok:Bla≈æe Koneski Koneski was a distinguished translator of poetry from German, Russian, Slovenian, Serbian and Polish; he translated the works of Njegos, Preshern, Heine, Blok, Neruda, and others. Awards and recognitions Blaze Koneski won a number of literary prizes such as: the AVNOJ prize, the Njego≈° prize, the Golden Wreath (\\"Zlaten Venec\\") of the Struga Poetry Evenings, the Award of the Writer‚Äôs Union of the USSR, Herder Prize and others.Diversity: Blazhe Koneski The Faculty of Philology at the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje is named after Blaze Koneski. Work on standard Macedonian Koneski is remembered for his work on codifying the Macedonian standard language. He is the author of On Standard Macedonian (), Grammar of Standard Macedonian (), History of Macedonian (), among other works. He was one of the editors of Macedonian Dictionary (). Criticism Bulgarian linguists such as Iliya Talev, in his History of the Macedonian Language,Slavistische Beitr√§ge, Volumes 67‚Äì69, Talev, Iliya, Publisher: Sagner, 1973, pp. 154-159. have accused Koneski of plagiarizing Kiril Mirchev's Historical Grammar of the Bulgarian Language because both authors analyzed the same corpus of texts. In Bulgaria, he has also been accused of manipulating historical facts for political goals.This is eloquently formulated in May 1945 in a statement of Bla≈æe Koneski who is later proclaimed in Yugoslavia as the ‚Äúcreator‚Äù of the Macedonian language ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe future is ours. And this means that the past is ours also.‚Äù Political power exercised by the communist state ensures the power over the future which guarantees also the monopoly over history.

There has been also claimed the Macedonian standard was Serbianized with the help of Koneski.The Implementation of Standard Macedonian: Problems and Results Victor A. Friedman University of Chicago Published in: International Journal of the Sociology of Language, Vol. 131, 1998. 31-57. According to Christian Voss the turning point in the Serbianization of Macedonian took place in the late 1950s, that coincided with the preparation period for the dictionary of Koneski published between 1961 and 1966.Voss C., The Macedonian Standard Language: Tito‚ÄîYugoslav Experiment or Symbol of ‚ÄòGreat Macedonian‚Äô Ethnic Inclusion? in C.

Goetingen, Formation of the standard language - Macedonian in the Slavic languages, Volume 32, Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co. KG, 2014, , chapter 109.

It is a blend of 85% Bordeaux region wines (Semillon for the Blanc and for the Ros√©, Merlot for the Rouge) and 15% macerated liqueurs, mostly citrus liqueurs (peels of sweet oranges from Spain and Morocco and peels of bitter green oranges from Haiti). The mix is then stirred in oak vats until blended. During the aging process, Lillet is handled as a Bordeaux wine (undergoing fining, racking, filtering etc.). In the original Kina Lillet formulation (so named with respect to its status as a quinquina), quinine liqueur made of cinchona bark from Peru was included among its ingredients. \\"Lillet\\" belongs to a family of aperitifs known as tonic wines because of the addition of quinine liqueur. Varieties * Kina Lillet (1887‚Äì1986): A liqueur made with white wine mixed with fruit liqueurs and flavored with quinine. The \\"Kina\\" in its name is derived from quinine's main ingredient: the bark of the kina-kina (or cinchona) tree. * Lillet Dry (1920‚Äì?): A drier formula created for the British market. It is considered the Kina Lillet mentioned by Ian Fleming's character James Bond when he created the Vesper Martini. * Lillet Rouge (1962‚Äìpresent): A red-wine-based liqueur first suggested by the American wine merchant and importer Michael Dreyfus, one of the first to import Lillet into the US. * Lillet Blanc (1986‚Äìpresent): A sweeter variant of the white-wine-based version with reduced quinine flavoring. It replaced Kina Lillet. * Lillet Ros√© (2011‚Äìpresent): A ros√©-wine-based liqueur. History In 1872, the brothers Paul and Raymond Lillet, distillers and merchants of wines and spirits, founded their company La Maison Lillet in Podensac, south of Bordeaux, France. The idea of making aperitifs in Bordeaux came from Father Kermann, a doctor who left Brazil at the beginning of Louis XVI's reign. Back in France, he settled in Bordeaux, where he produced liqueurs and fortifiers from plants such as quinine. During that time, Bordeaux became one of the most important places for the European wine business.Lillet 1862‚Äì1985 Le pari d'un entreprise girondine, Olivier Londeix, Presses universitaires de Bordeaux, pp. 13‚Äì29 It was also France's main harbour for products imported from the Caribbean islands. At the end of the 19th century, people developed a great fear of illness as a consequence of the discoveries made by Louis Pasteur (1822‚Äì1895). Nevertheless, \\"Wine\\", Pasteur said, \\"can be considered with good reason as the most healthful and the most hygienic of all beverages\\". As a result, tonic wines (with quinine) became very popular as quinine was used to fight fevers and ease malaria symptoms. In 1887, Pierre and Raymond Lillet created Kina Lillet. Originally blanc, when all other aperitifs were red, Lillet was the only aperitif from a specific geographic location, one of the most famous, the Bordeaux region, or more precisely Great Sauternes region (at that time Sauternes was covering appellations that are now considered as Bordeaux or Graves appellation). During the 1920s, Lillet exports greatly increased in Europe and Africa.Lillet 1862‚Äì1985 Le pari d'un entreprise girondine, Olivier Londeix, Presses universitaires de Bordeaux, pp. 157‚Äì165 The brand also became famous in France, thanks to advertising campaigns.Lillet 1862‚Äì1985 Le pari d'un entreprise girondine, Olivier Londeix, Presses universitaires de Bordeaux, pp. 141‚Äì156 At the same time, Lillet was served on transatlantic liners, part of the reason for its success with high society in New York. American bartenders used it for making fashionable cocktails. In 1962, Pierre Lillet, grandson of Raymond, keen to capitalize on America's growing taste for red wine, created Lillet Rouge for the American market. In the early part of the 1970s, Maison Lillet removed \\"Kina\\" from the brand name calling it simply Lillet. \\"Kina\\" had become a generic term used by many aperitifs to emphasise their quinine content, and was no longer relevant for the times. Lillet is the name of the family, and became the only name of the brand. To improve the quality and sustainability of the Lillet recipe, in 1985, Lillet was reformulated, after close work with the Bordeaux University's Institute of Oenology, applying modern oenology. To improve the balance between acidity and sweetness, the sugar content was slightly reduced, giving priority to the fruitiness while maintaining the same quinine bitterness concentration. In 2011, under cellarmaster Jean Bernard Blancheton, ros√© Lillet version was introduced aimed at female consumers.

In France, Lillet is usually served on ice with a slice of orange, or a lemon or lime peel. In Germany, Austria and Switzerland Lillet blanc is more often served as a Lillet Vive, a Lillet blanc long drink. A Lillet Vive is 5cl Lillet blanc, 10cl tonic water, a slice of cucumber, a strawberry and mint leaves. In other countries, especially in the US and UK, it is more often used as a cocktail ingredient. The best known Lillet cocktails are the Vesper, the Corpse Reviver #2, the 20th Century and the Old Etonian. Recipes appear in cocktail books including The Bartender's Bible by Gary Regan, the Savoy Cocktail Book by Harry Craddock and the Complete World Bartender Guide by Bob Sennett. In the 1930s the Savoy Cocktail Book published 22 Lillet cocktails recipes (46 Cointreau, 24 Dubonnet, 24 Chartreuse and 10 Grand Marnier, by comparison).Lillet 1862‚Äì1985 Le pari d'un entreprise girondine, Olivier Londeix, Presses universitaires de Bordeaux, p147 A Lillet spritz is a two- ingredient cocktail in which white or ros√© Lillet is mixed with sparkling water and a garnish such as mint, berries, cranberries, or thyme sprigs.https://vinepair.com/articles/20-best-two-ingredient-cocktail-drinks- recipes/ In the USA a booklet titled \\"The Lillet Book of Apertif Cocktails\\" was distributed with bottles of Lillet. It included a recipe which described a \\"Lillet Spritz\\" as \\"3 parts Lillet Blanc or Lillet Rose and 3 parts tonic water. Build over 3 large ice cubes in a tall wine glass and garnish with cucumber, mint and strawberry.\\"  Appearances in popular culture  ‚Ä¢ 1950s: The Duchess of Windsor, the American spouse of Edward VIII, was a great admirer of Lillet. She introduced Lillet to the high society, particularly at Fauchon, and into the upper-class hotels Parisian as George V or Ritz where she stayed regularly. ‚Ä¢ 1953: in the first Ian Fleming James Bond novel Casino Royale, James Bond invents and orders a Kina Lillet martini, which he named the \\"Vesper\\" after his love interest in the story: \\"A dry martini,\\" he said. \\"One. In a deep champagne goblet.\\" \\"Oui, Monsieur.\\" \\"Just a moment. Three measures of Gordon‚Äôs, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it‚Äôs ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon-peel. Got it?\\" \\"Certainly, monsieur.\\" The barman seemed pleased with the idea. ‚Ä¢ 1981: ‚ÄúLillet‚Äù is the preferred drink of serial killer Hannibal Lecter in the series of books written by Thomas Harris. ‚Ä¢ 2006 and 2008: The Vesper was again prepared for James Bond in the remake of Casino Royale and its follow up Quantum of Solace.

He said he met a very famous Spanish actress with whom he had a cordial conversation. She ignored him and looked at him with contempt when she discovered he worked at a seafood market. Tejero went on to perform in bit parts in Spanish movies, slowly gaining recognition. He was able to establish a bond with a production company called Animalario. In 2003, he was offered a role in D√≠as de f√∫tbol, for which he won the Goya Award for best new actor. In that same year, during the casting of the now-famous Spanish ensemble comedy Aqu√≠ no hay quien viva, he was originally offered the part of Paco, the video store clerk. However, a new role was subsequently created for him, that of Emilio, the concierge; this allowed him a much more visible role than originally planned. With the show's great success, Tejero has become a household name in Spain. Since then, he has had leading roles in films, such as El penalti m√°s largo del mundo.

In the work, Goya sought to commemorate Spanish resistance to Napoleon's armies during the occupation of 1808 in the Peninsular War. Along with its companion piece of the same size, The Second of May 1808 (or The Charge of the Mamelukes), it was commissioned by the provisional government of Spain at Goya's suggestion. The painting's content, presentation, and emotional force secure its status as a groundbreaking, archetypal image of the horrors of war. Although it draws on many sources from both high and popular art, The Third of May 1808 marks a clear break from convention. Diverging from the traditions of Christian art and traditional depictions of war, it has no distinct precedent, and is acknowledged as one of the first paintings of the modern era.Licht, pp. 116‚Äì127. According to the art historian Kenneth Clark, The Third of May 1808 is \\"the first great picture which can be called revolutionary in every sense of the word, in style, in subject, and in intention\\".Clark, p. 130. The Third of May 1808 has inspired a number of other major paintings, including a series by √âdouard Manet, and Pablo Picasso's Massacre in Korea and Guernica. Background Napoleon I of France declared himself First Consul of the French Republic on November 10, 1799, and crowned himself Emperor in 1804. Because Spain controlled access to the Mediterranean, the country was politically and strategically important to French interests. The reigning Spanish sovereign, Charles IV, was internationally regarded as ineffectual. Even in his own court he was seen as a \\"half-wit king who renounces cares of state for the satisfaction of hunting\\",Connell, pp. 145‚Äì146. and a cuckold unable to control his energetic wife, Maria Luisa of Parma. Napoleon took advantage of the weak king by suggesting the two nations conquer and divide Portugal, with France and Spain each taking a third of the spoils, and the final third going to the Spanish Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy, along with the title Prince of the Algarve. Godoy was seduced, and accepted the French offer. He failed, however, to grasp Napoleon's true intentions, and was unaware that his new ally and co- sovereign, the former king's son Ferdinand VII of Spain, was using the invasion merely as a ploy to seize the Spanish parliament and throne. Ferdinand intended not only that Godoy be killed during the impending power struggle, but also that the lives of his own parents be sacrificed. The Second of May 1808 was completed in 1814, two months before its companion work The Third of May 1808. It depicts the uprising that precipitated the executions of the third of May. Under the guise of reinforcing the Spanish armies, 23,000 French troops entered Spain unopposed in November 1807.Baines, Edward. History of the Wars of the French Revolution. Philadelphia: McCarty and Davis, 1835. p. 65. Even when Napoleon's intentions became clear the following February, the occupying forces found little resistance apart from isolated actions in disconnected areas, including Saragossa.Connell, pp. 145‚Äì148. Napoleon's principal commander, Marshal Joachim Murat, believed that Spain would benefit from rulers more progressive and competent than the Bourbons, and Napoleon's brother Joseph Bonaparte was to be made king.Licht, p. 109. After Napoleon convinced Ferdinand to return Spanish rule to Charles IV, the latter was left with no choice but to abdicate, on March 19, 1808, in favor of Joseph Bonaparte. Godoy was Prime Minister of Spain during the 1808 Napoleonic invasion of Spain. Although the Spanish people had accepted foreign monarchs in the past, they deeply resented the new French ruler. A French agent in Madrid reported: \\"Spain is different. The Spaniards have a noble and generous character, but they have a tendency to ferocity and cannot bear to be treated as a conquered nation. Reduced to despair, they would be prepared to unleash the most terrible and courageous rebellion, and the most vicious excesses.\\"Fraser, Ronald. Napoleon's Cursed War: Popular Resistance in the Spanish Peninsular War, p. 30. Verso, 2008. On May 2, 1808, provoked by news of the planned removal to France of the last members of the Spanish royal family, the people of Madrid rebelled in the Dos de Mayo Uprising. A proclamation issued that day to his troops by Marshal Murat read: \\"The population of Madrid, led astray, has given itself to revolt and murder. French blood has flowed. It demands vengeance. All those arrested in the uprising, arms in hand, will be shot.\\"Cowans, Jon. Modern Spain: A Documentary History. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2003. Goya commemorated the uprising in his The Second of May, which depicts a cavalry charge against the rebels in the Puerta del Sol square in the center of Madrid, the site of several hours of fierce combat.Licht, p. 112. Much the better known of the pair, The Third of May illustrates the French reprisals: before dawn the next day hundreds of Spaniards were rounded up and shot, at a number of locations around Madrid. Civilian Spanish opposition persisted as a feature of the ensuing five-year Peninsular War, the first to be called guerrilla war. Irregular Spanish forces considerably aided the Spanish, Portuguese, and British armies jointly led by Sir Arthur Wellesley, who first landed in Portugal in August 1808. By the time of the painting's conception, the public imagination had made the rioters symbols of heroism and patriotism.Murray, Christopher John. \\"The Third of May 1808‚Äì1814\\", in Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760‚Äì1850. Taylor and Francis, 2004. pp. 1133‚Äì1134. The Disasters of War (, plate 44, c. 1810‚Äì1812 Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was personally placed in a difficult position by the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped for a similar development in Spain. Several of his friends, like the poets Juan Mel√©ndez Vald√©s and Leandro Fern√°ndez de Morat√≠n, were overt , the term for the supporters‚Äîcollaborators in the view of many‚Äîof Joseph Bonaparte.Bareau, p. 45. Goya's 1798 portrait of the French ambassador-turned-commandant Ferdinand Guillemardet betrays a personal admiration.Licht, p. 111.Guillemardet came to Spain as French ambassador, and was the first foreigner Goya painted. Later Guillemardet brought a copy of the artist's back to France, where they were admired by Delacroix, and influenced the Romantic movement. Heras, p. 73. Although he maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary, Goya had by nature an instinctive dislike of authority.Clark, p. 129. He witnessed the subjugation of his countrymen by the French troops.That Goya had first-hand knowledge of events depicted in The Disasters of War is underscored by the title of one of his prints, I saw it. During these years he painted little, although the experiences of the occupation provided inspiration for drawings that would form the basis for his prints The Disasters of War (). In February 1814, after the final expulsion of the French, Goya approached the provisional government with a request to \\"perpetuate by means of his brush the most notable and heroic actions of our glorious insurrection against the Tyrant of Europe\\".Clark, p. 126. His proposal accepted, Goya began work on The Third of May. It is not known whether he had personally witnessed either the rebellion or the reprisals, despite many later attempts to place him at the events of either day.Connell, pp. 153‚Äì157. At the time, Goya may have been living in a house at the corner of the Puerta del Sol; however this is disputed and perhaps originated from a suspect account from the novelist Antonio de Trueba who supposedly heard it from Isidoro, Goya's gardener. Isidoro, it is claimed, said he accompanied the artist on the night of the third as he sketched the corpses of the slain. The painting=Description= The Third of May 1808 is set in the early hours of the morning following the uprisingHagen, Rose-Marie and Hagen, Rainer. What Great Paintings Say. Taschen, 2003. p. 363\\\\. and centers on two masses of men: one a rigidly poised firing squad, the other a disorganized group of captives held at gunpoint. Executioners and victims face each other abruptly across a narrow space; according to Kenneth Clark, \\"by a stroke of genius [Goya] has contrasted the fierce repetition of the soldiers' attitudes and the steely line of their rifles, with the crumbling irregularity of their target.\\"Clark, p. 127. A square lantern situated on the ground between the two groups throws a dramatic light on the scene. The brightest illumination falls on the huddled victims to the left, whose numbers include a monk or friar in prayer.This is consistent with Murat's desire to choose as victims members of the lower classes and the clergy who organized them. Boime, p. 297. To the immediate right and at the center of the canvas, other condemned figures stand next in line to be shot.It has been suggested that the disarray in which Goya depicted the victims was a decision of prudence: popular resistance to French forces could be memorialized, so long as there was no show of solidarity which would be threatening to the government of Fernando VII. Boime, pp. 299‚Äì300. The central figure is the brilliantly lit man kneeling amid the bloodied corpses of those already executed, his arms flung wide in either appeal or defiance. His yellow and white clothing repeats the colors of the lantern. His plain white shirt and sun-burnt face show he is a simple laborer.Licht, p. 116. On the right side stands the firing squad, engulfed in shadow and painted as a monolithic unit. Seen nearly from behind, their bayonets and their shako headgear form a relentless and immutable column. Most of the faces of the figures cannot be seen, but the face of the man to the right of the main victim, peeping fearfully towards the soldiers, acts as a at the back of the central group. Without distracting from the intensity of the foreground drama, a townscape with a steeple looms in the nocturnal distance,Licht, p. 117. probably including the barracks used by the French.Now the site of the transplanted Nubian temple, the Temple of Debod In the background between the hillside and the shakos is a crowd with torches: perhaps onlookers, perhaps more soldiers or victims. The Second and Third of May 1808 are thought to have been intended as parts of a larger series.Tomlinson, p. 139. Written commentary and circumstantial evidence suggest that Goya painted four large canvases memorializing the rebellion of May 1808. In his memoirs of the Royal Academy in 1867, Jos√© Caveda wrote of four paintings by Goya of the second of May, and Crist√≥bal Ferriz‚Äîan artist and a collector of Goya‚Äîmentioned two other paintings on the theme: a revolt at the royal palace and a defense of artillery barracks. Contemporary prints stand as precedents for such a series. The disappearance of two paintings may indicate official displeasure with the depiction of popular insurrection. =The Disasters of War= Goya's (One cannot look at this) in The Disasters of War (), c. 1810‚Äì1812. This is a very similar composition‚Äîthough Goya was freer in expression in the prints than the paintings, in which he conformed more to traditional conventions.Stoichita, p. 37. Goya's series of aquatint etchings The Disasters of War () was not completed until 1820, although most of the prints were made in the period 1810‚Äì1814. The album of proofs given by Goya to a friend, however, now in the British Museum, provides many indications of the order in which both the preliminary drawings and the prints themselves were composed.There were probably preliminary drawings for all of the prints. The album shows a preliminary numbering system, different from the one Goya finally settled on, which probably relates to the order of composition. For example is no. 15 in the first sequence, and no. 44 in the final sequence. After the earlier no. 19 Goya ran out of good drawing paper from the Netherlands, and began to use whatever he could find. See Bareau, p. 50. The groups identified as the earliest clearly seem to predate the commission for the two paintings, and include two prints with obviously related compositions (illustrated), as well as I saw this, which is presumably a scene witnessed during Goya's trip to Saragossa.Bareau, pp. 49‚Äì50. (One cannot look at this) is clearly related compositionally and thematically;Spivey, pp. 193‚Äì195. the female central figure has her arms outstretched, but pointing down, while another figure has his hands clasped in prayer, and several others shield or hide their faces. This time the soldiers are not visible even from behind; only the bayonets of their guns are seen. (And it cannot be helped) is another of the early prints, from a slightly later group apparently produced at the height of the war when materials were unobtainable, so that Goya had to destroy the plate of an earlier landscape print to make this and another piece in the Disasters series. It shows a shako-wearing firing squad in the background, this time seen receding in a frontal rather than a rear view. =Iconography and invention= Eug√®ne Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People, 1830. A later example of revolutionary art, which retains the idealized and heroic style of history painting that Goya had dramatically broken with. At first the painting met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict war in the high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.Connell, pp. 158‚Äì159. The Third of May references a number of earlier works of art, but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas. Pictorial artifice gives way to the epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary Romantic painters‚Äîwho were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war, and death‚Äîcomposed their paintings with greater attention to the conventions of beauty, as is evident in Th√©odore G√©ricault's Raft of the Medusa (1818‚Äì1819) and Eug√®ne Delacroix's 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People.Licht, p. 124. stigma‚Äîa wound such as Christ suffered when nailed to the cross The painting is structurally and thematically tied to traditions of martyrdom in Christian art, as exemplified in the dramatic use of chiaroscuro, and the appeal to life juxtaposed with the inevitability of imminent execution.Licht, p. 121. However, Goya's painting departs from this tradition. Works that depicted violence, such as those by Jusepe de Ribera, feature an artful technique and harmonious composition which anticipate the \\"crown of martyrdom\\" for the victim.Licht, p. 118. In The Third of May the man with raised arms at the focal point of the composition has often been compared to a crucified Christ,Spivey, p. 195. and a similar pose is sometimes seen in depictions of Christ's nocturnal Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane.Licht, p. 121; including an 1819 painting by Goya. Goya's figure displays stigmata-like marks on his right hand, while the lantern at the center of the canvas references a traditional attribute of the Roman soldiers who arrested Christ in the garden.In depictions since the 12th century, according to Schiller p. 56\\\\. Specifically the man who Saint Peter attacks with a sword often had the lantern, which he drops to the ground when attacked. The scenes of the Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane and the Arrest of Christ were central in the development of the depiction of nocturnal scenes in art. Not only is he posed as if in crucifixion, he wears yellow and white: the heraldic colors of the papacy.Licht, p. 122. Giovanni Battista Tiepolo's 1722 St. Bartholomew is a traditional scene of martyrdom, with the saint beseeching God. Goya drew inspiration from the iconography of such violent scenes. The lantern as a source of illumination in art was widely used by Baroque artists, and perfected by Caravaggio.Licht, p. 119. Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in The Third of May the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted. The victim, as presented by Goya, is as anonymous as his killers. His entreaty is addressed not to God in the manner of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad. He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity as a hallmark of the modern condition. The way the painting shows the progress of time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome is seen in the corpse of a man, splayed on the ground in the lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body. Finally, there is no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's brutality through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme.Licht, pp. 125‚Äì127. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish.Gudiol (1971), p. 171. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality. Provenance Charles IV of Spain and His Family, 1800‚Äì1801. Although Goya had painted many portraits of the House of Bourbon, they did not consider The Third of May 1808 as \\"suitable subject matter\\" for the royal collection. Despite the work's commemorative value, no details about its first exhibition are known, and it is not mentioned in any surviving contemporaneous accounts. This lack of commentary may be due to Fernando VII's preference for neoclassical art,Tomlinson, pp. 137‚Äì139. and to the fact that popular revolts of any kind were not regarded as suitable subject matter by the restored Bourbons. A monument to the fallen in the uprising, also commissioned in 1814 by the provisional government, \\"was stopped by Ferdinand VII, in whose eyes the senators and heroes of the war of independence found small favour, on account of their reforming tendencies\\".Ford, p. 678. According to some accounts of its provenance, the painting lay in storage for thirty to forty years before being shown to the public.Hughes, Robert. \\"The Unflinching Eye \\". The Guardian, October 4, 2003. Retrieved on April 18, 2008. But see also Gautier. Ford, p. 686, mentions only a couple of Goyas in the Prado, and is generally dismissive: \\"he delighted in dirty subjects from which others revolt. Those who admire him should visit his son Don Javier (No. 9, ), who has many of his father's sketches and paintings.\\" Its mention in an 1834 Prado inventory shows that the painting remained in the possession of the government or monarchy; much of the royal collection had been transferred to the museum upon its opening in 1819. Th√©ophile Gautier mentioned seeing \\"a massacre\\" by Goya during a visit to the museum in 1845, and a visitor in 1858 noted it as well, though both accounts refer to the work as depicting the events of the second of May, perhaps because continues to be the Spanish name for the whole episode.The phrase in full is , but this celebrated sequence of events in the nation's history is normally referred to simply as . In 1867, Goya's biographer Charles Emile Yriarte considered the painting important enough to warrant its own special exhibition, but it was not until 1872 that The Third of May was listed in the Prado's published catalog, under the title Scene of the Third of May 1808. Both the Third and Second of May suffered damage in a road accident while being transported by truck to Valencia for safety during the Spanish Civil War,Prado, p. 140. apparently the only time they have left Madrid. Significant paint losses to the left side of the Second of May have been deliberately left unrepaired until the restoration work to both paintings done in 2008 in time for an exhibition marking the bicentennial of the uprising. In 2009, the Prado selected The Third of May 1808 as one of the museum's fourteen most important paintings, to be displayed in Google Earth at a resolution of 14,000 megapixels. Sources Jacques-Louis David's paintings, Oath of the Horatii is considered a likely source for elements of Goya's The Third of May 1808. The most likely sources for The Third of May were popular imagery, prints, and broadsides. Depictions of firing squads were common in Spanish political imagery during the Napoleonic War,Tomlinson, pp. 143‚Äì146. and Goya's appropriations suggest that he envisaged paintings of heroic scale that would appeal to the general public. Miguel Gamborino's 1813 devotional print The Assassination of Five Monks from Valencia is thought to have served as a source for Goya's composition.Connell, p. 158. Points of similarity include a victim in a posture of crucifixion, whose white garment sets him apart from his companions; a tonsured monk with clenched hands who kneels to his left; and an executed corpse lying in the foreground.Hughes, p. 314. The geometry of the composition may be an ironic comment on the French painter Jacques-Louis David's 1784 work Oath of the Horatii. The outstretched arms of David's three Roman Horatii in salute are transmuted into the rifles of the firing squad; the upraised arms of the Horatii's father become the victim's gesture as he faces his executioners. While David painted his figures' expressions with a neoclassical luster, Goya's reply is fashioned from brutal realism.Boime, p. 211. Goya may also have been responding to a painting by Antoine-Jean Gros; the French occupation of Madrid is the subject of Gros's Capitulation of Madrid, The Fourth of December 1808.Honour, Hugh. Romanticism. Westview Press, 1979. p. 376\\\\. Legacy √âdouard Manet's Execution of Emperor Maximilian (1868‚Äì1869), is one of five versions of his representation of the execution of the Austrian-born Emperor of Mexico, which took place on June 19, 1867. Manet borrowed heavily, thematically and technically, from Goya's The Third of May 1808. The first paraphrasing of The Third of May was √âdouard Manet's Execution of Emperor Maximilian,Johnson, Lee.; \\"A New Source for Manet's 'Execution of Maximilian'\\". The Burlington Magazine, Volume 119, Ed. 893, August 1977. pp. 560‚Äì564. painted in several versions between 1867 and 1869. In recording a current event to which neither he nor the emerging art of photography was witness, Manet seems inspired by Goya's precedent. He may have seen the work at the Prado in 1865 before beginning his own paintings, which were too sensitive to be exhibited in France in Manet's lifetime.\\"Manet and the Execution of Maximilian \\". Museum of Modern Art, New York. Retrieved on April 11, 2008. He undoubtedly did see a print of it which was published in 1867 by an acquaintance.Brombert, Beth A. √âdouard Manet: Rebel in a frock coat. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997. p. 216\\\\. Art critic Arthur Danto compares Goya's work and Manet's: > The Third of May also depicts an execution, an early event in the so-called > Peninsular War between France and Spain. Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain in > 1808, capturing its royal family and replacing them with his brother, > Joseph. The French were as unpopular in Spain as they later were in Mexico, > and they encountered a fierce insurrection, which ultimately triumphed.

Picasso. New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1955. p. 302. Aldous Huxley wrote in 1957 that Goya lacked Rubens' ability to fill the canvas with an ordered composition; but he considered The Third of May a success because Goya \\"is speaking in his native language, and he is therefore able to express what he wants to say with maximum force and clarity\\". Kenneth Clark remarked on the painting's radical departure from history painting, and its singular intensity: > With Goya we do not think of the studio or even of the artist at work.

Early life Corday was born in Santa Monica, California. Wanting a career in films, she came to Hollywood while still in her teens and found work as a showgirl at the Earl Carroll Theatre on Sunset Boulevard. Her physical beauty brought jobs as a photographer's model that led to a bit part as a showgirl in the 1951 film Two Tickets to Broadway. Dancing One of Corday's first professional jobs was as a dancer in the Earl Carroll Revue in Hollywood. Accompanied by her mother, Corday auditioned when she was 15 years old. During the two-and-a- half years that she was in the show, she advanced \\"from showgirl to actress in the sketches\\". This was also when she adopted the stage name Mara Corday, because it made her seem more exotic. The name Mara came from a bongo player who called her Marita when Corday was working as an usher at the Mayan Theater; the name Corday was lifted from a bottle of perfume. Film Corday signed with Universal-International Pictures (UI) as a contract player, where she was given small roles in various B-movies and television series. In 1954, while on the set of Playgirl, she met actor and future husband Richard Long. Her acting roles were small until 1955, when she was cast opposite John Agar and Leo G. Carroll in the successful science-fiction film Tarantula, which has Clint Eastwood in a brief role as a jet fighter pilot. She had two other co- starring roles in the genre, The Black Scorpion and The Giant Claw (both 1957), as well as in a number of Western films, including Man Without a Star and Raw Edge. Film critic Leonard Maltin said Corday had \\"more acting ability than she was permitted to exhibit\\". A few years after her husband's death in 1974, Corday's old friend Eastwood offered her a chance to return to films with a role in his 1977 film The Gauntlet. She also had a brief but significant role in Sudden Impact (1983), where she played the waitress who dumped sugar into the coffee of Det. Harry Callahan in that film's iconic \\"Go ahead, make my day\\" sequence. She acted with Eastwood again in his 1989 film Pink Cadillac, as well as in her last film, 1990's The Rookie. Modeling Corday appeared as a pinup girl in numerous men's magazines during the 1950s and was the Playmate of the October 1958 issue of Playboy, along with model Pat Sheehan. Television In 1956, Corday had a recurring role in the ABC television series Combat Sergeant. From 1959 to early 1961, Corday worked exclusively doing guest spots on various television series. She also guest starred with Steve McQueen in Wanted: Dead or Alive in April 1960. Personal life Following the 1955 death of Suzan Ball, the first wife of actor Richard Long, Corday began dating Long, and they married in 1957. Through Long's sister Barbara, Corday was a sister-in-law of actor Marshall Thompson. In the early 1960s, Corday gave up her career to devote herself to raising a family.

The EDS is intended to boost the rocket's payload into a parking orbit around the Earth and from there send the payload out of low Earth orbit to its destination in a manner similar to that of the S-IVB rocket stage used on the Saturn V rockets that propelled the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon. Its development has been put on hold (though not abandoned) until stages capable of transferring heavy payloads to Mars are required (currently expected in the 2030s). Ares V=Design= The EDS used on the cancelled Ares V would have been propelled by a single J-2X main engine fuelled with liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH2), and was to have been designed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama as part of Project Constellation. Originally, the stage would have been based on the Space Shuttle's external tank, and would have used two J-2X engines, while the Ares V core booster would have used five RS-25 engines and two 5-segment Solid Rocket Boosters during the first eight minutes of flight. When the Ares V was then redesigned around the use of five (later sixSPACE.com - NASA Beefs up Next-Generation Moon Rocket) RS-68B rocket engines used on the Delta IV Heavy as of 2019, the EDS was then redesigned using only a single J-2X engine and a common bulkhead, thus in its final design, the EDS resembled an oversized S-IVB, but with the capability of on-site storage (using new propellant storage techniques along with a \\"loiter skirt\\" containing solar panels for electricity) for up to 4 days, something impossible with the old S-IVB. =Mission= Launched on the Ares V rocket, the EDS with its Altair payload would not have become active until the six RS-68 engines cutoff and the Ares V core was jettisoned to burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Upon separation using the on-board staging and ullage motors, the single J-2X engine would then have fired at full thrust to place itself and the Altair into a Low-Earth orbit until it was retrieved, via a separate launch on an Ares I, by the Orion MPCV and its four-person astronaut crew. Once the Orion was docked with the Altair and its systems were checked out, the crew was to jettison the \\"loiter skirt\\" and then fire the J-2X engine for a second time, this time at 80% rated thrust, for Trans Lunar Injection (TLI). Unlike the S-IVB, which propelled the Apollo Spacecraft and its three-man crew in a forward-facing motion, the EDS would have fired its onboard rocket with the crew facing the EDS. This \\"eyeballs out\\" type of flying would be similar to the flight profile of the proposed, but never flown Manned Venus Flyby, from the cancelled Apollo Applications Program of the late 1960s. When TLI was completed and the EDS was shut down for the last time, it would then have been jettisoned to fly into a heliocentric orbit, or in a manner similar to that employed by NASA from Apollo 13 to Apollo 17, it may have been deliberately crashed into the lunar surface to help scientists calibrate sensitive seismometers placed on the lunar surface by either astronauts on lunar sortie flights or by uncrewed robotic probes. Space Launch System When the Ares program was cancelled in favor of the Space Launch System, the EDS was considered as a second stage for the Block 1B SLS. This version of the stage would have been about long and equipped with one to three J-2X engines. Technological development of the J-2X was expected to take considerably more time, so the EDS was dropped in favor of the Exploration Upper Stage, which will use the much lower-thrust but already-developed RL10. According to NASA, the J-2X will be overpowered for the Artemis program; its development has been put on hold (though not abandoned) until stages capable of transferring heavy payloads to Mars are required (expected in the 2030s).

The team has appeared in 3 self-titled miniseries: Team 7, Team 7: Objective Hell and Team 7: Dead Reckoning. The first 5-issue Gen¬π¬≥ limited series also involved members of Team 7. The team's members have played a major role throughout the Wildstorm Universe. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity, bringing in Wildstorm characters, including Team 7. Publication history Team 7 debuted in a self-titled four-issue limited series, published in 1994‚Äì95. Writer Brandon Choi remarked on this mini-series that \\"I really enjoyed [writer] Chuck Dixon's portrayal of the team members, especially Cole. He really wove Cole's background into the whole Team 7 story in a very believable fashion.\\" The team was featured in the series Wetworks. A new ongoing series about the group was announced by DC in June 2012.\\"DC Comics Announces New 52 'Zero Month,' 4 New Titles\\", MTV Geek It began with a \\"#0\\" issue in November, and ended with a \\"#8\\" issue in July 2013. The series was written by Justin Jordan and illustrated by an assortment of artists. Set five years in the past during the emergence of superheroes, the group's membership consists of a combination of DCU and Wildstorm characters: Dinah Drake, Amanda Waller, Kurt Lance, Summer Ramos, James Bronson, Dean Higgins, John Lynch, Alex Fairchild, Cole Cash, and Slade Wilson. Fictional biography Team 7 was officially the seventh incarnation of a group of military specialists gathered from various government forces (a Team Zero was later revealed, making Team 7 the group's eighth incarnation). Team 7 took its orders from Miles Craven, director of International Operations. Craven wanted his own army of superhumans, and therefore dropped a chemical known as the \\"Gen-factor\\" on the members of Team 7 during a (suicide) mission. When they awoke from their Gen-factor induced comas, Team 7 was told that the enemy had dropped a chemical weapon on them. As a result of the Gen-factor, Team 7 (except for Michael Cray) started to develop superhuman powers. It would be years before Cray himself would develop similar abilities. Team 7 member Cole Cash distrusted Craven and suspected that he was behind the experiment. Several members of Team 7 were unable to cope with their new powers and went mad or committed suicide. At least one had to be shot during a subsequent mission. As a test, Craven dropped a \\"low-yield nuke\\" on Team 7. The members survived through co-operation and went into hiding.Team 7 #1‚Äì4 (October 1994‚ÄìFebruary 1995) Sometime later, Team 7 returned to work for I.O. and were sent to destroy a cache of nuclear weapons from Cambodia before the Khmer Rouge could get them. The team succeeded, but learned that a pair of Soviet superhumans were trailing them. They battled them, but they turned out to be too strong and Jackson Dane went into a coma. The Cambodian blind girl X'ing X'iang, who had displayed superhuman mental powers before, overpowered one of the Soviet agents, while Michael Cray shot the other one. The team returned to the U.S. and took X'ing X'iang with them.Team 7: Objective Hell #1‚Äì3 (May 1995‚ÄìJuly 1995) Years later, the Team 7 members were ordered to bring in the Soviet scientist, Dbovchek. Cole Cash entered the Soviet Union on his own to find out more about Dbovchek while the rest of the team went on the mission. Dbovchek turned out to be one of the main scientists behind the Russian psionic program. The mission turned out to be a failure; Dbovchek was killed and Cash was captured. Cash discovers that his mental powers were waning, but John Lynch saved him. Back in the U.S., Jackson Dane awoke from his coma under the influence of International Operations. Dane's powers turned out to be far stronger than the rest of Team 7 combined, but Cray brought in X'ing X'iang who freed Dane. She found out through Dane that Miles Craven had become interested in the children of Team 7, so most Team 7 members took their families and went into hiding. This would turn out to be the end of Team 7, though most members would stay in contact and occasionally reunite.Team 7: Dead Reckoning #1‚Äì4 (January 1996‚ÄìApril 1996) Jackson Dane would lead a new Team 7 years later. =DC Universe= After the events of the Flashpoint limited series, the Wildstorm universe was assimilated into the DC Universe as seen in 2011's launch of The New 52. In this timeline, Team 7 was assembled by John Lynch, to prevent future metahuman threats. Members like Black Canary, Deathstroke, and Grifter gained their superpowers while working in the team.

It offers a number of recreational attractions like bike trails, skateboarding, and fishing. History This Miami-Dade County regional park was the southern undeveloped portion of decades old Naval Air Station Miami. It was never an airport and never part of the City of Miami- owned Miami Municipal Airport which was on the east side of LeJeune Road and south of NW 119th Street (E. 65th Street) in Hialeah. Amelia Earhart's last ill-fated trip around the world flight left from Miami Municipal Airport in 1937 en route to San Juan, PR, and then south from there and across the Atlantic to Africa. Miami Municipal Airport was renamed Amelia Earhart Field in October 1947. When the Navy discontinued operations at Naval Air Station Miami the U. S. Marine Corps moved to the Navy property from Master Field, another large airport on NW 27th Avenue, east of Amelia Earhart Field . Marine Corps Air Station Miami only operated a couple of years before the Marines shut it down. The federal government's General Services Administration was then charged with disposition of the property and they granted a Dade County bid to assume ownership of the air station's existing airport facilities except for a portion reserved for the U. S. Coast Guard's Air Station Miami. The county named the airport \\"Opa-locka Airport\\" due to the name of the city immediately east of the airport. Community leaders, notably Bill Graham (dairy farmer and developer of the Miami Lakes community) successfully lobbied the federal government to be granted about half of the property on the southern portion of the former Naval Air Station, extending from LeJeune Road westward to approximately W. 2nd Avenue in Hialeah, to be given to the county for a large regional park. The remaining southern portion of undeveloped air station land was auctioned off to private developers west and north of Amelia Earhart Regional Park. Amelia Earhart's Farm Village is named after Bill Graham, son of former state senator Ernest R. \\"Cap\\" Graham, and the developer of the Miami Lakes residential and commercial development west of Opa-locka Executive Airport. Facilities The park offers of bike trails. They include single track and fire road trails with a number of climbs, downhills, and banked corners. The Bill Graham Farm Village is a farm replica featuring a demonstration shed where visitors can watch horseshoeing, cow-milking, livestock judging and sheep shearing, as well as a petting zoo, exhibit hall, sugar cane press and pony ring. Near the barn is a country store and an adjoining insect museum. There is fenced, dog park, an 18-hole disc golf course, and other amenities which include paved walkways, playgrounds, benches, shade trees, waste dispenser stations.

Loewen, a sociologist. It critically examines twelve popular American high school history textbooks and concludes that the textbook authors propagate false, Eurocentric and mythologized views of American history. In addition to his critique of the dominant historical themes presented in high school textbooks, Loewen presents themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. Themes In Lies My Teacher Told Me, Loewen criticizes modern American high school history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people and events such as Christopher Columbus, the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the Native Americans, and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their \\"bland\\" and simplistic style. He proposes that when American history textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of heroes, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history- as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.Loewen, James.

This album features a rather significant style variation. Retreating from the Nichole Nordeman or Joy Williams style, St. James has taken on a more rock-driven anthem (similar to secular acts Evanescence and Alanis Morissette). However, even in the particularly edgy \\"Alive\\", Rebecca St. James never deviates from the Christian message that has driven all her songs from the beginning. The album includes the hit singles \\"Alive\\" and \\"You Are Loved\\". Writing and development St. James co-wrote 11 out of the 12 tracks on the album, with the songs \\"God Help Me\\" and \\"You Are Loved\\" being written solely by the singer. St. James wrote \\"God Help Me\\" on her 27th birthday and says of the song, \\"I love singing this song because to me it‚Äôs an essential thought of the Christian life... 'God help me... I‚Äôm not enough!'\\" The album's first single, \\"Alive\\", is about how God can refresh you. She commented, \\"I love that this song is the first single from the album because it really represents where I am in my life right now. I feel over the last few years that God has really refreshed my soul. He‚Äôs done a lot of work in me personally in just re-vitalizing me as well as re-energizing me in a musical/ministry sense.\\" The title song \\"You Are Loved\\" was inspired by an old family friend. St. James says, \\"This is a song that‚Äôs very close to me. It‚Äôs written about a childhood friend of mine that I grew up with in Sydney. I fell out of contact with him after leaving our Christian school to move to a different state. I ran into a mutual friend years later and asked how our friend, Daniel, was doing. This friend told me that Daniel had really fallen away from God and that he‚Äôd been abusing drugs as well. As I was thinking about what I wanted to write about on this album, he very randomly came to mind‚Äîand I felt that this ‚Äòrandom‚Äô thought was actually placed there by God. I had the concept... 'If I had one chance to tell Daniel something, what would I say to him?‚Äô The message I felt God really laid on my heart was to tell him... 'You are loved.' This is a song for the prodigals‚Äîwhich is all of us. God is the father that has His arms open wide waiting for us. He wants us to run towards Him and He will run toward us. It‚Äôs a song of hope and a message my generation needs to hear. ‚ÄòNo matter where you've been and what you've done... you are loved.' From this song came the album title‚Äîand really the key theme of the project. I think I‚Äôve come to realize, yes, we need to stand in awe of God and be blown away by His power. But it‚Äôs really His kindness and His love that draws us to Him and into a relationship with Him‚ÄîHis love makes us desire to know Him and love Him in return. That is for me the most important message I need to share‚Äîthrough this album and in my life. From how I relate in my relationships with others to what I say onstage ‚Äìthe message is 'we are extravagantly loved by God'\\". \\"Shadowlands\\" was inspired by the writings of C.S. Lewis, while \\"Love Being Loved By You\\" is described by St. James as a worship song. \\"I Need You\\" was written for St. James's best friend Karleen. \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" is described by the singer as her \\"Compassion International song\\". She says, \\"For years I have wanted to write a song that sums up my heart for the work of Compassion International‚Äîand this is it‚Äîit arrived! Ever since I was a little girl and wanted to work in an orphanage and help kids in need, I‚Äôve had a passion to show God‚Äôs love in practical ways. I think this song challenges me‚Äîand hopefully it challenges the listener‚Äîto not ignore those that we experience in our day-to-day lives who are hurting. I want this song to encourage people to reach out in the sense of reaching those who are hurting all around us. To offer God‚Äôs help and hope to those who are struggling with all kinds of needs - from poverty to loneliness, and to give to those that too often are lost and unnoticed in the crowd. What the song challenges us to do is to see that person as if we‚Äôre truly seeing Jesus ‚Äìwhen we someone, we are loving Him. I am personally challenged by this song when I sing it and that‚Äôs a good thing.\\" Co-written and co-sung by TobyMac, \\"Thank You\\" is a simple message of thanks to God. The song \\"Take All of Me\\" was originally written by Hillsong United artist Marty Sampson and was chosen by St. James because of its worshipful tone. St. James says of \\"Forgive Me\\", \\"This song reminds me of the everlasting beauty of God‚Äôs grace.\\" The song \\"I Can Trust You\\" was written as a reminder to trust God. St. James says, \\"A major dream for me has been to get married and have a family‚Äîso this song really challenges me. God called me to trust Him with my desire to be married. To say, ‚ÄúLord, if you have another purpose for me other than this desire that I have, I choose to trust you that you know what‚Äôs best for my life.‚Äô He gave me the ability to do this. This song really talks about the challenges of giving God the things closest to us.\\" St. James says of the final track, \\"Lest I Forget\\", \\"It‚Äôs somewhat of a sobering song but a song of gratefulness that simply treasures what Jesus has done for us.\\" Music structure If I Had One Chance To Tell You Something is described as \\"commercial alternative rock\\". It is much edgier and rock-based than St. James' prior album Worship God. The songs are based in guitars, bass lines, and string arrangements. St. James also dabbles in hip-hop on the track \\"Thank You\\". The album was produced by frequent Rebecca St. James collaborators Tedd T. and Matt Bronleewe, and producer Shaun Shankel.

Rob Theakston of Allmusic gave the album 3 out of 5 stars and said \\"the music is so contemporary and the lyrics sometimes so ambiguous, it's easy to forget where her message is coming from and what it's all about.\\" JesusFreakHideout gave it 4 stars and commented, \\"If I Had One Chance To Tell You Something is a wonderful addition to Rebecca St. James's impressive career. Pop/rock and RSJ fans alike should find a lot to enjoy about this record, and it's a real treat to hear her return to the type of music-making that caused us to fall in love with her a decade ago.\\" ChristianityToday favored the album saying, \\"This album's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, and you can bet that as much as half of If I Had One Chance will do well on Christian radio. The challenge will be for St. James will be to avoid reverting to old material, continuing to press forward and try new things in her words and music. Nevertheless, this is a great recovery from her songwriting hiatus. Rebecca St. James is back, as inviting and rocking as she ever was.\\" =Chart performance= The album was not as successful as her previous endeavors and was her first studio album to not reach the Billboard 200 in 11 years.

The film and its soundtrack are dedicated to the memory of music producer J Dilla who died of lupus one month before the film's release. The film was officially released at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. The film grossed $12.1 million in the box office and debuted at #6 in its opening weekend, grossing $6 million in 1,200 theaters. Plot The Broken Angel House, the site of the documentary, in May, 2007 The film follows Chappelle during the summer of 2004, ending on September 18, 2004, when he threw a block party on the corner of Quincy Street and Downing Street in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City. The film features nearby sites, including the Broken Angel House in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn as well as areas in Fort Greene, Brooklyn and Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. The film was produced before Chappelle's highly publicized decision to walk away from a $50 million deal to continue his hit Chappelle's Show, and gained prominence after the announcement. Chappelle invited several hip hop and neo-soul musical artists to perform at the party, including Kanye West, Mos Def, Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, and The Roots along with The Central State University Marching Band. Lauryn Hill was also scheduled to perform at the party, but since Columbia Records refused to release her songs for use in the production, she decided instead to reunite The Fugees for the occasion. In addition, Chappelle performed comedy monologues and sketches in between the musical acts.

She served as Los Angeles City Controller from 2009‚Äì13. Greuel was the second woman elected to citywide office in Los Angeles, after her predecessor Laura Chick. Previously, she served as a member of the Los Angeles City Council from 2002‚Äì09, where she served as President Pro Tempore and represented the 2nd District, which includes portions of the San Fernando Valley. Greuel was a candidate for Mayor of Los Angeles in 2013, losing to Eric Garcetti, followed by a loss running for California's 33rd congressional district. She was the first woman to advance to a Los Angeles mayoral runoff, performing better than previous female candidates Linda Griego in 1993, Kathleen Connell in 2001 and Jan Perry also in 2013. Early and career She was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley, the daughter of a Christian church founder.Jewish Daily Forward: \\"Would-Be L.A. Mayor Seeks Jewish Votes - In Race With Jews, Wendy Greuel Notes She Married Into Faith\\" By Rex Weiner January 29, 2012 Greuel graduated from Kennedy High School and served as student body president. During high school, she served as a member of then-Mayor Tom Bradley's Youth Council. She continued her education at the University of California, Los Angeles, during which time she interned for Councilman Joel Wachs, Mayor Tom Bradley and the City of Los Angeles's office in Washington DC. =Office of Mayor Tom Bradley= Upon graduation, Greuel worked in Mayor Bradley's office for ten years, serving as Bradley's liaison to the City Council, city departments, and the community on public policy issues ranging from child care to homelessness to senior care and health issues. During this time, she established the city's first AIDS coordinator, secured funding from the City Council for condoms and bleach to stop the spread of AIDS, worked to find housing for L.A.'s homeless population, including Vietnam War veterans, and helped to create LA's Best, a nationally recognized after-school program for public elementary school students. =Clinton Administration= From 1993-97, Greuel worked in the administration of President Bill Clinton. She served with Housing and Urban Development Cabinet Secretaries Henry Cisneros and Andrew Cuomo, first as the Deputy Director of the Interagency Council on Homelessness and later as the field operations officer for Southern California, where she became involved in projects offering opportunities for home ownership, job creation, economic development and social services. During her tenure, she managed HUD's response to the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which included securing over $1 billion in federal funding for recovery efforts. =DreamWorks= From 1997 to 2002, Greuel worked as an executive in government and community affairs for DreamWorks SKG, an entertainment studio in Los Angeles. City Council In 2002, Greuel won a runoff election against Assemblyman Tony Cardenas to fill the remainder of the term of second district Los Angeles Councilman Joel Wachs. She was elected to a full term in 2003 and re-elected in 2007. She served until July 2009, when she was elected to the office of City Controller. At the time of her departure from the City Council, she was President Pro Tempore, chair of the Transportation Committee and Ad- Hoc Committee on Business Tax Reform, vice chair of the Budget and Finance Committee, and member of the Audits and Governmental Efficiency and Energy and Environment Committees. As Chair of the Transportation Committee, Greuel added 450 left-turn signals to city streets and led a program to synchronize city traffic lights. She also banned road construction during rush hour and created anti-gridlock zones throughout the city to prevent motorists from parking on major thoroughfares during rush hour. As Chair of the Ad-Hoc Committee on Business Tax Reform, she implemented a business tax reform proposal in 2003 that reduced business taxes by 15% overall, eliminated all business taxes for companies with gross receipts under $100,000 annually and has returned nearly $100 million to local small businesses. As a member of the Energy and Environment Committee, Greuel preserved nearly 1,200 acres of open space, including securing funding to purchase 225 acres in the Verdugo Mountains to create the sixth largest passive park in the city. She championed the Scenic Preservation Corridor Plan, which prevents development along the Verdugo's ridge lines. Greuel banned smoking in farmers markets and proposed that all new buildings be wired for solar technology. Through her position on the Audits and Governmental Efficiency Committee, Greuel helped establish the Office of Public Safety in 2004, which consolidated all city-operated security forces (other than the LAPD) and created the Police Fund, a program through which any elected official could address inefficiencies and allocate the money saved to the hiring of new police officers. She developed the Stolen Vehicle Recovery Program, which enabled Department of Transportation officers (rather than police officers) to tow stolen vehicles, allowing police officers more time to respond to violent crime. Greuel also implemented the 50/50 sidewalk program, expediting sidewalk repairs when neighbors contributed 50% of the cost, created the Waste, Fraud, and Abuse Investigative Unit in the City Controller's office and banned political fundraising among City Commissioners. Greuel launched a district-wide anti-graffiti campaign and pushed to increase the number of neighborhood watch organizations in her district. She also implemented a safety valet program designed to ensure that all elementary school students were supervised entering and exiting schools. In 2004, Greuel was an instrumental part of a major controversy in a neighborhood in her district when she chose to close a pedestrian bridge. There was a dispute between homeowners on the north side of the Los Angeles River and renters on the south side. Parking was an issue for the renters; they would use the north side neighborhood as overflow parking and cross the pedestrian bridge to their homes. Without any warning, the bridge was closed in 2005. The renters called for a town hall meeting, after which the bridge remained closed. The LAPD then became involved, saying they would close the bridge for 90 days to see if crime rates (the reason the homeowners cited to close the bridge) were affected. Near the end of the trial period, another town hall meeting was called and the officer in charge said that there was no significant change in the crime rates on the north side of the bridge. In the days before the final recommendation from the LAPD was to be released, this officer was discharged from the case and another officer was put in charge. This second officer recommended the bridge be closed for unknown reasons. This remains a point of contention in the renters' neighborhood, as parking is sparse and residents often have to walk blocks to get home while the bridge remains closed. Greuel stayed adamant that the decision to close the bridge was about crime, not parking: \\"We've received a variety of complaints from people on the bridge side of graffiti, vandalism, drug sales.\\" The police study during those 90 days, however, refuted those claims. City Controller Greuel defeated Nick Patsaouras and Kathleen Suzy Evans on March 3, 2009 to become the City Controller of Los Angeles. She took office on July 1, 2009. =Audit record= By the end of her four-year term, Greuel's office claimed that she had identified over $160 million in waste, fraud and abuse. This assertion emerged as an issue during her 2013 mayoral campaign when her opponent Eric Garcetti argued that the amount was misleading as only several million dollars had actually been recovered. Greuel responded that she had in fact identified over $160 million but that the responsibility for recovering the money belonged to the Mayor and City Council. In November 2009 and through a follow-up audit in November 2011, Greuel tracked the progress of the LAPD's backlog of untested rape kits. While the department made significant progress in reducing the backlog, Greuel made a series of recommendations to ensure future rape kits would not sit untested on the department's shelves.http://www.lacp.org/2009-Articles-Main/110509-DNARapeKitBacklog- Greuel.htm In November 2011, Greuel expanded the city's Waste, Fraud, and Abuse hotline to accommodate whistleblower tips in more than 150 languages. A tip in 2012 led to Greuel's audit of the Department of Recreation and Parks that found that the city had spent $2 million to house caretakers at two of its remote camps that had been closed for thirteen and twenty years, respectively. In October 2011, Greuel called for the city to transition to performance based budgeting, a system that requires departments to plan based on specific goals, rather than the line-item budgeting being used. Mayor Eric Garcetti adopted Greuel's recommendation when developing his first budget for Fiscal Year 2014.http://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2011/11-1702_rpt_ctrl_10-5-11.pdfhttp://www.dailynews.com/government- and-politics/20140209/tipoff-garcetti-down-to-the-nitty-gritty-on-budget-preps In May 2011, Greuel audited the city's cell phone use and found that the city wasted as much as $1 million annually by overpaying cellphone carriers and maintaining hundreds of phones that were not in use for months at a time, among other practices. In October 2010, then-City Attorney Carmen Trutanich announced a series of reforms to the workers compensation unit in his office after Greuel uncovered that the unit took too long to settle cases and failed to collect millions of dollars it was due. In 2008, Greuel's predecessor, Controller Laura N. Chick had attempted to audit then-City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo's workers compensation unit; however, when Chick issued subpoenas to six of his employees, he sued to block her efforts. Greuel and Trutanich inherited the lawsuit; when a judge ruled in favor of the City Attorney, Greuel appealed the decision, arguing that the City Controller should have the authority to audit all city departments, including elected officials. In October 2011, an appeals court neglected to say whether elected officials could be audited. Also in October 2010, Greuel penned an op-ed in The Nation with then-Public Advocate, current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio blasting the Citizens United decision and announcing that they had joined with leaders from other states to found the Coalition for Accountability in Political Spending to encourage corporations to be transparent about their political spending.http://www.thenation.com/article/155432/corporations-hide-election- spending-public-eye# In August 2010, in the aftermath of the pay scandal in the City of Bell, Greuel unveiled a comprehensive list of city employee salaries on her website, making Los Angeles the largest city in the United States to make this information public. In July 2010, Greuel reported in one of her audits that the City of Los Angeles had failed to collect over $260 million in traffic tickets and other debts owed to the city, 47% of all debts. In July 2009, Greuel announced that her Delinquent Taxpayer Program had successfully collected nearly $3 million from 16 delinquent taxpayers in just four months. She stated that over $107 million in delinquent taxes was still to be collected. =Calendar controversy= On January 7, 2013, the Los Cerritos News published Greuel's public schedule since taking office as Los Angeles City Controller. The article alleged that \\"she has spent an overwhelming majority of her official schedule for the past three years attending lavish dinners, lunches, breakfasts, and social events in an effort to advance her 2013 mayoral campaign\\" in possible violation of the Los Angeles Governmental Ethics Commission Ordinance.Randy Economy, \\"Wendy Greul's Official Calendar Shows Years of Campaigning for Mayor on Taxpayer's Dollar 2013 mayoral campaign Greuel was a candidate for Mayor of Los Angeles in the 2013 election. In the primary election, she placed second to Eric Garcetti and came ahead of Jan Perry, Kevin James and Emanuel Pleitez, thereby advancing to the runoff. Her candidacy was endorsed by a number of public officials including former President Bill Clinton, former Mayor Richard Riordan, LA County Supervisors Gloria Molina and Mark Ridley-Thomas, State Assembly Speaker John Perez and former Speaker Bob Hertzberg and labor leader Dolores Huerta. She ultimately lost the general election to Eric Garcetti, who became Mayor on July 1, 2013. Had she been elected, Greuel would have been the city's first woman Mayor. She was the first woman to advance to a Los Angeles mayoral runoff, performing better than previous female candidates Linda Griego in 1993, Kathleen Connell in 2001 and Jan Perry in 2013. After the election, Greuel was viewed as a potentially formidable candidate to replace outgoing LA County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.

Campaigning on the perceived need for change after 23 years of conservative (Liberal-Country Party coalition) government, Labor put forward a raft of major policy proposals, accompanied by a television advertising campaign of prominent celebrities singing a jingle entitled \\"It's Time\\". It was ultimately successful, as Labor picked up eight seats and won a majority. This was the first time Labor had been in government since it lost the 1949 election to the Liberal Party. Origins In the 1969 federal election, the endorsed ALP candidate for the blue-ribbon Liberal seat of Ryan, John Conn, then a lecturer at the University of Queensland, had employed a highly successful door-to-door campaign. For this, he had devised a pamphlet headed: 'It's Time for a Change' followed by a dot-point list of reasons, including education, the war in Vietnam, urban renewal, etc. He managed a swing of 19 per cent, by far the biggest in Queensland, forcing the incumbent, Nigel Drury, to DLP preferences for the first time. Soon afterwards, at a post- election occasion in Brisbane, John Conn was approached and congratulated by Gough Whitlam and Mick Young together. They enquired about the likely reasons for the successful local campaign. John Conn gave each of them a copy of his pamphlet. Mick Young asked if Labor could expect to see a similar effort in 1972. He was told yes but that a shorter, snappier version, 'It's time ...', might be more effective for the next campaign. The originator of the idea heard no more about it until the revamped slogan re-emerged in 1972. John Conn ran again for Ryan in 1972, gaining a further swing but not quite enough to win. Campaign The slogan \\"It's Time\\", around which the three-stage campaign was built, was conceived by Paul Jones, at the time creative director at Sydney ad agency Hansen-Rubensohn‚ÄìMcCann-Erickson which was handling ALP's advertising account.'It's Time' to 'Rock on' Paul Campaign Brief, 8 February 2007Patricia Amphlett: Timely campaign signalled start of Whitlam's cultural sea change The Sydney Morning Herald, 12 November 2012 The goal of the campaign's first stage was to popularise the phrase while the television commercial served as the core element of the second stage. Conceived by Jones, copywriter Ade Casey (then known as Adrienne Dames) and art director Rob Dames, it was directed by Ric Kabriel and produced through Fontana Films, Sydney. The song was written by Jones and advertising jingle writer Mike Shirley, it was arranged as well as produced by Pat Aulton. Lead singer Alison McCallum laid down the foundation track at ATA Studios, Sydney. The chorus comprising a \\"Who's Who\\" of Australian entertainment and sport personalities, including Tony Barber, Barry Crocker, Lynette Curran, Chuck Faulkner, Jimmy Hannan, Brian Henderson, Col Joye, Graham Kennedy, Dawn Lake, Bobby Limb, Little Pattie, Bert Newton, Terry Norris, Hazel Phillips, Judy Stone, Maggie Tabberer, Jack Thompson, Jacki Weaver, Kevin Sanders, Ade and Rob Dames, among others, was recorded one day in early spring at either the Hordern Pavilion or Supreme Sound in Sydney's Paddington with Joye conducting. The TV spot mainly shows McCallum and the other singers performing the song, intercut are pictures from Whitlam's private photo collection. As well as reaching its target demographic‚Äîloosely speaking, women and young people‚Äî, \\"the ad reached a far wider and probably quite unexpected segment of the electorate.\\" =Launch= The It's Time campaign was first launched in Blacktown, New South Wales in 1972. According to Whitlam himself, Blacktown was chosen because it \\"represented - symbolised even - the new outer suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane where we were building a new constituency. It typified all the urban policy failures of the time, through lack of planning and misallocation of resources at both Federal and State government level.\\"Speech at Blacktown Expo Opening, 16 September 1993 The launch at Blacktown is generally seen as the beginning of the end for the Liberal Party led by William McMahon. The speech that Gough Whitlam delivered to the audience in the Blacktown Civic Centre was written for the Labor Party by Graham Freudenberg, the advisor and speech writer to several successive Labor governments. =Themes and policies= The campaign concentrated heavily on the mistakes made by the prime minister of the day, William McMahon, with a special focus given to the areas of the national economy, health care, city planning and the Vietnam War, as well as Whitlam's ideas for governmental reform. Economic policy Whitlam put forward an economic plan as part of his It's Time speech that advocated strong, productive relationships between the public, industry and employees. He contended that only if strong economic growth was maintained, would policies in other areas be feasible. A restoration of genuine full employment along with a projected 6-7% growth of industry were predicted. He argued that his government need not increase taxation to achieve its goals. Health care reforms The Labor party planned to introduce a universal health insurance scheme, to which contributions would be made according to income, thus turning the old system on its head. Gough Whitlam declared that the Labor party would set up an Australian Hospitals Commission to promote the modernisation and regionalisation of hospitals. The Commission would be concerned with more than just hospital services. Its concern and financial support would extend to the development of community-based health services and the sponsoring of preventative health programs. Labour encouraged sponsoring public nursing homes, and development of community health clinics. City planning Labor under Whitlam proposed co-operation with the States, local government and semi-government authorities in a major effort to reduce land and housing costs, and to retard rises in rates and local government charges. To this end they advocated the establishment of a new Ministry of Urban Affairs to analyse, research and co-ordinate plans for each city and region and to advise the Federal Government on grants for urban purposes. Whitlam claimed that the average cost of housing could be reduced by up to 20% by merely standardizing the reticulation and building and lending authority regulations. He also sought to lower interest payments by making them tax deductible. Labor committed itself to reducing the waiting time for a commission home to under twelve months. Vietnam War Whitlam promised an end to Australian involvement in the war in Vietnam and an end to conscription into the Australian armed forces. He underscored the relevance of treaties such as ANZUS to the defence of Australia, but also noted that beginning serious relations with China was in the country's best interest. It was also announced that all of those previously imprisoned under the National Service Act would be released. Social justice Whitlam asserted that education was to be the fastest-growing public sector in Australia, should Labor gain power. In furtherance of this goal, he proposed the establishment of an Australian Schools Commission to examine and determine the needs of students in Government and non-government primary, secondary and technical schools. He promised to increase funding to schools, and to allocate it based on need, accusing his predecessor of having neglected some schools in favour of more prestigious ones. Whitlam announced that pre-school education would be paid for by the state, and that child care would be heavily subsidised under a Labor government. He also said that university fees would be abolished from 1974. The ALP saw a great weakness in Australian social welfare in that it relied almost wholly on the provision of cash benefits. Whitlam said he would establish an Australian Assistance Plan with the emphasis on providing social workers to provide advice, counselling and above all the sheer human contact that the under-privileged in the community needed. He also sought to unify the different social justice systems that were in place at that time. Under Labor, the pension rate would be raised to 25% of the average Australian male's earnings. Political climate=Leadership= By 1972 Australia had been governed by the Liberal-Country coalition for 23 years. However, the Coalition had barely avoided a humiliating defeat when it suffered an 18-seat swing in the 1969 election campaign‚Äîone of the largest swings against a government that still managed to keep power. Labor actually won a majority of the two-party vote; had it been able to overcome DLP preferences in four Melbourne-area seats, Whitlam would have become Prime Minister. After the election, Liberal Prime Minister John Gorton was unable to get the better of Whitlam. Over the next two years, the Coalition fell further behind Labor in the polls, and Gorton resigned in 1971 after a tied vote of no confidence in the Liberal caucus. However, his successor, William McMahon, was indecisive, and failed to deliver on many of the Coalition's campaign promises. McMahon was also unable to get the better of Whitlam; his skills as an orator were no match for Whitlam's abilities. One of his own most cited quotes pointed out his indecisive nature. =Foreign relations= The Coalition had focused heavily on relations with the United States since the Second World War to bring Australia under their defence umbrella. Under the auspices of ANZUS, Australia had sent over fifty thousand troops to Vietnam in support of the South Vietnamese forces. The Australian government did not recognise the sovereignty of several communist bloc states including the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China. Apartheid in South Africa was becoming a huge source of controversy, and there was wide public support in Australia to increase sanctions against the white government there, particularly with respect to their sports teams. =Economy= Unemployment was 2.5% and inflation was sitting on 6.1%. The Australian Dollar bought 1.93 US Dollars, 362 Yen or 1.97 Pounds Sterling. A general downturn in the western economies of the world, and the rising price of oil were contributing to a poor financial situation for Australia. Success Labor received 49.7 per cent of the primary vote, leaving the Liberal-Country Party coalition with just 41.4 per cent. Labor, with 67 of 125 seats in the House of Representatives, now controlled Australia's lower house of Parliament by a margin of nine seats. The overall swing to Labor on 2 December was 2.5 per cent. Labor lost four seats while gaining twelve. The 1972 election was the first ALP victory since 1946. Its success is usually attributed to both the It's Time campaign, and Whitlam's skills as an orator, though Graham Freudenberg had a major influence on many speeches given by members of the ALP during the It's Time campaign. The campaign helped the ALP to establish new voter constituencies, particularly in outer lying areas of Australia's major population centres, who until then were to a large extent marginalised by the major parties. On his first day in office as Prime Minister of Australia, Whitlam declared an end to conscription and began arranging for those imprisoned for avoiding the draft to be released and compensated. During the next few weeks he implemented a range of new measures including the establishment of an Australian honours system and the banning of racially selected sporting teams, a move intended to impede the South African Apartheid policy. East Germany and the People's Republic of China were also recognised for the first time by an Australian government. Reforms During its time in office, the Whitlam Government embarked on an ambitious program of social reform in keeping with the promise of change that the ALP campaign emphasised. The social radicalism of the Whitlam Government was such that, during its first thirteen days in office, some forty important decisions had been made.The death of social democracy: political consequences in the 21st century by Ashley Lavelle As noted by one historian, \\"Labor‚Äôs extensive reforms during its first term in office were the high water mark of Australian postwar social democracy.\\"Labor's Conflict: Big Business, Workers and the Politics of Class by Tom Bramble and Rick Kuhn On coming to office, the Whitlam Government granted federal public servants paid maternity leave, a thirty-six-and-a-quarter-hour workweek, large wage rises and four weeks annual leave. Free tertiary education was introduced, together with a universal health care system and a sole parent pension. Laws were also passed providing for equal pay for women and national land rights, divorce laws were made more liberal, and legislation against racial discrimination was introduced. In addition, the principle of equal pay was extended, occupational health and safety was improved, annual leave loading was introduced, trade union education was established, four weeks of annual leave was achieved as a national standard,hawke government. military conscription was abolished and Australian troops were withdrawn from Vietnam, a separate ministry responsible for Aboriginal affairs was established, controls on foreign ownership of Australian resources were put in place, laws against sexual discrimination were passed, maternity leave and benefits for single mothers were extended, an attempt was made to democratise the electoral system through the introduction of one-vote-one-value, and a Community Health Program was introduced. The social services were also significantly expanded, with big improvements in the real value of social security payments,https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/05_2012/no.6.pdf spending on housing quadrupled, education outlays doubled, and federal health expenditure rising by 20% A Department of Aboriginal Affairs was also established, while Australia's first federal legislation on human rights, the environment and heritage was initiated.http://static.moadoph.gov.au/ophgovau/media/images/apmc/docs/21-Whitlam- Web.pdf A significant amount of legislation was passed altogether from 1972 to 1975, with 221 acts passed by parliament in 1973 alone,Australia's Prime Ministers: From Barton to Howard by Brian Carroll while the welfare state was significantly extended.http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/EBDEF85F8B618262CA2573A9001E1BA5/$File/13010_1974_chapter13.pdf Public spending was raised significantly, with the 1973 budget quadrupling spending on housing, tripling outlays on urban development, and doubling spending on education. Through initiatives such as the Australian Assistance Plan and the Regional Employment Development scheme, employment opportunities were expanded and funds allocated towards improving services and amenities in deprived areas, as characterised by the construction of new health centres, community houses, legal services, footpaths, sewers, streetlights, and public libraries. In 1978, one observer praised the Australian Assistance Plan for generating ‚Äúmuch more general acceptance of the concepts of welfare for the community and local participation. Moreover, a great deal had actually happened. During the year 1975-76, 1408 grants for community welfare projects were approved by the Social Security Department. A detailed list of AAP projects includes projects relating to citizens‚Äô advice bureaus, community centres, and resource centres, projects to aid families, women, children, young people, the aged, the handicapped, migrants and the needy. It would be difficult to refute the conclusion that the sum of $6.6 million granted to Regional Councils of Social Development in 1975-76 promoted a very large amount of constructive welfare activity because it was spent in support of local and often voluntary efforts.‚Äù Broadcast and television license fees were abolished, while a wide range of new benefits were introduced, such as a handicapped child's allowance, a special orphan's pension, and the Supporting Mothers Benefit. Rates of sickness and unemployment benefits were increased to bring them in line with other social security benefits, while funding was provided for child care, women's refuges, and community health programs. The means test for pensioners over the age of seventy-five was abolished in 1973, and in 1975 the means test was abolished for all pensioners over the age of seventy. As a result of the welfare measures undertaken by the Whitlam Government, social expenditures as a percentage of GDP rose from 12.5% to 17.6% during its time in office.Developments in Australian Politics by Judith Brett, James A. Gillespie, and Murray Goot Needs-based funding for schools was implemented, spending on technical colleges (including the construction of residential accommodation for students) was significantly increased, and special initiatives for the handicapped, Aborigines, and isolated children were introduced. Farmers benefited from tariff cuts and additional markets established by the Whitlam Government's trade and diplomatic initiatives, together with higher spending on regional education and health, rural research, and other upgraded country facilities. A number of measures were also undertaken to enhance women's rights. International conventions on equal pay, discrimination, and the political rights of women were ratified. New health centres and many women's refuges were established throughout Australia, together with a pre-school and child care program which catered for 100,000 children.Ross McMullin, The Light on the Hill: The Australian Labor Party 1891-1991 In March 1973, the service pension was extended to war widows, and in September that year the means test on service pensions was abolished for recipients over the age of 74. In May 1975 the means test was abolished for the age group 70‚Äì74 years. Free artificial limbs were also made available through the repatriation artificial limb and appliance centre to all amputees, while free medical and hospital treatment was introduced for veterans of both the Great War and the Boer War and for ex-prisoners of war. The Mental Health and Related Community Services Act of 1973 made grants available to the states for the provision of community-oriented services for drug, alcohol, and mental problems.The Whitlam Government 1972-1975 by Gough Whitlam In 1973, the age limit of 21 years was removed for the payment of additional pension for full- time students and for the payment of guardian's allowance or mother's allowance, and provision was made for payment of additional benefit for a child to continue after their 16th birthday and without limitation on age if the child was a dependent full-time student.http://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/05_2012/op12.pdf The government introduced reforms for the superannuation arrangements of its own employees. In July 1973, for instance, the government financed element of pensions was properly indexed against changes in the cost of living for the first time. In August 1973, fair rent provisions for houses and flats were introduced, while a separate housing list for needy families was introduced. In 1974, a generous rental rebate scheme and improved concessions on government loans were introduced to benefit low income earners. Funds were provided to improve the education of handicapped children, while money was also made available for upgrading accommodation in homeless persons‚Äô centres, while finance was also made available to centres on a pro rata basis for the provision of meals and accommodation. An Office of Women's Affairs was established to help women achieve equality, while the Legal Aid Office was set up to provide legal representation for those who could not afford it.http://stage6.pbworks.com/f/Whitlam+Summary.pdf The Trade Practices Act, passed in 1974, was aimed at promoting competition in the economy and to improve consumer safeguards. Funding on the arts was doubled, and both FM radio and radio station 2JJ were introduced, the latter in Sydney as part of a plan for a national youth radio network. A number of amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act were also made. The Act was revised to require the democratic control of unions by their rank-and-file members, to require that a union's rules should provide for full participation of its members in its affairs, and prohibited the dismissal of an elected official ‚Äúunless he is found guilty of misappropriation of funds, gross misbehaviour or gross neglect of duty.‚Äù The Act was also revised to prevent returning officers from rejecting a defective nomination ‚Äúwithout giving the candidate seven days in which to correct the defect,‚Äù to debar union officials from rejecting a rival's nomination for office, and to prohibit a union official or employee ‚Äúbeing appointed as that union‚Äôs returning officer.‚Äù Tariffs for farming implements and equipment were reduced, and farm incomes more than trebled during Whitlam's time in office. In 1973, a payment of emergency adjustment assistance was initiated to benefit canning-fruit growers and growers of pears and apples, while the Dairy Adjustment Act of 1974 provided generous assistance for financially unsound dairy farms. A number of environmental measures were also implemented by the Whitlam Government. In 1974, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act was passed, which was the first piece of Commonwealth legislation to specifically address environmental issues, and set up procedures to review the environmental impact of development proposals which involved Commonwealth Government decisions. In 1973, the federal government awarded $100,000 in grants to environmental centres throughout Australia, the first action of its kind in Australia. In 1975, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act was passed, which allowed for the establishment of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. The Supporting Mother's Benefit was introduced in 1973 to alleviate financial deprivation among women whose de facto husbands were in jail, deserted de facto wives, unmarried mothers and other wives separated from their husbands who, for other reasons, were not eligible for the widows‚Äô pension. The Double Orphans‚Äô pension was introduced that same year, providing $10 a week to the guardian of an orphan who had lost both parents. The Handicapped Children's Allowance, introduced a year later, provided $10 a week to the guardians of severely physically or mentally handicapped children who had not been placed in an institution. A special discretionary benefit was introduced for lone fathers in August 1974, payable at the unemployment benefit rate. In February 1973, eligibility for the standard rate of pension, payable to widow pensioners with children and single age and invalid pensioners, was extended to Class B widow pensioners (those over the age of fifty with no dependent children). A change was also made ensuring that pensioners would not lose their extra benefits when a student turned twenty- one. The standard age pension rate was increased from 19.5% of average weekly earnings in September 1972 to 24.4% by December 1975. Social welfare administration was also made more efficient and equitable via the establishment of a Social Welfare Commission and benefit appeals tribunals. The sales tax on artificial contraceptives was removed, while grants were made for family planning organisations. Maternity leave provisions for the Public Service were introduced consistent with the requirements of ILO Convention No. 103 ‚Äì Maternity Provisions (Revised), 1952. The Aged or Disabled Persons‚Äô Homes Bill of 1974 increased the Federal subsidy for aged persons‚Äô homes from two dollars for every dollar provided by a non-profit or local government association to four dollars, while also extending the provisions of the Aged Persons‚Äô Homes Act of 1954 to handicapped adults.Contemporary Issues in Gerontology: Promoting Positive Ageing edited by Victor Minichiello, Irene Coulson The Handicapped Persons‚Äô Assistance Bill of 1974 extended the government's program of assistance to voluntary organisations responsible for the welfare of handicapped people. While spending on education increased from 4.83% of GDP in 1972-73 to 6.18% in 1974-75, the Federal government's share of funding went up from 22.6% in 1972-73 to 42.5% in 1975-76. The Defence Service Homes Act of 1973 extended eligibility for a loan to current servicemen who had not served overseas but who had served for more than three years, to those who had served overseas under the banner of recognised welfare organisations, and to certain unmarried females with qualifying service. In addition, the maximum loan available under the scheme was increased from $9000 to $12000. For veterans, an expanded system of repatriation benefits was introduced, together with improved resettlement allowances, wider eligibility for defence service housing loans, a $1000 free-tax bonus for re-engagements, an attractive new retirement and death benefit scheme, and a more generous system of remuneration. The Whitlam Government also sought to extend to Federal public servants the conditions that their State counterparts had long enjoyed. Among the benefits that the Whitlam government introduced for Federal public servants included a reduction in the qualifying time for long-service leave from 15 to 10 years, the removal of job discrimination provisions against women, ample redundancy provisions, a minimum of 12 weeks paid maternity leave with six weeks of paid leave following confinement, one week of paid paternity leave for any employee required to stay at home to care for his wife during or following her confinement, and entitlement to four weeks of annual leave with a 17.5% loading. The government also financed a wide range of new local government programs through the State, including tourism, urban transport, national estate, leisure facilities, sewerage backlog, flood mitigation, area improvement, growth centres, and senior citizens‚Äô centres. Outlays on Aboriginal affairs programs were significantly increased with expenditure rising in real terms by 254.6% for legal aid, employment by 350.9%, education by 97.1%, health by 234.6%, and housing by 103.7%. The Australian Citizenship Act of 1973 established Australian citizenship for the first time on the basis of ‚Äúone criteria, one national allegiance, one citizenship and one ceremony,\\" while the Roads Grants Act 1974 provided funds for the building of rural arterial roads, urban arterial roads, minor traffic engineering and road safety improvements, rural local roads, developmental roads, urban local roads and beef roads. In 1973, an improved scheme of allowances was introduced to assist parents of children who did not have reasonable access to school services as a result of their geographic location. The quality of health care in rural areas was also improved via the development of a regional hospitals program and promotion of community-based health services. The Trade Union Training Authority Act of 1975 set up a national college and state centres designed to educate trade union leaders in various aspects of industrial relations. The Commonwealth Secondary Scholarship Scheme was replaced by a system of secondary allowances which were made available on the basis of financial need. An isolated children's allowance was introduced to compensate the educational disadvantages faced by children living in remote parts of the country. Greater spending was allocated to the arts, while spending on urban and regional development was accelerated, which contributed to a significant rise in the number of Australian households connected to a sewerage services. A School Dental Service Scheme was also introduced, providing free dental care for schoolchildren. Via grants to the states, the Whitlam Government funded the construction of 18,500 homes for low income earners from 1973 to 1975. Various measures were also introduced to enhance educational opportunities. A disadvantaged school program was introduced that provided additional financial assistance for more than 1,000 schools whose students suffered special socio- economic disadvantages. In 1973, capital funds and assistance with running costs were made available for the education of handicapped children while a large training program was initiated for teachers and basic training and research financed for the area of special education. A program of innovative educational projects was successful in providing parents, teachers, and community groups with the first opportunity to try out their ideas for improving education. Over 1,000 projects were funded, ranging from bee-keeping and remedial reading to computers, while a network of educational innovators was set up to exchange experiences and to provide mutual support among people who wanted to be active in improving schools. In 1975, the quality of school curricula was enhanced by the establishment of the Curriculum Development Centre. For those in higher education, the Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme was abolished and replaced by the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, which offered means-tested and non-competitive financial assistance for all tertiary students. Initiatives were introduced to assist teacher training. Following the delivery of a report by the Special Committee on Teacher Education in March 1973, the Whitlam Government introduced various measures to implement its recommendations for special grants to the States for the building of teachers‚Äô college libraries, fostering research into teacher education, increasing the number of students training to become teachers of handicapped children, and improving facilities in existing colleges of advanced education. The States Grants (Advanced Education) Act (No. 3) 1973 allocated $188 million for the development of teacher education in pre-school teachers‚Äô colleges, State teachers‚Äô colleges, and colleges of advanced education throughout 1973-75, while the States Grants (Advanced Education) Act of 1974 provided recurrent financial assistance for non-government teachers‚Äô colleges for 1974 and 1975. The first national program for technical and further education resulted from the recommendations of the Committee on Technical and Further Education, established in early 1973. This committee produced an interim report in April 1974 which led to the payment of capital and recurrent grants to the States for building and planning new technical colleges and improving facilities at existing ones, especially with respect to teacher training, library services, research facilities, and student accommodation. The sum total of Federal grants increased from $18.1 million in 1972-73 to $81.1 million in 1975-76. Expenditure on state government schools increased more than sixfold, and more than doubled on non-government schools. Resources were also allocated towards a program for migrants. In August 1973, an Immigration (Education) Act was introduced to provide (as an emergency measure under the child migrant education program) supplementary class-room accommodation in schools with special programs for migrant children. In 1973-74, the number of teachers for special migrant classes increased from 1,000 to 1,500 and the number of children receiving instruction went up from 40,000 to 60,000. Migrant education centres were established in Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, while a home tutoring scheme was established, designed to instruct migrant women in the English language. In migrant communities in all the states, 48 multilingual welfare officers were employed to overcome the social isolation of underprivileged groups. Portable benefit rights were also introduced, with respect to age, invalid, wives‚Äô and widows‚Äô pensions. Whereas under previous arrangements a pensioner had to live in Australia for 20 years after reaching the age of 16 and only had portability rights in Malta, Turkey, Greece, and Italy, the new provisions allowed a person drawing a pension to take up that benefit anywhere in the world after 10 years of Australian residence in the case of an age pension and after 5 years for most invalid pensions, while no period of residence was required for widows permanently resident in Australia when their husbands died. The voting age was also lowered to eighteen, and grant programs for regional development were introduced, which provided for urban renewal, the construction of sewerage systems in unserviced urban areas, tourist and leisure facilities, and flood prevention. During its last year in office, the Whitlam Government carried out measures such as the introduction of a national employment and training scheme, the first no fault divorce procedure in the world via the Family Law Act 1975, and a welfare payment for homeless Australians. In the field of communications, the Whitlam Government removed the limitations on the amount of non-English-language programming on radio and television and established the experimental ethnic radio stations 2EA in Sydney and 3EA in Melbourne. In addition, emergency telephone interpreter services were initiated in all community languages. A number of initiatives were also carried out to improve socio-economic conditions for Aborigines. The rate of training Aboriginal teachers and teachers‚Äô aides was increased, while the Aboriginal Secondary Grants Scheme was introduced to provide allowances to all students of Aboriginal descent attending secondary schools. An Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme was introduced to assist Aboriginal students in tertiary education institutions, while a scheme was introduced for Aboriginal children living in Aboriginal communities to receive primary school instruction in their own language and in their traditional arts and crafts. To grant Aborigines fairer representation within the legal system, the Whitlam Government significantly expanded the terms of the Aboriginal Legal Service established in 1970. $7.8 million was allocated between 1973 and 1976 to establish 25 offices throughout the country which provided free legal aid to Aborigines irrespective of the seriousness of the case. The offices had a majority of Aborigines on their governing bodies and, as a result, were integrated into local Aboriginal communities and provided trustworthy and effective legal representation. In addition, a change was made whereby Aborigines no longer needed to acquire permission to leave the country. Outlays on Aboriginal affairs programs were considerably increased, with expenditure increasing from $61.44 million in 1972-73 to $185.79 million in 1975-76, representing a real increase of 105.8%. Expenditure in real terms went up by 254.6% for legal aid, 350.9% for employment, 97.1% for education, 234.6% for health, and 103.7% for housing. Federal grants to the States for the purpose of Aboriginal health care increased from $4.4 million in 1972-73 to $21.5 million in 1975-76. An Aboriginal Health Service was set up, whereby health and social workers were trained to provide community-based services either at local clinics or as mobile teams in the field. According to Whitlam, this initiative was successful ‚Äúin eliminating the barriers that exist between Aborigines and primary health institutions.‚Äù The Housing Society Scheme allowed Aboriginal communities to formulate their own budgets in spending departmental grants (taking into account the importance of Aborigines determining their own housing needs), and by June 1975 over 100 housing societies had been set up and 450 houses had been completed under the scheme. The Aboriginal Loans Commission was set up in December 1974 to make personal and housing loans to Aborigines at a discounted rate of interest, and encouraged the incidence of Aboriginal home ownership while helping to overcome discrimination in finance markets whereby Aborigines with steady employment and incomes were often refused loans for reasons related to their race. In June 1973, the Whitlam Government set up Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. as a public enterprise designed to provide the Aboriginal population with essential and urgent accommodation. By 1975, 74 hostels had been set up, with a combined capacity of 1,677 beds. The budget presented on 17 September 1974 included a 173% increase for urban and regional development, a 30% increase for health, and a 78% increase for education. In addition, a revised income-tax scale reduced tax payable for people on incomes less than $10,500 a year. The 1975 budget provided funding for the new Medibank health scheme, together with a 2% increase in education, a 5% increase in urban and regional development, a 15% real increase in social security expenditure, and a restructuring of personal income tax. Despite being in office for only three years, the Whitlam Government was able to carry out a radical programme of progressive social reform, and arguably came far in meeting the promises of change envisioned by its electoral slogan. According to one historian, ‚ÄúIf many Labor supporters regard the Curtin and Chifley governments as a period of great achievements and greater ambitions frustrated by conservative forces, their illusions in the Whitlam government are even more heroic. After nearly a quarter of a century of stagnant conservative rule during which Australia seemed to be a backward looking outpost of the British empire run by monarchists and reactionaries, Gough Whitlam, the Mighty Gough, broke through and during his first 12 months in office remade Australia forever.‚Äù Legacy The words It's Time have become an important contribution to the lexicon of Labor's constituency since their first use in Blacktown in 1972. An updated version of the It's Time song was used in advertisements for the 'Yes' vote in the republic referendum in 1999, which ended with Whitlam saying: \\"Yes. It's time.\\" In 2000, after another period of Liberal dominance, the phrase had an unsuccessful short-lived recurrence, with Whitlam speaking on behalf of the Leader of the Labor Party, Kim Beazley. Labor's 2015 Marriage Equality initiative used the phrase \\"It's Time. Marriage Equality\\". The Anti Poverty Network of South Australia in 2018 with the Choir of Hard Knocks of Port Adelaide recorded a revised version of the It's Time song, it included lyrics such as: \\"It‚Äôs time for changing, not deck-chair rearranging.\\" \\"Time for poor folk, not rich folk.\\" \\"It‚Äôs time for us folk, yes it‚Äôs time.\\" and \\"It‚Äôs time for Newstart, to give a real start, One hundred more a week start, yes it‚Äôs time.‚Äù\\" The song is a campaign to the Australian Labor Party to commit if elected at the next federal election to raising Newstart, the Australian Governments Welfare and Social Safety Net for those who are unemployed.

Campbell was the first principal of the West Virginia Colored Institute (present-day West Virginia State University) from 1892 until 1894, and is considered by the university as its first president. Campbell was born in 1867 in Pomeroy, Ohio, where he completed his secondary education at Pomeroy Academy in 1884. His first job was as a teacher in Buck Ridge, Ohio, for two years. He relocated to West Virginia, where he served as the editor of The Pioneer and West Virginia Enterprise newspapers. He was the principal of the Point Pleasant Colored School (later known as Langston Academy) from 1891 until 1892. In 1892, he was selected as the first principal of the West Virginia Colored Institute, serving until 1894. He was awarded an honorary Bachelor of Philosophy degree from Shaw University in 1893. From an early age, Campbell exhibited a talent for writing poetry and stories. He wrote poetry and stories throughout his life. His first book, Driftings and Gleanings, a volume of poetry and essays in standard American English, was published in 1887. Following his resignation from the West Virginia Colored Institute, Campbell relocated to Chicago in 1895, where he became a staff writer for the Chicago Times-Herald. He continued to publish his own poems and articles, and he participated in the publication of Four O'Clock Magazine. In 1895, he published his second book, Echoes from the Cabin and Elsewhere, a collection of poetry in the southern African-American vernacular dialect. He was among the first African-American poets to write in the African-American vernacular dialect. Campbell died in Pomeroy, Ohio, in 1896 at the age of 28. At West Virginia State University, Campbell is the namesake of Campbell Hall and the Campbell Conference Center.  Early life and education  19th-century illustration of Pomeroy, Ohio, from the Ohio River James Edwin Campbell was born on September 28, 1867 in the Kerr's Run section of Pomeroy, Ohio, to James Edward Campbell and his wife, Aletha \\"Letha\\" Esther Starks Campbell. His parents were both born across the Ohio River in Virginia (present-day West Virginia) prior to the American Civil War. Campbell had two older brothers, Charles William Campbell and John C. Campbell. Campbell was raised in Kerr's Run, part of Pomeroy's First Ward. His childhood playmate, future West Virginia state auditor J. S. Darst, cited Campbell as a person who rose to prominence in spite of his early unfavorable environment, and described the \\"Bloody First\\" ward of Pomeroy as \\"tough\\". Campbell completed his primary education from first to eighth grade at Kerr's Run Colored School, and his secondary education at Pomeroy Academy, where he graduated in 1884.  Early work in education and newspaper publishing  Campbell commenced his career in education in Buck Ridge, Ohio (along the Ohio River), where he served as a teacher for two years. He also taught in Rutland, Ohio, for some time. Campbell viewed West Virginia as a place for the advancement of African Americans due to the economic opportunities offered by the coal and oil industries. He was hired by Christopher Payne to serve as the editor of Payne's The Pioneer newspaper. In 1887, Payne also hired Campbell to replace him as the editor of the West Virginia Enterprise in Charleston. In reporting Campbell's selection as the Enterprise editor, The Wheeling Daily Intelligencer described Campbell as \\"an educated young Ohioan\\" that was \\"highly spoken of\\". In addition to his newspaper work, Campbell was also a gifted public speaker. In May 1889, he delivered a lecture entitled \\"Race Antagonism\\" at the Simpson Methodist Episcopal Church in Wheeling. The Wheeling Daily Intelligencer remarked that he possessed \\"a natural gift of oratory, and his address was brimfull of eloquence, besides being instructive and worthy of attention\\". His lecture earned enough profits for the church to purchase a new Sunday school library.  Principal of Langston Academy  Portrait of Campbell from the Biennial Report of the State Superintendent (1893) Campbell was selected by the Point Pleasant Board of Education as the principal of the Point Pleasant Colored School in Point Pleasant in 1891, succeeding Luta Freeman. Under Campbell's leadership, the school relocated to a four-room, two-story brick building, which had been vacated by a white school. Following this relocation, the school was renamed Langston Academy in honor of African-American educator John Mercer Langston. Campbell served as principal of Langston Academy until 1892, when he was succeeded by Ida Wilson.  Principal of the West Virginia Colored Institute  On April 1, 1892, the Board of Regents of the West Virginia Colored Institute selected Campbell as the institute's first principal. Located in Farm, West Virginia (an unincorporated community later known as Institute), near Charleston, the institute had been founded in 1891 under the Morrill Act of 1890 to provide West Virginia's African Americans with education in agricultural and mechanical studies. Prior to Campbell's selection as principal, an act of the West Virginia Legislature appropriated $10,000 for the purchase of a farm on which to construct a building for the institution. A committee empowered by the legislature purchased along the Kanawha River, near the community of Farm, which was once part of the estate of Samuel I. Cabell and his wife Mary Barnes Cabell (a former slave). The institute's first building was completed in April 1892 and received by the school's Board of Regents on April 20. Campbell formally opened the institute on April 26, 1892. The institute commenced an experimental term on May 3, 1892 with 20 students. The original curriculum consisted of the equivalent of a high school education, and included agriculture, horticulture, mechanical arts, domestic science, vocational training, and teacher preparation. Campbell asked Booker T. Washington to nominate a Tuskegee Institute graduate to fill the position of the institute's Superintendent of Mechanics. Washington requested that Tuskegee graduate James M. Canty write a letter to Campbell. Canty was hired by Campbell as the Superintendent of Mechanics, and he arrived in Institute on January 3, 1893. By June 1893, the faculty consisted of Campbell, serving as principal and professor of mathematics; Byrd Prillerman, serving as professor of English; Canty, serving as professor of mechanics; and Campbell's wife, Mary Lewis Champ-Campbell, serving as instructor in music, painting, and drawing. In 1893, Campbell was awarded an honorary Bachelor of Philosophy degree from Shaw University. Fleming Hall at West Virginia Colored Institute (1910), where Campbell resided throughout his tenure As the institute's principal, Campbell provided guidance to West Virginia's African-American coal miners in assisting their children in acquiring an education. Campbell resigned in 1894, and was succeeded by John H. Hill. Throughout his tenure at the institute, Campbell resided in Fleming Hall.  West Virginia Teachers' Association  Campbell and other West Virginia African-American educators established the West Virginia Teachers' Association in 1891 to encourage interest in their work and cooperation throughout the state's African-American teaching corps. The association aimed \\"to elevate the character and advance the interest of the profession of teaching, and to promote the cause of popular education in West Virginia\\". Campbell spoke at the association's second annual meeting in Parkersburg in 1892. At the association's third annual meeting in Parkersburg in 1893, Campbell was named president of the association. However, he was absent when the association's fourth annual meeting was held in Montgomery in 1894.  Writing career  Front cover of Driftings and Gleanings (1887) From an early age, Campbell exhibited a talent for writing poetry and stories. Early in his writing career, he wrote simple poems in the African-American vernacular dialect, some of which were published in newspapers and magazines. One of his earlier poems, \\"The Pariah's Love\\", was written in the style of Thomas Moore's Lalla-Rookh. Campbell continued to write poetry and stories at his leisure throughout his careers as a schoolteacher and school administrator. In 1887, he published his first book, Driftings and Gleanings, a volume of poetry and essays in standard American English. Following his resignation from the West Virginia Colored Institute, he relocated to Chicago in the summer of 1895, where he became a staff writer for the Chicago Times- Herald. Campbell reportedly confided in a friend, \\"Life is too uneventful in a little village. I want to get out into the great world.\\" According to historian Wilhelmena S. Robinson, Campbell's career as a newsman was \\"his chief contribution to the literary world\\". Campbell continued to publish his own poems and articles, and he participated in a group publication of the literary periodical Four O'Clock Magazine. In 1895, he published his second book, Echoes from the Cabin and Elsewhere, a collection of poetry in the southern African-American vernacular dialect. The introduction was written by Richard Linthicum, editor of the Chicago Sunday Times-Herald. Linthicum wrote that Campbell had \\"caught the true spirit\\" of African Americans in the Antebellum South in \\"characteristic verse\\". According to the Poetry Foundation, this book \\"is often praised as one of the finest collections of dialect poems of the 19th century, managing to mix realism and folk wisdom with authentic, rhythmic dialect\\".  Personal life  Campbell married Mary Lewis Champ (July 12, 1868 ‚Äì October 18, 1909) on August 4, 1891 in Harrison County, Ohio. Champ was the daughter of Joseph L. Champ, an educator and former principal of African-American schools in Jefferson County, Ohio, and Parkersburg, West Virginia, and his wife Eveline Thompson Champ. Mary Lewis Champ enrolled in Oberlin College in 1887, and graduated from the college's Literary Course in 1890. Champ was also a poet and educator, and she taught in Wheeling for one year prior to marrying Campbell.  Death  Portrait of Campbell from Echoes from the Cabin and Elsewhere (1895) Campbell wrote his last poem, \\"Homesick\\", on December 7, 1895. Published in The Chicago Conservator, it detailed his longing for the \\"quiet of the home place\\". While visiting his family's home in the Kerr's Run section of Pomeroy, Ohio, for the Christmas holiday, Campbell became ill with symptoms of a common cold, followed by a fever. He died of typhoid pneumonia on January 26, 1896 at his family's home. He was survived by his parents and his wife. Campbell was interred at Beech Grove Cemetery in Pomeroy. Following his death, his wife taught in Pomeroy and then at Kentucky State Normal School for Colored Persons (later known as Kentucky State University) from 1902 until 1903. She relocated to St. Louis, where she died of tonsillitis in 1909.  Legacy  Campbell was among the first African-American poets to write in the African-American vernacular dialect. While Paul Laurence Dunbar is credited with popularizing verse in the African-American vernacular dialect, Campbell published his dialect poetry prior to Dunbar. African-American author and educator J. Saunders Redding stated, \\"Campbell's dialect is more nearly a reproduction of plantation Negro speech sounds than that of any other writer in American literature... Campbell's ear alone dictated his language.\\" Civil rights activist and writer James Weldon Johnson described Campbell's dialect as \\"idiomatically and phonetically ... nearer to the Gullah or the West Indian dialect\\". Historian Jean Wagner argued that Campbell \\"had his own highly original talent and was in no sense a borrower\\". Wagner further stated that Campbell \\"reveals the upsurge, among blacks, of a racial consciousness that chafes under every yoke\\". Actor Richard Berry Harrison used Campbell's poems when he delivered dramatic readings. The Meigs County Historical Society and the Ohio Historical Society erected a historical marker honoring Campbell in Pomeroy in 2007. In 1973, West Virginia State College honored Campbell by naming its vocational building Campbell Hall.

Vicine is toxic in individuals who have a hereditary loss of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. It causes haemolytic anaemia, called favism. The formation of vicine in Vicia faba has been studied, but this natural formation has not yet been found.  History  Vicine was initially isolated in 1870 from the seeds of Vicia sativa by a method of extraction with sulfuric acid and subsequent precipitation with mercury sulfate (HgSO4). Later vicine was also found in other Vicia species, namely Vicia faba, beet juice and peas. The chemical structure of the compound was built gradually. First the glycosidic nature of the compound was recognized in 1896. The same year the aglycone of vicine, divicine, was isolated. In the beginning of the 20th century the pyrimidine structure was recognized. Despite these initial successes, the correct formula of vicine was determined only in 1953 and it is 2,4-diamino-6-oxypyrimidine-5-(√ü-d-glucopyranoside).  Metabolism  Vicine is an inactive compound in the body. When vicine enters the body through food, it is hydrolysed by the intestinal microflora to a highly reactive free radical generating compound, the aglycone divicine. Upon hydrolysis, the glucose part of the molecule is split off and that results in the reduced divicine. Divicine is then taken up in the blood through the intestinal epithelium.  Adverse effects  Adverse effects almost solely occur in humans that suffer from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This deficiency causes a shortage of glutathione in erythrocytes and glutathione is needed for the neutralization of ROS (reactive oxygen species) created by the strongly reducing agent divicine. = Indications = Persons with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic. An attack of acute haemolytic anaemia can appear out of nowhere and can be very severe and life-threatening. Indications of such a sudden attack of favism are dark urine, pallor, jaundice, abdominal pain and in most cases fever.  Toxicity  The Œ≤-glycosidic bond between glucose and the hydroxyl group at C5 on the pyrimidine ring are hydrolysed to yield the aglycone of vicine, divicine (2,6-diamino-4,5-dihydroxypyrimidine). These aglycones have a strong oxidising capacity for glutathione. In healthy individuals, this is not a problem, as glutathione can be reduced quickly enough to regenerate it. In individuals with a deficiency for glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) however, this results in haemolytic anaemia.  Effects on animals  A 10 g vicine /kg diet in laying hens led to reduced feed intake, egg weight, haemoglobin levels and fertility and increased liver weights, liver glutathione levels and plasma lipid levels. A diet with comparable levels of vicine per kg in pigs showed only small effects on protein and energy digestibility. In another study, laying and broiler hens were fed grains that were soaked for different periods of time, which partly or totally removed vicine. Hens that had had grains with vicine still in them showed a significant decrease in corpuscular haemoglobin, while the others did not. An in vivo study in rats showed that oral administration of vicine resulted in only small reductions in glutathione concentrations and no mortality. Intraperitoneal administration however, led to a rapid decrease in glutathione followed by death because of anoxia.

There are three veins, rather than the single vein in the stamen of most flowering plants. The gynoecium develops in an unusual way, similar to Winteraceae, with laminal placentation, i.e., the young carpel is cup-shaped, and the ovules develop on its upper surface. The margins of the carpel never fully fuse. A cleft remains filled with hairs, through which the pollen tubes grow towards the ovules. ReferencesExternal links * Degeneriaceae in L. Watson and M.J.

Formulated at the initiative of Clement Attlee, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the mission had Lord Pethick-Lawrence, the Secretary of State for India, Sir Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade, and A. V. Alexander, the First Lord of the Admiralty. Lord Wavell, the Viceroy of India, did not participate in every step but was present and it was divided into three groups: A, B and C clusters. Background Towards the end of their rule, the British found that their temporary patronage of the Muslim League conflicted with their longstanding need for Indian unity. The desire for a united India was an outcome of both their pride in having politically unified the subcontinent and the doubts of most British authorities as to the feasibility of Pakistan. This desire for Indian unity was symbolized by the Cabinet Mission, which arrived in New Delhi on 24 March 1946, sent by the British government, in which the subject was the form of a post-independent India. The three men who constituted the mission, Stafford Cripps, Pethick-Lawrence and A.V. Alexander favoured India's unity for strategic reasons. Upon arriving in the subcontinent the mission found both parties, the Indian National Congress and Muslim League, more unwilling than ever to reach a settlement. The two parties had performed well in the elections and emerged as the two main parties in the subcontinent, the provincial organisations having been defeated. That was because of the separate electorates system. The Muslim League had been victorious in approximately 90 percent of the seats for Muslims. After having achieved victory in the elections Jinnah gained a strong hand to bargain with the British and Congress. Having established the system of separate electorates, the British could no longer reverse its consequences in spite of their genuine commitment to Indian unity. Plan The mission made its own proposals, after inconclusive dialogue with the Indian leadership, seeing that the Congress opposed Jinnah's demand for a Pakistan comprising six full provinces. The mission proposed a complicated system for India with three tiers: the provinces, provincial groupings and the centre. The centre's power was to be confined to foreign affairs, defence, currency and communications. The provinces would keep all the other powers and were allowed to establish three groups. The plan's main characteristic was the grouping of provinces. Two groups would be constituted by the mainly-Muslim western and eastern provinces. The third group would comprise the mostly-Hindu areas in the south and the centre. Thus provinces such as UP, CP, Bombay, Bihar, Orissa and Madras would make Group A. Group B would comprise Sind, Punjab, Northwest Frontier and Baluchistan. Bengal and Assam would make a Group C. Reactions Through the scheme, the British expected to maintain Indian unity, as both they and Congress wanted, and also providing Jinnah the substance of Pakistan. The proposals almost satisfied Jinnah's insistence on a large Pakistan, which would avert the moth-eaten Pakistan without the mostly non-Muslim districts in Bengal and Punjab being partitioned away. By holding the full provinces of Punjab and Bengal, Jinnah could satisfy the provincial leaders who feared losing power if their provinces were divided. The presence of large Hindu minorities in Punjab and Bengal also provided a safeguard for the Muslim minorities remaining in the mostly-Hindu provinces. Most of all, Jinnah wanted parity between Pakistan and India. He believed that provincial groupings could best secure this. He claimed that Muslim India was a 'nation' equally entitled to central representations as Hindu India. Despite his preference for only two groups, the Muslim League's Council accepted the mission's proposals on 6 June 1946 after securing a guarantee from Wavell that the League would be placed in the interim government if the Congress did not accept the proposal. The onus was now on Congress. It accepted the proposals, understanding it to be a repudiation of the demand for Pakistan, and its position was that the provinces should be allowed to stay out of groups that they did not want to join, in light of both NWFP and Assam being ruled by Congress governments. However, Jinnah differed and saw the grouping plan as mandatory. Another point of difference concerned the Congress position that a sovereign constituent assembly would not be bound to the plan. Jinnah insisted it be binding once the plan was accepted. The groupings plan maintained India's unity, but the organisation's leadership and, most of all Nehru, increasingly believed that the scheme would leave the centre without the strength to achieve the party's ambitions. Congress' socialist section led by Nehru desired a government able to industrialize the country and to eliminate poverty. Nehru's speech on 10 July 1946 rejected the idea that the provinces would be obliged to join a group and stated that the Congress was neither bound nor committed to the plan. In effect, Nehru's speech squashed the mission's plan and the chance to keep India united. Jinnah interpreted the speech as another instance of treachery by the Congress. With Nehru's speech on groupings, the Muslim League rescinded its previous approval of the plan on 29 July. Interim government and breakdown Concerned by the diminishing British power, Wavell was eager to inaugurate an interim government. Disregarding Jinnah's vote, he authorised a cabinet in which Nehru was the interim prime minister. Sidelined and with his Pakistan of \\"groups\\" refused, Jinnah became distraught. To achieve Pakistan and impose on Congress that he could not be sidelined, he resorted to \\"direct action\\", which sparked rioting and massacres. Direct Action Day further increased Wavell's resolve to establish the interim government. On 2 September 1946, Nehru's cabinet was installed. Millions of Indian Muslim households flew black flags to protest the installation of the Congress government. Jinnah did not himself join the interim government but sent Liaquat Ali Khan into it to play a secondary role. Congress did not want to give him the important position of home minister and instead allowed him the post of finance minister. Liaquat Ali Khan infuriated Congress by using his role to prevent the functioning of Congress ministries, demonstrating (under Jinnah's instructions) the impossibility of a single government for India. Britain tried to revive the cabinet mission's scheme by sending Nehru, Jinnah and Wavell in December to meet Attlee, Cripps and Pethick-Lawrence. The inflexible arguments were enough to cause Nehru to return to India and announce that \\"we have now altogether stopped looking towards London.\\" Meanwhile, Wavell commenced the Constituent Assembly, which the League boycotted. He anticipated that the League would enter it as it had joined the interim government. Instead, the Congress became more forceful and asked him to drop ministers from the Muslim League. Wavell was also not able to obtain a declaration from the British government that would articulate their goals. In the context of the worsening situation, Wavell drew up a breakdown plan that provided for a gradual British exit, but his plan was considered fatalistic by the Cabinet. When he insisted on his plan, he was replaced with Lord Mountbatten. See also *Opposition to the partition of India ReferencesBibliography *Ian Talbot; Gurharpal Singh (23 July 2009).

Ecology  Protogynous and autocompatible flowers, with a reduction in selfing through herkogamy, diurnal synchronization of anthesis and the tendency of the same plant to not flower on two consecutive days. Anthesis lasts one or two days, at the height the flower behaves functionally as a female, showing its gynoecium and with open staminodes, while the stamens remain below the flower. The flower later behaves as a male with the intrastaminal staminodes folded inwards hiding the gynoecium and with erect stamens. The staminodes secrete an oily exudate and emit a fruity smell that attracts beetles, particularly of the genus Elleschodes (Curculionidae), that visit the flowers in both phases, in addition the synandria fall to the ground (cantharophily pollination). The fruit is sweet and aromatic and it is dispersed by birds and mammals (zoochory). The fruit is also eaten by humans.

They were admitted into Division 5 (East) of the Eastbourne & Hastings Football League for the 1971‚Äì72 season and by 1976 had progressed to Intermediate status in 1976 and had reached the Premier Division the following year. For the 1982‚Äì83 season STAMCO joined the Southern Counties Combination, winning Division Two in their first season. Within the next three seasons the club had won two Premier Division Championships and were promoted into Division Three of the Sussex County League in 1988. The gained senior status after earning promotion into Division Two by finishing Runners-up in the League and Cup. In the 1992‚Äì93 season they won promotion into Division One as Runners-up after missing out on the Championship on the final day of the season. View of the Main Stand at the Firs, after the ground became disused. Their first season in Division One saw them finish in 9th place and reach the semi-finals of the Sussex Senior Cup, the next two seasons they finished Runners-up to Peacehaven & Telscombe and they won promotion to the Southern League for the 1996‚Äì97 season. However, before they were accepted into the Southern League, the league required that the club, who were by now playing at The Firs, changed their name to reflect the club's geographical location. The club's two main sponsors, STAMCO and Croft Glass, were fused into the new name, the result was St. Leonards Stamcroft. The 1996‚Äì97 season saw the club finish runners up to Forest Green and won the Sussex Senior Cup, beating Saltdean United 2‚Äì1 in the final. However the club were relegated in their only season in the Premier Division and struggled both on the pitch and financially the following seasons. During the 2002‚Äì03 they resigned from the Southern League and returned to the Sussex County League for the 2003‚Äì04, however mounting debts had caught up with them and they folded during the season. Colours and crest The club used various crests during its history, the first crest used consisted of an oak tree and a football above the words 'Stamco Football Club', the crest was in the club's colours of light blue and white. In 1998 the club started using the town crest of St. Leonards-on-Sea, which had been created by James Burton in the 1820s.http://www.footballcrests.com/clubs/st-leonards-fc Ground The club moved to The Firs, from Pannel Lane, in 1993. The ground had previously been used by Hastings Town until they moved into the Pilot Field next door after the demise of the old Hastings United. During the summer of 1993, the ground was redeveloped ensuring the club could play in Division One of the Sussex County League. Further improvements were made to the ground in 1996, to allow the club to enter the Southern League, after initially being rejected. After the club folded the ground was briefly used by St. Leonards Social FC, who play in the East Sussex League, however the ground has since become disused and a 5-a-side astroturf pitch was constructed on the pitch, ensuring that no local club can again use the Firs.

The Turkish National Movement () encompasses the political and military activities of the Turkish revolutionaries that resulted in the creation and shaping of the modern Republic of Turkey, as a consequence of the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and the subsequent occupation of Constantinople and partitioning of the Ottoman Empire by the Allies under the terms of the Armistice of Mudros. The Ottomans saw the movement as part of an international conspiracy against them.British Views of the Turkish National Movement in Anatolia (1919-1922) by A. L. Macfie The Turkish revolutionaries rebelled against this partitioning and against the Treaty of S√®vres, signed in 1920 by the Ottoman government, which partitioned portions of Anatolia itself. This establishment of an alliance of Turkish revolutionaries during the partitioning resulted in the Turkish War of Independence, the abolition of the Ottoman sultanate on 1 November 1922 and the declaration of the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923. The movement declared that the only source of governance for the Turkish people would be the democratic Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The movement was created in 1919 through a series of agreements and conferences throughout Anatolia and Thrace. The process was aimed to unite independent movements around the country to build a common voice and is attributed to Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk,Atat√ºrk and the Turkish Nation Source US Library of Congress as he was the primary spokesperson, public figure, and military leader of the movement. Amasya Agreement, June 1919 The Amasya Agreement was important in many respects. It was the first call to the national movement against the occupying powers. It consisted of talks about national independence. The message read as follows: * The unity of the motherland and national independence are in danger. * The Istanbul government is unable to carry out its responsibilities. * It is only through the nation's effort and determination that national independence will be won. * It is necessary to establish a national committee, free from all external influences and control, that will review the national situation and make known to the world the peoples desires for justice. * It has been decided to hold immediately a National Congress in Sivas, the most secure place in Anatolia. * Three representatives from each province should be sent immediately to the Sivas Congress. * To be prepared for every eventuality, this subject should be kept a national secret. * There will be a congress for the Eastern Provinces on July 10. The delegation from the Erzurum Congress will depart to join to the general meeting in Sivas. This agreement was signed by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, Rauf Orbay, Ali Fuat Cebesoy, Refet Bele and later K√¢zƒ±m Karabekir in Erzurum. Conferences=Erzurum Congress, August 1919= Mustafa Kemal Pasha during the Erzurum Congress. On American Mandate: On 1 August 1919, the King-Crane Commission tried to contact a large groups of interested parties in Constantinople (Ottoman Control), to obtain their positions with a view toward reporting them to the Paris Peace Conference. Kazƒ±m Karabekir learned that a memorandum was adopted by an amalgamation of political groups in Constantinople and consequently, the Erzurum Congress, which has been in session since 23 July (until 7 August 1919) sent a memorandum to American President Woodrow Wilson on the same day (1 August). It was probably also meant to remind all other parties of Wilson's 14 Points and the fact that the Nationalists were aware of them. Among the objectives of the Nationalists was, it appears, to signal the resolve of the Nationalists to the interested parties, and display their intent not to tolerate indiscriminate political pressure. What began as a suggestion to the Nationalists to accept the American Mandate at the time of the Erzurum Congress, became a major campaign immediately afterwards. By the time Sivas Congress was convened, no less than three channels were working on the Nationalist leadership to persuade them at least to \\"consider\\" the American Mandate, if not outright adopt a resolution in favor of it at the Sivas Congress. =Sivas Congress, September 1919= Members of the movement during the Sivas Congress, left to right: Rauf Orbay, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, and Ahmet R√ºstem Bilinski. The Sivas Congress was the first time the fourteen leaders of the movement united under a single roof. These people formed a plan between 16 and 29 October. They agreed that the parliament should meet in Constantinople, even if it were obvious that this parliament could not function under the occupation. It was a great chance to build the base and legitimacy. They decided on formalizing a \\"Representative Committee\\" that would handle the distribution and implementation, which could easily be turned into a new government if allies decided to disband the whole Ottoman Governing structure. Mustafa Kemal established two concepts into this program: independence and integrity. Mustafa Kemal was setting the stage for conditions which would legitimize this organization and illegitimate the Ottoman parliament. These conditions were also mentioned in the Wilsonian rules. Mustafa Kemal opened the National Congress at Sivas, with delegates from the entire nation taking part. The Erzurum resolutions were transformed into a national appeal, and the name of the organization changed to the Society to Defend the Rights and Interests of the Provinces of Anatolia and Rumeli. The Erzurum resolutions were reaffirmed with minor additions, these included new clauses such as article 3 which states that the formation of an independent Greece on the Aydƒ±n, Manisa, and Balƒ±kesir fronts was unacceptable. The Sivas Congress essentially reinforced the stance taken at the Erzurum Congress. All these were performed while the Harbord Commission arrived in Constantinople.Finkel, Caroline, Osman's Dream, (Basic Books, 2005), 57; \\"Istanbul was only adopted as the city's official name in 1930..\\". Amasya Protocol, October 1919Grand National Assembly, April 1920 Plans were made to organize a new government and parliament in Ankara, and the sultan asked to accept its authority. A flood of supporters moved to Ankara just ahead of the Allied dragnets. Included among them were Halide Edip, her husband, Adnan Adƒ±var, ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, Kemal‚Äôs most important allies in the Ministry of War, and the last president of the Chamber of Deputies, Celalettin Arif. The latter's desertion of the capital was of great significance. A legally elected president of the last representative Ottoman Parliament, he claimed that it had been dissolved illegally, in violation of the Constitution, enabling Kemal to assume full governmental powers for the Ankara regime. On March 1920, he announced that the Turkish nation was establishing its own Parliament in Ankara under the name Grand National Assembly. Some 100 members of the Ottoman Parliament were able to escape the Allied roundup and joined 190 deputies elected around the country by the national resistance group. On April 23, 1920, the new Assembly gathered for the first time, making Mustafa Kemal its first president and ƒ∞smet Inon√º, now deputy from Edirne, chief of the General Staff. Conclusion After the establishment of the movement and the successful Turkish War of Independence, the revolutionaries abolished the Ottoman sultanate on November 1, 1922, and proclaimed the Republic of Turkey on October 29, 1923. The movement terminated the Treaty of S√®vres and negotiated the Treaty of Lausanne, assuring recognition of the national borders, termed Misak-ƒ± Mill√Æ (National Pact). The national forces were united around the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk and the authority of the Grand National Assembly set up in Ankara, which pursued the Turkish War of Independence. The movement gathered around a progressively defined political ideology that is generally termed \\"Kemalism\\", or \\"Atat√ºrk√ß√ºl√ºk\\". Its basic principles stress the Republic - a form of government representing the power of the electorate, secular administration (la√Øcit√©), nationalism, a mixed economy with state participation in many sectors (as opposed to state socialism), and national modernization. Turkish revolutionaries were mainly influenced by ideas which flourished during the Tanzimat period. The revolutionaries should not be associated with the Young Turk movement of the same era, which was tightly bound to the Ottoman State and the ideals of Ottomanism. Turkish revolutionaries indeed were not a homogeneous group of people, as they had different ideas on social and political issues. There were years in which most of them did not communicate with each other, even though they presided over the major social and political institutions. The common idea which held them together was having a sovereign nation.

Hess was born in Baoba, Pennsylvania. At the age of two, after his mother's death, the family moved to Margaretville, New York where he grew up. Hess was inspired by Doctor Gordon Bostwick Maurer‚Äîwho started Margaretville's first hospital in 1925‚Äî to study medicine. He married Dr. Maurer's sister, Carol Maurer, in 1928. Hess went to Lafayette College and was graduated in 1927, and received his MD from the University at Buffalo. He completed an internship at Children's Hospital in Buffalo, New York and became an obstetrician and gynecologist. For most of his career, Hess practiced at Yale-New Haven Hospital, interrupted by World War II service as a surgeon in the 48th Armored Medical Battalion attached to the 2nd Armored Division in the invasions of North Africa, Sicily and Normandy. He was clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Yale School of Medicine. He also served as president of the Connecticut State Medical Society, and director of health services for the Connecticut Welfare Department. Hess died in New Haven at the age of 96. Hess was predeceased by his wife Carol in 1998. He is survived by two daughters, Dr. Katherine Halloran of Lexington, and Carolyn Westerfield of Hamden; five grandchildren; and five great-granddaughters. Early use of penicillin On March 14, 1942, John Bumstead and Hess became the first doctors in the world to successfully treat a patient (Anne Miller) with penicillin. Hess received the American Medical Association's Scientific Achievement Award in 1979 for his work on this case. Fetal heart monitor development Hess began working on a fetal heart monitor in the 1930s as a research fellow at Yale University due to his frustration with the limitations of using a stethoscope on a subject with two heartbeats and undergoing contractions. In 1949, after World War II, Hess returned to Yale and resumed his work, along with postdoctoral fellow Dr. Edward Hon. In 1957, using a six- and-a-half-foot-tall machine, they became the first in the world to continuously monitor electrical cardiac signals from a fetus. Through the 1960s, working with Wasil Kitvenko, the chief of the medical school's electronics laboratory, Dr. Hess continued to improve on the equipment, introducing telemetry and reducing the monitor's size. The device, which allowed monitoring to continue during labor, became one of the most-used tests in obstetrics. The original machine still resides today in the basement of a building just outside the city of Hartford called the \\"Hartford Medical Society.\\" References  with  * Category:1906 births Category:2002 deaths Category:People from the Catskills Category:Physicians from New Haven, Connecticut Category:American obstetricians Category:American gynecologists Category:University at Buffalo alumni Category:Yale School of Medicine faculty Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:20th-century American inventors ","title":"Orvan Hess"},{"id":"3950156","text":"The Nuclear Command Authority (NCA) of India is the authority responsible for command, control and operational decisions regarding India's nuclear weapons programme.  Introduction  Narendra Modi is the current Prime Minister of India and heads the NCA India's first Nuclear test was conducted on 18 May 1974 with the code name Smiling Buddha. Since then India has conducted another series of tests at the Pokhran test range in the state of Rajasthan in 1998, which included a thermonuclear test, code named Operation Shakti. India has an extensive civil and military nuclear program, which includes at least 10 nuclear reactors, uranium mining and milling sites, heavy water production facilities, a uranium enrichment plant, fuel fabrication facilities, and extensive nuclear research capabilities. Though India has not made any official statements about the size of its nuclear arsenal, different country estimates indicate that India has anywhere between 150 and 300 nuclear weapons.Norris, Robert S. and Hans M. Kristensen. \\"India's nuclear forces, 2005 ,\\" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 61:5 (September/October 2005): 73‚Äì75.India's Nuclear Weapons Program - Present Capabilities On 4 January 2003, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) constituted the Political Council and the Executive Council of the NCA. The Executive Council gives its opinion to the Political Council, which authorises a nuclear attack when deemed necessary. While the Executive Council is chaired by the National Security Advisor (NSA), the Political Council is chaired by the Prime Minister. This mechanism was implemented to ensure that Indian nukes remain firmly in civilian control and that there exists a sophisticated Command and Control (C2) mechanism to prevent their accidental or unauthorised use. Strategic Forces Command The directives of the NCA are to be operationalised by the Strategic Forces Command under the control of a Commander-in-Chief of the rank of Air Marshal (or its equivalent) in charge of the management and administration of the tactical and strategic nuclear forces. The NCA may be seen as the first stage in the development of an effective and robust Command and Control (C2) and Indications-and-Warning (I&W;) systems and infrastructure for its strategic nuclear forces.  Delivery of weapons  The current status of delivery systems for Indian nuclear weapons is unclear and highly classified. India has developed and tested nuclear weapons that could be delivered on the Prithvi and Agni missiles, although its extent and operational preparedness in this respect remains unclear. India first tested the 150 km range Prithvi-1 in 1988, and the 250 km range Prithvi-2 in 1996, and the Prithvi missiles were inducted into the Indian armed forces by the early to mid 1990s. India was slow to develop the Agni missiles. It first tested the Agni technology demonstrator in 1989, the two-stage 2000 km range Agni-2 in 1999, and the one-stage 700 km range Agni-1 in 2001. It first tested the 3,000 km range three-stage Agni-3 in 2006. Since India had a few nuclear weapons prior to the availability of these missiles, especially the Agni, it is probable that the current Indian nuclear weapons inventory includes weapons designed for delivery using aeroplanes. One or more of the following aircraft types might be used for this purpose. There are no open-source reports suggesting which if any of these planes have been equipped to deliver air-dropped atomic weapons. The MiG-27 and the Jaguar were originally designed to perform ground attack missions, and would require only modest modification to deliver nuclear weapons. The Indian Air Force also operates several other older and less capable types of ground-attack aircraft which would seem rather less likely candidates for delivering nuclear weapons. The MiG-29, Sukhoi Su-30 MKI and Mirage 2000 were originally designed to perform air-to-air combat missions, though they could potentially be modified to deliver air-dropped nuclear weapons. Plans are also on for the delivery of nuclear weapons via the Arihant class submarine using the SLBM/SLCM Sagarika.

As the city's German name N√ºrnberg would lead to confusion with the N√ºrburgring, the old name Noris was chosen for the simple track which is now approximately long. History Since 18 May 1947, motor racing events around the remaining long grand stand (Zeppelinhaupttrib√ºne or simply Steintrib√ºne) are held on streets that are otherwise used for public traffic. Different configurations were used in the early years, including figure-8 layouts. Nowadays, the start-finish straight in front of the central grand stand leads to a right hand sweeper and the lefthand U-turn at Grundig tower, and back in a (now lefthand) sweeper to the Steintrib√ºne, where the \\"Sch√∂ller-S\\" right-left chicane lead to the backstraight at its backside. Cars touch the outside wall often there. After a righthand kink, the lefthand U-turn of \\"Dutzendteichkehre\\" leads back to the main straight after a flat-out lefthand kink. Due to its proximity of the lake \\"Dutzendteich\\" and its location inside a large city, the track and event is compared to the Monaco Grand Prix (Fr√§nkisches Monaco). The annual mid-July Norisringrennen is considered a highlight of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters series, as fans get closer to the action and the drivers than on modern venues. Fatalities Mexican racing driver Pedro Rodr√≠guez died at Norisring in 1971 when the Ferrari 512 he was hired to drive (in championship events, he used to race a Gulf Racing-Porsche 917) hit the bridge wall before Sch√∂ller-S and burst in flames. Afterwards, the track was shortened by moving the Grundigkehre U-turn closer in order to reduce corner speeds. In 2006, a memorial plaque was inaugurated at the site of the crash.

Professional life Campbell has taught at the State University of New York at Brockport; the British College in Palermo, Sicily; Macalester College; California State University, Los Angeles; the State University of New York at Binghamton, the University of Kansas, Lawrence, where she was director of the women‚Äôs studies program; and at the University of Minnesota, where she chaired the Department of Communication Studies for nine years. She also edited the Quarterly Journal of Speech for three years. She was a fellow at the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in 1992. Theoretical Contributions Karlyn Kohrs Campbell is currently a professor at the University of Minnesota where she teaches courses such as Seminar in Rhetorical Criticism, Intro to Rhetorical Criticism, and Rhetoric of Feminism. Her specialties include women in communication, rhetorical theory and criticism, presidential rhetoric, and political campaigns.\\"Karlyn K Campbell.\\" : Communication Studies : University of Minnesota. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Feb. 2014. . One of her most famous works in which she incorporates her rhetorical ideas is Agency: Promiscuous and Protean. In this essay, she attempts to proclaim the meanings of agency by referencing Sojourner Truth at the 1851 woman's rights convention. This is just one of the many examples in which she incorporates her interest in feminism and feminist rhetoric into her own works.\\"Changing Rhetoric: Karlyn Kohrs Campell and Kathleen Hall Jamieson.\\" Jepson Forum. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Feb. 2014 . Another significant work Campbell contributed to is Deeds Done in Words: Presidential Rhetoric and the Genre of Governance, which was co-written with Kathleen Hall Jamieson and published in 1990. In 2008, a contemporary, updated edition called Presidents Creating the Presidency: Deeds Done in Words was published. In these two works, Campbell and Jamieson create a monumental framework for analyzing the rhetoric surrounding presidential oratory. They argue that the presidency is defined by what the president says and how they say it. Through the framework that Campbell and Jamieson create, they describe the different situations and actions in which presidents operate, such as inaugural addresses, special inaugural addresses in the ascension of a vice president, national eulogies, pardoning rhetoric, state of the union addresses, veto messages, the signing statement as the de facto item veto, presidential war rhetoric, presidential rhetoric of self-defense, and the rhetoric of impeachment. This work covers all the presidents up to George W. Bush. Campbell and Jamieson argue that presidential discourse has had multiple demands of audience, occasion, and institution and in the process of either satisfying or failing, political capital and presidential authority is either supplemented from or depleted to the other branches of government. The original work of Deeds Done in Words: Presidential Rhetoric and Genre of Governance was updated to address new developments such as the ever-evolving rhetorical strategies and technological advancements in media.  Awards  Kohrs Campbell is the recipient of numerous awards for her distinguished work including the Francine Merritt Award for contributions to women, and the University of Minnesota Distinguished Woman Scholar Award. She also has received the NCA‚Äôs Donald H. Ecroyd Award for Outstanding Teaching in Higher Education, the National Communication Association Distinguished Scholar Award, the Ehninger Award for Distinguished Rhetorical Scholarship, the Winans-Wichelns Book Award, and the Charles Woolbert Award for Scholarship of Exceptional Quality.http://www.comm.umn.edu/faculty/profile.php?UID=campb003 Due to her success, the Karlyn Kohrs Campbell Award is presented to the author(s) of the Top Paper submitted to the Rhetorical Theory and Criticism Interest Group at the Central States Communication Association Convention.Campbell, Karlyn K.

In the summer of 1792, two expeditions led by Captains George Vancouver, Dionisio Alcal√° Galiano and Cayetano Vald√©s y Flores arrived and cooperated in mapping the sound. Vancouver named it Desolation Sound, cryptically claiming that \\"there was not a single prospect that was pleasing to the eye\\". Geography The sound is flanked by Cortes Island, East Redonda Island and West Redonda Island. Adjacent waterways include Lewis Channel (to the northwest), Waddington Channel (to the northeast), Homfray Channel (to the east), Okeover Inlet (to the southeast), and the Strait of Georgia (to the south). Major provincial parks located within the sound include Desolation Sound Marine Provincial Park, Malaspina Provincial Park, Okeover Arm Provincial Park, and Roscoe Bay Provincial Park.

It is the emotional story of a precocious young boy growing up in a mendacious and dishonorable family. He befriends his tutor, who is the only adult in his life that he can trust. James presents their relationship with sympathy and insight, and the story reaches what some would consider the status of classical tragedy. Plot summary Pemberton, a penniless graduate of Oxford, takes a job to tutor Morgan Moreen, aged eleven, a brilliant and somewhat cynical member of a wandering American family. His mother and father refuse to pay Pemberton as they jump their bills from one hotel to another in Europe. Pemberton grows to dislike all the Moreens except Morgan, including older brother Ulick and sisters Paula and Amy. Morgan, who is afflicted with heart trouble, advises Pemberton to escape his family's baleful influence. But Pemberton stays on because he has come to love and admire his pupil and he hopes for at least some eventual payment. Pemberton finally has to take another tutoring job in London simply to make ends meet. He is summoned back to Paris, though, by a telegram from the Moreens that says Morgan has fallen ill. It turns out that Morgan is healthy enough, though the fatal day arrives when his family is evicted from their hotel for nonpayment. Morgan's parents beg Pemberton to take their son away with him while they try to find some money. Morgan is ecstatic at the prospect of leaving with Pemberton, but the tutor hesitates. Morgan suddenly collapses with a heart attack and dies. In the story's ironic final note, James says that Morgan's father takes his son's death with the perfect manner of \\"a man of the world.\\" Major themes To use the phrase of James's secretary Theodora Bosanquet, Morgan is one of the novelist's \\"children of light,\\" people with insight and delicacy who are often ground down by harsh, unforgiving environments. In Morgan's case that environment is tragically provided by his own family. That's why the boy clings so ardently to Pemberton, a tutor who truly appreciates Morgan's ability and decency and offers a possible escape from the deceitful, mediocre Moreen troupe. When the moment of opportunity comes, though, Pemberton hesitates. His reservations are understandable; he has no financial resources to take on the responsibility of raising a teen-aged boy. But that bit of hesitancy proves fatal. Once again, one of James's honorable and intelligent characters succumbs to inescapable reality. There has been much talk about the exact nature of the relationship between Pemberton and Morgan, with some commentators intimating a homosexual/paedophile attachment. See also the discussion of the story at Joseph S. O'Leary's homepage. Although there is no overt hint of a sexual relationship in the story, tutor and pupil do establish a bond of love and respect, which shines in contrast to the mundane, unimaginative world of the other Moreens: \\"Pemberton held him fast, hands on his shoulders ‚Äî he had never loved him so.\\" But the relationship between the two can be interpreted through the lens of sadomasochism. The sadomasochistic undertones can be best seen in the scene in which the pair speak of \\"beating\\" each other. Furthermore, Morgan's death can be interpreted as la petite mort as the child become euphoric at the prospect of leaving with his tutor. Critical evaluation Critic Robert Gale flatly called The Pupil \\"one of the finest short stories ever written,\\" and few commentators have disagreed. Mortimer Adler included the story in his Gateway to the Great Books series. Besides the dispute about possible homosexual overtones in the relationship between Morgan and Pemberton, critics have also disagreed about how much responsibility the tutor bears for the boy's sudden collapse and death. There's no doubt that Morgan is disappointed when he sees Pemberton hesitate about taking him away from his worthless family. As mentioned before, that hesitation is understandable but Pemberton still falls short of heroic action in an admittedly difficult situation. And as Lionel Trilling observed about the story, sometimes a man is a hero or he is nothing at all.

Background Mary Coughlan was born in Galway, Ireland. Her father was a soldier from County Donegal. She was the eldest of five and had endured an erratic youth. She left convent school and started drinking alcohol and taking drugs when she was fifteen. At this age she spent time in a mental hospital. After time in hospital and a belated graduation, Coughlan decided to leave home. In the mid-1970s, she moved to London, England, where she married Fintan Coughlan and had three children. In 1981, she left her husband and took custody of her children. In 1984, she moved back to her hometown of Galway. On her return to Ireland, when she started to perform in public, she was noticed by Dutch musician and producer Erik Visser. Musical career Vlado Kreslin and Mary Coughlan Visser, whose band Flairck was popular in Europe, helped Coughlan record her first album, Tired and Emotional. Visser went on to become her long-term collaborator. The album sold an unexpected 100,000 copies in Ireland, partly because of an appearance on The Late Late Show. Despite problems, Coughlan continued to reap praise for her recording output on WEA. On Under the Influence (1987) she sang the 1948 Peggy Lee hit \\"Don't Smoke in Bed\\" and the Billie Holiday ballad \\"Good Morning Heartache\\", as well as Jimmy McCarthy's \\"Ride On\\", which reached number 5 on the Irish pop charts in 1987. In 1988 she made her acting debut in Neil Jordan's High Spirits. She lost her record contract with Warner Music Group. In 1990, she signed with East West Records, which released her third album, Uncertain Pleasures, recorded in the UK and produced by Peter Glenister, former music director for Terence Trent D'Arby. It included compositions by Mark Nevin and cover versions of the Rolling Stones' \\"Mother's Little Helper\\" and Elvis Presley's \\"Heartbreak Hotel.\\" After receiving treatment, it seemed as though Coughlan had landed on her feet again. Sentimental Killer (1992) and Love for Sale (1993) were received well. In 1994, she lent her vocals to A Woman's Heart Vol.2 album with Mary Black and Dolores Keane. She released Live in Galway and in 1997 After the Fall, which became her American debut. In June 2000, Coughlan took another turn in her career when she presented a series of multimedia shows in Dublin and London celebrating Billie Holiday, a singer whose life had parallels to Coughlan's. Material from these shows was collected on Mary Coughlan Sings Billie Holiday. In April 2001 Long Honeymoon was released, and in 2002 Red Blues. She appeared on the RT√â reality television charity show Celebrity Farm. The House of Ill Repute was released in 2008. She participated in the album Sanctuary with Moya Brennan. Woman Undone In 2018, Coughlan collaborated with the Brokentalkers and Valgeir Sigur√∞sson, to create a fusion of theatre, music and dance to re-imagine her extraordinary life and her difficult childhood. It tells the story of a young woman who endured abuse, addiction and mental illness and whose discovery of art and music was her redemption. The premiere took place at Projects Art Centre, Dublin, featuring Mary Coughlan alongside female quartet Mongoose performing an original score by Valgeir Sigur√∞sson which fuses electronic music with live instrumentation and a haunting vocal score. Woman Undone was nominated in two categories for the Irish Times Theatre Awards: Best Sound for Mary Coughlan, Mongoose and Valgeir Sigur√∞sson; Best Movement: Eddie Kay Personal life After Tired and Emotional, Coughlan faced mismanagement of her career. She lost her car, house, and recording contract with Warner Music. She drank alcohol excessively and was hospitalized more than thirty times. She recovered in 1994 and had two children with Frank Bonadio. A public spat with singer Sin√©ad O'Connor ensued over Bonadio's affections. Coughlan has spoken about abortion and the role of women in Irish society. In September 2017, she walked out of an interview with Newstalk presenter George Hook in response to comments made by the presenter about rape victims.

They are normally organized at company and battalion levels, and fall under the responsibility of the unit's commanding officer. FRG's are established to provide activities and support to enhance the flow of information, increase the resiliency of unit soldiers and their families, provide practical tools for adjusting to military deployments and separations, and enhance the well- being and esprit de corps within the unit. Since one of the goals of an FRG is to support the military mission through provision of support, outreach, and information to family members, certain FRG activities are essential and common to all groups, and include member meetings, staff and committee meetings, publication and distribution of newsletters, maintenance of virtual FRG websites, maintenance of updated rosters and readiness information, and member telephone trees and e-mail distribution lists. All army units, both active and reserve, sponsor FRGs as an avenue of mutual support and assistance, and as a network of communications among the family members, the chain of command, chain of concern, and community resources. The FRG also provides feedback to the command on the state of the unit \\"family\\" and is considered a unit commander‚Äôs program. FRGs developed out of military family support groups as well as less formal officer and enlisted wives clubs, telephone and social rosters, volunteer groups, and clubs.

The film is loosely based on the eponymous 1986 book by British crime writer Ruth Rendell. Plot Madrid, Christmas 1970. The Spanish State has declared a state of emergency curtailing civil liberties. A young prostitute, Isabel Plaza Caballero, gives birth on a bus to a son she names V√≠ctor. Twenty years later, V√≠ctor Plaza shows up for a date with Elena, a junkie with whom he had sex a week earlier. Elena is waiting for her drug dealer to arrive and orders V√≠ctor to leave, eventually threatening him with a gun. Enraged, V√≠ctor wrestles the gun from her; in the process Elena gets knocked out, and the gun goes off. A neighbour hears the shot and calls the police. Two cops respond to the report. The older cop, Sancho, is an unstable alcoholic who suspects his wife Clara of infidelity. The younger cop, David, is clean-cut and sober. Through the window they catch sight of V√≠ctor physically struggling with Elena. Sancho is ready to storm the apartment, while David wants to call for a back-up. When they enter, V√≠ctor holds Elena hostage at gunpoint. David tries to calm him down and get him to drop his gun, but Sancho sabotages his efforts by repeatedly threatening V√≠ctor. Finally, David puts his gun to Sancho's head and gets first Sancho and then V√≠ctor to put down their guns. David orders Elena to flee. Sancho then lunges for V√≠ctor, and as they wrestle for the gun it fires. Two years later, V√≠ctor, in jail, watches a wheelchair basketball match. David, now partially paralyzed from the gunshot two years earlier, is a star player in the 1992 Summer Paralympics. Elena, now his wife, cheers him on from the sidelines. V√≠ctor has made good use of his time in jail, taking a correspondence course in education, working out, and enriching his mind with a variety of subjects, including the Bible. Four years later, he is released. His mother has died, leaving him some money and a house in an area scheduled for demolition. V√≠ctor visits his mother's grave, where he encounters Elena at her father's burial service. Without identifying himself, he briefly offers her his condolences. Before leaving the cemetery he encounters Sancho's wife Clara, who has arrived too late for Elena's service. They leave together and she visits his apartment. They establish a tentative relationship. Elena, now off drugs and operating an orphanage, tells David of her encounter with V√≠ctor. David stops by V√≠ctor's house and warns him not to go near his wife. V√≠ctor challenges him to prevent him from doing whatever he wants, but David punches him below the belt. David leaves, but he sees Clara arriving and watches from a distance. Clara, drawn by V√≠ctor's enthusiasm and good looks, agrees to teach him how to make love while pampering him with gifts and affection. She eventually falls in love with him. V√≠ctor is accepted as a volunteer by the orphanage, which accepts the qualifications he earned in prison and discovers he is very good with the children. Elena objects, but can offer no compelling argument against V√≠ctor. David continues to trail V√≠ctor and discovers that he works at his wife's orphanage. He confronts V√≠ctor again, and V√≠ctor denies responsibility for firing the shot that put him in a wheelchair. He demonstrates how Sancho made him squeeze the trigger because Sancho knew David was having an affair with Clara. Afterwards, David tells his wife what V√≠ctor said, admitting that he was having an affair with Clara. Elena is disgusted, but still plans to leave the orphanage to get away from V√≠ctor. V√≠ctor tells Elena that his original plan of revenge was to become the world's greatest lover, make love to Elena all night long, and then abandon her, but that he now loves her too much to do so. V√≠ctor tells Clara that they should stop meeting, and they break up. While V√≠ctor is working overnight at the orphanage, Elena arrives to remove her belongings and offers V√≠ctor a night of passion on condition he never contacts her again. Elena then tells David about this night of infidelity. She tells him she will remain his wife because he needs her more than V√≠ctor does. David is nevertheless intent on avenging himself against V√≠ctor. Clara, unable to bear Sancho's abuse any longer, leaves him in a violence scene, leaving him bloodied. David arrives and helps Sancho clean his wounds before showing Sancho photographs he has been taking of V√≠ctor and Clara. Sancho and David drive to V√≠ctor's house, arriving just as Clara has finished writing V√≠ctor a farewell letter. Sancho and Clara hold each other at gunpoint and fire. Clara falls dead and Sancho is wounded. Sancho finally kills himself. At the end, David narrates a letter written to his wife from Miami, where he is spending Christmas with some friends, apologizing for the way everything turned out. At the orphanage, a pregnant Elena goes into labor and on the way to the hospital, she and V√≠ctor get stuck in heavy traffic. V√≠ctor is reminded of the circumstances of his own birth, and tells his unborn child that the Spanish people no longer live in fear as they did at the time of his birth.

Separated by Snapper Rocks and Rainbow Bay to the west, with Duranbah Beach and the Tweed River mouth to the south, present-day Point Danger has also indicated the border between New South Wales and Queensland, Australia, since 1863. The point is the location of the Captain Cook memorial and lighthouse, the Centaur Memorial and Walk of Remembrance, the Marine Rescue NSW Point Danger station, and the southern end of the Gold Coast Oceanway. The Centaur Memorial remembers the sinking of Australian Hospital Ship Centaur by a Japanese submarine on 14 May 1943. The Walk of Remembrance commemorates other ships lost to Japanese and German action during World War II and takes the form of plaques arranged in a semicircle around the lookout fence. History Captain James Cook, upon encountering the eastern Australian coast and naming Rame Head (Victoria), then sailed up the coast to the famous Botany Bay. Continuing North from there, at about 5 pm on 16 May 1770 (log date) he encountered the reefs that run east from Fingal Head and Cook Island. To avoid these reefs, formed by a lava flow from Mount Warning, Cook was forced to change his course to the east. Cook's log indicates his ship was \\"about 5 miles from the land\\". However having to pull away to the east to avoid the reefs, that we now know only run to sea from Cook Island, would indicate Cook was much closer to the point he named Point Danger. The next morning, (same log date 16 May) James Cook, although much further out to sea, recorded the location of the reefs and named the point off which the island and reefs lie - Point Danger. He wrote: > We now saw the breakers again they lay two Leagues from a point under which > is a small Island, their situation may always be found by the peaked > mountain before mentioned from them this mountain or hill, and on this > account I have named Mount Warning it lies 7 or 8 Leagues inland the land is > high and hilly about it, but it is conspicuous enough to be distinguished > from everything else. The point off which these shoals lay I have named > Point Danger. These reefs are now named Danger Reefs and comprise Inner Reef, South Reef and Outer Reef.Australian Hydrographic Chart \\"AUS 813\\" There has been controversy over the naming of Point Danger for many years. It seems the controversy began as early as 1823, when government surveyor, John Oxley, set out in HMCS Mermaid to explore Port Curtis, the site of Gladstone. Oxley explored Moreton Bay, which had been named by Captain Cook, and the Brisbane River, as well as exploring and naming the Tweed River. It was during this voyage that Oxley encountered what is now known as Fingal Head and reported it as being Point Danger, so named by Captain James Cook.Oxley's manuscript 31 October 1823Report of the Counselor's Committee 3 February 1971 - M.L.Document 1723 - Archives Authority of NSW>A view which Captain Phillip Parker King concurred with. Oxley's favourable report on the Brisbane River saw him return the following year and establish the colony of Brisbane under the direction of Sir Thomas Brisbane, Governor of New South Wales in 1824. Fingal Head At some time in 1828 Henry John Rous, travelling north, charted the Tweed River, which he named the Clarence River, unaware that it had already been named the Tweed River by Oxley in 1823.HMS Rainbow's Log: dated 21 August 1828 - PRO 5752 51/3381 Rous came up the eastern coastline and around the reef off the coast of the feature now known Fingal Head, and arrived at a place called Rainbow Bay, so named after his ship. It was there that Henry Rous has arguably caused all of the confusion. He named the, at the time, unnamed site of Point Danger as being that of Cook's Point Danger. There was further confusion as to the location of Cook's Point Danger when in 1840 surveyor Robert Dixon was given the task of doing the first land survey of the area. Dixon's role was to map the New South Wales and Queensland border. He was told to map the border from the west to Point Danger on the east coast. Dixon took the location of Cook's Point Danger as being that of the one identified by Rous in 1828 rather than the one identified by Oxley in 1823. In 1970, on the 200th anniversary of Cook's naming of Point Danger and given that the location seemed to be correct, a memorial was placed at the current site and the New South Wales, Queensland and Federal governments combined to erect the Point Danger Captain Cook Memorial Lighthouse. However, in 1971, the following year, after much debate about the location of Cook's Point Danger and the Queensland-New South Wales border, the Geographical Names Board declared: > little doubt exists that the feature named Point Danger by Captain Cook was > in actual fact the feature now known as Fingal Head. However, as the name > has been known in its present position for over 130 years and having in mind > the wording of the letters Patent of 6 June 1859, in which the position of > the QLD-New South Wales border is linked with the position of Point Danger, > the Board is not prepared to assign the name to any feature or position > other than that to which it is currently located. The misnaming obviously raised a significant constitutional issue. Yet despite this pronouncement, some 18 years later debate was still continuing. In November 1989 the Geographical Names Board approved a historical re-enactment of Cook's voyage. The research for the re-enactment led to Acting Chief Surveyor Ron Benjamin finding that: > From the re-enactment voyage, I now have no doubt that Captain Cook's, > 'point of land under which lies a small island', was intended to be today's > Fingal Head. However, in 1998, following another review, the New South Wales Geographic Names Board, it was concluded, in part: > From an analysis of Cook‚Äôs Private Log, the Official Log of the 'Endeavour', > Cook‚Äôs Journal and the journals of Cook‚Äôs Officers, and relating the > analysis to modern nautical charts and maps of the area, it is suggested > that the following conclusions be drawn: 5\\\\. It is the opinion of the > Geographic Names Board Committee therefore that the present Point Danger is > correctly designated.'' The matter did not finish there however. Many were unhappy with a conclusion that appeared to be so at odds with the historical facts and agitation continued. Trevor Lipscombe, in closely tracking Cook's voyage and ground- truthing the places he named, concluded in On Austral Shores (2005), that: > There can be little doubt that Fingal Head is Cook‚Äôs Point DangerLipscombe > 2005, p. 227 In 2007, at Ken Gold's behest, Dr Nigel Erskine of the Australian National Maritime Museum reviewed the argument put forward by the Geographic Names Board.Dr. Nigel Erskine's (Curator Exploration Australian National Maritime Museum) report dated 8 March 2007. As a result of Gold's representations, and support from a number of authorities, Mr Chris Hartcher was able to rise and inform the Parliament of New South Wales on 9 April 2008: > that today the Geographical Names Board has considered Mr Gold's efforts and > announced that the official records for Point Danger and Fingal Head will be > changed to reflect both the historical versions of the naming of Cook's > Point Danger.\\"Cook's Point Danger\\" Geographical Names Board of NSW - ISBN > o-7313-8831-3 Lighthouse The lighthouse/Cook Memorial was finished in 1971.

It was originally built in 1883 as a residence for Robert McHenry, a prominent local resident. History In 1880, Robert McHenry purchased five lots on the corner of 15th and I street in Modesto, California for what would become the McHenry Mansion. McHenry hired Jeremiah Robinson, a Stockton contractor, to design and construct the mansion. Construction of the McHenry Mansion began in 1882 and was completed in 1883. The mansion was constructed in the High Victorian Italianate style that was popular at the time. After construction, Robert McHenry lived in the mansion with his wife, Matilda until his death in 1890. With the death of Matilda in 1896, their son, Oramil McHenry, moved into the mansion with his wife Louise and their three children. After their divorce in 1901, Oramil married a woman named Myrtie Conneau in 1902. Conneau came into ownership of the McHenry mansion following Oramil's death in 1906 due to stomach cancer. The McHenry Mansion changed ownership again when Myrtie remarried William Langdon in 1908. Subsequently, the mansion became the Elmwood Sanitarium in 1919, then the Langdon apartments in 1923. The McHenry Mansion continued to be used as an apartment building until 1976, when it came on the market. At the time, Modesto was rapidly losing much of its historical architecture, so Aileen and Julio Gallo purchased the mansion through the Julio R. Gallo Foundation to preserve it. The McHenry Mansion was restored and opened to the public in 1983 and has since been open as a historical landmark with available tours. In 2011 the front of the McHenry Mansion was damaged in a major fire and has since been restored to its original state.http://www.mchenrymansion.org/history.html ReferencesBibliographyExternal links *Official site *McHenry Museum Official Site *HistoricModesto.com Category:Historic house museums in California Category:Museums in Stanislaus County, California Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:History of Stanislaus County, California Category:Buildings and structures in Modesto, California Category:Italianate architecture in California Category:Victorian architecture in California Category:Houses in Stanislaus County, California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Stanislaus County, California ","title":"McHenry Mansion"},{"id":"3950309","text":"NSGA Galeta seen in July 2005 MCSF CO Panama- Marines step off on night patrol early 1991 NSGA Galeta Island Galeta Island is an island located on the Atlantic side of the Republic of Panama just east of the city of Col√≥n, Panama.

Background Daniels attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where he wrote his master's thesis on Frankenstein, and he worked as a musician and as a journalist.Daniels, Les. The Black Castle (1978, Charles Scribner's Sons, NY), jacket bio. Career He was the author of five novels featuring the vampire Don Sebastian de Villanueva, a cynical, amoral and misanthropic Spanish nobleman whose predatory appetites pale into insignificance compared with the historical catastrophes which he witnesses in his periodic reincarnations. These include: the Spanish Inquisition in The Black Castle (1978); the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs in The Silver Skull (1979); and the French Revolution's Reign of Terror in Citizen Vampire (1981). In the later novels Yellow Fog (1986, revised 1988) and No Blood Spilled (1991), Sebastian is resurrected in Victorian London and India, where the horror of his vampirism is again contrasted with non-supernatural evil, now in the person of Sebastian's human enemy, Reginald Callender. A sixth (and presumably final) Don Sebastian novel set in Tibet and entitled White Demon was planned and is advertised by some sources as being available for purchase, but in fact was never completed: Daniels had begun writing it before abandoning it due to the demands of his non-fiction projects and was told when able to resume that his publisher had lost interest. Daniels also worked with the historical fiction genre. The Black Castle features appearances by Torquemada and Columbus; in The Silver Skull Sebastian confronts Hern√°n Cort√©s; in Citizen Vampire he has a couple of friendly encounters with the Marquis de Sade; and Madame Tussaud makes an appearance in Yellow Fog. Daniels described his works as \\"tragedy, in which evil consumes itself\\", as opposed to the melodrama of most contemporary horror novels, in which \\"customarily good guys meet bad guys and win in two out of three falls\\".Daniels, Yellow Fog (1986), author's introduction He cited Robert Bloch as an influence on his sardonic style, and was an enthusiast of the works of John Dickson Carr, who in several of his own works combined historical fiction with horror and the detective story.S.

It was an attempt to say, 'Look, here's what has been done in the medium.' I didn't sit down and talk to creators at great length or anything like that.\\" Both Comix and the more extensively researched Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics ‚Äì Marvel (1991) were written with a general audience in mind, in the hopes of educating both comic book fans and those unfamiliar with the medium.

Officially opened in March 2003, the Academy of Light is a state-of-the-art training facility in Cleadon - just north of Sunderland. It covers an area of of which 60 acres dedicated to football. It replaced the aging Charlie Hurley Centre, located nearby. The site is used as the primary training facility for the first team, but is also used to train the youngsters in Sunderland's U23 and U18 teams, it's the location of Sunderland's U18 home games, and is also the home of Sunderland A.F.C. Ladies. The academy plans were the focus of protests from local residents who were angered at the development on a green belt. After withdrawing initial ambitious plans, the club submitted new plans in 1999 which were rejected by South Tyneside Council. Following a public inquiry, Sunderland launched a successful appeal, and work began on the Academy in 2001. Before building work was complete, Sunderland submitted plans for expansion to the site, to include indoor training facilities, which The Football Association had added to the list of necessary facilities for academies to achieve Category 1 status. Plans were rejected, and a further appeal was also rejected, meaning Sunderland were forced to use a disused ice rink in Sunderland City Centre for indoor training. Indoor facilities were finally added to the Academy of Light in an expansion completed in 2012. The initial site cost over ¬£10 million to build, with the indoor training facility expansion costing an extra ¬£3m. Proposal and construction In 1997 Sunderland A.F.C. moved to a new home (the Stadium of Light) and club owner Bob Murray put forward proposals for a new world-class academy with the aim of securing Sunderland's long-term future. The academy was to be built on acquired land opposite Sunderland's current training ground, on disused farmland in an area known as Whitburn Moor. From the outset, the proposals were beset with problems. Sunderland's training ground was on the green belt between Sunderland and South Shields. Planning permission for building on the green belt is only granted in exceptional circumstances. Sunderland's original plans were ambitious - among them, the club planned to build an indoor training centre and hostel. Local opposition was fierce, claiming that an area of rural wildlife would be destroyed and the green belt would be weakened, causing a merging of the conurbations of City of Sunderland and South Tyneside. A residents protest group, called the Green Belt Action Group (GBAG) were formed. Sunderland were forced to withdraw the submission. =Revised plans= In 1999 the club resubmitted a proposal, for the same site as the previous plan, but in which the height of the new developments would not be built any higher than the existing agricultural buildings. New lighting technology would reduce the effect of floodlights on the local area, and extensive re-seeding would benefit wildlife on the site. In total, the Academy would have a 12% smaller 'footprint' than the original farm buildings. The club also stated that ten sites around Sunderland and County Durham had been assessed but were found to be unsuitable. Despite being recommended for acceptance by planning inspectors, the Local Planning Authority rejected the proposal on the grounds that it encroached on the green belt. Sunderland appealed, and following a public inquiry in September 1999, the Secretary of State for the Environment John Prescott overturned the ruling in February 2000, stating that the benefits the Academy would bring to the community and region justified building on the green-belt. He was convinced that Sunderland had rigorously investigated alternative sites, and he went on to say that the green-belt would not be in danger, as the site had a smaller footprint than the previous site layout. Following the ruling, the GBAG continued to protest against the plans. They felt the landscaping plans would ruin the 'rural' appearance of the area, and the fencing and mounding would create a 'visual barrier'. One of their biggest criticisms was that Sunderland were 'moving the goalposts', as their building plans were significantly different from those originally submitted in 1999. In 2001, detailed building plans were rejected by South Tyneside Metropolitan Borough Council's planning committee, again on grounds on green belt encroachment. Sunderland appealed, and a month later planning permission was given. Work began in November 2001, marked by a ground-breaking ceremony in January 2002 with England national football team manager Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson. =Construction and further controversy= Shortly after beginning construction work, Sunderland enraged the site protesters by resubmitted plans for further amendments to the site. The addition of an indoor 'training barn' and an on-site hostel were seen by Sunderland to be essential requirements to keeping the site at Academy status. Sunderland claimed that in 1999 these elements were desired but unrealistic, but in 2001 they had been added to the list of essential Academy elements by the FA in their new Elite Player Performance Plan, and therefore to retain Academy status, Sunderland were obliged to include them in the plans. Sunderland submitted the application in May 2002, and in August the plans were rejected by South Tyneside council, who said: We felt they were inappropriate for the green belt. Again Sunderland appealed, and a public inquiry was launched in April 2003. In November of that year, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott rejected Sunderland's revised plans claiming the new elements would \\"cause significant harm to the openness and visual amenity of this sensitive part of the green belt.\\" This ruling came despite Sunderland's argument that similar green belt developments at Manchester United, Arsenal and Middlesbrough had been accepted. By this point, the initial phase of the academy had been built, with area set aside for the proposed indoor barn and hostel. The ruling meant that in order to retain Academy status, Sunderland would have to find alternative sites for those elements of the academy, or abandon and relocate the entire centre. In January 2004 Sunderland City Council came to the rescue of Sunderland by offering the ice rink at the Crowtree Leisure Centre as a site for the indoor training area. The rink, in the centre of the city, was leased to Sunderland AFC for an initial two-years. The offer effectively saved the club's Academy status. = Indoor Facility Expansion = In 2009, plans were once again submitted for indoor training facilities, due to the impending closure of the Crowtree Leisure Centre. Chairman Niall Quinn announced proposals for a training barn which, following extensive consultation with local residents, would be built 5 metres lower than the original plan, making it no higher than the other academy buildings. The plans were approved in 2010 and a ¬£3m indoor extension to the site was finally opened on 7 December 2012 by Trevor Brooking. The indoor facility is 82.4m wide, 64m long, and has an internal clearance of 10m. It has a translucent PVC roof to allow the 3G Artificial turf pitch to be illuminated by natural light. Academy status The club gained Category 1 (Elite) academy status despite not having an indoor training pitch onsite, as a result Sunderland compete in the Professional Development League as a Category 1 (Elite) academy. These requirements for Category 1, as outlined in the Elite Player Performance Plan, are wide-reaching, and include indoor and outdoor training facilities, education provisions, and dedicated youth training areas. Academy status is regularly assessed, and Sunderland maintained their status when assessed in 2013. Following Sunderland's relegation to EFL League One in 2018, they became the only club with a Category 1 academy outside of the top two divisions of English football. The club was purchased by Stewart Donald in May 2018 and he revealed that the cost of maintaining Category 1 status was ¬£4m per year. Despite this, Donald insisted that maintaining Sunderland's category 1 academy status was a priority. Environmental development During construction, Sunderland enlisted the help of famous Ecologist David Bellamy to advise in the development of the area surrounding the academy. Wetland was introduced, and water used to wet the pitches at the academy is recycled back into these wetlands. A large area of woodland was also planted, using a variety of tree types. The academy area only accounts for of the site. The remainder is a wildlife preserve.

It is currently owned by the city of Ormond Beach and is used as a cultural center and park. It is located on a barrier island within the city limits, overlooking the Halifax River, which is now part of the Florida Intracoastal Waterway. History The mansion was built in 1914 for the Rev. Harwood Huntington of New Haven, Connecticut. It was named for the many casement windows incorporated into the design of the building, which helped keep the interior cool in spite of Florida's subtropical climate. =The Rockefeller era= Its most famous resident, John D. Rockefeller, purchased the home as his winter residence in 1918. Rockefeller was seventy-eight years old when he moved into the Casements. He became known in the area for his elaborate Christmas parties, his love of golf, and for handing out dimes to his neighbors or visitors. During a golf game with Harvey Firestone, the tire magnate made such a good shot that Rockefeller decided he deserved a dime and handed one to his somewhat embarrassed guest. Over the years, Rockefeller was visited at The Casements by such luminaries as Edward, Prince of Wales, Henry Ford, and Will Rogers, who once quipped, \\"I‚Äôm glad you won (at golf) today, Mr. Rockefeller. The last time you lost, the price of gasoline went up!\\"Florida: A Guide to the Southern-Most State, by Federal Writers' Project, page 342. Guests at The Casements received a poem along with their new dime. This poem is believed to have been written by Rockefeller: > I was early taught to work as well as play; My life has been one long, happy > holiday‚ÄîFull of work and full of play‚ÄîI dropped the worry on the way, And > God was good to me every day. It was in this home that Rockefeller eventually died in his sleep on the morning of May 23, 1937. The Rockefeller family sold The Casements in 1941. =Later history= Over the next 20 years, The Casements served as a girls' preparatory school and a home for the elderly. In 1959 the property was purchased by the Hotel Ormond Corporation with plans for development, but those plans never materialized. In 1972, The Casements was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The next year, it was purchased by the city of Ormond Beach, which eventually restored it to serve as a cultural and community center. In 2009 The Casements underwent a $1.1 million renovation project.http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/volusia/orl-casements- rockefeller-mansion-051409,0,4609528.story The gardens The Casements gardens are an authentic restoration of a two-acre garden along the Halifax riverfront that belonged to John D.

D. Salinger, originally published in Harper's in April 1949, and included in the compilation, Nine Stories.Salinger, J.D. Nine Stories. Boston: Little, Brown and Company.1953. Written in the summer of 1948 at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin,Slawenski, 2010, p. 174 the story marks a shift away from Salinger's literary misanthropy, which had largely been informed by his horrific combat experiences in Europe during World War II,Slawenski, 2010, p. 173 and toward a ‚Äúreaffirmation‚Äù of human interdependence Slawenski, 2010, p. 173-174 and spiritual reawakening.Slawenski, 2010, p. 176 The piece includes ‚ÄúBoo Boo‚Äù Glass Tannenbaum, one of the key members of Salinger's fictional Glass family, and makes reference to two of her brothers, Seymour Glass (deceased) and Webb ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù Glass. Plot summary Told in two distinct segments, the first involves a discussion between two house servants about their employer's little boy, who has a history of running away. The second segment explores the mother's efforts to reassure her son and help him cope with his fears.Slawenski, 2010, p. 174 - 175 The story opens with the two house servants, Mrs. Snell and Sandra, discussing the homeowner's young son, Lionel. Sandra is very worried that Lionel will tell Boo Boo (Mrs. Tannenbaum), her employer, that Sandra has made some anti-Semitic remarks about Lionel's Jewish father (‚Äúgonna have a nose just like his father‚Äù Slawenski, 2010, p. 174). Boo Boo finds Lionel in a dinghy preparing to cast off, and refuses to allow his mother to join him. Boo Boo pretends to be admiral of the imaginary ship in order to win Lionel over and discover why he is trying to run away. He resists, even going so far as to throw his uncle Seymour's old goggles into the lake. Lionel tells Boo Boo that Sandra called his father a \\"big sloppy kike\\".Salinger, 1949, p. 86 While he doesn't know what this ethnic slur means, conflating the epithet ‚Äúkike‚Äù with ‚Äúkite‚Äù, he nevertheless grasps its derogatory connotation. Boo Boo, in an effort to reassure the boy and help him cope with the episode, succeeds in providing him insights into her own needs and the love she feels for him. At the end of the story, they race across the beach toward home, and Lionel wins. Analysis  The story, originally titled ‚ÄúKiller in the Dinghy‚Äù Slawenski, 2010, p. 174 contains some clearly autobiographical elements.Slawenski, 2010, p. 176 Salinger (who was called ‚ÄúSonny‚Äù by his family) Slawenski, 2010, p. 172 resembles Boo Boo Tannenbaum's four-year-old son, Lionel, in that he ‚Äúhad a habit of running away from home when confronted by conflict.‚Äù Slawenski, 2010, p. 172 Solidifying this association beyond any doubt, Salinger describes Lionel wearing a ‚ÄúJerome the Ostrich‚Äù T-shirt ‚Äì Salinger's first name is Jerome.Slawenski, 2010, p. 174 Lionel's mother, \\"Boo Boo\\", employing great tact, succeeds in conveying to her son a simple and profound truth: fear and isolation can only be overcome through mutual support with other people.Slawenski, 2010, p. 175-176 The tale also addresses the issue of anti-Semitism Slawenski, 2010, p. 174 in the post- war period when the facts of fascist atrocities committed against minorities, including Jews, were becoming fully understood. Salinger had personally viewed a Nazi concentration camp as a US soldier.Slawenski, 2010, p. 161, p. 173, p. 176 While attending Eastern upper-middle-class private schools as a boy, Salinger, half-Jewish, had been exposed to ethnic stereotyping by his mostly Anglo-Saxon classmates.Slawenski, 2010, p. 176 \\"Down at the Dinghy\\" is not a reckoning of these personal and historical events, but rather a ‚Äúreaffirmation of the faith in human connection‚Äù based upon Slawenski, 2010, p. 176 Characters *Boo Boo: Many allusions are made to Boo Boo throughout the Glass saga, although she is rarely encountered in any of the other stories, such as Franny and Zooey, or Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction.

Firstly, by Boakes' own company, Darkling Room, in a limited \\"Pins & Needles\\" edition, and later by Iceberg Interactive, as part of their Adventures in Terror: British Horror Collection. The game was made available on Steam in December 2013. The game tells the story of an unnamed protagonist who receives a frightened message from his brother asking for help. Encountering an ancient evil known as the Dark Fall, which traps souls between the realm of the living and the dead and feeds off their pain, the protagonist must attempt to imprison it before he too is overcome by its power. Dark Fall received mixed reviews with critics praising the individual work put into the game by Boakes and finding the tone of the game unsettling. Common criticisms included poor graphics and an over-reliance on finding notes to progress the story. The game was followed by three further Dark Fall games. Dark Fall II - Lights Out tells an unrelated story to the first game, although it does feature a recurring minor character. Dark Fall - Lost Souls also tells a relatively unrelated story, although it is set in the same location and features several of the supporting characters from the original game. Dark Fall - Ghost Vigil tells a new story, featuring a ghost hunting paranormal team investigating Harwood House, but reflects game play elements from Dark Fall - The Journal, whilst also connecting The Lost Crown game by the same author.  Gameplay  HUD. Items acquired by the player are shown in the \\"Activity Bar\\" across the top. The cursor is towards the lower right in its neutral style. Dark Fall is a first-person psychological horror/adventure game, which employs a very simple HUD. At the top of the screen is the \\"Activity Bar.\\" On the left side of the bar are items which the player has acquired during the game. On the right, are buttons which allow the player to save their game, quit their game, or load a previously saved game. The game uses a basic point-and-click interface to move the player around and manipulate the game world, which is presented entirely through static pre-rendered images. As the player moves the cursor around the screen it can change into different styles depending on the situation; neutral cursor (no interaction is possible), an arrow (the player can move in the direction indicated), a finger (indicating an item with which the player can directly interact), a wrench (the player must use an inventory item to initiate interaction), a magnifying glass (an area which can be examined in more detail), backwards arrow (the player can move backwards whilst facing the same direction; i.e. they do not have to turn around). Much of the gameplay is based around solving puzzles (such as translating an encrypted message, or opening a puzzle box). However, unlike most modern adventure games, Dark Fall does not keep note of any information or clues acquired by the player (for example, notes found by the player are not entered into the inventory, and journal entries read by the player are not recorded in any way). This forces the player to keep track of every clue and detail themselves. If the player wishes to recheck a journal entry, they must find the journal and re-read it.  Plot  The game begins on April 29, with the player (who remains unnamed) receiving a message from his brother, Pete Crowhurst, an architect working on the redevelopment of an abandoned train station and hotel in Dowerton, Dorset. Pete pleads for his brother to come to Dowerton, as something is wrong and he needs help. He mentions he is working with two ghost hunters, and says \\"I think whatever they were hunting has found them. I think it's found me, too.\\" He then says \\"it\\" is outside the door, whispering his name, and he feels compelled to let it in. As the message ends, a door is heard opening. The player heads to Dowerton by train. He falls asleep, and awakens in a train tunnel, where he hears the voice of a young boy, Timothy Pike. The boy guides him to the station, telling him he has lived in the area \\"since 41,\\" and mentioning \\"the others are hoping you can help them. One of them knows you, your brother ain't it? He's the new one, only just arrived.\\" He also says \\"it\\" doesn't know they're talking yet, but soon will. The player finds Pete's PDA, in which he writes about Nigel Danvers and Polly White, the ghost hunters. As the player explores the hotel, he discovers why it originally closed; its reputation never recovered from the night of April 29, 1947, when the guests and staff vanished. As the player explores, it becomes apparent the area is haunted by the spirits of the people who vanished in 1947, amongst others (including a Roundhead soldier who died in the original inn during the English Civil War, Timothy, Polly, Nigel and Pete). The player learns George Crabtree, the owner of the hotel in 1947, was suspected of murdering the others and then fleeing. However, Crabtree had learned of an evil in the hotel and was planning to imprison it by using twelve symbols to recite an incantation. Each symbol was on a piece of vellum, which he distributed amongst the staff and guests, most of whom thought he was mad. The player discovers \\"it\\" is known as the Dark Fall, and was accidentally released by Crabtree and his friend Arthur while they were in the cellar trying to solve the mystery of the disappearance of the soldier from the Civil War. In his journal, Crabtree writes, Arthur enlisted in the army, and was killed during World War II, but Crabtree worked to re-imprison the Dark Fall. In a journal entry dated April 29, 1947, he writes he is ready to use the symbols to recite the incantation. The player also finds Polly's electronic journal, in which she writes Nigel discovered a secret room in the cellar. However, several days later, they feel a \\"conscious\\" presence outside their door; Polly hears it calling her name, but Nigel hears it calling his. In her last entry, dated April 29, she says Nigel disappeared as they were fleeing from the cellar, and although she was able to get back to their room, she has decided to go out and look for Nigel and Pete. The player ultimately finds his way into the antechamber and discovers the final journal entries of Crabtree, who speculates the Dark Fall may be connected to Hela, the being appointed by the Norse god Odin to guard the souls of the dead, but writes \\"if so, I fear that this 'guardian' gave up watching over the dead, and has acquired a taste for the living.\\" He had come to believe the Dark Fall sustains itself on the pain of the souls it has trapped. In his final entry, Crabtree worries he may be incapable of imprisoning it. The player enters the central chamber, resisting the Dark Fall, and recites the incantation, imprisoning it, and releasing the trapped souls. Timothy thanks him, and before he departs, tells him things may not have turned out as he thinks. All evidence of the spirits trapped by the Dark Fall throughout history disappear. The game then cuts back to the opening scene, as the player receives a message from Pete. In the message, Pete begins by saying he has something very important to tell his brother, but then forgets why he rang, and says the redevelopment of the hotel is going well, and he will be home shortly. Development and release Dark Fall was written, designed and programmed by Jonathan Boakes, who was working as a sushi chef at the time. He first got the idea for the game whilst exploring a real abandoned train station and adjoining hotel in Dorset in January 2000. The buildings were sealed shut with corrugated iron, but rusted peepholes allowed him to look inside and determine they had been quite opulent in their day, and had last been used in the late 1940s. Upon further investigation, he discovered one of the doors of the train station was so rotted, the weight of the iron had pulled it partly off its hinges, and he was able to get inside and explore the buffet room. Upon returning to his nearby B&B;, he asked the owner, a man named Crabtree, about the hotel and station, but he knew nothing of their history, simply that they were there. It was this air of mystery that first led Boakes to consider a video game in such a setting. He was also inspired by the Sapphire & Steel serial \\"The Railway Station\\", which was set in an abandoned train station and featured \\"two existential 'time agents' [who] visited an old railway station to get to the bottom of a 'time rip'. Something was bringing the dead back into our world as embittered spirits.\\" When he got back to London, he wrote a narrative outline of his proposed game, which he ultimately developed into an unpublished short story called \\"Dark Fall\\". At the same time, he started building locations for the game using macromedia software. On Easter Sunday, he returned to Dorset with a camera, a video camera and tin foil for collecting samples, determined to get further into the buildings. However, he was shocked to discover they were gone; demolished to make way for a housing estate. As such, he had to rely on his imagination to create everything, with the exception of the buffet room, which he based on the actual room he had explored, and the caves under the hotel, which were partly inspired by the Dan yr Ogof caves in Wales. Boakes worked on the game for eighteen months, almost entirely on his own. All of the sound effects in the game were recorded in his own house, and enhanced using Sound Forge. Graphically, the game is presented entirely through pre-rendered static images, some of which feature limited animation. When the game was complete, Boakes published it independently under the XXv Productions label, making only 2000 copies. Although approached by two publishing companies interested in the game, Boakes chose to sell it independently online, where it soon began to attract positive reviews, and generate good word-of-mouth. Boakes was later approached by The Adventure Company, who signed a deal to distribute it globally, renamed Dark Fall: The Journal. In March 2009, Boakes' own company, Darkling Room, published a special Limited \\"Pins & Needles\\" Edition, containing Dark Fall: The Journal and the director's cut of Dark Fall II: Lights Out, walkthroughs for each game, a collection of ghost stories and a Dark Fall soundtrack CD. Limited to 300 copies, each is individually numbered, and signed by Boakes. In December 2009, Iceberg Interactive, who had purchased the rights to the series from The Adventure Company, published Adventures in Terror: British Horror Collection, containing Dark Fall: The Journal, the director's cut of Dark Fall: Lights Out and Shadow Tor Studios' Barrow Hill.  Reception  In March 2004, Lorraine Lue of DreamCatcher Interactive Europe reported that Dark Fall \\"kind of surprised us because it is selling very well worldwide, including Germany and the UK.\\" She attributed this partly to the game's use of atmosphere, rather than violence, to generate fear. In North America, Dark Fall sold 17,828 retail copies during 2003, and another 5,432 in the first two months of 2004. The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" upon its general release in 2003. It holds an aggregate score of 68 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on twenty-three reviews. IGN's Staci Krause scored the game 7.8 out of 10, writing \\"It is rare that a PC game, especially a point and click adventure, can give you that edge of your seat feel. Dark Fall: The Journal, definitely does this. Although it's not the most technologically advanced of games, it has a gripping story coupled with subtle nuances that add a dimension of fear to the experience. Add in some puzzles and a lot of investigating and what you have is a pretty decent game.\\" Adventure Gamers' Evan Dickens was the first professional critic to review the game when Boakes independently released it in 2002. Dickens scored it 3.5 out of 5, writing \\"it shows the dedication of a true adventure fan to his genre and the elements that make an adventure game such an enjoyable experience.\\" He also praised the atmosphere of the game; \\"The best part of Dark Fall is summarized in one word: atmosphere. This game demands that you turn off the lights and turn up the speakers. Boakes has succeeded masterfully at creating a world that is truly creepy.\\" He concluded \\"It's clear that this is not a big-budget professional game that has been beta tested by large groups. There are small annoyances, such as not being able to skip the intro sequence if you select New Game. These are minor quibbles, though, and do not take away from the fact that Dark Fall is involving and intriguing.\\" GameSpot's Scott Osborne scored it 6.4 out of 10, criticizing the low graphical and sound quality, and writing \\"Dark Fall breaks no new ground and puts too much emphasis on puzzles, but its meticulously detailed world and paranormal detective story generally keep things entertaining.\\" Of the general gameplay, he wrote, \\"the game puts too much emphasis on puzzle solving, and some of the puzzles, while quite interesting because of their intricate detail and diversity, can be too obscure and perplexing. It's also a shame that the game so often relies on the old adventure-game clich√© of telling its story through clues offered by written materials.\\" GameSpy's Tom Chick scored it 2 out of 5. He was critical of some of the puzzles; \\"It's driven by the sort of maddening adventure game logic that had a hand in killing the genre. But there's no denying this is part of what defined the genre: clever (and often implausible) solutions from some weird corner of the brain most of us never exercise.\\" He praised the detailed backstory, artwork, atmosphere and sound effects, but criticised the navigation and the graphics; \\"It's old-school gaming at its worst in terms of the limitations of the technology. Dark Fall takes place exclusively on static screens with limited interaction and minimal movement or animation. It's the sort of game where you know early on you're never going to interact with anyone because the engine just won't support it.\\" The editors of Computer Gaming World nominated Dark Fall for their 2003 \\"Adventure Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Uplink: Hacker Elite. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Dark Fall the 86th-best adventure game ever released.

Early life He attended Grossmont High School in El Cajon, California. He attended Grossmont Junior College and then transferred to Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo in 2000. Correia is of Portuguese descent. Professional career San Francisco Giants in 2008 =San Francisco Giants= Correia was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the fourth round (127th overall) of the 2002 MLB Draft. In 2003, Correia became the first player taken in the 2002 MLB Draft to reach the major leagues, when he appeared as a relief pitcher on July 10 against the Colorado Rockies. He allowed one run in 1 innings. In 2004, Baseball America named him the organization's sixth-rated prospect. Correia split the 2004 and 2005 seasons between the Giants and the minor leagues, making 12 big league starts and 16 relief appearances between the two seasons. Going into the 2006 season, Correia competed for the Giants' fifth starter spot with Brad Hennessey and Jamey Wright. Although Correia pitched well in spring training, Wright eventually won the spot, and Correia began the season in Triple-A with the Fresno Grizzlies. Correia was called up to the Giants in April due to injuries and poor performance by the team's bullpen, and was primarily used in middle relief. Correia rejoined the Giants' starting rotation in August 2007. After seven starts and (40 innings), he had a 1.80 ERA. In 2008, Correia was mostly a starter, but had a 6.05 ERA during the season and became a free agent after the season. In parts of six seasons with the Giants, Correia pitched in 46 games, 27 as a starter. His record was 14‚Äì22 and his ERA was 4.59. =San Diego Padres= San Diego Padres in 2009 spring training On December 24, 2008, the San Diego Padres signed Correia to a minor league deal. In 2009, he had a slow start, with an ERA above 5.00. Padres pitching coach Darren Balsley began tweaking his delivery. In June, Correia started to lower his ERA. With the pitchers Jake Peavy and Chris Young on the disabled list, he soon became the ace for the Padres. On June 10, Correia only allowed one run through six strong innings against the Dodgers offense. On September 25, 2009, he allowed six hits and struck out seven batters in a complete game shutout versus the Arizona Diamondbacks; the first of his career. On December 12, 2009, Correia re-signed for a one-year, $3 million contract. On May 9, 2010, he was scratched from a start after his younger brother, Trevor, died after falling from a 60-foot cliff while hiking on Santa Cruz Island. In his two seasons with the Padres, he was 22‚Äì21 with a 4.54 ERA in 61 games (59 as a starter). Pittsburgh Pirates in 2012 =Pittsburgh Pirates= On December 17, 2010, the Pittsburgh Pirates signed Correia to a two-year, $8 million deal. On March 24, 2011, the Pirates named him their Opening Day starter. On July 24, 2012, the Pirates traded for Wandy Rodr√≠guez, who took Correia's spot in the starting rotation. Correia then requested a trade. On August 19, 2012, Correia pitched relief, in the Pirates' 6‚Äì3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals, which lasted 19 innings. The next day he pitched as the starter in a 3‚Äì1 Pirates' loss to the San Diego Padres, making him the first Pirates' pitcher since Pascual P√©rez in 1981 to pitch in relief one day and then start the next day's game. In two seasons with the Pirates, he was 24‚Äì22 with a 4.49 ERA. He started 54 games and appeared in relief in five others. He was selected to represent the Pirates at the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, but did not appear in the game. =Minnesota Twins= Minnesota Twins in 2013 On December 13, 2012, Correia signed a two-year, $10 million deal with the Minnesota Twins. With the Twins, he was 14‚Äì26 with a 4.94 ERA in 54 games (all starts). =Los Angeles Dodgers= On August 9, 2014, Correia was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for a player to be named later or cash. He made just three starts for the Dodgers and was primarily used as a long man out of the bullpen. He was 2‚Äì4 for them, with three of his four losses coming in extra inning games. His ERA was 8.03 as he allowed 22 earned runs to score in just 24.2 innings. =Seattle Mariners= On March 9, 2015, Correia signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners with an invitation to spring training. The Mariners released Correia on March 30 after he failed to make the Opening Day roster.http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/03/mariners-release- kevin-correia.html =Second stint with the Giants= On April 7, 2015, Correia signed a minor league deal to return to the Giants. He declared his free agency on May 31. =Philadelphia Phillies= On June 8, 2015, Correia was signed to a Major League contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was designated for assignment on July 7.

Although there have been many ring-ins and other illegal scams in Australian racing, the Fine Cotton scandal is infamous in Australia due to the involvement of some of racing's elite. Fine Cotton was foaled on 29 November 1976, by Aureo from Cottonpicker by Delta. He was bred by the estate of the late G A Darke and W D Hayne, New South Wales.ASB - Fine Cotton Retrieved on 2009-7-26 Before the race Fine Cotton was a horse of limited abilities that was racing in the southern areas of Queensland. The horse was eligible to race in restricted races (for horses with fewer than a certain number of wins) and even then had a poor record leading up to the substitution. Before the ring-in, Fine Cotton's last race was in a 1,200m Intermediate Handicap at a Doomben Wednesday meeting on 8 August 1984, where he carried 53.5 kg and started at 20‚Äì1. He ran 10th in a field of 12. The scam involved a syndicate said to be headed by former bloodstock agent John Gillespie, which purchased a horse that looked almost identical to Fine Cotton and performed better. Unfortunately for the syndicate, this horse (Dashing Soltaire) was injured and unable to race when the ring-in was due to take place. Having already invested money and gone so far, the syndicate decided to find another horse. With time running out, they purchased a horse called Bold Personality, an open-class horse several grades above Fine Cotton. The syndicate faced a problem in that the horses were different colours. Fine Cotton was an eight-year-old brown gelding and had white markings on his hind legs, whereas Bold Personality was a seven-year-old bay gelding with no markings. To overcome this problem, they applied Clairol hair colouring to Bold Personality with limited success. On race day, having forgotten the peroxide to whiten the legs of Bold Personality, they resorted to crudely applied white paint. These poorly conceived attempts to overcome the discrepancies in appearance between the two horses later served to highlight the amateurish nature of the scheme. Race day The syndicate entered Fine Cotton in a race at Eagle Farm on 18 August 1984. The event chosen was a novice handicap for horses that had won fewer than a set number of races. A horse of Bold Personality's ability was not eligible to race in a restricted novice handicap because he was considered to be an open class horse. Even allowing for the restricted class, Fine Cotton was in such poor form that he was considered to have an outside chance of winning and opened in the betting at odds of 33‚Äì1. As betting continued, money began to be invested on Fine Cotton both at Eagle Farm and at other tracks and TABs throughout the country. Such was the avalanche of money that Fine Cotton/Bold Personality eventually started at 7/2 ($4.50). It is believed the conspirators would have netted more than A$1.5 million if the ring-in had proved successful. This scale of betting plunge was highly unusual, so racing stewards were already suspicious before the race. Bookmakers in Sydney had noticed the unusual change in the odds and voiced their concerns. The word ring-in was mentioned, but nothing was raised with the stewards. By the time the horses had reached the barrier, the whisper had become something more. The race The 2nd Novice Handicap would in ordinary circumstances have been a forgettable event if not for the substitution. The horses entered were up- and-coming horses or older horses of limited ability such as Fine Cotton. The syndicate then waited for the race. The ring-in began slowly, but was quick to pick up pace. The jockey was surprised at how easily the horse worked its way into the race. By the time they reached the corner, the event was a race in two. The early favourite Harbour Gold, which had drifted from fractional odds to 5‚Äì1, clung to the rail, and Bold Personality, racing as Fine Cotton and ridden by apprentice Gus Philpot, claimed him on the outside. From this point on, the race was close. First one then the other hit the front until right on the line, where the ring-in stuck his head out and won by only a short half head from Harbour Gold. Even if he had lost, the suspicions raised would have uncovered the scam. As it was, inquiries were already being undertaken as the place-getters returned to scale. Post-race Suspicious after the huge betting plunge and the seemingly dramatic improvement made by Fine Cotton, racing stewards launched an immediate investigation. As Bold Personality returned to scale, the paint was beginning to run on his leg, something obvious to those nearby. Several members of the crowd began to shout \\"ring- in\\". Stewards stopped payment of bets in the race while they spoke to Fine Cotton's trainer, Hayden Haitana. They requested the registration papers for Fine Cotton so that they could verify the identity of the race winner; however, Haitana absconded from the track without complying with this request and the scam began to fall apart. Bold Personality‚Äîalias Fine Cotton‚Äîwas disqualified, and an official inquiry was opened. With the disqualification, runner-up Harbour Gold was awarded the race, and the many punters who had backed Fine Cotton did not receive any money. Aftermath As a result of the official inquiry, the Queensland Turf Club, the State's principal racing club, \\"warned off\\" (banned) six people for life. They were the organiser John Gillespie, horse trainer Hayden Haitana, businessman Robert North, electrical technician Tommaso Di Luzio, and salesman John Dixon. Gillespie and Haitana also served jail terms.The Age Retrieved on 2009-7-26 In 1998, after being banned for 14 years, Bill and Robbie Waterhouse were allowed back on to Australian racecourses. In November 2013, trainer Hayden Haitana's lifetime ban from entering any racecourse in Australia was lifted by the Queensland All Codes Racing Industry Board which agreed to recommendations made by stewards and the Queensland Thoroughbred Racing Board that Haitana have his warning off removed. The jockey involved, Gus Philpot, was exonerated by the course stewards and continued to ride at race meetings in eastern Australia. As of December 2014, he was a horse trainer with stables in rural Victoria. Fine Cotton died on 20 February 2009, aged 32.

While in college he joined the Army Signal Service, the predecessor of the U.S. Weather Bureau. He graduated from Harvard University in 1885. From 1903 until 1913 he ran the U.S. Weather Bureau in San Francisco. He was also the vice president of the Sierra Club, starting in 1904, and continuing until 1913. In 1913 he became Professor of meteorology at Harvard, and remained there until 1931. During the same period he also served as the director of the Blue Hill Observatory. Among his accomplishments was the invention of a device to prevent frost from harming fruit. He was a pioneer in the use of kites to study conditions at high altitudes. In 1885 at Blue Hill, Boston, he modernized the experiments of Benjamin Franklin by attaching a voltmeter to a kite and measuring the voltage difference between the ground and several hundred feet up. He also made studies of the atmospheric effects of smoke, the connection between the aurora and electricity in the atmosphere, and the dangers posed by lightning. He is the author of a cloud atlas. He is also known for testifying about the potential effects of electrocution (based on his experience with lightning) in 1899 at the first trial to decide if the electric chair was cruel and unusual punishment. His testimony was used against the use of the electric chair for the death penalty. In addition to his work with the weather bureau, McAdie wrote a detailed account of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and compiled a catalog of earthquakes on the Pacific coast. He was married to Mary Randolph Brown McAdie.

He killed a total of four officers in the course of resisting capture, two at his house, and two who tried to apprehend him during an 11-day manhunt in the Beartooth Mountains (near the mouth of Clarks Fork Canyon) of Wyoming. Early life and education Walter Earl Durand was born in 1913 to parents who were farmers in Powell, Wyoming, where he grew up. He learned all about farming and hunting. Mountain man He was a mountain man who lived off the land in the mountains of Wyoming during the years following the Great Depression. He was arrested for poaching elk, as he did not believe in the new hunting license system and refused to get a license. While in jail in Cody, Wyoming, Durand escaped by taking a Deputy sheriff/Jailer's gun and forcing the officer to drive him into the countryside before he returned to his home. Durand shot and killed two police officersODMP memorials Baker and Lewis who came to his house to take him back to jail; then he armed himself and headed into the wilderness of the Beartooth Mountains. The prosecutor initially deputized 10 men to form a posse to find and bring Durand in for trial. Durand shot and killed two of the possemen who were searching for him. The manhunt grew to include the FBI, sharp shooters, the Wyoming National Guard with artillery from Fort Warren, civilians, and an airplane fitted with tear gas and dynamite bombs. During the manhunt, Durand eluded the pursuers for several days. He car-jacked a vehicle and drove it to Powell, where he attempted to rob a bank. He spent several minutes shooting at the windows and walls of the bank. Durand took several hostages, one of whom was killed by a citizen trying to shoot and take down Durand as they left the bank. After being shot by Tip Cox, Durand crawled back into the bank; there he killed himself with a shot to the neck. Representation in other media The 11-day manhunt was widely covered by the national press, with Durand being nicknamed \\"Tarzan of the Tetons\\". Inspired by the manhunt, the film Wyoming Outlaw was rapidly produced: the B movie starring John Wayne appeared in theaters 3 months after Durand's death. Durand was later portrayed by Peter Haskell in a Hollywood biopic, The Legend of Earl Durand (1974).

History  Shell started business in Nigeria in 1937 as Shell D‚ÄôArcy and was granted an exploration license. In 1956, Shell Nigeria discovered the first commercial oil field at Oloibiri in the Niger Delta and started oil exports in 1958. Retrieved 26 November 2012 Prior to the discovery of oil, Nigeria like many other African countries strongly relied on agricultural exports to other countries to support its economy. Many Nigerians thought the developers were looking for palm oil.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7840310.stm Retrieved 26 November 2012 Recent news In July 2013, Shell Nigeria awarded Kaztec engineering Limited a $84.5 million exploration and production contract for the Trans-Niger oil pipeline. On 25 March 2014, Shell Nigeria declared a force majeure on crude oil exports from its Forcados crude oil depot which stopped operations due to a leak in its underwater pipeline, a clause freeing the company from contractual obligations as a circumstance beyond its control happened. While it struggled repairing the pipeline, Royal Dutch Shell announced a force majeure on Nigerian crude oil exports. Uzere was the second place where oil was discovered. Olomoro was the third place, before oil discovery spread across most places in the Niger Delta region. Structure=Shell Petroleum Development Company= Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) is the largest fossil fuel company in Nigeria, which operates over of pipelines and flowlines, 87 flowstations, 8 natural gas plants and more than 1,000 producing wells. SPDC's role in the Shell Nigeria family is typically confined to the physical production and extraction of petroleum. It is an operator of the joint venture, which composed of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (55%), Shell (30%), Total S.A. (10%) and Eni (5%). Until relatively recently. It operated largely onshore on dry land or in the mangrove swamp. =Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company= Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO) was established in 1993. It operates two offshore licenses, including for the Bonga Field. =Shell Nigeria Gas= Shell Nigeria Gas (SNG) was established in 1998 for Shell Nigeria natural gas activities and natural gas transmission system operation. =Shell Nigeria on Oil Products= Shell Nigeria Oil Products (SNOP) - The principal activity of the company was the marketing and distribution of refined petroleum products, lubricants and industrial chemicals. =Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas= Nigeria LNG (NLNG) is a joint venture for liquefied natural gas production. Shell has a share of 25.6% in this company and is also its technical adviser. Other partners are Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (49%), Total (15%) and Eni (10.9%). Impact In the 1990s tensions arose between the native Ogoni people of the Niger Delta and Shell. The concerns of the locals were that very little of the money earned from oil on their land was getting to the people who live there, and the environmental damages caused by the recurring sabotage of pipelines operated by Shell.United Nations Economic and Social Council report Situation of human rights in Nigeria, submitted by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Mr. Soli Jehangir Sorabjee, pursuant to Commission resolution 1997/53 In 1993 the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) organized large protests against Shell and the government, often occupying the company production facilities. Shell withdrew its operations from the Ogoni areas. The Nigerian government raided their villages and arrested some of the protest leaders. Some of these arrested protesters, Ken Saro-Wiwa being the most prominent, were later executed, against widespread international opposition from the Commonwealth of Nations and human rights organisations. The ethnic unrest and conflicts of the late 1990s (such as those between the Ijaw, Urhobo and Itsekiri), coupled with a peak in the availability of small arms and other weapons, led increasingly to the militarization of the Delta. By this time, local and state officials had offered financial support to those paramilitary groups they believed would attempt to enforce their own political agenda. Conflagrations have been concentrated primarily in Delta and Rivers States. Shell maintained that it asked the Nigerian government for clemency towards those found guilty but its request was declined. A 2001 Greenpeace report mentioned two witnesses for whom the company and the Nigerian military \\"bribed\\" by promising money and jobs at the facility. Shell gave money to the military and was blamed for contaminating the Niger Delta with oil. The company denied these claims and implied that MOSOP was an extortionary movement that advocated violence and secession. In December 2003, Shell Nigeria acknowledged that the conflict in the Niger Delta makes it difficult to operate safely and with integrity and that \\"we sometimes feed conflict by the way we award contracts, gain access to land, and deal with community representatives\\", and that it intends to improve on its practices. In 2009, Shell offered to settle the Ken Saro-Wiwa case with US$15.5 million while denying any wrongdoings and calling the settlement a humanitarian gesture. According to the New York Times and the journalist Michael D. Goldhaber the settlement came days before the start of a trial in New York that was expected to reveal extensive details of Shell's and MOSOP's activities in the Niger Delta. Oil spills Individuals from villages surrounding oil production facilities occasionally drill holes into Shell Oil pipelines for the purposes of capturing oil and transporting it illegally out of Nigeria for monetary gain. This process, known as \\"oil bunkering\\", is estimated to cost Nigeria as much as 400,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Typically, when the oil theft operation is finished, the pipeline is left open, which results in an oil spill. In addition to the spills caused by 'oil bunkering', oils spills can also occur as a result of the quality of the equipment being used to extract and transport the oil. These spills are referred to as 'operational spills' and can be caused by corrosion, a lack of regular maintenance of the equipment, and overall underinvestment in the equipment being used. 18.7% of the spills reported by Shell since 2011 are labeled to be 'operational spills'. Oil spills can also occur as a result of natural hazards causing damage to pipelines.Steiner, Richard (November 2010). \\"Double Standard-Shell Practices in Nigeria compared with international standards to prevent and control pipeline and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill\\" (PDF). Friends of the Earth Netherlands. http://oasis- earth.com/Resources/Milieudefensie%20rapport%20Shell%20Double%20Standard%20L%2010-50-4435%20LR.pdf In 1970, there was an oil spill from a Shell pipeline caused primarily by corrosion and operational failure resulting in over 250 barrels of oil spilled. The resulting effects included the pollution of the surrounding air, water, and soil, as well as, a loss of the surrounding ecological and aquatic species. Health problems in the surrounding areas were also cited as an impact of the oil spill. In 1978, another spill from a Shell pipeline due to corrosion and operational failure was reported to have leaked 580,000 barrels of oil. The resulting impacts were air, water, and soil pollution in the area of the spill.Aroh, K.N. & Ubong, Ini & Chibuogwu, Eze & Harry, I.M. & Umo- Otong, J.C. & A.E., Gobo. (2010). Oil spill incidents and pipeline vandalization in Nigeria: Impact on public health and negation to attainment of Millennium development goal: The Ishiagu example. Disaster Prevention and Management. 19. 70-87. 10.1108/09653561011022153. In 2006, a team of experts in environmental assessments from Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and the United States were independently organized to conduct a Natural Resource Damage Assessment in the Niger Delta. They concluded that over the past fifty years, around nine million to thirteen million barrels of oil had been estimated to have spilled in the Niger Delta. Shell is responsible for around fifty percent of the oil production in Niger Delta. Between 1998 and 2009, Shell oil was responsible for 491, 627 barrels of oil spilled, averaging about 41,000 barrels per year. In 2011, Shell started publishing the reports it has been required to take every time an oil spill occurs. These reports, titled 'Joint Investigation Visit' or JIV, record when the spill began, where the spill took place, the cause of the spill, and the estimated amount of oil lost. JIV reports are important to not only keep track of the oil spills, but also to determine whether or not the surrounding communities will be able to receive forms of compensation for any damage on their homes, fisheries, or fields resulting from the oil spilled. Communities receive compensation only if the spill is not caused by sabotage or third party interference. This practice is based on Nigeria's 1990 Oil Pipelines Act that requires the company to compensate any person that is suffering from the damages of an oil spill, unless caused by a third party. The data from these reports have been published online since 2015 by the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA). Since 2011, 1,010 oil spills with an overall sum of 110,535 barrels, or 17.5 million liters, of oil have been reported as lost by Shell. Oil Spill Reporting Practices and Responses: Nigerian government regulations legally require companies to report a spill within twenty-four hours of the spill, then conduct a JIV report within the next twenty-four hours following. In addition, the repair and clean-up of the spill is also required to begin within the first twenty-four hours of when the spill was discovered. Shell's response time has been reported to rarely be within these regulations. In only 25.7% of the spills that have occurred since 2011, Shell has conducted JIV reports within the first twenty-hours of a spill being reported. Oftentimes, it has been reported that Shell and other oil companies do not begin to clean up the spills until after the reports are conducted delaying the response time even further. Shell does state that the pipelines are shut off in the event of a spill being reported, however, the oil that has already been spilled is still left in the environment. For example, 252 days passed before Shell visited the site of an oil spill that was reported in February 2016. Another case in May, 2015 took Shell 190 days to visit after a report had been made. Both spills were reportedly in areas that were easily accessible providing limited excuse for the companies delayed responses. On average, Shell took around 9.68 days to respond and conduct JIV reports for spills that occurred in water and around 5.35 days to respond and conduct JIV reports for spills that occurred on land. Underreporting on the amount of oil spilled during each incident can also be attributed to the high volatility of oil resulting in the evaporation of about 50% of the exposed oil within twenty-four to forty-eight hours of the initial spill. Amnesty International and Friends of the Earth International contested Shell's claims that up to 98% of all oil spills in Nigeria were due to sabotage. The two groups filed a complaint against the company in the OECD. Under Nigerian law, Shell has no liability when spills are classified as result of sabotage. Soon after, Shell representatives were heard by the Dutch Parliament and Shell revised its estimates from 98% to 70%. It was the second time the company did such a large revision to its oil spill statistics. A Dutch court ruled in 2013 that Shell is liable for the pollution in the Niger Delta. Shell faced their oil spill response practices in November 2014 during legal action that was taken in the United Kingdom. The spill that was contested was from the Trans-Niger Pipeline in 2008 where 1640 barrels of oil were reported by Shell and a second spill in 2009 where Shell reported 4000 barrels of oil were spilled. In court, the assessment was proven to be extremely under-estimated and Shell ended up committing to a compensation of 55 million pounds.  Court Cases Involving SPDC  Shell's oil extraction activities have been challenged in Court by various Nigerian communities. These communities sought to use the state and its judicial instruments to demand justice from the Shell corporation. Many communities have reported being disappointed by the legal process due to lengthy delays and the Court's perceived favoritism for the oil company. = _Ejama-Ebubu Court Case_ = In 1970, an oil spill occurred at one of Shell's oil extraction facilities located in the Ejama-Ebubu community. The exact cause for the oil spill is disputed with some claiming that the spill was caused by a bomb exploding during the Nigeria-Biafra civil war. Others reject this claim, and instead believe Shell's equipment is responsible for the spill. Although the cause for the spill is disputed, it is agreed that roughly two million barrels of crude oil was spilled, affecting 631 acres, or 255 hectares, of surrounding land. Additionally, it is known that the spilt oil caught fire and burned for weeks. Chief Isaac Osaro Agbara, Oneh-eh Eta Ejaman XI, Emere Nkunna I of Eleme explained the fire by stating, \\"One early morning, there was a blow-out. Everywhere was dark, but there was fire at the same time. People were running helter-skelter....The fire burnt sand into coal tar. Most of our people had to flee the community to neighbouring towns and villages.\\" In 2011, forty-one years after the spill, researchers have reported still being able to see oil when looking down into deep crevices and have found that eight centimeters of refined oil floats on groundwater in the region. The spilt oil is also said to have negative health consequences for members of the community, such as, causing respiratory problems because toxic gases are released. According to community members, SPDC had promised to clean up the affected land, but oil pollution remained. The long-lasting environmental impacts, the health consequences of the oil spill, and the unfulfilled promises to take action ultimately led the Ejama-Ebubu community to file a lawsuit against SPDC in 2001.  _Court Proceedings_  Thirty years after the spill, in 2001, the Ejama-Ebubu community filed a lawsuit against Shell at the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt. The community asked the Court to require that Shell provide remedies in three ways. First, the Ejama-Ebubu community sought N5.4 billion in special damages. These special damages include direct value lost due to the oil spill, such as the cost of renewable crops, loss of income, health problems, and desecration of shrines. Second, the community sought N10 billion in general damages caused by the oil spill. These general damages were claimed due to general inconveniences caused by the oil spill such as polluted underground water, acid rain, and other difficulties faced by the community, like deprivation of education. Lastly, the community asked that Shell de-pollute the affected area and restore the environment to its pre-polluted state. Although the lawsuit was initiated in 2001, a decision was not issued until 5 July 2010 by Justice Ibrahim Buba. The community's counsel, Emmanuel Asido Esq., explained that the case had been heard by two other judges before being presented to Justice Buba, resulting in a significant time delay. Justice Buba ruled in favor of the community, requiring Shell to pay N15.4 billion in damages and restore the Ejama-Ebubu land to its pre-polluted state. Justice Buba also decided that the Ejama-Ebubu community was granted a 25% interest charge on the N15.4 billion. Following this ruling, SPDC appealed the judgement in 2010 and asked that any payment be suspended until after the appeal process. The Court agreed that payment could be postponed, but required that SPDC's bank, First Bank Plc, become a guarantor of the funds payable to the Ejama-Ebubu community. The Bank agreed to become Shell's guarantor and volunteered to \\"guarantee to pay to the respondents [the community] the judgment sums only if the aforesaid appeal to the Court of Appeal fails and the appellants [SPDC] become liable in law to pay the judgment sums therein.\\" These judgement sums included the initial N15.4 billion as well as interest. In 2013, the Ejama-Ebubu community filed an objection to Shell's appeal because the oil company had not paid the correct filing fees. The Court upheld the community's objection and rejected SPDC's appeal. In response to this objection, SPDC appealed to the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In 2016, the Supreme Court of Nigeria overturned the Court of Appeal's decision to reject the appeal. Justice Ibrahim Muhammad of the Supreme Court decided that Shell was allowed to appeal the initial 2010 judgement and ruled that the Court of Appeals must hear the case. The following year, in 2017, the Court of Appeals at Port Harcourt ruled that SPDC needed to pay the Ejama-Ebubu community the damages plus interest. Accounting for the interest since the 2010 judgement of N15.4 billion, the oil company was now required to pay N122 billion. Since First Bank Plc's had accepted the responsibility as guarantor of payment if the appeal failed, the bank was then liable to pay N122 billion to the Ejama-Ebubu community. However, as of January 2019, Shell sought to continue the appeals process, and many people expect a continuation of the complex legal proceedings. = _Iwherekhan Court Case_ = In the Iwherekhan community, aring. According to Shell, it is common that when oil is brought to the Earth's surface, gas is produced as well. This gas is seen as an unwanted by-product and consequently, burned off in a process known as gas flaring. Many subsistence farm lands are located near the gas flaring station, and local community members have argued that the flaring activities contribute to environmental and health problems. In 2005, an Iwherekhan community member filed a lawsuit against SPDC in an attempt to shut down the gas flaring facility.  Court proceedings  Gas flare in the Niger Delta In July 2005, Jonah Gbemre, an Iwherekhan community member, filed a lawsuit against Shell to try to end gas flaring. Gbemre and the community argued that the extraction of oil and the technique of gas flaring results in a polluted environment and unhealthy living space. One activist in the region stated, \\"My community, Iwhrekan, is one out of the many of such host communities that have suffered from decades of gas flaring by IOCs [International Oil Company]. The million tons of carbon dioxide and methane released into the atmosphere every year, as a result of gas flaring, have obviously polluted the air we breathe in this part of the world.\\" On 14 November 2005, the Federal High Court in Nigeria ruled in favor of the Iwherekhan community and declared that gas flaring was illegal. Furthermore, the court determined that gas flaring constituted a violation of the Iwherekhan community members' right to life and dignity. SPDC appealed the ruling, and despite the court's order to stop gas flaring activities, it was reported that Shell continued to operate the gas flaring station in the Iwherekhan community. In response to SPDC's continued activities, on 16 December 2005, Gbemre and the Iwherekhan community filed contempt of court documents. However, SPDC argued that it was not in contempt of court since the oil company was still appealing the ruling. In April 2006, the Nigerian Supreme Court ordered that the oil company end all flaring by April 2007. However, as of 2015, gas flaring in the Iwherekhan community has continued, even though Shell announced that between 2002 and 2015 the volume of gas burned through gas flaring in Nigeria had been reduced by 85%. = _Bodo Community Settlement Case_ = In 2008, two oil spills occurred in the Bodo community. An investigation team was sent to determine the cause of the oil spill. Upon learning that operational failures of the pipelines caused the oil spills, Shell accepted responsibility. SPDC stated that the spills \\"were deeply regrettable operational accidents, and as in all cases of operational spills SPDC acknowledged responsibility to pay compensation as required by Nigerian law.\\" The oil company and the community were reportedly \\"in and out of\\" negotiations from 2009‚Äì2015, until finally an agreement suitable to both sides was crafted.  _Settlement Negotiations_  Two oil spills in the Bodo community negatively impacted the region's farmland and fisheries, harming the livelihood of the Bodo community members. SPDC initially responded to the oil spills in 2009 by offering food supplies to affected community members. This offer was rejected by Bodo chiefs, and SPDC then offered twice as much in food supplies. In 2011, members of the Bodo community brought claims against SPDC for environmental pollution. The environment pollution was significant for the Bodo community because the oil spilled into Bodo Creek, an important water supply for the community members who were mostly subsistence farmers and fishers. Following this lawsuit, Shell and the Bodo community more actively engaged in negotiation efforts, but the process was continuously interrupted by competing interests. The community argued that Shell was not offering enough compensation, while SPDC argued that the expectation of the community was too high and disproportionate to Nigerian standards. Finally, in 2015, Shell announced a ¬£55 million settlement agreement. The oil company stated \\"we have now reached a settlement agreeable to ourselves and the community.\\" References Shell first place of oil discovery in Nigeria is Iho-Dimeze Imo State around 1937 before they found a larger deposit in Oloibiri for export. Shell had there residential camp in Owerri called shell Camp about 10 km from Iho and more than 70 km from Oloibiri. Shell was in Owerri/Iho before Oloibiri and the camp still exists today.

A diode's I-V curve is nonlinear (it is well described by the Shockley diode law). This nonlinearity complicates calculations in circuits involving diodes so simpler models are often required. This article discusses the modelling of p-n junction diodes, but the techniques may be generalized to other solid state diodes. Large-signal modelling=Shockley diode model= The Shockley diode equation relates the diode current I of a p-n junction diode to the diode voltage V_D. This relationship is the diode I-V characteristic: ::I = I_S\\\\left(e^\\\\frac{V_D}{nV_\\\\text{T}} - 1\\\\right), where I_S is the saturation current or scale current of the diode (the magnitude of the current that flows for negative V_D in excess of a few V_\\\\text{T}, typically 10‚àí12A). The scale current is proportional to the cross- sectional area of the diode. Continuing with the symbols: V_\\\\text{T} is the thermal voltage (kT/q, about 26 mV at normal temperatures), and n is known as the diode ideality factor (for silicon diodes n is approximately 1 to 2). When V_D\\\\gg nV_\\\\text{T} the formula can be simplified to: ::I \\\\approx I_S \\\\cdot e^\\\\frac{V_D}{nV_\\\\text{T}}. This expression is, however, only an approximation of a more complex I-V characteristic. Its applicability is particularly limited in case of ultrashallow junctions, for which better analytical models exist.. Diode-resistor circuit example To illustrate the complications in using this law, consider the problem of finding the voltage across the diode in Figure 1. Figure 1: Diode circuit with resistive load. Because the current flowing through the diode is the same as the current throughout the entire circuit, we can lay down another equation. By Kirchhoff's laws, the current flowing in the circuit is ::I = \\\\frac{V_S - V_D}{R}. These two equations determine the diode current and the diode voltage. To solve these two equations, we could substitute the current I from the second equation into the first equation, and then try to rearrange the resulting equation to get V_D in terms of V_S. A difficulty with this method is that the diode law is nonlinear. Nonetheless, a formula expressing I directly in terms of V_S without involving V_D can be obtained using the Lambert W-function , which is the inverse function of f(w) = we^w, that is, w = W(f). This solution is discussed next. =Explicit solution= An explicit expression for the diode current can be obtained in terms of the Lambert W-function (also called the Omega function). A guide to these manipulations follows. A new variable w is introduced as ::w = \\\\frac{I_SR}{nV_\\\\text{T}} \\\\left(\\\\frac {I}{I_S} + 1\\\\right). Following the substitutions I/I_S = e^{V_D/nV_\\\\text{T}} - 1: ::w e^w = \\\\frac{I_SR}{nV_\\\\text{T}} e^\\\\frac{V_D}{nV_\\\\text{T}} e^{\\\\frac{I_SR}{nV_\\\\text{T}} \\\\left(\\\\frac{I}{I_S} + 1 \\\\right)} and V_D = V_S - IR: ::w e^w = \\\\frac{I_SR}{nV_\\\\text{T}} e^\\\\frac{V_S}{nV_\\\\text{T}} e^{\\\\frac{-IR}{nV_\\\\text{T}}} e^{\\\\frac{IR I_S}{nV_\\\\text{T} I_S}} e^\\\\frac{I_SR}{nV_\\\\text{T}} rearrangement of the diode law in terms of w becomes: ::w e^w =\\\\frac{I_SR}{nV_\\\\text{T}} e^\\\\frac{V_s + I_sR}{nV_\\\\text{T}}, which using the Lambert W-function becomes ::w = W\\\\left( \\\\frac{I_SR}{nV_\\\\text{T}} e^\\\\frac{V_s + I_sR}{nV_\\\\text{T}}\\\\right). With the approximations (valid for the most common values of the parameters) I_sR \\\\ll V_S and I/I_S \\\\gg 1, this solution becomes ::I \\\\approx \\\\frac{n V_\\\\text{T}}{R} W \\\\left(\\\\frac{I_S R}{n V_\\\\text{T}} e^\\\\frac{V_s}{n V_\\\\text{T}}\\\\right). Once the current is determined, the diode voltage can be found using either of the other equations. For large x, W(x) can be approximated by W(x) = \\\\ln x - \\\\ln\\\\ln x + o(1). For common physical parameters and resistances, \\\\frac{I_S R}{n V_\\\\text{T}} e^\\\\frac{V_s}{n V_\\\\text{T}} will be on the order of 1040.  Iterative solution  The diode voltage V_D can be found in terms of V_S for any particular set of values by an iterative method using a calculator or computer.. The diode law is rearranged by dividing by I_S, and adding 1. The diode law becomes ::e^\\\\frac{V_D}{nV_\\\\text{T}} = \\\\frac{I}{I_S} + 1. By taking natural logarithms of both sides the exponential is removed, and the equation becomes ::\\\\frac{V_D}{nV_\\\\text{T}} = \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{I}{I_S} + 1\\\\right). For any I, this equation determines V_D. However, I also must satisfy the Kirchhoff's law equation, given above. This expression is substituted for I to obtain ::\\\\frac{V_D}{nV_\\\\text{T}} = \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac {V_S - V_D}{R I_S} + 1\\\\right), or ::V_D = nV_\\\\text{T} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{V_S - V_D}{R I_S} + 1\\\\right). The voltage of the source V_S is a known given value, but V_D is on both sides of the equation, which forces an iterative solution: a starting value for V_D is guessed and put into the right side of the equation. Carrying out the various operations on the right side, we come up with a new value for V_D. This new value now is substituted on the right side, and so forth. If this iteration converges the values of V_D become closer and closer together as the process continues, and we can stop iteration when the accuracy is sufficient. Once V_D is found, I can be found from the Kirchhoff's law equation. Sometimes an iterative procedure depends critically on the first guess. In this example, almost any first guess will do, say V_D = 600\\\\,\\\\text{mV}. Sometimes an iterative procedure does not converge at all: in this problem an iteration based on the exponential function does not converge, and that is why the equations were rearranged to use a logarithm. Finding a convergent iterative formulation is an art, and every problem is different.  Graphical solution  Graphical determination of the operating point through the intersection of the diode characteristic with the resistive load line. Graphical analysis is a simple way to derive a numerical solution to the transcendental equations describing the diode. As with most graphical methods, it has the advantage of easy visualization. By plotting the I-V curves, it is possible to obtain an approximate solution to any arbitrary degree of accuracy. This process is the graphical equivalent of the two previous approaches, which are more amenable to computer implementation. This method plots the two current-voltage equations on a graph and the point of intersection of the two curves satisfies both equations, giving the value of the current flowing through the circuit and the voltage across the diode. The figure illustrates such method. =Piecewise linear model= A piecewise linear approximation of the diode characteristic. In practice, the graphical method is complicated and impractical for complex circuits. Another method of modelling a diode is called piecewise linear (PWL) modelling. In mathematics, this means taking a function and breaking it down into several linear segments. This method is used to approximate the diode characteristic curve as a series of linear segments. The real diode is modelled as 3 components in series: an ideal diode, a voltage source and a resistor. The figure shows a real diode I-V curve being approximated by a two-segment piecewise linear model. Typically the sloped line segment would be chosen tangent to the diode curve at the Q-point. Then the slope of this line is given by the reciprocal of the small- signal resistance of the diode at the Q-point.  Mathematically idealized diode  I-V characteristic of an ideal diode. Firstly, consider a mathematically idealized diode. In such an ideal diode, if the diode is reverse biased, the current flowing through it is zero. This ideal diode starts conducting at 0 V and for any positive voltage an infinite current flows and the diode acts like a short circuit. The I-V characteristics of an ideal diode are shown below:  Ideal diode in series with voltage source  Now consider the case when we add a voltage source in series with the diode in the form shown below: Ideal diode with a series voltage source. When forward biased, the ideal diode is simply a short circuit and when reverse biased, an open circuit. If the anode of the diode is connected to 0V, the voltage at the cathode will be at Vt and so the potential at the cathode will be greater than the potential at the anode and the diode will be reverse biased. In order to get the diode to conduct, the voltage at the anode will need to be taken to Vt. This circuit approximates the cut-in voltage present in real diodes. The combined I-V characteristic of this circuit is shown below: I-V characteristic of an ideal diode with a series voltage source. The Shockley diode model can be used to predict the approximate value of V_t. ::\\\\begin{align} &I; = I_S \\\\left( e^\\\\frac{V_D}{n \\\\cdot V_\\\\text{T}} - 1 \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Leftrightarrow {} &\\\\ln \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{I}{I_S} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{V_D}{n \\\\cdot V_\\\\text{T}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Leftrightarrow {} &V;_D = n \\\\cdot V_\\\\text{T} \\\\ln\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{I}{I_S}\\\\right) \\\\approx n \\\\cdot V_\\\\text{T} \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{I}{I_S} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Leftrightarrow {} &V;_D \\\\approx n \\\\cdot V_\\\\text{T} \\\\cdot \\\\ln{10} \\\\cdot \\\\log_{10}{\\\\left( \\\\frac{I}{I_S} \\\\right)} \\\\end{align} Using n = 1 and T = 25\\\\,\\\\text{¬∞C}: ::V_D \\\\approx 0.05916 \\\\cdot \\\\log_{10}{\\\\left( \\\\frac{I}{I_S} \\\\right)} Typical values of the saturation current at room temperature are: *I_S = 10^{-12} for silicon diodes; *I_S = 10^{-6} for germanium diodes. As the variation of V_D goes with the logarithm of the ratio \\\\frac{I}{I_S}, its value varies very little for a big variation of the ratio. The use of base 10 logarithms makes it easier to think in orders of magnitude. For a current of 1.0mA: *V_D \\\\approx 0.53\\\\,\\\\text{V} for silicon diodes (9 orders of magnitude); *V_D \\\\approx 0.18\\\\,\\\\text{V} for germanium diodes (3 orders of magnitude). For a current of 100mA: *V_D \\\\approx 0.65\\\\,\\\\text{V} for silicon diodes (11 orders of magnitude); *V_D \\\\approx 0.30\\\\,\\\\text{V} for germanium diodes (5 orders of magnitude). Values of 0.6 or 0.7 volts are commonly used for silicon diodes. Diode with voltage source and current- limiting resistor The last thing needed is a resistor to limit the current, as shown below: Ideal diode with a series voltage source and resistor. The I-V characteristic of the final circuit looks like this: I-V characteristic of an ideal diode with a series voltage source and resistor. The real diode now can be replaced with the combined ideal diode, voltage source and resistor and the circuit then is modelled using just linear elements. If the sloped-line segment is tangent to the real diode curve at the Q-point, this approximate circuit has the same small-signal circuit at the Q-point as the real diode.  Dual PWL-diodes or 3-Line PWL model  I-V characteristic of the standard PWL model (marked by red-triangles), as described above. Shown for reference is the standard Shockley-diode model (marked by blue-diamonds). The Shockley parameters are I = 1e - 12 A, V = 0.0258 V When more accuracy is desired in modelling the diode's turn-on characteristic, the model can be enhanced by doubling-up the standard PWL- model. This model uses two piecewise-linear diodes in parallel, as a way to model a single diode more accurately. PWL Diode model with 2 branches. The top branch has a lower forward-voltage and a higher resistance. This allows the diode to switch on more gradually, and in this regard more accurately models a real diode. The bottom branch has a higher forward voltage and a lower resistance, thus allowing high current at high voltage Plot of the I-V Characteristic of this model (marked by red-triangles), as compared to the standard Shockley-diode model (marked by blue-diamonds). The Shockley parameters are I = 1e - 12 A, V = 0.0258 V Small-signal modelling=Resistance= Using the Shockley equation, the small-signal diode resistance r_D of the diode can be derived about some operating point (Q-point) where the DC bias current is I_Q and the Q-point applied voltage is V_Q. To begin, the diode small-signal conductance g_D is found, that is, the change in current in the diode caused by a small change in voltage across the diode, divided by this voltage change, namely: ::g_D = \\\\left.\\\\frac{dI}{dV}\\\\right_Q = \\\\frac{I_s}{n \\\\cdot V_\\\\text{T}} e^\\\\frac{V_Q}{n \\\\cdot V_\\\\text{T}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{I_Q}{n \\\\cdot V_\\\\text{T}}. The latter approximation assumes that the bias current I_Q is large enough so that the factor of 1 in the parentheses of the Shockley diode equation can be ignored. This approximation is accurate even at rather small voltages, because the thermal voltage V_\\\\text{T} \\\\approx 25\\\\,\\\\text{mV} at 300K, so V_Q/V_\\\\text{T} tends to be large, meaning that the exponential is very large. Noting that the small-signal resistance r_D is the reciprocal of the small-signal conductance just found, the diode resistance is independent of the ac current, but depends on the dc current, and is given as ::r_D = \\\\frac{n \\\\cdot V_\\\\text{T}}{I_Q}. =Capacitance= The charge in the diode carrying current I_Q is known to be ::Q = I_Q\\\\tau_F + Q_J, where \\\\tau_F is the forward transit time of charge carriers: The first term in the charge is the charge in transit across the diode when the current I_Q flows. The second term is the charge stored in the junction itself when it is viewed as a simple capacitor; that is, as a pair of electrodes with opposite charges on them. It is the charge stored on the diode by virtue of simply having a voltage across it, regardless of any current it conducts. In a similar fashion as before, the diode capacitance is the change in diode charge with diode voltage: ::C_D = \\\\frac{dQ}{dV_Q} = \\\\frac{dI_Q}{dV_Q} \\\\tau_F + \\\\frac{dQ_J}{dV_Q} \\\\approx \\\\frac{I_Q}{V_\\\\text{T}} \\\\tau_F + C_J, where C_J = \\\\frac{dQ_J}{dV_Q} is the junction capacitance and the first term is called the diffusion capacitance, because it is related to the current diffusing through the junction.  Variation of forward voltage with temperature  The Shockley diode equation has an exponential of V_D/(kT/q), which would lead one to expect that the forward-voltage increases with temperature. In fact, this is generally not the case: as temperature rises, the saturation current I_S rises, and this effect dominates. So as the diode becomes hotter, the forward-voltage (for a given current) decreases. Here is some detailed experimental data, which shows this for a 1N4005 silicon diode. In fact, some silicon diodes are used as temperature sensors; for example, the CY7 series from OMEGA has a forward voltage of 1.02V in liquid nitrogen (77K), 0.54V at room temperature, and 0.29V at 100 ¬∞C.http://www.omega.com/Temperature/pdf/CY7.pdf datasheet In addition, there is a small change of the material parameter bandgap with temperature. For LEDs, this bandgap change also shifts their colour: they move towards the blue end of the spectrum when cooled. Since the diode forward-voltage drops as its temperature rises, this can lead to thermal runaway in bipolar-transistor circuits (base-emitter junction of a BJT acts as a diode), where a change in bias leads to an increase in power-dissipation, which in turn changes the bias even further.

He was an outspoken critic of the Iraq Interim Governing Council, which was the provisional government of Iraq from 2003 to 2004, established by the US-led multinational coalition occupying Iraq, following the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. He was assassinated on January 19, 2004. Academic career Abdul-Latif Ali al-Mayah taught the politics of the Arab region, and became the head of the Arab World Research and Studies Centre of Mustansiriya University. Students and colleagues said that he was an enthusiastic teacher and that he used his own money to buy computers for his classroom. Political positions Abdul-Latif Ali al-Mayah was for some time a low-level member of the Ba'ath Party. He voluntarily quit the party in 1991 due to dissatisfaction with it. He believed in the original Ba'ath ideal of Arab unity, but not in the way the Ba'ath Party was implementing this. While Saddam Hussein remained in power as president of Iraq, Al-Mayah called for elections. Because of this, he was imprisoned. He was released from prison, partly because one of his former students was one of the interrogators. Following the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, al-Mayah was against both the occupation and the previous dictatorship. According to Talal Nathan al-Zuhary, director of the Mustansiriya University library, al-Mayah believed that \\"one day he would be bumped off by the Mossad or the CIA\\" and that \\"More recently [following the invasion], he was more worried about the looters who came after the regime fell and stole so much.\\" Al-Mayah became well known as a human rights and pro- democracy campaigner. On the evening of January 18, 2004, on the television channel al-Jazeera, he had criticised what he called the corruption of the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC), appointed by the US authorities, and demanded universal elections as soon as possible, as had earlier done during the presidency of Saddam Hussein. He is quoted as saying, \\"I can endure any Iraqi government, but the feeling of being under occupation is terrible for me.\\" Since US authorities were planning a caucus system for choosing a new government rather than representative democracy by all Iraqi adult citizens, al-Mayah's public declaration directly opposed United States policy in Iraq. Circumstances of death On the morning of January 19, 2004, al-Mayah left his house at 8am and starting driving his car, with another professor, Sarhan Abbas, in the passenger seat. Due to the road shape and traffic, he slowed down the car, and passed an outdoor shish kebab restaurant, El Banouk (The Bank), which was just about to open for the day. About a hundred metres further on, he slowed the car again because of a large pothole. A group of seven or eight men with their faces concealed by red keffiyehs (headscarves) appeared from a side road. Al-Mayah thought they were carjackers and was ready to hand them the keys. The attackers then shot al-Mayah more than 20 times. Al-Mayah's bodyguard, Mohamed Sahib, did not have a gun since he was still waiting for a gun licence from US authorities. Sahib stated, \\"They shouted for the car to stop... I remember one person fired directly at al-Mayah inside the car and I think another group also fired from the other side. He was shot three times in his head just as he was opening the car door to get out. He fell dead on to the ground.\\" Speculation regarding death A senior commander at the headquarters of the Iraqi police, who insisted on remaining anonymous in fear for his safety, told the New Statesman reporter, \\"You can look no further than the Governing Council (IGC). There are political parties in this city who are systematically killing people. They are politicians that are backed by the Americans and who arrived to Iraq from exile with a list of their enemies. I've seen these lists. They are killing people one by one.\\" Al- Mayah's brother told the New Statesman that his brother had received many emails advising him to \\"be less outspoken in his criticism of the IGC.\\" At least one came from an IGC member. Al-Mayah's brother stated, \\"He never told me the name of this man, only that he was a dual national, someone who had come back from exile after the Americans invaded. He told me the man never actually threatened him. It was a sort of warning that it would be safer if he left the country. He was determined not to be swayed.\\" At al-Mayah's funeral procession, a banner alleged that \\"America and the Zionists\\" were responsible for his death. One of al-Mayah's students, Salam Rais, supported the claim that a systematic campaign to kill Iraqi academics existed, stating \\"His assassination is part of a plan in this country, targeting any intellectual in this country, any free voice.\\" Posthumous award Al-Mayah was posthumously awarded the Train Foundation's Civil Courage Prize, which recognizes \\"extraordinary heroes of conscience\\".

The citadel has been inscribed on the World Heritage List since 21 June 2014. The earliest evidence for occupation of the citadel mound dates to the 5th millennium BC, and possibly earlier. It appears for the first time in historical sources in the Ebla tablets around 2,300 BC, and gained particular importance during the Neo-Assyrian period. During the Sassanian period and the Abbasid Caliphate, Erbil was an important centre for Christianity. After the Mongols captured the citadel in 1258, the importance of Erbil declined. During the 20th century, the urban structure was significantly modified, as a result of which a number of houses and public buildings were destroyed. In 2007, the High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR) was established to oversee the restoration of the citadel. In the same year, all inhabitants, except one family, were evicted from the citadel as part of a large restoration project. Since then, archaeological research and restoration works have been carried out at and around the tell by various international teams and in cooperation with local specialists. The government plans to have 50 families live in the citadel once it is renovated. The buildings on top of the tell stretch over a roughly oval area of occupying . The only religious structure that currently survives is the Mulla Afandi Mosque. The mound rises between from the surrounding plain. When it was fully occupied, the citadel was divided in three districts or mahallas: from east to west the Serai, the Takya and the Topkhana. The Serai was occupied by notable families; the Takya district was named after the homes of dervishes, which are called takyas; and the Topkhana district housed craftsmen and farmers. History=Prehistory= The site of the citadel may have been occupied as early as the Neolithic period, as pottery fragments possibly dating to that period have been found on the slopes of the mound. Clear evidence for occupation comes from the Chalcolithic period, with sherds resembling pottery of the Ubaid and Uruk periods in the Jazira and southeastern Turkey, respectively. Given this evidence for early occupation, the citadel has been called the oldest continuously occupied site in the world. =Earliest historical records= Erbil appears for the first time in literary sources around 2300 BC in the archives of Ebla. According to Giovanni Pettinato, it is mentioned in two tablets as Irbilum.Martha A. Morrison, David I. Owen, eds, General Studies and Excavations at Nuzi 9/1; Volume 2 In Honor of Ernest R. Lacheman. Eisenbrauns, 1981 The city was first largely under Sumerian domination from c. 3000 BC, until the rise of the Akkadian Empire (2335‚Äì2154 BC) which united all of the Akkadian Semites and Sumerians of Mesopotamia under one rule. Later, Erridupizir, king of Gutium, captured the city in 2200 BC.Timeline ErbilCitadel.orq At the end of the 3rd millennium BC, Erbil is mentioned in historical records of the Ur III period as Urbilum. King Shulgi destroyed Urbilum in his 43rd regnal year, and during the reign of his successor Amar-Sin, Urbilum was incorporated into the Ur III state. In the 18th century BC, Erbil appears in a list of cities that were conquered by Shamshi-Adad of Upper Mesopotamia and Dadusha of Eshnunna during their campaign against the land of Qabra. Shamshi-Adad installed garrisons in all the cities of the land of Urbil. During the 2nd millennium BC, Erbil was incorporated into Assyria. Erbil served as a point of departure for military campaigns toward the east. =From the Neo-Assyrian period to the Sassanids= Erbil was an important city during the Neo-Assyrian period. The city took part in the great revolt against Shamshi-Adad V that broke out over the succession of Shalmaneser III. During the Neo-Assyrian period, the name of the city was written as Arbi-Ilu, meaning 'Four Gods'. Erbil was an important religious centre that was compared with cities such as Babylon and Assur. Its goddess Ishtar of Erbil was one of the principal deities of Assyria, often named together with Ishtar of Nineveh. Her sanctuary was repaired by the kings Shalmaneser I, Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal. Inscriptions from Assurbanipal record oracular dreams inspired by Ishtar of Erbil. Assurbanipal probably held court in Erbil during part of his reign and received there envoys from Rusa II of Urartu after the defeat of the Elamite ruler Teumman. After the end of the Assyrian Empire, Erbil was first controlled by the Medes and then incorporated into the Achaemenid Empire before it became part of the empire of Alexander the Great after the Battle of Gaugamela, which was fought near Erbil in 331 BC. Subsequently, after the partition of Alexander the Great Empire by his generals (known as Diadochoi), the city was called Arabella or Arbela and it was part of the Hellenistic Seleucid Kingdom. After the 1st c. BCE, the Roman and Parthian Empire fought over control of Erbil, or Arbira as it was known in that period. After the 1st c. AD, Arbela became an important Christian centre. During the Sassanid period, Erbil was the seat of a satrap (governor). In 340 AD, Christians in Erbil were persecuted and in 358, the governor became a martyr after he converted to Christianity. A Nestorian school was founded in Erbil by the School of Nisibis in c. 521. During this period, Erbil was also the site of a Zoroastrian fire temple. =Muslim conquest until the Ottomans= alt=Painting showing an army encampment with horses, soldiers and tents in front of a walled city with towers and a gate guarded by soldiers Erbil was conquered by the Muslims in the 7th century. It remained an important Christian centre until the 9th century, when the bishop of Erbil moved his seat to Mosul. In the Middle of 10th century Erbil came under the rule of Hadhabani Kurds until 1063 it was taken over by Seljuks. From the first half of the 12th century until 1233, Erbil was the seat of the Begteginids, a Turcoman dynasty that rose to prominence under the reign of Zengi, the atabeg of Mosul.in 1183 Zain ad-Din Yusuf ruler of Erbil shifted his side to the Ayyubid Sultanate. In 1190 when Zain ad-Din Yusuf Died His older brother Muzaffar al-Din G√∂kb√∂ri who was previously governor of Edessa became the new governor of Erbil, who created a lower town around the city on the citadel mound and founded hospitals and madrasahs. G√∂kburi died in 1233 without an heir and control of Erbil shifted to the Abbasid Caliph al- Mustansir after he had besieged the city. When the Mongols invaded the Near East in the 13th century, they attacked Erbil for the first time in 1237. They plundered the lower town but had to retreat before an approaching caliphal army and had to put off the capture of the citadel. After the fall of Baghdad to H√ºleg√º and the Mongols in 1258, they returned to Erbil and were able to capture the citadel after a siege lasting six months. H√ºleg√º then appointed a Christian governor to the town and there was an influx of Jacobite Christians, who were allowed to build a church. As time passed, persecutions of Christians, Jews and Buddhists throughout the Ilkhanate began in earnest in 1295 under O√Ørat amir Nauruz.Grousset, p. 379 This manifested early on in the reign of the Ilkhan Ghazan. In 1297, after Ghazan had felt strong enough to overcome Nauruz' influence, he put a stop to the persecutions. During the reign of the Ilkhan √ñljeit√º some of the Christian inhabitants retreated to the citadel to escape persecution. In the spring of 1310, the Malek (governor) of the region attempted to seize it from them with the help of the Kurds. Despite Mar Yahballaha's best efforts to avert the impending doom, the citadel was at last taken by Ilkhanate troops on 1 July 1310, and all the defenders were massacred, including all the Christian inhabitants of the lower town.Grousset, p. 383 After Battle of Chaldiran in 1514 Erbil came under Soran emirate A semi independent Emirate under the Ottomans In the 18th century Baban Emirate took the city but it was retaken by Soran ruler Mir Muhammed Kor in 1822 The Soran emirate continued ruling over erbil until it was taken by the Ottomans in 1851. Erbil became a part of the Musul Vilayet in Ottoman Empire for until World War I, when the Ottomans and their Kurdish and Turcoman allies were defeated by the British Empire., the town had approximately 3,200 inhabitants, including a sizeable Jewish minority. =Modern period= During the 20th century, the citadel witnessed significant urban and social changes. A high steel water tank was erected on the citadel in 1924, providing the inhabitants with purified water, but also causing water damage to the foundations of the buildings due to increased water seepage. The number of inhabitants gradually declined over the 20th century as the city at the foot of the citadel grew and wealthier inhabitants moved to larger, modern houses with gardens. In 1960, over 60 houses, a mosque and a school were demolished to make way for a straight road connecting the southern gate with the northern gate. Some reconstruction works were carried in 1979 on the citadel's southern gate and the hammam. In 2007, the remaining 840 families were evicted from the citadel as part of a large project to restore and preserve the historic character of the citadel. These families were offered financial compensation. One family was allowed to continue living on the citadel to ensure that there would be no break in the possible 8,000 years of continuous habitation of the site, and the government plans to have 50 families live in the citadel once it is renovated. In 2004, the Kurdish Textile Museum opened its doors in a renovated mansion in the southeast quarter of the citadel. Architecture and layout alt=Photograph The citadel is situated on a large tell ‚Äì or settlement mound ‚Äì of roughly oval shape that is between high. The area on top of the mound measures and is large. Natural soil has been found at a depth of below the present surface of the mound. The angle of the citadel mound's slopes is c. 45¬∞. Three ramps, located on the northern, eastern and southern slopes of the mound, lead up to gates in the outer ring of houses. The southern gate was the oldest and was rebuilt at least once, in 1860, and demolished in 1960. The current gate house was constructed in 1979. The eastern gate is called the Harem Gate and was used by women. It seems unclear when the northern gate was opened. One source claims that it was opened in 1924, while another observes that there were only two gates in 1944 ‚Äì the southern and eastern gates. ornaments on the traditional house walls in the citadel of Erbil, Iraq. During the early 20th century, there were three mosques, two schools, two takyas and a hammam on the citadel. The citadel also housed a synagogue until 1957. The only religious structure that currently survives is the Mulla Afandi Mosque, which was rebuilt on the location of an earlier 19th-century mosque. The hammam was built in 1775 by Qassim Agha Abdullah. It went out of service during the 1970s and was renovated in 1979, although many original architectural details were lost. The door way of a traditional house in the Citadel of Erbil, Iraq. When it was still occupied, the citadel was divided in three districts or mahallas: from east to west the Serai, the Takya and the Topkhana. The Serai was occupied by notable families; the Takya district was named after the homes of dervishes, which are called takyas; and the Topkhana district housed craftsmen and farmers. A 1920 inventory showed that at that time the citadel was divided into 506 house plots. Since then the number of houses and inhabitants has gradually declined. For example, in 1984 4,466 people lived in 375 houses, whereas a 1995 census showed that the citadel had only 1,631 inhabitants living in 247 houses. Until the opening-up of the main north‚Äìsouth thoroughfare, the streets on the citadel mound radiated outward from the southern gate like the branches of a tree. Streets were between wide and ranged in length from for major alleyways to for cul-de-sacs. The interior of a Traditional House in the Citadel of Erbil, Iraq. The perimeter wall of the citadel is not a continuous fortification wall, but consists of the fa√ßades of approximately 100 houses that have been built against each other. Because they have been built on or near the steep slope of the citadel mound, many of these fa√ßades were strengthened by buttresses to prevent their collapse or subsidence. There were circa 30 city-palaces; most of them located along the perimeter of the citadel. The oldest surviving house that can be securely dated through an inscription was built in 1893. The oldest houses can be found on the southeastern side of the mound, whereas houses on the northern perimeter date to the 1930s‚Äì1940s. Before the introduction of modern building techniques, most houses on the citadel were built around a courtyard. A raised arcade overlooking the courtyard, a flat roof and a bent-access entrance to prevent views of the courtyard and the interior of the house were characteristic elements of the houses on the citadel. Research and restoration alt=Photograph of houses In 2006 and 2007, a team from the University of West Bohemia, together with Salahaddin University in Arbil, carried out an extensive survey and evaluation of the entire citadel. As part of this project, geodetic measurements of the citadel were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create a map and digital 3D model of the citadel mound and the houses on top of it. Geophysical prospection was carried out in some areas of the citadel to detect traces of older architecture buried under the present houses. Archaeological investigations included an archaeological survey on the western slope of the citadel mound, and the excavation of a small test trench in the eastern part of the citadel. A Neo-Assyrian chamber tomb was found at the foot of the citadel mound during construction activities in 2009. It was subsequently excavated by the local Antiquities Service and archaeologists from the German Archaeological Institute (DAI). The tomb was plundered in antiquity but still contained pottery dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. The cooperation between the Antiquities Service and the DAI was continued later that year with a further investigation of the tomb and with a small excavation nearby and geophysical survey of the surrounding area, in which also students from Salahaddin University participated. These investigations revealed the presence of architecture probably dating to the Neo-Assyrian period, as well as more burials belonging to subsequent centuries. Entrance of Erbil citadel (Front view) In 2007, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) established the High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR) to preserve and restore the citadel with the help of UNESCO. Among other things, the HCECR advocates the establishment of a zone extending up to from the citadel in which building height should be restricted to approximately . This would ensure the visual dominance of the citadel over its surroundings. On 2 April 2019, NASA has described the historic citadel as possibly the oldest continuously occupied human settlement on Earth. =UNESCO World Heritage status= On 8 January 2010, the HCECR and the Iraqi State Board for Antiquities and Heritage (SBAH) submitted the Citadel of Erbil to the Iraqi Tentative List of sites that are considered for nomination as World Heritage Site. The submission states that \\"The Citadel is today one of the most dramatic and visually exciting cultural sites not only in the Middle East but also in the world.\\" Two further agreements between the HCECR and UNESCO were signed in March 2010, and it was disclosed that Arbil Governorate will finance the restoration project with US$13 million. The first restoration works were carried out in June 2010. The Citadel was inscribed on the World Heritage List on 21 June 2014. In January 2017, UNESCO indicated that the site could be removed from the list due to the slow progress being made in the restoration program. =Gallery= Some photos of the Citadel of Erbil during the restoration work, 2014.

Her first retrospective was put on when she was nearly 90 years old, \\"Never Late for Heaven: The Art of Gwen Knight,\\" at the Tacoma Art Museum in 2003. Her teachers in the arts included the sculptor Augusta Savage (who obtained support for her from the Works Progress Administration) and Jacob Lawrence, whom she married in 1941 and remained married to until his death in 2000.Cotter, Holland.

During the course of her career, she received many awards, including the National Honor Award, and two honorary doctorate degrees, from University of Minnesota and Seattle University. With her husband, Knight founded the Jacob and Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence Foundation in 2000, initially to support the early careers of professional artists. When Lawrence died, Knight disbanded the original foundation and changed her will so that most of the couple's assets went to support children's programs. Today the Foundation's activities are devoted to the maintenance of a website that had been developed in 2000.The Jacob and Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence Foundation Website's Searchable Archive The U.S. copyright representative for the Jacob and Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.Most frequently requested artists list of the Artists Rights Society Early life and education Knight was born in 1913 in Barbados, West Indies. At the age of seven, her mother entrusted her to close friends with whom she immigrated to the United States. She and her foster family first lived in St. Louis, Missouri. At age 13, she and her foster family moved to Harlem (New York City), where she graduated from Wadleigh High School in 1930. From 1931 to 1933 she attended Howard University, studying fine arts. The depression caused financial hardship, causing Knight to drop out before receiving her degree. Knight subsequently returned to New York City, where she was employed by the Works Projects Administration as an assistant to the muralist, Charles Alston. She continued to study art at the Harlem Community Art Center, where she was mentored by Augusta Savage. Through Savage, she met or was exposed to the work of Langston Hughes, Ralph Ellison, Romare Bearden, Claude McKay and other artists, poets, and writers of the Harlem Renaissance. In 1934 Knight joined a Works Progress Administration (WPA) mural project, where she met her future husband and fellow painter, Jacob Lawrence. The couple were married in 1941. In 1946, Josef Albers invited them to teach at Black Mountain College, which had begun integrating and incorporating African-American culture into its curriculum a few years prior to the couple's time there. During the 1950s, the couple worked and lived in New York. Then in 1964, they traveled to Nigeria. In 1971, Lawrence accepted a position at University of Washington‚Äôs School of Art. The couple moved to Seattle, where they lived as active members of the artist community and of the city itself. Knight even procured support from The National Links, Inc. for her first one-woman show, which was developed in 1976. This exhibit sparked a greater desire for her work and the acquiring of her pieces by national museums.http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/knight- bio.htm Work Knight's work focused on narrative paintings depicting the life, culture, and history of African Americans, through still life, portraits, and urban scenes. The majority of her career produced oil portraits of friends, figure studies of dancers, and watercolor and gouache landscapes. However, her work began to shift in the 1990s incorporating lyrical depictions of animals through etchings and monoprints. Her inspiration came from spontaneous responses to her surroundings, as well as African dance, sculpture, and theater. Exhibitions Knight did not begin exhibiting her work publicly until the 1970s. Knight had several major solo exhibitions: Seattle Art Museum (1976), Virginia Lacy Jones Gallery, Atlanta University (1988), Francine Seders Gallery in Seattle (1994), Never Late for Heaven: The Art of Gwen Knight, at the Tacoma Art Museum (2003) and at DC Moore Gallery, New York in 2003. Her work was included in several group exhibitions, including the 1967 show, Portrayal of the Negroes in American Painting at the Forum Gallery. Awards and honors In 1993, Knight received the Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award. She was honored with the Caucus Centennial Medallion, from the Black Caucus. In 1984 she received the Centennial Award of Merit from Arizona State University, and in 1994, she received the Pioneer Award, Twelfth Annual Artists' Salute to Black History Month.

Neapope (Na-pope meaning \\"Broth\\" in the Sauk language) was a spiritual leader of the Sauk tribe and advisor to Black Hawk during the Black Hawk War. Biography A prominent chieftain of the Sauk prior to the Black Hawk War, Neapope was first consulted by Black Hawk in 1820 on whether to declare war against neighboring American settlers or to move his supporters, including Neapope and Sauk chieftain Keokuk, from Illinois and into Iowa. Although Neapope advised a confederacy, including the Winnebago and Potowatomi in particular, to help defend Black Hawk's tribe, no chieftains would agree to an alliance. Neapope also travelled to Malden, Ontario in an attempt to gain British support from General Gaines, however Gaines declined stating the American settlers had a legal right to the land and advised Black Hawk to remain at peace with local settlers. Returning from Canada, Neapope stopped at the camp of the Winnebago Prophet, Wabokieshiek, where he was assured of support before returning to Black Hawk. As fighting began, Neapope served throughout the war as one of Black Hawk's leading allies, most notably during the Battle of Wisconsin Heights (near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin) where he successfully held off local militia while allied forces were able to escape across the Wisconsin River. Near the end of the war, Neapope was captured by Black Hawk rival Keokuk, who cooperated with American settlers but was imprisoned with Black Hawk until their release several weeks later by President Andrew Jackson and eventually rejoined the Sauks in Iowa.

All geometric objects are wrapped in bounding volumes that form the leaf nodes of the tree. These nodes are then grouped as small sets and enclosed within larger bounding volumes. These, in turn, are also grouped and enclosed within other larger bounding volumes in a recursive fashion, eventually resulting in a tree structure with a single bounding volume at the top of the tree. Bounding volume hierarchies are used to support several operations on sets of geometric objects efficiently, such as in collision detection and ray tracing. Although wrapping objects in bounding volumes and performing collision tests on them before testing the object geometry itself simplifies the tests and can result in significant performance improvements, the same number of pairwise tests between bounding volumes are still being performed. By arranging the bounding volumes into a bounding volume hierarchy, the time complexity (the number of tests performed) can be reduced to logarithmic in the number of objects. With such a hierarchy in place, during collision testing, children volumes do not have to be examined if their parent volumes are not intersected. BVH design issues The choice of bounding volume is determined by a trade-off between two objectives. On the one hand, we would like to use bounding volumes that have a very simple shape. Thus, we need only a few bytes to store them, and intersection tests and distance computations are simple and fast. On the other hand, we would like to have bounding volumes that fit the corresponding data objects very tightly. One of the most commonly used bounding volumes is an axis-aligned minimum bounding box. The axis-aligned minimum bounding box for a given set of data objects is easy to compute, needs only few bytes of storage, and robust intersection tests are easy to implement and extremely fast. There are several desired properties for a BVH that should be taken into consideration when designing one for a specific application:Christer Ericson, Real-Time Collision Detection, Page 236‚Äì237 * The nodes contained in any given sub-tree should be near each other. The lower down the tree, the nearer the nodes should be to each other. * Each node in the BVH should be of minimum volume. * The sum of all bounding volumes should be minimal. * Greater attention should be paid to nodes near the root of the BVH. Pruning a node near the root of the tree removes more objects from further consideration. * The volume of overlap of sibling nodes should be minimal. * The BVH should be balanced with respect to both its node structure and its content. Balancing allows as much of the BVH as possible to be pruned whenever a branch is not traversed into. In terms of the structure of BVH, it has to be decided what degree (the number of children) and height to use in the tree representing the BVH. A tree of a low degree will be of greater height. That increases root-to-leaf traversal time. On the other hand, less work has to be expended at each visited node to check its children for overlap. The opposite holds for a high-degree tree: although the tree will be of smaller height, more work is spent at each node. In practice, binary trees (degree = 2) are by far the most common. One of the main reasons is that binary trees are easier to build. Construction There are three primary categories of tree construction methods: top-down, bottom- up, and insertion methods. Top-down methods proceed by partitioning the input set into two (or more) subsets, bounding them in the chosen bounding volume, then keep partitioning (and bounding) recursively until each subset consists of only a single primitive (leaf nodes are reached). Top-down methods are easy to implement, fast to construct and by far the most popular, but do not result in the best possible trees in general. Bottom-up methods start with the input set as the leaves of the tree and then group two (or more) of them to form a new (internal) node, proceed in the same manner until everything has been grouped under a single node (the root of the tree). Bottom-up methods are more difficult to implement, but likely to produce better trees in general. Some recent studies (e.g. Y. Gu, Y. He, K. Fatahalian and G Blelloch. Efficient BVH Construction via Approximate Agglomerative Clustering. HPG 2013.) indicate that in low-dimensional space, the construction speed can be largely improved (which matches or outperforms the top-down approaches) by sorting objects using space-filling curve and applying approximate clustering based on this sequential order. Both top-down and bottom-up methods are considered off-line methods as they both require all primitives to be available before construction starts. Insertion methods build the tree by inserting one object at a time, starting from an empty tree. The insertion location should be chosen that causes the tree to grow as little as possible according to a cost metric. Insertion methods are considered on-line methods since they do not require all primitives to be available before construction starts and thus allow updates to be performed at runtime. Usage BVHs are often used in ray tracing to eliminate potential intersection candidates within a scene by omitting geometric objects located in bounding volumes which are not intersected by the current ray.Johannes G√ºnther, Stefan Popov, Hans-Peter Seidel and Philipp Slusallek, Realtime Ray Tracing on GPU with BVH-based Packet Traversal Additionally, as common performance optimization, when only closest intersection of the ray is of interest, as the ray tracing traversal algorithm is descending nodes, and multiple child nodes are intersecting the ray, traversal algorithm will consider the closer volume first, and if it finds intersection there, which is definitively closer than any possible intersection in second (or other) volume (i.e. volumes are non-overlapping), it can safely ignore the second volume. Similar optimizations during BVH traversal can be employed when descending into child volumes of the second volume, to restrict further search space and thus reduce traversal time. Additionally, many specialized methods were developed for BVHs, especially ones based on AABB (axis-aligned bounding boxes), such as parallel building, SIMD accelerated traversal, good split heuristics (SAH - surface-area heuristic is often used in ray tracing), wide trees (4-ary and 16-ary trees provide some performance benefits, both in build and query performance for practical scenes), and quick structure update (in real time applications objects might be moving or deforming spatially relatively slowly or be still, and same BVH can be updated to be still valid without doing a full rebuild from scratch). BVHs also naturally support inserting and removing objects without full rebuild, but with resulting BVH having usually worse query performance compared to full rebuild. To solve these problems (as well as quick structure update being sub-optimal), the new BVH could be built asynchronously in parallel or synchronously, after sufficient change is detected (leaf overlap is big, number of insertions and removals crossed the threshold, and other more refined heuristics). BVHs can also be combined with scene graph methods, and geometry instancing, to reduce memory usage, improve structure update and full rebuild performance, as well as guide better object or primitive splitting.

Nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, it is about east of Modesto on the Stanislaus River. The Willms Ranch, a California Landmark near the town, was one of many filming locations for the television series Bonanza and Little House on the Prairie.\\"Bonanza: Scenery of the Ponderosa - Willms Ranch\\" \\"Bonanza: Scenery of the Ponderosa - Williams Ranch\\" Common confusion with adjoining Willims ranch which is west of the county line. Williams ranch was established in 1852 and was almost entirely within Calaveras County. Willims ranch is in Stanislaus County and shares a common boundary with then the Williams ranch. It is home to the Knights Ferry Bridge, the longest covered bridge west of the Mississippi at in length. Today, it is home to a K-8 Elementary School, and a museum about the history of the town and also about local wildlife. The town's ruins include a mill and a jail. History When gold was discovered in California in 1849, Dr. William Knight rediscovered a place which he and John C. Fremont had previously found to be a favorable river crossing, and established a ferry boat there. Soon, the ferry boat prospered and Knight and Captain Vantine built a hotel and trading post near the crossing. On November 9, 1849, Knight was killed in a gunfight and was buried in an unmarked grave. Knight's family believed he was stabbed to death in his bed and was buried near the gate in the yard of John Dent's house, which was Dr. Knight's place at the time. The Dents immediately took possession of Bill Knight's property at Knight's Ferry following the murder. Lewis Dent House Knights Ferry was also the county seat in 1862, as it replaced La Grange. It was soon succeeded by the new, prosperous railroad boomtown of Modesto in 1871. After Knight's death, Vantine operated the ferry alone until he formed another collaboration with John and Lewis Dent, brothers to President Ulysses S. Grant‚Äôs wife, Julia Grant. In 1852, Vantine sold his properties in the area to the Dents and moved elsewhere. A new townsite under the name of \\"Dentville\\" was laid out by John Dent. The inhabitants continued to call the town \\"Knights Ferry\\" and \\"Knights Crossing\\". In 1852, a toll bridge replaced the ferry. It was destroyed by the Great Flood of 1862. The new covered bridge was built at a higher level than the previous one, and it still stands today. The bridge was used for car traffic until it was closed to prevent damage in 1985. In addition to being the longest covered bridge west of the Mississippi River, the bridge is one of the nation's finest examples of a Howe truss covered bridge. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2012.

This recreation area includes a \\"put in\\" location for Class I-II rafting trips on the Stanislaus River. Rafting most often occurs April through October. Water in the lower Stanislaus is discharged from the base of New Melones Dam, resulting in clear and cold water even in the warmest months of summer. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains recreational facilities along the Stanislaus River. Park Rangers caution rafters to exercise caution and use life vests, as the rapids below Knights Ferry can be challenging when the river is high. The ZIP Code is 95361.

It is distinct from Carney's triad. Approximately 7% of all cardiac myxomas are associated with Carney complex. Presentation The spotty skin pigmentation and lentigines occur most commonly on the face, especially on the lips, eyelids, conjunctiva and oral mucosa. Cardiac myxomas may lead to embolic strokes and heart failure and may present with fever, joint pain, shortness of breath, diastolic rumble and tumor plop. Myxomas may also occur outside the heart, usually in the skin and breast. Endocrine tumors may manifest as disorders such as Cushing syndrome. The most common endocrine gland manifestation is an ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome due to primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD). The LAMB acronym refers to lentigines, atrial myxomas, and blue nevi. NAME refers to nevi, atrial myxoma, myxoid neurofibromas, and ephelides. Testicular cancer, particularly Sertoli cell type, is associated with Carney syndrome.Campbell Walsh urology, 10th edition, page 1693 Thyroid and pancreas cancer may also occur. Although J Aidan Carney also described Carney's triad it is entirely different. Pathophysiology Carney complex is most commonly caused by mutations in the PRKAR1A gene on chromosome 17 (17q23-q24) which may function as a tumor- suppressor gene. The encoded protein is a type 1A regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. Inactivating germline mutations of this gene are found in 70% of people with Carney complex. Less commonly, the molecular pathogenesis of Carney complex is a variety of genetic changes at chromosome 2 (2p16). Both types of Carney complex are autosomal dominant. Despite dissimilar genetics, there appears to be no phenotypic difference between PRKAR1A and chromosome 2p16 mutations. DiagnosisTreatment Cardiac myxomas can be difficult to manage surgically because of recurrence within the heart, often far away from the site of the initial tumor. History In 1914 an American neurosurgeon, Harvey Cushing, reported on a patient with a pituitary tumour on whom he had operated.Tsay CJ, Stratakis CA, Faucz FR, London E, Stathopoulou C, Allgauer M, Quezado M, Dagradi T, Spencer DD, Lodish M (2017) Harvey Cushing treated the first known patient with Carney complex. J Endocr Soc 1(10):1312-1321. doi: 10.1210/js.2017-00283 The post mortem findings as reported were consistent with Carney complex, though at the time this condition had yet to be described. In 2017 archived tissue from the operation in Cushing's report was subjected to DNA sequencing, revealing an Arg74His (arginine to histidine: guanine (G)-> adenosine (A) transition in the second codon position of the 74th codon in the protein) mutation in the PRKAR1A gene, confirming a diagnosis of Carney complex. Therefore, Cushing's paper appears to be the first report of this complex.

Owned by California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo, the station is operated by students from its on- campus studio located in the Graphic Arts building. In addition to its FM broadcast, KCPR streams its programming online 24 hours a day and has established a growing social media audience. KCPR is known for launching the careers of several entertainers and public figures, including musician Weird Al Yankovic, comedian Eric Schwartz, and news reporter David Kerley. History KCPR debuted in August 1968, making its first broadcast with a small two-watt transmitter. According to station lore, the first words spoken on-air were, \\"Is this the damn switch?\\" However, an archived version of KCPR's website from 2000 holds the station's first words to be, \\"How the hell do you turn this thing on?\\" Cal Poly professor and former KCPR disc jockey Jim Cushing describes the station's musical philosophy as \\"to provide people with a blend of music that they will not find on any other station, to remind people that the musical culture belongs to them\\".

He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round of the 2006 NFL Draft after playing college football at Ohio State. In 2009, Holmes was named MVP of Super Bowl XLIII as the Steelers beat the Arizona Cardinals. In 2010, Holmes was traded to the New York Jets in exchange for the Jets' fifth round pick. Holmes also played a season for the Chicago Bears. Early years Holmes attended Glades Central High School in Belle Glade, Florida. He was a letterman in football, basketball, and track. In football, he helped lead his team to two state titles and a 12-1 record as a senior. In basketball, he helped lead his team to a state runner-up finish as a senior. In track, his team won the state title during his junior year, and he was the member of a 4x400 meter relay team that won two state titles, and recorded a personal-best time of 49.85 seconds in the 400 meters. Santonio graduated from Glades Central High School in 2002 with a 3.4 GPA. College career Holmes attended Ohio State University where he was red shirted when the Buckeyes won the 2002 National Championship. Holmes caught 140 passes for 2,295 yards and 25 touchdowns, while gaining 3,123 all-purpose yards. His 140 career receptions and 3,496 yards were ranked the fifth highest totals in school history at the time. His 25 touchdown catches ranked him 3rd in the NCAA. Professional career=2006 NFL CombinePittsburgh Steelers=2006 Holmes left college a year early and was taken in the first round (25th overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft by the defending Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers. The 25th pick overall, he was the first receiver since Plaxico Burress taken in the first round by the Steelers. The Steelers traded up with the New York Giants from 31st to draft Holmes. Holmes, who wore number 4 at Ohio State (a number that isn't issued to wide receivers in the NFL), was issued number 10, previously worn in Pittsburgh by former kicker Roy Gerela and quarterback Kordell Stewart. Early on in the Steelers' disappointing 2006 season, Holmes was criticized for his poor performance on special teams as a returner, a role in which he fumbled frequently. However, Holmes had better success as a receiver, displaying his athleticism and skill in several of the Steelers' games. He earned Week 6 Diet Pepsi Rookie of the Week honors for his performance October 15 against the Kansas City Chiefs, totaling 58 yards receiving and 13 yards rushing. Santonio Holmes with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2006. Late in the season, Holmes replaced Cedrick Wilson in the starting lineup and finished the 2006 regular season with 49 receptions for 824 yards and 2 touchdowns. His best play of the season was also the last, when, in overtime of the Steelers' final game of the season against the Cincinnati Bengals, Holmes caught a pass from Ben Roethlisberger on a slant route and ran for a 67-yard touchdown to secure a win for the Steelers. He also returned a punt 65 yards for a touchdown on December 17 against the Carolina Panthers. 2007 Holmes was named the Steelers' starting split end coming into training camp. He enjoyed a breakout season in 2007 as he led the Steelers in receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, and emerged as one of the better known deep threats in the NFL. In Week 1 of the season against the Cleveland Browns, Holmes caught a 40-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger as they went on to defeat the Browns 34‚Äì7. Week 4 in a loss against the Arizona Cardinals, he enjoyed one of the best games in his young pro career as he finished the game with 6 receptions, 128 yards, and 2 touchdown catches. In Week 9, he enjoyed another two touchdown game against the Baltimore Ravens, both touchdowns came in the first half. He finished the game with 4 catches, 110 yards, and two touchdowns. In Week 16, Santonio Holmes amassed the most yards receiving in a game in his career, as he finished the game with 133 yards receiving against the St. Louis Rams. He finished the year with 942 yards receiving and 8 touchdown catches. He led the league in yards per catch. In his first career playoff game, a 31‚Äì29 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, he finished the game with 3 catches, 49 yards, and a touchdown. 2008 Despite returning no punts throughout the 2007 season, Holmes explored returning again for the 2008 season. During the offseason, Holmes had set a goal to play in all 16 games throughout the season, increasing his weight by 11 pounds through workouts in the offseason. Holmes began the season with 2 receptions for 19 yards in a win against the Houston Texans. In the following 10-6 win over the Cleveland Browns, Holmes totaled 94 yards on 5 receptions and had a carry for 10 yards. In the following loss to the Eagles, he recorded 3 receptions for 32 yards. Holmes saw his first score the following week in an overtime win against the Baltimore Ravens, finishing with 61 yards on 3 receptions for a touchdown. Following a bye week, Holmes totaled 89 yards on 5 receptions in the win against the Cincinnati Bengals. However, Holmes was benched following being arrested for possession of marijuana. Holmes was benched by coach Tomlin twice. He was forced to miss the following loss to the New York Giants, but was activated again for the Monday Night game against the Washington Redskins. Statistically, Holmes' production decreased when compared to his 2007 stats. He declined in receptions, receiving yards, and receiving average. However, Holmes' still contributed big plays throughout the season, especially during the game versus the Cowboys where he caught a long pass that ignited a struggling Steelers offense. In Super Bowl XLIII, Holmes secured the Steelers' NFL-record 6th Super Bowl win after catching a 6-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger with 35 seconds left in regulation. Holmes caught nine passes for 131 yards and a touchdown, including four receptions for 73 yards on their final game-winning drive. He was named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the sixth wide receiver to win the award, and also was the third Pittsburgh receiver to win the award, following Lynn Swann in Super Bowl X and Hines Ward in Super Bowl XL. 2009 Statistically, 2009 was the best season of his career. He had 79 catches, 1,248 receiving yards, and five touchdowns and became Pittsburgh's first receiving target in which was surprisingly his last year with the team. He was traded during the offseason due to his brushes with the law (see section Legal trouble). =New York Jets=2010 On April 11, 2010, Holmes was traded to the New York Jets in exchange for a fifth-round pick in the 2010 NFL Draft (the Steelers eventually traded the pick to the Arizona Cardinals in exchange for a sixth round pick, which they used to draft Antonio Brown, and reacquiring Bryant McFadden; the Cardinals used the pick on quarterback John Skelton). Shortly before the trade, the NFL announced that Holmes would be suspended for the first four games of the season due to a violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy. The trade came after Holmes' incident in a nightclub, coinciding with Ben Roethlisberger's own legal troubles, and the Steelers wanting to set an example for its other players. Had Holmes not been traded, the Steelers would have released him. After serving a four-game suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy, Holmes returned to practice on October 6, 2010. Although Holmes was forbidden to participate in practices with his teammates and he was suspended from playing for the Jets during their regular season contests, he was still eligible to attend team meetings and work out daily at the team's facilities. On November 14, 2010, with 22 seconds to go in overtime against the Cleveland Browns, Holmes caught a pass on the Browns 31-yard line and carried it in for a touchdown, giving the Jets a 26-20 victory. The very next week, on November 21, 2010, Holmes caught a game-winning touchdown from Mark Sanchez with 10 seconds left and the Jets went on to beat the Houston Texans 30‚Äì27. During the 2010-2011 postseason, the Jets made it to the AFC Championship Game before losing to Holmes' former team, the Pittsburgh Steelers. 2011 Holmes re-signed with the Jets during the offseason, shortly before the start of 2011 season agreeing to a 5-year deal. He was named one of the team captains, along with starting quarterback Mark Sanchez, before the season began. In the 4th quarter of the final game of the 2011 season against the Miami Dolphins, Holmes appeared to get into an argument with Jets offensive tackle Wayne Hunter while the team was huddling. As a result of the argument, Holmes was benched for the remainder of the game, and the Jets ended up losing the game, which resulted in the Jets missing the postseason for the first time in 3 years. His leadership qualities and credibility as a captain have since been questioned. Holmes finished the season with just 51 catches, the second lowest total of his career, along with only 654 receiving yards, by far the lowest total of his career. He also finished with a career low 12.8 yards per reception average. He did, however, tally a new career high in touchdown receptions with 8. 2012 Holmes was lost for the remainder of the 2012 season after sustaining a severe Lisfranc foot injury in Week 4 against the San Francisco 49ers, and was eventually placed on injured reserve. 2013 The Jets approached Holmes in the offseason to restructure his contract; Holmes obliged. Holmes' rehabilitation from foot surgery continued into training camp and the preseason. Holmes was removed from the active/physically unable to perform list and moved to the active roster on August 23, 2013. Holmes was released by the Jets on March 10, 2014. =Chicago Bears=2014 Holmes signed a one-year contract with the Chicago Bears on August 16, 2014. Holmes was waived on November 11, 2014, having played just nine games and totaling only 8 receptions for 67 yards. =Retirement= After being out of the league for nearly three years, Holmes returned to the Steelers on October 10, 2017, for a retirement ceremony, saying: \\"It's an honor to retire as a member of the Steelers and leave a legacy everyone will remember.\\" =Career statistics= { class=wikitable style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! rowspan=2Season !! rowspan=2Team !! colspan=2Games !! colspan=5Receiving !! colspan=5Rushing !! colspan=2Fumbles - !

Charges were subsequently dropped after Holmes paid a fine. Holmes was arrested for a second time on June 18, 2006 for domestic violence and assault in Columbus, Ohio. On July 7, 2006, Holmes appeared in Franklin County Court in Columbus, Ohio for both a pre-trial hearing regarding the domestic case and a hearing regarding the traffic ticket. He pleaded no contest to the traffic ticket and agreed to pay a fine. While Lashae Boone, the mother of Holmes' daughter and the victim in the assault case, requested that the domestic violence and assault charges be dropped, the prosecutor refused. Boone and their daughter accompanied Holmes to court. The charges were later dropped. On October 23, 2008, Holmes was arrested in Pittsburgh and cited by officers for possession of marijuana. He released an apology after missing a game, stating that he wished to \\"focus all of [his] efforts on helping our team win on the field and achieve its ultimate goal.\\" On March 24, 2010, Anshonae Mills filed a lawsuit against Holmes over a March 7 incident in which she alleges Holmes threw a glass at her in an Orlando nightclub, resulting in a cut above her eye. Initially, Mills did not pursue charges, claiming Holmes and the police intimidated her into it, but the case has been reopened. Subsequently, after a Twitter comment criticizing the nightclub incident, Holmes told the follower to \\"kill urself.\\" He later Tweeted it was time to \\"wake n bake,\\" a reference to marijuana. Holmes alleges his account was hacked and it was not him making the comments. On April 29, 2010, according to a report filed by authorities at Pittsburgh International Airport, a flight attendant told police that Holmes wouldn't turn off his iPod when requested and asked that officers speak to him. Holmes got off the Colgan Air flight and spoke to the officers, who reminded him to comply with regulations, but did not charge the wide receiver with anything. Holmes later talked to Jets head coach Rex Ryan about the incident.

Tazumal is an architectural complex within the larger area of the ancient Mesoamerican city of Chalchuapa, in western El Salvador. The Tazumal group is located in the southern portion of the Chalchuapa archaeological zone.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 193. Archaeologist Stanley Boggs excavated and restored the Tazumal complex during the 1940s and 1950s.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 193. Kato et al 2006, p. 211. Archaeological investigations indicate that Tazumal was inhabited from the Classic period through to the Postclassic and that the site had links as far afield as central Mexico, the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula and lower Central America. Metal artifacts from the complex date to the 8th century AD and are among the earliest metal artifacts reported from Mesoamerica. Location Tazumal is situated within the municipality of Chalchuapa in the department of Santa Ana,Kato et al 2006, p. 211. within the R√≠o Paz drainage basin. The ruins are at an altitude of above mean sea level.Ito and Shibata 2007, p. 872. It is about from the contemporary Maya city of Kaminaljuyu. Tazumal is southwest of the small Late Classic site of Alumulunga.Cobos 1994, 1998, pp. 28-29. History Chalchuapa was inhabited since the Preclassic period, when massive construction activity took place. Around the boundary between the end of the Late Preclassic and the start of the Early Classic, construction at Tazumal was interrupted by the eruption of the Ilopango volcano, some to the east of the city. This eruption caused a hiatus in construction activity at Tazumal that may have lasted several generations. Activity resumed during the Early to Middle Classic (c. AD 250-650) although the city never fully recovered to its Preclassic levels of activity. The Tazumal complex came closest to matching the enormous structures of the Preclassic period.Sharer 1974, p. 172. The principal structures of the Tazumal group date to the Classic period (c. AD 250-900) of Mesoamerican chronology. By the Late Classic (c. AD 600-900) Tazumal was an important ceremonial complex. Construction activity is evident from the Early Classic through to the Middle Classic (c. AD 400-600).Cobos 1994, 1998, pp. 63-64. At this time Tazumal had important links with the Maya city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala, which acted to extend the influence of the powerful central Mexican city of Teotihuacan into the Pacific coastal areas of Guatemala and El Salvador.Adams 1996, p. 226. During the Late Classic Tazumal had links with Cop√°n in Honduras, as evidenced by architecture, sculpture and ceramics at Tazumal.Sheets 2000, p. 485. The ceramic sequence at Tazumal continues uninterrupted from the Classic period through to approximately AD 1200.Cobos 1994, 1998, pp. 75, 80. A number of Early Classic features indicate links with Chichen Itza, in the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula, or with Tula in central Mexico. The population of Tazumal coexisted with the Nahua-speaking Pipils from the Classic through to the Early Postclassic until at least AD 1200.Cobos 1994, 1998, pp. 81-82. Sharer 1974, p. 173. The Pipil influence may have been due to trade with neighbouring Pipil populations rather than a direct Pipil presence, judging by the level of evidence. After 1200, Tazumal was largely abandoned, with occupation shifting westwards towards the centre of what is now the modern town of Chalchuapa. Chalchuapa was still occupied at the time of the Spanish conquest, at which time its inhabitants were Poqomam Maya. The Pokomam are believed to have been relatively late settlers in Chalchuapa, postdating the Pipil influence that lasted until 1200. Between 1942 and 1944 Stanley Boggs excavated and restored structures B1-1 and B1-2.Cobos 1994, 1998, p. 25. This restoration included coating the structures with modern cement, which Boggs judged to be sufficiently similar to their original appearance as to justify its use. Boggs' final report was not made generally available and no further archaeological investigations were carried out until the early 21st century. In 1947 Tazumal was declared a National Historic Monument. Until 2001, the Salvadoran 100 col√≥n note carried an illustration of the ruins of Tazumal. In 2004, the side of Structure B1-2 collapsed and the Salvadoran Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y el Arte (CONCULTURA - National Council for Culture and Art) initiated operations to excavate and stabilise the ruins. During the first decade of the 21st century, two simultaneous archaeological projects were initiated, the investigation of Structure B1-2 by CONCULTURA and the Proyecto Arqueol√≥gico de El Salvador (PAES) by the Japanese University of Nagoya.Ito and Shibata 2007, p. 868. Site description All the buildings in the Tazumal complex face west. Tazumal is believed to possess a Mesoamerican ballcourt;Parsons 1991, p. 202. this is based upon the external appearance of two unexcavated mounds that are situated in the northwestern portion of the site, within a 20th-century cemetery. One of the mounds is badly damaged.Kato et al 2006, p. 212. Green obsidian artefacts found at Tazumal indicate links with central Mexico.Cobos 1994, 1998, p. 75. =Structure B1-1= View towards the main pyramid B1-1, with Structure B1-2 on the right hand side Structure B1-1 is the principal structure in the Tazumal group and dominates the complex. The pyramid underwent various phases of construction through the Classic and Early Postclassic periods. Structure B1-1 was built upon a basal platform, called the Great Platform by Boggs, that measures (east-west by north-south).Kato et al 2006, p. 220. The pyramid was surveyed in 2003-2004\\\\. A long platform runs north-south along the western facade of the pyramid and a platform of similar length runs east-west along the north side of the structure. These two side platforms were originally built as separate structures but were later incorporated into the Great Platform; it is presumed by investigators that the temple was radially symmetrical and that further platforms existed on the east and south sides. The remains of a platform measuring were found in roughly the correct position for such a platform on the east side. A test pit sunk into the presumed area of the southern platform uncovered an offering containing a cylindrical ceramic vessel with a polychrome bowl placed upon it like a lid. Within the vessel were two larger pieces of jade and 50 smaller jade fragments, a fragment of seashell and a fragment of snail shell, various pieces of animal bone, mica and traces of red pigment. The offering was covered with a slab of stone. The cylindrical vessel was decorated with two panels, each containing a personage wearing a headdress and performing autosacrifice.Ito and Shibata 2007, p. 880. Structure B1-1 is believed to have developed from a central temple and platforms on each side in the cardinal directions, with the west platforms serving as the main approach. As the complex developed, the space between the platforms was filled to form the Great Platform, the earliest version of which measured . The main pyramid B1-1 was then built upon the Great Platform, behind the western platform and covering the original central temple. The Great Platform was remodelled at least three times before it reached its final dimensions.Kato et al 2006, p. 221. Temple of the Columns The western platform of Structure B1-1 supports a superstructure, which has been called the Temple of the Columns.Kato et al 2006, p. 218. Kelly 1996, p. 303. Because of the westward orientation of all the structures at Tazumal, the Temple of the Columns standing on the west side of the main pyramid may have served as its main facade. This structure had square columns and two identically sized chambers, separated by a space with two columns. The northern chamber had an entrance on the east side, with a possible additional entrance on the south side. =Structure B1-2= Structure B1-2 dates to the Late Classic. It is located to the southwest of the main pyramid B1-1.Kato et al 2006, p. 213. It is a west-facing pyramid with three stepped levels standing upon a low basal platform. It was built using the talud-tablero style of architecture;Cobos 1994, 1998, p. 74. the pyramid measures and stands approximately tall. In October 2004 the south side of the pyramid collapsed; this is believed to have been caused by a combination of damage caused by the roots of nearby trees and water damage. The restoration of the pyramid with cement in the 1950s had converted the structure into a water trap, while cedar roots had penetrated the building to a height of causing significant cracking. Structure B1-2 underwent four phases of construction.Kato et al 2006, pp. 214-217. The earliest phase had a total height of ; the lowest level measured high while the middle and upper levels both measured high.Kato et al 2006, p. 214. This first phase was completely covered by the second phase of construction, executed in three sub-phases (labelled 2A, 2B and 2C).Kato et al 2006, pp. 215-216. This was built in a style very similar to that of the first phase, first with the extension of the lower two levels while still using the earlier top level; a new third level was added later, completely covering the previous version. The lower two levels were first raised to high; the middle level was then raised an additional and the upper level was increased to high.Kato et al 2006, p. 215. Finally, a fourth level was added to the pyramid, bringing its total height to . During the third phase of construction, the structure was increased from four to five levels. The levels varied in height between them, measuring , , , and respectively.Kato et al 2006, p. 216. The fourth and final construction phase was badly damaged by the collapse of the structure in 2004.Kato et al 2006, p. 217. =Other structures= Structure B1-3 and Structure B1-4 are the two structures that comprise the ballcourt.Ito and Shibata 2008, p. 461. Test pits excavated during the first decade of the 21st century found the mortar floor of an I-shaped ballcourt.Kato et al 2006, p. 218. Ito and Shibata 2008, p. 461. Structure B1-8 is a circular platform dating to the Late Classic period. Sculpture Sculpture in the Tazumal site museum representing the god Xipe Totec Sculpture at the site dates as far back as the Preclassic period.Parsons 1991, p. 209. Two Terminal Classic to Early Postclassic chacmool sculptures were recovered from Tazumal, as well as a jaguar effigy sculpture and an anthropomorphic sculpture depicting the central Mexican deity Xipe Totec.Cobos 1994, 1998, pp. 74-75, 80. These artefacts are stylistically similar to artefacts from central Mexico and the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula.Cobos 1994, 1998, p. 80. One of the crude chacmool sculptures is housed in the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a in San Salvador; the other is in private ownership.Sharer 1974, p. 173. Metal artifacts Three gold ornaments have been excavated from Tazumal. They were created using the lost wax method and have been tentatively dated to the 8th century AD; their presence indicates contacts with lower Central America.Sheets 2000, p. 433. These, together with some contemporary metal artefacts from Cop√°n, are among the earliest reported metal artefacts from Mesoamerica.Sorenson 1954, p. 64. These items were recovered from a Late Classic tomb and at least one item was a traded artefact from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.Bray 1971, p. 38. Burials According to anecdotal evidence from workers who excavated the area of the presumed eastern platform of B1-1, many burials were found in that area. However, these were not mentioned by Boggs in any of his excavation reports. Burial 1 was found interred under the ledge joining the first and second levels of Pyramid B1-2. The burial consisted of a lower jaw and the remains of several other bones, accompanied by ceramic fragments and some obsidian artefacts. The dispersed remains indicate that Burial 1 was a secondary burial, possibly that of a human sacrifice associated with the dedication of the final phase of the pyramid. The teeth indicate that the remains were those of a young adult; the associated ceramics date the burial to the Terminal Classic or Early Postclassic.Kato et al 2006, pp. 217-218. Burial 2 was found under the western facade of Structure B1-2. Its dating is uncertain but it is believed to be associated with the final phase of construction and contemporaneous with Burial 1. The burial consisted of many bone fragments, including skull, longbones, ribs, jaw and vertebrae. The teeth indicate that the remains were those of a child. The remains were accompanied by ceramic pieces and some ashes. The ashes were subjected to radiocarbon dating, which indicated a date in the Late Classic to Early Postclassic, between AD 770 and 1000.Kato et al 2006, p. 218.

The extension runs from Lougheed Town Centre in Burnaby to Lafarge Lake‚ÄìDouglas in Coquitlam and included six new SkyTrain stations and an upgraded existing station (Lougheed Town Centre) on the Millennium Line. It began operations on December 2, 2016. Since the extension opened, the Millennium Line has operated between VCC‚ÄìClark and Lafarge Lake‚ÄìDouglas. In 2012, the extension was expected to serve 70,000 passengers per day by 2021. History Burquitlam station in Coquitlam A rapid transit extension to Coquitlam was intended to be phase II of the new Millennium Line that was completed in 2002. As the costs of the project rose, however, plans to extend the line into Coquitlam were halted, though not before a third incomplete platform on the westbound side of the Lougheed Town Centre station was built, with a spur of tracks for the extension. After completion of the Millennium Line, TransLink undertook several studies regarding the fate of the extension, considering a variety of possible options, including a diesel multiple unit- based railway, a streetcar line, a new SkyTrain line, and an express bus service. In September 2002, the 97 B-Line express bus service was launched. In 2004, it was decided that a streetcar line was the best option, as it would better blend in with the neighbourhood, cost less, better fit ridership patterns, and not compete with customers from the existing West Coast Express. Detailed design began in October 2006, when the TransLink Board approved the Evergreen Light Rail Transit (LRT) project definition phase. Despite a series of public consultations held during this period, in a community update issued May 2007, TransLink summarized the state of the project as follows: This statement prompted local news agencies to assume TransLink had shelved the project. TransLink responded by issuing a subsequent statement on July 19: \\"The Light Rail Transit system for the Northeast Sector is the number one rapid transit priority for TransLink\\", TransLink Chair Malcolm Brodie said. \\"We have defined the project, and now we are waiting for funding to be confirmed from senior levels of government.\\" Evergreen Line logo used during the planning stage On February 1, 2008, the provincial government and TransLink unveiled a revised business case for the Evergreen extension, preferring the Advanced Light Rapid Transit (ALRT) used by SkyTrain over the light rail technology that had been proposed. The expected completion date was pushed back from 2011 to 2014. On April 18, 2008, the Transport Ministry and TransLink announced that of the two routes proposed in the business case, the North West route was selected after consultation with the various municipalities. On August 5, 2008, the provincial government and TransLink agreed on Evergreen Line delivery. On May 4, 2009, the Ministry of Transportation released a Project Description Report for the Evergreen Line. The report provided more information about the scope and characteristics of the proposed line and detailed the project's environmental and socio-economic requirements. On September 3, 2009, the release of the report on TransLink's 2010 ten-year plan by Martin Crilly, the Regional Transportation Commissioner appointed by the provincial government, indicated that rapid transit expansion, which included the Evergreen Line, was highly unlikely without a predictable source of operational funding. Although he stopped short of offering his opinion on the project, he agreed nonetheless with TransLink that upgrades to the existing system should be prioritized before the construction of the Evergreen Line. Later that month, the second project update was released by the Evergreen Line Project. The update stated that contractor selection would begin in early to mid-2010, environmental assessment would be completed in 2010, and construction would proceed in late 2010. The update also announced open houses for the environmental assessment process for September 2009 and open houses for preliminary design in October and November 2009. It did not make reference to the funding issues that remained unresolved. On October 26, 2009, the TransLink Mayors' Council voted against the increased funding necessary to pursue the Evergreen Line, instead voting for keeping existing services as they are. However, on October 28, 2009, Premier Gordon Campbell stated that the project would continue even though it had been voted down. On October 7, 2011, the Mayors' Council approved the \\"Moving Forward\\" 2012 Supplemental Plan to fund various transportation projects in the Metro Vancouver region, including the Evergreen Line. Funding would be provided in part by a two-cents-per-litre increase in the Metro Vancouver fuel tax that was to be implemented in April 2012, with further funding from new sources that had yet to be determined. Of the projected $1.4 billion cost for the Evergreen Line, TransLink would provide $400 million, the provincial government would contribute $583 million, and the federal government would contribute $417 million. Transportation Minister Blair Lekstrom announced that construction was expected to begin in mid-2012, soon after a winning bid for construction had been chosen from three shortlisted builders. On January 25, 2012, the provincial government announced that pre- construction work would proceed on the line, including the removal of some buildings and the construction of underground utility tunnels. In May 2012, preliminary construction began, including the removal of some buildings and the construction of underground utility tunnels in certain areas of Port Moody and Coquitlam. At the same time, the province also awarded contracts to widen sections of North Road that were to be affected by construction of the line in the middle of the year. On July 19, 2012, the Government of Canada, the City of Coquitlam, and Coquitlam Centre Mall reached an agreement to add Lincoln station to the Evergreen Line project, with the federal government contributing $7 million to the public‚Äìprivate partnership. On October 4, 2012, SNC-Lavalin was chosen as the primary contractor to construct the Evergreen Line. On December 3, 2012, the provincial government and TransLink signed a contract with Bombardier Transportation to supply 28 SkyTrain cars. On December 8, 2012, the final early works contract for the Evergreen Line was awarded and was to be completed by March 2013. The statement also promised that the project was still on track for completion in 2016. On February 5, 2013, Thales Canada announced that it had been awarded a contract by Partnerships BC to install the company's SelTrac communications-based train control (CBTC). Construction along North Road in Burnaby and Coquitlam, in March 2014 On March 23, 2013, the final names of the Evergreen Line stations were announced. It was also announced that construction of the Evergreen Line guideway would start in the Burquitlam area of Coquitlam in mid-2013 and continue south to Lougheed Town Centre station. The stations were to be built in the following order: *Inlet Centre station, including utility work; *Moody Centre station, including utility work and relocation of the railway in the area; * Lincoln station, Burquitlam station, and Lougheed Town Centre station (beginning in mid-2013); and * Coquitlam Central station and Lafarge Lake‚ÄìDouglas station (beginning in late 2013). In October 2014, the elevated guideway section between Lougheed Town Centre station to the South Tunnel Portal was completed. The launching truss was transported to Coquitlam Central station, where crews continued to build the elevated guideway north to Lafarge Lake‚ÄìDouglas station. On February 13, 2015, the provincial government announced that the opening of the line would be delayed until late 2016, due to a slower-than-expected tunnel boring process. Any costs associated with the delay would come at no cost to the taxpayers and would instead be covered by the contractor. In June 2015, the project management team announced that they would begin testing trains between Lougheed station and Burquitlam station in July 2015. In the week of July 6, 2015, testing began. On November 27, 2015, the provincial government announced that the opening of the line would be further delayed until early 2017. As of April 2016, the project was 85% complete, including trackwork in elevated and at-grade guideways, guideway construction, tunnel boring, tunnel base, station buildings, and testing between Lougheed and Burquitlam station. On September 8, 2016, it was announced that the line would be opening before Christmas 2016 but that a concrete date had yet to be set. On October 22, 2016, Expo Line and Millennium Line route changes took effect to accommodate the Evergreen Extension. The changes, announced on September 19, 2016, were implemented ahead of the Evergreen Extension opening to familiarize riders with the new operating pattern. On November 7, 2016, TransLink announced that the extension would open on December 2, 2016.  Project funding Funding for the project was provided from four major groups: * Government of British Columbia: $586 million * Government of Canada: $424 million * TransLink: $400 million * City of Coquitlam and Coquitlam Centre: $21 million Route description A train running on the Evergreen Extension The July 2012 project update gave the following description of the alignment: From the line's opening until June 24, 2018, trains ran in the direction of left-hand traffic instead of the standard right-hand traffic between Burquitlam and Lougheed Town Centre, and used two switches just south of Burquitlam station to return to normal travelling direction. Normal right-hand running between those two stations commenced on June 25, 2018, in order to reduce delays. Design The May 2009 Project Description Report and September 2009 Project Update provided previously unconfirmed details about the Evergreen Line, including the following: * Travel time from Coquitlam City Centre to Lougheed Town Centre would be 15 minutes. * Service would be every three minutes during peak hours. * Operating hours would be approximately 20 hours per day on weekdays, and less on weekends. * The line would provide direct connections, without transfers, to what [was then] the Millennium Line. * Projected ridership was 70,000 per day in 2021. * Peak hour system capacity would be 10,400 passengers in 2021. * Operations would be integrated with the existing SkyTrain facility near Edmonds station on the Expo Line. The LRT-based plan foresaw eleven stations. As part of the decision to use ALRT technology, four planned stations were cut: Cameron, Buller, Lansdowne, and Coquitlam Civic Centre. =Stations= Six new stations were confirmed for the opening of the Evergreen Extension: * Burquitlam station, on the east side of Clarke Road near Burquitlam Plaza * Moody Centre station, at the Port Moody transit exchange site * Inlet Centre station, north of Barnet Highway, on the north side of the CPR tracks * Coquitlam Central station, at the Coquitlam transit exchange site * Lincoln station, on the northeast corner of Coquitlam Centre * Lafarge Lake‚ÄìDouglas station, east side of Pinetree Way and north of Guildford Way Construction at Lougheed Town Centre station in March 2014 Two existing SkyTrain stations were upgraded to serve the Evergreen Extension: * Lougheed Town Centre station‚ÄîAn additional platform was constructed on the northeast side of the station, completing a roughed-in platform and track that were constructed previously in anticipation of the Evergreen Extension. This northeast platform (Platform 3) was originally used for eastbound trains travelling to Lafarge Lake‚ÄìDouglas. The southwest centre platform (Platforms 1 & 2) served the Lougheed branch of the Expo Line (Platform 2 westbound to Production Way‚ÄìUniversity and Platform 1 eastbound to Braid), as well as westbound Millennium Line trains to VCC‚ÄìClark (Platform 2), allowing for cross-platform transfers between those services. * Commercial‚ÄìBroadway station‚ÄîIncreased ridership was expected to lead to larger transfer volumes at Commercial‚ÄìBroadway station in Vancouver, already the busiest public transit hub in Metro Vancouver. As a result, as part of the Expo Line Upgrade Strategy, Commercial‚ÄìBroadway station received major upgrades to platforms and passageways to facilitate larger volumes of passengers. An additional side platform for passengers exiting Waterfront- bound trains (using a partial Spanish solution approach) was constructed, which saw the remodelling of the Safeway grocery store directly east of the station. This new platform was designed to relieve crowding on existing Platforms 3 and 4. Also included in the plan was a new pedestrian overpass over Broadway and a widened bridge above the Grandview Cut to the Millennium Line platforms. The design blueprints showed allowances for two future stations, at Queens Street in Port Moody and Falcon Drive in Coquitlam, should future development warrant their construction, according to the Evergreen Line project office. Also in the design plans was a short spur at Coquitlam Central station, added to allow for a possible future extension of the line to Port Coquitlam.

In physiological literature, it is given the name 20:3 (œâ‚àí6). DGLA is a carboxylic acid with a 20-carbon chain and three cis double bonds; the first double bond is located at the sixth carbon from the omega end. DGLA is the elongation product of Œ≥-linolenic acid (GLA; 18:3, œâ‚àí6). GLA, in turn, is a desaturation product (Delta 6 desaturase) of linoleic acid (18:2, œâ‚àí6). DGLA is made in the body by the elongation of GLA, by an efficient enzyme which does not appear to suffer any form of (dietary) inhibition. DGLA is an extremely uncommon fatty acid, found only in trace amounts in animal products.Horrobin, D. F., 1990a. Gamma linolenic acid. Rev. Contemp. Pharmacother. 1, 1-45Huang, Y.-S. and Mills, D. E. (Eds.), 1996. Gamma-linolenic acid metabolism and its roles in nutrition and medicine. AOCS Press, Champaign, Illinois, 319 pp.  Biological effects The eicosanoid metabolites of DGLA are: * Series-1 thromboxanes (thromboxanes with 1 double-bond), via the COX-1 and COX-2 pathways. * Series-1 prostanoids, via the COX-1 and COX-2 pathways. * A 15-hydroxyl derivative that blocks the transformation of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes. All of these effects are anti-inflammatory. This is in marked contrast with the analogous metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA), which are the series-2 thromboxanes and prostanoids and the series-4 leukotrienes. In addition to yielding anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, DGLA competes with AA for COX and lipoxygenase, inhibiting the production of AA's eicosanoids. Taken orally in a small study, DGLA produced antithrombotic effects. Supplementing dietary GLA increases serum DGLA, as well as serum AA levels. Cosupplementation with GLA and EPA lowers serum AA levels by blocking Œî-5-desaturase activity, while also lowering leukotriene synthesis in neutrophils.

He represented Mossley from 1918 to 1929 and 1931 to 1945. He was also a noted benefactor to local causes, and a strong believer in noblesse oblige. Early life Alfred Augustine Hopkinson was born in Manchester on 24 June 1879 the son of Sir Alfred Hopkinson KC who was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Manchester from 1900 to 1913 and also served as Member of Parliament for Cricklade in the 1890s and for Combined English Universities in the 1920s. Although sharing the academic approach of his father, he applied his experience more directly to the problems of industry rather than taking up posts in the universities. He became a Justice of the Peace for Lancashire. Ryecroft Hall In 1900 Hopkinson enlisted in the Imperial Yeomanry and served in the Second Boer War as a Lieutenant. On his return he founded a company, Pikrose (which bore the Audenshaw coat of arms as its company logo) at the Delta Works in Audenshaw. In 1908 he invented a revolutionary coal-cutting machine which his company made: he built a reputation as a very humane employer, and while the company was highly profitable he was uninterested in the trappings of wealth and lived frugally. Hopkinson was elected as a councillor on Audenshaw Council from 1917 to 1934 and led the council from 1923‚Äì24 and 1928‚Äì29. Long before it became fashionable, Hopkinson converted a derelict barn to a bungalow for his own home; he donated his former home of Ryecroft Hall (which he had bought in February 1913) to the people of Audenshaw and sixteen semi-detached houses on its land to Audenshaw Council (the Hall became a community centre as well as Audenshaw council's headquarters, and the houses were used for the housing of the working class). During the First World War he again enlisted and served in the Royal Dragoon Guards as a Second Lieutenant; in the later stages of the war he re-enlisted as a Trooper (the equivalent of Private) in the same unit. Entry to politics On 11 September 1918 news was received confirming that Oswald Cawley (Liberal MP for Prestwich) had been killed in action in Palestine on 22 August. Hopkinson was picked as a Government-supporting Liberal candidate to succeed him, although he was not a member of any party; he was returned unopposed at the by-election on 28 October. On taking his seat he wore his uniform as a Trooper of the Royal Dragoon Guards. Hopkinson did not have time to get acquainted with the House before the end of the war pitched him into a re-election battle. Owing to boundary changes he fought the new Mossley constituency where he was adopted as a Liberal who supported David Lloyd George's governing Coalition. However, during the campaign he said that calling himself the Coalition candidate did not bind him to supporting the Coalition, and that he might oppose anything the government did. He insisted that he had merely taken the 'badge' of the Coalition for the good of the country. Hopkinson faced opposition only from the Co-operative Party and won with more than 75% of the vote. Political activities Initially, as shown by his choice of taking his seat in uniform, Hopkinson was particularly active on military matters, calling for 'democracy under discipline' and a recognition that democratic forces were present when reconstructing the Army. He was a member of the House of Commons Army Committee in 1919, and the following year criticised the actions of Brigadier-General Dyer in the Amritsar massacre following the official report into it. Also in 1920 he criticised bureaucracy in the building of public housing, saying that he was building homes for a fraction of the price (it was in 1921 that he made his donation of Ryecroft Hall). By the end of 1920 Hopkinson was already making a reputation for being one of the best speakers and most independent minds in the House, although he was still officially sitting as a Coalition Liberal. He became increasingly involved in industrial topics in which he was critical of the trades unions (regarding them as having devoured the liberty of the workers) and of socialism to the level of distrusting the motives of those advocating socialist policies. He was a strong supporter of free trade. Hopkinson was much in demand as a speaker because of his unorthodox views and the frank and clear way in which he expressed them. Independence On 22 March 1922 Hopkinson wrote to The Times to suggest that ballot papers include a box in which voters could express their disapproval of all the candidates on offer. He was by now of this opinion himself: the previous month, he stopped receiving the Coalition Liberal whip, which he explained, his friends in the Liberal Party had been sending him by courtesy but which he had never considered binding. He strongly criticised as \\"humbug\\" the 1922 budget which reduced income tax without any corresponding reduction in government spending. At the 1922 general election Hopkinson therefore found himself opposed by an official Liberal Party candidate who had been Lord Mayor of Manchester in 1921‚Äì22. However, his local connections and good works saw Hopkinson re- elected with 58% of the vote. At the 1923 election, Hopkinson's outspoken support for free trade helped him fight off a renewed attempt by the Liberal Party to regain the seat, although his majority was reduced to only 375 votes. The local Conservative Party supported him at these elections, and despite his support for free trade he backed the Baldwin government in the motion of no confidence in January 1924. Hopkinson grew personally very friendly with Baldwin. At the Westminster Abbey by-election in March 1924, Hopkinson signed the nomination papers for Winston Churchill who had fallen out with the Liberal Party and was standing as an Independent Constitutionalist. Although Churchill failed on this occasion, it was only by 43 votes. At the 1924 general election, Hopkinson had opposition from both the Labour Party and the Liberals; he was re-elected more comfortably with Labour outpolling the Liberal candidate by more than two to one. Baldwin In March 1926 Hopkinson had the pleasure of formally introducing his father Alfred to the House of Commons, after he won a by-election in the Combined English Universities. His father was, unlike him, elected as a Conservative, although Hopkinson was a generally reliable vote for the Conservatives in this period. After the general strike he was critical of the actions of the trade unions. However, he opposed the Baldwin government's Trades Disputes Bill which restricted union powers, on the grounds that it would hinder those trade unionists committed to reform from changing their unions, and also hinder employers who were committed to improving the liberty of their employees. By the late 1920s, Hopkinson was expressing the hope that Stanley Baldwin would be elected as a free trader in order to save the country from David Lloyd George who had left the country open to socialism \\"and its twin brother, protection\\". He was again supported by the Conservatives in the 1929 general election, but in one of the shock results of the election, lost his seat by 5,029 votes to Herbert Gibson, the Labour candidate. Hopkinson kept up his contribution of articles expressing unorthodox thoughts to journals while out of Parliament, blaming the Wall Street Crash of 1929 on an American attempt to restrict imports. Return to Parliament At the 1931 general election Hopkinson attempted to regain his seat but found himself opposed by an official Conservative Party candidate as well as the sitting Labour MP. He declared himself a supporter of the National Government. Having unexpectedly lost in 1929, Hopkinson managed to win his seat back in an equally unexpected result. The Conservative candidate was in third place. Hopkinson continued to support free trade and Baldwin, and in the 1935 general election the putative Conservative candidate withdrew in his favour. Baldwin wrote to Hopkinson (under the salutation \\"Dear Hoppy\\") that \\"You have been one of my most loyal supporters in good times and in bad when I needed friends most\\". Hopkinson had a straight fight with Labour and the official backing of the National government, saying that he would take the National Government whip if elected. He won by only 2,170 votes in a constituency that was suffering in the economic difficulties. In March 1936 Hopkinson was injured in a flying accident, aviation having long been a private hobby. He was making a forced landing in bad weather near Warrington when his aeroplane overturned; fortunately it hit a hedge and did not crush him. Unluckily he suffered light injuries in a second accident the next month, at Rochester airport in Kent when his aircraft went into a spin. In March 1938 Hopkinson was hit by a car near his home, and had to recover in hospital. Rearmament and war Hopkinson's knowledge of flying led to his strong support for rearmament especially of the Royal Air Force and on 16 November 1938 he declared that the Chamberlain government's inadequate action in that area made it impossible for him to continue to support the government, and resigned the whip. In an article he wrote shortly after, he declared that Conservative Associations should not select \\"crooks and half-wits\\" as Parliamentary candidates. However he continued to back the government on the issue of Palestine. Hopkinson considered his warnings had been amply justified when the Second World War broke out. He re-enlisted at age 60, this time in the Royal Navy on the declaration of war, serving from 1939 to 1942. During breaks in his service he voted against Chamberlain after the Norway debate of 1940, and supported Churchill's policy of 'total war', but opposed the use of secret sessions of the House of Commons to suppress public criticism of the performance of Ministers. In 1942 a corrupted report of a speech of his was printed in the This England column of the New Statesman in which he was supposed to have declared himself an autocrat. Hopkinson sued for libel, describing the statement as a travesty. The New Statesman eventually agreed to pay 50 guineas to the RAF Benevolent Fund in damages, and Hopkinson's costs. The same erroneous report also appeared in Reynolds News and Hopkinson won ¬£500 damages from them. As the war was coming to an end, Hopkinson uncovered a financial scandal involving the Air Ministry and the British Overseas Airways Corporation in a speech on 19 December 1944. He opposed the outcome of the Yalta Conference which accepted a Soviet sphere of influence in eastern Europe. Later life At the 1945 general election, Hopkinson was for the first time opposed by all three main parties. He was by then in his mid-60s and had less ability to be active in his constituency, and also his outspoken criticisms of the Labour Party were not in line with the times. Not only did he lose his seat in the election, but he came in bottom of the poll with only 8% of the vote and thereby lost his deposit, the threshold being 12.5%. Hopkinson retired from politics but lived mainly in Westminster at 61 St George's Square. A portrait of him by William Dring was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1955. Hopkinson never married. References * Who's Who of British MPs, volume 3 by M. Stenton and S.

It is most famous for alleged Marian apparitions, controversial public visions of the Virgin Mary starting in 1931. Location Ezquioga is a dispersed farming township located at Latitude 43¬∞ 4' 60N, Longitude 2¬∞ 16' 0W, at an altitude of 555 meters above sea level, in the Goiherri region. There are no large cities nearby; Zumarraga, Spain, a nearby town, had a population of 10,265 in 2000. The Visions=Background= On April 14, 1931, the Second Spanish Republic was declared after anti-monarchist candidates won elections in urban areas throughout Spain, King Alfonso XIII of Spain abdicated. Many of the new government were Socialist or otherwise anti-clerical. However this did not spread to the religious Basque Country. In the elections on June 28, rightist coalitions won handily in Gipuzkoa and Navarra. On April 23, 1931, children playing in Torralba de Arag√≥n, in Huesca, saw and heard what they thought was the figure of the Virgin Mary inside the church, saying \\"Do not mistreat my son.\\". Catholic newspapers reported this vision throughout Spain. The child seers of Ezkioga allegedly read the Basque version in Argia, on May 5, 1931. On June 4, 12 girls and a boy, between 9 and 14 years old, saw an \\"unearthly\\" woman in mourning accompanied by a bright light in a church in the Basque town of Mendigorr√≠a.Visionaries: The Spanish Republic and the Reign of Christ Christian, William A., Jr. Visionaries: The Spanish Republic and the Reign of Christ. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1996.

Their own father did not believe them, but hundreds of others came to the hillside to see for themselves. Eventually, hundreds of thousands of mostly Basque devotees came to Ezquioga expecting to witness and perhaps even experience visions, and hundreds did. On the nights of July 12, 16, and 18, and October 16, up to eighty thousand persons turned out. In the first month there were over a hundred alleged seers. Occasional visions continued until the fall of 1933. Seers described blinding light, convulsed, many fell unconscious, and some bled. In 1933, bleeding crucifixes were reported around Ezquioga, seemingly as a retort to negative reports about the visionaries. =Reactions= Many rightist Basque nationalists, preparing for a civil war against the Republic, supported the visionaries, believing the visions were a sign that the Virgin Mary supported them. It also draw a certain amount of attention among the Catholics of Catalonia. The official church, on the other hand, soon turned against the seers. At the invitation of the diocese, Jose Antonio Laburu, a Jesuit, preached against the \\"mental contagion\\" of the Ezquioga visions at San Sebastian in April and June 1932, contrasting them against the \\"true\\" visions of Teresa of Avila and Thomas Aquinas. Similarly the Republican government tried to suppress the visions. RumorYo s√© lo que pasa en Ezquioga: notas de un reporter , Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Ramos, Imprenta Mart√≠n y Mena, San Sebasti√°n, 19?. A leaflet with the collections of a reporter who has met Francisco Goicoechea, \\"the visionary from Ataun\\" and other visionaries. had it that the President Manuel Aza√±a had sent Dr Gregorio Mara√±√≥n (then vacationing at San Sebasti√°n) to investigate. In the fall of 1932, Pedro del Pozo Rodr√≠guez, the governor of Gipuzkoa, briefly interned those who claimed to see visions at the provincial psychiatric hospital of Santa √Ågueda, Mondrag√≥n. The visions became a taboo subject in the region, and the visionaries went underground, meeting in small groups with loyal followers. In 1936, the Spanish Civil War came. It was not among Catholic and non-Catholics as many Ezquioga followers had expected: the Catholic Basque nationalists took the side of the Republic, while the also Catholic Navarrese Carlists took the side of the Francoist rebellion. Nevertheless, the Ezquioga visionaries keep meeting in secret and they were still doing so seventy years later. =Works= The Irish Catholic Hispanist Walter Starkie visited Ezquioga during the zenith of the apparitions and spent a whole chapter of his book Spanish Raggle-Taggle on them. He concluded quite convinced that the traditionalist and right-wing groups were using the Ezquioga events politically against the irreligious republic. William A. Christian, Jr., wrote a detailed and influential study of the event, Visionaries: The Spanish Republic and the Reign of Christ, , published in 1996, and an updated second edition published in Spanish in 2011, translated by Jos√© Luis Gil Aristu, El Reino de Cristo en la Segunda Rep√∫blica; un historia silenciada (Barcelona, Ariel), .

It forms the ulnar border of the palm and its spindle-like shape defines the hypothenar eminence of the palm together with the skin, connective tissue, and fat surrounding it. Its main function is to pull the little finger away from the other fingers (i.e. abduction). Structure The abductor digiti minimi arises from the pisiform bone, the pisohamate ligament, and the flexor retinaculum. Its distal tendon ends in three slips that are inserted into the ulnopalmar margin of the proximal phalanx, the palmar plate of the metacarpophalangeal joint, and the sesamoid bone when present. Some fibers insert into the finger's dorsal aponeurosis, which is why the muscle acts similar to a dorsal interosseus muscle. Additionally, the ulnar-most portion of the tendon inserts into the little finger's digital cord, and the muscle thus forms part of a structure that flexes the metacarpophalangeal joint and extends the interphalangeal joints. =Innervation= It is innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve (C8‚ÄìT1). =Development= The abductor digit minimi develops at an early stage from an ulnar muscle primordium of the superficial layer of the original undifferentiated mesenchyme of the hand, together with the flexor digitorum superficialis (medial primordia) and the abductor pollicis brevis (radial). In contrast, the remaining hypothenar muscles are derived from the deep layer at a later stage. =Variation= In rare cases accessory fascicles of the abductor digiti minimi have been found arising from the antebrachial fascia, the radius, and the ulna. The abductor digiti minimi is the most variable hypothenar muscle, and might be joined by accessory slips from the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, the flexor retinaculum, the fascia of the distal forearm, or the tendon of the palmaris longus. Occasionally, the muscle is partially inserted onto the fifth metacarpal bone. In case of polydactyly it may insert to the sixth finger instead, if there is one.  Function  It is an abductor of the little finger at the metacarpophalangeal joint.Origin, insertion and nerve supply of the muscle at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine It is also possible that the muscle contributes to extension of the middle phalanx of the little finger through its connection to finger's extensor mechanism. It plays an important role when the hand is grasping large objects with outspread fingers.  Etymology  The name is derived from the Latin -ab \\"away from\\"; ducere \\"to draw\\"; digitus, \\"digit\\"; and minimum, smallest; or quintus, \\"fifth\\", meaning \\"abductor of the smallest or fifth finger\\".

United Kingdom In the British Army's Royal Artillery master gunners are experts in the technical aspects of gunnery. They fill advisory rather than command posts. The appointment is split into two classes: Master gunners 2nd and 1st class, both holding the rank of warrant officer class 1. Formerly there was also an appointment of master gunner 3rd class, who held the rank of warrant officer class 2. The appointment of master gunner should not be confused with that of Master Gunner, St James's Park, who is the ceremonial head of the Royal Regiment of Artillery. =Historical usage= The Master Gunner's House (1748), Scarborough Castle. The title of master gunner was in use from at least the fourteenth century for the person commanding a team of gunners and directing the use and upkeep of one or more guns. The term gradually fell out of use on board ship (where the term 'gunner' took its place), and in the field (where the command structure of 'artillery traynes' took precedence). It remained in use, however, in coastal fortifications, from the time of Henry VIII through to 1956 when Britain's coastal artillery network was disbanded. Initially, master gunners had executive command of their guns in times of battle, but this responsibility ceased when commissioned Artillery officers began to be appointed to coastal forts and garrisons. Thereafter, the artillerymen took charge of aiming and firing the guns; but within each fortification the master gunner retained responsibility for gun maintenance and preparation, and for the safe storage and supply of ammunition. They were also responsible for firing gun salutes, and other routine tasks. To carry out these duties, each master gunner had to recruit a team of 'district gunners' to serve under them: in the 18th and 19th centuries detachments of 'invalids' (usually war-wounded artillerymen) often fulfilled this task; otherwise the master gunner would have to try to recruit regular artillery from a nearby garrison (or else local militiamen, volunteers or even civilians might be seconded). A list of 1824 records 59 master gunners at separate stations around the coast of the British isles, and 90 'invalids' assisting them. (The number of invalid artillery was set to increase, to 450 by 1859.) It is noted that every master gunner listed had served a minimum of sixteen years in the Royal Artillery prior to being appointed to that position. Master Gunner of England For some 250 years an official of the Board of Ordnance held the office of \\"Master Gunner of England\\" (Master Gunner of Great Britain after 1707). Mention of the office first occurs around 1485-1506; appointments were made by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm, and were normally for life. Until its dissolution in 1855, the Board (or Office) of Ordnance provided and operated all artillery pieces used in the field of battle and in defensive garrisons. The Master Gunner of England served as principal technical expert to the Crown in all aspects of artillery. He maintained a register of all certified gunners in the realm and oversaw their training, he maintained a list of all guns in forts, on board ships and elsewhere and monitored their state of readiness, and also had responsibilities for proving guns and gunpowder. Proof testing initially took place in an area known as the 'Artillery Garden' just north of the Tower of London (the Board's headquarters), and the Master Gunner of England was provided with an official residence nearby. As weapons were growing more powerful, however, it became desirable for them to be proved in less populated areas, and this (among other things) led to the Crown in the 1670s purchasing an area of open land known as the Warren, at Woolwich in Kent, on the south bank of the Thames (the area soon developed into a centre for arms manufacture, and was later renamed the Royal Arsenal). In 1685 the Artillery Garden was sold, and the Master Gunner himself moved to the Warren, where he was housed on site (along with the local Ordnance Storekeeper) in a Tudor mansion known as Tower Place. (Proof testing of guns and artillery continued at the Woolwich site until the mid-19th century, at which point this activity was (once again) moved to a larger and less populated area: to Shoeburyness on the Essex coast.) The last Master Gunner to reside at Woolwich (Col. George Brown) died in 1702; his successor (Capt. Thomas Silver) already held the office of Master Gunner of Whitehall & St James's Park, and as such he continued to reside in the Gun House by the Park. The office of Master Gunner of Great Britain became obsolescent after the Board of Ordnance established its Regiment of Artillery at Woolwich in 1716; in that year, the Master- General recommended its abolition as part of a series of economies, and it disappeared with the death of the last incumbent (Col. James Pendlebury RA) in 1731. United States Master gunner, commonly referred to as \\"Mike Golf,\\" is also an advanced skill of the armor, infantry and artillery branches of the U.S. Army, and the tank and assault amphibious vehicle occupational field (OccFld 18) of the U.S. Marine Corps. It requires advanced schooling, and a high degree of skill. Only a few of those entering the training school graduate. The rank and rate of master gunner, along with a distinctive insignia, was used by the U.S. Army during World War I.ASSAULT AMPHIBIAN SCHOOLMASTER GUNNER PROGRAM, trngcmd.marines.mil, last accessed 5 February 2020 In the U.S. Army, the master gunner is the technical and tactical experts for their weapon's platform. They advises the commander on everything related to the vehicle platform and weapon's system. They also develop training materials to conduct gunnery and live-fire exercises. \\"I rely on my master gunners. I probe them for information based on how best to maintain our weapons as well as train our crews... They are there every step of the way from the time we put those crews together until the time we qualify them...,\\" said Captain Kevin Zhang of the 1st Cavalry Division (1st Cav). \\"Master gunners are trained in methodology... What it boils down to is knowing the standard and being that person in the unit to enforce the standard, and to make sure that people are qualifying correctly... We're also experts in current gun maintenance so we can troubleshoot and fix a lot of problems and issues that may occur at the range, on the spot, instead of having to fall back to unit mechanics,\\" explained Sergeant 1st Class Nathan Quarberg of 1st Cav.Master gunners bring expertise to brigade combat team, army.mil, by Staff Sergeant Jennifer Bunn, dated 2 January 2019, last accessed 5 February 2020. The primary mission of the army master gunner is to aid and assist commanders at all echelons in the planning, development, execution, and evaluation of all crew-served weapons related training (individual, crew, and collective). The master gunner's specific duties are directed by the commander. Examples of his duties are: * Develop or conduct training and certification of vehicle crew evaluators. * Assist all elements within the unit concerning gunnery training. * Forecast all ammunition and ranges for training. * Manage gunnery records, gunnery skills testing records, and turbulence rosters. * Coordinate and control training devices. * Execute gunnery training. * Supervise live-fire ranges to ensure all standards are followed; specifically: Confirm screening and zero techniques Coordinate target arrays, exposure times for all targets, and maneuver box verification * Set up all ranges to make sure they meet the standards set forth in this manual * Set up and conduct gunnery skills training, and evaluate the results. * Advise the commander of the tactical capabilities of all weapons and weapon systems. The master gunner's main responsibilities are listed above, but may change in scope, depending on the level that he is assigned. The master gunner should not be assigned additional duties other than those listed here. Unit gunnery training programs need a great deal of attention to be effective. =Master gunner's duties by position= ;Brigade master gunner Works closely with the master gunners at lower echelons to ensure standards are uniform throughout the training programs.

Costebelle served in the French Navy as early as 1683, and in 1692 served as lieutenant to a marine infantry company sent to Plaisance, the principal French settlement on Newfoundland. There he was immediately involved in defending the port from English naval assaults in the ongoing King William's War, and embarked on raiding expeditions against English settlements on the island. Costebelle distinguished himself, and was promoted to captain in 1694, and lieutenant in 1695. That year he was ordered to improve the fortifications and establish contact with the English colonists in St. Mary's Bay. In 1696 Costebelle was sent to France, and thus did not participate in Pierre LeMoyne d'Iberville's celebrated and destructive Avalon Peninsula Campaign. When he returned to Plaisance in 1697 he had hoped to succeed to the governorship, but was instead forced to continue in the role of king's lieutenant under first Joseph de Monic and then Daniel d'Auger de Subercase. Monic was frequently absent from the colony, so Costebelle spent a significant time during Monic's tenure in actual command of the colony. In 1702, while awaiting Subercase's arrival, Costebelle rallied the province's defences against Captain John Leake's raiding expedition that brought Queen Anne's War (the War of the Spanish Succession) to Newfoundland. Subercase arrived to take command in 1703, and adopted a vigorous strategy against the English. In 1705 he led a raiding expedition against English outposts that sought to repeat d'Iberville's successes in 1696. Costebelle went on the expedition, but was injured in an accident en route and saw no action. Subercase's expedition was partly successful, destroying many English settlements, but he was unable to take St. John's. Subercase was rewarded with the governorship of Acadia, and Costebelle was finally appointed governor of Plaisance in 1706. In June 1708 he was awarded the Order of Saint Louis. In December 1708 Costebelle organized a successful attack on the British at St. John's. Although he captured the town and its fortress, he did not have the resources to hold it, and it was eventually reoccupied by the English. By the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 Newfoundland was handed over to Britain and the king of France ordered Costebelle to evacuate the colony in the spring of 1714. Costebelle oversaw the evacuation of French subjects from Newfoundland to Cape Breton Island, where the colony of √éle-Royale was established. Costebelle became its first governor, and oversaw the establishment of Louisbourg (although construction of its fortress was not begun until after his death). Costebelle returned to France briefly in 1717, and died at Fort Dauphin (satellite fort of Louisbourg) not long after his return in October 1717. Costebelle was twice married, and had two daughters.

Winter Sports in Australia encompasses a great variety of activities across the continent of Australia, including winter sports played in snow and ice such as ice hockey. Climate varies considerably from the tropical North to temperate South in Australia, and sporting practices vary accordingly. Ice and snow sports like Skiing in Australia are conducted in the high country of the Australian Alps and Tasmanian Wilderness. Australia has relatively low mountain ranges, but a long history of participation in recreational skiing (since the 1860s) and the Winter Olympic Games (since 1936). Australians have won olympic gold in ice skating, skiing and snow- boarding events. Australia's generally flat geography and usually mild winter climate otherwise provide ideal conditions for international non-snow/ice winter sports and team games like Rugby Union Football, Rugby league Football and Association Football (Soccer), which are all popular sports during the Australian winter and in which Australia has enjoyed considerable international success. Australian rules football is a home-grown winter football code with a wide following throughout Australia. Many other sports are also played or watched in Australia through the winter season.  Sports played in winter  Kiandra Snow Shoe Carnival, 1900. Australia's mild winters mean that in most parts of Australia, regular outdoor sports can be played all year, and indeed more vigorous sports are more comfortably played in winter. Australian rules football and rugby league, the two most popular spectator sports in Australia, are played primarily in winter. See Sport in Australia Ice sports in Australia began with the opening of the first ice skating rink in Australia, the Adelaide Glaciarium, designed by a refrigeration technician by the name of Henry Newman Reid. On Wednesday 1 June 1904, the prospectus for the acquisition of the Cyclorama building on 89 Hindley Street, Adelaide was issued. The remodeled Cyclorama building opened as the Glaciarium on the evening of Tuesday 6 September 1904. Skating and ice sports were played in the venue. An ice polo league called the Warehouseman's League was formed, a sport in which was often refererred to as 'hockey on the ice' but was not actually ice hockey. It wasn't until Reid built his second rink in Melbourne, Victoria named the Melbourne Glaciarium, that ice hockey began. The Melbourne Glaciarium opened on the afternoon of 9 June 1906, at 16 City Road, South Melbourne Victoria.  Turf sports  Australia's National Rugby League Team, Brisbane 2009. Juniors playing polocrosse in NSW, Australia = Rugby Union = Reports of rugby union being played in Australia date back to the 1820s, with local clubs established by the 1860s. The game has been especially popular as a winter sport in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian national rugby union team is called the Wallabies. Since the 1920s the Wallabies have worn green and gold jerseys. Despite having a relatively small player base, mainly in NSW and Queensland, the national side has twice won the Rugby World Cup - in 1991 and 1999. Australia hosted the 2003 Rugby World Cup, which saw the Wallabies defeated by England in the final at Telstra Stadium. Other notable competitions include the annual Bledisloe Cup played against Australia's traditional rivals, the New Zealand All Blacks since 1931, and the Tri-Nations competition involving South Africa and New Zealand. Australia has produced a number of notable rugby players of national stature, including Sir Edward Dunlop, Mark Ella (one of the first indigenous Australians to captain a national side) and the prolific try scorer David Campese. = Rugby League = In 1908, rugby league was established in Australia by former rugby union players and supporters as a breakaway professional code. The new code gained and has maintained a wider following in Australia than rugby union, which remained amateur until the 1990s. It has traditionally been seen as a \\"working man's sport\\" with its roots in the working class communities of the northern English counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire translating to similar areas of Western Sydney and Brisbane. Rugby league is the most popular winter sport in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The elite club competition is the National Rugby League (NRL), which features ten teams from New South Wales, three teams from Queensland, and one team each from Victoria, Australian Capital Territory and New Zealand. The season culminates in the premiership deciding game, the NRL Grand Final, traditionally one of Australia's most popular sporting events and one of the largest club championship matches in the world. Rugby League is played in all Australian states and territories, but has a much reduced participation in the southern and western states. The New South Wales Blues and Queensland Maroons play a representative series against each other every year, called the State of Origin series, which is one of Australia's major sporting events. In addition, the Australian Kangaroos represent the country in international matches. Since its inception in 1954, the Australian team has dominated the Rugby League World Cup, having won the competition nine times. =Australian Rules Football= Australian rules football (usually called \\" Football, Aussie rules\\" or \\"AFL\\") is a popular spectator sport and a participation sport in all Australian states and territories, though its core support lies in four of the six states; Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The national competition, the Australian Football League, evolved from a Victorian state competition. The AFL Grand Final is traditionally played each year at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Australian rules football culture has a strong set of rituals and traditions, many of which have crossed sporting boundaries in Australia. .66 =Soccer= Soccer is a high participation football code, with both boys and girls at junior level as well with men and women at senior level. A number of major international stars have played for the national team in recent years including Tim Cahill, Mark Viduka, Mark Schwarzer and Harry Kewell. Australia's national team, the Socceroos, as of 2016 has competed at four FIFA World Cups. The Australian Government sought to host the event, the world's most watched sporting event, in either 2018 or 2022 but the bid failed. =Polocrosse= Polocrosse is an equine team sport that was developed in New South Wales before the Second World War. This sport is now played by men, women and juniors in many parts of the world.  Snow sports  Ladies' Toboggan Race, Kiandra, c. 1884‚Äì1917 Mount Hotham ski resort, Victoria Perisher is Australia's largest ski resort =Alpine Skiing= During the Southern Hemisphere winter, snow skiing and snow boarding takes place in the high country of the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, and cross-country skiing is also possible in the Australian Capital Territory. New South Wales is home to Australia's highest snow country, oldest skifields and largest resorts. The highest peak in New South Wales is Mount Kosciuszko, at 2200m. Victoria is the State with the greatest number of ski resorts in Australia. The highest peak in Victoria is Mount Bogong at 1986m.http://www.ga.gov.au/education/geoscience-basics/landforms/highest- mountains.jsp The most northerly ski fields in Australia are located in the A.C.T. - in the Brindabella Ranges which rise to the west of Canberra, the capital city of Australia, and include the Namadgi National Park in the A.C.T. and Bimberi Nature Reserve and Brindabella National Park in New South Wales. The highest mountain in the ACT is Bimberi Peak, which lies above the treeline at 1912 metres, at the northern edge of the Snowy Mountains. The most southerly ski fields in Australia are located in Tasmania, a mountainous island off the southern coast of Eastern Australia. Much of the State is subject to at least occasional winter snows. Mount Ossa is the highest point on the island at 1614m but Tasmania has eight mountains exceeding 1500m and 28 above 1,220m. Also notable is the Central Plateau, at an elevation of around 900m. The capital city of Hobart is built at the base of Mount Wellington, which at 1270m is snow-capped in winter.http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/876720A0621CD8E5CA25710E00756155?opendocument# Skiing began in Australia at the goldrush town of Kiandra, New South Wales around 1861. The Kiandra snow shoe club founded around that time (now called the Kiandra Pioneer Ski Club (1861)) remains the world's first identifiable and ceaseless Ski Club.http://members.ozemail.com.au/~sealark/skiing_history.html The Club held separate ski races for both ladies and children as early as 1885. In 1908 the club held the first ever documented International and Intercontinental Downhill Skiing Carnival. Results- America 1st, Australia 2nd, England 3rd.The Melbourne Argus, 6 July 1908. The first Kosciuszko Chalet was built at Charlotte Pass in 1930, giving relatively comfortable access to Australia's highest terrain. The first Australian ski tow was constructed near Mount Buffalo, Victoria in 1936. It was the construction of the vast Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme from 1949 that really opened up the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales for large scale development of a ski industry and led to the establishment of Thredbo, Perisher and Guthega as leading Australian resorts.http://www.thredbo.com.au/about- thredbo/history/http://www.perisherblue.com.au/winter/info/history.html Australian skiers competed in the Winter Olympics for the first time in Oslo 1952 and have competed in all subsequent Games, winning medals at every Games since 1998.http://www.olympics.com.au/australian-team/aus-at-the-winter- olympics Malcolm Milne became the first non-European to win a ski race world cup in 1969 and Olympic medalists include Zali Steggall, Alisa Camplin and Dale Begg-Smith. Australia has extensive skiable terrain during the southern hemisphere winter in the south eastern states and Australian Capital Territory, between elevations of around 1250m to 2200m. Elevation of the snowfields in Australia varies with latitude, however viable winter snows are generally found above 1500m: Thredbo, near mount Kosciuszko, has Australia's highest lifted point at 2037m and its base elevation is 1365m. Kiandra, in the Northern Skifields, has an elevation of 1400m, while Mount Mawson near Hobart, Tasmania is at 1250m. A number of well serviced resorts have been developed, including: Thredbo, Perisher, Charlotte Pass and Selwyn Snowfields in New South Wales; Mount Buller, Falls Creek, Mount Hotham, Mount Baw Baw and Mount Buffalo in Victoria; as well as the small resorts of Ben Lomond and Mount Mawson in Tasmania. Cross country skiing is popular in such national parks as Kosciuszko National Park and Alpine National Park and is also possible within Namadgi National Park and in the Tasmanian Wilderness. The Australian Alps are within driving range for weekend trips for residents of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, while Tasmanian ski slopes are within day trip range for residents of the state. In 2004, a mogul course called \\"Toppa's Dream\\" was constructed on Blue Cow.Alpha Magazine: \\"The Short and Bumpy Road\\" February 2006. The Mount Buller World Aerials is an annual event, the first on the World Cup calendar. Aerial skiers practice extensively on water before trying jumps on snow, and Camplin practised jumps in a pond in Wandin (one hour's drive from Melbourne).Sports Illustrated: She comes from the land Down Under: Aussie aerialist Camplin captures gold in dramatic fashion 18 February 2002.

The only Australian Biathlon training course is located at Dinner Plain, Victoria near Mount Hotham. =Cross country and back country skiing= Kosciuszko Main Range. Cradle Mountain in Tasmania's UNESCO World Heritage Wilderness Area The Kosciuszko Main Range in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales offer some of the most challenging cross-country and back-country skiing in Australia, notably Watsons Crags and Mount Twynam on the steep Western Face of the Range. The Mount Jagungal wilderness area provides some of the most isolated back-country ski terrain. High country huts, often a legacy of the era of cattle grazing in the mountains, provide emergency shelter in these regions. Dedicated Cross Country ski resorts are located at Lake Mountain, Mount Stirling and Mount St Gwinear in Victoria and popular areas for back country skiing and ski touring in the Alpine National Park, Yarra Ranges National Park and the Baw Baw National Park include: Mount Bogong, Mount Feathertop, Bogong High Plains, Mount Howitt, Mount Reynard and Snowy Plains. The Kangaroo Hoppet is a leg of the Worldloppet cross-country race series which is conducted on the last Saturday of August each year, hosted by Falls Creek in Victoria. The showpiece 42-kilometre race attracts thousands of spectators and competitors. Cross country skiing can be possible in the Brindabella Ranges which rise to the west of Canberra, in the A.C.T, and include the Namadgi National Park and Bimberi Nature Reserve. Mount Franklin Chalet, built in 1938, in the A.C.T. played a pioneering role in providing lifted ski runs in Australia, however the chalet was converted to a museum and subsequently destroyed by fire in 2003, so today only cross country skiing can be practised in the area (when conditions allow). Cross Country skiing is also practised at Mount Gingera, elevation 1855m, a prominent snow-covered peak above the city of Canberra.INSTRUMENT NO. 111 OF 1999 ACT Legislation When conditions allow, Australia's rugged island State of Tasmania also offers cross country skiers some scenic terrain - notably in the UNESCO World Heritage area around Cradle Mountain.http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/index.aspx?base=391 Tasmania has 28 mountains above 1,220m and much of the island is subject to at least occasional winter snow. The Australian High Country is populated by unique flora and fauna including wombats, wallabies, echidnas, and the Snow Gum. The Alpine regions are subject to environmental protection, which has limited the scope of commercial development of skiiable terrain,See \\"Kosciuszko National Park: Contemporary Management\\".

A national team was supposed to participate in the 2011 World Championship. The flag was even on the poster.A poster showing the Australian flag However, a late cancellation was made because of the floodings. There was also speculation about participation in the first Asian championship in 2012, a tournament which did not in the end take place. =Curling= Curling facilities are limited in Australia. There is curling at Sydney Ice Arena in New South Wales, while curling also occurs in MelbourneForever skating on thin ice and is also played in Brisbane.Queensland Curling and at Cockburn Ice Arena, Perth, Western Australia. = Ice Hockey = Melbourne Mustangs and Adelaide Adrenaline of the Australian Ice Hockey League. 14 Aug 2014 The first recorded game of ice hockey in Australia was on Tuesday 17 July 1906 and was between a Victorian representative team and the American sailors from the visiting American Warship the USS Baltimore. This game was held in the Melbourne Glaciarium, the Australian team were dressed in all white and the team from USS Baltimore wore white shirts with a large upper case black B on the front and center of the chest and grey trousers with red socks. The skill level of the Australians was not seen to be up to the level of the Americans but the game was hard-fought and result of the game was a 1‚Äì1 tie. Ice Hockey Australia is the official national governing body of ice hockey in Australia and is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation. Its beginnings can be traced back to 12 September 1908 when the formation of the first ice hockey association in Australia occurred in a meeting at the Melbourne Glaciarium occurred directly after an evening ice hockey game between the Brighton Ice Hockey Club and the Melburnians, which resulted in a 2‚Äì2 tie. The meeting was for the purpose of organising a club for the following season Australia owns the oldest ice hockey trophy outside of North America called the Goodall Cup, it was first awarded 4 September 1909 and donated by John Edwin Goodall. The Goodall Cup now resides in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Canada. Australia has a national hockey league called the Australian Ice Hockey League to represent the highest level of competition in the country, the Goodall Cup is awarded to the AIHL playoff champions. Australia has a national woman's league (Australian Women's Ice Hockey League) and junior league (Australian Junior Ice Hockey League). Along with the national leagues, each state and the Australian Capital Territory have league hockey. National tournaments are also held each year for 5 different age categories to represent their state in a weekend competition, the longest running is the Jim Brown Memorial Tournament which has existed since 1964. =Skating= Many major Australian cities have indoor ice rinks, enabling participation in some winter sports regardless of the city's climate - for example, subtropical Brisbane is a major short track speed skating hub for Australia. Sydney hosted the 1991 short track speed skating World Championships (in which Australia won the men's relay event), and the 2001 Goodwill Games, hosted in Brisbane, included figure skating. The Duke Trophy hosted annually by the Australian Amateur Ice Racing Council encourages interstate competition in short track speed skating. Short-track speedskater Steven Bradbury won the 1,000 m event at the 2002 Winter Olympics. He was the first Australian, and first individual from the Southern Hemisphere, to win a Winter Olympic gold medal and was also part of the short track relay team that won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal (a bronze in 1994).

He wrote numerous books on theology, ideology, faith, hermeneutics, and social justice, and was an outspoken critic of what he perceived as Church callousness toward oppression and suffering. He was a physician by training. Biography In 1941, he joined the Society of Jesus and studied at Jesuit seminaries at C√≥rdoba and the Seminary of San Miguel, both in Argentina, and later at the Faculty of Theology San Alberto in Louvain, Belgium (where he met fellow student Gustavo Guti√©rrez). He was ordained in 1955. He obtained his licenciate in 1958, with his thesis \\"La Cristiandad, una utop√≠a?\\" Between 1958 and 1963 he studied for the Doctorat d'Etat in the Faculty of Letters of the Sorbonne, from which he received his doctorate. His thesis was titled \\"Berdiaeff, una reflexi√≥n cristiana sobre la persona.\\" He returned to Uruguay and in Montevideo he started \\"Cursos de Complementaci√≥n Cristiana\\", in which he analysed political, social and economic problems in the light of Catholic faith. He gave these courses between 1961 and 1964, at the same time he did other work in the continent, collaborating in Chile with Roger Vekemans in political typology in his \\"Ensayo de tipolog√≠a socioecon√≥mica latinoamericana\\" and with Renato Poblete in the \\"Ensayo de tipolog√≠a pol√≠tica de Am√©rica Latina\\" (published by OEA in Washington in 1961). In 1965, he co-founded the Peter Faber Center of Theological and Social Studies (Centro de Investigaci√≥n y Acci√≥n Social \\"Pedro Fabro\\"), which was closed by the Uruguayan government in the 1970s. The Center dedicated itself to investigating the interrelations between society and religion. Some work was published in the review, Perspectivas de Di√°logo. With his experience in the Center, Segundo wrote his fundamental work, Teolog√≠a abierta para el laico adulto, in five volumes, published in Argentina by the Editorial Carlos Lohl√©. After that, he has traveled, lectured and taught at universities in Brazil, Canada, and the United States. In 1970 he met in Petr√≥polis, Brazil, other Latin American theologians who started the Theology of Liberation. Together with the Peruvian theologian Gustavo Guti√©rrez, Segundo was one of the founders of the movement. In fact, his prominent book The Liberation of Theology, was a series of lectures taken place in 1974 at Harvard Divinity School. In 1974 he had the distinction of \\"Best Book in 1974 Liturgy\\" of the Catholic Press Association of New York for The Sacraments Today, vol. 4 of A Theology for Artisans of a New Humanity.

Midland Trail in Ceredo, West Virginia. The Midland Trail, also called the Roosevelt Midland Trail, was a national auto trail spanning the United States from Washington, D.C. west to Los Angeles, California and San Francisco, California ( though the Lincoln Highway guide published in 1916 states the original eastern terminus was in New York City ). First road signed in 1913, it was one of the first, if not the first, marked transcontinental auto trails in America. Early routing White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. Note signage indicating the Midland Trail The early routing of the Midland Trail, from east to west, began in either New York City or Washington, D.C. and continued through Richmond and Clifton Forge, Virginia to Charleston, West Virginia and passed on through Morehead, Kentucky to Lexington, Kentucky; Louisville, Kentucky; Vincennes, Indiana; Salem, Illinois; St. Louis, Missouri; Sedalia, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri and Topeka, Kansas; to Limon, Colorado and then on to Denver, Colorado. From Denver, the original routing split several ways to cross the rockies via Berthoud Pass, Tennessee Pass, Cochetopa Pass, and Monarch Pass. All routings converged in Grand Junction, Colorado and continued into Utah through Green River, Utah and Salt Lake City. Past Salt Lake City, the routing moved southward across the Salt Lake Desert on the same routing as the Lincoln Highway through Iosepa, Utah, Orr's Ranch, Fish Springs Ranch, and Ibapah, Utah. This part of the route was never popular, the state favoring the Victory Highway routing to the north, which is the basic alignment later followed by Interstate 80, and is now largely inaccessible as it is part of the Dugway Proving Grounds. In central Nevada, the highway continued across the Great Basin Desert through Ely and Tonopah then turning south at Goldfield in the Amargosa Desert and then west into California at Lida and over the Inyo Mountains and White Mountains through Westgard Pass. At the junction in Big Pine, California in the Owens Valley, the original routing then split into four options: *The first through Mammoth Lakes, Mono Lake, Yosemite, and Stockton to San Francisco. *The second through Bridgeport, California, Lake Tahoe, and Placerville to Sacramento and then San Francisco. *The third south through Independence and Mojave in the Mojave Desert, and then west through Tehachapi Pass to the San Joaquin Valley, and then northward through Merced and Modesto to San Francisco. *The fourth continuing southward from Mojave through Willow Springs to Los Angeles. By the time the Automobile Club of Southern California had prepared their 1917 map of the state, the fourth routing, through Mojave and Willow Springs to Los Angeles, had become the main routing for the Midland Trail in California. Realignment Following a major realignment of the route and assumption into the state highway system around 1922, the main Midland Trail alignment in California bypassed early stagecoach-era stops at Freeman and Willow Springs and at the Neuralia railroad siding, and now routed through Red Rock Canyon to Mojave. The earlier alignment took a high line route to the west in the Sierra Nevada and Scodie Mountains foothills around it following the Los Angeles Aqueduct route past Jawbone Canyon, thence following the Southern Pacific railroad tracks through Rosamond and Lancaster and on to Los Angeles, following the route that was later assigned to U.S. Route 6‚Äîthe Sierra Highway) in 1937. Various alignments of this portion of the trail followed the late 19th century Twenty-mule team roads built to haul gold from the Cerro Gordo Mines across the Mojave Desert. and roads built for the early 20th century construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. Routing Using the present road names, the highway approximately used the following route: *U.S. Route 60, Newport News, Virginia to Richmond, Virginia *U.S. Route 1, State Route 54 (Virginia), U.S. Route 33, State Route 22 (Virginia), and U.S. Route 250, Richmond to Staunton, Virginia *Two alternate routes - U.S. Route 11 and U.S. Route 60 or State Route 42 (Virginia), State Route 39 (Virginia), and U.S. Route 220, Staunton to Covington, Virginia *U.S. Route 60, Covington to Louisville, Kentucky *U.S. Route 150 and U.S. Route 50, Louisville to Kansas City, Missouri *K-10 (Kansas) and U.S. Route 24, Kansas City to Limon, Colorado *U.S. Route 40, Limon to Denver, Colorado *U.S. Route 40, Denver, former Colorado State Highway 11 (1923), (Kremmling, Colorado-Wolcott, Colorado), U.S. Route 6, and U.S. Route 89, to Salt Lake City *Old Lincoln Highway, Salt Lake City to Ely, Nevada An alternate route, approved in 1922, followed U.S. Route 6 from Santaquin, Utah (south of Salt Lake City) to Ely.Eureka Reporter, Grand Central Highway Now Alternate Route , June 30, 1922, p. 1 *U.S. Route 6, Ely, Nevada, U.S. Route 395, State Route 14 (California), and San Fernando Road, San Fernando Valley, to Los Angeles References=Sources= *Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas, 1926, accessed via the Broer Map Library: shows the entire route except in Missouri and Colorado *Clason Map Company, Touring Atlas of the United States, 1925 *Lincoln Highway Road Guide, 1917 (republished c1967) *USGS Survey Maps, Mojave and Willow Springs quadrangles, 1913 and 1917 respectively *Field checking conducted in 2005, 2006 and 2007 External links *National Auto Trails - Midland Trail Category:Auto trails in the United States Category:U.S. Route 60 Category:U.S. Route 6 Category:Historic trails and roads in California Category:U.S. Route 1 Category:U.S. Route 150 Category:U.S. Route 40 Category:Lincoln Highway Category:U.S. Route 33 Category:U.S. Route 250 Category:U.S. Route 11 Category:U.S. Route 50 Category:U.S. Route 24 Category:U.S. Route 89 Category:U.S. Route 395 ","title":"Midland Trail"},{"id":"3950882","text":"Colegrove may refer to: *Colegrove (surname), surname (includes list) *Colegrove, Los Angeles, settlement now part of Hollywood *Colegrove, Pennsylvania *Colegrove v.

He was the author of Restauration der Staatswissenschaften (Restoration of the Science of the State, 1816‚Äì1834), a book which Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel strongly criticized in Elements of the Philosophy of Right. This work, which was burnt during the Wartburg festival, opposed nationalism and the bureaucracy of extensive government (including democratic governments). Early life Von Haller was a son of Berne statesman and historian Gottlieb Emanuel von Haller, and grandson of poet and polymath Albrecht von Haller. He did not, however, receive an extensive education, but only some private lessons and a few classes at the Gymnasium. He was compelled at the age of fifteen to enter the chancery of the Republic of Berne. He studied by himself and so filled out the gaps in his education. At the age of nineteen, he was appointed to the important office of Kommissionsschreiber, or clerk of a public commission. In this capacity, he obtained an insight into methods of government, practical politics, and criminal procedure. As secretary of the Swiss diet held in Baden and Frauenfeld, he became familiar with the conditions of things in the Swiss Confederation. A journey to Paris in 1790 made him acquainted with new revolutionary ideas. As secretary of legation he served several important embassies, for instance, one to Geneva in 1792, about the Swiss troops stationed there; to Ulm in 1795, regarding the import of grain from southern Germany; to Lugano, Milan, and Paris in 1797, regarding the neutral attitude of Switzerland towards the warring powers. These journeys acquainted him with leading personalities of the day including Napoleon, Talleyrand, and others. When the old Swiss Confederation was threatened he was dispatched to Rastatt to allay the storm. It was too late, however, and when he returned in February, 1798, the French army was already on Bernese territory. Even his pamphlet, \\"Projekt einer Constitution f√ºr die schweizerische Republik Bern\\", was unable to stay the dissolution of the old Swiss Republic. But he soon renounced the principles expressed in this pamphlet, and became uncompromising opponent of the Revolution. Thereupon he resigned the government office he had held under the revolutionary authorities and established a paper, the Helvetische Annalen, in which he attacked their excesses and legislative schemes with such bitter sarcasm that the sheet was suppressed, and he himself had to flee to escape imprisonment. Henceforth, von Haller was a reactionary and a divisive figure. After many wanderings, he came to Vienna, where he was court secretary of the council of war, from 1801 till 1806. Public opinion at home resulted in his being recalled by the Bernese Government in 1806, and appointed professor of political law at the newly founded higher school of the academy. When the old aristocratic regime was reinstated, he became a member of the sovereign Great Council, and soon after also of the privy council of the Bernese Republic. But in 1821, when his return to Catholicism became known, he was dismissed. This change of religion caused great controversy, and the letter he wrote to his family from Paris, explaining his reasons for the step he had taken, went through about fifty editions in a short time, was translated into nearly every modern language, and called forth numerous rejoinders and apologies. In this document he made known his long-felt inclination to join the Catholic Church and his growing conviction that he must bring his political opinions in harmony with his religious views. His family soon followed him; with them he left Berne for ever and took up his residence in Paris. There the Foreign Office invited him to assume the instruction of candidates for the diplomatic service in constitutional and international law. After the July Revolution of 1830, he went to Solothurn and, from that time until the day of his death, was a contributor to political journals, including the Neue preussische zeitung and the Historisch-Politische Bl√§tter. In 1833 he was again elected to the Grand Council of Switzerland and exercised an important influence in ecclesiastical affairs which constituted the burning question of the hour. In connection with his other work, Haller had propounded and defended his political opinions as early as 1808 in his Handbuch der allgemeinen Staatenkunde, des darauf begr√ºndeten allgemeinen Rechts und der allgemeinen Straatsklugheit nach den Gesetzen der Natur. This, considered by some his most important work, impelled Johannes von M√ºller to offer Haller the chair of constitutional law at the University of G√∂ttingen. In spite of the great honour involved in this offer, he declined it. Restauration Haller's magnum opus, however, was the Restauration der Staats-Wissenschaft oder Theorie des nat√ºrlich-geselligen Zustandes, der Chim√§re des k√ºnstlich-b√ºrgerlichen entgegengesetzt. It was published in Winterthur in six volumes from 1816 to 1834. In this he uncompromisingly rejects the revolutionary conception of the State, and constructs a natural and juridical system of government, arguing at the same time that a commonwealth can endure and prosper without being founded on the omnipotence of the state and official bureaucracy. The first volume, which appeared in 1816, contains his history and his rejection of the older political theories, and also sets forth the general principles of his system of government. In the succeeding volumes he shows how these principles apply to different forms of government: in the second to monarchies; in the third (1818) to military powers; in the fourth (1820) and fifth (1834) to ecclesiastical states; and in the sixth (1825) to republics. It was written primarily to counteract Jean-Jacques Rousseau's The Social Contract. Moreover, Haller's \\"Digression on Slavery\\" in the third volume made a deep impact on the Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle and surfaced again in his polemical \\"Occasional Discourse on the Nigger Question\\".Hans F√§ssler: Une Suisse esclavagiste. Voyage dans un pays au-dessus de tout soup√ßon. (Pr√©face de Doudou Di√®ne). Duboiris, Paris 2007, pp. 142-145 The book in its entirety was translated into Italian, part of it into French, and an abridged version into English, Latin and Spanish. All his later writings are influenced by the ideas here set forth, and oppose vigorously the revolutionary tendencies of the times and the champions of liberalism in Church and State.

The work was based upon Le Corbusier‚Äôs Ville Radieuse (Radiant City) book of 1935 and urban studies undertaken by the Congr√®s International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) in the early 1930s. The Charter got its name from location of the fourth CIAM conference in 1933, which, due to the deteriorating political situation in Russia, took place on the S.S. Patris bound for Athens from Marseilles. This conference is documented in a film commissioned by Sigfried Giedion and made by his friend Laszlo Moholy-Nagy: \\"Architects' Congress.\\" The Charter had a significant impact on urban planning after World War II. Background Although Le Corbusier had exhibited his ideas for the ideal city, the Ville Contemporaine in the 1920s, during the early 1930s, after contact with international planners he began work on the Ville Radieuse (Radiant City). In 1930 he had become an active member of the syndicalist movement and proposed the Ville Radieuse as a blueprint of social reform. Unlike the radial design of the Ville Contemporaine, the Ville Radieuse was a linear city based upon the abstract shape of the human body with head, spine, arms and legs. The design maintained the idea of high-rise housing blocks, free circulation and abundant green spaces proposed in his earlier work. Le Corbusier exhibited the first representations of his ideas at the third CIAM meeting in Brussels in 1930 and published a book of the same title as the city in 1935. The Functional City The concept of the Functional City came to dominate CIAM thinking after the conference in Brussels. At a meeting in Z√ºrich in 1931, CIAM members Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, Siegfried Giedion, Rudolf Steiger and Werner M. Moser discussed with Cornelis van Eesteren the importance of solar orientation in governing the directional positioning of low-cost housing on a given site. Van Eesteren had been chief architect of Amsterdam's Urban Development Section since 1929 and the group asked him to prepare a number of analytical studies of cities ready for the next main CIAM meeting planned to be in Moscow in 1933. The theme for these studies would be the Functional City, that is, one where land planning would be based upon function-based zones. Van Eesteren employed the city planner Theodor Karel van Lohuizen to use methods developed for the Amsterdam Expansion Plan, to prepare zoning plans that would predict overall future development in the city. He relied upon the more rational methods being promoted by CIAM at that time which sought to use statistical information for designing zone uses rather than designing them in any detail. At a special congress meeting in Berlin later in 1931 van Eesteren presented his findings to his colleagues. He presented three drawings of Amsterdam. The first at a scale of 1:10000 showed land use and density, the second showed transportation networks and the third, at 1:50000 showed the regional setting of the city. He also presented supporting information on the four functions of dwelling, work, recreation and transport. Based upon his presentation it was decided that the separate national groups within CIAM would prepare similar presentation boards for the Moscow meeting. A standard set of notation was agreed. In 1932 Le Corbusier's Palace of the Soviets competition entry failed to gain acceptance from the jury and, due to the political conditions in Russia, CIAM's agenda became increasingly ignored. A new venue for the fourth CIAM conference was required. CIAM 4 The fourth CIAM conference took place on board the S.S. Patris, an ocean-going liner journeying from Marseilles to Athens in July 1933. The national groups reported to the conference with the findings from their city studies, presenting in each case the agreed three boards showing a total of 34 cities. In addition, Le Corbusier and the group who had met earlier in Z√ºrich hosted a meeting to state the core goals of the Functional City. On arrival in Athens on 3 August an exhibition of the Functional City boards was held at the National Technical University of Athens and inaugurated by Greece's prime minister. The boards were separated into seven categories: metropolises, cities of administration, ports, industrial cities, pleasure cities and cities of diverse function. The delegates remained in Athens for a number of days, some visited local classical sites and others visited nearby islands. On 10 August they embarked on the return journey to Marseilles. During meetings on the return journey delegates found it impossible to agree on resolutions for the Functional City. Van Eesteren's original Amsterdam plan had, with greater resources, a basis formed by scientific data. The plans presented by the national groups did not have this and, despite Giedion's insistence, delegates were reluctant to agree on guidelines. Eventually, two groups agreed on two separate texts: observations and resolutions. The Athens Charter Highpoint 1 by Berthold Lubetkin The observations taken from the studies of 33 cities set guidelines under the titles: living, working, recreation and circulation. > CIAM demanded that housing districts should occupy the best sites, and a > minimum amount of solar exposure should be required in all dwellings. For > hygienic reasons, buildings should not be built along transportation routes, > and modern techniques should be used to construct high apartment building > spaces widely apart, to free the soil for large green parks. -Mumford, 2000, > The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928-1960, The MIT Press, p85 Additionally they said it was important to reduce commuting times by locating industrial zones close to residential ones and buffering them with wide parks and sports areas. Street widths and requirements should be scientifically worked out to accommodate the speed and type of transport. Finally, with regards to conservation, historic monuments should be kept only when they were of true value and their conservation did not reduce their inhabitants to unhealthy living conditions. The observations formed the basis of Josep Llu√≠s Sert's book Can our cities survive? and were incorporated in Le Corbusier's Athens Charter published in 1943. The resolutions formed part of Le Corbusier's book The Radiant City published in 1935. The text of the Athens Charter as published became an extension of the content of The Radiant City and Le Corbusier significantly re-worded the original observations. As well as adding new material he also removed the urban plans upon which the original text was based. This treatment made the Athens Charter an abstract text of general value but also transformed the original force of the observations that were founded before on concrete references. Despite its title, the Athens Charter cannot be considered as the mutual outcome of the CIAM conference, which took place ten years earlier, but largely as an expression of Le Courbusier's individual concerns. Pre-war influence Van Nelle Factory, Netherlands The CIAM 4 meeting was influential among attending architects from Switzerland, France, England, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Greece, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Brazil and Canada. After The Radiant City was published in France in 1935, Le Corbusier continued to develop his ideas of urban planning through a number of unrealised schemes. These included plans for Antwerp, Paris, Moscow, Algiers and Morocco. In the Netherlands, CIAM delegates visited the Van Nelle factory designed in part by Mart Stam that was to have formed a larger part of a Functional City design. CIAM 4 was the first congress that the influential MARS Group from England was represented. In 1935 MARS member Berthold Lubetkin and his practice, the Tecton Group completed Highpoint in Highgate, London. The project comprised 56 dwellings grouped together as two crosses on plan, eight dwellings per arm. Each dwelling is linked to a central service core but is separated from its neighbour by a balcony - a design feature that virtually eliminated noise transfer between dwellings. In 1937 with the fall of the Second Spanish Republic, Sert suggested that England and the United States may be the best place to focus CIAM's activities. Post-war influence The Athens Charter had a huge impact on planning thought after World War II. However, its influence was more complicated because in the 1950s CIAM attempted to replace the Functional City described in the Charter with a different Charter of Habitat. =France= The Unit√© d'Habitation in Marseille In 1946 Le Corbusier received a commission for projects in La Rochelle and St Di√©. The urban plan allowed him to experiment with urban monumentality that had been somewhat underplayed in the Charter, but as part of the project he proposed eight Unit√© d'Habitation flanked by a civic centre. Although these proposals were unbuilt, he had more success in Marseilles where an initial study for three Unit√©s resulted in one being built. In line with the Charter, the Unit√© was a north-south orientated block eighteen storeys high set in parkland. There is a public 'street' on levels 7 and 8 that provides various shops, offices and a hotel. On the roof there is a nursery school, a running track and a pool. It opened in 1952 but had begun to influence architects even before it was complete. =United Kingdom= High rises part of the Alton Estate Parkhill Estate, Sheffield The 1949 Housing Act in England paved the way for Local Authorities to provide a balance of housing types for a range of communities, not just the working class. In the socialist post war atmosphere, architectural writer J M Richards praised Le Corbusier's Unit√© for \\"putting clean and healthy housing in a parkland setting\\". Between 1952 and 1958 London County Council built the Alton East and Alton West high- rise blocks in Roehampton. Alton East comprised 744 dwellings within mainly 10 storey blocks and Alton West was 1867 dwellings in 5, 6 and 12 storey blocks. Both projects are set within parkland and have since been listed. In Sheffield in 1958, the city architect, Lewis Womersley, designed the Park Hill Estate. The product of an entire slum clearance, three times the size of the Unit√©, dwellings were housed in a series of high rise structures connected by external decks. These 'streets in the air' are wide enough to incorporate bicycles and milk floats. Initial success came because whole streets were moved into adjacent dwellings on the new scheme. Harold Macmillan said it would \\"draw the admiration of the world\\". In Scotland, the Department of Housing for Scotland encouraged Local Authorities to build more unified and open schemes. The Functional City prescribed the separation of industrial zones from residential ones by parkland. This concept suited the regeneration of industrial decay in Scottish cities. From 1956 the Hutchesontown Gorbals area of Glasgow was redeveloped. The architect Robert Matthew designed one of the four areas using 18 storey blocks on a north-south axis that ignored local street patterns. The Golden Lane London, was designed by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon, who also designed the [Barbican], adjacent. It has a variety of dwellings and a good provision of supporting community buildings. Like the Unit√© it has a terrace on the roof. The Smithsons (Alison and Peter Smithson) were against the four functions explored for the Functional City, renaming them House, Street, District and City. In the Golden Lane development the House became the family unit, the Street was an elevated access deck but the District and City lay outside the project's boundaries. Their work was never built at Golden Lane, but these ideas can be viewed in their book \\"Urban Structuring\\". =The Americas= Ministers Esplanade in Bras√≠lia L√∫cio Costa's conception of the plan for Bras√≠lia saw the city as a manifestation of the Functional City. Like Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse, it was seen as a method of imposing order, progress and stability to Brazil's new capital. Like Le Corbusier, Costa and Oscar Niemeyer aspired to produce a city based upon equality and justice. In a variation of the Functional City, Sert designed married-student housing for Harvard University in 1964. Known as Peabody Terraces it was made up of three main towers set in lawns and sheltered pedestrian routes. It avoided the usual vacuum at the base by grading the scale between the towers and the lawns. =The rest of the world= In Japan in 1957, Kunio Maekawa designed the Harumi Apartment block in Tokyo based upon the idea of the Unit√©. Meanwhile, In Tel Aviv in 1963 CIAM member Jacob B. Bakema designed a Functional City proposal based upon Le Corbusier's Algiers scheme. Criticism Pruitt‚ÄìIgoe housing scheme in St Louis, Missouri The Pruitt‚ÄìIgoe housing scheme in St Louis, Missouri was designed in accordance with CIAM ideals for the Functional City. It was made up of 14 storey blocks and is often claimed to have won an American Institute of Architects award when it was built in 1951, but no evidence of such exists. Charles Jencks proclaimed that the death of Modern Architecture was on 15 July 1972 at 3.32pm when the Pruitt‚ÄìIgoe housing scheme was demolished with dynamite. Architectural critic Reyner Banham was concerned that the supposed universality of the Charter concealed a very narrow view of architecture and planning that overly constrained the members of CIAM. The emphasis on tall high-density housing amongst wide, green spaces effectively killed research into other areas of urban housing. In planning terms the Charter had set rigid geometries for urban planning, increasingly there became an awareness of words like 'neighbourhood', 'cluster' and 'association' that demanded a more organic approach to the image of the city. Even by 1954 during the Aix-en-Provence meeting of CIAM the younger generation riled against the pre-war utopian ideals that the Charter represented. This disillusionment would lead to the formation of Team X at the Dubrovnik meeting of CIAM that would eventually lead to the breakup of the Conference as an organisation. In the case of Bras√≠lia, whilst Niemeyer remained faithful to the ideas of zoning and green spaces, his revised urban utopia became based upon a smaller city with a high vertical concentration of people with increased pedestrian facilities. In 1958 he had warned that his utopian dream could not be fulfilled unless society itself was reorganised to suit it. At its inauguration the city was branded a Kafkaesque Nightmare with an Orwellian environment. > To reduce the matter to high density when no due attention was given to > communal facilities was to court disaster; to create open space without > greenery was to devalue the idea of the community living in nature. The > imitations of the Unit√© usually involved such drastic omissions. Does this > mean that the prototype should be blamed for the later disastrous > variations? ‚àíCurtis, 1986, Modern Architecture since 1900, Phaidon, p293 Recent history In 2003 the European Council of Spatial Planners wrote a new version of the Charter. Trivia J. G. Ballard's book High Rise is set in a 40 storey block set in parkland with other high-rises in central London. On the tenth floor is a wide concourse with supermarket, shops and gymnasium and a swimming pool. On the 35th floor there is a smaller swimming pool, a sauna and a restaurant. As the affluent tenants embark upon an orgy of destruction, Ballard tells the story of how the whole block slowly degenerates into chaos.

Alabama * Perdido County, Alabama would contain northern Baldwin County, divided by a straight line extending westward from the northwestern tip of Florida, and western Escambia County, west of Big Escambia Creek. (The Flomaton area is excluded via a prominent power line easement, from Big Escambia Creek to the Florida state line.) The southwestern tip of Conecuh County, also west of Big Escambia Creek, may be included as well. The headwaters of the Perdido River rise near the center of this proposed county. The Perdido County seat would be Atmore. The county has been proposed by city of Atmore backers, who believe that their growing city of over 10,000 residents should be a county seat. Furthermore, county backers believe that Atmore belongs in the Mobile-Daphne-Fairhope metropolitan combined statistical area, which would become much more likely within its own exurban-leaning county. Brewton would remain the county seat of rural-leaning Escambia County. In addition to the incorporated city of Atmore, Perdido County would include the unincorporated communities of Blacksher, Canoe, Freemanville, Huxford, Nokomis, Perdido and Tensaw. Alaska * Chugiak and Eagle River are communities along the Glenn Highway between Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. Originally farming and homesteading communities with a distinct identity, they became better known starting in the 1970s as bedroom communities of Anchorage, and are currently located within its city limits (see below). In the wake of the incorporation of the Greater Anchorage Area Borough (in 1964) and subsequent efforts to merge the GAAB with Anchorage's city government (which began in 1966), Chugiak and Eagle River residents began their own efforts to attempt to secede from the GAAB. The culmination of these efforts, the Chugiak-Eagle River Borough, incorporated on August 27, 1974 with an area of and an estimated population of 5,832, before the incorporation was invalidated by the Alaska Supreme Court on April 14, 1975. Five months later, the reconstituted GAAB and existing cities within its boundaries merged to form the Municipality of Anchorage. The population of Eagle River increased greatly during the 1980s and 1990s. This has led to renewed discussion during the 21st century on the part of Chugiak and Eagle River residents to secede from Anchorage. Arizona *Russell Pearce, a state legislator, has proposed a bill which would ease county splits, as part of his effort to split off the East Valley portion of Maricopa County. Two such attempts were made: the first one in the early 1990s included the cities and towns of Mesa (county seat), Chandler, Gilbert, Queen Creek, Tempe, and Guadalupe, while a second attempt in the early 2000s included the same cities and towns except for Tempe and Guadalupe. County splitting rules were made more restrictive after the formation of La Paz County in 1983, which required a significant state investment to keep the county running as the result of its small tax base. *There is an ongoing movement in Lake Havasu City to split from Mohave County. *In the late 1930s, differences between mining and ranching interests in Cochise County spurred a proposal to split the county, with the new county's seat at Willcox, which the state Legislature ultimately rejected. *In the 1980s, a bill was passed in the state legislature to create an all Indian county out of the northern halves of Navajo and Apache Counties, and the northeastern half of Coconino County. Non-Indian communities in the southern region of these counties felt that the Navajo and Hopi Nations do not pay a fair share in local taxes. The bill was vetoed by then governor Bruce Babbitt, who placed a five-year moratorium on its consideration.

Proposed by late state senator Pete Knight (cf.) in 2002.1998 Significant Legislation *A writer to the Los Angeles Times in 1997 indicated a sentiment from south Orange County residents that they would seek to secede from the county if it insisted on building a new airport on the former site of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. The airport plan was eventually discarded in favor of the Orange County Great Park plan. *Prior to the formation of Orange County, residents of Anaheim in 1870 pushed a bill in the state assembly for the creation of an Anaheim County. The proposal had the support of San Francisco. *In 1988, there was a serious effort, including a vote on the subject, to divide San Bernardino County into its urban southwestern corner, which would have retained the name, and a new Mojave County to comprise the vast, sparsely populated northern and eastern portions. Florida *Two attempts to form a separate county combining parts of Levy and Marion Counties took place. The first one was Bloxham County, and the second was Call County. *In 1960, Miami Beach and other municipalities along the Atlantic coast, unhappy with the government structure introduced by the 1957 adoption of a charter in Dade County, unsuccessfully sought to break away as a separate county. In 1999, a bill was introduced in the Florida Legislature that would have allowed the City of Hialeah to vote on seceding from Miami-Dade County to form a new county. *In the early-1990s, members of the coastal communities of Duval County that rejected consolidation with Jacksonville planned to form Ocean County. *Due to major differences between the south end of the county (the tourist heavy side including the first and third largest communities in the county, Navarre and Gulf Breeze) and the north end (the more agriculture-based side, but where the political power is concentrated), some individuals have suggested that the south end of Santa Rosa County should break off as its own. However, while this has been suggested by some, no major or organized effort has been made to enact such actions. Names like Fairpoint County (after the peninsula the county would be focused upon) and Reagan County (for President Reagan) have been proposed, but no name has been really pushed as part of these suggestions. Hawaii *In 2006, residents of unincorporated west Hawaii County, which currently encompasses all of Hawaii Island, met to propose the formation of West Hawaii County. The recent movement reportedly has the support of at least one state senator. Illinois *Lincoln County: Southern Cook County communities, upset at Chicago-centric policies of the county government, petitioned in 2004 to split off the southern portion of the county. The southern communities argue they are in financial ruin due to bad policies limiting their ability to attract business, but critics contend that the area's problems stem from rampant city corruption. *Marquette County: proposed county to be formed from Hancock County, which made progress in the state legislature in 1844.Glen M. Leonard, Nauvoo: A Place of Peace, A People of Promise (Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 2002), p. 308 Kansas *Garfield County: in 1887, the area around Ravanna and Eminence split from Buffalo County (now split among Lane, Finney, and Gray counties) and organized into Garfield County. Both towns were of equal influence, and contested the award of county seat. An election that year, which involved 20 Dodge City deputies including Bat Masterson, found Ravanna to have the lead. However, Eminence discovered that illegal votes had been cast for Ravanna, and in 1889 the state supreme court overturned 60 votes, awarding Garfield County seat to Eminence. In a doomsday move, Ravanna countered by hiring surveyors to determine that the new county's land area was under the minimum allowed at the time. In 1893 the Kansas state legislature invalidated the county and annexed it to Finney. Today, both Ravanna and Eminence are ghost towns.1998 Kansas Profiles Garfield County ‚Äì KS-Cyclopedia ‚Äì 1912 Buffalo County ‚Äì KS-Cyclopedia ‚Äì 1912 Massachusetts *Throughout the history of Worcester County, the largest by area in the state, residents of the northern part of the county have pushed for a split. This never occurred, and is now a moot point, as in Massachusetts and Connecticut, county governments in those states have been dissolved, with responsibilities assumed by the state and municipalities within those counties, which now exist solely for historical and regional demarcation purposes.  Michigan  * DeTour County, to be formed from portions of Chippewa and Mackinac counties, including Drummond Island. * Lac Vieux Desert County, to be formed from portions of Gogebic, Iron and Ontonagon counties. * Washington County, to be formed from western Marquette County. Minnesota *Residents of Florence Township began a petition to secede from Goodhue County over plans to locate a nuclear waste disposal site in the area. *There appears to have been a proposal to split Pine County in 2000, which prompted a change in county formation laws. Nevada *Residents of Nye County, mainly in Pahrump and Tonopah, have pushed as recently as 2001 for a north-south county split, perhaps with the northern portion merging with Esmeralda County. While laws making it easier to form new counties have passed since then, this split has not occurred. Nye is the largest county in Nevada and the third largest in the entire U.S., although over 90% is federal land. New Jersey *The municipalities of western Essex County have discussed secession from the county, to create a new West Essex County, spurred mainly by a belief that tax laws benefit the eastern portions of the county at the expense of the western municipalities. Currently, this idea is essentially a dead movement. New York *Adirondack County, to be formed from northern Essex and southern Franklin counties. *Brookhaven County, to be formed from the Town of Brookhaven in central Suffolk County. *Peconic County, to be formed from the rural eastern portion of Suffolk County. North Carolina *Providence County, to be formed from southern Mecklenburg County. *Lake County, to be formed from northern Mecklenburg County. Ohio *In 1818, residents of the Barnesville greater area petitioned the state legislature for a new county seated at the city and formed from parts of Belmont, Guernsey, and Monroe counties. The proposal was rejected. Oregon *In 1984, Wilbur Ternyik promoted an effort to form the new \\"McCall County\\" out of the western portions of Lane County and Douglas County. The effort was stopped by its promoter at the request of the governor. Lane County is the size of Connecticut, or of Delaware and Rhode Island combined; 4,620 square miles.The Register-Guard, June 16, 1984. Siuslaw News June 20, 1984. The Oregonian, June 28, 1984. \\"At the time we were being treated like a bunch of garbage, and we'd had enough of it,\\" said Ternyik in 2005. Though the effort was not successful, Ternyik credited the effort with getting the county to treat their coastal constituents \\"a lot nicer,\\" in part due to nervousness about losing timber revenue. *In 2005, Keith Stanton began a petition to form a new county from the western portion of Lane County, including Eugene. The proposed county was to be named \\"Siuslaw County\\". Stanton's petition was unsuccessful.The Register-Guard, September 30, 2005, full page coverage. Siuslaw News Opinion Page, April 2005 though May 2006. According to Stanton, a new Suislaw County was introduced in the legislature in 1913, at the behest of the timber industry, for reasons similar to those he noted in 2005; and some Mapleton residents revived the idea in 1975, but backed off when the county agreed to improve services. South Carolina *Birch County, to be formed from portions of Lexington and Richland counties in the Midlands region of the state. Proposed in 2013, one-third of voters in the proposed county's area would have to petition the South Carolina Legislature to create a referendum on county creation. Two-thirds of voters in the proposed area would then be required to approve the referendum. Due to South Carolina's checkered voting rights history, the application for a new county would also require federal review and approval. Tennessee *Neshoba County, to be formed from part of Shelby County. Its formation was threatened in 1990 by rural communities after the city of Memphis proposed that the city's financially struggling school district merge with that of the county. The merger actually took place at the start of the 2013‚Äì14 school year, with some of the towns in question forming their own school districts in response. Virginia *Catoctin County, to be formed from western Loudoun County, in response to the voiding of zoning measures intended to slow growth in the area. *During the desegregation era, the town of Ivor threatened to secede from Southampton County after a consolidated and integrated county high school was built in the late 1950s. Washington *Cascade County in the 1880s, from the eastern portions of Whatcom County, Skagit County, and Snohomish County counties, with Sauk City as county seat, in 1964, from eastern portions of King and Snohomish counties in the 1970s, from the rural eastern portions of King and Pierce counties, and in 2016, from the rural northwestern portions of Kittitas County *Cedar County: from eastern King County. A petition in support of the county collected 23,765 signatures, however the Washington Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 1998 that the state government was not obligated to act upon the petition and that the number of signatures was insufficient per the Washington State Constitution. It said that signatures from half the registered voters of the affected area are required to propose a new county, shelving many county secession movements in the state. Prior to the ruling, Washington county secession movements had interpreted the law to require signatures from only half of those who voted in the most recent election. *Freedom County: from northern Snohomish County. Claiming frustration at what they believed to be a corrupt Snohomish County government, on April 23, 1995, the Freedom County commissioners submitted to the Washington Secretary of State a petition with 12,679 signatures calling for the secession of the northern half of Snohomish County, excluding Marysville and the Tulalip Indian reservation. The 1998 decision against the proposed Cedar County was described as a \\"major setback\\" for this proposal as well. *Independence County: from the eastern portion of Whatcom County. Both Pioneer and Independence movements cite poor services and oppressive property regulations, plus favoritism towards Bellingham as reasons for their proposals. Both are rumored to be backed by land developers. *Olympic County: from western Clallam and Jefferson counties *Pioneer County: from northern Whatcom County. The 1998 decision against the proposed Cedar County was described as a \\"major setback\\" for this proposal as well. *Puget Sound County: from southern King County; proposed in 1996 *Skykomish County: from southeastern Snohomish and northeastern King counties. The 1998 decision against the proposed Cedar County was described as a \\"major setback\\" for this proposal as well. *Whitehorse County: from northern Snohomish County in the 1970s Wyoming *Wind River County, to be formed from eastern Fremont County, with county seat at Riverton. Riverton and Lander, which as county seat would remain in Fremont County, are rival towns. *Residents of Wright proposed a split from Campbell County in 2005. *In 2004, state senator Stan Cooper introduced a bill to form Fossil County from the southern half of Lincoln County, which failed.

The Bush‚ÄìBlair 2003 Iraq memo or Manning memo is a secret memo of a two- hour meeting between American President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair that took place on 31 January 2003 at the White House. It purportedly shows that at that point the Bush administration had already decided on the invasion of Iraq. The memo was written by Blair's chief foreign policy adviser at the time David Manning, who participated in the meeting. It has become controversial for its content, which includes discussing ways to provoke Saddam Hussein into a confrontation, with Bush floating the idea of painting a U-2 spyplane in United Nations colors and letting it fly low over Iraq to provoke Iraq into shooting it down, thus providing a pretext for the subsequent invasion. It also shows Bush and Blair making a secret deal to carry out the invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass destruction were discovered by UN weapons inspectors, in direct contradiction to statements made by Blair to British Parliament afterwards that Saddam would be given a final chance to disarm. According to the memo, Bush is paraphrased as saying: Bush also said to Blair that he \\"thought it unlikely that there would be internecine warfare between the different religious and ethnic groups\\" in Iraq after the war. Five pages long, and classified as extremely sensitive, the existence of the memo was first alleged by Philippe Sands in his book Lawless World (2005). It was then obtained by American newspaper The New York Times, which confirmed its authenticity. UK Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said, with regard to the memo: \\"If these allegations are accurate, the Prime Minister and President Bush were determined to go to war with or without a second UN resolution, and Britain was signed up to do so by the end of January 2003.\\" See also *Bush-Aznar memo *Casus belli *Downing Street memo *Iraq document leak 18 September 2004 *September Dossier *Iraq Dossier *Butler Review *Iraq Inquiry *Yellowcake forgery *Plame affair *Propaganda *Dr. David Kelly *Operation Rockingham *Hussein Kamel al-Majid and his Testimony for UNSCOM 8-22-1995. *Iraqi aluminum tubes *Project for the New American Century *Wolfowitz Doctrine *Bush Doctrine *Scott Ritter ReferencesExternal links *The White House meeting that took us to war By Oliver King, Guardian Unlimited, February 2, 2006 *Blair-Bush deal before Iraq war revealed in secret memo by Richard Norton-Taylor, The Guardian, February 3, 2006 *Bush 'tried to lure Saddam into war using UN aircraft' by Rosemary Bennett and Michael Evans, The Times, February 3, 2006 *Fresh claims about the build-up to Iraq war by BBC World Service, February 3, 2006 *Bush Was Set on Path to War, Memo by British Adviser Says by Don Van Natta Jr., New York Times, March 27, 2006 Category:Political scandals in the United Kingdom Category:Causes and prelude of the Iraq War Category:George W.

Raskol is a Tok Pisin (Pidgin English) word derived from the English word rascal and is currently used in PNG to refer to gang members or criminals in general. History Raskol gangs first emerged in Port Moresby in the 1970s, largely associated with the growth of urban squatter settlements in Port Moresby that consisted of recent migrants from the rural areas of the country and their children. Unemployment was (and remains) high in the settlements, with most employment in the informal sector, and educational opportunities very limited. Similar to criminal gangs in western urban centres such as Los Angeles, London, and Paris, criminal gangs emerged as a mechanism through which uneducated and unemployed urban youth in PNG sought a sense of self-worth and security by associating with others who share their deprivation. In a country where betel nut, marijuana, and other psychoactive recreational drugs are widely accessible at an early age, these drugs are an often-cited contributor to the erratic behaviour of raskol gangs. Widespread alcoholism due to cultural attitudes towards alcoholism may also be a contributor.Agarwhal, Darham P., Racial/Ethnic and Gender Differences in Alcohol Use and Misuse Many PNG criminal law enforcement officials accept drunkenness as a legal defence in domestic violence cases.Constitutional and Law Reform Commission of Papua New Guinea Report on Domestic Violence , Papua New Guinea Law Reform Commission, 1992. Over the years, raskol gang activities have evolved from opportunistic incidents of small scale theft or breaking and entering to more organised criminal activity including serving as middlemen in the marijuana trade both within PNG and between PNG and Australia, as well as becoming increasingly politicised as the instrument of various political powers. The growth of squatter settlements in Lae and Port Moresby has led to a corresponding increase in the number and size of raskol gangs. Crimes such as rape, murder, and carjacking are common in a city that has a 60 percent unemployment rate. The raskol culture of violent crime has recently spread to other populous and impoverished coastal areas of New Guinea, including Lae, Wewak, New Britain (particularly Rabaul), Bougainville Island, and Manus Island. In these areas, the raskol culture has merged with the local history of cannibalism, marijuana cultivation and usage, tribal feuds, canoe warfare, and piracy. Hijacking of boats and even kidnapping or murder of the owners is becoming more common. Even the Papua New Guinean captains of small supply boats that frequent small island villages run the risk of being beaten, robbed, or murdered for the sake of their meagre cargo of instant noodles, clothing, and disposable batteries. Rape In urban areas, particularly slum areas, Raskol gangs often require raping women for initiation reasons. Peter Moses, one of the leaders of the \\"Dirty Dons 585\\" Raskol gang, stated that raping women was a ‚Äúmust‚Äù for the young members of the gang. In rural areas, when a boy wants to become a man, he may go to an enemy village and kill a pig to be accepted as an adult, while in the cities \\"women have replaced pigs.\\" Moses, who claimed to have raped more than 30 women himself, said, ‚ÄúAnd it is better if a boy kills her afterwards, there will be less problems with the police.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Portraits of Violence: The Gangs of Port Moresby, a photo gallery by Stephen Dupont and Kristen Ashburn.

It is a satire of manners and suburbia, and a comment on emotional alienation with echoes of the works of Franz Kafka. Earl Keese‚Äôs character and situation begin realistically but become increasingly fantastic. Keese is an Everyman whose life is swiftly turned upside down. As he scrambles to reclaim his sense of normalcy and dignity, he comes to think that everyone, including his family, is against him.  Plot summary  Earl Keese is a middle-aged, middle-class suburbanite with a wife, Enid, and teenage daughter, Elaine. Earl is content with his dull, unexceptional life, but this changes when a younger, less sophisticated couple, Harry and Ramona, move in next door. Harry is physically intimidating and vulgar; Ramona is sexually aggressive, and both impose themselves on the Keese household. Their free-spirited personalities and overbearing and boorish behavior endear them to Enid and Elaine, but Earl fears that he is losing control of his life and his family. Over the course of one night, the antagonism between Earl and his new neighbors escalates into suburban warfare. Critical reception Kirkus Reviews wrote that Neighbors was \\"one weird book . . . a savage send-up of common courtesies. A fantasia on middle-class paranoia. And, perhaps above all, a lesson in how a comic master can make the same joke over and over (here, the explosions of aggression) and get a big laugh every time. Even without much shaping or sense of paceit's more a long skit than a well-made novela harrowing and hilarious triumph.\\" In an article published after Berger's death, in 2014, the Los Angeles Review of Books called Neighbors \\"a book such as Kafka might have written had he lived in an American suburb and had a much stronger sense of humor.\\"  Analysis  Berger's off-kilter tone blurs the line between paranoia and reality, defense and offense, action and intention, ally and adversary. Harry and Ramona seem to constantly undergo changes in their respective personalities and Enid and Elaine appear to choose sides against Earl at random, but Berger also implies that it is Earl‚Äôs sense of reality that is skewed and deluded. Earl is frustrated because he can never prove that Harry and Ramona are doing anything wrong on purpose, and the more he attempts to expose them, the more ridiculous he makes himself. Yet Earl comes to realize that Harry and Ramona have served as the crucible of his redemption: being forced out of his comfort zone of complacency and habit has provided him with an excitement he has never known before. As Earl comes to recognize value in his neighbors, he realizes that his wife is a distrustful alcoholic, his daughter is an underachiever and petty thief, and that his new neighbors can provide him with an escape from his existence of insignificance and emotional impotence. From a nightmare comes hope and a strengthened resolve to survive. In his study of Berger, writer Stanley Trachtenberg describes Neighbors as an existentialist parable in which \\"the loss of coherence between various aspects of self comically fragments the notion of identity and thus fictionalizes the existential concept of authenticity as a shaping condition of it.\\" In a 1980 newspaper interview, Berger said of Neighbors, \\"As my 10th novel, begun at the close of my 20th year as a published novelist, it is appropriately a bizarre celebration of whatever gift I have, the strangest of all my narratives . . . the morality of this work, like that of all my other volumes, will be in doubt until the end of the narrative ‚Äì and perhaps to the end of eternity, now that I think about it.\\"  Characters  *Earl Keese *Enid Keese *Elaine Keese *Harry *Ramona  Adaptations  A film version was released in 1981, starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd.

It was first presented to the public at the 1963 Turin Auto Show. Development Rear three-quarter view The design and development of the 350 GTV was overseen by Lamborghini chief engineer Gianpaolo Dallara, assistant Paolo Stanzani and test driver Bob Wallace, the core engineering team that developed many early Lamborghini cars. Giotto Bizzarrini was commissioned to design the engine and an early version of the chassis. The 350 GTV's name signified the 3.5 L displacement of the engine, the \\"GT\\" for grand tourer and the \\"V\\" for the Italian word \\"Veloce\\" (meaning \\"fast\\"). The 350 GTV body was designed by Franco Scaglione and built by Carrozzeria Sargiotto in Turin. Ferruccio Lamborghini's opinion had a significant amount of influence on the design. He reportedly requested styling echoing the Aston Martin DB4's tapering rear bodywork and the sleek front of the Jaguar E-type. The 350 GTV had many styling details that were unusual at the time of its introduction, including hidden headlamps and six exhaust tailpipes (three on each side of the car's rear). The body was constructed of aluminum and steel. As workers at Sargiotto were primarily skilled in building molds for plastic products, the 350 GTV's body had numerous fit and finish issues. Initially, Bizzarrini designed a racing-style tubular spaceframe chassis for the 350 GTV. Giorgio Neri and Luciano Bonacini built the tube frame chassis in Modena. This design was later reworked by Dallara into a more conventional, heavier design constructed of mostly square and rectangular section tubing that would be used in the production 350 GT. Ferruccio Lamborghini commissioned Giotto Bizzarrini to develop the 350 GTV engine. This was the first iteration of the Lamborghini V12 series of engines, which would power future Lamborghini models up through the end of Murci√©lago production in 2010. Bizzarrini developed a 3.5 litre racing-specification V12 engine, with an output of at 8,000 rpm, and torque of , using the DIN measurement standard. This design was derived from Bizzarrini's plan for a 1.5 litre Formula One racing engine. Top speed was claimed by the factory to be , although this was an estimate as the car was never driven or tested by the factory. This engine had a compression ratio of 9.5:1 and relatively aggressive valve timing compared to later versions of the Lamborghini V12. The higher redline, compression ratio and timing made the 350 GTV's engine more suitable for competition use rather than as a comfortable road car. The 350 GTV engine was also equipped with six downdraft Weber carburetors and a dry sump lubrication system. The transmission was a 5 speed manual made by ZF. Power was directed to the rear wheels via a Salisbury self-locking differential. The independent suspension used triangular wishbones on the front and trapezoidal wishbones on the rear, with telescopic shock absorbers and coil springs at all four corners. Servo-controlled disc brakes were equipped on all four wheels. The Borrani center locking wire wheels were fitted with Pirelli Cinturato HS tires. 350 GTV Interior The 350 GTV was never a complete, driveable car during its time as a Lamborghini prototype. During assembly, the workforce discovered that the body panels would not fit around the engine. Since he had no further plans for the 350 GTV beyond being a show car, Mr. Lamborghini had the engine bay ballasted with bricks and kept the bonnet shut throughout the Turin Auto Show. The incomplete show car also lacked brake calipers, foot pedals and windshield wipers.  Introduction and influence  Ferruccio Lamborghini (center, with hand outstretched) discussing the newly-introduced 350 GTV with journalist Giovanni Canestrini The 350 GTV was introduced to the public at the 1963 Turin Auto Show. It was covered extensively by the press and received both positive and negative reactions. A sales brochure was produced and Ferruccio Lamborghini used the unveiling of this prototype to cultivate interest in a production version. At the time of the 350 GTV's introduction, Mr. Lamborghini told Road & Track magazine of his intention to make both touring and competition versions of the 350 GTV, although no competition version was ever realized. Lamborghini later garnered a reputation for being reluctant to build racing versions of his cars. Ferruccio Lamborghini was dissatisfied with several design features of the 350 GTV, and with the state of tune of the engine. He commissioned Carrozzeria Touring to redesign the car to be more practical and had the engine detuned to at 6,500 rpm for use in the production car. The compression ratio and redline were lowered and the camshaft profiles altered to moderate the valve timing. The racing-derived dry sump lubrication and downdraft carburetors were also replaced with a simpler wet sump system and a more common model of Weber sidedraft carburetors. The new body and retuned engine resulted in the first production Lamborghini, the 350 GT.  Later history  After the 1963 Turin Auto Show, the 350 GTV was placed into storage at the Lamborghini factory. The 350 GTV remained in storage until the mid-1980s, when car dealer Romano Bernardoni and his cousin, Lamborghini expert Stefano Pasini, convinced the management to sell the 350 GTV to them. Bernardoni and Pasini did not receive the gauges and steering wheel with the car. They did, however, receive several proposals to modify the car into running condition and accepted one. During the modification process, the car's colour was changed from its original pale blue to deep metallic green at the owner's request. The 350 GTV was then sold to a Japanese collector, who placed the car in the Noritake Collection. Several years later, the 350 GTV was placed on display at the Lamborghini Museum in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy.

The UN claims that acts of espionage on it are illegal under a number of international treaties, including the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the 1947 agreement between the United Nations and the United States, and the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. In one notable incident, the US and other Western countries were found to be spying on the UN in March 2003, in the run-up to the Iraq War, and actual bugging devices were found inside the UN.Bugging device found at UN offices, Brian Whitaker, 18 December 2004, The Guardian In 2010, WikiLeaks revealed that US diplomats had been spying on UN leaders. On 25 August 2013, Der Spiegel revealed US National Security Agency secretly monitored the U.N.'s internal video conferencing system by decrypting during 2012. Spying by individual states=United States= The British newspaper The Observer published an investigative report revealing that the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States was conducting a secret surveillance operation directed at intercepting the telephone and email communications of several U.N. Security Council diplomats, both in their offices and in their homes. This campaign, the result of a directive by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, was aimed primarily at the delegations from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea and Pakistan. The investigative report cited an NSA memo which advised senior agency officials that it was \\"'mounting a surge' aimed at gleaning information not only on how delegations on the Security Council will vote on any second resolution on Iraq, but also 'policies', 'negotiating positions', 'alliances' and 'dependencies' ‚Äì the 'whole gamut of information that could give US policymakers an edge in obtaining results favourable to US goals or to head off surprises'. The authenticity of this memo has been called into question by many in the US and it is still unclear as to whether or not it is legitimate. A young translator for Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), Katharine Gun, leaked the memo to the Observer because she believed the war was illegal. She was fired from her job at GCHQ. Gun was arrested and accused of violating the Official Secrets Act 1989, but charges were dropped after the prosecution presented no evidence.GCHQ translator cleared over leak, BBC News (26 February 2004.David Smith, Hollywood beckons for whistleblower who risked jail over Iraq 'dirty tricks', The Guardian (30 January 2016). In a 2009 confidential cable released by WikiLeaks the following year, US diplomats were directed to spy on UN leaders, including Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, as well as the Security Council delegations of Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom. According to documents leaked by Edward Snowden the NSA successfully cracked the encryption guarding the United Nations' internal videoconferencing system in the summer of 2012. =United Kingdom= Clare Short, a British cabinet minister who resigned in May 2003 over the war, stated in media interviews that British intelligence regularly spied on UN officials. She stated that she had read transcripts of Kofi Annan's conversations. On 26 February 2004 Short alleged on the BBC Today radio programme that British spies regularly intercept UN communications, including those of Kofi Annan, its Secretary-General. The revelation came the day after the unexplained dropping of whistleblowing charges against former GCHQ translator Katharine Gun. Reacting to Short's statement, Tony Blair said \\"I really do regard what Clare Short has said this morning as totally irresponsible, and entirely consistent [with Short's character].\\" Blair also claimed that Short had put UK security, particularly the security of its spies, at risk. The same day, on the BBC's Newsnight programme, Short called Blair's response \\"pompous\\" and said that Britain had no need to spy on Kofi Annan. Blair did not explicitly deny the claims but Robin Cook, former Foreign Secretary, wrote that in his experience he would be surprised if the claims were true. A few days later (on 29 February 2004) Ms Short appeared on ITV's Jonathan Dimbleby programme. She revealed that she had been written to by Britain's senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Andrew Turnbull. Turnbull's confidential letter (which Short showed to Dimbleby, and which was quoted on the programme) formally admonished her for discussing intelligence matters in the media, and threatened \\"further action\\" if she did not desist from giving interviews on the issue. Turnbull wrote that she had made claims \\"which damage the interests of the United Kingdom\\", and that he was \\"extremely disappointed\\". The \\"further action\\" referred to in the letter has been interpreted as threatening either the removal of Short's status as a Privy Counsellor or to legal action under the Official Secrets Act. Either course of action would be without recent precedent; the last time a Privy Counsellor's status was revoked was in 1921 when Sir Edgar Speyer was accused of collaborating with the Germans during the First World War. However, on 1 March 2004, Tony Blair's official spokesman refused to rule out such a step. However, in the same interview on the Jonathan Dimbleby programme, Short backtracked on her claim about British agents bugging Mr Annan. She admitted that the transcripts she saw of Mr Annan's private conversations might have related to Africa and not to Iraq. Asked whether she could confirm that the transcripts related to Iraq, she said: \\"I can't, but there might well have been ... I cannot remember a specific transcript in relation, it doesn't mean it wasn't there.\\" Short also admitted that her original claim, on the Today programme, that Britain had eavesdropped on Mr Annan may have been inaccurate. Asked whether the material could have passed to the British by the Americans, she said: \\"It could. But it normally indicates that. But I can't remember that.\\" =Australia= Australia reportedly received transcripts from the US and British phone-tapping operations against UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and another top UN figure, Hans Blix via phone-tapping. Australia also allegedly assisted the bugging with spy satellites connected to the Pine Gap relay centre near Alice Springs. =Israel= British writer Gordon Thomas alleges that Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service, sees penetrating all UN diplomatic missions as a task of its New York katsa.Thomas, Gordon: Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad (1999, 2009 updated version) General Alain Pellegrini, former commander of UNIFIL, the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, claimed that Israel regularly spies on the peacekeeping mission. According to Pellegrini, Israeli agents had access to all reports and information submitted by UNIFIL to the UN, and is either obtained by wiretapping or is stolen when it reaches New York. Pellegrini claimed that Israeli intelligence even accessed his encrypted semi-annual reports to the UN. =Cyprus= Cypriot intelligence is alleged to have stolen 6,500 UN documents containing sensitive information on its negotiations with Turkish Cypriot leaders. An internal UN investigation reportedly concluded that the theft was the work of the Cyprus Intelligence Service (CIS). The operation was reportedly headed by a CIS agent who befriended Sonja Bachmann, a senior aide to Alexander Downer, an Australian politician who served as an adviser to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the special rapporteur on the Cyprus negotiations. The agent allegedly obtained Bachmann's email login information, allowing a CIS team to access Downer's email several times while he was away on UN business. Subsequently, stolen documents were leaked to the press, and the UN investigation concluded that the Cypriots leaked the documents in the hope of undermining the role of Downer, who was seen as being too closely aligned to Turkish Cypriots. =Morocco= In a 28-page report to the UN Security Council on the situation in Western Sahara and on the situation faced by MINURSO, the UN monitoring force in the region, Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon wrote that Moroccan intelligence was intercepting MINURSO communications.

It is situated approximately west of Hull, south east of York and south of Market Weighton town centre. The village has road links with the cities of Kingston upon Hull, York and Leeds. The eastern end of the M62 motorway, at Junction 38, is south-west from Hotham. According to the 2011 UK census, Hotham parish had a population of 233, a decrease on the 2001 UK census figure of 256. The village has about 100 houses, the Hotham Arms public house, and a village hall. Other amenities are in the neighbouring villages of North Cave and South Cave. The village is under the York postcode and the local authority is the East Riding of Yorkshire Council. The church dedicated to St Oswald was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1966 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. History Main Street Hotham was once the land of Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet, Governor of Hull, and his son John, often referred to as Captain Hotham. Sir John Hotham was knighted by King James I and was a Member of Parliament. In 1641, the Royalist army left an arsenal in the nearby city of Hull. Sir John Hotham was invested with the full authority of both Houses of Parliament to retain the arsenal regardless of circumstance. King Charles wrote to Sir John informing him of his intentions to join his son James, Duke of York who was residing in Hull. After holding a meeting in Ye Olde White Hart Inn on 23 April 1642 it was decided by majority vote that the gates of the city would be closed to the king. The king was furious and Sir John was dubbed a traitor. A siege of Hull by the king lasted for three weeks and although Sir John escaped to his manor at Scorborough he was arrested and taken to the Tower of London. The House of Commons ordered that money, plots of land and the goods belonging to Sir John be seized. In December 1644 he was tried and condemned to execution. Sir John's son, Captain Hotham, was also deemed guilty and executed. The estate was left to Captain Hotham's only son, also called John, aged 13. Like his grandfather, John became an MP for the local town of Beverley and went into exile in 1684 after the exclusion crisis. He returned with William of Orange in 1688 and was appointed the Governor of Hull in 1689. He died that year after becoming ill with a \\"chill\\" while travelling from Hull to Beverley. The Hotham family's estate is now in the nearby village of South Dalton. A railway line, now disused, once connected Hull, Beverley and York. The line was built by the York and North Midland Railway. The first passenger train ran from York to Market Weighton, where the line ended, on 3 October 1847. It was another 17 years before the rest of the line, from Market Weighton to Beverley, was completed. Lord Hotham, who owned much of the farmland between Market Weighton and Beverley, was reluctant to have a railway built across his estate on the Yorkshire Wolds. He finally agreed to let the railway through - on the condition that he was provided with his personal station, at and that no trains ran on Sundays. The first through train from Hull to York ran on 1 May 1865. In 1823 Hotham was a civil parish in the Wapentake of Harthill. The parish church was under the patronage of the King. Baines History, Directory and Gazetteer of the County of York recorded that a Roman road passed near the village and towards North and South Newbald. Population at the time was 293, with occupations including nine farmers and yeomen, two shopkeepers, a shoemaker, a bricklayer, a blacksmith, a corn miller, a carpenter, and a tailor. A clock maker also ran a village day school. A carrier operated between the village and Market Weighton and Hull twice weekly.

The matriarch of the family, Bessie, had high hopes and dreams for her family; however, despite her hopefulness, her largest fear is that her family will lose their home and all their possessions. This fear stems from a woman down the street who had this exact thing happen to her. The household consists of extended family such as Bessie's father, Jacob, her husband Myron, and their son Ralph, 21, and spinster daughter Hennie, 26. To top it all off, in order to ease the financial burden on the family, the Bergers have taken in an immigrant boarder, named Sam. Besides the desire for financial stability, there are other problems that the Bergers face, such as Hennie's unwanted pregnancy. To avoid this burden on the family, Bessie insists on the marriage between Hennie and the new immigrant boarder in order to save her family's reputation and her daughter's life. Hennie has no love for Sam. The family has very different views on the arranged marriage between Hennie and Sam. For example, Ralph, a more philosophical character of the play, is not in agreement with his mother's decision. Ralph very much resembles his grandfather who is an idealist. The Berger house is therefore divided into idealists and realists, much like society as a whole. In a turn of events, Jacob commits suicide after making Ralph the beneficiary of his life insurance policy, in hopes that this will give Ralph the freedom for which he yearns. Themes Odets brings to the table the issues of the importance of appearances in relation to respectability in society - how we appear to society is how we improve and gain status - as well as the contrasting worlds of idealism and realism. Odets also presents the contrasting of materialistic ideals and the importance of money in society. Through his writing, he zooms in on the economic burden that is placed on society and how it affects the lives of humans and the way they live their lives. He also shows how values can become blurred and perceptions can change with experience. =Characters= * Myron Berger the father of the family * Bessie Berger his wife * Hennie Berger their daughter, age 26 * Ralph Berger their son, age 21 * Uncle Morty Bessie's brother, a successful businessman * Jacob father of Bessie and Morty; a Marxist; he lives with the Bergers * Moe Axelrod a friend of the family who eventually boards with the Bergers * Sam Feinschreiber an immigrant who courts Hennie * Schlosser the janitor in the Bergers' apartment building  Productions  Federal Theater Project WPA Yiddish language production The play premiered on Broadway at the Belasco Theatre on February 19, 1935, running for 184 performances before closing on July 27, 1935; it returned two months later on September 9 for an additional 24 performances through September 28, 1935.

More simply, epulis fissuratum is where excess folds of firm tissue form inside the mouth, as a result of rubbing on the edge of dentures that do not fit well. It is a harmless condition and does not represent oral cancer. Treatment is by simple surgical removal of the lesion, and also by adjustment of the denture or provision of a new denture. It is a closely related condition to inflammatory papillary hyperplasia, but the appearance and location differs. Signs and symptoms The lesion is usually painless. The usual appearance is of two excess tissue folds in alveolar vestibule/buccal sulcus, with the flange of the denture fitting in between the two folds. It may occur in either the maxillary or mandibular sulci, although the latter is more usual. Anterior locations are more common than posterior. Less commonly there may be a single fold, and the lesion may appear on the lingual surface of the mandibular alveolar ridge. The swelling is firm and fibrous, with a smooth, pink surface. The surface may also show ulceration or erythema. The size of the lesion varies from less than 1 cm to involving the entire length of the sulcus. Causes Fibrous hyperplasia around a dental implant, caused by a broken denture clasp.Dorfman J, The Center for Special Dentistry. http://www.nycdentist.com/dental-photo- detail/2446/215/Oral-Pathology-Dental-Medicine-diagnosis-treatment-cyst The cause is usually pressure from the flange of a denture which causes chronic irritation and a hyperplastic response in the soft tissues. Women during pregnancy can also present with an epulis, which will resolve after birth. Fibroepithelial polyps, pedunculated lesions of the palate beneath an upper denture, are associated with this condition. A cobble-stone appearance similar to an epulis fissuratum in a patient without dentures can be diagnostic of Crohn's disease. Epulis fissuratum can also appear around dental implants. Diagnosis The diagnosis is made clinically, and usually this is clear cut if the lesion is associated with the flange of a complete denture. Tissue biopsy is not usually indicated before removal of the lesion, since the excises surgical specimen is usually sent for histopathologic examination and the diagnosis is confirmed retrospectively. Rarely, incisional biopsy may be indicated to rule out neoplasia, e.g. in the presence of suspicious ulceration. The appearance may also be confused with pyogenic granuloma. The excessive tissue is composed of cellular, inflamed fibrous connective tissue. The appearance of an epulis fissuratum microscopically is an overgrowth of cells from the fibrous connective tissue. The epithelial cells are usually hyperkeratotic and irregular, hyperplastic rete ridges are often seen. =Classification= Epulis (literally, 'on the gingiva') is a general term for any gingival or alveolar tumor (i.e. lump on the gum). This term describes only the location of a lump and has no implication on the histologic appearance of a lesion. Epulis is also sometimes used synonymously with epulis fissuratum, however other conditions are classified as epulides, e.g. giant cell epulis (peripheral giant cell granuloma), ossifying fibroid epulis (peripheral ossifying fibroma), and congenital epulis. Treatment Treatment is by surgical excision (complete removal) of the fibrous tissue overgrowth and addressing the causative factor to prevent recurrence of the lesion. Other sources suggest that surgical excision may not be required in all cases. Common techniques for removal of the excess tissue include traditional removal with a surgical scalpel, electrical scalpel, or laser excision with a laser scalpel, e.g. a carbon dioxide laser, erbium:YAG laser, Neodymium-YAG laser, or diode laser. The poorly fitting denture can be adapted to fit better (a \\"reline\\") or a new denture constructed. Alternatively, the section of flange that is sharp/over-extended can be smoothed and reduced with a drill. Prognosis If the causative factor persists, tissue will become more fibrous over time. Epidemiology This condition occurs in association with denture wearing, and so those affected tend to be middle aged or older adults. 66-75% are estimated to occur in women. Epulis fissuratum is the third most common reactive lesion that occurs in the mouth, after peripheral giant cell granuloma and pyogenic granuloma. References * Kahn, Michael A.

Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) were the first to suggest that neural activity is computational. They argued that neural computations explain cognition.Piccinini, Gualtierro & Bahar, Sonya, 2012. \\"Neural Computation and the Computational Theory of Cognition\\" in Cognitive Science. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/cogs.12012 The theory was proposed in its modern form by Hilary Putnam in 1967, and developed by his PhD student, philosopher and cognitive scientist Jerry Fodor in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.Putnam, Hilary, 1961. \\"Brains and Behavior\\", originally read as part of the program of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Section L (History and Philosophy of Science), December 27, 1961, reprinted in Block (1983), and also along with other papers on the topic in Putnam, Mathematics, Matter and Method (1979)Horst, Steven, (2005) \\"The Computational Theory of Mind\\" in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Despite being vigorously disputed in analytic philosophy in the 1990s due to work by Putnam himself, John Searle, and others, the view is common in modern cognitive psychology and is presumed by many theorists of evolutionary psychology. In the 2000s and 2010s the view has resurfaced in analytic philosophy (Scheutz 2003, Edelman 2008). The computational theory of mind holds that the mind is a computational system that is realized (i.e. physically implemented) by neural activity in the brain. The theory can be elaborated in many ways and varies largely based on how the term computation is understood. Computation is commonly understood in terms of Turing machines which manipulate symbols according to a rule, in combination with the internal state of the machine. The critical aspect of such a computational model is that we can abstract away from particular physical details of the machine that is implementing the computation. This is to say that computation can be implemented by silicon chips or neural networks, so long as there is a series of outputs based on manipulations of inputs and internal states, performed according to a rule. CTM, therefore holds that the mind is not simply analogous to a computer program, but that it is literally a computational system. Computational theories of mind are often said to require mental representation because 'input' into a computation comes in the form of symbols or representations of other objects. A computer cannot compute an actual object, but must interpret and represent the object in some form and then compute the representation. The computational theory of mind is related to the representational theory of mind in that they both require that mental states are representations. However, the representational theory of mind shifts the focus to the symbols being manipulated. This approach better accounts for systematicity and productivity. In Fodor's original views, the computational theory of mind is also related to the language of thought. The language of thought theory allows the mind to process more complex representations with the help of semantics. (See below in semantics of mental states). Recent work has suggested that we make a distinction between the mind and cognition. Building from the tradition of McCulloch and Pitts, the computational theory of cognition (CTC) states that neural computations explain cognition. The computational theory of mind asserts that not only cognition, but also phenomenal consciousness or qualia, are computational. That is to say, CTM entails CTC. While phenomenal consciousness could fulfill some other functional role, computational theory of cognition leaves open the possibility that some aspects of the mind could be non-computational. CTC therefore provides an important explanatory framework for understanding neural networks, while avoiding counter-arguments that center around phenomenal consciousness. \\"Computer metaphor\\" Computational theory of mind is not the same as the computer metaphor, comparing the mind to a modern-day digital computer.Pinker, Steven. The Blank Slate. New York: Penguin. 2002 Computational theory just uses some of the same principles as those found in digital computing. While the computer metaphor draws an analogy between the mind as software and the brain as hardware, CTM is the claim that the mind is a computational system. More specifically, it states that a computational simulation of a mind is sufficient for the actual presence of a mind, and that a mind truly can be simulated computationally. 'Computational system' is not meant to mean a modern-day electronic computer. Rather, a computational system is a symbol manipulator that follows step by step functions to compute input and form output. Alan Turing describes this type of computer in his concept of a Turing machine. Early proponents One of the earliest proponents of the computational theory of mind was Thomas Hobbes, who said, \\"by reasoning, I understand computation. And to compute is to collect the sum of many things added together at the same time, or to know the remainder when one thing has been taken from another. To reason therefore is the same as to add or to subtract.\\"Hobbes, Thomas \\"De Corpore\\" Since Hobbes lived before the contemporary identification of computing with instantiating effective procedures, he cannot be interpreted as explicitly endorsing the computational theory of mind, in the contemporary sense. Causal picture of thoughts At the heart of the computational theory of mind is the idea that thoughts are a form of computation, and a computation is by definition a systematic set of laws for the relations among representations. This means that a mental state represents something if and only if there is some causal correlation between the mental state and that particular thing. An example would be seeing dark clouds and thinking \\"clouds mean rain\\", where there is a correlation between the thought of the clouds and rain, as the clouds causing rain. This is sometimes known as natural meaning. Conversely, there is another side to the causality of thoughts and that is the non-natural representation of thoughts. An example would be seeing a red traffic light and thinking \\"red means stop\\", there is nothing about the color red that indicates it represents stopping, and thus is just a convention that has been invented, similar to languages and their abilities to form representations. Semantics of mental states The computational theory of mind states that the mind functions as a symbolic operator, and that mental representations are symbolic representations; just as the semantics of language are the features of words and sentences that relate to their meaning, the semantics of mental states are those meanings of representations, the definitions of the 'words' of the language of thought. If these basic mental states can have a particular meaning just as words in a language do, then this means that more complex mental states (thoughts) can be created, even if they have never been encountered before. Just as new sentences that are read can be understood even if they have never been encountered before, as long as the basic components are understood, and it is syntactically correct. For example: \\"I have eaten plum pudding every day of this fortnight.\\" While it's doubtful many have seen this particular configuration of words, nonetheless most readers should be able to glean an understanding of this sentence because it is syntactically correct and the constituent parts are understood. Criticism A range of arguments have been proposed against physicalist conceptions used in computational theories of mind. An early, though indirect, criticism of the computational theory of mind comes from philosopher John Searle. In his thought experiment known as the Chinese room, Searle attempts to refute the claims that artificially intelligent systems can be said to have intentionality and understanding and that these systems, because they can be said to be minds themselves, are sufficient for the study of the human mind. Searle asks us to imagine that there is a man in a room with no way of communicating with anyone or anything outside of the room except for a piece of paper with symbols written on it that is passed under the door. With the paper, the man is to use a series of provided rule books to return paper containing different symbols. Unknown to the man in the room, these symbols are of a Chinese language, and this process generates a conversation that a Chinese speaker outside of the room can actually understand. Searle contends that the man in the room does not understand the Chinese conversation. This is essentially what the computational theory of mind presents us‚Äîa model in which the mind simply decodes symbols and outputs more symbols. Searle argues that this is not real understanding or intentionality. This was originally written as a repudiation of the idea that computers work like minds. Searle has further raised questions about what exactly constitutes a computation: > the wall behind my back is right now implementing the WordStar program, > because there is some pattern of molecule movements that is isomorphic with > the formal structure of WordStar. But if the wall is implementing WordStar, > if it is a big enough wall it is implementing any program, including any > program implemented in the brain. Objections like Searle's might be called insufficiency objections. They claim that computational theories of mind fail because computation is insufficient to account for some capacity of the mind. Arguments from qualia, such as Frank Jackson's knowledge argument, can be understood as objections to computational theories of mind in this way‚Äîthough they take aim at physicalist conceptions of the mind in general, and not computational theories specifically. There are also objections which are directly tailored for computational theories of mind. Putnam himself (see in particular Representation and Reality and the first part of Renewing Philosophy) became a prominent critic of computationalism for a variety of reasons, including ones related to Searle's Chinese room arguments, questions of world-word reference relations, and thoughts about the mind-body relationship. Regarding functionalism in particular, Putnam has claimed along lines similar to, but more general than Searle's arguments, that the question of whether the human mind can implement computational states is not relevant to the question of the nature of mind, because \\"every ordinary open system realizes every abstract finite automaton.\\" Computationalists have responded by aiming to develop criteria describing what exactly counts as an implementation. Roger Penrose has proposed the idea that the human mind does not use a knowably sound calculation procedure to understand and discover mathematical intricacies. This would mean that a normal Turing complete computer would not be able to ascertain certain mathematical truths that human minds can.Roger Penrose, \\"Mathematical Intelligence,\\" in Jean Khalfa, editor, What is Intelligence?, chapter 5, pages 107-136. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 1994 Prominent scholars * Daniel Dennett proposed the multiple drafts model, in which consciousness seems linear but is actually blurry and gappy, distributed over space and time in the brain. Consciousness is the computation, there is no extra step or \\"Cartesian theater\\" in which you become conscious of the computation. * Jerry Fodor argues that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Further, this language of thought itself is codified in the brain, not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought. In later work (Concepts and The Elm and the Expert), Fodor has refined and even questioned some of his original computationalist views, and adopted a highly modified version of LOT (see LOT2). * David Marr proposed that cognitive processes have three levels of description: the computational level (which describes that computational problem (i.e., input/output mapping) computed by the cognitive process); the algorithmic level (which presents the algorithm used for computing the problem postulated at the computational level); and the implementational level (which describes the physical implementation of the algorithm postulated at the algorithmic level in biological matter, e.g. the brain). (Marr 1981) * Ulric Neisser coined the term 'cognitive psychology' in his book published in 1967 (Cognitive Psychology), wherein Neisser characterizes people as dynamic information-processing systems whose mental operations might be described in computational terms. * Steven Pinker described a \\"language instinct,\\" an evolved, built-in capacity to learn language (if not writing). * Hilary Putnam proposed functionalism to describe consciousness, asserting that it is the computation that equates to consciousness, regardless of whether the computation is operating in a brain, in a computer, or in a \\"brain in a vat.\\" * Georges Rey, professor at the University of Maryland, builds on Jerry Fodor's representational theory of mind to produce his own version of a Computational/Representational Theory of Thought.

It debuted at the 1966 Turin Auto Show. In 1966, Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera of Milan explored a new design concept. Their long relation with Lamborghini was celebrated with the Flying Star II, a fully functional prototype with a design that was unconventional for the time. It was a two-seater with a very low and compact two-volume shooting brake bodywork, with a hatchback-style rear door. The design team for the Flying Star II was lead by Carlo Anderloni. The name \\"Flying Star II\\" was a reference to the Touring \\"Flying Star\\" roadsters of the prewar period, designed by Giuseppe Seregni and built on Isotta Fraschini and Alfa Romeo chassis. The Flying Star was built on the chassis and drive train of the 400 GT production model, sharing its 3.9 L Lamborghini V12 engine, 5 speed manual transmission, fully independent suspension and four wheel disc brakes. The chassis was shortened by compared to the production 400 GT. This would be the last design to come out of Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera, before the company was revived in 2006 and introduced the A8GCS Berlinetta Touring based on a Maserati drivetrain in 2008.

In this madcap motoring animation, Goofy (during his \\"Everyman\\" period) transforms into a Mr. Hyde-type split personality, when he gets behind the wheel and provides the lowdown on how to not drive safely. Synopsis The cartoon shows how the character, as the pleasant, friendly, and good-natured \\"Mr. Walker\\" who \\"wouldn't hurt a fly nor step on an ant\\", undergoes a change in personality to the violent \\"Mr. Wheeler\\" when he gets behind the wheel of his yellow car. As Mr. Walker he's polite, safe, and good-natured while as Mr. Wheeler; he is very mean, reckless, and predatory. Upon reaching his destination in town (we are not shown the character's reason for traveling) and leaving his automobile, he reverts to the mild-mannered Mr. Walker, whereupon he is the victim of other motorists' unsafe (and sometimes even predatory) driving habits. However, once he returns to his car, he becomes Mr. Wheeler again, seeking to impose his own will upon traffic, to the point of blaming the tow truck which hauls him away for his slow pace after his own auto accident, and breaks the fourth wall by telling the narrator, while educating him (and the fourth wall) on safe driving habits with, \\"Ah, shut up!\\" The car The car that Goofy drives is a yellow Lincoln-Zephyr convertible.

History  Side view of the Marzal Designed by Marcello Gandini of Bertone, it was created to supply Ferruccio Lamborghini with a true four-seater car for his lineup which already included the 400GT 2+2 and the Miura. Mr. Lamborghini initially viewed the creation of the Marzal as advertising rather than a production model, stating: The Marzal remained a one-off, though the general shape and many of the ideas would later be used in the Lamborghini Espada. The Marzal's styling was radical at the time of its introduction, with magazine Road & Track calling it \\"A Bertone design so fresh that everything else looks old fashioned.\\" It was distinguished by glazed gull-wing doors and a strong hexagonal motif throughout, including in the louvered rear window, interior trim and unique Campagnolo magnesium wheels. Other innovative styling elements included silver interior upholstery and 6 narrow S.E.V. Marchal headlamps in the thin, wedge-shaped nose. Several companies made die-cast models based on the Marzal, including Dinky Toys and Matchbox. Many were in other colours such as orange, despite the original show car being painted silver. The Marzal appeared in action at a public event for the first time at the 1967 Monaco Grand Prix when Prince Rainier III, accompanied by his wife, Princess Grace, drove the car on his traditional parade lap before the start of the race.Grand Prix Historique 2018 ‚Äì a view form the pit lane, classiccartrust.com Retrieved 23 Auguist 2018 The car made a second public appearance at the 1996 Concorso Italiano in Monterey, California in honor of Carrozzeria Bertone. The Lamborghini Athon was also exhibited at this time. The Marzal was located for a long time in the Bertone Design Study Museum. It sold at RM Sotheby's Villa d'Este auction on for 1,512,000 Euros including buyer's premium.  Specifications  Marzal interior The Marzal was powered by a 2.0 L inline-six engine, which produced a claimed at 6800 rpm and a peak torque of at 4600 rpm. Top speed was estimated at . This engine was designed by Gian Paolo Dallara and was a split-in-half version of the 4.0L Lamborghini V12, mated to a 5-speed transaxle. It was equipped with three Weber 40 DCOE carburetors, with air intakes positioned directly behind the rear passengers' heads. The engine was mounted transversely in the rear of the car, fully behind the rear axle. The transaxle was from a Miura, with a higher final drive ratio of 5.30 to improve acceleration. The Marzal chassis was based on the production Miura chassis, extended by and stiffened. The resulting wheelbase was . The front hood was made from aluminum with the remaining non-glazed bodywork constructed from steel. Gross weight was . When visiting Bertone in the spring of 1967, journalist L.J.K. Setright observed that \\"five large blocks of metal and a moderately small anvil\\" had been placed in the front compartment of the Marzal in order to level the ride height from front to back. Overall length was , width and height . The suspension, steering and brakes used in the Marzal were all taken from the production Miura. Suspension travel was limited compared to the Miura, due to the design of the bodywork. Bertone designed unique 14 in diameter by 6.5 inch wide magnesium centerlock wheels, made by Campagnolo. These were similar in construction to those used on the Miura and Espada, but were visually unique, with two rows of nearly-hexagonal air ducts. Pirelli Cinturato HS tires in size 205-14 were fitted. In total, of glass paneling was used in the Marzal, all supplied by Glaverbel. This company had previously provided Bertone with the glass used in the Alfa Romeo Carabo and the Miura's rear window. An air conditioning system was installed in order to deal with the resulting high passenger compartment temperatures.

Christopher's parents died at sea when he was only four years old and his uncles, Guy Carleton (later created The 1st Baron Dorchester), the future Governor General of Canada and Commander-in- Chief, North America, along with Thomas Carleton, later the 1st Governor of New Brunswick, saw to his education and upbringing. At the age of twelve, Chistopher joined the British Army as an ensign in the 31st Regiment of Foot. Before his first tour of duty in North America, Chistopher married Anne Howard, whose sister Maria was the wife of Guy Carleton. While in North America, Christopher Carleton met Sir William Johnson and lived among the Mohawk Indians, learning their language and partaking in their customs. He would remark in later life that the time spent living with the Mohawks was the happiest of his life.Letters of Brunswick and Hessian Officers, pg 64 These skills would serve him well later. Christopher would be back in England when the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775. In May 1776, Captain Christopher Carleton arrived at Quebec City as part of a relief force for his uncle Sir Guy Carleton, as he was now, besieged in the city by the Continental Army forces. During the campaign leading up to the Battle of Valcour Island, Capt. Christopher Carleton served on his uncle's staff and in command of detachments of Indian allies. In 1777, Christopher purchased a major's commission in the 29th Regiment of Foot, in which his uncle, Thomas Carleton, was a lieutenant colonel. Raids In the autumn of 1778, Major Chistopher Carleton led a raid along the shores of Lake Champlain burning the towns along Otter Creek in Vermont and taking the local militia men prisoner. Carleton's Raid was very successful, destroying enough supplies for 12,000 men for a four-month campaign. Maj. Carleton also showed that he was an expert in leading Native American warriors along with British Regulars and Loyalist troops, a feat that not many British officers could claim. His time spent with the Mohawks in his youth had paid off. During the Burning of the Valleys campaign of 1780, Maj. Carleton lead another raid down Lake Champlain into the upper Hudson Valley capturing the forts at Fort Ann and Fort George with a mixed force of British Regulars, Loyalist troops, Hessians and Indians, including the 29th's unique ranger company of John Enys. The years spent on the cold northern frontiers of North America took their toll on now Lieutenant-Colonel Christopher Carleton's health and he died on June 14, 1787, at Quebec City.

For example, two days after the September 11 attacks, La Jornada newspaper published a cartoon where El Fisgon makes a comparison between the attacks and the multiple US military operations. La Jornada also published in September 2001 another cartoon where Magu states that: \\"As the world (global) policemen of the new millennium, the Americans are using torture techniques invented by the Mexican police in the last century\\". The freedom of speech extends to other Mexican newspapers. El Universal (Mexico City) published several cartoons where Boligan criticizes American military operations in Iraq, specially presenting a pair of soldiers as vultures who complain about the Mexican illegal immigration to the US, when at the same time they are invading Iraq. =United Kingdom= *On January 27, 2003, the day before Israeli elections, British newspaper The Independent published a cartoon depicting the Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon naked (with an Election badge acting as a Fig-leaf) sitting among bombed houses eating a baby while helicopters and tanks buzzed 'Vote Sharon', with Sharon saying \\"What's wrong, haven't you seen a politician kissing babies before\\". The cartoon was based on Goya's Saturn Devouring His Son and was penned after a pre-election raid by Israeli missiles on Gaza City. The cartoon was eventually selected as the \\"Cartoon of the Year\\" by the United Kingdom's Political Cartoon Society. The Israeli embassy, backed by the Sharon government, issued a complaint saying the cartoon was anti-semitic, however the Press Watchdog, the press complaints commission, said of the cartoon; \\"There is nothing inherently anti-semitic about the Goya image or about the myth of Saturn devouring his children, which has been used previously to satirise other politicians accused of sacrificing their own 'children' for political purposes\\". =United States= *Racist caricatures of African Americans have also appeared in the United States before the Civil Rights Movement, and occasionally since then as well. *During World War II, several American newspapers and major animated studios put out cartoons and films depicting the Japanese with exaggerated Asian features and as being untrustworthy or trickster figures, echoing the anti-Japanese racist sentiments common during the war period. *A cartoon in Los Angeles Times, published in October 2000, shows a Jew and a Muslim, praying at a wall where the stones are formed to read \\"Hate\\".

The concept is discussed in the context of European integration, historically in connection with hypothetical proposals, but since the formation of the European Union (EU) in the 1990s increasingly with regards to the project of ever-increasing federalisation of the EU. The model of a \\"pan-European\\" union is the Carolingian Empire, which united \\"Europe\\" in the sense of Latin Christendom. The original proposal for a Paneuropean Union was made in 1922 by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi. The term \\"pan-European\\" is to be understood not as referring to the modern geographic definition of the continent of Europe but in the historical sense of the western parts of continental Europe sharing the common history of Latin Christendom, the Carolingian Empire and the early modern Habsburg Empire. Coudenhove-Kalergi saw the pan-European state as a future \\"fifth great power\\", in explicit opposition to the Soviet Union, \\"Asia\\", Great Britain and the United States (as such explicitly excluding both the British Isles and Eastern Europe from his notion of \\"pan-European\\").\\"Eine Wiederherstellung der europ√§ischen Weltherrschaft ist unm√∂glich; wohl aber ist es noch m√∂glich, durch Zusammenfassung der europ√§ischen Staaten diesen Erdteil zu einer f√ºnften Weltmacht zusammenzuschliessen und so den Frieden, die Freiheit und den Wohlstand der Europ√§er zu retten.\\" Coudenhove-Kalergi, Paneurop√§isches Manifest (1923). After 1945, an accelerating process of European integration culminated in the formation of the European Union (EU) in 1993. In the period from 1995-2020, the EU has been enlarged from 12 to 27 member states, far beyond the area originally envisaged for the \\"pan-European\\" state by Coudenhove-Kalergi (with the exception of Switzerland), its member states accounting for a population of some 510 million, or two-thirds of the population of the entire continent. In the 1990s to 2000s, there was an active movement towards a federalisation of the European Union, with the introduction of symbols and institutions usually reserved for sovereign states, such as citizenship, a common currency (used by 19 out of 27 members), a flag, an anthem and a motto (In Varietate Concordia, \\"United in Diversity\\"). An attempt to introduce a European Constitution was made in 2004, but it failed to be ratified; instead, the Treaty of Lisbon was signed in 2007 in order to salvage some of the reforms that had been envisaged in the constitution. A debate on the feasibility and desirability of a \\"pan-European identity\\" or \\"European identity\\" has taken place in parallel to this process of political integration. A possible future \\"European identity\\" is seen at best as one aspect of a \\"multifaceted identity\\" still involving national or regional loyalties. Two authors writing in 1998 concluded that \\"In the short-term it seems that the influence of this project [of European integration] will only influence European identity in certain limited niches and in a very modest way. It is doubtful if this will do to ensure a smooth process of ongoing European integration and successfully address the challenges of the multicultural European societies.\\" Dirk Jacobs and Robert Maier, European identity: construct, fact and fiction in: A United Europe. The Quest for a Multifaceted Identity (1998) pp. 13-34. Even at that time, the development of a common European identity was viewed as rather a by-product than the main goal of the European integration process, even though it was actively promoted by both EU bodies and non-governmental initiatives, such as the Directorate- General for Education and Culture of the European Commission. With the rise of EU-scepticism and opposition to continued European integration by the early 2010s, the feasibility and desirability of such a \\"European identity\\" has been called into question.Kenneth Keulman, Agnes Katalin Ko√≥s, European Identity: Its Feasibility and Desirability (2014) History of pan-Europeanism Pan- Europeanism, as it emerged in the wake of World War I, derived a sense of European identity from the idea of a shared history, taken to be the source of a set of fundamental \\"European values\\". Typically the 'common history' includes a combination of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, the feudalism of the Middle Ages, the Hanseatic League, the Renaissance, the Age of Enlightenment, 19th century liberalism and different forms of socialism, Christianity and secularism, colonialism and the World Wars. The oldest European unification movement is the Paneuropean Union, founded in 1923 with the publishment of Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi's book Paneuropa, who also became its first president (1926‚Äì1972), followed by Otto von Habsburg (1973‚Äì2004) and Alain Terrenoire (from 2004). This movement initiated and supported the \\"integration process\\" pursued after World War II, which eventually led to the formation of the European Union. Notable \\"Paneuropeans\\" include Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schuman and Alcide De Gasperi. European values Especially in France, \\"the European idea\\" (l'id√©e d'Europe) is associated with political values derived from the Age of Enlightenment and the Republicanism growing out of the French Revolution and the Revolutions of 1848 rather than with personal or individual identity formed by culture or ethnicity (let alone a \\"pan-European\\" construct including those areas of the continent never affected by 18th-century rationalism or Republicanism).Marita Gilli, L'id√©e d'Europe, vecteur des aspirations d√©mocratiques: les id√©aux r√©publicains depuis 1848 : actes du colloque international organis√© √† l'Universit√© de Franche-Comt√© les 14, 15 et 16 mai 1992 (1994). The phrase \\"European values\\" arises as a political neologism in the 1980s in the context of the project of European integration and the future formation of the European Union. The phrase was popularised by the European Values Study, a long-term research program started in 1981, aiming to document the outlook on \\"basic human values\\" in European populations. The project had grown out of a study group on \\"values and social change in Europe\\" initiated by Jan Kerkhofs, and Ruud de Moor (Catholic University in Tilburg).Serendipities 2.2017 (1): 50‚Äì68  50ARTICLE Kristoffer Kropp, The cases of the European Values Study and the European Social Survey‚ÄîEuropean constellations of social science knowledge production, Serendipities 2.2017 (1): 50‚Äì68, . The claim that the people of Europe have a distinctive set of political, economic and social norms and values which are gradually replacing national values has also been named \\"Europeanism\\" by McCormick (2010).John McCormick, Europeanism (Oxford University Press, 2010) \\"European values\\" were contrasted to non-European values in international relations, especially in the East‚ÄìWest dichotomy, \\"European values\\" encompassing individualism and the idea of human rights in contrast to Eastern tendencies of collectivism. However, \\"European values\\" were also viewed critically, their \\"darker\\" side not necessarily leading more peaceful outcomes in international relations.Vilho Harle, European Values in International Relations , 1990, i-x (preface). The association of \\"European values\\" with European integration as pursued by the European Union came to the fore with the eastern enlargement of the EU in the aftermath of the Cold War. Adrian G. V. Hyde-Price, The International Politics of East Central Europe, Manchester University Press, 1996, p. 60. \\"The new nationalist myth in Eastern Europe thus attempts to define contemporary national identity in terms of European values and a European cultural heritage. The desire to return to Europe and embrace European values has led to a growing acceptance in much of East Central Europe of liberal democracy, human rights, multilateral cooperation and European integration.\\" The Treaty of Lisbon (2007) in article 2 lists a number of \\"values of the Union\\", including \\"respect for freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights including the rights of persons belonging to minorities\\", invoking \\"a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail\\".Treaty on the European Union, Title I: Common Provisions. The 2012 Eurobarometer survey reported that 49% of those surveyed described the EU member states as \\"close\\" in terms of \\"shared values\\" (down from 54% in 2008), 42% described them as \\"different\\" (up from 34% in 2008).LES VALEURS DES EUROP√âENS, Eurobarom√®tre Standard 77 (2012), p. 4. Identity factors It has been for long a matter of discussions to know whether or not this feeling of belonging was shared by a majority of Europeans, geographically speaking, and the strength of this feeling. There are discussions as well about the question of the objective factors or \\"Europeanness\\". An approach underlines how, for being European, a person would at least have to: * be a citizen of a state, located by stipulation, to be geographically within Europe; * speak a language which is officially accepted as one of the official languages of that state; * share an historical destiny with other people, within that state, speaking the aforementioned language; * share a cultural pattern with other such people, where the cultural pattern is seen as consisting of similar cognitive, evaluative and emotional elements\\". Usually four steps are considered as conditions in the building of cultural and political identity: * The recognition of a \\"self\\" distinct from others, \\"them\\". * The recognition that this \\"self\\", this \\"identification\\" is in opposition to \\"them\\". In order for an identity to thrive there must be a challenge, a competitive edge or conflicts of interests. *The establishment of a separate political identity involves a cognitive simplification of the world, where most events are interpreted in dual categories such as \\"European\\" versus \\"non-European\\". *The establishment of common expected and desired goals. Such goals can be elaborated as utopian systems or models, like the federalist and confederalist conceptions of a new European order, or as partial working solutions to pragmatically felt needs, such as those postulated by neo-functionalists. One of the clearly stated political objectives of the European Union is the deepening of the European identity feeling.  Cultural and linguistic identity  Defining a European identity is a very complex processes. From outside, \\"Europeanness\\" would be a thing for a Chinese or an American, but on the internal plan geography is not sufficient to define Europe in the eyes of Europeans. According to Jean-Baptiste Duroselle, \\"there has been, since men think, an immense variety of Europes\\". Paul Val√©ry cites three major heritages to define the European identity : the Greek democracy, the Roman Law, and the Judeo-Christian tradition. Yet Emmanuel Berl criticizes this thesis as reductive, since it supposes a level of \\"europeanness\\", decreasing for West to East. According to him, Europe is shape-shifting, and no culture historically prevails over another, and European Islam, which concerns around 8% of the population, is one of the many sides of European identity. = Eurobarometer surveys on identity = The Eurobarometer surveys show that European and national identities tend to add rather than rule themselves out. In 2009, 3 French out of 5 felt French and European, a feeling that dominated in every socio-political group except the National Front supporters. Yet this tendency is not geographically homogeneous : 63% of Britons favoured their sole nationalities (which has been one of the main explanations of the Brexit vote), against 27% Luxembourgian. During these surveys, the respondents are asked which notions they spontaneously associate with the EU. Democracy, Human Rights, Freedom of movement and the euro are the most cited. There are divergences between generations : those who knew war directly or through their parents narrations mention peace, while the younger evoke market economy. The idea that identity is built through opposition to other groups is also confirmed since 60% Europeans state they rather or fully agree with the idea that \\"compared with other continents, it is distinctly easier to see what Europeans have in common in terms of values\\" = Linguistic diversity = Five languages have more than 50 million native speakers in Europe: Russian, German, French, Italian and English. While Russian has the largest number of native speakers (more than 100 million in Europe), English has the largest number of speakers in total, including some 200 million speakers of English as a second language. There is no final account of all European languages, but the sole EU recognizes 24 official languages. For some, the linguistic diversity is constituent of European identity. In popular culture Aspects of an emerging \\"European identity\\" in popular culture may be seen in the introduction of \\"pan-European\\" competitions such as the Eurovision Song Contest (since 1956), the UEFA European Championship (since 1958) or, more recently, the European Games (2015). In these competitions, it is still teams or representatives of the individual nations of Europe that are competing against one another, but a \\"European identity\\" may argued to arise from the definition the \\"European\\" participants (often loosely defined, e.g. including Morocco, Israel and Australia in the case of the Eurovision Song Contest), and the emergence of \\"cultural rites\\" associated with these events.\\"Eurovision is something of a cultural rite in Europe.\\" In the 1990s and 2000s, participation in the Eurovision Song Contest was to some extent perceived as a politically significant confirmation of nationhood and of \\"belonging to Europe\\" by the then-recently independent nations of Eastern Europe.\\"We are no longer knocking at Europe‚Äôs door,\\" declared the Estonian Prime Minister after his country‚Äôs victory in 2001. \\"We are walking through it singing... The Turks saw their win in 2003 as a harbinger of entry into the EU, and after the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, tonight‚Äôs competition is a powerful symbol of Viktor Yushchenko‚Äôs pro-European inclinations.\\" Oj, oj, oj! It's Europe in harmony. The Times, 21 May 2005. \\"\\"This contest is a serious step for Ukraine towards the EU,\\" Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Tomenko said at the official opening of the competition.\\" BBC, Ukrainian hosts' high hopes for Eurovision Pan-European events not organised along national lines include the European Film Awards, presented annually since 1988 by the European Film Academy to recognize excellence in European cinematic achievements. The awards are given in over ten categories, of which the most important is the Film of the year. They are restricted to European cinema and European producers, directors, and actors.http://www.europeanfilmawards.eu/ The Ryder Cup golf competition is a biennial event, originally between a British and an American team, but since 1979 admitting continental European players to form a \\"Team Europe\\". The flag of Europe was used to represent \\"Team Europe\\" since 1991, but reportedly most European participants preferred to use their own national flags.\\"While some fans of the European players in golf's Ryder Cup unfurl the flag of the European Union, many persist in waving their national flags despite the multinational composition of the European team.\\" Alan Bairner, Sport, Nationalism, and Globalization: European and North American Perspectives (2001), p. 2. There have also been attempts to use popular culture for the propagation of \\"identification with the EU\\" on the behalf of the EU itself. These attempts have proven controversial. In 1997, the European Commission distributed a comic strip titled The Raspberry Ice Cream War, aimed at children in schools. The EU office in London declined to distribute this in the UK, due to an expected unsympathetic reception for such views. Captain Euro, a cartoon character superhero mascot of Europe, was developed in the 1990s by branding strategist Nicolas De Santis to support the launch of the Euro currency.Designweek, 19 February 1998.

In 2007, European Commission President Romano Prodi suggested that EU teams should carry the EU flag, alongside the national flag, at the 2008 Summer Olympics ‚Äì a proposal which angered eurosceptics. According to Eurobarometer surveys, only 5% of respondents think that a European Olympic team would make them feel more of a 'European citizen'.Eurobarometer 251, p 45, .  Institutional actions to promote European identity  The European institutions made several concrete attempts to reinforce two things: identity contents (what is Europe in people's minds?) and identity formation (what makes people feel European?). The .eu domain name extension was introduced in 2005 as a new symbol of European Union identity on the World Wide Web. The .eu domain's introduction campaign specifically uses the tagline \\"Your European Identity\\". Registrants must be located within the European Union. = Direct policies = On the cultural plan, the European Union began a policy in the 70s with the directive \\"Television without Frontiers\\", which allowed free trade of TV programs and guaranteed more than half of the air time to European operas. The Culture program finances other cultural activities in order to strengthen the European common identity. The European Union also bet on symbols: the flag, the anthem (\\"Ode to Joy\\" from the final movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony), the motto \\"In varietate concordia\\", the Europe day. Great cultural unifying events are organised, such as the European heritage days, or the election of the Capital of Culture. The youth mobility has been encouraged since the launching of the Erasmus programme in 1987, which has permitted students to go to 33 European countries. The challenge of communication, to make the European project more understandable to the 500 million citizens, in 24 languages, has also been addressed: in 2004, the first Vice-President of the Commission has the Communication Strategy portfolio. The common values are reasserted through the judicial action of the European Court of Human Rights. Linked to this, the European Union funds many surveys (such as Eurobarometer) and scientific studies, to improve its identity-building policies. A collection of such studies is for example The development of European Identity/Identities : Unfinished Business  The boundaries of European identity  Just as every sociological identity, the European identity is not as much defined by its contents than by its boundaries. There are today heated political debates on whether to or not to allow immigrants coming to Europe, and on which criteria. The debate is also on whether to integrate or assimilate people that come form very different cultures, and how to do it. Many European right-wing politicians are now advocating a vision of European identity (often seen as a White and Christian one) as a citadel being threaten by immigration, and thus needing to be defended by harsher policies on this matter. A new far right movement even baptized itself the Identitarians. Their adversaries often say that this vision of Europe is racist, and that it symbolically excludes people who are already European by law. The geographical definitions of Europe do not seem to be a matter of discussion any more, but the question of a European identity arises concerning countries that are geographically part of Asia as well, such as Russia or Turkey. The question also arises when it comes to European territories outside of (geographical) Europe, such as the French overseas departments. French Guianese, for example, are European citizens even though they are born and live in South America. Criticism The risk, defining a European identity, is to close up from other cultures that would not correspond to pre-defined criteria. To face this difficulty, vagueness is necessary: the Treaty of Lisbon mentions, for example, \\"cultural, religious and humanist inheritance\\". Moreover, it would be illusory to impose a principle of cultural homogeneity to states with various national identities. Jean-Marc Ferry considers that the European construction developed new differentiation, between citizenship and nationality for example, with the birth of post national citizenship in 1992. According to Raymond Aron, the construction can predate the European sentiment, but the last is essential to avoid a fictional Europe, a Europe that would only be a meaningless word in which the people do not recognize themselves. This idea is backed by Jacques Delors, who wrote in 1992 that it is needed to \\"give Europe a soul, (...) a spirituality, a meaning\\" beyond the simple economic and administrative realities.

The lesion almost exclusively involves the hard palate, and in rare instances, it also has been seen on the mandible. The lesion is mostly asymptomatic and color of the mucosa may vary from pink to red. In general, IPH is associated with the use of removable upper dentures, although it also has been found in dentulous patients with no history of a dental prosthesis. The majority of lesions are found beneath ill-fitting dentures of long use and in patients who do not take their dentures out overnight. The lesion seems to result from a combination of chronic, mild trauma which permit frictional irritation. A poor fitting denture never acquires papillomatosis. However, there must be some unidentified predisposing factors present in those patients who develop the lesion. It is also induced by low-grade infection by bacteria or Candida yeast. It is occasionally seen in patients without dentures but with high palatal vaults or those with habit of breathing through the mouth. Signs and symptoms Papillary hyperplasia is seen in middle-aged and older persons, and there is a strong female predilection (2:1). The disease occurs on the bone-bound oral mucosa of the hard palate and alveolar ridges. Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia is usually asymptomatic. It presents as a cluster of individual papules or nodules that may be erythematous, somewhat translucent, or normal in surface coloration. Mucosa is erythematous and has a pebbly or papillary surface. Many cases are associated with denture stomatitis. Often the entire vault of the hard palate is involved, with the alveolar mucosa being largely spared. White cottage cheese‚Äìlike colonies of Candida may be seen in clefts between papules. There is seldom pain, but a burning sensation may be produced by the yeast infection. Early papules are more edematous, whereas older ones are more fibrotic and firm, being individually indistinguishable from irritation fibroma. Candida -associated palatal papillary hyperplasia also has been reported in dentate patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.  Cause  The origin of the lesion is unclear. This condition appears to be of an inflammatory nature. An excessive denture palatal relief area, creating a void between the denture base and the tissue of the palate, encourages food entrapment and so encouraging bacterial and fungal growth between the two surfaces. This was demonstrated in 80 per cent of the patients. The other causes may include ill- fitting or poorly contoured dentures, irritation of the palatal salivary glands poor oral hygiene and continuous day and night denture use. ll-fitting or poorly contoured dentures can result in excessive frictional movement of the denture bases on the oral mucosa, creating the chances of developing inflammatory papillary hyperplasia. Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia is commonly associated with Candida infection. Strong correlation between denture stomatitis and poor hygiene in the use of prostheses have been found in a few studies in Brazil. Denture stomatitis is the most frequent denture related mucosal lesion and is always associated with Candida albicans. Colonization of Candida albicans is caused by poor oral hygiene. However, Candida albicans infection is an opportunistic event and is not consequential for developing denture stomatitis and inflammatory papillary hyperplasia. Gender was also found to be another significant factor from studies in Brazil. Females usually live longer than men, causing more tooth loss to happen among women and more women wear dentures (and for longer periods) than men. Hence, women have higher chance of getting inflammatory papillary hyperplasia. Oral mucosa of women is more susceptible to hyperplastic change than that of men due to postmenopausal changes to the oral mucosa, Diagnosis= Classification = This has been generally based on the clinical appearance of the inflamed mucosa seen under maxillary complete dentures. The classification of Newton (1962) has been the most widely used. He proposed three types: (1) Pinpoint hyperaemic foci, (2) Diffuse hyperaemia of denture-supporting tissues, and (3) Papillary hyperplasia. Budtz-Jorgensen & Bertram (1970) used different terminology for the same changes: (1) Simple localized inflammation, (2) Simple diffuse (generalized) inflammation, and (3) Granular inflammation. Bergendal (1982) included only diffuse and papillary varieties and referred to atrophic or hyperplastic denture stomatitis. Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia is a hyperplasia (overgrowth) of soft tissue, usually beneath a denture. It is associated with poor denture hygiene, denture overuse, and ill- fitting dentures. It is a closely related condition to inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia (epulis fissuratum), but the appearance and location differs. =Histopathology= Epithelium is able to grow into the subjacent connective tissue in response to chronic inflammation. Mild trauma, and constant irritation to the oral mucosa histologically manifests as acanthosis and hyperparakeratosis. This defensive thickening is a primary function of epithelium. Histopathologically, numerous papillary projections are usually covered by hyperplastic stratified squamous epithelium with or without chronic inflammation. Pseudoepitheliomatous appearance can be seen In advanced cases, this hyperplasia is pseudoepitheliomatous in appearance. A chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate containing lymphocytes and plasma cells is usually seen, Rarely, polymorphonuclear leukocytes are also present. Proliferation of fibrovascular tissue occurs in nodules with a variable lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. = Differential Diagnosis = *Inflamed squamous papilloma: usually solitary and pedunculated. * Human papillomavirus‚Äìassociated papillary lesions or condylomas: they contain koilocytes Treatment For early lesions of inflammatory papillary hyperplasia, cessation of denture use for 2 to 4 weeks may allow the lesion to completely subside. This may be aided by use of topical antibiotic or antifungal therapies. Small lesions are also typically treated with mouthrinses such as chlorhexidine mouthrinse at 0.12% or antifungal mouthrinse/ gels. For more advanced and large lesions, excision of the hyperplastic tissue may be required before fabricating a new denture. Several surgical methods have been used, including: * Partial-thickness or full- thickness surgical blade excision * Electrosurgery * Curettage * Laser surgery * Cryosurgery Lesions removed by electrosurgery require an average of 30 to 33 days to heal, whereas lesions removed by surgical curettage require around 21 to 23 healing days. During healing interval, the existing denture can be lined with a temporary tissue conditioner that acts as a palatal dressing and provides greater comfort. Surgical removal of the lesion and the making of new dentures are effective in eradication of the lesion. Good oral hygiene practice is very important in preventing repetition of events leading to the condition again. Proper denture hygiene care should be carried out as instructed by your dentist and nocturnal use of dentures should be eliminated. Epidemiology Due to the strong association with denture-wearing, the lesion tends to occur more in adults than children. There is no gender predilection. In people who wear dentures 24 hours a day, its incidence is around 20%. Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia almost exclusively involves the hard palate, specifically the vault of the palate. Extension of the lesion to the mucosa of the residual ridges have also been observed. 11% to 13.9% of patients who wear maxillary complete dentures with complete palatal coverage has been reported to have IPH.

He invented a combination of malted and farina wheat\\" (06/30/2008 9:00PM) Episode: CW1708 Food Network hot breakfast cereal he called Malt-O-Meal. Campbell intended to compete with Cream of Wheat. In 1927, the company moved production of its cereal to the Ames Mill in Northfield, Minnesota. Nine years later, corporate headquarters were moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and in 1953, it was renamed the Malt-O-Meal Company. Attempts in the 1940s to market Campbell's Corn Flakes, and in the 1960s to sell State Fair brand Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice, were abandoned in the face of competition. The company sponsors \\"Make it with Malt-O-Meal\\" State Fair Recipe Contests at the Oregon and Arizona State Fairs. In 2002, Malt-O-Meal acquired the bagged cereal business from the Quaker Oats Company. In 2007, Malt-O-Meal took part in the \\"reverse product placement\\" marketing campaign for The Simpsons Movie and packaged one of their cereals, Tootie Frooties, as \\"Krusty-O's\\". The cereal was sold in 7-Eleven stores across America along with other The Simpsons Movie related products. In 2007, Malt-O-Meal began construction on their new manufacturing facility in Asheboro, North Carolina. The building, formerly occupied by Unilever Best Foods, became the fourth manufacturing facility for Malt-O-Meal. Operations at the plant began in late 2008. In December 2009, Malt-O-Meal acquired the Farina brand of hot cereal from U.S. Mills. Farina was started by Pillsbury in 1898. On February 21, 2012, the Malt-O-Meal Company re-branded as MOM Brandsthe new name is intended to reflect the company's wider product range, while still acknowledging its flagship product through the use of its abbreviation. At the same time, it also announced that it had surpassed Post to become the third largest producer of cereals in the United States. MOM Brands purchased the CoCo Wheats brand from Denny and Kim Fuller on June 30, 2012, while the rest of the company assets except the factory building were sold to Gilster-Mary Lee, a major competitor. The Fullers had become the fourth generation to own and operate Little Crow in 1983. October 11, 2013, MOM Brands announced a reduction in force that would affect approximately 100 employees. Voluntary separations were taken until October 18 and resulted in 35 people applying, but not all were approved. Remaining employees were notified beginning October 25, with 88 employees affected. On January 27, 2015, Post Holdings announced that it was purchasing MOM Brands for $1.15 billion ($1.05 billion cash and 2.5 million shares of Post Holdings stock).

In particular, he is best known as the Minister for Civil Aviation between 1966 and 1969. He represented the Division of Darling Downs in the House of Representatives between 1949 and 1972 and was a member of the Government for the entire length of his parliamentary service. Swartz Barracks at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre is named for him. Early life Swartz was born in Brisbane in 1911 and attended Toowoomba Grammar School. He joined the 2nd AIF during World War II. Swartz was a member of the 2/26th Infantry Battalion of the Australian 8th Division in the Battle of Malaya. After capture by the Japanese, he was a prisoner of war in Changi prison and worked on the Burma‚ÄìThailand Railway. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his war service. In 1988, he accompanied John Howard along with two other parliamentarians who were former POWs, John Carrick and Tom Uren, to the opening of the Hellfire Pass Memorial Museum, commemorating the 2700 Australians who died working on the Burma-Thailand Railway. Parliamentary career Swartz in 1954. Swartz was elected as the Liberal member for Darling Downs in 1949. As such, he was a \\"Forty-niner\\" which was the name for the Liberal and Country Party members first elected in the landslide victory by the Coalition in that year. Menzies appointed Swartz as Parliamentary Secretary for Trade in 1956. In that position, he led Trade Missions to India in 1956 and South East Asia in 1958. He was appointed as Minister for Repatriation in 1961 and served in that position before becoming Minister for Health from 1964 to 1966 and briefly Minister for Social Services in early 1965. Harold Holt appointed Swartz as Minister for Civil Aviation in 1966 and he served in that Ministry for three years. John Gorton appointed him as Minister for National Development in 1969 and he served in that position for three years.

Known for his bravery in war, and skills in oratory and diplomacy, Running Antelope was one of four Hu≈ãkpap»üa principal chiefs who acted as close advisors to Sitting Bull during the Plains Indian Wars. His belief that compromise with the whites was in their best interests led to his eventually distancing himself from Sitting Bull. He is the only American Indian depicted on U.S. paper money, but the picture caused ill will as the Series 1899 $5 Silver Certificate pictured Running Antelope as a chief wearing a Pawnee head dress as the original Sioux head dress was too tall for the engraving. Early life When Running Antelope was born near the Grand River, presently South Dakota, in 1821, few white men were in the area. Consequently, he grew up in the old traditions of his people. He learned to ride and hunt, and later went on horse-stealing expeditions and war parties and joined the secret societies. By the time he reached manhood things had changed. The whites were more numerous, and the Indians were forced to adapt to the new conditions. Many Sioux took up arms and became strong in warfare; the Hunkpapas, one of the smaller bands of the Tetons, became one of the strongest. Running Antelope, however, was one of the first Hunkpapas to reject the warpath and become a friend of the whites. Running Antelope, in his earlier years, was closely allied with Sitting Bull, who was eleven years his junior. Running Antelope, a band chief, was prominent among the Lakota. Hunkpapa leader In 1851, Running Antelope was elected one of four \\"shirt wearers\\" of the H√∫≈ãkpap»üa. A shirt wearer served to intercede between the council and the headmen and ak√≠ƒçhita who carried out tribal policy and decisions. He was a brave warrior and accomplished diplomat. A great council with the Sioux was called at Fort Laramie and Fort Rice in 1868. Running Antelope signed the Treaty of 1868 at Fort Rice. It was often said that Running Antelope was the greatest orator of the Sioux Nation. He attended the Fort Laramie, Fort Rice and Fort Peck treaty councils. Under the influence of James McLaughlin, he became a dominant leader of the reservation Hunkpapa people at the Grand River Agency. He was enrolled in 1868 at Grand River Agency, later part of Standing Rock Reservation in North and South Dakota. After the allotment period. Running Antelope established a settlement of about sixty families in the Grand River valley and opened a store. In his later years, he regretted signing the 1868 Treaty and longed for the time when the Lakota were free, and realigned with Sitting Bull. Late in 1880, the followers of Sitting Bull began to return from exile in Canada and in the spring of 1881, Running Antelope was enlisted as a scout in the army to go to Fort Buford to escort Gall and his followers to Standing Rock. Last buffalo hunt He was chosen to lead the last great Sioux buffalo hunt in June, 1882. A large herd was sighted about a hundred miles west of Fort Yates, and a hunting of 2,000 men, women and children left the fort on June 10. The next morning the herd numbering approximately 50,000 buffalo was sighted and the hunt was on. About 2,000 were killed the first day, and the camp moved up to the scene of the hunt and the butchering began. The next day another 3,000 were killed and the camp settled in near a creek to jerk the meat and prepare pemmican. As usual when meat was plentiful, the labors of the Indian camp were lightened by feasting. Later life Running Antelope depicted on the 1899 $5 Silver Certificate. In 1899, Running Antelope was pictured on the Five-Dollar Silver Certificate. He died between June 30, 1896 and June 30, 1897. He is buried at the Long Hill Cemetery east of Little Eagle, South Dakota. On the 1885 Standing Rock ration list, he had ten lodges and 42 people in his care.

Most biographies incorrectly report that Iron Tail fought in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and that his family was killed in 1890 at Wounded Knee, when in truth it was Iron Hail who suffered the loss.It is unknown exactly when Iron Tail joined Colonel Cody. In 1910, the New York Times reported that \\"Iron Tail has been associated with Buffalo Bill for some eighteen years. See \\"Ogallallas Make A Little Boy Chief\\", New York Times, May 9, 1910. Major Israel McCreight reported: \\"Iron Tail was not a war chief and no remarkable record as a fighter. He was not a medicine man or conjuror, but a wise counselor and diplomat, always dignified, quiet and never given to boasting. He seldom made a speech and cared nothing for gaudy regalia, very much like the famed War Chief Crazy Horse. In this respect he always had a smile and was fond of children, horses and friends.\\"Puffs From the Peace Pipe\\", p. 10.

Col. Cody himself accompanied the party from the town of his name to Chicago. He will arrive here this morning and see that Iron Tail and his party sail.\\" New York Times, February 8, 1906.

On one of his visits to The Wigwam of Major Israel McCreight, Buffalo Bill asked Iron Tail to illustrate in pantomime how he played and won a game of poker with U S. army officials during a Treaty Council in the old days. \\"Going through all the forms of the game from dealing to antes and betting and drawing a last card during which no word was uttered and his countenance like a statue, he suddenly swept the table clean into his blanket and rose from the table and strutted away.

Iron Tail and Gertrude K√§sebier = Photographing the Sioux = Gertrude K√§sebier was one of the most influential American photographers of the early 20th century and best known for her evocative images of Native Americans. K√§sebier spent her childhood on the Great Plains living near and playing with Sioux children. In 1898, K√§sebier watched Buffalo Bill's Wild West troupe parade past her Fifth Avenue studio in New York City, toward Madison Square Garden. Her memories of affection and respect for the Lakota people inspired her to send a letter to Buffalo Bill requesting permission to photograph Sioux traveling with the show in her studio. Buffalo Bill and K√§sebier were similar in their abiding Native American culture and maintained friendships with the Sioux. Buffalo Bill quickly approved K√§sebier's request and she began her project on Sunday morning, April 14, 1898. K√§sebier's project was purely artistic and her images were not made for commercial purposes and never used in Buffalo Bill's Wild West program booklets or promotional posters.Delaney, \\"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude K√§sebier\\", Smithsonian National Museum of American History (2007). = A session with Chief Iron Tail = Buffalo Bill Cody told Major Israel McCreight that \\"Chief Iron Tail is the finest man I know, bar none.\\" K√§sebier took classic photographs of the Sioux while they were relaxed. Chief Iron Tail was one of K√§sebier's most challenging portrait subjects. K√§sebier's session with Iron Tail was her only recorded story: \\"Preparing for their visit to K√§sebier's photography studio, the Sioux at Buffalo Bill's Wild West Camp met to distribute their finest clothing and accessories to those chosen to be photographed.\\" K√§sebier admired their efforts, but desired to, in her own words, photograph a \\"real raw Indian, the kind I used to see when I was a child', referring to her early years in Colorado and on the Great Plains. K√§sebier selected one Indian, Iron Tail, to approach for a photograph without regalia. He did not object. The resulting photograph was exactly what K√§sebier had envisioned: a relaxed, intimate, quiet, and beautiful portrait of the man, devoid of decoration and finery, presenting himself to her and the camera without barriers. Several days later, Iron Tail was given the photograph and he immediately tore it up, stating that it was too dark.Delaney, \\"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude K√§sebier\\", Smithsonian National Museum of American History (2007), at p.16. K√§sebier re-photographed him, this time in his full feather headdress, much to his satisfaction. Chief Iron Tail was an international celebrity. He appeared with his fine regalia as the lead with Buffalo Bill at the Avenue des Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris, France, and the Colosseum of Rome. Iron Tail was a superb showman and chaffed at the photo of him relaxed. but K√§sebier chose it as the frontispiece for a 1901 Everybody's Magazine article. K√§sebier believed all the portraits were a \\"revelation of Indian character,\\" showing the strength and individual character of the Native Americans in \\"new phases for the Sioux.\\"Delaney, \\"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude K√§sebier\\", Smithsonian National Museum of American History (2007), p.16-17.  The Indian on the nickel  Indian Head Nickel, 1913, James Earle Fraser Early in the twentieth century, Iron Tail's distinctive profile became well known across the United States as one of three models for the five-cent coin Buffalo nickel or Indian Head nickel. The popular coin was introduced in 1913 and showcases the native beauty of the American West. Bee Ho Gray, the famous Wild West performer, accompanied Iron Tail to act as an interpreter and guide to Washington D.C. and New York where Iron Tail modeled for sculptor James Earle Fraser as he worked on designs for the new Buffalo nickel.The Native American depiction on the coins obverse is believed to be based on three different American Indians. Two of the American Indians who modeled for Fraser as he sculpted the coin were named by the designer before his death. They were Iron Tail of the Lakota Sioux and Chief Two Moons of the Cheyenne. Although many have claimed to have had a sitting with Fraser for this design, he could not recall the name of the third person, and satisfactory documentation has not yet been found to identify that individual. It is widely believed that the bison on the coin's reverse was modeled after Black Diamond, a popular attraction at the New York Zoological Gardens. http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/nickel/?action=fraser In 1931, Fraser wrote that he had used three Indians for the piece, including \\"Irontail, the best Indian head I can remember. The other one was Two Moons, the other I cannot recall.\\" David Q. Bowers, \\"A Guide Book of Buffalo and Jefferson Nickels (2007). Iron Tail was the most famous Native American of his day and a popular subject for professional photographers who circulated his image across the continents.  Iron Tail and Major Israel McCreight  Chief Iron Tail was a friend of Major Israel McCreight and a frequent visitor to The Wigwam in DuBois, Pennsylvania. Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk considered The Wigwam their home in the East. On June 22, 1908, Iron Tail presided over a ceremony at the tent of Buffalo Bill adopting McCreight as an honorary Chief of the Oglala Lakota. In 1915, McCreight hosted a grand reception for Iron Tail and Flying Hawk at The Wigwam. = Adoption of ƒåha≈ãt√© T»ü√°≈ãka = Iron Tail in Scotland, Buffalo Bill's Wild West, 1904 On June 22, 1908, Iron Tail and \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody visited Du Bois, Pennsylvania with the Wild West Congress of Rough Riders. Twelve thousand people a day attended Cody's Wild West performances and 150 Oglalas were in town with 150 ponies. On this occasion, Iron Tail presided over the adoption of Major Israel McCreight as an honorary Chief of the Oglala Lakota and named McCreight \\"ƒåha≈ãt√© T»ü√°≈ãka (\\"Great Heart\\").In later years, McCreight used the name \\"Tchanta Tanka\\" because it was spelled as Cante Tanka was pronounced in Lakota. Since most of the Native members did not know phonetics and spelling, they did not write out the name for McCreight, and since their language was not written, people would come close to approximating the sound and put together a spelled version. Chet Baranowski, Senior Advisor of Native American Studies at the Niagara Falls Museum, Niagara Falls, Canada. Iron Tail performed the ceremony assembled at Buffalo Bill's tent and attended by Chief American Horse, Chief Whirlwind Horse, Chief Lone Bear and 100 Oglala Lakota members of the Wild West Congress of Rough Riders. The Oglala Lakota chiefs formed a small circle around McCreight and his wife Alice, and Iron Tail began the ceremony with a speech in Lakota, a hearty handshake all around, and then placed a war bonnet McCreight's head and moccasins upon his feet. Iron Tail then presented McCreight with a tepee on which an owl had been traced with yellow chalk and told this was for him and Alice to live in. Tom-tom drums were then beaten and tribal songs put up vigorously. Concluding remarks were made by Iron Tail ending with hearty handshakes. Iron Tail and Buffalo Bill were loaded into a new 1908 Rambler touring car and driven to McCreight's town house for the banquet which followed. There, Iron Tail was presented with a new Winchester rifle as a souvenir of the event. McCreight was forever moved by the solemnity of the occasion, and carried the honor proudly and with distinction the rest of his life. McCreight later remarked that the title, honorary Chief of the Oglala Lakota, was a far greater tribute than could have been conferred by any president or military organization. M.I. McCreight, Iron Tail and Flying Hawk, 1906 = Grand Reception at The Wigwam = Grand Reception for Chief Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk, The Wigwam, DuBois, Pennsylvania, 1915 In 1915, McCreight hosted a grand reception for Chief Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk at The Wigwam in Du Bois, Pennsylvania. \\"When Chief Iron Tail was finished with greeting the long line of judges, bankers, lawyers, business men and neighbors who filed past in a receiving line just as the President is obliged to receive and shake the hands of multitude of strangers who call on New Years, the chief grasped hold of the fine buffalo robe which had been thrown over a porch bench for him to rest on drawing it around his shoulders, walked out on the lawn and lay down to gaze into the clouds and over the hundred mile sweep of the hills and valleys forming the Eastern Continental Divide. He had fulfilled his social obligations when he had submitted to an hour of incessant hand-shaking, as he could talk in English, further crowd mixing did not appeal to him. He preferred to relax and smoke his redstone pipe and wait his call to the big dining room. There he re-appeared in the place of honor and partook of the good things in the best of grace and gentlemanly deportment. His courteous behavior, here and at all places and occasions when in company of the writer, was worthy of emulation by the most exalted white man or woman!\\" After Chief Iron Tail had shaken hands with the assembled guests he gathered the big buffalo hide about his shoulders, waived aside the crowd and walked away. He spread the woolly robe on the grass, sat down upon it and lit his pipe, as if to say, \\"I've done my social duty, now I wish to enjoy myself.\\"Puffs From the Peace Pipe, p.10., Firewater and Forked Tongues, p.xxiii-xxiv. Chief Flying Hawk long remembered the gala festivities. \\"Here he himself and his close friend Iron Tail had held a reception once long ago, for hundreds of their friends, when bankers, preachers, teachers, businessmen, farmers, came from near and far along with their ladies, to pay their respects and say, How Cola!\\" \\"The historian Chief Flying Hawk reminded that when dinner was served, Iron Tail asked to have his own and Flying Hawk's meals brought to them on the open porch where they ate from a table he now sat beside, while the many white folks occupied the dining-room, where they could discuss Indians without embarrassment. This, he remembered, was a good time, and they talked about it for a long time together, but now, his good friend had left him and was in the Sand Hills.\\"Firewater and Forked Tongues, p.42.  Final days  In May 1916, Chief Iron Tail, at the age of 74, became ill with pneumonia while performing with the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Wild West in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was placed in St. Luke's Hospital. Buffalo Bill was obliged to go on with his show next day to Baltimore, Maryland, and Iron Tail was left alone in a strange city with doctors and nurses who could not communicate with him. McCreight learned about the Chief's admission to the hospital in the morning Philadelphia paper, and immediately sent a telegram to Buffalo Bill to send Iron Tail by next train to Du Bois, Pennsylvania, for care at The Wigwam. No reply was had and the wire was not delivered or forwarded to Baltimore. Instead the hospital authorities put Iron Tail on a Pullman, ticketed for home to the Black Hills. On May 28, 1916, when the porter of his car went to wake him at South Bend, Indiana, Iron Tail was dead, his body continuing on to its destination.Iron Tail was reported in the Cook County, Illinois, Deaths Index, 1872-1922, as born abt 1842, and place of death, Chicago, Cook, Illinois, on May 29, 1916. Iron Tail's occupation is listed as Showman, with his residence and place of burial as Rushville, Nebraska. His age is reported as 74.

In March 2007 the battalion on its 4th combat deployment operated in Kahn ar Bagdadi, Ar Rutbah, Albu Hyatt and Anah, located in Al Anbar province. From July 2008 through February 2009 the battalion deployed to Al Habbaniyah in the Al Anbar province. The battalion also spent a portion of its 5th deployment to Iraq in Sinjar, located in the Ninawa province. Operation Enduring Freedom The battalion deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in March 2010. Their area of operations (AO) included Now Zad, Salaam Bazaar, Karamanda, Kunjak, Musa Qala, and the Musa Qala Wadi down to Sangin. The battalion took heavy casualties but was able to push out a large portion of the Taliban in the AO and double the size of the AO that they were responsible for. For their exceptional actions, First Battalion Second Marines, along with several attachments were awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Presidential Unit Citation. 1/2 came home in late September 2010 when they were relieved by 1st Battalion 8th Marines. 1/2 deployed again in support of OEF in 2014. Charlie Company manned Patrol Base Boldak and conducted operations in Boldak, Habibibad, Showal, and Mataque, denying the Taliban the ability to conduct attacks on Camp Bastion-Leatherneck during retrograde operations. The rest of the Marines and Sailors patrolled the surrounding area of the Bastion-Leatherneck complex to ensure the safety of coalition forces operating on the bases until full security responsibility of the area was transferred to the Afghan National Security Forces in October 2014. 1/2 was the last U.S. ground combat unit on Camp Leatherneck, flying out on helicopters hours after control of the base was transferred to ANSF.

Biography=Early life= Sturdivant was born on February 14, 1782, in North Yarmouth, Massachusetts (now in the state of Maine). He was the third son of David A. Sturdivant and Jane Greely. Both parents were descended from a Mayflower passenger; David being descended from Richard Warren, and Jane descended from Stephen Hopkins. By the age of 12, Ephraim spent most of his life at sea. This life continued for another 28 years, during which time he traded in the West Indies, Europe, and more. In 1810, he imported a cargo of merino sheep from Portugal to Sturdivant Island, which is now named after his family. He became the first person to bring merino sheep to the state of Maine. rightOn June 18, 1812, Ephraim received permission from President James Madison to command a schooner, the Reaper, as a privateer for the War of 1812. It is also known that he commanded the Ilsley during the same war. =Marriage and family= Ephraim's first marriage occurred on January 12, 1809, to Rachael Drinkwater. This union produced nine children: * Alvin Sturdivant * Henry Sturdivant His second marriage was to Dolly S. Taylor. His third and final marriage was to Mary Thaxter Greely. =Later life= Capt. Sturdivant served as the first treasurer of Cumberland from 1820 to 1832. He was also a selectman from 1833 to 1834. He died on either August 30 or the 31st from natural causes. =Legacy= Cumberland still exists to this day under the same name.

The green curve represents an ideal amplifier, in which the output power is equal to 3 times the input power. The red curve represents a typical amplifier, which can deliver the gain only up to a certain power level before it hits saturation. Gain compression is the difference between the green curve and the red curve. An important gain compression parameter is the OP1dB which is the power input that results in a 1 dB compression. For this example, the OP1dB is approximately 2 Watts because at that input power level, the green curve is at 6 Watts and the red curve is at approximately 5 Watts. The ratio of 5/6 is 83.3%, whereas a 1 dB loss is a ratio of 79.4% = (10^{-1/10}) Gain compression is a reduction in \\"differential\\" or \\"slope\\" gain caused by nonlinearity of the transfer function of the amplifying device. This nonlinearity may be caused by heat due to power dissipation or by overdriving the active device beyond its linear region. It is a large-signal phenomenon of circuits.  Relevance  Gain compression is relevant in any system with a wide dynamic range, such as audio or RF. It is more common in tube circuits than transistor circuits, due to topology differences, possibly causing the differences in audio performance called \\"valve sound\\". The front-end RF amps of radio receivers are particularly susceptible to this phenomenon when overloaded by a strong unwanted signal.  Audio effects  A tube radio or tube amplifier will increase in volume to a point, and then as the input signal extends beyond the linear range of the device, the effective gain is reduced, altering the shape of the waveform. The effect is also present in transistor circuits. The extent of the effect depends on the topology of the amplifier.  Differences between clipping and compression  Clipping, as a form of signal compression, differs from the operation of the typical studio audio level compressor, in which gain compression is not instantaneous (delayed in time via attack and release settings). Clipping destroys any audio information which is over a certain threshold. Compression and limiting, change the shape of the entire waveform, not just the shape of the waveform above the threshold. This is why it is possible to limit and compress with very high ratios without causing distortion. = Limiting or clipping = Gain is a linear operation. \\"Gain compression\\" is not linear and, as such, its effect is one of distortion, due to the nonlinearity of the transfer characteristic which also causes a loss of 'slope' or 'differential' gain. So the output is less than expected using the small signal gain of the amplifier. In clipping, the signal is abruptly limited to a certain amplitude and is thereby distorted in keeping under that level. This creates extra harmonics that are not present in the original signal. \\"Soft\\" clipping or limiting means there isn't a sharp \\"knee point\\" in the transfer characteristic. A sine wave that has been softly clipped will become more like a square wave, with more rounded edges, but will still have many extra harmonics. = Compression = Compression of gain is caused by non-linear characteristics of the device when run at large amplitudes. With any signal, as the input level is increased beyond the linear range of the amplifier, gain compression will occur. A transistor's operating point may move with temperature, so higher power output may lead to compression due to collector dissipation. But it's not a change in gain; it's non-linear distortion. The output level stays relatively the same as the input level goes higher. Once the non-linear portion of the transfer characteristic of any amplifier is reached, any increase in input will not be matched by a proportional increase in output. Thus there is compression of gain. Also, at this time because the transfer function is no longer linear, harmonic distortion will result.  Intentional compression  In intentional compression (sometimes called automatic gain control or audio level compression) as used in devices called 'dynamic range compressors', the overall gain of the circuit is actively changed in response to the level of the input over time, so the transfer function remains linear over a short period of time. A sine wave into such a system will still look like a sine wave at the output, but the overall gain is varied, depending on the level of that sine wave. Above a certain input level, the output sine wave will always be the same amplitude. The output level of Intentional compression varies over time, in order to minimize non linear behavior. With gain compression, the opposite is true, its output is constant. In this respect intentional compression serves less of an artistic purpose.  Radio-frequency compression  \\"Gain compression\\" in RF amplifiers is similar to soft clipping. However, in narrowband systems, the effect \\"looks\\" more like gain compression simply because the harmonics are filtered out after amplification. Many data sheets for RF amplifiers list gain compression rather than distortion figures because it's easier to measure and is more important than distortion figures in nonlinear RF amplifiers. In wideband and low-frequency systems, the nonlinear effects are readily visible, e.g. the output is clipped. To see the same thing at 1 GHz, an oscilloscope with a bandwidth of at least 10 GHz is needed. Observing with a spectrum analyzer, the fundamental compressed and the harmonics picking up. = Examples of RF compression = A low-noise RF amplifier, if fed by a directional antenna to a consumer 900 MHz receiver, should improve the transmission range. It works, but the receiver may also pick up a couple of UHF stations around 700 MHz. For example, if channel 54 is transmitting 6 MW of AM, FM, and PM, the RF front end, expecting ‚àí80 dBm, would be grossly overloaded and generate mixing products. This is a typical effect of gain compression.  High-power loudspeakers  Power compression is form of gain compression that takes place in loudspeaker voice coils when they heat up and increase their resistance. This causes less power to be drawn from the amplifier and a reduction in sound pressure level.

Alphonse is a child who lost his body during an alchemical experiment to bring his deceased mother back to life and had his soul attached to a suit of armor by his older brother Edward. As a result, Alphonse is almost invulnerable as long as the armor's seal is not erased, but is unable to feel anything. To recover their bodies, the Elrics travel around their country Amestris to obtain the Philosopher's Stonean alchemical object that could restore them. In the animated adaptations of Fullmetal Alchemist, Alphonse is voiced by Rie Kugimiya in Japanese. In the English adaptations, he is voiced by Aaron Dismuke in the first series and by Maxey Whitehead in the second. As a result of appearing in the series mostly in his armor, Arakawa has been focused on searching ways to make it appear as Alphonse is expressing emotions despite not having a body. Alphonse has also appeared in materials related to the manga, including video games and light novels that follow his journey. His character has been well received by readers of the series; he has consistently appeared in the top ten series' popularity polls. The character has received positive remarks from critics, with some commending his design and his relationship with Edward. Appearances Alphonse's original body. The author Hiromu Arakawa often makes sketches of him since he often appears in an armor. Alphonse is one of the protagonists from the series alongside his older brother Edward. Alphonse loses his entire body while he and Edward try to revive their mother Trisha using alchemy. Edward sacrifices his right arm to seal Alphonse's soul into a suit of armor. Edward later becomes an alchemist from the state military of Amestris, and starts traveling with Alphonse to search for a method to recover Alphonse's body. They seek the Philosopher's Stone, which would allow them to restore their physical forms. Besides being a powerful alchemist, Alphonse is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter; having been trained by Izumi Curtis. While Alphonse cannot feel anything because he has no body, he is nearly invincible as long as the blood mark made by Edward on his armor to contain his soul is not defaced. Believing that the immortal creatures known as the homunculi will lead them to more clues to recover their bodies, the Elrics try to use them. However, they meet the homunculi's creator \\"Father\\", who secretly controls the military and blackmails the Elrics into working under him. Seeking to protect their friends, the Elrics travel to the northern area of the country in order to request help from General Olivier Mira Armstrong. After the two are successful in their plan, Alphonse's original body tries to recover the soul resulting in him losing consciousness several times. Separated from his brother to assist his friends' escape from the military men serving Father, Alphonse is captured by the homunculus Pride to use him against Edward. Joining forces with his father Van Hohenheim, Alphonse traps Pride and himself within a cave where the homunculus remains powerless. State Alchemist Solf J. Kimblee later comes to Pride's aid, and Alphonse is rescued by some of his comrades. Seeking to transmute the whole country, Father transports the Elrics to his base to use them as two of the five sacrifices required to achieve his goal. At the same moment, Alphonse finds his original body, but refuses to recover it because its weakened state would not help them to fight the homunculi. In the final fight against Father, Alphonse requests help from the alchemist May Chang to return Edward's right arm in exchange for Alphonse's soul. As Edward, with his restored arm, fights Father, Alphonse's soul disappears from the armor. Following Father's defeat, Edward sacrifices his ability to use alchemy to restore Alphonse's soul and original body. The two return to Resembool, where they live until they decide to separate to study alchemy. Alphonse joins with two chimera comrades and they travel to the country of Xing to learn more alchemy with May's help. =In the first anime= The first half of the anime's plot follows that of the manga, but the plots severely diverge from each other near the middle of the story. After Kimblee uses alchemy to transform Alphonse's armor into explosive material, Scar transfers all of his incomplete Philosopher's Stone into Al to save his life. As a result, Alphonse's armor becomes the Philosopher's Stone. Because he houses the Stone in his body, he becomes the primary target of the homunculi's leader Dante, who is trying to cheat death. Once captured by the homunculi for Dante, Al is to be eaten by Gluttony to complete the Stone inside Gluttony's body. But when he sees his brother killed trying to save him, Al uses the stone's power to heal Edward's body and re- bind his soul to it. This destroys Alphonse's own body as he uses up the whole of the Philosopher's Stone in the transmutations. Then Edward, using his own body, resurrects Alphonse. As a result, Edward disappears and Alphonse continues studying alchemy to find him. In the film sequel Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa, Alphonse continues searching for his brother until learning that he is in a parallel world. With help from the homunculus Wrath, Alphonse opens the gate to the parallel world, but at the same time causes a soldier named Dietline Eckhart, who is from the parallel world, to start attacking Amestris. Joining forces with Edward, Alphonse defeats Eckhart and decides to stay with his brother to live in the parallel world. =In other media= Aside from the initial anime and manga, Alphonse appears in almost all the Fullmetal Alchemist original video animations (OVAs). In the first one, he appears as a chibi version of himself at the movie's wrap-up party, and in the fourth OVA, he plays a part in the battle against the homunculi. Alphonse also appears in all Fullmetal Alchemist video games on all platforms, which feature his and Ed's journey to find the Philosopher's Stone. In the film The Sacred Star of Milos Alphonse goes with his brother to search for the criminal Melvin Voyager who broke free from a prison in their country. Makoto Inoue's Fullmetal Alchemist light novels also feature the Elrics' journey, but in all of them they encounter different characters to those from the video games. Two character CDs with tracks based on Alphonse were released under the name of and Theme of Alphonse Elric. The tracks from the CD are performed by Alphone's Japanese voice actress, Rie Kugimiya. He is also featured in several of the Fullmetal Alchemist Trading Card Games. Creation and conception In a prototype from the series, Alphonse's soul was sealed in a flying squirrel instead of armor as a result of human transmutation. He appeared as the father to the other protagonist, Edward, in their searching for a way to recover their bodies. To match the designs from the manga magazine Monthly Sh≈çnen Gangan, the two characters were redesigned. Alphonse was given a huge suit of armor to contrast him with Edward's short stature. Since Alphonse mostly appears with his armor, Arakawa tends to make sketches of his human form so that she would not forget how to draw him. Some events from the Elrics' lives are social problems she integrated into the plot. Their journey across the country to help people is meant to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. As Alphonse is mostly seen with his armor, during various chapters from the manga Arakawa was unable to draw him crying. During Chapter 40, Arakawa saw his conversation with Edward as a way to let him express his feeling and to make him appear as though he is crying. When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences in the same way as other alchemists appearing in the series. When making omakes, Arakawa tends to draw Alphonse doing something comical to contrast him with the other characters. She states that she does it because Alphonse may enjoy making fun of other people. In the Japanese animated adaptations of Fullmetal Alchemist, Alphonse was voiced by Rie Kugimiya. For the English version, Aaron Dismuke took the role for the first anime, Conqueror of Shamballa and some of the OVAs. He has found Alphonse to be his favorite character, and likes the way he \\"sticks up for people\\". He also said that he tries to be like Alphonse when voicing him, though he added, \\"I don't really see a lot of myself in him\\". In Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Dismuke was replaced by Maxey Whitehead, as Dismuke's voice had changed with age. For the live-action film, Alphonse's armor was made in CGI. Arakawa herself expressed surprise when seeing the final product. Reception In popularity polls from the manga made by Monthly Sh≈çnen Gangan, Alphonse was initially ranked in the third place, while later polls placed him fourth. He has also been highly ranked in the Animages Anime Grand Prix polls in the category of best male characters in both 2004. Merchandise based on Alphonse's appearance, including figurines, keychains and plush toys, has been marketed. UGO Networks listed one of his statues tenth in their article of \\"Insanely Expensive Comic Book Collectibles We'd Blow Our Wad On.\\" Several publications for manga, anime, and other pop culture media have both praised and criticized Alphonse's character. Chis Beveridge from Mania Entertainment has praised Alphonse for being \\"quite the likeable character\\" and liked his role in the first series. The character's madness and disbelief over his own existence has been praised; Beveridge said it \\"could make up a series all by itself..\\" In a later volume review, Beveridge said the series' change of focus to Alphonse \\"as an actual young boy\\" was \\"a nice change of pace.\\" T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews' Samuel Arbogast wrote that the interaction between the Elric brothers as they travel is interesting and that Alphonse's armor was of the most notable characters designs from the series. The brothers were also noted to \\"becoming men\\" by Active's Anime Holly Ellingwood after the first appearance of Van Hohenheim in the manga as the two investigate ways to recover their bodies. Lydia Hojnacki said Alphonse's character is as important as his brother to the series after commenting on Edward as she considered Alphonse to be Edward's yang. Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised Alphonse's development in the manga, especially where he refuses to recover his weakened body and instead helps his friends. As a result, Silverman brought a comparison between the two brothers and wondered whether Edward would have done the same. Chris Beveridge found the character's growth in Conqueror in Shamballa appealing as he starts visually resembling Edward. When reviewing the video game Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel, RPGFan's Neal Chandran enjoyed the dynamic between the main characters both in fights as well as dialogues. After Aaron Dismuke's voice matured, Anime News Network writer Justin Sevakis criticized him for his part in the Fullmetal Alchemist: Premium OVA Collection, writing that \\"he simply no longer sounds like Alphonse\\".

It derived its name from the nearby town of Frankford, Philadelphia County. The stream originates as Tookany Creek at Hill Crest in Cheltenham Township and meanders eastward, then southeastward, throughout Cheltenham Township, until a sharp bend near the Philadelphia border at Lawncrest, where the place names Toxony and Tookany were used in historic times; the stream is still known as Tookany Creek in this region, where it flows southwest. Turning south into Philadelphia at the crotch of Philadelphia's V-shaped border, the creek is called Tacony Creek; from here southward, it is considered the informal boundary separating Northeast Philadelphia from the rest of the city. The Philadelphia neighborhoods of Olney and Feltonville lie on the western side of the stream in this area while Northwood, Lawncrest, Summerdale, and Frankford lie on the eastern side. It continues to be called the Tacony at least until the smaller Wingohocking Creek merges with it in Juniata Park, within the city-owned golf course. Beyond Castor Avenue it is known as Frankford Creek until the stream's confluence with the Delaware River in the Bridesburg neighborhood of Philadelphia. The section of stream known as Frankford Creek is long, and the upstream section known as Tacony Creek, from Hill Crest, is long.U.S. Geological Survey.

Sewerization and diversion Portions of its tributary Wingohocking Creek were converted to sewers between 1905 and 1915. In 1934, the horseshoe bend between Bridge and Margaret Streets (where the creek formed part of the boundary between the Frankford and Bridesburg neighborhoods) was removed as a new straight channel was cut. In 1949, the creek's path through Frankford was straightened as two horseshoe bends were removed in the vicinity of the intersection of Wyoming and Castor Avenues. An arch structure, the remains of a bridge carrying Wyoming Avenue over one of the removed bends in the creek, is visible from park level (approximately 15 ft (5m) below Wyoming Ave.). A bridge railing along the sidewalk still exists in this location, across from Eastern Regional Medical Center of Cancer Treatment Centers of America (formerly Parkview Hospital). Downstream from Castor Avenue, the creek now flows through a concrete culvert. In 1956 the creek was diverted to meet the Delaware River at a more southerly point, cutting off its natural bed that curved around Bridesburg along the Frankford Arsenal. Part of that bed was filled, but much of the old creek remains, near its original mouth on the Delaware. Frankford Creek has been converted to storm sewers along much of its course, as this map shows. Historic bridges Glenside. Mill Rd Bridge (1930) over Tookany Creek in Elkins Park.

Name origins=Wingohocking Creek= Frankford Creek is formed by the union of three streams. One of these, now known as Wingohocking Creek, is so called in a patent to Griffith Jones, 1684. It is called Winconico in a patent to John Goodson, 1701, and Wincokoe in a patent to Griffith Jones of the same year. Wingohocking is defined by Heckewelder to be \\"a choice spot of land for cultivation, a favorite place for planting, fine land;\\" whilst Mr. Henry says it means \\"lands in a hollow or valley.\\" In modern times, the Wingohocking has been called \\"Logan's Run\\", from the fact that it flowed through the grounds of the seat of James Logan at Stenton. The Wingohocking rises near Mount Airy, curves generally to the south, and passing through Germantown runs eastwardly until it unites with Tacony Creek near Rowland's saw-mill. =Tookany Creek= Tookany Creek rises in Montgomery County near Shoemakertown, runs south-west and south, crosses the line of the former Bristol township, and formed the boundary of Bristol and Oxford townships. Rock Run enters Tookany Creek southwest of what was formerly Whitaker's factory. The Little Tacony rises near the Township-line Road between Dublin and Oxford, runs nearly south through Oxford township, and is joined by one or two brooks, and empties into Frankford Creek east of Frankford. The stream is now called Frankford Creek from the junction of Tacony and Wingohocking creeks, and enters the Delaware near the U.S. Arsenal. Tacony is called Taoconik in a patent to Robert Adams, 1684; Toaconinck in a patent to Griffith Jones in the same year; and Toaconinck Township is referenced on Thomas Holme's 1687 survey map.Holme's 1687 Survey Map of Pennsylvania Little Tacony is also called Tackawanna. Mr. Henry says Tacony is derived from Tekene and means \\"woods\\" or \\"an uninhabited place.\\" =Others= Into Frankford Creek near the Delaware empties a stream called Freaheatah. Frankford Creek derives its name from the village of Frankford, adjoining. On Lindstrom's map it is called \\"Aleskins Kylen\\", La Riviere des Anguilles Ecorchees (meaning \\"the river of skinned eels\\"), the origin of which can only be conjectured. A portion of the creek east of the junction of the Little Tacony is called Questioninck in a patent to Eric Cock and others, and Quissinuaminck in a patent to Thomas Fairman, 1688. :\\"Changes in the Names of Streams In and About Philadelphia\\".

LSZH cable jacketing is composed of thermoplastic or thermoset compounds that emit limited smoke and no halogen when exposed to high sources of heat.MSS Fibre Glossary of Terms  Description  The first commercial thermoplastic LSZH material for cable jacketing was invented by Richard Skipper in 1979 and patented by Raychem Corporation.United States Patent 4322575 This invention resolved the challenge of incorporating sufficient inorganic filler, aluminium trihydrate (ALTH), into an appropriate thermoplastic matrix to suppress the fire and allow a char to be formed, which reduced emission of poisonous carbon gases and also smoke and carbon particles, whilst maintaining electrical insulation properties and physical properties required by the end application. The preferred inorganic filler to achieve flame retardation continues to be aluminium trihydrate (ALTH). In the event of a fire this material undergoes an endothermic chemical reaction that absorbs heat energy and releases steam when the compound reaches a certain temperature. It is critical that the decomposition of the polymer(s) used to carry the filler happens at approximately the same temperature. The steam disrupts combustion of the evolved gases and helps form a char layer that protects the remaining material and traps particulates. The high level of filler required (‚âà 60%) also replaces the base polymer reducing the total amount of fuel available for combustion. Low smoke zero halogen cable considerably reduces the amount of toxic and corrosive gas emitted during combustion. When burned, a low-smoke zero halogen cable emits a less optically dense smoke that releases at a lower rate. During a fire, a low-smoke cable is desirable because it reduces the amount and density of the smoke, which makes exiting a space easier for occupants as well as increases the safety of firefighting operations. This type of material is typically used in poorly ventilated areas such as aircraft, rail carriages, tanks, subsea and offshore installations, submarines or ships. It is also used extensively in the rail industry, wherever high voltage or track signal wires must be run into and through tunnel systems. The nuclear industry is another area where LSZH cables have been and will be used in the future. Major cable manufacturers have been producing LSZH cables for nuclear facilities since the early 1990s. Construction of new nuclear plants will almost certainly involve extensive use of LSZH cable. This will reduce the chance of toxic gases accumulating in those areas where personnel are working and the lack of corrosive gases where there are computer controlled systems will reduce the possibility of wires being damaged by fire resulting in a short circuit fault. Since the 1970s, the wire and cable industry has been using low-smoke, low-halogen materials in a number of applications. The introduction of a thermoplastic LSZH extended its use to accessories such as heat shrink tubing, labelling and fixtures. The objective was to create a wire and cable jacketing system that was not only flame retardant but also did not generate dense, obscuring smoke and less toxic or corrosive gases. In the military field its introduction was accelerated after 1982 following the dense black smoke emitted from HMS Sheffield after being hit by an exocet missile in the Falklands war. Several fires, such as the King's Cross fire in London that killed 31 people in London's underground in 1987, increased the awareness of the contribution that wire and cable jacketing makes in a fire. As a result, there has been an increased use of LSZH cables. With an increase in the amount of cable found in residential, commercial and industrial applications in recent years, there is a greater fuel load in the event of a fire and LSZH systems have a major role to play in protecting the public. Several standards describe the processes used for measuring smoke output during combustion. For military applications Def Stan 02-711 in the UK and ASTM E662 in the US which are both based on an ASTM STP No. 422 pages 166-204, 1967 modified by AMTE, Portsmouth in the UKA new approach to testing materials in the NBS smoke chamber, A. Routley and R. Skipper Fire and Materials Volume 4, Issue 2 June 1980 Pages 98‚Äì103 and superseded by E662 in the US. During these tests a specified material sample is standardised and then exposed to a radiant heat source; the optical density of the smoke given off is photometrically measured. There are various means of measuring optical density: peak smoke release rate, total smoke released, and smoke density at various points and durations during the test. Results must be below a certain value and the material must pass the burn test in order for the material to be labelled as low smoke. These tests are conducted under laboratory conditions and cannot claim to replicate the range of conditions expected in a real fire scenario. However they do provide a measure by which the potential smoke emission of materials can be assessed and dangerous materials identified before proceeding to further testing of preferred materials, if deemed necessary.

Carruthers (September 27, 1930 ‚Äì March 2, 2003) was an American television executive who gained his first fame as the director of The Soupy Sales Show at Detroit television station WXYZ-TV. He also directed the Ernie Kovacs-helmed game show, Take a Good Look, for ABC from 1959 to 1961. Carruthers was born in Detroit, Michigan. He served in the Air Force for four years, and after serving, he took up a job at Detroit ABC O & O (Owned and Operated) WXYZ-TV. One day, he showed up to the station to work when he was told at the last minute, the regular director was unable to direct The Soupy Sales Show, he stepped in to direct the show. He was named the permanent director, and moved with his family to Los Angeles in 1959 upon the show becoming nationally distributed. He went on to be the director on The Newlywed Game and The Dating Game before starting his own production company in 1968. His company, The William Carruthers Company, produced the ABC country music series The Johnny Cash Show in 1969 with his partner Joel Stein for Screen Gems. He also produced and directed game shows including Give-n-Take, The Neighbors, Second Chance (all with Warner Bros. Television), Lee Trevino's Golf for Swingers (with advertising agency McCann Erickson) and the 1975 version of You Don't Say! (with Ralph Andrews Productions and Warner Bros. Television), before hitting it big with the CBS game show, Press Your Luck (which was a retooling of the earlier Second Chance), which ran from 1983‚Äì86. He was the voice for the multiple Whammy animations on the show. In the 1990s, he produced specials for The Family Channel, called Marry Me, as well as a short-lived game show for ESPN, Designated Hitter. He suffered a stroke on set in 1996. This led to his retirement, which eventually led to his death from heart failure in 2003. Two weeks after his death, Game Show Network aired a documentary called Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal about a contestant on the Carruthers co-created Press Your Luck named Michael Larson. The documentary detailed how Larson created a method that allowed him to win a record-breaking sum of over $100,000 on the game show. Carruthers was interviewed for the program, which marked his last appearance before his death. The original airing of the documentary was dedicated in his memory. Today, the rights to the Press Your Luck format are owned by the British multi-national media company Fremantle.

He inherited the title of despot (as an heir to the throne now under occupation of the Ottoman Empire), by King Matthias Corvinus, and ruled most of present- day Vojvodina, under the overlordship of the Kingdom of Hungary. He is known in Serbian epic poetry for his valour and heroism, and is called Vuk the Fiery Dragon ( / Zmaj Ognjeni Vuk), Vuk the Dragon-Despot, or simply the Dragon; he commanded the Hungarian army (Black Army) in several of its battles against the Ottomans. He is considered the founder of Grgeteg monastery. Life Vuk was the son of Grgur Brankoviƒá, and a grandson of despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá and Eirene Kantakouzene. His father Grgur was blinded by the Ottomans in 1441. With the fall of Serbian Despotate in 1459, at first, Vuk Grgureviƒá was an Ottoman vassal, but in 1465, he acceded into the service of Matthias Corvinus and became commander of Serb military squads in Syrmia. Vuk acquired a great reputation for bravery, and gained the nickname \\"Zmaj Ognjeni\\", which translates to \\"Fiery Dragon\\". His name \\"Vuk\\" means \\"wolf\\" in Serbian so his nickname, \\"Zmaj Ognjeni Vuk\\", actually means \\"Fiery Dragon Wolf\\". He is a hero in many Serbian epic songs. Grgeteg monastery was founded by Vuk Grgureviƒá He fought for the Hungarians against Czechs, Poles, Austrians and Turks. In 1471 he gained a title of the despot of Serbia, and also gained large possessions in present-day Vojvodina, which formerly belonged to despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. Among his possessions were Slankamen, Kupinovo, Zrenjanin, Berkasovo, Irig, Vr≈°ac, etc. His most famous military forays were those in 1476, when he seized Srebrenica and fought near ≈†abac and Smederevo, and in 1480, when he attacked Sarajevo. In 1479, along with Dmitar Jak≈°iƒá, he led Serbian light cavalry squadrons in Battle of Breadfield, near Zsib√≥t. At the decisive moment in battle Hungarian and Serbian hussars charged the Ottoman centre and broke their ranks, which decided the outcome of the battle. In 1481, he fought against Turks in Serbia, and brought from there (area around Kru≈°evac) about 50,000 people, who were settled in Banat, mostly around Timi»ôoara. Vuk worked together with alias Dojƒçin Petar, which demonstrates in some of his letters. An inheritance was suspected centuries later. Imperial censorship caused every copy of the 1808 issue of the Almanach de Gotha to be seized and destroyed.

McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is one of twelve constituent schools at Northwestern University. Most engineering classes are held in the Technological Institute (1942), which students commonly refer to as \\"Tech.\\" In October 2005, another building affiliated with the School, the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center, opened.  History  The trustees of Northwestern University founded a College of Technology in June 1873, but in his report for 1876-77, President Oliver Marcy announced that the new college had failed for lack of financial resources to develop the faculty and facilities. In 1891, President Henry Wade Rogers called for the founding of a new Engineering School, stating that universities in general were ‚Äúnot performing the work necessary to prepare men for the various activities of modern life, so different from the life their fathers lived half a century ago.‚Äù This was realized in 1909, when the new College of Engineering was opened in Swift Hall. Operationally, the Engineering School until the mid-1920s was a department of the College of Liberal Arts. The major emphasis was on a broad general education with a particular stress on mathematics and science. In 1937, the Engineering School ran into difficulties with the American Engineers' Council for Professional Development, which denied the School accreditation. In response, a four-year curriculum satisfying the ECPD was put into place. In 1939, Walter Patton Murphy (1873‚Äì1942), a wealthy inventor of railroad equipment, donated $6.735 million to the School of Engineering. Murphy meant for the Institute to offer a ‚Äúcooperative‚Äù education, whereby academic courses and practical application in industrial settings were closely integrated. In 1942, Northwestern received an additional bequest of $28 million from Murphy's estate to provide for an engineering school \\"second to none.\\" A cooperative education program was designed in the late 1930s by Charles F. Kettering, former research head of General Motors, and Herman Schneider, dean of the engineering school at the University of Cincinnati. The program required undergraduates to work outside the classroom in technical positions for several terms over the course of their college years. =Campus= Lakefill Most engineering classes are held in the Northwestern Technological Institute building, which students refer to as \\"Tech.\\" Ground was broken for the new building on April 1, 1940 and the building was dedicated on June 15‚Äì16, 1942. The building was designed in the shape of two letter E's, placed back to back and joined by a central structure. Each of the six original departments used one of the wings. When it was built it was the largest building on Northwestern's Evanston campus.  Curriculum  a faculty of 180 taught 1450 undergraduates. In 1996, Northwestern University launched an engineering program called Engineering Design and Communication (EDC), which is a mandatory class for all undergraduate engineering students. EDC consists of two quarter-long classes that focus on design and communication within the Engineering discipline. Each EDC class has 16 students who are team-taught by one professor from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and one professor from the Writing Program of the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. EDC classes typically work with the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago or other local non-profit organizations. The EDC program was renamed Design Thinking and Communication, or DTC, beginning with the 2012-2013 school year. The Engineering Analysis program is also mandatory for all undergraduate engineering students and consists of four quarter-long classes. These classes provide the basis for Northwestern's engineering curriculum, and teach linear algebra, statics and dynamics, system dynamics, and differential equations. In addition, students become familiar with the computer programming language MATLAB. The graduate curriculum includes MMM, a joint degree program by Kellogg School of Management which offers MBA, and McCormick which offers MSDI, Master of Science in Design Innovation. Historically, McCormick offered MEM for MMM graduates. =Co-op Program= The Walter P. Murphy Cooperative Engineering Education Program at Northwestern. Students work at a paid internship with one company for 3-6 academic quarters spread out throughout the students' undergraduate careers, including at least one period of two consecutive quarters. While participating in the co-op program, students maintain full-time student status.

He was also the son of triple Olympic gold medal winner John B. Kelly Sr., and the elder brother of the actress and Princess of Monaco, Grace Kelly. In 1947, Kelly was awarded the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Early life and family Kelly in 1945 Kelly was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the second child and only son of John Kelly Sr. and his wife, the former Margaret Katherine Majer. His paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants, with his grandfather being from County Mayo, Ireland. John Sr. was the son of a farmer; he started his own bricklaying business, \\"Kelly for Brickwork\\", and became a multimillionaire. Margaret's parents were Germans who emigrated to the United States. Before her marriage, she was a model and competitive swimmer. She converted from Protestantism to Roman Catholicism to marry Jack Kelly. Kelly's uncle George Kelly was a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright. Kelly had an older sister Margaret (born September 1925 and nicknamed \\"Peggy\\") and two younger sisters, Grace (born November 1929) and Elizabeth Anne (born June 1933 and nicknamed \\"Lizanne\\"). Kelly's younger sister Grace would go on to become an Academy Award winning film actress who married Rainier III, Prince of Monaco in 1956. Kelly's nephew is Monaco's current monarch Prince Albert II. The children were raised in a 17-room house on Henry Avenue in East Falls, Philadelphia Kelly served in the United States Navy during World War II. He was stationed in Bainbridge, Maryland.

Kelly Sr. won two gold medals at the 1920 Summer Olympics, capturing both the single scull (1x) and the double scull (2x). The senior Kelly repeated his victory in the double scull at the 1924 Summer Olympics. In 1920, despite his accomplishments as an rower, the senior Kelly's entry was rejected at the then most prestigious rowing event in the world, the Henley Royal Regatta. According to the minutes of the regatta's Committee of Management, Kelly was excluded for two reasons: first, because having worked as a bricklayer he was not eligible under the regatta's then rules on amateurism (which excluded anyone \\"...who is or ever has been ‚Ä¶ by trade or employment for wages a mechanic, artisan or labourer\\") and second because he was a member of Vesper Boat Club which was banned in 1906 after members of their 1905 crew raised money through a public subscription to pay for their travel expenses.New York Times, June 25, 1906 Kelly's exclusion was widely reported in newspapers in both the UK and US, with many seeing it as an attempt to prevent an American from winning the prestigious Diamond Challenge Sculls event although an American, Edward Ten Eyck, had previously won the event in 1897. In 1947, Kelly Jr. won the Diamond Challenge Sculls (single scull) at the Henley, the event from which his father had been excluded. In recognition of his accomplishment, Kelly was awarded the 1947 James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. In 1949 Kelly repeated his feat and again won the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley. In 1980, Kelly's sister Princess Grace of Monaco was invited to present the trophies at the Regatta. In 2003, the Princess Grace Challenge Cup named in her honour was first presented.

Kelly won his opening heat, but did not make the finals after finishing second to eventual Silver Medalist Eduardo Risso in the semi-finals. (Due to course width constrictions, the Henley course could only handle a 3 boat final). At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Kelly again won his opening heat. In the semi-final, which was one to qualify, Kelly finished second to eventual champion Yuriy Tyukalov, and Kelly was relegated to the repechage, or second-chance race, which was also one to qualify for the final. In the repechage, Kelly's main competitor was Teodor Kocerka of Poland. They fought all the way down the course with Kocerka, who would go on to win the Bronze medal, prevailing in a close finish. At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Kelly won his Olympic medal, a bronze. He was beaten by two teenage prodigies, Vyacheslav Ivanov of Russia and Stuart MacKenzie of Australia, but Kelly beat Teodor Kocerka, who had beaten Kelly four years earlier. Kelly gave the medal to his sister Grace, who married Prince Rainier earlier that year, as a wedding present. He would later quip that he had hoped it would have been a different color. In 1960, Kelly competed in the double scull at his final Olympics in Rome. His boat would be eliminated in the repechage. =Later career in sports= In 1964, following his retirement from rowing, Kelly acted as manager for the United States Olympic 8-man boat. It was composed of rowers from the Vesper Boat Club, to which Kelly also belonged. That boat won a Gold Medal at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. In 1968, Kelly served as a member of the national committee for the Modern pentathlon. Kelly became a passionate advocate for athletes. He was elected president of the Amateur Athletic Union in 1970 and stirred controversy by arguing that the amateur code had become outmoded, thereby helping free the Olympics from sham amateurism. In 1974, Kelly headed a group of Philadelphia business men who became owners of the Philadelphia Bell a franchise in the now defunct World Football League. Kelly's name and connection were important in giving the franchise legitimacy and in negotiating agreements with the city of Philadelphia. However, as the first season progressed, Kelly stepped aside as the team president in favor of John Bosacco who owned a controlling interest in the franchise. In February 1985, Kelly was elected president of the United States Olympic Committee. The appointment was short-lived ‚Äì Kelly died three weeks later. Kelly was posthumously inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame as a contributor. Kelly and his father are the only parent-child duo in the Olympic Hall of Fame. Business and professional life Kelly was a respected businessperson as owner of \\"Kelly for Brickwork\\", a company started by his father, John B. Kelly Sr. Kelly was actively involved in politics and served for 12 years as City Councilman-At-Large in Philadelphia (D). Kelly also served on the Fairmount Park Commission. For many years, Kelly played the role of George Washington in the annual Christmas Day re-enactment of the famous 1776 crossing of the Delaware River. The re-enactors would cross over from Pennsylvania to New Jersey on Christmas afternoon. Personal life Kelly's first wife was Mary Gray Freeman (now known as Mary Spitzer), the daughter of Monroe Edward and Christine Gray, the 1951 national women's champion in swimming and a member of the United States swimming team for the 1952 Olympics at Helsinki (she appeared on the cover of Life on July 23, 1951). They married in 1954 and had six children, including John B. Kelly III, Susan von Medicus, and Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Kelly.Taraborrelli 2003 p.340 After Kelly and his wife separated in 1969, Jack was well known as a man-about-town and dated many women, including Rachel Harlow, a transgender woman. He served as Philadelphia City Councilman-at-Large from 1967 to 1979. Kelly and Freeman finally divorced in 1980. Following his divorce, Kelly married Sandra Lee Worley, a banker, on May 28, 1981. The daughter of Chief Warrant Officer Russell Edwin and Laura Kristine Worley. They remained married until Kelly's death in 1985. Death On the morning of March 2, 1985, Kelly suffered a fatal heart attack while jogging to The Athletic Club in Philadelphia after his customary morning row on the Schuylkill River. His body was discovered on 18th and Callowhill Street shortly after 9:30 am. Kelly was taken to Hahnemann University Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Jack Kelly Jr.'s private funeral was held in Philadelphia. Among the attendees were his brother-in-law Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, his nieces Princess Caroline and Princess St√©phanie, his nephew the-then Prince Albert, then Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode and former Philadelphia mayors William J. Green, III and Frank Rizzo. John Kelly Jr. is buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania.

The tunnel is used by the Expo Line of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system. It is located downtown and has Burrard and Granville stations built within the tunnel. The western tunnel portal is located midway between Waterfront and Burrard stations, while the eastern portal is adjacent to Stadium‚ÄìChinatown station. History The tunnel was originally built by the Northern Construction Company in 1932 connecting the Canadian Pacific Railway railyards on Burrard Inlet and False Creek at a cost of $1.6 million. The tunnel's original east portal was located further south than the current portal, easing trains into the False Creek yards on a gentle southward curve. It was clearly visible until about 2005, where it was almost completely hidden next to an outdoor storage area behind the Costco. The original portal was destroyed in 2011 to make way for a new development, but there remains an abandoned section of tunnel, unused by SkyTrain. The tunnel was taken over by BC Transit in the early 1980s when the SkyTrain system was built in conjunction with Expo 86. Because the tunnel is only wide enough to accommodate a single railway track but with sufficiently high clearance, a superstructure was built inside the tunnel to carry the westbound SkyTrain track above the eastbound track. This results in the two stations within the tunnel having a split platform configuration.

Wizards are considered to be spellcasters who wield powerful spells, but are often physically weak as a trade-off. Wizards are commonly confused with similar offensive spellcasting classes such as the Warlock and the Necromancer. However, a Wizard's power is based on the arcane and a Warlock or Necromancer's power is based on darkness or death. Some exceptions exist as to Necromancers being different than Wizards, as in Dungeons And Dragons, Necromancer is a subclass of Wizard. Wizards are primarily based on wizards from assorted fantasy literature. Other terms used to describe the classification include Mage, Magician, and Magic User. Dungeons & Dragons The Dungeons & Dragons pen-and-paper franchise has three base character classes, with access to \\"arcane magic\\", that could be considered wizards: =Wizard= The wizard is a \\"genius student\\" of arcane magic, who has studied the subject for years. He practices until he is able to command magic with ease. The wizard must prepare spells daily. In early editions of the game, they were called 'magic-users'. =Sorcerer= The sorcerer is a \\"natural prodigy\\" arcanist, who usually claims dragon or fey ancestry as the source of his magical power. The sorcerer knows a limited number of spells, but does not need to prepare the spells daily. The sorcerer is able to cast more spells per day than a wizard of a comparable level. =Warlock= The Warlock is a \\"darkened soul\\" arcanist, who creates \\"Pacts\\" with powerful creatures to harness their innate magical gift, and perform spell-like feats and abilities. Since they are not users of true spells in the traditional sense, they can use their invocations while wearing armor. Designs of a Diabolist =Other= There are many other prestige classes related to the wizard concept, such as the Archmage and Mystic Theurge. Fire Emblem In the turn-based Fire Emblem game series, Mages are units who cast spells in order to damage an enemy. Players can promote the Mages into Sages. Mages and Sages have higher magic-resistance growths and caps, as well as above average speed. However, they almost always have poor growth in defense which makes them vulnerable to magic-resistant melee units. Final Fantasy series The wizards of the Final Fantasy series are usually known as simply mages, often with an associated color. There are multiple types of mages: *Black Mages, mages who practice offensive magic. *Blue Mages, mages who copy enemy abilities. *Red Mages, mages who are jacks-of-all-trades. *Summoners, mages who conjure up sacred beasts and deities. *Time Mages, mages who manipulate time and space. *White Mages, mages who practice healing magic. *Green Mages, mages who practice Green Magic, which enhances allies' abilities and weakens enemies. In the original Final Fantasy, the Black, Red and White Mages would be converted to more powerful Black, Red, and White Wizards, respectively. Additionally, in the MMORPG Final Fantasy XI, \\"wizard\\" is synonymous for Black Mage. Also, in Final Fantasy Tactics, Black Mages were known as Wizards in the PlayStation version of the game. Other Final Fantasy series featured Green Mages, mainly in the Tactics titles, but some of their abilities were merged with Black Mages or White Mages (offensive and defensive abilities respectively). World of Warcraft Wizards in World of Warcraft, called mages, are spell-casting characters designed to deal damage, while also preventing monsters from dealing damage and providing utility for the rest of their party. The three types of magic that mages can use are fire, frost, and arcane. Fire has a high damage output with little defense power. Frost spells typically slow down a target and are capable of high burst damage and offer more defense than fire. Arcane magic offers more utility and increases damage to all three types of magic. Arcane also increases resistance greatly, mana regain, intellect, and decreases the mana cost of spells. In return for their ability to deal larger amounts of damage, mages are very poor at physical combat. They wear the weakest armor (cloth), and they have no ability to heal themselves without the use of their potions or bandages. Another form of wizard in WoW is the Warlock, a spell-caster that uses fire and shadow magic against their enemies. Warlocks are also known for their ability to command demonic minions. Warlocks, depending on the player's style, specialize in damage-over-time spells (affliction), burst damage (destruction), and the use of their minions (demonology). Warlocks are able to regain mana at the cost of their own health, as well as drain health from their enemies. Druids are another type of wizard, capable of transformation, healing, and casting spells. They mostly deal physical damage, nature damage, or arcane damage. Depending on the style of the druid, they can be any type of character, a fighter, tank, or healer. If the druid uses Restoration, they have healing abilities. When they use feral combat, they are stronger in melee combat, and gain the power of a warrior (bear) and the skill of a rogue (cat). While in normal caster or \\"Moonkin\\" form, they are like a slightly weaker (but better armoured) version of a mage, dealing arcane and nature damage, and able to summon minions. Druids also have an advantage in combat with the use of travel form, cat form, aqua form, and even air form. Ragnarok Online In the Ragnarok Online MMORPG, \\"Magicians\\" who acquire enough experience are given the choice of becoming a \\"Wizard\\". Wizards are powerful spell-casters and have access to a wide array of area of effect spells, including \\"Storm Gust\\", \\"Meteor Storm\\" and \\"Lord of Vermilion\\". However, they have very few hit points, poor evasion capabilities and wear very weak armour. As such, most of the wizards require the support of a \\"Priest\\" and/or other party members. Avalon: The Legend Lives Avalon: The Legend Lives released in 1989 is an on-line text based multi-player role playing game notable for being the first to introduce fully developed professions and skills as well as pioneering many features that have since become signature components of the roleplaying computer game genre. One of its founding professions was that of the mage a wielder of rituals, candescent light magic, charms or spoken spells. Richard Bartle described Avalon's magic system as complex. Avalon currently hosts four incarnations of wizard, mage, warlock and enchanter across its four player driven cities. Other games * In The Bard's Tale, the wizard was only available as a class change from another magic-user class. The wizard class was the most advanced class level, with the character needing to master the third level of spells from at least two other magic-user classes. * In The Elder Scrolls series, there are many character class templates related to the concept of wizards, such as \\"mage,\\" \\"sorcerer,\\" \\"battlemage,\\" \\"necromancer\\" and \\"nightblade.\\" * In Demon's Souls, there are two types of character classes that associate with magic, the Sorcerer and Royalty class dealing with standard magic. In Dark Souls, another branch of magic called Pyromancy has been added and the starting class that utilizes in this branch of magic is a Pyromancer. * In Lineage II, Mage is one of the character choices available to each race but dwarf, and Wizard is a class choice for the Human Mage's first class transfer. * In Avalon: The Legend Lives. , wizards are known as Mages and bring to bear a blend of magical, elemental and musical abilities on the battlefield. * In MapleStory, Magician is one of the 1st jobs available for players, on their 2nd job advancement they are called Wizards, on the 3rd - Mages and on the 4th - Arch Mages, or can choose to gain religious powers in which case their 2nd job advancement is Cleric, the 3rd - Priest, and 4th - Bishop. * In RuneScape, a Mage or Wizard is a character class that a person with a high magic level may wish to pick. Mage clothes, consisting of a wizard hat, tunic, cape, staff and legs are available for purchase. Wizards also appear as NPCs on this game, usually following an element or a deity. * In the parody game Kingdom of Loathing, wizards are available as \\"Pastamancers\\" (a play on the sometimes large variety of \\"-mancers\\" available in other games, e.g. 'necromancer', 'pyromancer', 'geomancer', &c.;) and \\"Saucerors\\" (a play on Sorcerers). They are jointly known as the \\"Chef Magi.\\" * In Guild Wars, Elementalists fill the role as wizards, focusing on fire, air, water and earth spells. * Diablo, Diablo II, Diablo II: Lord of Destructionand Diablo III all contain a form of wizard: in the first game, the sorcerer, in the second game and expansion, the sorceress and in the third game, the wizard. * Warhammer Online presents the Bright Wizard, the master of the arcane fire known as Aqshy. * Last Chaos features mage as a class that deals heavy damage from a distance and sorcerer as a kind of a magic-user class that can use elemental magic skills and summon elemental spirits to aid in battle. ArchLord makes a similar distinction, with mages wielding ranged direct-damage attacks often targeting an area, and elementalists capable of single target attacks and the summoning of pets that buff, heal, debuff or tank. *In Heroes of the Storm, various mage characters who appear in the Warcraft and Diablo franchises are playable heroes in this game. * In Nox, there are Wizard and Conjurer classes. The Wizard has a variety of attack and utility spells including teleportation effects, invisibility and invulnerability. The Conjurer specializes in summoning creatures to fight. It has more effective healing and protection spells, and uses bows and crossbows in combination with offensive spell- casting. * In the video game The Lord of the Rings: Conquest players have a chance to play as a mage. The mage wields a staff and shoots lightning, fires a shockwave, fires a ball of fire and perform melee attacks. There are three mage heroes in the game, who are Gandalf, Saruman, and the Mouth of Sauron. * In the video game Gauntlet, the wizard is one of four characters that a player can choose to guide through mazes, the other three being the elf, the valkyrie and the warrior. * Mage is one of the three playable classes in the Dragon Age series (the other two being Warrior and Rogue). Mages are powerful combatants who can employ a variety of different spells, ranging from manipulation of the natural elements to mental control and physical healing. In this universe, mages have a unique position in society - every child born with magical talents must be sent to the Circle of Magi, where they will spend their lives isolated from the outside world, dedicating all their time to lessons from experienced sorcerers. This is due to the fact that Mages attract demons and spirits which can possess them and turn them into threats. The role of the Circle of Magi and whether its existence constitutes reasonable concern for the safety of society, or unfair oppression of mages, is central to the plot of Dragon Age II. * In Realm of the Mad God, the wizard is the first class the player is available to choose. They use magic staves as their weapon to fire magic bolts and have a spell as their special attack. They use robes as armor which also may give them extra mana points. When reaching a level with the wizard, you can unlock more classes. * In Miitopia, the wizard serves as the Mage Class, a class that uses magic for attacks. However, the Mage needs to level up in order to use magic. When magic attacks are used, Mages use some MP. MP can be restored through MP Candies, staying in the safe spot or getting sprinkled by the player's MP Sprinkles. The max MP can be upgraded with eating grub, and leveling up. In Miitopia, the preferred weapon of the mage is a wand, while the preferred clothes of the mage are robes See also * Magician (fantasy) *Wizard (disambiguation) References Category:Character classes Category:Video games about magic ","title":"Wizard (character class)"},{"id":"3951660","text":"The dilator naris muscle is a part of the nasalis muscle.

(2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . It is often found to involve the gums, the skin and nasal septum, and has also been found far from the head such as in the thigh. Pyogenic granulomas may be seen at any age, and are more common in females than males. In pregnant women, lesions may occur in the first trimester with an increasing incidence up until the seventh month, and are often seen on the gums. Signs and symptoms The appearance of pyogenic granuloma is usually a color ranging from red/pink to purple, grow rapidly, and can be smooth or mushroom-shaped. Younger lesions are more likely to be red because of the high number of blood vessels. Older lesions begin to change into a pink color. Size commonly ranges from a few millimeters to centimeters, though smaller or larger lesions may occur. A pyogenic granuloma can be painful, especially if located in an area of the body where it is constantly disturbed. Pyogenic granulomas can grow rapidly and will often bleed profusely with little or no trauma. They may exude an oil like substance, causing the surface to be damp. This is especially true if the granuloma is located on the scalp. Epulis granulomatosum is a variant of pyogenic granuloma that forms only on gingiva, and is often seen forming in a recent extraction socket. Pyogenic granulomas appear on the gingiva in 75% of cases, more often in the maxillary than mandibular jaw. Anterior areas are more often affected than posterior areas. It can also be found on the lips, tongue, and inner cheek. Poor oral hygiene or trauma are usually precipitating factors. One study has suggested a correlation between pyogenic granulomas and Bartonella seropositivity. However, this association has been questioned by others. The microscopic appearance of a pyogenic granuloma consists of highly vascular granulation tissue. Inflammation is present. The lesion may have a fibrous character if it is older, and the surface may have ulcerations. Pyogenic granulomas rarely occur in the conjunctiva, cornea or connective tissue of the eye following minor local trauma. Grossly these mass lesions resemble those occurring at more common sites. The relationship of these lesions to lobular capillary hemangiomas of skin and oropharyngeal mucosa commonly referred to as pyogenic granuloma is uncertain. File:Pyogenic granuloma on a finger-1.jpg File:Pyogenic Granuloma Thumb 1.JPG File:Pyogenic Granuloma Thumb 2.JPG =Associated conditions= Due to its overwhelming incidence on the gingiva, the condition is often associated with two other diseases, though not because they occur together. Instead, the three are associated with each other because they appear frequently on gingiva‚Äîperipheral giant cell granuloma and peripheral ossifying fibroma. Detailed analysis can be used to distinguish these conditions. Cause Pyogenic granulomas are caused by proliferation of capillaries and are not caused by infection or cancer. Diagnosis A doctor will likely be able to diagnose a pyogenic granuloma based on its appearance, and might perform a biopsy to make a more accurate diagnosis. A biopsy also helps rule out malignant (cancerous) medical conditions that can cause a similar kind of growth. These conditions include squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Histopathological examination shows multiple capillaries (due to the vascular nature of the tumour), neutrophils (pyogenic) and necrotic tissue. Management Although pyogenic granulomas are not infectious or cancer, treatment may be considered because of bleeding or ulceration. Frequently, pyogenic granulomas are treated with electrodesiccation (cauterization) and curettage (excision), though laser treatment using pulsed dye laser or CO2 laser is often effective. Several reports have demonstrated the efficacy of topical application of the beta- adrenergic antagonist timolol in the treatment of pediatric pyogenic granuloma. There is usually no treatment if the pyogenic granuloma occurs during pregnancy since the lesion may heal spontaneously. Recurrent bleeding in either oral or nasal lesions may necessitate excision and cauterization sooner, however. If aesthetics are a concern, then treatment may be pursued as well. Usually, only minor surgery may be needed, along with a dental cleaning for oral lesions to remove any calculus or other source of irritation. For nasal lesions, nose-picking should be discouraged. Prognosis Prognosis is usually good, however recurrence may happen with rate up to 16%. Presence of myxoid structures in the pyogenic granuloma may be the main cause of recurrence. History  Pyogenic granulomas were first described in 1897 by two French surgeons, Antonin Poncet and Dor, who named these lesions botryomycosis hominis. Terminology The name pyogenic granuloma is misleading as it is neither pyogenic or a true granuloma. In actuality, it is a capillary hemangioma of lobular subtype, which is why such a lesion is prone to bleeding. It is also not truly pyogenic (pus-producing), as the cause is hormonal or traumatic and has no association with infection or pus production.

History The 1st Darwin Scout Group in Darwin was registered in 1928 under the command of Captain Len Samut. At that time it was registered with The Boy Scouts Association New South Wales Branch, but its registration passed to the association's Queensland Branch in 1929. The first group registered in Alice Springs was in 1936, but there are suggestions that Scouting had been operating there since 1923. The first Group to be formed in Tennant Creek was in 1941, and the first group to be formed in Katherine was in 1957, giving Scouting a presence in the main Territory towns. Registration passed from The Boy Scouts Association's Queensland Branch to its South Australian Branch in 1955. At that time, Scouting had not fully recovered from the Second World War and only two troops, 2nd Darwin and 1st Alice Springs, were recorded as operating. Details with a photograph in the Chinese- Australian Historical Images in Australia (CHIA) database states that the 1st Scout Troop finished in 1931 and that the 2nd Darwin Scout Troop was established by Jo Ruddict in 1938.

He wrote it on 2 December 1854, and it was published on 9 December 1854 in The Examiner. He was the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom at the time. Past events=Composition= During 1854, when Great Britain was engaged in the Crimean War, Tennyson wrote several patriotic poems under various pseudonyms. Scholars speculate that Tennyson created his pen names because these verses used a traditional structure Tennyson employed in his earlier career but suppressed during the 1840s,Francis 113 worrying that poems like \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\" (which he initially signed only A.T.) \\"might prove not to be decorous for a poet laureate\\".Shannon and Ricks 3 The poem was written after the Light Cavalry Brigade suffered great casualties in the Battle of Balaclava. Tennyson wrote the poem based on two articles published in The Times: the first, published on 13 November 1854, contained the sentence \\"The British soldier will do his duty, even to certain death, and is not paralyzed by the feeling that he is the victim of some hideous blunder,\\" the last three words of which provided the inspiration for his phrase \\"Some one had blunder'd.\\"Shannon and Ricks 1 The poem was written in a few minutes on December 2 of the same year, based on a recollection of The Times's account;Shannon and Ricks 2 Tennyson wrote other similar poems, like \\"Riflemen Form!\\", in a very similar manner.Francis 115 =Later versions= Tennyson made revisions to the poem due to criticisms by the American poet Frederick Goddard Tuckerman and others;Shannon and Ricks 7 these were published in Tennyson's volume Maud and Other Poems (1855). These changes were criticized by several, including both Tennyson and Tuckerman. At the suggestion of Jane, Lady Franklin, Tennyson sent a thousand copies of a single-sheet version of the poem to be distributed among soldiers in the Crimea.Alfred Lord Tennyson, Poems, ed. Hallam Lord Tennyson and annotated by Alfred Lord Tennyson (London: Macmillan, 1908), II, 369; Shannon and Ricks 8. For this he rethought the revisions in Maud and Other Poems, and this rethought version was used for the second edition of Maud, in 1856.Shannon and Ricks 10‚Äì11 Tennyson recited this poem onto a wax cylinder in 1890. =Kipling's postscript= Rudyard Kipling wrote \\"The Last of the Light Brigade\\" (1891) some 40 years after the appearance of \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\". His poem focuses on the terrible hardships faced in old age by veterans of the Crimean War, as exemplified by the cavalry men of the Light Brigade. Its purpose was to shame the British public into offering financial assistance.

This sea urchin is characterized by its exceptionally long black spines. It is the most abundant and important herbivore on the coral reefs of the western Atlantic and Caribbean basin. When the population of these sea urchins is at a healthy level, they are the main grazers which prevent algae overgrowth of the reef. Anatomy Diadema antillarum has a test,, or \\"shell,\\" similar to most other sea urchins. What distinguishes the Diadema is the length of its spines. Most sea urchin spines are 1‚Äì3 cm, but the spines in this species are usually 10‚Äì12 cm in length, and can grow as long as 30 cm in very large individuals. Life habits This species usually lives at 1‚Äì10 metres in depth on coral reefs. They will often lodge themselves in a crevice, so that only their spines can be seen, but individual urchins who can't find a suitable crevice will live in more exposed situations. Individuals that have been able to find a crevice usually will roam about one metre from their crevice at night during feeding. Diadema is very sensitive to light, and will often pick its crevice or resting place based on how much shade there is. Diadema mostly eat algae, and sometimes seagrass. Starving urchins have been known to become carnivorous. Ecological Importance Diadema antillarum is still, in some tropical areas, one of the most abundant, widespread, and ecologically-important shallow-water sea urchins. It is found in the tropical Western Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and the northern and eastern coasts of South America (as far south as Brazil). It is also found in the East Atlantic at the Canary Islands and the Indian Ocean. This species is ecologically important because it consumes algae that can otherwise grow to such an extent that they can smother coral reefs. They live in holes that are in the reef. Die-off of urchins In 1983, throughout the Caribbean faunal zone as far south as South America and north to the Bahamas, Diadema antillarum underwent mass mortality, with more than 97% of the urchins dying. Since this time some Caribbean reefs have been overgrown by foliose macroalgae. This inhibits coral growth and has further compounded the ongoing decline of scleractinian corals. It also has an overall negative effect on coral reef resilience, which encompasses the ability of a system to resist and recover from changes stemming from perturbation events. Recent studies done in Discovery Bay, Jamaica, and other locations appear to show a massive comeback of Diadema, and great regeneration of the reefs. Human relevance When the sea urchins died due to an unknown disease, the biodiversity of the marine life of the coral reefs suffered a great deal. The resulting lush algae growth stunted and even reversed the development of coral, and the fish and other animals living on the reefs declined in numbers due to less food and shelter. The reduced biodiversity of the coral reefs affected tourism in several small countries, which depended on the natural beauty of their reefs to help attract visitors, and because tourism was a major part of the income for these countries, the decreased flow of guests stressed their economy. Low-density populations, predators, and waves from high-powered storms tends to impede the repopulation of Diadema antillarum. In the fertilization process, male and female urchins excrete fluid to alert other urchins to respond by releasing their eggs and sperm in mass reproduction. With more gametes available, there is a higher chance of fertilization. However, in areas of low-population, a few sea urchins may not be enough to initiate fertilization. After fertilization, there is still a high chance that predators may consume the vulnerable juveniles. Because of the movement of water in powerful storms, urchins can get swept away from their habitat and expire. It is possible to aid the increase in population growth of the urchin with more research and volunteers. Research on re- population of the species thumb Research on the species Diadema antillarum is still in its early stages. The urchins can be grown in laboratories and then relocated. Returning the mature individuals into the wild can have a positive effect on the urchin density of the reef. The increase in population can also be aided by the artificial building of reefs: material such as concrete can encourage the growth of coral, and provide more niches for the urchins to hide from predators such as larger fish. When there are still some areas of high-density urchins, it is possible to relocate urchins to other, low-density reefs. With these methods and the help of volunteer workers, it seems that the shift back to coral-dominated reefs and away from algae- dominated reefs is possible. When re-locating Diadema it is necessary to remove most mature algae from the re-location area since there are toxins in mature algae that kills the Diadema.

The truce was reached just days before the 1992 Los Angeles riots and, although not universally adhered to, was a major factor in the decline of street violence in the city between the 1990s and 2010s. Background and 1988 attempt The late 1960s and the 1970s saw the formation of the Crips and the Bloods, which became rival gangs, but by the 1980s the infiltration of rock cocaine and high-powered weapons into poor inner cities had created infighting among factions. By the early 1990s, after 20 years of increasing gang warfare across public housing projects that saw peak crime rates in Los Angeles, gang members themselves began trying to stem the violence. An effort took place in 1988, which was dubbed the \\"Year of the Gang\\" by the LAPD and city leaders following the death of Karen Toshima in the city's Westwood neighborhood. In July of that year, the Rev. Charles Mims Jr. and others organized a gang summit in South Los Angeles, but formal support for gang prevention was non-existent at the time and this early effort was short-lived. In October of 1989, Minister Louis Farrakhan visited Los Angeles to deliver his Stop the Killing speech aimed at curtailing gang killings. He returned for part two at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena in January of 1990 where hundreds of Crips and Bloods members were in attendance. 1992 truce In April of 1992, Crips and Bloods in the Watts neighborhood in southern Los Angeles convened to negotiate peace. The Grape Street Crips from the Jordan Downs Projects, the P Jay Watts Crips from the Imperial Courts housing projects, the Bounty Hunter Bloods from the Nickerson Gardens housing projects, and the Hacienda Village Bloods agreed to a ceasefire agreement following the death of Henry Pico, who had been shot execution-style by LAPD officers during a blackout in the Imperial Courts housing project. On April 28, 1992, representatives from these four gangs signed a formal peace treaty at a masjid in Watts. The treaty was modeled on the 1949 Armistice Agreements reached between Israel and Egypt. Within days of the truce, despite the relative lawlessness caused by the 1992 Los Angeles riots, most of the African-American gangs in the city declared themselves at peace and there were no major flare-ups in violence. The Watts truce is generally credited with contributing to the trend in declining street violence rates in Los Angeles. In popular culture * The rapper Ice-T, who grew up in nearby Crenshaw, wrote the song \\"Gotta Lotta Love\\" on his album Home Invasion in tribute to the truce. * In the song \\"Real Muthaphuckkin G's\\" by Eazy-E, guest rapper Dresta raps about how Dr. Dre only started trying to act like a gangsta \\"around the time of the peace treaty\\", when he knew the streets of Los Angeles had calmed down. * In the film Straight Outta Compton, two men approach the police with a red handkerchief tied to a blue handkerchief, symbolizing the gang truce during the 1992 riots.

It was the first film to be written and directed by British-born Canadian actor David Hewlett, who is best known for his role of Dr. Rodney McKay in the TV franchise Stargate. Hewlett created the film as a private off-season project and stars alongside his real-life sister Kate Hewlett and Stargate actors Paul McGillion, Christopher Judge and Rachel Luttrell. The film was produced by John Lenic and Jane Loughman. Due to its strong affiliation with the Stargate franchise, the film generated considerable buzz within the Stargate fandom. It had several screenings in selected major towns in the US and the UK in late 2006 and 2007. MGM picked up worldwide television and home video rights to the film in early December 2006. The film was released on DVD on September 18, 2007 in The United States and Canada. Plot Patrick (David Hewlett) is single, loves his dog (Mars the Dog) and still lives in his parents' house ten years after their death. Shortly before Christmas, Patrick's sister Marilyn (Kate Hewlett) visits Patrick to introduce him to Ryan (Paul McGillion), a science fiction television star. After accidentally knocking Ryan out with a cricket bat, Patrick is shocked to learn of Marilyn's engagement to Ryan. Patrick also overhears a dialogue excerpt that Ryan cites over the phone, which makes Patrick believe that Ryan wants to kill Marilyn. From this time on, Patrick tries everything in his power to protect his sister. But an apparently fatal accident happens: While Patrick is on the phone with Marilyn, Ryan tries to mount Christmas lights and falls off the ladder. Patrick panics and tries everything to hide Ryan's death from his sister, disposing of the body in the garden and in a nearby lake. But Ryan's dead body reappears each time. In an effort to interest Marilyn in other men, Patrick posts a fake online dating profile and arranges a blind date between Marilyn and a man named Chris (Christopher Judge). When Marilyn alerts the police that Ryan is missing, Ryan's aunt investigates Ryan's disappearance. After first suspecting Marilyn, Patrick's cover blows. Because it looks bad for Marilyn, the siblings decide to dismember Ryan's body and give it to Mars and the neighbors' dogs as food. Finally, when Patrick admits that Ryan has basically always been a friend to him, Marilyn reveals her plan: She and Ryan just faked his death, and the body that Patrick has been trying to get rid of has been Marilyn's sex doll all the time. Ryan has assumed the role of his aunt. Some time later, when Patrick grows comfortable with the idea to accept Ryan as his brother-in- law, Ryan's sister Elise (Amanda Byram) arrives but is not enthused with the upcoming wedding. A love at first sight between Patrick and Elise is apparent. While Marilyn shows her sister-in-law to-be the house, Ryan leads Patrick to the lake, with a moose figure behind his back. CastProduction=Conception= Inspired by other actors pursuing a career in directing, David Hewlett wanted to spend his hiatus from Stargate Atlantis with other projects. He wrote three scripts of the horror and thriller genre before he got the idea for A Dog's Breakfast. He chose a more humorous subject because Stargate Atlantis generally involves peril despite its comedy elements. Hewlett considered the movie as a personal challenge and did not have wide- distribution plans initially. The title of the film is derived from an English slang phrase meaning \\"a mess or muddle\\". In an online radio interview, David Hewlett joked that he chose this title so that the movie would have the right title if it didn't work out. He also said that the main character makes a mess out of everything, including murder, so the title was in fact carefully chosen. Although David Hewlett had been rather focused on the actors and the acting before, he started paying more attention to old style comedy film- making such as works of Monty Python and director Blake Edwards. In general, old-fashioned comedies appealed more to him than comedy films of recent history. Hewlett said he copied some old-fashioned techniques into his own project. He specifically mentioned A Fish Called Wanda and Fawlty Towers as major influences. Despite A Dog's Breakfast's murder theme, Hewlett wanted to avoid violence and gore as audience attraction, and rather produce a family film for all ages. He thinks that younger members of the audience will enjoy the cartoon-like elements of the movie. Hewlett further mentioned Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd of the silent era of movie-making as major influences, who he says reflect a simpler method of story-telling and comedy. Similarly, he did not want to overdo cutting and manipulation, as he feared this would endanger the comedy effect. =Filming= With the idea of making a movie, David Hewlett and Jane Loughman approached Stargate producer John Lenic, who arranged deals with motion picture companies. Paramount Production Services in Vancouver were confident enough in them to support them with free grip and electric equipment. Panavision Canada provided HD cameras for two weeks for a day's rate. The majority of A Dog's Breakfast was filmed on a fourteen-day schedule and with extremely limited funds in January 2006 when Stargate Atlantis (the TV show David Hewlett stars in) was on hiatus between seasons, although some scenes had already been filmed on Saturdays during the Atlantis season. David Hewlett had originally planned to shoot at his own house in Washington, but legal problems due to its U.S. location forced the otherwise Canadian production to rent a house near Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. Vancouver proved convenient as an alternative. Many of the local actors and crew were eager to participate in the project, since the Vancouver winter weather creates a yearly lull in the local acting business. As such, A Dog's Breakfast featured many actors, crew members and pieces of equipment that are usually associated with the Stargate franchise. David Hewlett plays Rodney McKay in Stargate Atlantis, Kate Hewlett plays McKay's sister in several Atlantis episodes, Paul McGillion and Rachel Luttrell play Carson Beckett and Teyla Emmagan in Atlantis, respectively, and Christopher Judge is known as Teal'c from Stargate SG-1. Hewlett joked that McGillion joined the project because \\"he [had] nothing else to do,\\" and that his sister, Kate Hewlett, \\"was really hard to get a hold of, because she's got a writing/acting career herself.\\" Hewlett considered Christopher Judge for the role of the \\"Internet- dating loser\\" because \\"he seemed so incredibly inappropriate for the part that I thought it would be very funny to have him play it.\\" Luttrell played \\"a space princess on the cheesy show.\\" A Dog's Breakfast producer John Lenic is a producer on Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis, and several other film crew members have significantly contributed to Stargate previously: Jim Menard (cinematography), James Robbins (production design), Mark & Robert Davidson (set decoration), Jan Newman (key makeup artist), Bill Mizel (first assistant director), Wray Douglas (special effects supervisor), James Bamford (stunt coordinator), Will Waring (camera operator), and Ivon Bartok (Behind the Scenes director). One set that is featured in the film as well as on Stargate is the Starcrossed spacecraft set, which stands in for several spaceships in the Stargate series, such as the Daedalus-class battlecruisers and the Prometheus. Music was composed by Timothy Williams. Hewlett wrote the script especially around those availabilities. This made it possible to produce the film with a budget of $120,000 total to film and produce, mostly privately raised. =Marketing= Promotional poster. The script was written with the Stargate audience in mind and pet lovers as a secondary audience. David Hewlett stated that he consciously wrote for certain audiences, as he had seen too many independent film makers fail who did not do so. Before contacting possible distributors, the producers of A Dog's Breakfast mapped out specific marketing strategies by visiting Stargate websites to learn about DVD sales, television viewers and convention attendance around the world. Inspired by The Long Tail, Hewlett started an internet marketing campaign by setting up a YouTube channel and his own producer blog for $8 a month to keep promotion costs down. Hewlett discussed marketing strategies with eager fans online. He called this Squirrel Marketing. Promoting the movie from a Stargate angle plus high YouTube sneak preview viewing numbers and a full theater for the test screening helped to convince Stargate's distributor MGM to make a deal with A Dog's Breakfast in November 2006. MGM in turn took advantage of Hewlett's grassroots support and wanted to make the movie into a test-run for direct-to- download releases. MGM officially announced the pick-up for worldwide television and home video rights on December 4, 2006. Releases David Hewlett and his production team did not consider a theatrical release for A Dog's Breakfast until they noticed its potential to generate interest and to enable fans to see the film. They arranged a first sneak preview at the Creation Stargate Convention in Los Angeles on November 16, 2006. Two further screenings took place in London on February 1, 2007, with the second one only being arranged after the first planned screening had unexpectedly sold out online within twenty minutes. A Dog's Breakfast was screened several times at the Cinequest San Jose Film Festival in early March 2007, and two screenings took place in the city of Vancouver on March 25, 2007. In the screening at the 2007 Stratford-Upon-Avon Film Festival on May 24 and 26, the film was awarded Best Feature Film, and David Hewlett won the award for Best Actor. The Glastonbury Festival screened A Dog's Breakfast on June 22, 2007.Glastonbury Festivals Although highly unusual for new movies, A Dog's Breakfast was offered in other digital formats months before the official DVD release, with iTunes and Amazon Unbox beginning their release on July 4, 2007. MGM senior executive vice president Charles Cohen considered this as a natural move due to the high amount of interest among the Stargate fan online community. A release on hulu.com followed later. The film was released on RC1 DVD (North America) on September 18, 2007. MGM originally planned an international release for between April and June 2008, which they later pushed back to August 2008 to be published in tandem with Stargate: Continuum. However, as of May 2009, MGM held off an international release for up to December 2009. A UK release date remains unknown. The DVD contains special features, including a commentary track, deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes, and interviews with the cast and crew. Reception GateWorld gave four out of four stars for the \\"mix of physical comedy and goofy sound effects, smart storytelling and a good deal of warmth\\". The reviewer labeled the movie a must-see for David Hewlett fans, and considered the acting \\"very real\\", with \\"delightful bonuses to Stargate fans\\". BostonNOW thought the movie was \\"well worth watching\\" and \\"quirky, funny and, that rarest of finds in comedy, original.\\" They liked the comic timing of the actors, especially Hewlett. DVDSnapshot further found the low-budget indie project \\"a surprisingly good [film] while not relying on any big name stars or special effects.\\" The Hewlett siblings were considered to have a \\"great onscreen brother-sister chemistry\\", and Paul McGillion's performance was lauded despite the few scenes he appears in. DVDSnapshot also stated that \\"the obvious jabs at Stargate are a lot of fun.\\" DVD Talk \\"highly recommended\\" the film as \\"unquestionably one of the best direct-to-video releases of the year,\\" comparing the film to \\"Arsenic and Old Lace gone maniacally modern. [...] Breakfast reveals how great comedy is not dependent on cost ‚Äì put together an intelligent script and a talented cast, and look how solid the results can be.\\" The character work and beats, the direction and Hewlett's performance as \\"a master of wild overreaction and cartoonish screams\\" receive further positive mention. The Leader-Post found \\"what it may lack in polish it more than makes up for in wit and fun. The result is a quirky black comedy with plenty of Monty Python-esque humour and a hint of \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\". [...] The movie's originality and simplicity is an asset as the spotlight is reserved fully for David Hewlett and his great acting abilities.\\" Starcrossed and sequels Starcrossed is a science fiction show originally within A Dog's Breakfast, created as a tribute to Stargate. During the movie production, several people told David Hewlett that Starcrossed should be made into a real show, so Hewlett approached NBC Universal and the Sci Fi Channel.A Dog's Breakfast Q&A; session at the Cinequest San Jose Film Festival with David Hewlett and Jane Loughman, on March 3, 2007. David Hewlett wrote a draft for the Starcrossed pilot in late January 2007 and sent it to the network, who bought the pilot in return. A press release by the Sci Fi Channel described Starcrossed as a high touch, high-tech half-hour comedy about life behind the camera at a long-running sci- fi space soap, similar to the movie Galaxy Quest. David Hewlett further outlined Starcrossed as a \\"situation comedy about the making of a science fiction show, because there's really nothing sillier than serious science fiction. [...] It's very loosely based on a Stargate kind of thing, but it's not Stargate. It's not a spoof. It's just the silliness of the day-to-day life of trying to make a television series\\". In March 2007, David Hewlett acknowledged that although Starcrossed made it into script stage, it might never be filmed. In July 2007, however, he stated that a Starcrossed deal was still much possible, leading to another potential hiatus project for him. Hewlett also mentioned the project in September 2007, stating that he was still in talks with Sci Fi \\"about spinning off [Starcrossed] into a Larry Sanders-type show about making science fiction.\\" Other possibilities are producing webisodes. In March 2008, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Starcrossed was planned to debut in the fourth quarter of 2008 as an original web series, produced by Universal Media Studios, Jane Loughman and John Lenic. However, none of the plans were implemented. In April 2009, David Hewlett said via his Twitter account that Sci Fi would return the rights of Starcrossed to him and that he planned to shoot a two-hour pilot episode himself. In his blogs and in an interview in 2008, David Hewlett hinted at a possible sequel, Heir of the Dog. He said that he would like to bring back Christopher Judge, Rachel Luttrell, and Paul McGillion in the sequel.

This includes the right to impose military service obligations, or to require an exit permit to leave. The United Kingdom may still make informal diplomatic representations to the authorities of another country when a British citizen is held in another country, even if that person is also a citizen of that country, in case of special humanitarian needs, such as the intervention made by then UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond during the Causeway Bay Books Disappearances. During the Cold War era, the United States signed consular agreements with certain Warsaw Pact countries providing that a U.S. citizen who entered that country with a U.S. passport and the appropriate visa would not be subsequently treated as a citizen of that country (and hence prevented from leaving).For example see U.S.-Poland Bilateral Consular Convention . The Warsaw Pact countries involved (notably Poland) wished to encourage tourism from emigrants and their descendants settled in the U.S. Since the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991, many of those countries have abolished visa requirements for U.S. citizens thus nullifying those provisions (for detailed discussion see under Dual citizenship of Poland).

Mackenzie worked as a newscaster between 1981 and 1997. She started her career with Grampian TV, in Aberdeen, before joining BBC Scotland in 1995. She became a political and current affairs presenter in 1998, anchoring several BBC network programmes. Mackenzie was also part of the Newsnight Scotland team, with BBC Scotland, from its launch in October 1999 to July 2007. She could also be heard fronting factual programmes for BBC Radio 4 in London. Early years Mackenzie was born in Stornoway and grew up on the peninsula of Point, Outer Hebrides. Her mother Katie Ann (n√©e Maclean; 1924-1979), was a midwife, and her father Donald (1924-1996) was a postmaster at his parents' post office in Portnaguran. Donald Mackenzie also fought in the Second World War. She has one brother, Lewis, who has a PhD in physics and is a senior lecturer in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow. Mackenzie's paternal grandparents were Donald (1880-1967) and Annie Mackenzie (n√©e Macdonald; 1900-1987). They were married in June 1921 in Aberdeen. They ran the Portnaguran Post Office beside their house in Aird Point for most of their lives, where it is assumed they met. Donald Mackenzie was a direct male-line descendant of The Hon. Alexander Mackenzie (1680-1757), the second son of Kenneth Mackenzie, 4th Earl of Seaforth and his wife Lady Frances Herbert, the eldest child of William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis and his wife Elizabeth, the second daughter of Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester. A student of the Nicolson Institute in Stornoway, Mackenzie left for the mainland to study history at the University of Glasgow. She graduated with an MA Honours and had intended to become a teacher. She returned to the Isle of Lewis, where she met a producer for Grampian TV, (now STV North), who was on holiday. He offered her a screen test, and she embarked on a career as a journalist and broadcaster that spanned more than twenty five years.  Career = The Grampian years = In 1981, she became a trainee journalist at the age of twenty. She reported and co-hosted the regional TV station's news programme North Tonight for fourteen years. Throughout the eighties, North Tonight was replaced by Summer at Six during the summer months, which was a more informal lifestyle magazine with a brief news summary. Mackenzie was involved in the news output during this period. Mackenzie hosted the political show Crossfire from the mid-eighties. She also presented several regional affairs shows, such as We The Jury and One Life To Live. She was involved in Grampian's coverage of the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster. Anne Mackenzie also fronted many North Tonight specials for the station. In 1989 she interviewed the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, from Grampian's Dundee studios. During her time at Grampian Television, Mackenzie was nicknamed 'the duchess' for being the top female at the television station. = Switching channels = Anne Mackenzie was recruited by the BBC in 1995. She presented her first edition of Scotland's national news programme, Reporting Scotland, on Wednesday 6 December 1995. She went on to host every Wednesday early evening broadcast. She also presented Good Morning Scotland on BBC Radio Scotland three mornings a week. Mackenzie's bosses offered her another night fronting the nightly broadcast. She was now at the helm every Tuesday and Wednesday night. Mackenzie continued her work with Radio Scotland and also fronted political shows, including Cross Examination. Anne Mackenzie was involved in BBC Scotland's coverage of the 1996 Dunblane Massacre. Later that year she reported for the BBC network current affairs show Here and Now, with Sue Lawley. Mackenzie also anchored several BBC Scotland current affairs programmes, fronting an economic debate programme called, Grasping the Thistle. In October 1997, Mackenzie left Radio Scotland as part of schedule changes to Reporting Scotland. She would now host the programme with Jackie Bird on alternate nights, as part of a mini revamp of the broadcast. This was short lived, as she left the show two months later, in December 1997, to front London-based Westminster Live. Mackenzie hosted Westminster Live from 20 January 1998. She was also a regular stand in for David Frost on the Breakfast with Frost programme in 1998 (and again in 2000). She also presented the BBC's late night political programme Despatch Box = A new era = In August 1999 it was announced that she had been chosen to present Newsnight Scotland with Gordon Brewer. On 6 October 1999, she was part of the launch team for Newsnight Scotland, BBC Scotland's late night news and current affairs programme, which was a response to the creation of the newly devolved Scottish government. She was a regular presenter on the programme, usually presenting the show every Thursday night. Mackenzie was involved in the station's political coverage during Westminster and Holyrood elections. She has reported for BBC Scotland in the 1997 and 2001 general elections and the 1999 and 2003 Scottish parliamentary elections. During the 2003 campaign, Anne Mackenzie interviewed all the Scottish party leaders and chaired The Big Debate for BBC Scotland. On 5 May 2005, Mackenzie presented the UK election coverage for BBC Scotland from a 'Scottish perspective'. This was the first time BBC Scotland's Election Night programme was broadcast on BBC One Scotland. Anne Mackenzie was also a presenter on BBC Radio 4 in London, where she presented The World Tonight, before moving to the Four Corners factual series. On 29 March 2007, the BBC announced that Anne Mackenzie would front BBC One network coverage of Election Night 2007 and would continue to host The Big Debate series for BBC Scotland throughout the election campaign. Mackenzie also teamed up with David Dimbleby for the main BBC broadcast on 3 May 2007. = Formidable interviewer = Some commenters saw Mackenzie as a fierce interviewer. Gavin Docherty of the Sunday Mail wrote in 1999: \\"She is best known for her confrontational interview style - and the politicians know there is always the chance she'll jump down their throat and dance all over their tonsils\\". = Award winner = Anne Mackenzie was recognised in 1995 with a BAFTA award. This was for her work for the North Tonight nightly broadcast. In 1999, she hosted the first ever Scottish Politician Of The Year Awards on STV. She was voted among the Top 50 Most Powerful Scottish Women in a poll for the Scotsman newspaper.  Personal life  Mackenzie married Neil McConaghy in 1992 at an Aberdeen church. They have a son named Jack Donald Stewart, who was born in September 1998. She lists reading and music as her main hobbies.

He has played professionally since the late 1960s. In addition to his two solo albums, he has written songs for many other artists including Kathy Troccoli, Sandi Patty, and the Gaither Vocal Band. His musical versatility has enabled him to traverse several musical genres including gospel, country, and rock. Gary is originally from St. Joseph, Missouri. Although he is a talented guitarist and a practitioner of several different instruments, he is most known as a piano and keyboard virtuoso. A formally trained musician, Gary began his musical endeavors early, writing music and performing live as a young teen. Gary moved to California in 1973 and toured with the final incarnation of the L.A. rock band Blues Image (of \\"Ride, Captain, Ride\\" fame). After several years, the rigors of life on the road and the constant stress of touring resulted in problems in his personal life. However, it was this very life crises that brought Gary to a spiritual awakening and with it the realization of his great need for a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. This awakening was so powerful that it not only came to encompass his private life but his musical career as well. He dedicated himself completely to God's call and became a \\"music evangelist.\\" For a couple of years, he performed as an indie artist. Gary moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1979 to begin in earnest his Christian music ministry. He soon signed with NewPax Records and eventually recorded two top albums: \\"Gary Dunham\\" in 1980 and \\"The Pearl\\" in 1982. From these albums came his two most popular songs, the CCM hit singles, \\"Happy Family\\" and \\"The Pearl,\\" both of whom he co-wrote with Rosemary Dunham-Yocam. From 1978 until 1982, Gary traveled and primarily performed as a solo artist, even playing on the college and small club circuits. In 1983, renowned Christian artist Don Francisco invited Gary to join him on tour. For several years, the duo performed and recorded together with great success. However, during the 1990s, Gary greatly cut back on his touring. Gary now resides again in his hometown of St. Joseph (MO) and continues to write and perform music.

Plot Soyo (Chun Jung-myung) is a quiet, conscientious sixth form student. Although he doesn't enjoy school, he attends dutifully, without a word of complaint. And then, one day, he discovers inline skating. A complete beginner, he practices at first in a hidden corner of the park. Here, he meets a group of wild skaters and immediately, one skater, Mogi (Kim Kang-woo), catches his eye. His adventurous jumps and breathtaking loops defy all laws of gravity. Mogi is without doubt the star of the group. His stunts, his style and the cool way he executes even the most daring of figures are unrivalled. Mogi's girlfriend, Hanjoo (Jo Yi-jin), invites Soyo to join their team and he accepts enthusiastically. No sooner does he become a member of the skaters than his life changes completely. The loneliness Soyo sometimes felt simply disappears ‚Äì as does his quiet existence. He soon makes enormous progress as a skater.

Deutsch was one of the founding fathers of the field of conflict resolution. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Deutsch as the 63rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Early life and education Morton Deutsch was born in 1920 in the Bronx, New York City into a family with three other children.Sam Roberts, \\"Morton Deutsch, Conflict Resolution Expert, Dies at 97\\", New York Times, March 23, 2017 By age 15 he was enrolled in university at the City College of New York. Deutsch started on a path into psychiatry, but switched to psychology after dissecting a guinea pig in a biology class. He received a B.S. from the City College of New York in 1939 and his M.A. in 1940 from the University of Pennsylvania.COMMENCEMENT; President of Columbia Recalls Rushdie's Plight by Lee A. Daniels, New York Times May 14, 1992 After his M.A. degree, Deutsch held a rotating internship that cycled between three New York State institutions: Letchworth Village (for the mentally incompetent), Warwick (for delinquent boys), and Rockland State Hospital (for mentally disturbed children and adults). Deutsch joined the US Air Force after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, where he initially acted as a psychologist, then as a navigator flying in thirty bombing missions over Nazi Germany. During active combat Deutsch was honored with a Distinguished Flying Cross (and cluster) and an Air Medal (with three clusters). After his tour of duty was completed he served as a clinical psychologist in an Air Force convalescent hospital until his discharge. Subsequently, he studied at MIT under Kurt Lewin, where he was graduated with a Ph.D. in 1948. He wrote his dissertation comparing the psychological effects and productivity of cooperative groups and competitive groups. Deutsch worked as a part of Lewin's Research Center for Group Dynamics, and his early research was largely tinged by the growing global concern with nuclear weapons. He was also tasked with instructing introductory psychology classes to undergraduate students, in which he undertook an experiment comparing cooperative and competitive grading processes. This led to the major theoretical contribution Deutsch made during his early career; the \\"Theory of Cooperation and Competition\\", which studies interdependence among goals (cooperative versus competitive) and types of actions taken (effective versus bungling). The study uses three concepts to develop their implications for the social processes and personal relations that occur in groups: substitutability (how a person's actions are able to satisfy the intentions of another), cathexis (an individual's disposition to evaluate themselves or their surroundings), and inducibility (the readiness of an individual to accept the influence of another person). The theory was first presented in a paper published in 1949. While at MIT Deutsch also met his future wife Lydia Shapiro when he was assigned to supervise her work under Lewin. They married on June 1, 1947, a year and a half after they met, and have remained together ever since. Early career One of the first projects of Deutsch's academic career was a study of group tension and racial attitudes as a part of the Commission on Community Interrelations of the American Jewish Congress. The goal of the Commission's work was to break through the apathy that the American society of the time had against religious or racial prejudice. In 1951, Deutsch and coauthor Mary Evans Collins, working out of the Research Center for Human Relations at NYU (where Deutsch had started working in 1949), produced a study comparing racially integrated housing in New York with racially segregated housing in Newark, New Jersey. Up until their study it was the norm for housing projects to follow a policy of segregation. The results of their study led to a reversal of policy in publicly held residential developments and to the belief that segregated housing was undemocratic. The study was published under the title Interracial Housing by the University of Minnesota Press in May of that year. In a 1951 newspaper interview with Louis Danzing, the Director for the segregated housing projects stated that, \\"The study has served as a catalyst to the re- examination of our basic interracial policies in housing and as a stimulus to their change. Many of us have long felt that artificial separation of colored and white families was an unwholesome procedure. However until the study of Dr. Deutsch and Mrs. Collins, we had no scientific evidence to substantiate our feelings.\\" Modern commentators have accredited Deutsch's research as a valuable contribution to the end of segregation policies in the United States. In 1951 Deutsch also published the textbook Research Methods in Social Relations with coauthors Marie Jahoda and Stuart W. Cook, a book that would go on to three editions over the following twenty-five years. In 1954, Deutsch began studying at the Postgraduate Center for Psychotherapy, where he graduated as a professionally trained psychoanalytic psychotherapist in 1957. In addition to his work as a social psychologist, he conducted a small practice as a psychotherapist until his retirement in the late 1980s. In 1956, he joined the staff of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, where he did research on interpersonal bargaining and small group processes. While at Bell one of the more prominent experiments he conducted was the Acme-Bolt Trucking game, which concluded that when an individual has the opportunity to apply threat to another in competition they will use it and that this threatening behavior does not lead to cooperation. Deutsch also co-edited the book Preventing World War III in 1962. This work continued from his initial concerns with nuclear warfare, including the idea of nuclear deterrence. As an expert in social psychology, he began appearing on television to discuss the developing field. Career at Columbia University In 1963 he made what would be his final move between institutions, when he started at Teachers College, Columbia University after being invited to found a new social psychology doctoral program. The two major works that resulted of his studies during this period are considered to be The Resolution of Conflict (published in 1973) and Distributive Justice (published in 1985). However he also published the book Theories in Social Psychology (1965) and Applying Social Psychology (1975) during this same period. Deutsch was the first psychologist to use the Prisoner's Dilemma to study trust between small groups or pairings of individuals. During this period his work in conflict resolution continued to grow in influence, including his differentiation between constructive conflict and destructive conflict. The impact of his work was seen both in theory and in practice‚Äîfor example, in 1989 both Janusz Grzelak (a leading figure of the Solidarity movement in Poland) and Janusz Reykowski (a leading figure of the Communist Party of Poland) cited Deutsch's work as part of the infrastructure for the peaceful transfer of power from the Communists to the people. Deutsch was appointed Edward Lee Thorndike Professor of Psychology and Education in 1981, and delivered his inaugural address on April 22, 1982. Through his work during this phase of his career, he became known as an authority in the fields of conflict resolution, social justice, intergroup relations, and social psychology. In 1986 Deutsch founded the International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution (ICCCR) at Columbia. The goal of the Center was to integrate the theory of conflict resolution with its actual practice. For example, in 1987 the Center was involved in training teachers in Long Island and New Jersey to deal with inter-student and gang violence in lower-income communities. His work in this period also revolved around the concept of \\"distributive justice\\", relating to the distribution of goods and conditions affecting the well-being of individuals in a group, as a separate concept from procedural justice. This research culminated in his 1985 book Distributive Justice. Another major theme of his work was the concept of \\"Crude Law\\", which studied the relationships between attitudes, behavior, and relationships. Through his research Deutsch determined that the typical effects of a given relationship tend to induce that relationship. Thus, the typical effects of cooperation induce friendly, helpful behavior and friendly, helpful behavior will induce a cooperative relationship. His Crude Law as well as his research into distributive justice expanded the breadth of his body of work in the field of conflict resolution. Late career Deutsch is also a founding member of the World Dignity University initiative and Global Advisory Board Member of the Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies organization. Variously Deutsch has also been President of the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, the International Society of Political Psychology, several divisions of the American Psychological Association (APA), as well as the Eastern Psychological Association and New York State Psychological Association. In 2005 the ICCCR inaugurated the annual Morton Deutsch Award, provided to both a scholar-practitioner in the field of social justice and also to the winner of a student paper competition. The ceremony for the awards is held each year in the month of April. The International Society for Justice Research also inaugurated a Morton Deutsch Award in 2004, for the best article published in Social Justice Research. The Society for the Study of Peace, Conflict, and Violence: Peace Psychology Division of APA also offers an annual Morton Deutsch Conflict Resolution Award funded by the royalties of Deutsch's book Handbook of Conflict Resolution: Theory and Practice, given to a practitioner that contributes to the theory of the field of conflict resolution or vice versa. Deutsch officially retired from teaching in 1990 but has authored more than 50 papers or book chapters between his retirement and 2007, as well as many more in recent years. Over his career he mentored nearly 70 PhD students, most of them at Teachers College. In 2005 author Erica Frydenberg wrote a biography on Deutsch entitled Morton Deutsch: a Life and Legacy of Mediation and Conflict Resolution and in 2011 Peter Coleman edited the book Conflict, Interdependence, and Justice: The Intellectual Legacy of Morton Deutsch. Articles profiling his life were also written in 2006 by John Jost and in an issue dedicated to his life in the journal Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology. The Columbia University Libraries house the Morton Deutsch Collection, which consists of a print and online archive of his work. Since his retirement he has served at Columbia as E.L. Thorndike Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Education. Awards In 1969 Deutsch was awarded the Kurt Lewin Memorial Award, named for his PhD mentor at MIT. He was awarded the 1993 and inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award given out every two years by the International Association for Conflict Management. His citation for the award stated that Deutsch had also won \\"the G. W. Allport Prize, the Carl Hovland Memorial Award, and the AAAS Socio-psychological Prize, to mention a few. Dr. Deutsch has received several lifetime achievement awards for his work on conflict management, cooperative learning, peace psychology, and the applications of psychology to social issues\\". Deutsch was the recipient of the Teachers College Medal for Distinguished Service to Education, Helsinki University Medal for his contributions to psychology, and an honorary doctorate from his alma mater CCNY. Deutsch received distinguished scientific contribution awards from three professional societies: the Society of Experimental Social Psychology in 1985; the American Psychological Association in 1987; and the William James Fellow Award of the Association for Psychological Science. He was the winner of the 1961 AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research.History & Archives: AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research Deutsch was also awarded the 2006 James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award from the Association for Psychological Science. In addition to receiving these awards, he has been honored by the establishment of the Morton Deutsch Conflict Resolution Award by the International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution.ISJR site  Books by Morton Deutsch  * Deutsch, M.

It may be seen in association with thrombocytopenia, anemia, purpura and kidney failure. The classic TMAs are hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Other conditions with TMA include atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, scleroderma renal crisis, malignant hypertension, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and drug toxicities, e.g. calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. Signs and symptoms The clinical presentation of TMA, although dependent on the type, typically includes: fever, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (see schistocytes in a blood smear), kidney failure, thrombocytopenia and neurological manifestations. Generally, renal complications are particularly predominant with Shiga-toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (STx-HUS) and atypical HUS, whereas neurologic complications are more likely with TTP. Individuals with milder forms of TTP may have recurrent symptomatic episodes, including seizures and vision loss. With more threatening cases of TMA, and also as the condition progresses without treatment, multi-organ failure or injury is also possible, as the hyaline thrombi can spread to and affect the brain, kidneys, heart, liver, and other major organs. Cause The specific cause is dependent of the type of TMA that is presented, but the two main pathways that lead to TMA are external triggers of vascular injury, such as viruses, bacterial Shiga toxins or endotoxins, antibodies, and drugs; and congenital predisposing conditions, including decreased levels of tissue factors necessary for the coagulation cascade. Either of these pathways will result in decreased endothelial thromboresistance, leukocyte adhesion to damaged endothelium, complement consumption, enhanced vascular shear stress, and abnormal vWF fragmentation. The central and primary event in this progression is injury to the endothelial cells, which reduces the production of prostaglandin and prostacyclin, ultimately resulting in the loss of physiological thromboresistance, or high thrombus formation rate in blood vessels. Leukocyte adhesion to the damaged endothelial wall and abnormal von Willebrand factor (or vWF) release can also contribute to the increase in thrombus formation. More recently, researchers have attributed both TTP and HUS to targeted agents, such as targeted cancer therapies, immunotoxins, and anti-VEGF therapy. Bacterial toxins are the primary cause of one category of thrombotic microangiopathy known as HUS or hemolytic uremic syndrome. HUS can be divided into two main categories: Shiga- toxin-associated HUS (STx-HUS), which normally presents with diarrhea, and atypical HUS. The Shiga-toxin inhibits the binding of eEF-1-dependent binding of aminoacyl tRNA to the 60S subunit of the ribosome, thus inhibiting protein synthesis. The cytotoxicity from the lack of protein damages glomerular endothelial cells by creating voids in the endothelial wall and detaching the basement membrane of the endothelial layer, activating the coagulation cascade. Atypical HUS may be caused by an infection or diarrheal illness or it may be genetically transmitted. This category of TMA encompasses all forms that do not have obvious etiologies. Mutations in three of the proteins in the complement cascade have been identified in patients with atypical HUS. Several chemotherapeutic drugs have also been shown to cause damage to the epithelial layer by reducing the ability for the cells to produce prostacyclin, ultimately resulting in chemotherapy-associated HUS, or C-HUS. The second category of TMAs is TTP thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which can be divided into 3 categories: congenital, idiopathic, and non-idiopathic. Congenital and idiopathic TTP are generally associated with deficiencies in ADAMTS13, a zinc metalloprotease responsible for cleaving Very Large vWF Multimers in order to prevent inappropriate platelet aggregation and thrombosis in the microvasculature. Natural genetic mutations resulting in the deficiency of ADAMTS13 have been found in homozygous and heterozygous pedigrees in Europe. Researchers have identified common pathways and links between TTP and HUS, while other sources express skepticism about their common pathophysiology. The repression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can also cause glomerular TMA (damage to the glomerular microvasculature). It is likely that the absence of VEGF results in the collapse of fenestrations in the glomerular endothelium, thus causing microvascular injury and blockages associated with TMA. Manifestations resembling thrombotic microangiopathy have been reported in clinical trials evaluating high doses of Valacyclovir (8000 mg/day) administered for prolonged periods (months to years) for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease, particularly in persons with HIV infection. A number of factors may have contributed to the incidence of thrombotic microangiopathy in those trials including profound immunosuppression, underlying diseases (advanced HIV disease, graft-versus-host disease), and other classes of drug, particularly antifungal agents. There were no reports of thrombotic microangiopathy among the 3050 subjects in the four trials evaluating Valacyclovir for suppression of recurrent genital herpes. Although one of the trials was in HIV-infected subjects, the patients did not have advanced HIV disease. The implication is that the occurrence of thrombotic microangiopathy is restricted to severely immunosuppressed persons receiving higher Valacyclovir dosages than are required to control HSV infection.Bell WR, Chulay JD, Feinberg JE. Manifestations resembling thrombotic microangiopathy in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease in a cytomegalovirus prophylaxis trial (ACTG 204), Medicine, 1997, Vol. 76 (pp. 369-80) Diagnosis CBC and blood film: decreased platelets and schistocytes PT, aPTT, fibrinogen: normal markers of hemolysis: increased unconjugated bilirubin, increased LDH, decreased haptoglobin negative Coombs test.Creatinine, urea, to follow renal function ADAMSTS-13 gene, activity or inhibitor testing (TTP). Treatment The course of treatment and the success rate is dependent on the type of TMA. Some patients with atypical HUS and TTP have responded to plasma infusions or exchanges, a procedure which replaces proteins necessary for the complement cascade that the patient does not have; however, this is not a permanent solution or treatment, especially for patients with congenital predispositions. Monoclonal antibodies like Eculizumab and Caplacizumab can assist with aHUS and aTTP respectively whilst Dexamethasone can help with iTTP and low molecular weight Heparin can help with DIC.

It is the third iteration of what was originally a lightship, the Aurora Borealis, and remains an aid to navigation.  History  The first Pensacola Light was the lightship Aurora Borealis. It was moved to Pensacola in 1823 from its previous post at the mouth of the Mississippi River after a lighthouse had been completed there. Because of frequent rough seas, the lightship had to be anchored inside the bay entrance, behind Santa Rosa Island, and could not reliably be seen from ships outside the bay. = Tower = In 1825 a tower was built on a bluff at the south entrance to Pensacola Bay. This light was also partially obscured by trees close to the tower and on Santa Rosa Island. In 1858 a new tower was built on the north side of the bay entrance, and was lit on January 1, 1859. The new, and current, tower is tall, and also sits on a bluff located on the Pensacola Naval Air Station, placing the light above sea level. The current Pensacola Lighthouse The Pensacola Bar Beacon, with the Pensacola Lighthouse in the background The new location allowed the tower to serve as the rear range light marking the passage across the Pensacola Bar. Little is known of the first front range light. In 1879 a new front range beacon was erected southeast of the light tower. This light, known as the Pensacola Bar Beacon, was a square pyramidal wooden tower, tall, sitting on a point above sea level, so that the light was above the water. It had a sixth order Fresnel lens, and showed a fixed white light visible for . The Pensacola Bar Beacon was removed from service and demolished some time in the early 1900s. At the start of the Civil War, Pensacola was controlled by Confederate forces, while Fort Pickens across the bay remained in Union hands. Confederate authorities removed the lens from the lighthouse, and most of the lighthouse supplies were requisitioned for the war effort. In November 1861 an artillery duel between the two forces damaged the lighthouse tower. Confederate forces later evacuated Pensacola, and were replaced by Union forces. In 1863 the Pensacola Light was relit using a fourth-order Fresnel lens. A new first-order lens was placed in the tower in 1869. The tower was all white during the Civil War. Later, the upper two-thirds of the tower was painted black. Electricity was introduced to the lighthouse in 1939, eliminating the need to rewind the light rotation clockworks every 4¬Ω hours. The light was automated in 1965. The lighthouse tower and associated buildings were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

Their interests lay in the system of criminal justice and penology and indirectly, through the proposition that \\"man is a calculating animal\\", in the causes of criminal behavior. The Classical School of thought was premised on the idea that people have free will in making decisions, and that punishment can be a deterrent for crime, so long as the punishment is proportional, fits the crime, and is carried out promptly. Reform The system of law, its mechanisms of enforcement and the forms of punishment used in the 18th century were primitive and inconsistent . Judges were not professionally trained so many of their decisions were unsatisfactory being the product of incompetence, capriciousness, corruption, and political manipulation. The use of torture to extract confessions and a wide range of cruel punishments such as whipping, mutilation, and public executions was commonplace. A need for legal rationality and fairness was identified and found an audience among the emerging middle-classes whose economic interests lay in providing better systems for supporting national and international trade. The social contract John Locke considered the mechanism that had allowed monarchies to become the primary form of government. He concluded that monarchs had asserted the right to rule and enforced it either through an exercise in raw power or through a form of contract, e.g. the feudal system had depended on the grants of estates inland as a return for services provided to the sovereign. Locke proposed that all citizens are equal and that there is an unwritten but voluntary contract between the state and its citizens, giving power to those in government and defining a framework of mutual rights and duties. In Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes wrote, \\"the right of all sovereigns is derived from the consent of every one of those who are to be governed.\\" This is a shift from authoritarianism to an early model of European and North American democracy where police powers and the system of punishment are means to a more just end. Beccaria In 1764, he published Dei Delitti e Delle Pene (\\"On Crimes and Punishments\\") arguing for the need to reform the criminal justice system by referring not to the harm caused to the victim, but to the harm caused to society. In this, he explains that the greatest deterrent was the certainty of detection: the more swift and certain the punishment, the more effective it would be. It would also allow a less serious punishment to be effective if shame and an acknowledgement of wrongdoing was a guaranteed response to society's judgment. Thus, the prevention of crime was achieved through a proportional system that was clear and simple to understand, and if the entire nation united in their own defense. His approach influenced the codification movement which set sentencing tariffs to ensure equality of treatment among offenders. Later, it was acknowledged that not all offenders are alike and greater sentencing discretion was allowed to judges. Thus, punishment works at two levels. Because it punishes individuals, it operates as a specific deterrence to those convicted not to reoffend. But the publicity surrounding the trial and the judgment of society represented by the decision of a jury of peers, offers a general example to the public of the consequences of committing a crime. If they are afraid of similarly swift justice, they will not offend. Bentham In this context, the most relevant idea was known as the \\"felicitation principle\\" of utilitarianism, i.e. that whatever is done should aim to give the greatest happiness to the largest possible number of people in society. Bentham argued that there had been \\"punishment creep\\", i.e. that the severity of punishments had slowly increased so that the death penalty was then imposed for more than two hundred offences in England. For example, if rape and homicide were both punished by death, then a rapist would be more likely to kill the victim (as a witness) to reduce the risk of arrest. Bentham posited that man is a calculating animal who will weigh potential gains against the pain likely to be imposed. If the pain outweighs the gains, he will be deterred and this produces maximal social utility. Therefore, in a rational system, the punishment system must be graduated so that the punishment more closely matches the crime. Punishment is not retribution or revenge because that is morally deficient: the hangman is paying the murder the compliment of imitation. But the concept is problematic because it depends on two critical assumptions: *if deterrence is going to work, the potential offender must always act rationally whereas much crime is a spontaneous reaction to a situation or opportunity; and *if the system graduates a scale of punishment according to the seriousness of the offence, it is assuming that the more serious the harm likely to be caused, the more the criminal has to gain. Spiritual explanation of crime Spiritualistic understandings of crime stem from an understanding of life in general, that finds most things in life are destined and cannot be controlled, we are born either male or female, good or bad and all our actions are decided by a higher being. People have held such beliefs for all of recorded history; ‚Äúprimitive people regarded natural disasters such as famines, floods and plagues as punishments for wrongs they had done to the spiritual powers‚Äù.Vold, G. Bernard, T. and Snipes, J. (1998) Theoretical Criminology. Oxford University Press, Oxford. These spiritual powers gained strength during the Middle Ages as they bonded with the feudal powers to create the criminal justice system. Under a spiritualistic criminal justice system, crime was a private affair that was conducted between the offender and the victim‚Äôs family. However, this method proved to be too vengeful, as the state took control of punishment. Spiritual explanations provided an understanding of crime when there was no other way of explaining crime. The problem with this understanding is that it cannot be proven true, and so it was never accepted. Commentary The idea of man as a calculating animal requires the view of crime as a product of a free choice by offenders. The question for policy makers is therefore how to use the institutions of the state to influence citizens to choose not to offend. This theory emerged at the time of the Enlightenment and it contended that it should focus on rationality. But, because it lacks sophistication, it was the operationalised in a mechanical way, assuming that there is a mathematics of deterrence, i.e. a proportional calculation undertaken first by policy makers and then by potential offenders. This School believed that there are constants of value in pain and gain that can swing a decision to offend or not to offend. Not everyone is the same, however, nor has the same view of what constitutes a price worth paying. It also had a certain utopianism in assuming that the policing system could rapidly grow and deliver a better service of investigation and detection. If certainty of punishment is to be achieved, there must be a major investment in policing. As other Schools of thought developed, Classicism slowly grew less popular. It has seen revival through the Neo-Classical School and the theories of Right Realism such as the Rational Choice Theory. Burke, Roger Hopkins. An Introduction to Criminological Theory.

In September 2008, Les Brasseries Du Cameroun announced its acquisition of the majority shares in SIAC Isenbeck, which is a subsidiary of the Germany-based group Warsteiner. This is in a major move by Warsteiner to re-orient the management of its interests in Africa through decentralisation and partnership. SIAC Isenbeck which started activities in Cameroon about a decade ago suffered a significant setback a few years later. This led to the company‚Äôs inactivity for a while after which it resurfaced.Eden Newspaper - Brasseries Buys Over SIAC-Isenbeck. Retrieved on 2008-10-26 Company history Les Brasseries was founded in 1948 as a subsidiary of the French company les Brasseries et Glaceries d'Indochine (BGI). The company's first factory was in Douala, and others opened in Yaound√©, then Garoua, Bafoussam, and finally Limbe. Healthy profits and growth allowed the company to set up its own subsidiaries, including Tangui mineral water and a glass bottle plant. Les Brasseries was the only provider of such bottles within Cameroon, so even its competitors relied on it for these. Les Brasseries enjoyed a monopoly on the Cameroonian market until 1982 when Nouvelles brasseries africaines (NOBRA) began production. In 1987, les Brasseries intensified its activities. However, la Crise, a nationwide recession, hit that same year, and les Brasseries du Cameroun struggled to remain profitable for the better part of the next decade. The company's multiple factories gave it a decisive edge over its competition by greatly easing distribution across the country. Even when SBAC was forced to close its Limbe brewery, it still had three plants. As Cameroon's economy recovered somewhat in 1995, les Brasseries recovered as well. This was partially due to increased utilisation of locally available materials such as maize instead of imported barley. By 1997, the company's financial situation was comparable to what it had been a decade earlier, although the number of bottles brewed was only about half of what it had been in 1987. Les Brasseries du Cameroun's parent company, BGI, was purchased by the Castel Group, a company better known for its wines, in 1990. By the end of the decade, les Brasseries had captured 70% of Cameroon's alcoholic beverage market and 80% of the soft drink market. In 1994, SABC figures indicated that the brewery had produced 207,500,000 L of beer and 56,000,000 L of soft drinks.

The pottery operated from 1948-1966 in Santurce, Puerto Rico. It was a small pottery associated with and managed by master potter and ceramicist Hal Lasky (May 27, 1921- December 11, 2010).Harold Moses \\"Hal\\" Lasky Lasky won scholarships in the early and mid-1940s at several prestigious ceramic arts programs: Dartmouth College, University of the Arts (Philadelphia) (where he studied under Aurelius Renzetti (1897‚Äì1975)), the ceramics school at Alfred University (Alfred, New York) and the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Also, he exhibited at the Ceramic Nationals at Syracuse's Everson Museum of Art in both 1947 and 1948. In December 1947 Lasky was asked by Teodoro Moscoso, architect of the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company's Operation Bootstrap, to come to Puerto Rico to manage a small ceramic operation the Puerto Rican government had recently established. The operation had been supervised originally by the husband and wife team of Edwin Scheier and Mary Goldsmith. In 1948 the operation was privatized and funded by a private bank. The pottery produced a line of hand crafted terra cotta dinnerware and artware. Common dinnerware shapes were mugs, cups, tumblers, plates, bowls (covered and uncovered), tureens, casserole dishes, trays, teapots and pitchers. Artware shapes included vases of various size, ashtrays, hooded candle holders, planters, incense pots, candelabra and lamp bases. The most common design patterns are sgraffito shapes, symbols, and stylized figures of fruit and animals. Less common are inscriptions in English and Spanish or contours of human faces. Colors used in the glazes ranged from red, red and black, blue, blue and green, black, green, yellow, peach, teal, turquoise, as well as other colors. Although all pieces were pressed not thrown, each piece was individually designed, painted and woodfired ‚Äîunique forms of art on their own. Lasky developed a one step firing process that enabled him to produce pottery inexpensively and quickly. Production of Pieces The pieces were shaped and designed with the intent of reflecting artistically the best traditions of Puerto Rican culture and history. Lasky encouraged the artisans he stewarded to express themselves as they saw fit. Theirs was a collaborative effort. In a 2004 account Lasky wrote: \\" The first thing I did was to take away all the Pre-Columbian patterns they had been working with and in my halting Spanish told them they were now free to design anything they wanted at anytime. They were obviously shaken; for them \\"designers\\" were either god-like people or Americans and they immediately began to copy the cheap seconds that at that time flooded Puerto Rico. I let them get that out of their systems and some three months later they began designing things they thought would please me. \\"Little by little I began encouraging them to use \\"found tools:\\" a broken hair comb - I picked up from the floor in front of them, used and discarded pencils - showing them the faceted sides and rounded eraser end as options. One of the best tools turned out to be old fashioned hair pins women wore in the forties. \\"What emerged was an expression which can properly be described as a considerable leap beyond sgraffito. When using colored engobes (thin coatings of different colored clays over the redware clay body we were using) instead of thinly scratching through to reveal the contrasting red clay beneath they made strong, broad, energetic sculptural carvings if you will. Matte glazes were used almost invariably to more thoroughly reveal the sculptural \\"carving\\" technique. Each person signed their own design work and had the satisfaction of seeing their initials permanently fired into their pieces. They were free at any time to stop any work they were doing and create their own designs. \\"During this period of time I made it my business to keep away from the work table area where they did the designing. I didn't want even my presence near them to interfere with their own self expression. I would wait until they had left for the day to go into the damp room where the daily work was placed for slow initial drying to see what creatively had emerged.

It functions to shorten the vocal folds. Structure It arises in front from the lower half of the angle of the thyroid cartilage, and from the middle cricothyroid ligament. Its fibers pass backward and laterally, to be inserted into the base and anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage. =Parts= The lower and deeper fibers of the muscle can be differentiated as a triangular band which is inserted into the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage, and into the adjacent portion of its anterior surface; it is termed the Vocalis, and lies parallel with the vocal ligament, to which it is adherent.Frank H. Netter, MD \\"Atlas of Human anatomy\\", 7th Edition, 2019, Plate 91, superior view The vocal muscle is the upper portion of the thyroarytenoid muscle which is primarily involved in producing speech. A considerable number of the fibers of the thyroarytenoid muscle are prolonged into the aryepiglottic fold, where some of them become lost, while others are continued to the margin of the epiglottis. They have received a distinctive name, thyroepiglottic muscle, thyreoepiglotticus or thyroepiglottic, and are sometimes described as a separate muscle. A few fibers extend along the wall of the ventricle from the lateral wall of the arytenoid cartilage to the side of the epiglottis and constitute the ventricularis muscle. Function The thyroarytenoid muscle, consisting of two parts having different attachments and different directions, is rather complicated as regards its action. Its main use is to draw the arytenoid cartilages forward toward the thyroid, and thus relax and shorten the vocal folds. But, owing to the connection of the deeper portion with the vocal fold, this part, if acting separately, is supposed to modify its elasticity and tension, while the lateral portion rotates the arytenoid cartilage inward, and thus narrows the rima glottidis by bringing the two vocal folds together.

She was believed to be a security risk by the FBI and her superiors at the Signal Corps, and was questioned by United States Senator Joseph McCarthy in his role as the chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The highly publicized case was damaging to McCarthy's popularity and influence. Early years She was born as Annie Lee Crawford in 1905 in South Carolina. She had six siblings, and her father was a tenant farmer. Her family moved to North Carolina, where she left high school to work as a domestic servant and a laundress. She married Ernest Moss in 1926, and they moved to Durham, North Carolina, where she worked in the tobacco industry. Career Moss began her career in the federal government as a dessert cook in government cafeterias. In 1945, she moved to a job as a clerk in the General Accounting Office and in 1949 secured a civil-service position as an Army Signal Corps communications clerk at the Pentagon. A widowed mother, Moss had steadily improved her position since moving to Washington, DC, in the early 1940s. She bought a home in 1950, and by 1954 had an annual income of $3,300 (about $ today) a year, well above the median for black women at the time. In accordance with a loyalty review program introduced by President Harry S. Truman in 1947, Moss was investigated by the loyalty board of the General Accounting Office in October 1949. The next year, when Moss was promoted to communications clerk at the Pentagon, she was reinvestigated by the Army's Loyalty-Security Screening Board. The result of this investigation was that Moss was suspended from her position with the recommendation that she be discharged. She appealed this decision and was cleared by the Army board in January 1951. Charges, appearance before McCarthy In September 1951, the FBI notified the General Accounting Office of evidence Moss had been a member of the Communist Party in the mid-1940s, but at that time the army did not reopen the case. This evidence came from Mary Stalcup Markward, who, working as an informant for the FBI, had joined the Communist Party from 1943 to 1949. Markward held such positions as membership director and treasurer for the party. She reported regularly to the FBI, gave them copies of party documents, membership lists, and detailed accounts of meetings and activities. In February 1954, Markward testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Although she could not identify Moss personally, she testified that she had seen Annie Lee Moss's name and address on the Communist Party's membership rolls in 1944. At this point, Moss came to Senator Joseph McCarthy's attention. McCarthy, in his capacity as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, was looking into charges of Communist infiltration of the army, specifically at the Army Signal Corps laboratories at Fort Monmouth. Moss and her attorney, George E.C. Hayes, appeared before McCarthy's committee on March 11, 1954, at a session open to the public. McCarthy had made headlines with the case, claiming that Moss was \\"handling the encoding and decoding of confidential and top-secret messages\\". This was incorrect, as the Army pointed out: Moss handled only unreadable, encrypted messages, and had no access to the Pentagon code room. McCarthy left the hearing room shortly after Moss's testimony began, leaving his chief counsel Roy Cohn to handle the rest of the questioning. Moss was a small, soft-spoken, and seemingly timid woman who appeared to be a far cry from the intellectuals and political activists who were usually the target of McCarthy's investigations. She stated that she rarely read newspapers and had not even heard of Communism until 1948. She had difficulty with multisyllable words when asked to read a document before the committee, and responded \\"Who's that?\\" when asked if she knew who Karl Marx was, evoking laughter from the audience. She denied the charges, saying, \\"Never at any time have I been a member of the Communist Party and I have never seen a Communist Party card\\", and \\"I didn't subscribe to the Daily Worker and I wouldn't pay for it\\". Cohn's examination of Moss quickly ran into difficulty. After he noted that a \\"Communist activist\\" named Rob Hall was known to have visited Moss's home, it was pointed out (by Robert F. Kennedy, then the minority counsel for the committee) that two Rob Halls were in Washington: one was a known Communist who was white, and the other was a union organizer who was African American. Moss said that the Rob Hall she knew was \\"a man of about my complexion\\". As the hearing proceeded, it became clear that both the senators and the spectators were favoring Moss over Cohn and McCarthy. When Cohn asserted that he had corroboration of Markward's testimony from a confidential source, Senator John McClellan rebuked him for alluding to evidence he was not actually presenting. Cohn was probably referring to evidence taken by illegal break-in to offices of the Communist Party; the FBI commonly acquired evidence by such means, though it was legally inadmissible. Chairman Karl Mundt ruled that Cohn's comments be stricken from the record. McClellan responded: > You can't strike these statements made by counsel here as to evidence that > we're having and withholding. You cannot strike that from the press nor from > the public mind once it's planted there. That's the ‚Äì that is the ‚Äì evil of > it. I don't think it's fair to a witness, to a citizen of this country, to > bring them up here and cross-examine them, then when they get through, say > 'we've got something, the FBI's got something on you that condemns you.' It > is not sworn testimony. It is convicting people by rumor and hearsay and > innuendo. As had happened several times already, loud applause erupted from the spectators. Senator Stuart Symington then suggested that, as with Rob Hall, the case against Moss might be a matter of mistaken identity. Moss immediately agreed, saying three women named Annie Lee Moss were in Washington, DC.Although Washington city directories from the time listed several women with names similar to Moss's, they show only one \\"Annie Lee Moss\\". Symington said, \\"I may be sticking my neck out and I may be wrong, but I've been listening to you testify this afternoon and I think you're telling the truth.\\" Again there was loud and prolonged applause. =See It Now and other coverage= A cameraman from Edward R. Murrow's television show See It Now had filmed the Moss hearing, and the case was the subject of the episode broadcast on March 16, 1954. The previous week's show had been Murrow's famous \\"A Report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy\\" broadcast, which was deeply critical of McCarthy (and the subject of the 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck). Murrow opened the Annie Lee Moss show saying it would present a \\"little picture about a little woman\\", and closed it with a sound recording of a speech by Dwight D. Eisenhower in which the President praised the right of Americans to \\"meet your accuser face to face\\". The public's response to both shows was highly favorable, and because of them Murrow is widely credited with contributing to the eventual downfall of McCarthy. Support for Moss and criticism of McCarthy was widespread. In one of the more famous quotations from the McCarthy era, John Crosby wrote in the New York Herald Tribune, \\"The American People fought a revolution to defend, among other things, the right of Annie Lee Moss to earn a living, and Senator McCarthy now decided she has no such right.\\" Reporting on public opinion in McCarthy's home state, Drew Pearson wrote, \\"Wisconsin folks saw her as a nice old colored lady who wasn't harming anyone and they didn't like their senator picking on her\\". Aftermath of the hearing McCarthy's popularity was on the wane at the time of the Moss hearing, and the publicity around the case accelerated the process. He would soon be embroiled in the Army‚ÄìMcCarthy hearings which also significantly eroded his standing with the public and in the Senate. In December 1954, he was censured by the Senate, and spent the rest of his career in relative obscurity. He died in 1957. Moss had been suspended from her position when McCarthy announced his interest in the case. In January 1955, she was rehired to a nonsensitive position in the army's finance and accounts office, and she remained an army clerk until her retirement in 1975. She died in 1996, aged 90. Later evidence against Moss Since Markward's information included an address for Annie Lee Moss, and Moss confirmed this address in her testimony, the possibility of mistaken identity was never a very realistic one. In 1958, the Subversive Activities Control Board investigated a related case and confirmed Markward's testimony that Moss's name and address had appeared on the Communist party rolls in the mid-1940s. Several sources have reported this as proving that Moss was a Communist. More substantive is the evidence contained in Moss's FBI file, some of which was not revealed until the file was released through a Freedom of Information Act request. Andrea Friedman describes this evidence as \\"perhaps a dozen pieces of paper ‚Äì included a list of 'party recruits' that identified Moss by name, race, age, and occupation; membership lists from two Communist party branches, the Communist Political Association, and various ad hoc committees containing Moss's name and address, as well as the number of her Communist Party membership book; and receipt records from 1945 for Daily Worker subscriptions\\". Friedman concludes that Moss most likely had indirect contact with Communists through her cafeteria workers' union, and at most was probably a \\"casual recruit to the Communist Party, attracted by its social and economic justice politics\\", and later abandoned any associations with them. Current views Among some conservative authors, the evidence of Moss's Communist Party membership has been used as part of an attempted vindication of McCarthy.See Arthur Herman, Joseph McCarthy: Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator, M. Stanton Evans, Blacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy and His Fight Against America's Enemies, and Ann Coulter, Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism. While some have noted it as showing laxity on the part of the army's security review board, it has not changed the overall picture of McCarthy and his methods presented by the media. notes that it was \\"clearly not a case of mistaken identity\\", but does so in a footnote. refers to Moss's \\"probable\\" Communist Party membership as one of the \\"ironies\\" of the episode. , though not a defender of McCarthy, writes with amusement that Moss \\"donned a Sambo mask\\" to fool the gullible Democratic committee members.

Nugroho, (1992), Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Jaman Jepang dan zaman Republik Indonesia, PT Balai Pustaka, . Background: Rebellion of the colonels Prior to the establishment of the PRRI, there were several \\"rebellions\\" led by the various regional Army commanders in Sumatra. These events were the result of growing dissatisfaction with the Central Government and Indonesia's faltering economic development. The Central Government was seen by some in the outer islands (i.e. outside of Java) as disconnected from the Indonesian people. Some Army commands in the outer islands began covertly operating smuggling operations of Copra and contraband items to improve their financial position. These operations were soon followed with requests for greater economic and political autonomy from the Central Government in Jakarta. After their demands were not met they began to rebel against the government, conducting a series of bloodless coups within their regional command areas, and setting up alternative local government systems. The rebel army commands included: *Dewan Banteng (Banteng Council) in Central Sumatra which on 20 December 1956 under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad Hussein (Commander of the 4th regiment of the Territorial Army in Sumatra) began to take over the local government of Central Sumatra. *Dewan Gajah (Elephant Council) in East Sumatra which on 22 December 1956 under Colonel Maludin Simbolon (Supreme Commander of the Territorial Army in Sumatra) began to take over the local government in East Sumatra and cut all relation with the Central Government. *Dewan Garuda (Garuda Council) in South Sumatra which on 15 January 1957 under Lieutenant Colonel Barlian took over the local government of South Sumatra. *Dewan Manguni (Manguni Council) in North Sulawesi which on 20 December 1956 under Lieutenant Colonel Ventje Sumual took over the local government of North Sulawesi. It is important to note that Governor Roeslan, who yielded powers to Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad Husein, said that \\"the Banteng Council in particular and the people of Central Sumatra in general have no wish to build a State within a State, because relations between the Regional and the Central Government of the Republic of Indonesia will certainly return to normal when there is a Cabinet that can eliminate all the feelings of confusion, tension and dissatisfaction that threaten the security of the Indonesian State and People\\".Hasril Chaniago and Kahirul Jasmi.

The ultimatum demanded for three things. First, for the Djuanda Cabinet to return its mandate. Second, for Mohammad Hatta and the Sultan of Yogyakarta (Hamengkubuwono IX) to form a cabinet until a future election. Third, for President Sukarno to return to his constitutional position.Audrey R.

One of these unwilling parties was the Garuda Council led by Lieutenant Colonel Barlian. Even within Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad Hussein's Banteng Council, there were key leaders and segments who opposed the establishment of the PRRI. The lack of alienation from the political order of that time also meant that there was no real support or traction on the ground at all for such an open rebellion. Giving no slack to the PRRI, the Central Government in Jakarta also moved decisively against the PRRI, arresting several of the named cabinet ministers, discharging from service military commanders who supported the PRRI and bombing key infrastructure in Sumatra.Audrey R. Kahin, Rebellion to Integration: West Sumatra and the Indonesian Polity, p. 211. Beginning of the end The Central Government in Jakarta, having tolerated the dissident Army Councils for almost twelve months, promptly began preparations to militarily defeat the PRRI. The rebels had virtually no chance of success given the overwhelming superiority of the government forces. In addition, the military experience possessed by General Nasution, who was leading the government military forces, far exceeded that of Lieutenant Colonel Husein. The government military campaign that commenced on 12 March 1958 scored a quick victory in preventing the destruction of the Caltex oil fields and refinery in Pekanbaru by the PRRI forces. That attack also laid bare that the PRRI was receiving military aid from the United States, given the large amount of US-made equipment abandoned by the PRRI forces which had taken flight. The United States Government, especially the CIA (see CIA activities in Indonesia) had covertly supported the rebel PRRI Government in 1958, despite some dissent in the agency from Desmond Fitzgerald. With the Americans posturing to become directly involved in the crisis, General Nasution conducted surprise amphibious assaults on rebel cities in Sumatra during March 1958. With the military balance swiftly swinging in favour of the Central Government in Jakarta during the period March‚ÄìMay 1958, and the fact that Lieutenant Colonel Husein had little choice but to pursue a strategy of withdrawal and guerrilla warfare which would make it difficult for the United States to publicly recognise the PRRI,Audrey R. Kahin, Rebellion to Integration: West Sumatra and the Indonesian Polity, p. 215. the United States had to reconsider its previous policy assessment that the break-up of Indonesia and emergence of a Communist government was likely. The Pope incident on 18 May 1958 signalled the beginning of the end of the CIA's program of covert support to the PRRI, with the US shifting its support back towards Sukarno and the Central Government as the anticipated victor from the conflict. Surrender Although the conflict dragged on over the next three years, the government forces were successful in pushing the PRRI into the jungle and mountains, and retook several strongholds,Audrey R. Kahin, Rebellion to Integration: West Sumatra and the Indonesian Polity, p. 225. including Kototinggi where the PRRI leadership was headquartered. General Nasution, who was leading the government forces, launched Operasi Pemanggilan Kembali (Operation Call Back) at the end of 1960 to take advantage of internal rifts within the PRRI. The main objective of which was to persuade the army officers supporting the PRRI to surrender themselves, because once there was no longer military support, the civilians would also follow suit. Small numbers of PRRI troops began surrendering from April 1961, while the majority did so in the middle of 1961. The last vestiges of the PRRI held out for a few more months before the final surrender by Mohammad Natsir, who was the last of them, on 28 September 1961.Audrey R. Kahin, Rebellion to Integration: West Sumatra and the Indonesian Polity, p. 226-228. Legacy One of the most significant outcomes of the conflict was the establishment of Soviet arms aid to the Indonesian Government. As the crisis had unfolded, the Indonesian Government had approached the American Government for arms to combat the rebel commands. The Americans, however, had declined the Indonesian request, forcing the Indonesians to approach the Soviet Union for assistance. The Soviet Union thus became a major supplier of arms to the Indonesian Government, allowing Indonesia to rapidly modernize its armed forces into one of the strongest in Southeast Asia. This had follow on effects in the West New Guinea dispute as Indonesia was able to escalate tensions in the dispute by threatening overt conflict. Another important aspect was the influence of this event on the large exodus of Minangkabau people from Sumatra to other regions in Indonesia, along with the large psychological effects that stem from the attached stigma of being a rebel, despite the Minangkabau's determined resistance against the Dutch colonial system and the fact that many pre-Independence nationalistic leaders had hailed from Sumatra. In addition to the violence committed against the local community during and after the conflict period, the humiliation and trauma of the defeat had also rocked the self-esteem and dignity of the Minangkabau people.Syamdani, (2009), PRRI, pemberontakan atau bukan, Media Pressindo, . This was especially stark In an interview with Harun Zaid, where he said \\"What had an impact on me was the sadness in the eyes of the students. In 1961, the faces were dull as if they did not have any future\\".Audrey R. Kahin, Rebellion to Integration: West Sumatra and the Indonesian Polity, p. 229.

It has sometimes been assumed that \\"unlimited sexual license\\" was characteristic of ancient Rome.Edwards, p. 65. Verstraete and Proven√ßal opine that this perspective was simply a Christian interpretation: \\"The sexuality of the Romans has never had good press in the West ever since the rise of Christianity. In the popular imagination and culture, it is synonymous with sexual license and abuse.\\"Verstraete, Beert C. and , Vernon, eds. (2005) Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition. Haworth Press. p. 5. For an extended discussion of how the modern perception of Roman sexual decadence can be traced to early Christian polemic, see Alastair J. L. Blanshard, \\"Roman Vice,\\" in Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), pp. 1‚Äì88. But sexuality was not excluded as a concern of the mos maiorum, the traditional social norms that affected public, private, and military life.Karl-J. H√∂lkeskamp, Reconstructing the Roman Republic: An Ancient Political Culture and Modern Research (Princeton University Press, 2010), pp. 17‚Äì18. Pudor, \\"shame, modesty\\", was a regulating factor in behavior,Langlands, p. 17. as were legal strictures on certain sexual transgressions in both the Republican and Imperial periods.Langlands, p. 20. The censors‚Äîpublic officials who determined the social rank of individuals‚Äîhad the power to remove citizens from the senatorial or equestrian order for sexual misconduct, and on occasion did so.Fantham, p. 121Richlin (1993), p. 556. Under the Empire, the emperor assumed the powers of the censors (p. 560). The mid-20th-century sexuality theorist Michel Foucault regarded sex throughout the Greco-Roman world as governed by restraint and the art of managing sexual pleasure.Michel Foucault, The History of Sexuality: The Care of the Self (New York: Vintage Books, 1988), vol. 3, p. 239 (on the contrast with the Christian view of sex as \\"linked to evil\\") et passim, as summarized by Inger Furseth and P√•l Repstad, An Introduction to the Sociology of Religion: Classical and Contemporary Perspectives (Ashgate, 2006), p. 64. Roman society was patriarchal (see paterfamilias), and masculinity was premised on a capacity for governing oneself and others of lower status, not only in war and politics, but also in sexual relations.Cantarella, p. xii. Virtus, \\"virtue\\", was an active masculine ideal of self-discipline, related to the Latin word for \\"man\\", vir. The corresponding ideal for a woman was pudicitia, often translated as chastity or modesty, but a more positive and even competitive personal quality that displayed both her attractiveness and self-control.Langlands, pp. 37‚Äì38. Roman women of the upper classes were expected to be well educated, strong of character, and active in maintaining their family's standing in society.Cantarella, pp. xii‚Äìxiii. But with extremely few exceptions, surviving Latin literature preserves the voices only of educated male Romans on the subject of sexuality. Visual art was created by those of lower social status and of a greater range of ethnicity, but was tailored to the taste and inclinations of those wealthy enough to afford it, including, in the Imperial era, former slaves.Clarke, pp. 9, 153ff. Some sexual attitudes and behaviors in ancient Roman culture differ markedly from those in later Western societies.Langlands, p. 31, especially note 55Clarke, p. 11. Roman religion promoted sexuality as an aspect of prosperity for the state, and individuals might turn to private religious practice or \\"magic\\" for improving their erotic lives or reproductive health. Prostitution was legal, public, and widespread. \\"Pornographic\\" paintings were featured among the art collections in respectable upperclass households.McGinn (2004), p. 164. It was considered natural and unremarkable for men to be sexually attracted to teen-aged youths of both sexes, and pederasty was condoned as long as the younger male partner was not a freeborn Roman. \\"Homosexual\\" and \\"heterosexual\\" did not form the primary dichotomy of Roman thinking about sexuality, and no Latin words for these concepts exist.Williams, p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122. No moral censure was directed at the man who enjoyed sex acts with either women or males of inferior status, as long as his behaviors revealed no weaknesses or excesses, nor infringed on the rights and prerogatives of his masculine peers. While perceived effeminacy was denounced, especially in political rhetoric, sex in moderation with male prostitutes or slaves was not regarded as improper or vitiating to masculinity, if the male citizen took the active and not the receptive role. Hypersexuality, however, was condemned morally and medically in both men and women. Women were held to a stricter moral code, and same-sex relations between women are poorly documented, but the sexuality of women is variously celebrated or reviled throughout Latin literature. In general the Romans had more flexible gender categories than the ancient Greeks.Hallett, p. 11. A late-20th-century paradigm analyzed Roman sexuality in terms of a \\"penetrator‚Äìpenetrated\\" binary model, a misleadingly rigid analysis that may obscure expressions of sexuality among individual Romans.Langlands, p. 13. Even the relevance of the word \\"sexuality\\" to ancient Roman culture has been disputed,Clarke, p. 8, maintains that the ancient Romans \\"did not have a self-conscious idea of their sexuality\\".Penner, pp. 15‚Äì16Habinek, pp. 2ff. but in the absence of any other label for \\"the cultural interpretation of erotic experience\\", the term continues to be used.Edwards, pp. 66‚Äì67, especially note 12. Erotic literature and art Romantic scene from a mosaic (Villa at Centocelle, Rome, 20 BC‚Äì20 AD) Ancient literature pertaining to Roman sexuality falls mainly into four categories: legal texts; medical texts; poetry; and political discourse.Clarke, p. 9. Forms of expression with lower cultural cachet in antiquity‚Äîsuch as comedy, satire, invective, love poetry, graffiti, magic spells, inscriptions, and interior decoration‚Äîhave more to say about sex than elevated genres, such as epic and tragedy. Information about the sex lives of the Romans is scattered in historiography, oratory, philosophy, and writings on medicine, agriculture, and other technical topics.Potter (2009), p. 330. Legal texts point to behaviors Romans wanted to regulate or prohibit, without necessarily reflecting what people actually did or refrained from doing.Potter (2009), p. 331. Major Latin authors whose works contribute significantly to an understanding of Roman sexuality include: * the comic playwright Plautus (d. 184 BC), whose plots often revolve around sex comedy and young lovers kept apart by circumstances; * the statesman and moralist Cato the Elder (d. 149 BC), who offers glimpses of sexuality at a time that later Romans regarded as having higher moral standards; * the poet Lucretius (d. c. 55 BC), who presents an extended treatment of Epicurean sexuality in his philosophical work De rerum natura; * Catullus (fl. 50s BC), whose poems explore a range of erotic experience near the end of the Republic, from delicate romanticism to brutally obscene invective; * Cicero (d. 43 BC), with courtroom speeches that often attack the opposition's sexual conduct and letters peppered with gossip about Rome's elite; * the Augustan elegists Propertius and Tibullus, who reveal social attitudes in describing love affairs with mistresses; * Ovid (d. 17 AD), especially his Amores (\\"Love Affairs\\") and Ars Amatoria (\\"Art of Love\\"), which according to tradition contributed to Augustus's decision to exile the poet, and his epic, the Metamorphoses, which presents a range of sexuality, with an emphasis on rape, through the lens of mythology; * the epigrammatist Martial (d. c. 102/4 AD), whose observations of society are braced by sexually explicit invective; * the satirist Juvenal (d. early 2nd century AD), who rails against the sexual mores of his time. Ovid lists a number of writers known for salacious material whose works are now lost.Ovid, Tristia 2.431ff. Greek sex manuals and \\"straightforward pornography\\" were published under the name of famous heterai (courtesans), and circulated in Rome. The robustly sexual Milesiaca of Aristides was translated by Sisenna, one of the praetors of 78 BC. Ovid calls the book a collection of misdeeds (crimina), and says the narrative was laced with dirty jokes.Ovid, Tristia 2.413 and 443‚Äì444; Heinz Hofmann, Latin Fiction: The Latin Novel in Context (Routledge, 1999), p. 85. After the Battle of Carrhae, the Parthians were reportedly shocked to find the Milesiaca in the baggage of Marcus Crassus's officers.Plutarch, Life of Crassus 32. Erotic art, especially as preserved in Pompeii and Herculaneum, is a rich if not unambiguous source; some images contradict sexual preferences stressed in literary sources and may be intended to provoke laughter or challenge conventional attitudes.Clarke, p. 3. Everyday objects such as mirrors and serving vessels might be decorated with erotic scenes; on Arretine ware, these range from \\"elegant amorous dalliance\\" to explicit views of the penis entering the vagina.Clarke, p. 108. Erotic paintings were found in the most respectable houses of the Roman nobility, as Ovid notes: > Just as venerable figures of men, painted by the hand of an artist, are > resplendent in our houses, so too there is a small painting (tabella)The > tabella was a small, portable painting, as distinguished from an > architecturally permanent wall painting. in some spot which depicts various > couplings and sexual positions: just as Telamonian Ajax sits with an > expression that declares his anger, and the barbarian mother (Medea) has > crime in her eyes, so too a wet Venus dries her dripping hair with her > fingers and is viewed barely covered by the maternal waters.Ovid, Tristia 2, > as cited in Clarke, pp. 91‚Äì92. Erotic art on a wall of the House of the Centenary, Pompeii The pornographic tabella and the erotically charged Venus appear among various images that a connoisseur of art might enjoy.Clarke, p. 93. A series of paintings from the Suburban Baths at Pompeii, discovered in 1986 and published in 1995, presents erotic scenarios that seem intended \\"to amuse the viewer with outrageous sexual spectacle,\\" including a variety of positions, oral sex, and group sex featuring male‚Äìfemale, male‚Äìmale, and female‚Äìfemale relations.Clarke, pp. 3 and 212 ff., quotation on p. 216. The d√©cor of a Roman bedroom could reflect quite literally its sexual use: the Augustan poet Horace supposedly had a mirrored room for sex, so that when he hired a prostitute he could watch from all angles.As criticized by Suetonius, Life of Horace: Ad res Venerias intemperantior traditur; nam speculato cubiculo scorta dicitur habuisse disposita, ut quocumque respexisset ibi ei imago coitus referretur; Clarke, p. 92. The emperor Tiberius had his bedrooms decorated with \\"the most lascivious\\" paintings and sculptures, and stocked with Greek sex manuals by Elephantis in case those employed in sex needed direction.Suetonius, Life of Tiberius 44.2; Clarke, pp. 92‚Äì93. In the 2nd century AD, \\"there is a boom in texts about sex in Greek and Latin,\\" along with romance novels.Potter (2009), p. 329. But frank sexuality all but disappears from literature thereafter, and sexual topics are reserved for medical writing or Christian theology. In the 3rd century, celibacy had become an ideal among the growing number of Christians, and Church Fathers such as Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria debated whether even marital sex should be permitted for procreation. The sexuality of martyrology focuses on tests against the Christian's chastity and sexual torture; Christian women are more often than men subjected to sexual mutilation, in particular of the breasts.For example, Agatha of Sicily and Febronia of Nisibis; Sebastian P. Brock and Susan Ashbrook Harvey, introduction to Holy Women of the Syrian Orient (University of California Press, 1987), pp. 24‚Äì25; Harvey, \\"Women in Early Byzantine Hagiography: Reversing the Story,\\" in That Gentle Strength: Historical Perspectives on Women in Christianity (University Press of Virginia, 1990), pp. 48‚Äì50. The accounts of breast mutilation occur in Christian sources and iconography, not in Roman art and literature. The obscene humor of Martial was briefly revived in 4th-century Bordeaux by the Gallo-Roman scholar-poet Ausonius, although he shunned Martial's predilection for pederasty and was at least nominally a Christian.Potter (2009), p. 330. Although there is little question that Ausonius was a Christian, his works contain many indications that he remained at least interested in, if not a practitioner of, traditional Roman and Celtic religions. Sex, religion and the state A man prepares the nocturnal sacrifice of a pig to Priapus, with Cupid as the swineherdAnthony King, \\"Mammals,\\" in The Natural History of Pompeii (Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 444; John R. Clarke, The Houses of Roman Italy, 100 B.C.‚ÄìA.D. 250: Ritual, Space and Decoration (University of California Press, 1991), p. 97. (wall painting, Villa of the Mysteries) Like other aspects of Roman life, sexuality was supported and regulated by religious traditions, both the public cult of the state and private religious practices and magic. Sexuality was an important category of Roman religious thought.Staples The complement of male and female was vital to the Roman concept of deity. The Dii Consentes were a council of deities in male‚Äìfemale pairs, to some extent Rome's equivalent to the Twelve Olympians of the Greeks.Celia E. Schultz, Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), pp. 79‚Äì81; Michael Lipka, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach (Brill, 2009), pp. 141‚Äì142 At least two state priesthoods were held jointly by a married couple.See Flamen Dialis and rex sacrorum. The Vestal Virgins, the one state priesthood reserved for women, took a vow of chastity that granted them relative independence from male control; among the religious objects in their keeping was a sacred phallus:Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 53; Robin Lorsch Wildfang, Rome's Vestal Virgins: A Study of Rome's Vestal Priestesses in the Late Republic and Early Empire (Routledge, 2006), p. 20. \\"Vesta's fire ... evoked the idea of sexual purity in the female\\" and \\"represented the procreative power of the male\\".Staples, p. 149. The men who served in the various colleges of priests were expected to marry and have families. Cicero held that the desire (libido) to procreate was \\"the seedbed of the republic\\", as it was the cause for the first form of social institution, marriage. Marriage produced children and in turn a \\"house\\" (domus) for family unity that was the building block of urban life.Cicero, De officiis 1.17.54: nam cum sit hoc natura commune animantium, ut habeant libidinem procreandi, prima societas in ipso coniugio est, proxima in liberis, deinde una domus, communia omnia; id autem est principium urbis et quasi seminarium reipublicae; Sabine MacCormack, \\"Sin, Citizenship, and the Salvation of Souls: The Impact of Christian Priorities on Late-Roman and Post- Roman Society,\\" Comparative Studies in Society and History 39.4 (1997), p. 651. Many Roman religious festivals had an element of sexuality. The February Lupercalia, celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era, included an archaic fertility rite. The Floralia featured nude dancing. At certain religious festivals throughout April, prostitutes participated or were officially recognized.See also \\"Roman prostitution and religion\\". The connections among human reproduction, general prosperity, and the wellbeing of the state are embodied by the Roman cult of Venus, who differs from her Greek counterpart Aphrodite in her role as a mother of the Roman people through her half-mortal son Aeneas.As in the first-line invocation of Venus in Lucretius's epic De rerum natura: \\"Begetter (genetrix) of the line of Aeneas, the pleasure (voluptas) of human and divine.\\" During the civil wars of the 80s BC, Sulla, about to invade his own country with the legions under his command, issued a coin depicting a crowned Venus as his personal patron deity, with Cupid holding a palm branch of victory; on the reverse military trophies flank symbols of the augurs, the state priests who read the will of the gods. The iconography links deities of love and desire with military success and religious authority; Sulla adopted the title Epaphroditus, \\"Aphrodite's own\\", before he became a dictator.J. Rufus Fears, \\"The Theology of Victory at Rome: Approaches and Problem,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.17.2 (1981), pp. 791‚Äì795. Sulla himself may or may not have been an augur at this time. The fascinum, a phallic charm, was ubiquitous in Roman culture, appearing on everything from jewelry to bells and wind chimes to lamps,Williams, p. 92. including as an amulet to protect childrenMartin Henig, Religion in Roman Britain (London: Batsford, 1984), pp. 185‚Äì186. and triumphing generals.Pliny, Natural History 28.4.7 (28.39), says that when a general celebrated a triumph, the Vestals hung an effigy of the fascinus on the underside of his chariot to protect him from invidia. Denarius issued ca. 84‚Äì83 BC under Sulla picturing Venus with a diadem and a standing Cupid with a palm branch, and on the reverse two military trophies and religious implements (jug and lituus) Cupid inspired desire; the imported god Priapus represented gross or humorous lust; Mutunus Tutunus promoted marital sex. The god Liber (understood as the \\"Free One\\") oversaw physiological responses during sexual intercourse. When a male assumed the toga virilis, \\"toga of manhood,\\" Liber became his patron; according to the love poets, he left behind the innocent modesty (pudor) of childhood and acquired the sexual freedom (libertas) to begin his course of love.Iter amoris, \\"journey\\" or \\"course of love\\". See Propertius 3.15.3‚Äì6; Ovid, Fasti) 3.777‚Äì778; Michelle George, \\"The 'Dark Side' of the Toga,\\" in Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 55. Robert E. A. Palmer, \\"Mutinus Titinus: A Study in Etrusco-Roman Religion and Topography,\\" in Roman Religion and Roman Empire: Five Essays (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1974), pp. 187‚Äì206, argued that Mutunus Tutunus was subsumed by the cult of Liber; Augustine, De civitate Dei 7.21, said that a phallus was a divine object used during the Liberalia to repel malevolent influences from the crops. A host of deities oversaw every aspect of intercourse, conception, and childbirth.Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome (Routledge, 2001; originally published in French 1998), pp. 18‚Äì20; J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome: Rationalization and Ritual Change (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002), pp. 181‚Äì182. Classical myths often deal with sexual themes such as gender identity, adultery, incest, and rape. Roman art and literature continued the Hellenistic treatment of mythological figures having sex as humanly erotic and at times humorous, often removed from the religious dimension.Clarke, pp. 46‚Äì47. =Moral and legal concepts=Castitas The Latin word castitas, from which the English \\"chastity\\" derives, is an abstract noun denoting \\"a moral and physical purity usually in a specifically religious context\\", sometimes but not always referring to sexual chastity.Langlands, p. 30. The related adjective castus (feminine casta, neuter castum), \\"pure\\", can be used of places and objects as well as people; the adjective pudicus (\\"chaste, modest\\") describes more specifically a person who is sexually moral. The goddess Ceres was concerned with both ritual and sexual castitas, and the torch carried in her honor as part of the Roman wedding procession was associated with the bride's purity; Ceres also embodied motherhood.Barbette Stanley Spaeth, The Roman Goddess Ceres (University of Texas Press, 1996), pp. 115‚Äì116, citing Festus (87 in the edition of M√ºller) on the torch and noting that priestesses devoted to Ceres in North Africa took a vow of chastity like that of the Vestals (Tertullian, Ad uxorem 1.6 Oehler). Ovid notes that Ceres is pleased by even small offerings, as long as they are casta (Fasti 4.411‚Äì412). Statius says that Ceres herself is casta (Silvae 4.311). The goddess's concern with castitas may have to do with her tutelary function over boundaries, including the transition between life and death, as in the mystery religions. The goddess Vesta was the primary deity of the Roman pantheon associated with castitas, and a virgin goddess herself; her priestesses the Vestals were virgins who took a vow to remain celibate. Incestum A Vestal Incestum (that which is \\"not castum\\") is an act that violates religious purity, perhaps synonymous with that which is nefas, religiously impermissible.H.H.J. Brouwer, Bona Dea: The Sources and a Description of the Cult (Brill, 1989), pp. 367‚Äì367, note 319. The violation of a Vestal's vow of chastity was incestum, a legal charge brought against her and the man who rendered her impure through sexual relations, whether consensually or by force. A Vestal's loss of castitas ruptured Rome's treaty with the gods (pax deorum),Mueller, Roman Religion in Valerius Maximus, p. 51; Susanne William Rasmussen, Public Portents in Republican Rome (¬´L'Erma¬ª di Bretschneider, 2003), p. 41. and was typically accompanied by the observation of bad omens (prodigia). Prosecutions for incestum involving a Vestal often coincide with political unrest, and some charges of incestum seem politically motivated:Wildfang, Rome's Vestal Virgins, p. 82 et passim. Marcus Crassus was acquitted of incestum with a Vestal who shared his family name.Crassus's nomen was Licinius; the Vestal's name was Licinia (see Roman naming conventions). His reputation for greed and sharp business dealings helped save him; he objected that he had spent time with Licinia to obtain some real estate she owned. For sources, see Michael C. Alexander, Trials in the Late Roman Republic, 149 BC to 50 BC (University of Toronto Press, 1990), p. 84. The most likely year was 73 BC; Plutarch, Life of Crassus 1.2, implies that the prosecution was motivated by political utility. One or more Vestals were also brought before the College of Pontiffs for incestum in connection with the Catiline Conspiracy (Alexander, Trials, p. 83). Although the English word \\"incest\\" derives from the Latin, incestuous relations are only one form of Roman incestum, sometimes translated as \\"sacrilege\\". When Clodius Pulcher dressed as a woman and intruded on the all- female rites of the Bona Dea, he was charged with incestum.The sources on this notorious incident are numerous; Brouwer, Bona Dea, p. 144ff., gathers the ancient accounts. Stuprum In Latin legal and moral discourse, stuprum is illicit sexual intercourse, translatable as \\"criminal debauchery\\"Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A. J. McGinn, A Casebook on Roman Family Law (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 38 and 52. or \\"sex crime\\".Richlin (1983), p. 30. Stuprum encompasses diverse sexual offenses including incestum, rape (\\"unlawful sex by force\\"),Stuprum cum vi or per vim stuprum: Richlin (1993), p. 562. and adultery. In early Rome, stuprum was a disgraceful act in general, or any public disgrace, including but not limited to illicit sex.For instance, in the mid-3rd century BC, Naevius uses the word stuprum in his Bellum Punicum for the military disgrace of desertion or cowardice; Fantham, p. 117. By the time of the comic playwright Plautus (ca. 254‚Äì184 BC) it had acquired its more restricted sexual meaning.Fantham, p. 118. Stuprum can occur only among citizens; protection from sexual misconduct was among the legal rights that distinguished the citizen from the non-citizen. Although the noun stuprum may be translated into English as fornication, the intransitive verb \\"to fornicate\\" (itself derived from the Latin fornicarium, which originally meant \\"a vaulted room\\"; the small vaulted rooms in which some prostitutes plied their trade led to the verb fornicare) is an inadequate translation of the Latin stuprare, which is a transitive verb requiring a direct object (the person who is the target of the misconduct) and a male agent (the stuprator). Raptus The English word \\"rape\\" derives ultimately from the Latin verb rapio, rapere, raptus, \\"to snatch, carry away, abduct\\" (the words rapt, rapture, and raptor still have the same meaning). In Roman law, raptus or raptio meant primarily kidnapping or abduction;Diana C. Moses, \\"Livy's Lucretia and the Validity of Coerced Consent in Roman Law,\\" in Consent and Coercion to Sex and Marriage in Ancient and Medieval Societies (Dunbarton Oaks, 1993), p. 50; Gillian Clark, Women in Late Antiquity: Pagan and Christian Life-styles (Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 36. the mythological rape of the Sabine women is a form of bride abduction in which sexual violation is a secondary issue. (Before the word \\"rape\\" acquired its modern strictly sexual meaning, the verb meant simply to seize something or someone by force; this usage persisted at least into the early 19th century.) The abduction of an unmarried girl from her father's household in some circumstances was a matter of the couple eloping without her father's permission to marry. Rape in the English sense was more often expressed as stuprum committed through violence or coercion (cum vi or per vim). As laws pertaining to violence were codified toward the end of the Republic, raptus ad stuprum, \\"abduction for the purpose of committing a sex crime\\", emerged as a legal distinction.Moses, \\"Livy's Lucretia,\\" pp. 50‚Äì51. (See further discussion of rape under \\"The rape of men\\" and \\"Rape and the law\\" below.) =Healing and magic= Votive offerings from Pompeii representing breasts, penises, and a uterus Divine aid might be sought in private religious rituals along with medical treatments to enhance or block fertility, or to cure diseases of the reproductive organs. Votive offerings (vota; compare ex-voto) in the form of breasts and penises have been found at healing sanctuaries. A private ritual under some circumstances might be considered \\"magic\\", an indistinct category in antiquity.Hans Dieter Betz, The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation (University of Chicago Press, 1986, 1992), p. xliff. An amatorium (Greek philtron) was a love charm or potion;Matthew W. Dickie, Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World (Routledge, 2003), p. 16. binding spells (defixiones) were supposed to \\"fix\\" a person's sexual affection.Dickie, Magic and Magicians, p. 36. Defixiones are also known as curse tablets; erotic prohibitions are only one form of defixio. The Greek Magical Papyri, a collection of syncretic magic texts, contain many love spells that indicate \\"there was a very lively market in erotic magic in the Roman period\\", catered by freelance priests who at times claimed to derive their authority from the Egyptian religious tradition.Richard Gordon, \\"Innovation and Authority in Graeco-Egyptian Magic,\\" in Kykeon: Studies in Honour of H. S. Versnel (Brill, 2002), p. 72. Canidia, a witch described by Horace, performs a spell using a female effigy to dominate a smaller male doll.Christopher A. Faraone, \\"Agents and Victims: Constructions of Gender and Desire in Ancient Greek Love Magic,\\" in The Sleep of Reason, p. 410. Aphrodisiacs, anaphrodisiacs, contraceptives, and abortifacients are preserved by both medical handbooks and magic texts; potions can be difficult to distinguish from pharmacology. In his Book 33 De medicamentis, Marcellus of Bordeaux, a contemporary of Ausonius,Marcellus's work was \\"the last major compilation [of medical treatments] written in Gaul based on the work of ancient and contemporary Greek authors\\", notes Bonnie Effros, Creating Community with Food and Drink in Merovingian Gaul (Palgrave Macmillan, 2002), p. 55. Marcellus names the father of Ausonius in his preface. collected more than 70 sexually related treatments‚Äîfor growths and lesions on the testicles and penis, undescended testicles, erectile dysfunction, hydrocele, \\"creating a eunuch without surgery\\",Ut eunuchum sine ferro facias, \\"how you make a eunuch without the iron (blade)\\": Marcellus of Bordeaux, De medicamentis ensuring a woman's fidelity, and compelling or diminishing a man's desire‚Äîsome of which involve ritual procedures: > If you‚Äôve had a woman, and you don't want another man ever to get inside > her, do this: Cut off the tail of a live green lizard with your left hand > and release it while it‚Äôs still alive.

Marcellus also records which herbsIncluding artemisia, dittany, opopanax, pepper, saffron, giant fennel, myrrh, and colocynth; John M. Riddle, Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance (Harvard University Press, 1992), p. 90. could be used to induce menstruation, or to purge the womb after childbirth or abortion; these herbs include potential abortifacients and may have been used as such.Riddle, Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance, p. 91, noting that Marcellus \\"does not appear expertly knowledgeable about...women and fertility\\". Other sources advise remedies such as coating the penis with a mixture of honey and pepper to get an erection,The Paignia of Democritus, PGM 7.167‚Äì186, as cited by James N. Davidson, \\"Don't Try This at Home: Pliny's Salpe, Salpe's Paignia and Magic,\\" Classical Quarterly 45.2 (1995), p. 591. or boiling an ass's genitals in oil as an ointment.Pliny, Natural History 28.262, crediting Salpe the obstetrician, as cited by Davidson, \\"Don't Try This at Home,\\" p. 591. Theories of sexuality Ancient theories of sexuality were produced by and for an educated elite. The extent to which theorizing about sex actually affected behavior is debatable, even among those who were attentive to the philosophical and medical writings that presented such views. This elite discourse, while often deliberately critical of common or typical behaviors, at the same time cannot be assumed to exclude values broadly held within the society. =Epicurean sexuality= The fourth book of Lucretius' De rerum natura provides one of the most extended passages on human sexuality in Latin literature. Yeats, describing the translation by Dryden, called it \\"the finest description of sexual intercourse ever written.\\"Stuart Gillespie and Philip Hardie, introduction to The Cambridge Companion to Lucretius (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 12. Lucretius was the contemporary of Catullus and Cicero in the mid-1st century BC. His didactic poem De rerum natura is a presentation of Epicurean philosophy within the Ennian tradition of Latin poetry. Epicureanism is both materialist and hedonic. The highest good is pleasure, defined as the absence of physical pain and emotional distress.Epicurus, Letter to Menoeceus 131. The Epicurean seeks to gratify his desires with the least expenditure of passion and effort. Desires are ranked as those that are both natural and necessary, such as hunger and thirst; those that are natural but unnecessary, such as sex; and those that are neither natural nor necessary, including the desire to rule over others and glorify oneself.A scholiast gives an example of an unnatural and unnecessary desire as acquiring crowns and setting up statues for oneself; see J.M. Rist, Epicurus: An Introduction (Cambridge University Press, 1972), pp. 116‚Äì119. It is within this context that Lucretius presents his analysis of love and sexual desire, which counters the erotic ethos of Catullus and influenced the love poets of the Augustan period.Philip Hardie, \\"Lucretius and Later Latin Literature in Antiquity,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Lucretius, p. 121, note 32. Lucretius treats male desire, female sexual pleasure, heredity, and infertility as aspects of sexual physiology. In the Epicurean view, sexuality arises from impersonal physical causes without divine or supernatural influence. The onset of physical maturity generates semen, and wet dreams occur as the sexual instinct develops.Lucretius, De rerum natura, 4.1030‚Äì57Brown, pp. 62‚Äì63. Sense perception, specifically the sight of a beautiful body, provokes the movement of semen into the genitals and toward the object of desire. The engorgement of the genitals creates an urge to ejaculate, coupled with the anticipation of pleasure. The body's response to physical attractiveness is automatic, and neither the character of the person desired nor one's own choice is a factor. With a combination of scientific detachment and ironic humor, Lucretius treats the human sex drive as muta cupido, \\"dumb desire\\", comparing the physiological response of ejaculation to the blood spurting from a wound.Brown, pp. 63, 181‚Äì182. Love (amor) is merely an elaborate cultural posturing that obscures a glandular condition;Brown, p. 64. love taints sexual pleasure just as life is tainted by the fear of death.Brown, p. 65. Epicurus taught that the soul was a thin tissue of atoms that dissipated into the cosmos upon death; therefore, there is no afterlife and no reason for mortals to live with anxieties about what happens after death. Lucretius is writing primarily for a male audience, and assumes that love is a male passion, directed at either boys or women.Lucretius, De rerum natura 4.1053‚Äì1054Brown, p. 123. Male desire is viewed as pathological, frustrating, and violent.Brown, pp. 65‚Äì66. Lucretius thus expresses an Epicurean ambivalence toward sexuality, which threatens one's peace of mind with agitation if desire becomes a form of bondage and torment,Brown, p. 67. but his view of female sexuality is less negative. While men are driven by unnatural expectations to engage in onesided and desperate sex, women act on a purely animal instinct toward affection, which leads to mutual satisfaction.Brown, p. 66. The comparison with female animals in heat is meant not as an insult, though there are a few traces of conventional misogyny in the work, but to indicate that desire is natural and should not be experienced as torture. Having analyzed the sex act, Lucretius then considers conception and what in modern terms would be called genetics. Both man and woman, he says, produce genital fluids that mingle in a successful procreative act. The characteristics of the child are formed by the relative proportions of the mother's \\"seed\\" to the father's. A child who most resembles its mother is born when the female seed dominates the male's, and vice versa; when neither the male nor female seed dominates, the child will have traits of both mother and father evenly.The sex of the child, however, is not determined by the gender of the parent whose traits dominate. Infertility occurs when the two partners fail to make a satisfactory match of their seed after several attempts; the explanation for infertility is physiological and rational, and has nothing to do with the gods.Lucretius, De rerum natura 4.1209‚Äì1277 The transfer of genital \\"seed\\" (semina) is consonant with Epicurean physics and the theme of the work as a whole: the invisible semina rerum, \\"seeds of things,\\" continually dissolve and recombine in universal flux.Brown, p. 69. The vocabulary of biological procreation underlies Lucretius's presentation of how matter is formed from atoms.David Sedley, Lucretius and the Transformation of Greek Wisdom (Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 195‚Äì196. Lucretius' purpose is to correct ignorance and to give the knowledge necessary for managing one's sex life rationally.Brown, p. 68. He distinguishes between pleasure and conception as goals of copulation; both are legitimate, but require different approaches. He recommends casual sex as a way of releasing sexual tension without becoming obsessed with a single object of desire;Lucretius, De rerum natura 4.1144ff.Brown, p. 193. a \\"streetwalking Venus\\"‚Äîa common prostitute‚Äîshould be used as a surrogate.Phebe Lowell Bowditch, Horace and the Gifty Economy of Patronage (University of California Press, 2001), p. 215. Sex without passionate attachment produces a superior form of pleasure free of uncertainty, frenzy, and mental disturbance.Lucretius, De rerum natura 4.1076ff.Brown, p. 217. Lucretius calls this form of sexual pleasure venus, in contrast to amor, passionate love.Lucretius, De rerum natura 4.1058, 1073, 1084Brown, p. 227. The best sex is that of happy animals, or of gods.Fredrick, p. 105. The \\"true\\" gods as conceived by Epicureans bear little resemblance to those found in mythological literature; they don't concern themselves with mortals, much less have sexual relations with them, and dwell in a state of detachment and ideal pleasure. Lucretius combines an Epicurean wariness of sex as a threat to peace of mind with the Roman cultural value placed on sexuality as an aspect of marriage and family life,Brown, pp. 69ff. pictured as an Epicurean man in a tranquil and friendly marriage with a good but homely woman, beauty being a disquieting prompt to excessive desire.Lucretius, De rerum natura 4.1278‚Äì1287; Gordon, \\"Some Unseen Monster,\\" p. 105. Lucretius reacts against the Roman tendency to display sex ostentatiously, as in erotic art, and rejects the aggressive, \\"Priapic\\" model of sexuality spurred by visual stimulus.Gordon, \\"Some Unseen Monster,\\" pp. 90‚Äì94. =Stoic sexual morality= In early Stoicism among the Greeks, sex was regarded as a good, if enjoyed between people who maintained the principles of respect and friendship; in the ideal society, sex should be enjoyed freely, without bonds of marriage that treated the partner as property. Some Greek Stoics privileged same-sex relations between a man and a younger male partnerColish, p. 39, pointing out that to the early Stoics, \\"sexual needs may therefore be met in whatever manner pleases the individual, including prostitution, incest, masturbation, and homosexuality.\\" (see \\"Pederasty in ancient Greece\\"). However, stoics in the Roman Imperial era departed from the view of human beings as \\"communally sexual animals\\"Gaca, p. 89. Gaca (p. 60) emphasizes that Seneca and Musonius, while highly influential among the Romans, were \\"unrepresentative\\" of the Stoic tradition in general. and emphasized sex within marriage, which as an institution helped sustain social order.William Loader, Sexuality and the Jesus Tradition (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2005), p. 186. The relation of Stoic sexual ethics to the formation of Christian sexual ethics is a much-discussed topic of scholarship, but mainstream Christianity regarded celibacy as ideal and sex as inherently sinful, redeemed somewhat if occurring within marriage; see Nussbaum, p. 308. See also Colish. Although they distrusted strong passions, including sexual desire,Martha Nussbaum, The Therapy of Desire: Theory and Practice in Hellenistic Ethics (Princeton University Press, 1994, 2009), pp. 359‚Äì401. sexual vitality was necessary for procreation. Roman-era Stoics such as Seneca and Musonius Rufus, both active about 100 years after Lucretius, emphasized \\"sex unity\\" over the polarity of the sexes.Prudence Allen, The Concept of Woman: The Aristotelian Revolution, 750 BC‚ÄìAD 1250 (Eden Press, 1985), p. 159. Although Musonius is predominately a Stoic, his philosophy also partakes of Platonism and Pythagoreanism.Nussbaum, p. 299. Musonius wrote in Greek under Roman rule; Seneca was a Latin author from Roman Spain. He rejected the Aristotelian tradition, which portrayed sexual dimorphism as expressing a proper relation of those ruling (male) and those being ruled (female), and distinguished men from women as biologically lacking. Dimorphism exists, according to Musonius, simply to create difference, and difference in turn creates the desire for a complementary relationship, that is, a couple who will bond for life for the sake of each other and for their children. The Roman ideal of marriage was a partnership of companions who work together to produce and rear children, manage everyday affairs, lead exemplary lives, and enjoy affection; Musonius drew on this ideal to promote the Stoic view that the capacity for virtue and self-mastery was not gender-specific.Nussbaum, p. 300. Marcus Aurelius wrote that sex \\"is the friction of a piece of gut and, following a sort of convulsion, the expulsion of some mucus\\" Both Musonius and Seneca criticized the double standard, cultural and legal, that granted Roman men greater sexual freedom than women.Colish, pp. 37‚Äì38. Men, Musonius argues, are excused by society for resorting to prostitutes and slaves to satisfy their sexual appetites, while such behavior from a woman would not be tolerated; therefore, if men presume to exercise authority over women because they believe themselves to have greater self-control, they ought to be able to manage their sex drive. The argument, then, is not that sexual freedom is a human good, but that men as well as women should exercise sexual restraint.Gretchen Reydams-Schils, The Roman Stoics: Self, Responsibility, and Affection (University of Chicago Press, 2005), p. 151. A man visiting a prostitute does harm to himself by lacking self-discipline; disrespect for his wife and her expectations of fidelity would not be at issue.Nussbaum, pp. 307‚Äì308. Similarly, a man should not be so self-indulgent as to exploit a female slave sexually; however, her right not to be used is not a motive for his restraint.Nussbaum, p. 308. Musonius maintained that even within marriage, sex should be undertaken as an expression of affection and for procreation, and not for \\"bare pleasure\\".\\"Bare pleasure\\" is psil√™n h√™don√™n; Nussbaum, p. 309. Musonius disapproved of same-sex relations because they lacked a procreative purpose.Nussbaum, pp. 299‚Äì300Reydams-Schils, The Roman Stoics, p. 152. Seneca and Epictetus also thought that procreation privileged male‚Äìfemale sexual pairing within marriage,Gaca, p. 87. and Seneca strongly opposed adultery, finding it particularly offensive by women.Gaca, p. 89. Although Seneca is known primarily as a Stoic philosopher, he draws on Neopythagoreanism for his views on sexual austerity.Gaca, p. 111. Neopythagoreans characterized sexuality outside marriage as disordered and undesirable; celibacy was not an ideal, but chastity within marriage was.Allen, The Concept of Woman, pp. 147‚Äì148. To Seneca, sexual desire for pleasure (libido) is a \\"destructive force (exitium) insidiously fixed in the innards\\"; unregulated, it becomes cupiditas, lust. The only justification for sex is reproduction within marriage.Gaca, p. 111, citing Ad Helviam 13.3: \\"If one thinks that sexual lust is given to a man not for the purpose of pleasure but for propagating the human race, then all other lust will pass him by unscathed, since the destructive force insidiously fixed in the innards does not violently harm him\\" (si cogitas libidinem non voluptatis causa homini datam, sed propagandi generis, quem no violaverit hoc secretum et infixum visceribus ipsis exitium, omnis alia cupiditas intactum praeteribit). Although other Stoics see potential in beauty to be an ethical stimulus, a way to attract and develop affection and friendship within sexual relations, Seneca distrusts the love of physical beauty as destroying reason to the point of insanity.Gaca, p. 112, citing Seneca, De matrimonio 188 (edition of Frassinetti, as excerpted by Jerome, Against Jovinianus 319a. A man should have no sexual partner other than his wife, and the wise man (sapiens, Greek sophos) will make love to his wife by exercising good judgment (iudicium), not emotion (affectus).Gaca, p. 112. This is a far stricter view than that of other Stoics who advocate sex as a means of promoting mutual affection within marriage. Venus rising from the sea, a wall painting from Pompeii The philosophical view of the body as a corpse that carries around the soulA view of Epictetus as quoted by Marcus Aurelius, 4.41: \\"You are a little soul carrying a corpse around, as Epictetus used to say.\\" could result in outright contempt for sexuality: the emperor and Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius writes, \\"as for sexual intercourse, it is the friction of a piece of gut and, following a sort of convulsion, the expulsion of some mucus\\".Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 6.13, as translated by Hard and cited by Reydams-Schils, The Roman Stoics, p. 36. Seneca rails \\"at great length\\" against the perversity of one Hostius Quadra, who surrounded himself with the equivalent of funhouse mirrors so he could view sex parties from distorted angles and penises would look bigger.Seneca, Natural Questions 1.16, as discussed by Reydams-Schils, The Roman Stoics, p. 112. Sexual severity opened the Roman Stoics to charges of hypocrisy: Juvenal satirizes those who affect a rough and manly Stoic fa√ßade but privately indulge.Juvenal, Satire 2.8‚Äì10, 15‚Äì17, as cited by Potter (2009), p. 340, with further references to her more in-depth discussions of Juvenal's portrayal in other studies. It was routinely joked that not only were Stoics inclined toward pederasty, they liked young men who were acquiring beards, contrary to Roman sexual custom. Martial repeatedly makes insinuations about those who were outwardly Stoic but privately enjoyed the passive homosexual role.Richlin (1993), p. 542, citing Martial 1.24, 1.96, 2.36, 6.56, 7.58, 9.27, and 12.42. Stoic sexual ethics are grounded in their physics and cosmology.Gaca, pp. 60, 92. The 5th-century writer Macrobius preserves a Stoic interpretation of the myth of the birth of Venus as a result of the primal castration of the deity Heaven (Latin Caelus).\\"... Kronos is the same as Khronos: for as much as the mythographers offer different versions of Saturn [= Kronos] in their tales, the physical scientists restore him to a certain likeness to the truth. They say that he cut off the genitals of his father, Heaven, and that when these were cast into the sea Venus was engendered, taking the name Aphrodite from the foam [Greek aphros] from which she formed. They interpret this to mean that when chaos existed, time did not, since time is a fixed measurement computed from the rotation of the heavens. Hence Kronos, who as I said is Khronos, is thought to have been born from heaven itself. Because the seeds for engendering all things (semina rerum omnium) after heaven flowed down from heaven, and because all the elements that fill the world took their start from those seeds, when the world was complete in all its parts and members, the process of bringing forth seeds from heaven for the creation of the elements came to an end at a fixed moment in time, since a full complement of elements had by then been created. The capacity for engendering living things in an unbroken sequence of reproduction was transferred from water to Venus, so that all things would thenceforth come into being through the intercourse of male and female\\": Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.8.6‚Äì8, Loeb Classical Library translation by Robert A. Kaster. The myth, Macrobius indicates, could be understood as an allegory of the doctrine of seminal reason. The elements derive from the semina, \\"seeds,\\" that are generated by heaven; \\"love\\" brings together the elements in the act of creation, like the sexual union of male and female.Colish, p. 320. Cicero suggests that in Stoic allegory the severing of reproductive organs signifies, \\"...that the highest heavenly aether, that seed-fire which generates all things, did not require the equivalent of human genitals to proceed in its generative work\\".Cicero, On the Nature of the Gods 2.64. Isidore of Seville says similarly that Saturn \\"cut off the genitalia of his father Caelus, because nothing is born in the heavens from seeds\\" (Etymologies 9.11.32). Jane Chance, Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433‚Äì1177 (University Press of Florida, 1994), pp. 27 and 142. Male sexuality Male‚Äìfemale couple on an oil lamp (R√∂misch-Germanisches Museum) During the Republic, a Roman citizen's political liberty (libertas) was defined in part by the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion, including both corporal punishment and sexual abuse.McGinn (1998), p. 326. See the statement preserved by Aulus Gellius 9.12. 1 that \\" it was an injustice to bring force to bear against the body of those who are free\\" (vim in corpus liberum non aecum ... adferri). Virtus, \\"valor\\" as that which made a man most fully a man (vir), was among the active virtues.Elaine Fantham, \\"The Ambiguity of Virtus in Lucan's Civil War and Statius' Thebiad,\\" Arachnion 3 Edwin S. Ramage, ‚ÄúAspects of Propaganda in the De bello gallico: Caesar‚Äôs Virtues and Attributes,‚Äù Athenaeum 91 (2003) 331‚Äì372; Myles Anthony McDonnell, Roman manliness: virtus and the Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2006) passim; Rhiannon Evans, Utopia Antiqua: Readings of the Golden Age and Decline at Rome (Routledge, 2008), pp. 156‚Äì157. Roman ideals of masculinity were thus premised on taking an active role that was also, as Williams has noted, \\"the prime directive of masculine sexual behavior for Romans.\\" The impetus toward action might express itself most intensely in an ideal of dominance that reflects the hierarchy of Roman patriarchal society.Williams, p. 18. The \\"conquest mentality\\" was part of a \\"cult of virility\\" that particularly shaped Roman homosexual practices.Cantarella, p. xi In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, an emphasis on domination has led scholars to view expressions of Roman male sexuality in terms of a \\"penetrator-penetrated\\" binary model; that is, the proper way for a Roman male to seek sexual gratification was to insert his penis in his partner. Allowing himself to be penetrated threatened his liberty as a free citizen as well as his sexual integrity.See further discussion of how sexual activity defines the free, respectable citizen from the slave or \\"un-free\\" person below under Master- slave relations and Pleasure and infamy. It was expected and socially acceptable for a freeborn Roman man to want sex with both female and male partners, as long as he took the dominating role.Richlin (1983), p. 225. Acceptable objects of desire were women of any social or legal status, male prostitutes, or male slaves, but sexual behaviors outside marriage were to be confined to slaves and prostitutes, or less often a concubine or \\"kept woman.\\" Lack of self-control, including in managing one's sex life, indicated that a man was incapable of governing others;Hallett, pp. 67‚Äì68. the enjoyment of \\"low sensual pleasure\\" threatened to erode the elite male's identity as a cultured person.Hallett, p. 68. It was a point of pride for Gaius Gracchus to claim that during his term as a provincial governor he kept no slave-boys chosen for their good looks, no female prostitutes visited his house, and he never accosted other men's slave-boys.Aulus Gellius 15.12.3Williams, pp. 20‚Äì21, 39. In the Imperial era, anxieties about the loss of political liberty and the subordination of the citizen to the emperor were expressed by a perceived increase in passive homosexual behavior among free men, accompanied by a documentable increase in the execution and corporal punishment of citizens.Potter (2009), p. 329. The law began to specify harsher punishments for the lower classes (humiliores) than for the elite (honestiores). The dissolution of Republican ideals of physical integrity in relation to libertas contributes to and is reflected by the sexual license and decadence associated with the Empire.This is a theme throughout Carlin A. Barton, The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster (Princeton University Press, 1993). =Male nudity= Roman Neo-Attic stele depicting a warrior in a muscle cuirass, idealizing the male form without nudity (1st century BC) The poet Ennius (ca. 239‚Äì169 BC) declared that \\"exposing naked bodies among citizens is the beginning of public disgrace (flagitium),\\" a sentiment echoed by Cicero that again links the self-containment of the body with citizenship.Flagiti principium est nudare inter civis corpora: Ennius, as quoted by Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 4.33.70Williams, pp. 64 and 292, note 12Younger, p. 134Simon Goldhill, introduction to Being Greek under Rome: Cultural Identity, the Second Sophistic and the Development of Empire (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 2. Originally, flagitium meant a public shaming, and later more generally a disgrace; Fritz Graf, \\"Satire in a Ritual Context,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Roman Satire (Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp. 195‚Äì197. Roman attitudes toward nudity differed from those of the Greeks, whose ideal of masculine excellence was expressed by the nude male body in art and in such real-life venues as athletic contests. The toga, by contrast, distinguished the body of the sexually privileged adult Roman male.Habinek, p. 39. Even when stripping down for exercises, Roman men kept their genitals and buttocks covered, an Italic custom shared also with the Etruscans, whose art mostly shows them wearing a loincloth, a skirt-like garment, or the earliest form of \\"shorts\\" for athletics. Romans who competed in the Olympic Games presumably followed the Greek custom of nudity, but athletic nudity at Rome has been dated variously, possibly as early as the introduction of Greek-style games in the 2nd century BC but perhaps not regularly till the time of Nero around 60 AD. Public nudity might be offensive or distasteful even in traditional settings; Cicero derides Mark Antony as undignified for appearing near-naked as a participant in the Lupercalia, even though it was ritually required.Julia Heskel, \\"Cicero as Evidence for Attitudes to Dress in the Late Republic,\\" in The World of Roman Costume (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 138 Nudity is one of the themes of this religious festival that most consumes Ovid's attention in the Fasti, his long-form poem on the Roman calendar.Ovid, Fasti 2.283‚Äì380. Augustus, during his program of religious revivalism, attempted to reform the Lupercalia, in part by suppressing the use of nudity despite its fertility aspect.Carole E. Newlands, Playing with Time: Ovid and the Fasti (Cornell University Press, 1995), pp. 59‚Äì60. Negative connotations of nudity include defeat in war, since captives were stripped, and slavery, since slaves for sale were often displayed naked. The disapproval of nudity was thus less a matter of trying to suppress inappropriate sexual desire than of dignifying and marking the citizen's body.Williams, pp. 69‚Äì70. The influence of Greek art, however, led to \\"heroic\\" nude portrayals of Roman men and gods, a practice that began in the 2nd century BC. When statues of Roman generals nude in the manner of Hellenistic kings first began to be displayed, they were shocking not simply because they exposed the male figure, but because they evoked concepts of royalty and divinity that were contrary to Republican ideals of citizenship as embodied by the toga.Paul Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus (University of Michigan Press, 1988), p. 5ff. The god Mars is presented as a mature, bearded man in the attire of a Roman general when he is conceived of as the dignified father of the Roman people, while depictions of Mars as youthful, beardless, and nude show the influence of the Greek Ares. In art produced under Augustus, the programmatic adoption of Hellenistic and Neo-Attic style led to more complex signification of the male body shown nude, partially nude, or costumed in a muscle cuirass.Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus, pp. 239‚Äì240, 249‚Äì250 et passim. One exception to public nudity was the baths, though attitudes toward nude bathing also changed over time. In the 2nd century BC, Cato preferred not to bathe in the presence of his son, and Plutarch implies that for Romans of these earlier times it was considered shameful for mature men to expose their bodies to younger males.Plutarch, Life of Cato 20.5Williams, pp. 69‚Äì70Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus, p. 6. Later, however, men and women might even bathe together.Until the late Republic, a bath house probably offered women a separate wing or facility, or had a schedule that allowed women and men to bathe at different times. From the late Republic until the rise of Christian dominance in the later Empire, there is clear evidence of mixed bathing. Some scholars have thought that only lower-class women bathed with men, or those such as entertainers or prostitutes who were infames, but Clement of Alexandria observed that women of the highest social classes could be seen naked at the baths. Hadrian prohibited mixed bathing, but the ban seems not to have endured. In short, customs varied not only by time and place, but by facility; see Garrett G. Fagan, Bathing in Public in the Roman World (University of Michigan Press, 1999, 2002), pp. 26‚Äì27. =Phallic sexuality= Mercury is sometimes represented triphallically; see for instance Miranda Green, Symbol and Image in Celtic Religious Art (Routledge, 1989), p. 184. In The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster (Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 168, Carlin A. Barton associates polyphallic tintinnabula with the Medusa's head and other grotesques. bronze tintinnabulum; the tip of each phallus was outfitted with a ring to dangle a bell Roman sexuality as framed by Latin literature has been described as phallocentric.Clarke, p. 84David J. Mattingly, Imperialism, Power, and Identity: Experiencing the Roman Empire (Princeton University Press, 2011), p. 106. The phallus was supposed to have powers to ward off the evil eye and other malevolent supernatural forces. It was used as an amulet (fascinum), many examples of which survive, particularly in the form of wind chimes (tintinnabula).Hallett, p. 215. Some scholars have even interpreted the plan of the Forum Augustum as phallic, \\"with its two semi-circular galleries or exedrae as the testicles and its long projecting forecourt as the shaft\\".Plan of the Forum Augustum (in yellow)Dominic Montserrat, \\"Reading Gender in the Roman World,\\" in Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity, and Power in the Roman Empire (Routledge, 2000), pp. 168‚Äì170 (quotation on p. 169), citing also Barbara Kellum, \\"The Phallus as Signifier: The Forum of Augustus and Rituals of Masculinity,\\" in Sexuality in Ancient Art (Cambridge University Press, 1996), pp. 170‚Äì173, and \\"Concealing/Revealing: Gender and the Play of Meaning in the Monuments of Ancient Rome,\\" in Habinek, p. 170. \\"Such readings of major Roman public building projects may seem fanciful, born out of the late twentieth-century fascination which wishes to see everything refracted through its prism,\\" Montserrat notes (p. 170)Fredrick, pp. 248‚Äì249. The idea is that the plan would have a apotropaic function mimicking on a grand scale the local effect of the bulla or fascinum. The outsized phallus of Roman art was associated with the god Priapus, among others. It was laughter-provoking, grotesque, or used for magical purposes.Fredrick, p. 156. Originating in the Greek town of Lampsacus, Priapus was a fertility deity whose statue was placed in gardens to ward off thieves. The poetry collection called the Priapea deals with phallic sexuality, including poems spoken in the person of Priapus. In one, for instance, Priapus threatens anal rape against any potential thief. The wrath of Priapus might cause impotence, or a state of perpetual arousal with no means of release: one curse of Priapus upon a thief was that he might lack women or boys to relieve him of his erection, and burst. There are approximately 120 recorded Latin terms and metaphors for the penis, with the largest category treating the male member as an instrument of aggression, a weapon.Mattingly, Imperialism, Power, and Identity, p. 106. This metaphorical tendency is exemplified by actual lead sling-bullets, which are sometimes inscribed with the image of a phallus, or messages that liken the target to a sexual conquest‚Äîfor instance \\"I seek Octavian's asshole.\\"As represented by the glandes Perusinae; Williams, p. 21. The most common obscenity for the penis is mentula, which Martial argues for in place of polite terms: his privileging of the word as time-honored Latin from the era of Numa may be compared to the unvarnished integrity of \\"four letter Anglo-Saxon words\\".Martial, 11.15.8ff., with 48 usages throughout his epigramsAdams, p. 9. Cicero does not use the word even when discussing the nature of obscene language in a letter to his friend Atticus;Cicero, Ad familiares 9.22 Catullus famously uses it as a pseudonym for the disreputable Mamurra, Julius Caesar's friend (\\"Dick\\" or \\"Peter\\" might be English equivalents).It is the most common word for \\"penis\\" in the poetry of Catullus, appearing eight times; Adams, pp. 10‚Äì11. Mentula appears frequently in graffiti and the Priapea,Eighteen times in inscriptions from Pompeii, thrice in the Graffiti del Palatino, and 26 times in the Priapea; Adams, pp. 10, 12. but while obscene the word was not inherently abusive or vituperative. Verpa, by contrast, was \\"an emotive and highly offensive word\\" for the penis with its foreskin drawn back, as the result of an erection, excessive sexual activity, or circumcision.Adams, p. 13. Verpa appears once each in Catullus (28.12), Martial (11.46.2), and the Priapea (34.5). As a term of vulgar Latin, it appears frequently in graffiti (Adams, pp. 12‚Äì13). Virga, as well as other words for \\"branch, rod, stake, beam\\", is a common metaphor,Adams, pp. 14‚Äì17, 23, 28. as is vomer, \\"plough\\".Adams, p. 24. Priapus, wearing a Phrygian cap and weighing his phallus in a balance scale (House of the Vettii, Pompeii) The penis might also be referred to as the \\"vein\\" (vena), \\"tail\\" (penis or cauda), or \\"tendon\\" (nervus).Adams, pp. 35‚Äì38. The English word \\"penis\\" derives from penis, which originally meant \\"tail\\" but in Classical Latin was used regularly as a \\"risqu√© colloquialism\\" for the male organ. Later, penis becomes the standard word in polite Latin, as used for example by the scholiast to Juvenal and by Arnobius, but did not pass into usage among the Romance languages.Adams, pp. 35‚Äì36. It was not a term used by medical writers, except for Marcellus of Bordeaux.Marcellus, De medicamentis 7.20, 33.2, 33.36Adams, p. 36. In medieval Latin, a vogue for scholarly obscenity led to a perception of the dactyl, a metrical unit of verse represented as an image of the penis, with the long syllable (longum) the shaft and the two short syllables (breves) the testicles.Adams, p. 39. The apparent connection between Latin testes, \\"testicles,\\" and testis, plural testes, \\"witness\\" (the origin of English \\"testify\\" and \\"testimony\\")Adams, p. 67. may lie in archaic ritual. Some ancient Mediterranean cultures swore binding oaths upon the male genitalia, symbolizing that \\"the bearing of false witness brings a curse upon not only oneself, but one's house and future line\\".Joshua T. Katz, \\"Testimonia Ritus Italicus: Male Genitalia, Solemn Declarations, and a New Latin Sound Law,\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 98 (1998) 183‚Äì217 (quotation from p. 193), pointing to the oaths in the Book of Genesis, chapters 24 and 47; the testicles of ritually slaughtered animals used to affirm testimony in Athenian murder trials, as at Demosthenes, Contra Aristocratem 23.67f.; Rhetorica ad Herennium 3.33, where ram's testicles are a mnemonic device in a courtroom exercise. Katz proposes that the Umbrian hapax urfeta means \\"testicles\\" and is related to Latin orbis (as \\"balls\\"); thus the Iguvine Tables also make a connection between testicles and \\"solemn declarations\\" (Katz, p. 191). Latin writers make frequent puns and jokes based on the two meanings of testis:Katz, \\"Testimonia Ritus Italicus,\\" p. 189. it took balls to become a legally functioning male citizen.Richlin (1993), pp. 546‚Äì547. The English word \\"testicle\\" derives from the diminutive testiculum. The obscene word for \\"testicle\\" was coleus.Adams, p. 66. Castration and circumcision To Romans and Greeks, castration and circumcision were linked as barbaric mutilations of the male genitalia.Juvenal 14.103‚Äì104; Tacitus, Historia 5.5.1‚Äì2; Martial 7.30.5, 7.35.3‚Äì4, 7.82.5‚Äì6, 11.94; Margaret Williams, \\"Jews and Jewish Communities in the Roman Empire,\\" in Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire (Routledge, 2000), p. 325Smallwood, p. 431Jack N. Lightstone, \\"Roman Diaspora Judaism,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 362. When the cult of Cybele was imported to Rome at the end of the 3rd century BC, its traditional eunuchism was confined to foreign priests (the Galli), while Roman citizens formed sodalities to perform honors in keeping with their own customs.Eric Orlin, \\"Urban Religion in the Middle and Late Republic\\", pp. 63‚Äì64, and John Scheid, \\"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors\\", p. 268, in A Companion to Roman Religion. It has been argued that among the reasons for the Apostle Paul's exhortation of the Galatians not to undergo circumcision,; the practice at the time should be understood not only in the context of Jewish circumcision, but also of the ritual castration associated with Cybele, whose cult was centered in Galatia.Paul of Tarsus, Galatians 4:21‚Äì5:1\\"The Rhetorical Situation Revisited: Circumcision and Castration,\\" in Cutting Too Close for Comfort: Paul‚Äôs Letter to the Galatians in Its Anatolian Cultic Context (T&T; Clark International, 2003) passim. Among Jews, circumcision was a marker of the Abrahamic covenant; diaspora Jews circumcised their male slaves and adult male converts, in addition to Jewish male infants.Lightstone, \\"Roman Diaspora Judaism,\\" p. 363. Although Greco-Roman writers view circumcision as an identifying characteristic of Jews, they believed the practice to have originated in Egypt,Several Greco-Roman writers, such as Strabo, regarded the Jews as of Egyptian descent, in what was apparently their understanding of the Exodus. Schafer (1997), pp. 93‚Äì94. and recorded it among peoples they identified as Arab, Syrian, Phoenician, Colchian, and Ethiopian.Smallwood, p. 430Schafer (1997), pp. 93‚Äì94. The Neoplatonic philosopher Sallustius associates circumcision with the strange familial‚Äìsexual customs of the Massagetae who \\"eat their fathers\\" and of the Persians who \\"preserve their nobility by begetting children on their mothers\\".Schafer (1997), p. 99. During the Republican period, a Lex Cornelia prohibited various kinds of mutilation, including castration. (Two millennia later, in 1640, the poet Salvatore Rosa would write in La Musica, ‚ÄúFine Cornelia law, where hast thou gone / Now that the whole of Norcia seems not enough / For the castration of boys?‚Äù) Despite these prohibitions, some Romans kept beautiful male slaves as deliciae or delicati (\\"toys, delights\\") who were sometimes castrated in an effort to preserve the androgynous looks of their youth. The emperor Nero had his freedman Sporus castrated, and married him in a public ceremony.Williams, pp. 251‚Äì252, citing Suetonius, Life of Nero. By the end of the 1st century AD, bans against castration had been enacted by the emperors Domitian and Nerva in the face of a burgeoning trade in eunuch slaves. Sometime between 128 and 132 AD, Hadrian seems to have temporarily banned circumcision, on pain of death.Sch√§fer (2003), p. 150, Schafer (1997), p. 103, pointing out this depends on a single note in the Historia Augusta, the historical credibility of which is often cast in doubt. Cassius Dio mentions nothing about circumcision in his account of the Bar Kokhba revolt. See also Smallwood, pp. 430‚Äì431, who thinks the ban makes more sense as a punitive measure after the revolt, since it \\"ran completely counter to the long established Roman policy of guaranteeing Jewish religious liberty.\\" Antoninus Pius exempted Jews from the ban,Sch√§fer (2003), p. 150Smallwood, p. 467. as well as Egyptian priests,Smallwood, p. 470. and Origen says that in his time only Jews were permitted to practice circumcision.Schafer (1997), p. 103Smallwood, p. 469, takes Origen as meaning that circumcision was \\"a solely Jewish rite\\" by his time. Legislation under Constantine, the first Christian emperor, freed any slave who was subjected to circumcision; in 339 AD, circumcising a slave became punishable by death.Sch√§fer (2003), p. 185. A medical procedure known as epispasm, which consisted of both surgical and non-surgical methods, existed in ancient Rome and Greece to restore the foreskin and cover the glans \\"for the sake of decorum\\".Causa decoris: Celsus, De Medicina, 7.25.1A. Both were described in detail by the Greek physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus in his comprehensive encyclopedic work De Medicina, written during the reign of Tiberius (14-37 CE). The surgical method involved freeing the skin covering the penis by dissection, and then pulling it forward over the glans; he also described a simpler surgical technique used on men whose prepuce is naturally insufficient to cover their glans. The second approach was non-surgical: a restoration device which consisted of a special weight made of bronze, copper, or leather, was affixed to the penis, pulling its skin downward. Overtime a new foreskin was generated, or a short prepuce was lengthened, by means of tissue expansion; Martial also mentioned the restoration device in Epigrammaton (Book 7:35). Hellenized or Romanized Jews resorted to epispasm to better integrate into the Greco-Roman society, and also to make themselves less conspicuous at the baths or during athletics. Of these, some had themselves circumcised again later.Sch√§fer (2003), p. 151. =Regulating semen= Too-frequent ejaculation was thought to weaken men. Greek medical theories based on the classical elements and humors recommended limiting the production of semen by means of cooling, drying, and astringent therapies, including cold baths and the avoidance of flatulence-causing foods.Dugan, pp. 403‚Äì404. In the 2nd century AD, the medical writer Galen explains semen as a concoction of blood (conceived of as a humor) and pneuma (the \\"vital air\\" required by organs to function) formed within the man's coiled spermatic vessels, with the humor turning white through heat as it enters into the testicles.Dugan, pp. 404‚Äì405. Galen's theory is based on that of Aristotle. In his treatise On Semen, Galen warns that immoderate sexual activity results in a loss of pneuma and hence vitality: > It is not at all surprising that those who are less moderate sexually turn > out to be weaker, since the whole body loses the purest part of both > substances, and there is besides an accession of pleasure, which by itself > is enough to dissolve the vital tone, so that before now some persons have > died from excess of pleasure.Galen, De semine 1.16.30‚Äì32 (4.588 K√ºhn = De > Lacy 1992, 138‚Äì41). The uncontrolled dispersing of pneuma in semen could lead to loss of physical vigor, mental acuity, masculinity, and a strong manly voice,Dugan, p. 406. a complaint registered also in the Priapea.Ann Ellis Hanson, \\"The Restructuring of Female Physiology at Rome,\\" in Les √©coles m√©dicales √† Rome (Universit√© de Nantes, 1991), p. 267, citing Priapea 78 and CIL 12.6721(5), one of the Perusine glandes. Sexual activity was thought particularly to affect the voice: singers and actors might be infibulated to preserve their voices.Martial 6.82, Juvenal 6.73, 379; J.P. Sullivan, Martial, the Unexpected Classic (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 189Schafer (1997), p. 101Peter J. Ucko, \\"Penis Sheaths: A Comparative Study,\\" in Material Culture: Critical Concepts in the Social Sciences (Routledge, 2004), p. 260. Quintilian advises that the orator who wished to cultivate a deep masculine voice for court should abstain from sexual relations.Quintilian, Institutio Oratoria 11.3.19. This concern was felt intensely by Catullus's friend Calvus, the 1st-century BC avant-garde poet and orator, who slept with lead plates over his kidneys to control wet dreams. Pliny reports that: > When plates of lead are bound to the area of the loins and kidneys, it is > used, owing to its rather cooling nature, to check the attacks of sexual > desire and sexual dreams in one's sleep that cause spontaneous eruptions to > the point of becoming a sort of disease. With these plates the orator Calvus > is reported to have restrained himself and to have preserved his body's > strength for the labor of his studies.Pliny, Natural History 34.166. Lead plates, cupping therapy, and hair removal were prescribed for three sexual disorders thought to be related to nocturnal emissions: satyriasis, or hypersexuality; priapism, a chronic erection without an accompanying desire for sex; and the involuntary discharge of semen (seminis lapsus or seminis effusio).The Greek word for the involuntary discharge of semen was gonorrhea. Dugan, pp. 403‚Äì404. =Effeminacy and transvestism= Hercules and Omphale cross-dressed (mosaic from Roman Spain, 3rd century AD) Effeminacy was a favorite accusation in Roman political invective, and was aimed particularly at populares, the politicians of the faction who represented themselves as champions of the people, sometimes called Rome's \\"democratic\\" party in contrast to the optimates, a conservative elite of nobles.Edwards, pp. 63‚Äì64. In the last years of the Republic, the popularists Julius Caesar, Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony), and Clodius Pulcher, as well as the Catilinarian conspirators, were all derided as effeminate, overly-groomed, too-good-looking men who might be on the receiving end of sex from other males; at the same time, they were supposed to be womanizers or possessed of devastating sex appeal.Edwards, p. 47. Perhaps the most notorious incident of cross-dressing in ancient Rome occurred in 62 BC, when Clodius Pulcher intruded on annual rites of the Bona Dea that were restricted to women only. The rites were held at a senior magistrate's home, in this year that of Julius Caesar, nearing the end of his term as praetor and only recently invested as Pontifex Maximus. Clodius disguised himself as a female musician to gain entrance, as described in a \\"verbal striptease\\" by Cicero, who prosecuted him for sacrilege (incestum):The case, which nearly shipwrecked Clodius's political career, is discussed at length by his biographer, W. Jeffrey Tatum, The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), p. 62ff. > Take away his saffron dress, his tiara, his girly shoes and purple laces, > his bra, his Greek harp, take away his shameless behavior and his sex crime, > and Clodius is suddenly revealed as a democrat.P. Clodius, a crocota, a > mitra, a muliebribus soleis purpureisque fasceolis, a strophio, a psalterio, > flagitio, a stupro est factus repente popularis: Cicero, the speech De > Haruspicium Responso 21.44, delivered May 56 BC, and given a Lacanian > analysis by Eleanor Winsor Leach, ‚ÄúGendering Clodius,‚Äù Classical World 94 > (2001) 335‚Äì359. The actions of Clodius, who had just been elected quaestor and was probably about to turn thirty, are often regarded as a last juvenile prank. The all- female nature of these nocturnal rites attracted much prurient speculation from men; they were fantasized as drunken lesbian orgies that might be fun to watch.Williams Clodius is supposed to have intended to seduce Caesar's wife, but his masculine voice gave him away before he got a chance. The scandal prompted Caesar to seek an immediate divorce to control the damage to his own reputation, giving rise to the famous line \\"Caesar's wife must be above suspicion\\". The incident \\"summed up the disorder of the final years of the republic\\".Edwards, p. 34W. Jeffrey Tatum, Always I Am Caesar (Blackwell, 2008), p. 109. In addition to political invective, cross-dressing appears in Roman literature and art as a mythological trope (as in the story of Hercules and Omphale exchanging roles and attire),Ovid adduces the story of Hercules and Omphale as an explanation for the ritual nudity of the Lupercalia; see under \\"Male nudity\\" above and Richard J. King, Desiring Rome: Male Subjectivity and Reading Ovid's Fasti (Ohio State University Press, 2006), pp. 185, 195, 200, 204. religious investiture, and rarely or ambiguously as transvestic fetishism. A section of the Digest by UlpianDigest 34.2.23.2, as cited in Richlin (1993), p. 540. categorizes Roman clothing on the basis of who may appropriately wear it; a man who wore women's clothes, Ulpian notes, would risk making himself the object of scorn. A fragment from the playwright Accius (170‚Äì86 BC) seems to refer to a father who secretly wore \\"virgin's finery\\".Cum virginali mundo clam pater: Olson, \\"The Appearance of the Young Roman Girl,\\" p. 147. An instance of transvestism is noted in a legal case, in which \\"a certain senator accustomed to wear women's evening clothes\\" was disposing of the garments in his will.Digest 34.2.33, as cited in Richlin (1993), p. 540. In a \\"mock trial\\" exercise presented by the elder Seneca, a young man (adulescens) is gang-raped while wearing women's clothes in public, but his attire is explained as his acting on a dare by his friends, not as a choice based on gender identity or the pursuit of erotic pleasure.Seneca the Elder, Controversia 5.6Richlin (1993), p. 564. Gender ambiguity was a characteristic of the priests of the goddess Cybele known as Galli, whose ritual attire included items of women's clothing. They are sometimes considered a transgender priesthood, since they were required to be castrated in imitation of Attis. The complexities of gender identity in the religion of Cybele and the Attis myth are explored by Catullus in one of his longest poems, Carmen 63.Stephen O. Murray, Homosexualities (University of Chicago Press, 2000), pp. 298‚Äì303; Mary R. Bachvarova, \\"Sumerian Gala Priests and Eastern Mediterranean Returning Gods: Tragic Lamentation in Cross-Cultural Perspective,\\" in Lament: Studies in the Ancient Mediterranean and Beyond (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 19, 33, 36. See also \\"Hermaphroditism and androgyny\\" below. =Male‚Äìmale sex= Roman men were free to have sex with males of lower status without a perceived loss of masculinity, or even as an enhancement of it. However, those who took the receiving role in sex acts, sometimes referred to as the \\"passive\\" or \\"submissive\\" role, were disparaged as weak and effeminate, regardless of the sex of their partner (see the section below on cunnilungus and fellatio), while having sex with males in the active position was proof of one's masculinity. Mastery of one's own body was an aspect of the citizen's libertas, political liberty,For an explanation of this principle in a military setting, see Phang (2008), p. 93. while the use of one's body to give pleasure to others, whether in homosexual or heterosexual relations, was servile. Laws such as the poorly understood Lex Scantinia and various pieces of Augustan moral legislation were meant to restrict same-sex activity among freeborn males, viewed as threatening a man's status and independence as a citizen. Latin had such a wealth of words for men outside the masculine norm that some scholarsRichlin (1993) argue for the existence of a homosexual subculture at Rome; that is, although the noun \\"homosexual\\" has no straightforward equivalent in Latin, literary sources reveal a pattern of behaviors among a minority of free men that indicate same- sex preference or orientation. Some terms, such as exoletus, specifically refer to an adult; Romans who were socially marked as \\"masculine\\" did not confine their same-sex penetration of male prostitutes or slaves to those who were \\"boys\\" under the age of 20.Williams, p. 85. The Satyricon, for example, includes many descriptions of adult, free men showing sexual interest in one another. And some older men may have at times preferred the passive role with a same age or younger partner, though this was socially frowned upon. Homoerotic Latin literature includes the \\"Juventius\\" poems of Catullus,Catullus, Carmina 24, 48, 81, 99. elegies by TibullusTibullus, Book One, elegies 4, 8, and 9. and Propertius,Propertius 4.2. the second Eclogue of Vergil, and several poems by Horace. Lucretius addresses the love of boys in De rerum natura (4.1052‚Äì1056). The poet Martial, despite being married to a woman, often derides women as sexual partners, and celebrates the charms of pueri (boys).Amy Richlin, \\"Sexuality in the Roman Empire,\\" in A Companion to the Roman Empire (Blackwell, 2006), p. 335: \\"The sulks and pride of these boys and their petulant quarrels . . . I prefer to a dowry of a million sesterces.\\" The Satyricon of Petronius is so permeated with the culture of male‚Äìmale sexuality that in 18th-century European literary circles, his name became \\"a byword for homosexuality\\".Louis Crompton, Byron and Greek Love (London, 1998), p. 93. Although Ovid includes mythological treatments of homoeroticism in the Metamorphoses,As at Metamorphoses 10.155ff. he is unusual among Latin love poets, and indeed among Romans in general, for his aggressively heterosexual stance, though even he did not claim exclusive heterosexuality.Hallett. p. 55. Although Roman law did not recognize marriage between men, in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating traditional marriage rites. Same-sex weddings are reported by sources that mock them; the feelings of the participants are not recorded.Both Juvenal (for instance, in Satire 2) and Martial describe weddings between men. Suetonius reports that the emperor Nero had two marriages to men, once taking the role of the bride, and once the groom. Williams, p. 28Karen K. Hersh, The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 36; Caroline Vout, Power and Eroticism in Imperial Rome (Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 151ff. Apart from measures to protect the liberty of citizens, the prosecution of homosexuality as a general crime began in the 3rd century when male prostitution was banned by Philip the Arab, a sympathizer of the Christian faith. By the end of the 4th century, passive homosexuality under the Christian Empire was punishable by burning.Michael Groneberg, \\"Reasons for Homophobia: Three Types of Explanation,\\" in Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 193. \\"Death by sword\\" was the punishment for a \\"man coupling like a woman\\" under the Theodosian Code.Codex Theodosianus 9.7.3 (4 December 342), introduced by the sons of Constantine in 342. Under Justinian, all same-sex acts, passive or active, no matter who the partners, were declared contrary to nature and punishable by death.Groneberg, \\"Reasons for Homophobia,\\" p. 193. Homosexual behaviors were pointed to as causes for God's wrath following a series of disasters around 542 and 559.Michael Brinkschr√∂de, \\"Christian Homophobia: Four Central Discourses,\\" in Combatting Homophobia, p. 166. Justinian also demanded the penalty of death for anyone who enslaved a castrated Roman, although he permitted the buying and selling of foreign-born eunuchs as long as they were castrated outside the boundaries of the Roman Empire (Codex Justinianus, 4.42.2). =The rape of men= Men who had been raped were exempt from the loss of legal or social standing (infamia) suffered by males who prostituted themselves or willingly took the receiving role in sex.Richlin (1993), pp. 558‚Äì559. According to the jurist Pomponius, \\"whatever man has been raped by the force of robbers or the enemy in wartime (vi praedonum vel hostium)\\" ought to bear no stigma.Digest 3.1.1.6, as noted in Richlin (1993), p. 559. Fears of mass rape following a military defeat extended equally to male and female potential victims.Williams, pp. 104‚Äì105. The mythological abduction or \\"rape\\" of Hylas by the nymphs (opus sectile, basilica of Junius Bassus, 4th century AD) Roman law addressed the rape of a male citizen as early as the 2nd century BC, when a ruling was issued in a case that may have involved a male of same- sex orientation. Although a man who had worked as a prostitute could not be raped as a matter of law, it was ruled that even a man who was \\"disreputable (famosus) and questionable (suspiciosus)\\" had the same right as other free men not to have his body subjected to forced sex.As recorded in a fragment of the speech De Re Floria by Cato the Elder (frg. 57 Jordan = Aulus Gellius 9.12.7), as noted and discussed in Richlin (1993), p. 561. In a book on rhetoric from the early 1st century BC, the rape of a freeborn male (ingenuus) is equated with that of a materfamilias as a capital crime.Rhetorica ad Herennium 4.8.12Richlin (1993), p. 562. The Lex Julia de vi publica,Digest 48.6.3.4 and 48.6.5.2. recorded in the early 3rd century AD but \\"probably dating from the dictatorship of Julius Caesar\\", defined rape as forced sex against \\"boy, woman, or anyone\\"; the rapist was subject to execution, a rare penalty in Roman law.Richlin (1993), pp. 562‚Äì563. See also Digest 48.5.35 [34] on legal definitions of rape that included boys. It was a capital crime for a man to abduct a free-born boy for sexual purposes, or to bribe the boy's chaperon (comes) for the opportunity.Paulus, Digest 47.11.1.2 Negligent chaperones could be prosecuted under various laws, placing the blame on those who failed in their responsibilities as guardians rather than on the victim.Richlin (1993), p. 563. Although the law recognized the victim's blamelessness, rhetoric used by the defense indicates that attitudes of blame among jurors could be exploited. In his collection of twelve anecdotes dealing with assaults on chastity, the historian Valerius Maximus features male victims in equal number to female.Valerius Maximus 6.1 In the \\"mock trial\\" case described by the elder Seneca, an adulescens (a man young enough not to have begun his formal career) was gang-raped by ten of his peers; although the case is imaginary, Seneca assumes that the law permitted the successful prosecution of the rapists. Another hypothetical case imagines the extremity to which a rape victim could be driven: the free-born male who was raped commits suicide.Quintilian, Institutio oratoria 4.2.69‚Äì71Richlin (1993), p. 565. The rape of an ingenuus is among the worst crimes that could be committed in Rome, along with parricide, the rape of a female virgin, and robbing a temple.Richlin (1993), p. 565, citing the same passage by Quintilian. Rape was nevertheless one of the traditional punishments inflicted on a male adulterer by the wronged husband,Williams, pp. 27, 76 (with an example from Martial 2.60.2. though perhaps more in revenge fantasy than in practice.Edwards, pp. 55‚Äì56. The threat of one man to subject another to anal or oral rape (irrumatio) is a theme of invective poetry, most notably in Catullus's notorious Carmen 16,Richlin (1983), pp. 27‚Äì28, 43 (on Martial), 58. and was a form of masculine braggadocio.Williams, p. 20Hallett, p. 12 =Sex in the military= The Roman soldier, like any free and respectable Roman male of status, was expected to show self-discipline in matters of sex. Soldiers convicted of adultery were given a dishonorable discharge; convicted adulterers were barred from enlisting. Strict commanders might ban prostitutes and pimps from camp,McGinn (1998), p. 40. though in general the Roman army, whether on the march or at a permanent fort (castrum), was attended by a number of camp followers who might include prostitutes. Their presence seems to have been taken for granted, and mentioned mainly when it became a problem; for instance, when Scipio Aemilianus was setting out for Numantia in 133 BC, he dismissed the camp followers as one of his measures for restoring discipline.David Potter, \\"The Roman Army and Navy,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic, p. 79. Perhaps most peculiar is the prohibition against marriage in the Imperial army. In the early period, Rome had an army of citizens who left their families and took up arms as the need arose. During the expansionism of the Middle Republic, Rome began acquiring vast territories to be defended as provinces, and during the time of Gaius Marius (d. 86 BC), the army had been professionalized. The ban on marriage began under Augustus (ruled 27 BC‚Äì14 AD), perhaps to discourage families from following the army and impairing its mobility. The marriage ban applied to all ranks up to the centurionate; men of the governing classes were exempt. By the 2nd century AD, the stability of the Empire kept most units in permanent forts, where attachments with local women often developed. Although legally these unions could not be formalized as marriages, their value in providing emotional support for the soldiers was recognized. After a soldier was discharged, the couple were granted the right of legal marriage as citizens (conubium), and any children they already had were considered to have been born to citizens.Pat Southern, The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 144. Septimius Severus rescinded the ban in 197 AD.Phang (2001), p. 2. Other forms of sexual gratification available to soldiers were the use of male slaves, war rape, and same-sex relations.Phang (2001), p. 3. The Bellum Hispaniense, about Caesar's civil war on the front in Roman Spain, mentions an officer who has a male concubine (concubinus) on campaign. Homosexual behavior among soldiers was subject to harsh penalties, including death, as a violation of military discipline. Polybius (2nd century BC) reports that same-sex activity in the military was punishable by the fustuarium, clubbing to death.Polybius, Histories 6.37.9 (translated as bastinado). Sex among fellow soldiers violated the Roman decorum against intercourse with another freeborn male. A soldier maintained his masculinity by not allowing his body to be used for sexual purposes. This physical integrity stood in contrast to the limits placed on his actions as a free man within the military hierarchy; most strikingly, Roman soldiers were the only citizens regularly subjected to corporal punishment, reserved in the civilian world mainly for slaves. Sexual integrity helped distinguish the status of the soldier, who otherwise sacrificed a great deal of his civilian autonomy, from that of the slave.Phang (2008), p. 93. See also \\"Master-slave relations\\" below. In warfare, rape signified defeat, another motive for the soldier not to compromise his body sexually.Phang (2008), p. 94. Roman law recognized that a soldier was vulnerable to rape by the enemy: Digest 3.1.1.6, as discussed in Richlin (1993), p. 559. Reverse side of a denarius issued by Julius Caesar, depicting a military trophy with a nude captured Gaul and a female personification of defeated Gallia; Venus is pictured on the obverse An incident related by Plutarch in his biography of Marius illustrates the soldier's right to maintain his sexual integrity. A good-looking young recruit named TreboniusThe name is given elsewhere as Plotius. had been sexually harassed over a period of time by his superior officer, who happened to be Marius's nephew, Gaius Luscius. One night, having fended off unwanted advances on numerous occasions, Trebonius was summoned to Luscius's tent. Unable to disobey the command of his superior, he found himself the object of a sexual assault and drew his sword, killing Luscius. A conviction for killing an officer typically resulted in execution. When brought to trial, he was able to produce witnesses to show that he had repeatedly had to fend off Luscius, and \\"had never prostituted his body to anyone, despite offers of expensive gifts\\". Marius not only acquitted Trebonius in the killing of his kinsman, but gave him a crown for bravery.Plutarch, Life of Marius 14.4‚Äì8; see also Valerius Maximus 6.1.12 and Cicero, Pro Milone 9, in Dillon and Garland, Ancient Rome, p. 380Phang (2008), pp. 93‚Äì94Phang (2001), p. 281Cantarella, pp. 105‚Äì106. Roman historians record other cautionary tales of officers who abuse their authority to coerce sex from their soldiers, and then suffer dire consequences.Phang (2001), pp. 280‚Äì282. The youngest officers, who still might retain some of the adolescent attraction that Romans favored in male‚Äìmale relations, were advised to beef up their masculine qualities, such as not wearing perfume, nor trimming nostril and underarm hair.Phang (2008), p. 97, citing among other examples Juvenal, Satire 14.194‚Äì195. During wartime, the violent use of war captives for sex was not considered criminal rape.Phang (2008), pp. 244, 253‚Äì254. Mass rape was one of the acts of punitive violence during the sack of a city,Phang (2008), pp. 267‚Äì268. but if the siege had ended through diplomatic negotiations rather than storming the walls, by custom the inhabitants were neither enslaved nor subjected to personal violence. Mass rape occurred in some circumstances, and is likely to be underreported in the surviving sources, but was not a deliberate or pervasive strategy for controlling a population.C.R. Whittaker, Rome and Its Frontiers: The Dynamics of Empire (Routledge, 2004), pp. 128‚Äì132. An ethical ideal of sexual self-control among enlisted men was vital to preserving peace once hostilities ceased. In territories and provinces brought under treaty with Rome, soldiers who committed rape against the local people might be subjected to harsher punishments than civilians.Phang (2008), pp. 256, 261. Sertorius, the long-time governor of Roman Spain whose policies emphasized respect and cooperation with provincials, executed an entire cohort when a single soldier had attempted to rape a local woman.Appian, Bellum Civile 1.13.109Phang (2008), pp. 124 and 257. Mass rape seems to have been more common as a punitive measure during Roman civil wars than abroad.Whittaker, Rome and Its Frontiers, pp. 131‚Äì132. Female sexuality Because of the Roman emphasis on family, female sexuality was regarded as one of the bases for social order and prosperity. Female citizens were expected to exercise their sexuality within marriage, and were honored for their sexual integrity (pudicitia) and fecundity: Augustus granted special honors and privileges to women who had given birth to three children (see \\"Ius trium liberorum\\"). Control of female sexuality was regarded as necessary for the stability of the state, as embodied most conspicuously in the absolute virginity of the Vestals.Beth Severy, Augustus and the Family at the Birth of the Roman Empire (Routledge, 2003), p. 39. A Vestal who violated her vow was entombed alive in a ritual that mimicked some aspects of a Roman funeral; her lover was executed.Hans- Friedrich Mueller, Roman Religion in Valerius Maximus (Routledge, 2002), p. 51. Female sexuality, either disorderly or exemplary, often impacts state religion in times of crisis for the Republic.Langlands, p. 57. The moral legislation of Augustus focused on harnessing the sexuality of women. As was the case for men, free women who displayed themselves sexually, such as prostitutes and performers, or who made themselves available indiscriminately were excluded from legal protections and social respectability.See further discussion at Pleasure and infamy below. Many Roman literary sources approve of respectable women exercising sexual passion within marriage.Clarke, p. 103. While ancient literature overwhelmingly takes a male-centered view of sexuality, the Augustan poet Ovid expresses an explicit and virtually unique interest in how women experience intercourse.Roy K. Gibson, Ars Amatoria Book 3 (Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 398‚Äì399. =The female body= Augustan Altar of Peace, combining Roman symbolism with a Greek stylistic influence Roman attitudes toward female nudity differed from but were influenced by those of the Greeks, who idealized the male body in the nude while portraying respectable women clothed. Partial nudity of goddesses in Roman Imperial art, however, can highlight the breasts as dignified but pleasurable images of nurturing, abundance, and peacefulness.Cohen, \\"Divesting the Female Breast,\\" p. 66; Cameron, The Last Pagans, p. 725 Erotic art indicates that women with small breasts and wide hips had the ideal body type.Kelly Olson, \\"The Appearance of the Young Roman Girl,\\" in Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 143Clarke, p. 34. By the 1st century AD, Roman art shows a broad interest in the female nude engaged in varied activities, including sex.Fredrick, p. 160. Pornographic art that depicts women presumed to be prostitutes performing sex acts may show the breasts covered by a strophium even when the rest of the body is naked. In the real world as described in literature, prostitutes sometimes displayed themselves naked at the entrance to their brothel cubicles, or wore see-through silk garments; slaves for sale were often displayed naked to allow buyers to inspect them for defects, and to symbolize that they lacked the right to control their own body.Alastair J. L. Blanshard, Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), p. 24Harper, pp. 293‚Äì294. As Seneca the Elder described a woman for sale: > Naked she stood on the shore, at the pleasure of the purchaser; every part > of her body was examined and felt. Would you hear the result of the sale? > The pirate sold; the pimp bought, that he might employ her as a > prostitute.Seneca, Controversia 1.2. The display of the female body made it vulnerable. Varro said sight was the greatest of the senses, because while the others were limited by proximity, sight could penetrate even to the stars; he thought the Latin word for \\"sight, gaze\\", visus, was etymologically related to vis, \\"force, power\\". But the connection between visus and vis, he said, also implied the potential for violation, just as Actaeon gazing on the naked Diana violated the goddess.Varro, De lingua latina 6.8, citing a fragment from the Latin tragedian Accius on Actaeon that plays with the verb video, videre, visum, \\"see,\\" and its presumed connection to vis (ablative vi, \\"by force\\") and violare, \\"to violate\\": \\"He who saw what should not be seen violated that with his eyes\\" (Cum illud oculis violavit is, qui invidit invidendum)Fredrick, pp. 1‚Äì2. Ancient etymology was not a matter of scientific linguistics, but of associative interpretation based on similarity of sound and implications of theology and philosophy; see Davide Del Bello, Forgotten Paths: Etymology and the Allegorical Mindset (Catholic University of America Press, 2007). The completely nude female body as portrayed in sculpture was thought to embody a universal concept of Venus, whose counterpart Aphrodite is the goddess most often depicted as a nude in Greek art.Clement of Alexandria, Protrepticus 4.50Fredrick, p. 275. Female genitalia formed from strigils on a mosaic Female genitals The \\"basic obscenity\\" for the female genitalia is cunnus, \\"cunt\\", though perhaps not as strongly offensive as the English.Adams, pp. 80‚Äì81. Martial uses the word more than thirty times, Catullus once, and Horace thrice only in his early work; it also appears in the Priapea and graffiti.Adams, p. 81. One of the slang words women used for their genitals was porcus, \\"pig\\", particularly when mature women spoke of girls. Varro connects this usage of the word to the sacrifice of a pig to the goddess Ceres in preliminary wedding rites.Varro, On Agriculture 2.4.9; Karen K. Hersch, The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 122, 276; Barbette Stanley Spaeth, The Roman Goddess Ceres (University of Texas Press, 1996), p. 17. Metaphors of fields, gardens, and meadows are common, as is the image of the masculine \\"plough\\" in the feminine \\"furrow\\".Adams, pp. 82‚Äì83. Other metaphors include cave, ditch, pit, bag, vessel, door, hearth, oven, and altar.Adams, pp. 85‚Äì89. Although women's genitals appear often in invective and satiric verse as objects of disgust, they are rarely referred to in Latin love elegy.Richlin (1983), pp. xvi, 26, 68‚Äì69, 109, 276 et passim. Ovid, the most heterosexual of the classic love poets, is the only one to refer to giving a woman pleasure through genital stimulation.Throughout the Ars Amatoria (\\"Art of Love\\"); Gibson, Ars Amatoria Book 3, p. 399. Martial writes of female genitalia only insultingly, describing one woman's vagina as \\"loose ... as the foul gullet of a pelican\\".Martial, Epigrams 11.21.1, 10: tam laxa ... quam turpe guttur onocrotaliRichlin (1983), p. 27. The vagina is often compared to a boy's anus as a receptacle for the phallus.Richlin (1983), pp. 49, 67Clarke, pp. 21, 48, 116. The function of the clitoris (landica) was \\"well understood\\".Adams, p. 97. In classical Latin, landica was a highly indecorous obscenity found in graffiti and the Priapea; the clitoris was usually referred to with a metaphor, such as Juvenal's crista (\\"crest\\").Juvenal 6.422Adams, p. 98. Cicero records that a hapless speaker of consular rank broke up the senate just by saying something that sounded like landica: hanc culpam maiorem an il-lam dicam? (\\"Shall I call this fault greater or that one?\\" heard as \\"this greater fault or a clitoris?\\"). \\"Could he have been more obscene?\\" Cicero exclaims, observing at the same time that cum nos, \\"when we\\", sounds like cunnus.Cicero, Ad familiares 9.22.2Adams, p. 97Richard W. Hooper, The Priapus Poems: Erotic Epigrams from Ancient Rome (University of Illinois Press, 1999), p. 136. A lead sling-bullet uncovered through archaeology was inscribed \\"I aim for Fulvia's clit\\" (Fulviae landicam peto), Fulvia being the wife of Mark Antony who commanded troops during the civil wars of the 40s and 30s.Hooper, The Priapus Poems, pp. 135‚Äì136. See also \\"Phallic sexuality\\" above for more on sling bullets inscribed with obscenities. Latin lacked a standard word for labia;Adams, p. 99. two terms found in medical writers are orae, \\"edges\\" or \\"shores\\",Celsus 2.7.15, 7.26.1C, 7.26.4, 7.28.1. and pinnacula, \\"little wings\\". The first recorded instance of the word vulva occurs in Varro's work on agriculture (1st century BC), where it refers to the membrane that surrounds a fetus.Varro, On Agriculture 2.1.19Adams, p. 101. In the early Empire, vulva came into usage for \\"womb\\", the usual word for which had been uterus in the Republic, or sometimes more vaguely venter or alvus, both words for \\"belly\\". Vulva seems originally to have referred to the womb of animals, but is \\"extremely common\\" in Pliny's Natural History for a human uterus.Adams, pp. 100‚Äì101. In the Imperial era, vulva can mean \\"female reproductive organs\\" collectively or vaguely, or sometimes refers to the vagina alone.Adams, pp. 103‚Äì105. Early Latin Bible translators used vulva as the correct and proper word for the womb.Adams, p. 105. At some point during the Imperial era, matrix became the common word for \\"uterus\\", particularly in the gynecological writers of late antiquity, who also employ a specialized vocabulary for parts of the reproductive organs.Adams, pp. 105‚Äì109. Both women and men often removed their pubic hair,Clarke, p. 216. This is particularly characteristic of the 1st century AD, the period from which the most explicit erotic art survives. but grooming may have varied over time and by individual preference. A fragment from the early satirist Lucilius refers to penetrating a \\"hairy bag\\",Lucilius, frg. 61 Warmington: in bulgam penetrare pilosam. and a graffito from Pompeii declares that \\"a hairy cunt is fucked much better than one which is smooth; it's steamy and wants cock\\".CIL 4.1830: futuitur cunnus pilossus multo melliur quam glaber; eadem continet vaporem et eadem vellit mentulam; Younger, p. 75. At the entrance to a caldarium in the bath complex of the House of Menander at Pompeii, an unusual graphic device appears on a mosaic: a phallic oil can is surrounded by strigils in the shape of female genitalia, juxtaposed with an \\"Ethiopian\\" water-bearer who has an \\"unusually large and comically detailed\\" penis.Clarke, pp. 133‚Äì134. Romans tended to identify most black Africans as \\"Ethiopian\\". Breasts Pompeiian wall painting (Secret Museum, Naples) Latin words for \\"breasts\\" include mammae (cf. English \\"mammary\\"), papillae (more specifically for \\"nipples\\"), and ubera, breasts in their capacity to provide nourishment, including the teats or udder of an animal.Breasts are never ubera in Ovid's Amores, but are ubera throughout the Metamorphoses: at 3.31 (metaphorically); 4.324; 10.392; 9.358 (materna ... ubera, \\"motherly breasts\\"); 7.321 and 6.342 (lactantia ubera, \\"milk-producing breasts\\"); 15.117 and 472. Uber (singular) or ubera is used for animals by Ovid, Ars Amatoria 1.350 (the udder of a cow) and 2.375 (the teats of lactating dogs); by Horace, Sermones 1.1.110, Odes 2.19.10, 4.4.14 and 4.15.5, and elsewhere; by Tibullus, for sheep in 1.3.45; by Propertius, 2.34b. Papillae is the preferred word when Catullus and the Augustan poets take note of breasts in an erotic context.Catullus, Carmina 40.12, 61.101, 64.65, 66.81. Ovid takes note of \\"handy nipples\\" (Amores 1.4.37, habiles papillae); see also 1.5.20 and 2.15.11, the poem in which he addresses the ring he's giving to his girlfriend, and fantasizes about the various ways it will touch her, \\"...since I would desire to have touched the breasts of my mistress and to have inserted my left hand within her sheath.\\" The usage of Propertius is more varied; when he wrestles with his naked mistress, her nipples fight back (3.14.20). The breasts of a beautiful woman were supposed to be \\"unobtrusive.\\" Idealized breasts in the tradition of Hellenistic poetry were compared to apples;As for instance at Rufinus 5.60, 62Richlin (1983), pp. 49, 52. Martial makes fun of large breasts.Martial, Epigrams 1.100, 2.52, 14.66, 14.134, 14.149Richlin (1983), p. 54Craig A. Williams Epigrams: Martial (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 181. Old women who were stereotypically ugly and undesirable in every way had \\"pendulous\\" breasts.Richlin (1983), pp. 52, 68. On the Roman stage, exaggerated breasts were part of the costuming for comically unattractive female characters, since in classic Roman comedy women's roles were played by male actors in drag.C.W. Marshall, The Stagecraft and Performance of Roman Comedy (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 65. In the Poenulus of Plautus (line 1416), a flute girl is dismissed as unattractive because both her cheeks and her breasts are overly full; puffing out one's cheeks while playing a wind instrument was considered ugly (as noted by Minerva herself in Ovid's Fasti 6.693‚Äì710). By contrast, in Plautus's Casina (line 848), a character exclaims edepol papillam bellulam, \\"By Pollux, what a pretty little titty!\\" While Greek epigrams describe ideal breasts,Richlin (1983), p. 55. Latin poets take limited interest in them, at least as compared to the modern focus on admiring and fondling a woman's breasts.Richlin (1983), p. 38. They are observed mainly as aspects of a woman's beauty or perfection of form, though Ovid finds them inviting to touch.Ovid, Amores 1.5.20, in a catalogue of his mistress's assets, remarks on \\"the outline of her nipples, ready to be squeezed.\\" See also the catalogue of Philodemus 12 (Palatine Anthology 5.132); Andrew Dalby, Empires of Pleasures: Luxury and Indulgence in the Roman World (Routledge, 2000), pp. 24, 64‚Äì65, 263. In one poem celebrating a wedding, Catullus remarks on the bride's \\"tender nipples\\" (teneris ... papillis), which would keep a good husband sleeping with her; erotic appeal supports fidelity within marriage and leads to children and a long life together.Catullus 61.97‚Äì101, T.P. Wiseman, Catullus and His World: A Reappraisal (Cambridge University Press, 1985, 2002), pp. 114‚Äì115. A mastos, a breast-shaped drinking cup Because all infants were breastfed in antiquity, the breast was viewed primarily as an emblem of nurturing and of motherhood.Larissa Bonfante, \\"Nursing Mothers in Classical Art,\\" in Naked Truths: Women, Sexuality, and Gender in Classical Art and Archaeology (Routledge, 1997, 2000), pp. 174ff., with many examples. The ideal characteristics of the breasts of a wet nurse (nutrix) are enumerated in the Gynaecology of Soranus 2.18‚Äì20. Mastoi, breast-shaped drinking cups, and representations of breasts are among the votive offerings (vota) found at sanctuaries of deities such as Diana and Hercules, sometimes having been dedicated by wet nurses.Celia E. Schultz, Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), pp. 54, 68, 101, 115Younger, p. 36. Breast vota, like representations of other body parts (compare milagro), can also be dedicated at healing sanctuaries as part of seeking a cure for an ailment of the breast, such as mastitis or various tumors the ancients diagnosed as \\"cancer.\\" The breast-shaped cup may have a religious significance; the drinking of breast milk by an adult who is elderly or about to die symbolized potential rebirth in the afterlife.Anthony Corbeill, Nature Embodied: Gesture in Ancient Rome (Princeton University Press, 2004), pp. 101‚Äì103Younger, pp. 35‚Äì36Fritz Graf and Sarah Iles Johnston, Ritual Texts for the Afterlife: Orpheus and the Bacchic Gold Tablets (Routledge, 2007), pp. 128‚Äì129. Perhaps also a reference to the \\"Milky Way\\" as a path to the heavens. In the Etruscan tradition, the goddess Juno (Uni) offers her breast to Hercules as a sign that he may enter the ranks of the immortals.Younger, p. 35Nancy Thomson de Grummond, Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 2006), pp. 83‚Äì84. The religious meaning may underlie the story of how Pero offered breast milk to her elderly father when he was imprisoned and sentenced to death by starvation (see Roman Charity).Valerius Maximus 5.4.1. The scene is among the moral paintings in a Pompeiian bedroom that belonged to a child, along with the legend \\"in sadness is the meeting of modesty and piety\\".Clarke, p. 159. Pliny records medicinal uses of breast milk, and ranks it as one of the most useful remedies, especially for ailments of the eyes and ears. Wrapping one's head in a bra was said to cure a headache.Pliny, Natural History 28.73, 123Hallett, pp. 204‚Äì205. Pero offering her breast milk to her aged father in an act of \\"Roman Charity\\" Baring the breasts is one of the gestures made by women, particularly mothers or nurses, to express mourning or as an appeal for mercy.Corbeill, Nature Embodied, p. 87 et passim. See for instance Seneca, Phaedra 247, Hercules Oetaeus 926. \\"One of the commonest literary motifs for mourning in ancient texts is women baring and beating their breasts,\\" notes Alan Cameron, The Last Pagans of Rome (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 725. The baring and beating of breasts ritually in grief was interpreted by Servius as producing milk to feed the dead.Servius, note to Aeneid 5.78; Corbeill, Nature Embodied, pp. 86‚Äì87. In Greek and Latin literature, mythological mothers sometimes expose their breasts in moments of extreme emotional duress to demand that their nurturing role be respected.Beth Cohen, \\"Divesting the Female Breast of Clothes in Classical Sculpture,\\" in Naked Truths: Women, Sexuality, and Gender in Classical Art and Archaeology (Routledge, 1997), p. 69. Breasts exposed with such intensity held apotropaic power.Claire L. Lyons and Ann Olga Koloski- Ostrow, introduction to Naked Truths, p. 10; Bonfante, \\"Nursing Mothers,\\" pp. 187‚Äì188, relating it to the evil eye and the gaze of Medusa Julius Caesar indicates that the gesture had a similar significance in Celtic culture: during the siege of Avaricum, the female heads of household (matres familiae) expose their breasts and extend their hands to ask that the women and children be spared.Julius Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 7.47.5; G. Matherat, ‚ÄúLe premi√®re campagne de C√©sar contre les Bellovaques et le geste passis manibus,\\" in Hommages √† Albert Grenier (Latomus, 1962), vol. 3. Tacitus notes Germanic women who exhorted their reluctant men to valorous battle by aggressively baring their breasts.Tacitus, Germania 8.1; Bonfante, \\"Nursing Mothers,\\" p. 187. Although in general \\"the gesture is meant to arouse pity rather than sexual desire\\", the beauty of the breasts so exposed is sometimes in evidence and remarked upon.Mary Lefkowitz and Maureen B. Fant, Women's Life in Greece and Rome, p. 350, note 5. A Greek example is found in Euripides, Hecuba 557‚Äì565 when Polyxena, about to become a human sacrifice, shows her courage by exposing \\"breasts and chest as beautiful as a statue's.\\" Because women were normally portrayed clothed in art, bared breasts can signify vulnerability or erotic availability by choice, accident, or force. Baring a single breast was a visual motif of Classical Greek sculpture, where among other situations, including seductions,Other situations include marking a female figure as an Amazon, as part of athletic attire, or for the purpose of nursing an infant. it often represented impending physical violence or rape.Cohen, \\"Divesting the Female Breast,\\" p. 68ff. Some scholars have attempted to find a \\"code\\" in which exposing the right breast had an erotic significance, while the left breast signified nurturing.Cohen, \\"Divesting the Female Breast,\\" p. 79. Although art produced by the Romans may imitate or directly draw on Greek conventions, during the Classical period of Greek art images of women nursing were treated as animalistic or barbaric; by contrast, the coexisting Italic tradition emphasized the breast as a focus of the mother‚Äìchild relationship and as a source of female power.Bonfante, \\"Nursing Mothers,\\" passim and conclusion on p. 188. The erogenous power of the breast was not utterly neglected: in comparing sex with a woman to sex with a boy, a Greek novel of the Roman Imperial era notes that \\"her breast when it is caressed provides its own particular pleasure\\".Achilles Tatius, Leucippe and Clitophon 37.7, as excerpted by Lefkowitz and Fant, Women's Life in Greece and Rome, p. 182. Propertius connects breast development with girls reaching an age to \\"play\\".Necdum inclinatae prohibent te ludere mammae, 2.15.21Thomas Habinek, The World of Roman Song: From Ritualized Speech to Social Order (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), p. 114. Tibullus observes that a woman just might wear loose clothing so that her breasts \\"flash\\" when she reclines at dinner.Tibullus 1.6.18; Dalby, Empire of Pleasures, p. 263. An astrological tradition held that mammary intercourse was enjoyed by men born under the conjunction of Venus, Mercury, and Saturn.Younger, p. 20, citing Manetho 4.312. Even in the most sexually explicit Roman paintings, however, the breasts are sometimes kept covered by the strophium (breast band).Clarke, p. 73Younger, p. 35. The women so depicted may be prostitutes, but it can be difficult to discern why an artist decides in a given scenario to portray the breasts covered or exposed.Examples throughout Clarke. =Female‚Äìfemale sex= Suburban Baths, Pompeii Greek words for a woman who prefers sex with another woman include hetairistria (compare hetaira, \\"courtesan\\" or \\"companion\\"), tribas (plural tribades), and Lesbia; Latin words include the loanword tribas, fricatrix (\\"she who rubs\\"), and virago.Bernadette J. Brooten, Love between Women: Early Christian Responses to Female Homoeroticism (University of Chicago Press, 1996), p. 4. References to sex between women are infrequent in the Roman literature of the Republic and early Principate. Ovid, who advocates generally for a heterosexual lifestyle, finds it \\"a desire known to no one, freakish, novel ... among all animals no female is seized by desire for female\\".Ovid, Metamorphoses 9.727, 733‚Äì4, as cited in Potter (2009), p. 346. During the Roman Imperial era, which many Roman writers perceived as more decadent than the Republican period, sources for same-sex relations among women are more abundant, in the form of love spells, medical writing, texts on astrology and the interpretation of dreams, and other sources.Brooten, Love between Women, p. 1. A graffito from Pompeii expresses the desire of one woman for another: > I wish I could hold to my neck and embrace the little arms, and bear kisses > on the tender lips. Go on, doll, and trust your joys to the winds; believe > me, light is the nature of men.The Latin indicates that the I is of feminine > gender; CIL 4.5296, as cited in Potter (2009), p. 347. An early reference to same-sex relations among women as \\"lesbianism\\" is found in Lucian (2nd century AD): \\"They say there are women like that in Lesbos, masculine-looking, but they don't want to give it up for men. Instead, they consort with women, just like men.\\"Lucian, Dialogues of the Courtesans 5. Since Romans thought a sex act required an active or dominant partner who was \\"phallic\\" (see \\"Phallic sexuality\\" above), male writers imagined that in lesbian sex one of the women would use a dildo or have an exceptionally large clitoris for penetration, and that she would be the one experiencing pleasure.Jonathan Walters, \\"Invading the Roman Body: Manliness and Impenetrability in Roman Thought,\\" pp. 30‚Äì31, and Pamela Gordon, \\"The Lover's Voice in Heroides 15: Or, Why Is Sappho a Man?,\\" p. 283, both in Hallett; Fredrick, p. 168. The dildo is rarely mentioned in Roman sources, but was a popular comic item in Classical Greek literature and art; Potter (2009), p. 351. Martial describes lesbians as having outsized sexual appetites and performing penetrative sex on both women and boys.Martial 1.90 and 7.67, 50; Potter (2009), p. 347 Imperial portrayals of women who sodomize boys, drink and eat like men, and engage in vigorous physical regimens, may reflect cultural anxieties about the growing independence of Roman women.Clarke, p. 228. =Rape= Botticelli's Death of Lucretia (c. 1500): in Roman legend, Lucretia's rape and suicide brought about the overthrow of the monarchy and the formation of the Roman Republic The mythology of rape The rape of women is a pervasive theme in the myths and legends of early Rome. The legendary founders Romulus and Remus were born from the rape of the Vestal Rhea Silvia by the god Mars.Livy 1.3.11‚Äì4.3. Romulus and his \\"band of freebooters\\" can transform their all-male settlement into a city only by the \\"rape\\" of the Sabine women, that is, by forcibly abducting the daughters of their Sabine neighbors to take as wives. The overthrow of the Roman monarchy and the establishment of the Republic was precipitated by the rape of the much-admired Lucretia by Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son. The legend crystallizes the Roman view of unchecked libido as a form of tyranny.Kuttner, p. 348. The Augustan historian Livy seems \\"embarrassed\\" by the rape motif of early Roman history, and emphasizes the redeeming political dimension of these events.Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, pp. 1‚Äì10, as cited and elaborated by Phyllis Culham, \\"Women in the Roman Republic,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 158. Lucretius condemns rape as a primitive behavior outside the bounds of an advanced civilization,Fredrick, p. 105. describing it as \\"a man's use of violent force and imposition of sexual impulse\\".Lucretius, De rerum natura 5.964: Violenta viri vis atque impensa libido. Rape and the law Roman law recognized rape as a crime: the rape victim was not guilty of anything.Staples, p. 81. Intercourse by force or compulsion (vis), even if it took place under circumstances that were otherwise unlawful for a woman (see \\"Moral and legal concepts\\" above), left the woman legally without blame.Staples, p. 82Gardner, pp. 118ff. The official position under Diocletian (reigned 284‚Äì305 AD) held that:Gardner, p. 120. > The laws punish the foul wickedness of those who prostitute their modesty to > the lusts of others, but they do not attach blame to those who are compelled > to stuprum by force, since it has, moreover, been quite properly decided > that their reputations are unharmed and that they are not prohibited from > marriage to others.Digest 9.9.20. Although literary sources from the Republican era make it clear that rape was wrong and severely penalized, the statutes under which it might be charged as a crime are unknown until passage of the Lex Iulia de vi publica, dating probably to the dictatorship of Julius Caesar in the 40s BC.Gardner, p. 118. Rome had no state prosecutors; cases could be prosecuted by any citizen with the legal expertise and speaking ability to do so. Since emancipated women were allowed to bring criminal prosecutions in the Republic,A law passed sometime between 80 and 50 BC banned women from acting as prosecutors in the courtroom; Valerius Maximus 8.3.1; Richard A. Bauman, Women and Politics in Ancient Rome (Routledge, 1992, 1994), p. 50; Joseph Farrell, Latin Language and Latin Culture (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 74‚Äì75; Michael C. Alexander, Trials in the Late Roman Republic, 149‚Äì50 BC (University of Toronto Press, 1990), p. 180. it is conceivable that a rape victim could have brought charges against her rapist herself. Otherwise, the case could be prosecuted by her father or husband, or by anyone who saw fit to do so. There was no statute of limitations for rape; by contrast adultery, which was criminalized under Augustus, had to be prosecuted within five years. Rape was a capital crime. As a matter of law, rape could be committed only against a citizen in good standing. A woman who worked as a prostitute or entertainer lost her social standing and became infamis; by making her body publicly available, she had in effect surrendered her right to be protected from sexual abuse or physical violence.Gardner, p. 119McGinn (1998), p. 326. Cicero defended a client whose misdeeds included the gang rape of an actress on the grounds that young men took customary license with entertainers.Cicero, Pro Planco 30McGinn (1998), p. 326Roy K. Olson, Ars Amatoria, Book 3 (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 386; J.P. Toner, Leisure and Ancient Rome (Blackwell, 1995), p. 68. The rape of a slave could be prosecuted only as damage to her owner's property, under the Lex Aquilia.McGinn (1998), p. 314 Consent would have been an issue in rape cases only rarely; if the accused argued that the woman had consented, he could still be charged with committing the more general sex crime of stuprum against a citizen, since male sexual freedom was limited to prostitutes or slaves. If rape against a married woman could not be proven, the Augustan legislation criminalizing adultery would make the man liable to a charge of adulterium, criminal adultery, though a charge of either adultery or stuprum without force would implicate the woman as well.Gardner, pp. 120‚Äì121. An acquittal for rape, as with any other crime, would open the prosecutor to a retaliatory charge of calumnia, malicious prosecution.Gardner, p. 121. The prosecution of rape might also be hindered by psychological and social pressures, such as embarrassment or a reluctance to expose one's private life. Attitudes toward rape changed when the Empire became Christianized. St. Augustine interpreted Lucretia's suicide as a possible admission that she had secretly encouraged the rapist,Staples, p. 164, citing Norman Bryson, \\"Two Narratives of Rape in the Visual Arts: Lucretia and the Sabine Women,\\" in Rape (Blackwell, 1986), p. 199. Augustine's interpretation of the rape of Lucretia (in City of God 1.19) has generated a substantial body of criticism, starting with Machiavelli's satire. In Augustine of Hippo: A Biography (Faber, 1967), Peter Brown characterized this section of Augustine's work as his most vituperative attack on Roman ideals of virtue. See also Carol J. Adams and Marie M. Fortune, Violence against Women and Children: A Christian Theological Sourcebook (Continuum, 1995), p. 219ff.; Melissa M. Matthes, The Rape of Lucretia and the Founding of Republics (Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000), p. 68ff. (also on Machiavelli); Virginia Burrus, Saving Shame: Martyrs, Saints, and Other Abject Subjects (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008), p. 125ff.; Amy Greenstadt, Rape and the Rise of the Author: Gendering Intention in Early Modern England (Ashgate, 2009), p. 71; Melissa E. Sanchez, Erotic Subjects: The Sexuality of Politics in Early Modern English Literature (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 93ff. Augustine defines sexual integrity (pudicitia) as a purely spiritual quality that physical defilement cannot taint; as indicated throughout this article, the Romans viewed rape and other forms of stuprum within a political context as crimes against the citizen's liberty. and Christian apologists regarded her as having committed the sin of involuntary sexual pleasure.Staples, p. 164. The first Christian emperor Constantine redefined rape as a public offense rather than as a private wrong.James A. Brundage, Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe (University of Chicago Press, 1987, 1990), p. 107. Earlier Roman law had blurred the line between abduction and elopement, since in either case it was the right of the paterfamilias to give or withhold his consent to his daughter's marriage that had been violated. The word raptus thus could refer to a successful seduction as well as abduction or rape. If the girl consented, Constantine ordered that she be punished along with the male \\"abductor\\" by being burnt alive. If she had not consented, she was still considered an accomplice, \\"on the grounds that she could have saved herself by screaming for help\\". As a participant to the rape, she was punished under law by being disinherited, regardless of the wishes of her family.Charles Matson Odahl, Constantine and the Christian Empire (Routledge, 2004), p. 179; Timothy David Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius (Harvard University Press, 1981), p. 220; Gillian Clark, Women in Late Antiquity: Pagan and Christian Lifestyles (Oxford University Press, 1993), pp. 36‚Äì37, characterizing Constantine's law as \\"unusually dramatic even for him.\\" Even if she and her family consented to a marriage as the result of an elopement, the marriage was legally void. In the Republic and the pre-Christian Empire, the consequences of an abduction or an elopement had been up to the couple and their families.Theodosian Code 9.24.1.2‚Äì3; Cod. 9.13.1; Brundage, Law, Sex, and Christian Society, p. 107. Sexuality and children bulla, which contained a phallic charm Both male and female freeborn children wore the toga praetexta, a purple-bordered garment that marked its wearer as having \\"inviolable\\" status.The purple border appeared also on the togas of magistrates whose duties including presiding over sacrifices, on the toga worn by a mourning son when he carried out a parent's funeral rites, and on the veils of the Vestal Virgins; Judith Lynn Sebesta, \\"Women's Costume and Feminine Civic Morality in Augustan Rome,\\" Gender & History 9.3 (1997), p. 532, and \\"Symbolism in the Costume of the Roman Woman,\\" p. 47. An oath could be sworn upon the \\"sacred praetexta\\", a marker of how \\"we make sacred and venerable the weakness of childhood\\".In a declamation attributed to Quintilian, Declamatio minor 340.13 as quoted by Sebesta, \\"Women's Costume,\\" p. 532. Persius, Satire 5.30‚Äì31, calls the praetexta the guardian (custos) of childhood. It was religiously impermissible (nefas) to use obscene language in front of those wearing the praetexta,Praetextatis nefas sit obsceno verbo uti: Festus 282‚Äì283 L = 245 M). and Cato claimed that in front of his son he tried to speak as though Vestal Virgins were present.Plutarch, Life of Cato 20.5Williams, p. 69. Freeborn Roman boys also wore an apotropaic amulet called the bulla which incorporated a phallic talisman (fascinum) inside a locket of gold, silver, or bronze, or in a leather pouch.Pliny, Natural History 28.29; Varro, De lingua latina 7.97Habinek, p. 166Judith Lynn Sebesta, \\"Symbolism in the Costume of the Roman Woman,\\" in The World of Roman Costume (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 47. In addition to its magical function, the bulla would have been a visible warning that the boy was sexually off-limits.Plutarch, Moralia 288aHabinek, p. 39Richlin (1993), pp. 545‚Äì546. The equivalent for the girl was the lunula, a crescent moon amulet.Sebesta, \\"Symbolism in the Costume of the Roman Woman,\\" pp. 47, 51. There is only slight and ambiguous evidence that they too might wear a bulla, at Plautus, Rudens 1194. There were laws protecting freeborn children from sexual predators,Richlin (1993), p. 563Paulus, Digest 47.11.1.2. and the rape of a freeborn boy was a capital crime; this severity was directed at protecting the integrity of the young citizen.Fantham, p. 130 Fictional license was not a defense; Valerius Maximus reports that a poetic boast of seducing a puer praetextatus (\\"praetextate boy\\") and a freeborn virgin (ingenua virgo) was used in court to impugn a prosecutor's moral authority.Valerius Maximus 8.1 absol. 8, as cited by Kelly Olson, \\"The Appearance of the Young Roman Girl,\\" in Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture, p. 142. In denouncing the debaucheries of Quintus Apronius, Cicero builds to the worst offence: Apronius danced naked at a banquet in front of a boy still of an age to wear the praetexta.Cicero, Verrine 3.23. Although children were taken to dinner parties (convivia) to accustom them to proper adult social behavior, Quintilian scolds parents of his day for being poor role models: they parade their mistresses and male concubines and behave indiscreetly even when their children are present, and think it's cute when their children say things that are age-inappropriate. Quintilian regards this misbehavior as a sign of general moral decline.Quintiltian, Institution Oratoria 1.2.7‚Äì8; Matthew B. Roller, Dining Posture in Ancient Rome (Princeton University Press, 2006), p. 160. At weddings, however, boys were by ancient custom given license to speak obscenely, peppering the new couple with dirty jokes, as humor and laughter were thought to promote fertility.Robinson Ellis, A Commentary to Catullus (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1876), p. 180, in reference to Catullus, Carmen 61. Protections applied only to freeborn children, not those born to slaves, sold into slavery, or taken captive in war. The social acceptance of pederasty among the Romans was focused on the exploitation of young male slaves or prostitutes by men of the upper classes.Elizabeth Manwell, \\"Gender and Masculinity,\\" in A Companion to Catullus (Blackwell, 2007), p. 118. =Rites of passage= Adolescents in ritual preparation to transition to adult status wore the tunica recta, the \\"upright tunic\\", so called because it was woven ritually on the type of upright loom that was the earliest used by Romans.Sebesta, \\"Women's Costume,\\" p. 533. The tunic, worn by both youths and maidens, may have had the purple band of inviolability, though this is unclear from the evidence. Girls wove their own tunica recta.Sebesta, \\"Women's Costume,\\" p. 534. The puberty ritual for the young male involved shaving his first beard and taking off his bulla, which he dedicated to the household gods, the Lares.Persius 5.30‚Äì31. He assumed the toga virilis (\\"toga of manhood\\"), was enrolled as a citizen on the census, and soon began his military service.Larissa Bonfante, introduction to The World of Roman Costume, p. 7; Shelley Stone, \\"The Toga: From National to Ceremonial Costume,\\" in The World of Roman Costume, p. 41; Sebesta, \\"Women's Costume,\\" p. 533. After the Augustan building program, the rites were held at the new Temple of Mars Ultor in the Forum Augustum: Dominic Montserrat, \\"Reading Gender in the Roman World,\\" in Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity, and Power in the Roman Empire (Routledge, 2000), p. 170. Traditionally, the ceremony was held on the Liberalia, the festival in honor of the god Liber, who embodied both political and sexual liberty.Other dates could be chosen for the ceremony. See Staples, p. 89; George, \\"The 'Dark Side' of the Toga,\\" p. 55; Propertius 3.15.3‚Äì6; Ovid, Fasti 3.777‚Äì778. Following his rite of passage, the young male citizen was permitted the avenues of sexual activity that were generally acceptable for Roman men of his social rank. Often a young man would be introduced to heterosexual intercourse by an experienced female prostitute.Richlin (1993), p. 535, citing Martial 11.78. Roman women were expected to remain virgins until marriage; the higher a girl's social rank, the earlier she was likely to become betrothed and married.Judith P. Hallett, Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society: Women and the Elite Family (Princeton University Press, 1984), 142; Beryl Rawson, \\"The Roman Family in Italy\\" (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 21; The usual age of betrothal for upper classes girls was 14, but for patricians as early as 12. Weddings were often postponed until the girl was considered mature enough. The wedding ceremony was in part a rite of passage for the bride, as Rome lacked the elaborate female puberty rituals of ancient Greece.Girls coming of age dedicated their dolls to Diana, the goddess most concerned with girlhood, or to Venus when they were preparing for marriage; Beryl Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 48 on Diana; p. 128, citing Persius 2.70 and the related scholion; p. 145 on comparison with Greece. On the night before the wedding, the bride bound up her hair with a yellow hairnet she had woven. The confining of her hair signified the harnessing of her sexuality within marriage. Her weaving of the tunica recta and the hairnet demonstrated her skill and her capacity for acting in the traditional matron's role as custos domi, \\"guardian of the house\\".Sebesta, \\"Women's Costume,\\" pp. 529, 534, 538. On her wedding day, she belted her tunic with the cingulum, made of ewe wool to symbolize fertility, and tied with the \\"knot of Hercules\\", which was supposed to be difficult to untie.Sebesta, \\"Women's Costume,\\" pp. 534‚Äì535; Festus 55L on the nodus Herculaneus, which was used for its apotropaic powers on jewelry as well. The Roman Hercules was a giver of fertility and a great scatterer of seed: he fathered, according to Verrius Flaccus, seventy children. The knot symbolized wifely chastity, in that it was to be untied only by her husband, but the cingulum also symbolized that the groom was bound to his wife.Cinctus vinctusque, according to Festus 55 (edition of Lindsay); Karen K. Hersch, The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 101, 110, 211 . The bride's hair was ritually styled in \\"six tresses\\" (seni crines), and she was veiled until uncovered by her husband at the end of the ceremony, a ritual of surrendering her virginity to him.Sebesta, \\"Women's Costume,\\" p. 535. Sex, marriage, and society=Marital sex= Because men could enjoy sexual relations outside marriage with relative impunity, it has sometimes been assumed that satisfying sex was not an expectation of Roman marriage.Susan Dixon, The Roman Family (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), pp. 86‚Äì88. The jurist Ulpian noted that \\"it is not sexual intercourse that makes a marriage but rather marital affection\\",Non enim coitus matrimonium facit, sed maritalis affectio, Ulpian, Ulpianus libro trigesimo tertio ad Sabinum, Digest 24.1.32.13, as cited by Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, A Casebook on Family Law (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 49. but the warnings by moralists and philosophers against a preoccupation with sex within marriage recognize the potential for marital passion.Dixon, The Roman Family, pp. 86‚Äì88. Sexual intimacy between a married couple was a private matter, and not usually the subject of literature.James A. Brundage, Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe (University of Chicago Press, 1987, 1990), p. 22, citing Philippe Ari√®s, \\"L'amour dans le mariage,\\" in Sexualit√©s occidentales, √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales, Centre d'√âtudes Transdisciplinaires, Communications 35 (Paris: Seuil, 1982), p. 121Potter (2009), p. 350. An exception was the epithalamium, a genre of poetry that celebrated a wedding. A wedding hymn by Catullus, for instance, praises the love goddess Venus because \\"nothing is possible without you\\".Catullus, Carmen 61: nil potest sine te Venus. Ovid, whose love poetry early in his career was directed at fictional mistresses, wrote elegies during his exile in which he longed for his wife.Dixon, The Roman Family, p. 87. Among the collected letters of Pliny Minor is one he writes about his feelings for his wife: > I am seized by an unbelievable longing for you. The reason is above all my > love, but secondarily the fact that we are not used to being apart. This is > why I spend the greater part of the night haunted by your image; this is why > from time to time my feet lead me (the right expression!) of their own > accord to your room at the times I was accustomed to frequent you; this is > why, in short, I retreat, morbid and disconsolate, like an excluded lover > from an unwelcoming doorway. Pliny adopts the rhetoric of love poetry, conventionally directed at an illicit or hard-to-attain lover, as appropriate for expressing his wedded desire. Although it was a point of pride for a woman to be univira, married only once,Univira is one of the attributes that might be memorialized on a woman's gravestone. there was no stigma attached to divorce. Speedy remarriage after divorce or the death of a spouse was common and even expected among the Roman elite, since marriage was considered right and natural for adults.Susan Treggiari, Roman Marriage: Iusti Coniuges from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian (Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 258‚Äì259, 500‚Äì502 et passim. Although widows were usually expected to wait ten months before remarrying, even a pregnant woman was not barred from taking a new husband, as long as the paternity of her child was not in doubt for legal purposes.Eva Cantarella, \\"Marriage and Sexuality in Republican Rome: A Roman Conjugal Love Story,\\" in The Sleep of Reason, p. 276. If a first marriage ended, women seem to have had more say in arranging subsequent marriages. While having children was a primary goal of marriage, other social and familial bonds were enhanced, not excluding personal companionship and sexual pleasure between husband and wife, as indicated by marriages involving women past their childbearing years.Beryl Rawson, \\"Finding Roman Women,\\" in A Companion to the Roman Republic (Blackwell, 2010), p. 338. The Trojan royal couple Hector and Andromache became a mythological trope of wedded sex. Latin love elegy focuses on their sex life rather than the tragic end of their marriage with Hector's death at the hands of Achilles.Propertius, 2.22 B, 31‚Äì34 Heyworth; Ovid, Amores 1.9.35‚Äì36, Ars Amatoria 2.709‚Äì710 and 3.107‚Äì110, Heroides 5.107; Barbara Graziosi and Johannes Haubold, Homer: Iliad Book VI (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 52. See also Martial 11.104.13‚Äì14, where the couple's lovemaking is so intensely erotic that it drives the household slaves to masturbate. They were known for the \\"woman on top\\" position, with a verb suggesting that the woman \\"rides\\" the man like a horse.Helen King, \\"Sowing the Field: Greek and Roman Sexology,\\" in Sexual Knowledge, Sexual Science: The History of Attitudes to Sexuality (Cambridge University Press, 1994), p. 38. In general, Hector was portrayed as markedly heterosexualWilliam Armstrong Percy III, \\"Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities,\\" in Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity, p. 20. and an exemplary husband.Graziosi and Haubold, Homer, p. 52. The wedding night An epithalamium by CatullusCatullus, Carmen 61. paints the wedding night as a time of ripe eroticism, spiced with humorous and bawdy songs from the guests. \\"Look inside,\\" the poet advises the bride, who burns with an \\"intimate flame\\", \\"where your man lies on the richly arrayed bed, completely available to you\\". The husband is reminded that \\"good Venus\\" has blessed him, since he can now desire openly what he desires, and need not conceal a \\"good love\\". The couple is encouraged to enjoy themselves as they please (ludite ut lubet); the goal is to produce children soon. A pair of paintings in a bedroom of the Casa della Farnesina has been interpreted as \\"a narrative of the modest bride becoming the immodest lover‚Äîperhaps fulfilling a ribald male fantasy\\".Clarke, pp. 99‚Äì104, quotation pp. 103‚Äì104. Fidelity and adultery Some literary passages suggest that a newlywed might break off his outside sexual relations for a time and focus on bonding with his wife in the hope of starting a family.For example, Catullus 61.123, where a concubinus, a male concubine, expects that his master's wedding will cause him to be abandoned; James L. Butrica, \\"Some Myths and Anomalies in the Study of Roman Sexuality,\\" in Same- Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity, pp. 218, 224. Some Stoics maintained that marital fidelity was as much a virtue for men as for women (see \\"Stoic sexual morality\\" above). Legally, however, a Roman husband did not commit adultery when he had sex outside marriage as long as his partner was considered sexually available; sexual misconduct (stuprum) was adultery depending on the status of a female partner. A character in a play by Plautus expresses a man's sexual freedom in comic terms: > No one prohibits anyone from going down the public way (publica via); as > long as you do not make a path through posted land, as long as you hold off > from brides, single women, maidens, the youth and free boys, love whatever > you want.Plautus, Curculio 35‚Äì38. The passage is something of a topos of > Roman sexuality; in addition to Richlin (following), see Fantham, p. 123. A married or marriageable woman and young male citizens are off-limits, just as if they were the property of someone else, and in fact adultery as a crime was committed contrary to the rights of the paterfamilias to control his household.Fantham, p. 125. For a man, adultery was a sexual offense committed with a woman who was neither his wife nor a permissible partner such as a prostitute or slave, in effect when his female partner was another man's wife or his unmarried daughter.Nussbaum, p. 305. The later jurists emphasize that adulterium in the strict sense was committed with a married woman.Fantham, p. 124, citing Papinian, De adulteriis I and Modestinus, Liber Regularum I. For a married woman, no infidelity was acceptable, and first-time brides were expected to be virgins.Judith P. Hallett, Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society: Women and the Elite Family (Princeton University Press, 1984), 142. According to Cato (2nd century BC), a husband had an ancient right (ius) to kill his wife if he caught her in the act of adultery, but if this \\"right\\" existed, it was a matter of custom and not statute law.Susan Dixon, The Roman Family (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 202. In the Republic, adultery was normally considered a private matter for families to deal with, not a serious criminal offense requiring the attention of the courts.Cantarella, p. 104Edwards, pp. 34‚Äì35Nussbaum, p. 305, noting that custom \\"allowed much latitude for personal negotiation and gradual social change.\\" No source records the justified killing of a woman for adultery by either a father or husband during the Republican era, though adultery was grounds for divorce.Edwards, p. 38. The mythological adultery of Venus and Mars, here attended by Cupid, was a popular subject for painting Following the collapse of the Republic, moral legislation became part of the new political order under Rome's first emperor, Augustus. Laws pertaining to adultery passed in 18 BC were part of his program to restore the mos maiorum, traditional social norms, while consolidating his political authority and codifying a more rigid social hierarchy in the wake of the recent civil wars. The appeal to old-fashioned values cloaked the radical overthrow of the Republic's participatory political institutions by top-down, one-man rule.Hallett, pp. 34ff., 41‚Äì42, 67, 89‚Äì90. The Lex Iulia de adulteriis (\\"Julian Law concerning acts of adultery\\") was directed at punishing married women who engaged in extra-marital affairs. Scholars have often assumed that the Lex Iulia was meant to address a virulent outbreak of adultery in the Late Republic. An androcentric perspective in the early 20th century held that the Lex Iulia had been \\"a very necessary check upon the growing independence and recklessness of women\\".P.E. Corbett, The Roman Law of Marriage (1930), as cited by Edwards, p. 35. A more sympathetic view in the late 20th to early 21st century saw love affairs as a way for the intelligent, independent women of the elite to form emotionally meaningful relationships outside marriages arranged for political purposes.Beryl Rawson, The Family in Ancient Rome (Cornell University Press, 1987), p. 27, as cited by Edwards, pp. 35‚Äì36. It is possible, however, that no such epidemic of adultery even existed; the law should perhaps be understood not as addressing a real problem that threatened society, but as one of the instruments of social control exercised by Augustus that cast the state, and by extension himself, in the role of paterfamilias to all Rome.Edwards, pp. 34‚Äì36. Personal anxieties about infidelity, within marriage or not, are reflected in magic spells intended to \\"fix\\" (defixiones) or bind the other person's erotic attachment.Matthew W. Dickie, Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World (Routledge, 2003), p. 36. Defixiones are also known as curse tablets; erotic prohibitions are only one form of defixio. Spells were also available for interrogating the beloved about fidelity. One magical papyrus from Roman Egypt recommends placing the heart of a hoopoe on a sleeping woman's genitals to induce truthful answers; another says that the tongue of a hen placed on her lips or breast will cause her to reveal the name of the man she loves.Dickie, Magic and Magicians, p. 116. Literature of the Late Republic and Principate, particularly the satires of Horace and Juvenal, offer various depictions, or perhaps fantasies, of how a wronged husband might subject his wife's lover to humiliation and punishment. In these literary treatments, the adulterer is castrated, beaten, raped by the husband himself or his slaves, or penetrated anally with a mullet, a type of prized fish cultivated by elite Romans as a leisure activity (otium). References to such acts do not appear in the letters of Cicero nor the histories of Tacitus, and may be fictional exaggerations.\\"The men who people the pages of Cicero and Tacitus do not burst into their wives' bedrooms to take violent revenge (even when license was granted by the law),\\" notes Edwards, pp. 55‚Äì56. Ovid makes fun of the jealous husband as lacking in sophistication: \\"The man who's excessively wounded by his wife's adulterous affairs is a hick.\\"Edwards, p. 56, citing Ovid, Amores 3.4.37: rusticus est nimium quem laedit adultera coniunx. Ovid's predecessor Catullus wrote poetry celebrating his adulterous affair with \\"Lesbia\\", his social superior, traditionally identified as Clodia. The cultivation of a laissez-faire attitude as a sign of urbanity may have prompted the provision of Augustus's adultery law that required a husband to divorce his wife and bring formal legal charges against her, or face charges himself for pimping (lenocinium).Edwards, p. 56. =Master-slave relations= Sexuality was a \\"core feature\\" of ancient Roman slavery.Harper, p. 26. Because slaves were regarded as property under Roman law, an owner could use them for sex or hire them out to service other people.Fantham, pp. 118, 128. Some scholars propose that content in Cicero's letters indicate he had a long-term homosexual relationship with his slave Tiro.Neville Morley, \\"Social Structure and Demography,\\" in A Companion to the Roman Republic, p. 309, describes the relationship as \\"intimate and affectionate.\\" See Pliny, Epistle 7.4.6, where he claims to preserve an epigram by Cicero on Tiro, which reveals Tiro's \\"effeminate subordination,\\" as described by Ellen Oliensis, \\"The Erotics of amicitia: Readings in Tibullus, Propertius, and Horace,\\" in Hallett, p. 171, note 37. See also comments on the epigram by Richlin (1983), pp. 34 and 223, who thinks it may have been Pliny's joke. As Eva Cantarella stated bluntly, \\"the Roman paterfamilias was an absolute master, ... he exercised a power outside any control of society and the state. In this situation why on earth should he refrain from sodomising his houseboys?\\"Cantarella, p. 99.Martial (6.39) observed that the power of the paterfamilias was so absolute that having sex with his own son was technically not a transgression (nefas), as noted by John Boswell, Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century (University of Chicago Press, 1980), p. 67. But this form of sexual release thus held little erotic cachet: to use one's own slaves was \\"one step up from masturbation\\".Parker, p. 286. In describing the ideal partner in pederasty, Martial prefers a slave boy who \\"acts more like a free man than his master\\", that is, one who can frame the affair as a stimulating game of courtship.William Fitzgerald, Slavery and the Roman Literary Imagination (Cambridge University Press, 2000), pp. 47‚Äì48Hubbard, Thomas K. (2003) Homosexuality in Greece and Rome: A Sourcebook of Basic Documents. University of California Press. p. 13. . When figures identifiable as slaves appear in erotic art, they are performing routine tasks in the background, not taking part in sex acts.Excluding those presumed to be prostitutes, who might be either slaves or infames; Parker, p. 283. In his work on the interpretation of dreams (c. 170 AD), Artemidorus takes a symbolic view of the sexual value of slaves: to dream of having sex with one's own female slave was a good thing, \\"for slaves are the dreamer's possession; therefore taking pleasure in them signifies the dreamer's being pleased with his own possessions\\".Artemidorus, p. 88.5‚Äì12 PackPotter (2009), p. 340. A Roman could exploit his own slaves for sex, but was not entitled to compel any enslaved person he chose to have sex, since the owner had the right to control his own property. In the pursuit of sex with a slave who belonged to someone else, persuasion or threats might be employed. A charge of rape could not be brought against a free man who forced a slave to have sex, since a slave lacked the legal standing that protected a citizen's body, but the owner could prosecute the rapist under the Lex Aquilia, a law pertaining to property damage.McGinn (1998), p. 314. A slave's sexuality was closely controlled. Slaves had no right to legal marriage (conubium), though they could live together as husband and wife (contubernales). An owner usually restricted the heterosexual activities of his male slaves to females he also owned; any children born from these unions added to his wealth. Cato, at a time when Rome's large-scale slave economy was still in early development, thought it good practice to monitor his slaves' sex lives, and required male slaves to pay a fee for access to their female fellow slaves.Plutarch, Life of the Elder Cato 21.2; Sandra R. Joshel and Sheila Murnaghan, introduction to Women and Slaves in Greco-Roman Culture: Differential Equations (Routledge, 1998), p. 11. Grotesque figurine of an ithyphallic slave: in Roman comedy, slaves are often portrayed as oversexed If an owner found that his male slave was having a sexual relationship with a free woman, the law required that he warn the couple three times to break it off. If the affair continued, he had the right to take ownership of the woman.Cantarella, p. 103. References to women from respectable families having sex with a male slave are infrequent, indicating that male writers were not preoccupied with the risk of it.Parker, p. 281. Cicero offers no examples in either the gossipy parts of his letters or in court cases where he attacks the reputation of a woman: he accuses Clodia of incest and of running her house like a brothel, but not of sleeping with slaves. Not even Messalina or Sallust's Sempronia is accused in the hostile sources of having sex with a slave.Parker, p. 283. Sex with a slave was among the trumped-up charges against Claudia Octavia, the wife of Nero, when Poppaea Sabina campaigned to take her place,Tacitus, Annales 14.60, as cited by Williams, p. 399. but mostly it was a matter for innuendo or insult against a husband who failed to prevent it.Mostly in Juvenal and Martial, as in the latter's epigram 6.39, where the seven children of Cinna were supposedly fathered by various slaves of the household; Parker, p. 292. Despite the external controls and restrictions placed on a slave's sexuality, Roman art and literature perversely often portray slaves as lascivious, voyeuristic, and even sexually knowing.Harper, pp. 203‚Äì204. One of the themes of Roman comedy that distinguishes it from its Greek models is the depiction of master-slave relations.Williams, pp. 36‚Äì38. Freeborn Romans who fell into slavery were supposed to be protected from sexual exploitation, as indicated by two different stories recorded by ancient historians.Livy 8.28 (see also Dionysius of Halicarnassus 16.5); Valerius Maximus 6.1.9. The historicity of these stories is questionable, and they should perhaps be regarded as exempla encapsulating themes of historical events; see Cantarella, pp. 104‚Äì105, and Gary Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War (University of California Press, 2005, 2006), p. 313, where the names are seen as \\"clearly fictitious.\\" Before the abolition of debt bondage in the 4th century BC,By the Lex Poetelia Papiria in 326 BC (or 313, according to Varro). free Romans were sometimes driven to sell themselves or their children into slavery when they were overwhelmed by debt. According to Livy, debt slavery (nexum) was abolished as a direct result of the attempted sexual abuse of a freeborn youth who served as surety for his father's debtDionysius's version says the youth went into debt to pay for his father's funeral, an act of Roman piety. with the usurer Lucius Papirius. The boy, Gaius Publilius, was notably beautiful, and Papirius insisted that as a bond slave he was required to provide sexual services. When Publilius refused, Papirius had him stripped and whipped. The youth then took to the streets to display his injuries, and an outcry among the people led the consuls to convene the senate. The political process eventually led to the Lex Poetelia Papiria, which prohibited holding debtors in bondage for their debt and required instead that the debtor's property be used as collateral. The law thus established that the integrity of a Roman citizen's body was fundamental to the concept of libertas, political liberty, in contrast to the uses to which a slave's body was subject.The abolition of debt bondage was facilitated by the spread of chattel slavery for agricultural labor; thus during the period of Roman conquest and expansionism on the Italian peninsula, the distinction arises between a Roman citizen with rights and an \\"Italian\\" who might be enslaved; see John W. Rich, \\"Tiberius Gracchus, Land and Manpower,\\" in Crises and the Roman Empire. Proceedings of the Seventh Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Nijmegen, June 20‚Äì24, 2006) (Brill, 2007), p. 160. In this and a similar incident reported by Valerius Maximus, corporal punishment and sexual abuse are seen as similar violations of the citizen's freedom from physical compulsion, in contrast to the slave's physical vulnerability.In the similar story from Valerius Maximus, a young man named Titus Veturius, whose father was a bankrupt Roman magistrate, had placed himself in slavery with Publius Plotius, who had attempted to seduce him (stuprare). When Veturius refused, Plotius whipped him. Veturius then complained to the consuls, who took the complaint to the senate. Plotius was jailed. See Cantarella, pp. 104‚Äì105Williams, pp. 102‚Äì103, emphasizing that the homosexual nature of Plotius's libido is not at issue, but rather his violation of a freeborn Roman male's body; Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome, pp. 313‚Äì314; Butrica, \\"Some Myths and Anomalies in the Study of Roman Sexuality,\\" pp. 214‚Äì215. Some sexual protections could be extended to slaves. The conduct of slaves reflected generally on the respectability of the household, and the materfamilias in particular was judged by her female slaves' sexual behavior, which was expected to be moral or at least discreet. This decorum may have limited the exploitation of female slaves that were part of the familia.Harper, pp. 294‚Äì295. Seneca expressed Stoic indignation that a male slave should be groomed effeminately and used sexually, because a slave's human dignity should not be debased.Nussbaum, p. 308, citing Seneca, Epistula 47. The burgeoning trade in eunuch slaves during the early Empire prompted legislation under the emperor Hadrian that prohibited the castration of a slave against his will \\"for lust or gain\\".Ra'anan Abusch, \\"CIrcumcision and Castration under Roman Law in the Early Empire,\\" in The Covenant of Circumcision: New Perspectives on an Ancient Jewish Rite (Brandeis University Press, 2003), pp. 77‚Äì78. Legal agreements on the sale of a slave might include a ne serva prostituatur covenant that prohibited the employment of the slave as a prostitute. Although concern for the slave's welfare may have been a factor in individual cases, this legal restriction seems also to have been intended to shield the male citizen owner from the shame or infamia associated with pimping and prostitution. The ne serva covenant remained in force for subsequent sales, even if the buyer was initially unaware of it, and if it was violated, the illegally prostituted slave was granted freedom.McGinn (1998), p. 288ff., especially p. 297 on manumission. From a legalistic perspective, the covenant was not subject to negotiation for subsequent sales, because that would implicitly violate it. =Prostitution= Lupanar (brothel) of Pompeii Prostitution was legal throughout the Roman Empire in all periods. Most prostitutes were slaves or freedwomen. Prostitutes in Rome had to register with the aediles. Despite what might seem to be a clear distinction as a matter of law, the jurist Ulpian opined that an openly promiscuous woman brought the status of prostitute upon herself, even if she accepted no money.Hallett, p. 76, citing Ulpian, Digest 23.2.43.3. The Augustan moral legislation that criminalized adultery exempted prostitutes, who could legally have sex with a married man. Encouraged to think of adultery as a matter of law rather than morality, a few socially prominent women even chose to avoid prosecution for adultery by registering themselves as prostitutes.Habinek, p. 29. Confused status frequently results in plot complications in the comedies of Plautus and Terence. Obstacles to love arise when a young man falls in love with, and wishes to marry, a non-citizen prostitute, and are overcome when the young woman's true status as a freeborn virgin is revealed. The well-brought- up freeborn virgin is marriageable, and the non-citizen prostitute is not.Langlands, pp. 205‚Äì206. The relation of these comic situations to real life is problematic: Plautus and Terence drew on Greek models which are often little known, and so the extent to which they incorporated Roman social behaviors and attitudes is hard to determine. Elaine Fantham has observed that prolonged military campaigning in Greece and Asia Minor had introduced Roman men to a more sophisticated standard of luxury and pleasure, perhaps reflected by comedy: the young man acts out his infatuation with an expensive courtesan instead of a family slave or common prostitute.Fantham, p. 139. Prostitutes appear in erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum, including wall paintings from buildings identified as brothels, in which they are often nude except for a strapless bra (strophium). The paintings illustrate various sexual positions that contradict some scholarly claims about the preferences of Roman men in heterosexual acts.Clarke Literary sources record that prostitutes wore distinctive clothing, often gaudy dresses of see-through silk. They were the only Roman women who wore the toga, the distinctive dress of a free Roman male. This crossing of gender boundaries has been interpreted variously.Hallett, p. 81. Pleasure and infamy Prostitutes were among those persons in Rome categorized as infames, enjoying few legal protections even if they were technically not slaves.Hallett, p. 66. Infamia as a legal status once entered into could not be escaped: a prostitute was \\"not only a woman who practices prostitution, but also one who has formerly done so, even though she has ceased to act in this manner; for the disgrace is not removed even if the practice is subsequently discontinued\\".According to the Lex Iulia et Papia, as cited in Women's Life in Greece and Rome: A Sourcebook in Translation, edited by Mary R. Lefkowitz and Maureen B. Fant (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005, 3rd ed.), p. 118. In the Roman moral tradition, pleasure (voluptas) was a dubious pursuit. The Stoic moralist Seneca contrasts pleasure with virtue (virtus): > Virtue you will find in the temple, in the forum, in the senate house, > standing before the city walls, dusty and sunburnt, her hands rough; > pleasure you will most often find lurking around the baths and sweating > rooms, and places that fear the police, in search of darkness, soft, effete, > reeking of wine and perfume, pallid or else painted and made up with > cosmetics like a corpse.Seneca, De vita beata 7.3Hallett, p. 84. Juvenal thought the retiarius (left), a gladiator who fought with face and flesh exposed, was effeminate and prone to sexual devianceJuvenal, Satires 2 and 8; Michael Carter, \\"(Un)Dressed to Kill: Viewing the Retiarius,\\" in Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture (University of Toronto Press, 2008), pp. 120‚Äì121. Roman ambivalence toward physical pleasure is expressed by the infamia of those whose bodies provided it publicly.Hallett, pp. 66‚Äì67. In a technical sense, infamia was an official loss of legal standing for a freeborn person as a result of misconduct, including sexual misconduct, but the word could be used for ill repute in general.Both the censors and the praetors could impose infamia as a legal status; McGinn (1998), p. 65ff. Infamia was an \\"inescapable consequence\\" of certain professions, including not only prostitutes and pimps but performers such as actors, dancers, and gladiators:Hallett, p. 67. The Tabula Heracleensis, \\"probably from the time of Julius Caesar,\\" lists those who are barred from holding local magistracies, including anyone \\"who has or shall ... have been hired out for the purpose of fighting as a gladiaor ... or who has or shall have prostituted his person; or who has been or shall have been a trainer of gladiators or actors, or who shall run a brothel\\" (as quoted by Hallett, p. 70). Although infamia can be used as a legal term and was codified as such by the time of Hadrian, in the Republic and Principate it also has a non-technical, social sense. \\"These figures were the objects of other people's desires. They served the pleasure of others. They were tarnished by exposure to the public gaze.\\" Those labeled infames (singular infamis) were liable to corporal punishment, usually reserved for slaves.Hallett, p. 73. Under the Republic and early Empire, one of the ways in which the citizen's liberty was defined was through the freedom of his body from physical coercion or punishment such as flogging by authorities.Hallett, pp. 73‚Äì74. By the 2nd and 3rd centuries, low-status free persons were increasingly subjected to various forms of corporal punishment, as republican ideals vanished. Citizens who chose to become public performers, however, and to use their bodies to offer public pleasure,Even trades which served sensual pleasures (voluptates) were considered less honorable than others, including fishmongers, butchers, cooks, poulterers, fishermen, and perfumers, all of whom Cicero classed with dancers and performers of the ludus talarius (De officiis 1.150, citing the playwright Terence); Hallett, p. 83. were excluded from these physical protections, and could be beaten or otherwise subjected to violence.Hallett, pp. 74‚Äì75. Any free man who became a gladiator took an oath to suffer branding, bondage, and beating, as well as potential death by the sword.Hallett, p. 77. Both glamorized and despised, the gladiator was supposed to exert a compelling sexual allure over women.Hallett, pp. 77‚Äì78Michael Carter, \\"(Un)Dressed to Kill: Viewing the Retiarius,\\" in Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 114 et passim. Actors were sexually ambiguous, in part because they could imitate women,In tragedy and the literary comedies of Plautus and Terence, female roles were played by masked men in drag. Hallett, p. 80Juvenal, Satire 3.95‚Äì97. and were attractive to both men and women. The dictator Sulla had a long-term affair with an actor;Plutarch, Life of Sulla 3.3. Maecenas, the arts patron and advisor to Augustus, was in love with an actor named Bathyllus;Tacitus, Annales 1.54. and women of the Imperial family are alleged to have had affairs with actors.Including \\"the wives of Claudius and Domitian\\": Hallett, p. 80. Actresses were assumed to be prostitutes. A man who enjoyed receiving anal sex or providing oral sex, often characterized as a cinaedus, might also be stigmatized as infamis, though if he was a citizen he could retain his legal standing.Richlin (1993), 550‚Äì551, 555ff. Private sex clubs Archaeological evidence, primarily from Pompeii and Herculaneum, and literary sources seem to indicate the existence of private \\"sex clubs\\" in some Roman homes (dom≈´s).McGinn (2004), pp. 157‚Äì159. Most Romans lived in apartments (insulae); the domus was a large, independent dwelling owned by a family of considerable means, and in Rome was central to the family's social identity. A few of these residences have rooms decorated with pornographic art\\"Pornographic\\" here means portrayals of ordinary human beings having sex, as distinguished from depictions of mythological rapes or aroused satyrs and Priapuses. not differing from that found in identified brothels; in some cases, an erotically decorated room has its own exterior door to admit visitorsMcGinn (2004), pp. 157‚Äì158, sites listed pp. 163‚Äì164. who would normally enter the home through the main doors leading to the atrium, where the family displayed ancestral images and other trophies of respectability. It has been suggestedMcGinn (2004), pp. 158‚Äì159. that these rooms were meant to evoke the ambience of a brothel for the hosting of exclusive sex parties, such as the one described by the historian Valerius Maximus as occurring in 52 BC with a consul and the tribunes of the plebs in attendance: > Just as notorious was that party arranged for Metellus Scipio when he was > consul and for the people's tribunes‚Äîby Gemellus, their tribunicial errand > boy. He was a free man by birth, but twisted by his business to play the > servant's role.

McGinn (2004), p. 159, goes so > far as to suggest that this party in particular helped make the Pompeian > \\"sex clubs\\" fashionable. The existence of sex clubs may provide background for Late Republican political smears about public figures whose party guests included prostitutes,Cicero makes accusations of this kind against Verres, Piso, and Antony, who is said to have converted his bedrooms into stabula, the cubicles housing prostitutes in a brothel, and his dining room into popinae, common eateries; see In Verrem 2.3.6, 2.4.83, 2.5.81‚Äì82, 137; Post Reditum in Senatu 11, 14; Philippicae 2.15, 62‚Äì63, 69, as cited by McGinn (2004), p. 163. and for the notorious Imperial whorehouse Caligula established on the Palatine, where he prostituted married women and freeborn youths.McGinn (2004), pp. 159, 162. Sex acts and positions Around 90 positions for intercourse are recorded in the ancient world.Paul G.P. Meyboom and Miguel John Versluys, \\"The Meaning of Dwarfs in Nilotic Scenes,\\" in Nile into Tiber: Egypt in the Roman World. Proceedings of the IIIrd International Conference of Isis Studies, Leiden, May 11‚Äì14, 2005 (Brill, 2007), p. 184. Both Roman erotic art and Latin literature, most famously a passage from Ovid's Art of Love,Ovid, Ars Amatoria 3.771ff. depict various forms of copulation (concubitus varii) and sexual positions (figurae veneris). The Latin terms are Ovid's, from his description of how the most aristocratic households displayed erotic paintings among their art collections.Ovid, Tristia 2.1.523Clarke, pp. 91‚Äì92. According to Suetonius, Tiberius had a vast collection of sex manuals and erotic art, including a painting of the mythological huntress Atalanta performing oral sex on Meleager, a work that the emperor regarded as worth more than a million sesterces. Sexual variety fascinated Romans. Astrology was thought to influence one's preferences and pursuits: people born when the sun, moon, and planets were in certain astrological signsCapricorn, Aquarius, Taurus or Cancer. were supposed to be inclined toward secret vice or \\"unnatural\\" forms of intercourse, or to becoming pathici.Firmicus Maternus 5.2.4, 5.3.11 and 17, 5.6.8, 6.30.15; Vettius Valens 1.1, 2.16, 2.36 and 38, as cited and summarized in Younger, p. 20. Lucretius observes that sex acts may have different purposes. Prostitutes employ certain movements aimed at giving their customers pleasure and at avoiding pregnancy. Wives wishing to conceive are advised against moving vigorously during intercourse, since such movements \\"knock the ploughshare from the furrow and misdirect the sowing of the seed\\".Lucretius, De rerum natura 4.1268‚Äì1273 Lucretius recommends \\"doggy style\\" (a tergo) for couples trying to conceive, because it mimics the natural procreative sex of animals.Lucretius, De rerum natura 4.1263‚Äì1267Brown, pp. 67‚Äì68. =Male‚Äìfemale sex= \\"woman riding\\" position was a favorite in Roman artFredrick, p. 159. The basic obscene verb for a man having sex with a woman is futuo, \\"I fuck.\\" Although not found in polite literature,The verb is not found, for instance, in the writings of Cicero; Adams, p. 118. Futuo appears mainly in graffiti (at least 65 instances) and the Priapea. Martial uses the verb 49 times. It is found seven times in Catullus, and once in the early work of Horace. Although Ausonius revives the general obscenity of Martial, he avoids the use of futuo. futuo was not necessarily insulting or aggressive; it was used transactionally for sex between a prostitute and her client, and in a passionate or loving setting may have been spoken as an arousing intimacy.Adams, pp. 120‚Äì121. A fragment from a play by Plautus suggests that acquiring an erotic vocabulary was part of a woman's introduction to sexuality within marriage: a virgin explains that she has not yet learned the words suitable for the wedding night (nupta verba).Plautus, frg. 68 in the edition of LindsayAdams, p. 121. The easy use of the word by a woman in other settings indicates her independence of social norms, and corresponding lack of status. \\"Either fuck me or let's fight it out,\\" the formidable Fulvia is quoted as challenging the future Augustus.Aut futue aut pugnemus, literally \\"either fuck or let's fight,\\" in Martial 11.20.7; Adams, p. 121. Augustus chooses to sound the call to battle. In graffiti at Pompeii written by both men and women, forms of futuo are used to announce prowess, satisfaction, or availability. Thomas Habinek has claimed that \\"Ovid invents the category of the heterosexual male\\", since, he says, it was considered normal for a Roman man to have same-sex relations.Habinek, p. 31. Ovid radically rejects the Roman tradition of pederasty, and says he takes more pleasure (voluptas) in making love with a woman as his equal. Sexual pleasure, he emphasizes, should be mutual,Ovid, Ars Amatoria 2.681‚Äì684: Women, he says, \\"need no encouragement to take their pleasure: let both man and woman feel what delights them equally. I hate embraces which fail to satisfy both partners. That is why for me loving boys holds little attraction\\" (Illis sentitur non inritata voluptas: / Quod iuvet, ex aequo femina virque ferant. / Odi concubitus, qui non utrumque resolvunt; / Hoc est, cur pueri tangar amore minus); Edwards, p. 7 and he advises men not to conclude the sex act without enabling their female partner to achieve orgasm. In one passage, he seems to be recommending simultaneous orgasm: > But don't you fail your lady, hoisting bigger sails, and don't let her get > ahead of you on the track either; race to the finish together: that's when > pleasure is full, when man and woman lie there, equally vanquished.Ovid, Ars > Amatoria 2.725‚Äì8, as cited in Potter (2009), p. 343. Mulier equitans \\"Riding\\" is a common metaphor for the sex act, particularly used of the woman-on-top position.Adams, p. 165. The mulier equitans (\\"woman riding\\") does not appear in Greek vase paintingThe position is discussed \\"in some detail\\" in Greek literature, and appears in other forms of Greek art; Fredrick, p. 159. but is popular in Roman art. Ovid recommends it for the petite woman, as a tall woman may not wish to seem too towering in relation to the man.Ovid, Ars Amatoria 3.777‚Äì778; Gibson, Ars Amatoria Book 3, p. 393. Supposedly favored by the mythological couple Hector and Andromache, even though she was of legendary height, it was jokingly called \\"the Hector horse\\".Hectoreus equus (Ars Amatoria 3.777‚Äì778); Meyboom and Versluys, \\"The Meaning of Dwarfs in Nilotic Scenes,\\" in Nile into Tiber, p. 188; Gibson, Ars Amatoria Book 3, p. 393. Trojan imagery, especially in connection with the Trojan horse, became important under the Julio-Claudian emperors, who claimed descent from the Trojan refugee Aeneas, son of Venus. See for instance the \\"Troy Game\\". One relief from Roman Gaul showing the mulier equitans plays on the metaphor by picturing a galloping horse within a frame in the background (see first image in gallery below).Clarke, p. 258. In art, the mulier equitans convention has the woman posed frontally to expose her body in full to the viewer, often emphasizing her depilated pubic area. The significance of this position in Roman culture has been interpreted variously. Kenneth Dover thought it might represent the relative sexual emancipation of Roman women.Kenneth Dover, Greek Homosexuality (Harvard University Press, 1978), p. 107, as cited by Fredrick, p. 159. From a woman's perspective, the position would grant an independence of movement for her own pleasure.Catherine Johns, Sex or Symbol? Erotic Images of Greece and Rome (Routledge, 1982), pp. 136‚Äì137, as cited in Fredrick, p. 159. Paul Veyne, however, thought it emphasized that the woman had to do the work of servicing the man, who lies there and receives pleasure without effort.Paul Veyne, \\"La famille et l'amour sous le haut-empire romain,\\" Annales: √âconomies, soci√©t√©s, civilisations 33 (1978) 53‚Äì54, as cited in Fredrick, p. 159. The position may have been favored for art because it pleased both male and female viewers: for men, it offered an unobstructed view of the woman's body, as recommended by Ovid, and of the penis entering the vagina; women saw the visually dominant female figure playing the active role.Fredrick, pp. 159‚Äì160. The position is also called Venus pendula conversa, \\"perpendicular Venus with the woman facing toward (the man)\\"; for its reverse (Venus pendula aversa, \\"perpendicular Venus with the woman facing away\\"), the man lies down with the woman on top, but she turns her back and faces his feet. This version is rarely mentioned or depicted, but is found in Roman art set in Nilotic Egypt.Meyboom and Versluys, \\"The Meaning of Dwarfs in Nilotic Scenes,\\" in Nile into Tiber, p. 188.

The object was usually but not always male. Pedicare was a blunt and non-euphemistic word, and can be used in a threatening manner, as notoriously by Catullus in Carmen 16, or in general to mean \\"fuck you\\".Adams, pp. 123‚Äì124 The etymology of pedicare is unclear, but some have thought it derived from Greek paidika, having to do with pederasty.Adams, p. 123. The basic word for \\"anus\\" was culus. Common metaphors are ficus, \\"fig\\", and anus, \\"ring,\\" which was considered a decorous term and was standard in medical texts.Adams, pp. 112‚Äì114. Men were said to \\"take it like a woman\\" (muliebria pati, \\"to undergo womanly things\\") when they were anally penetrated, but when a man performed anal sex on a woman, she was thought of as playing the boy's role.Hallett, p. 31. Martial, for instance, is emphatic that anal sex is better with boys than with women; when his wife objects that she provides him with anal sex in an effort to preserve his fidelity, he taunts her with the inferiority of her anus compared with a boy's.Martial 12.75 and 96, using the fig metaphor; Williams, p. 27Richlin (1983), pp. 41‚Äì42. The figura veneris in which the woman crouches to lift her buttocks, called \\"the lioness\\", may be intended for anal penetration, since boys in Greek art can be portrayed in the same position; with a female partner, it may be difficult to distinguish in art from a tergo (rear entry).\\"The lionness\\" as a name for the position was popularized by 4th-century BC Greeks; Clarke, pp. 26, 230. Culibonia (\\"good anal\\") was a humorous term for a prostitute with this speciality.Adams, pp. 110‚Äì111. Avoiding pregnancy may have been one motive for female prostitutes to offer anal intercourse.Clarke, p. 230. =Os impurum= Os impurum, \\"filthy mouth\\" or \\"impure mouth\\", was a term of abuse especially for those who provided oral sex.Valentina Arena, \\"Roman Oratorical Invective,\\" in A Companion to Roman Rhetoric (Blackwell, 2010), p. 156; Nancy Woman, Abusive Mouths in Classical Athens (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 322. \\"Oral turpitude\\"Woman, Abusive Mouths, p. 322. was a favorite form of invective for Catullus,Catullus, Carmina 39, 78b, 97, 99; William Fitzgerald, Catullan Provocations: Lyric Poetry and the Drama of Position (University of California Press, 1995, 1999), p. 262. Horace, and Martial. An accusation of having an os impurum is an \\"extreme obscenity\\",A Companion to Catullus (Blackwell, 2011), n.p. so vile that Cicero reserved it for men of lower standing than himself,Quintus Apronius, the assistant of Verres, at Verres 2.3; Sextus Cloelius, a henchman of Clodius Pulcher, at De domo sua 25, 26, 47‚Äì8, 83. only implying that their debasement tainted their more powerful patrons who were his real targets.Arena, \\"Roman Oratorical Invective,\\" p. 156. Wall painting from Pompeii depicting cunnilingus It was a convention of obscenely comic verse that oral sex caused bad breath that was nearly toxic.Richlin (1983), p. 27Guillermo Gal√°n Vioque, Martial, Book VII: A Commentary (Brill, 2002), p. 495. \\"Whores of the alleyways\\" are contaminated from giving oral sex; Catullus refers to \\"the foul saliva of a pissed-over whore\\".Catullus, Carmen 99.10 The urinary function of the penis makes oral sex particularly repulsive to Catullus, who elsewhere reviles a Celtiberian for brushing his teeth in urine.Richlin (1983), p. 150. Martial jokes that a fine perfume turned to garum, fish sauce, when it was sniffed by a man whose breath was putrid from oral sex.Martial, 7.94; Vioque, Martial, Book VII, p. 495. In another of Martial's epigrams, a fellator breathes on a hot cake to cool it down and turns it to excrement.Martial, 3.17; Guillermo Gal√°n Vioque, Martial, Book VII: A Commentary, p. 495. The bad breath and rotten teeth that are attributed to performing oral sex represent moral decay and a general corruption of the mouth's positive functions as the organ of a citizen's persuasive speech.Woman, Abusive Mouths, p. 322fRichlin (1983), p. 99Marilyn B. Skinner, Catullus in Verona: A Reading of the Elegiac Libellus, Poems 65‚Äì116 (Ohio State University Press, 2003), p. 79. Cunnilingus and fellatio Because of the stigma attached to providing physical pleasure, a man who performed oral sex on a woman was subject to mockery. Cunnilingus typically appears in Roman art only as part of a reciprocal act, with the woman fellating her male partner in some variation of the \\"69\\" position.Clarke, p. 224. A wall painting from Pompeii, however, represents a virtually unique role reversal in the giving of oral sex. The woman who receives cunnilingus is tall and shapely, well-groomed, and brazenly nude except for jewelry. The male figure is relatively small, crouching subserviently, and fully clothed; he has an anxious or furtive look.Clarke, p. 223 The situation is so extreme that it was probably meant to be humorous as well as titillating; other paintings in this group show a series of sex acts, at least some of which could be seen as transgressive or parodic.Clarke, pp. 224‚Äì227. There is some evidence that women could hire male prostitutes to provide cunnilingus. Graffiti at Pompeii advertise the prices male prostitutes charged for cunnilingus, in the same price range as females performing fellatio; however, the graffiti could be intended as insults to the men named, and not as actual advertisements.Clarke, p. 226. One graffito is perhaps intended as political invective: \\"Vote Isidore for aedile; he's the best at licking cunt!\\"CIL 4.1383, scrawled at an entrance to a shop in Pompeii; Antonio Varone, Erotica Pompeiana: Love Inscriptions on the Walls of Pompeii (¬´L'Erma¬ª di Bretschneider, 2002), p. 81. Woman fellating a man on an oil lamp The Latin verb fellare is usually used for a woman performing oral sex on a man. Accusing a man of fellating another man was possibly the worst insult in all Roman invective.Fredrick, p. 162. It was an act that might be requested from women who were infames,Catullus Carmina 58 and 59; and Martial, Epigrams 4.84, 9.4, 9.67, and 12.55, on women who perform fellatio. and not something a husband in a respectable household would have expected from his wife.Fredrick, p. 161. Fellatio was seen as a \\"somewhat laughable\\" preference for older men who have trouble maintaining an erection, but graffiti show that the skills of a good fellatrix were enthusiastically utilized.Fredrick, p. 163. Fellatio was a fairly uncommon subject in Roman art. Irrumatio Irrumatio is a forced form of fellatio, almost always against another man. Forcing someone to be a receptacle for oral sex was proof of virility, something to boast about, as indicated by the Priapeia and the poems of Catullus and Martial. It was also threatened as a punishment,Mostly famously in Catullus, Carmen 16 particularly for adulterers. Martial urges a wronged husband who has already cut off the adulterous man's ears and nose to complete the humiliation by befouling his mouth with oral rape.Martial, 2.47.4 =Group sex= Threesome (from Pompeii) arranged in the manner described by Catullus, poem 56Clarke, pp. 233‚Äì234. Group sex appears in literary sources, graffiti, and art.Clark, Looking at Lovemaking, pp. 233‚Äì234. Suetonius says that the emperor Tiberius enjoyed watching group sex, and described \\"chains\\" arranged of girls and boys: > In his retreat at Capri, he put together a bedroom that was the theater of > his secret debauches. There he assembled from all over companies of male and > female prostitutes, and inventors of monstrous couplings (which he called > spintriae), so that, intertwining themselves and forming a triple chain > (triplici serie connexi), they mutually prostituted themselves in front of > him to fire up his flagging desires.Suetonius, Life of Tiberius 43, as > quoted by Clarke, p. 234. Foursome from the Suburban Baths at Pompeii Most threesomes depict two men penetrating a woman. A medallion from Roman Gaul shows two men reclining on a bed, one on the right and one on the left, with their legs extended under a woman between them. Another shows a woman \\"riding\\" a man who reclines, while a man standing behind her parts her legs to enter. A far less common variation has one man entering a woman from the rear while he in turn receives anal sex from a man standing behind him, a scenario found in Catullus, Carmen 56 as well as art. Catullus makes it clear that this concatenation was considered humorous,Clarke, p. 234. possibly because the man in the center could be a cinaedus, a male who liked to receive anal sex but who was also considered seductive to women.Clarke, pp. 234‚Äì235. Foursomes also appear in Roman art, typically with two women and two men, sometimes in same-sex pairings. One example of a foursome from the Suburban Baths at Pompeii demonstrates what Romans saw as the superior role. A woman on the far right kneels beside a bed to perform cunnilingus on a woman lying on it; this woman in turn fellates a man who kneels above her. The man is himself receiving anal sex from a fourth figure, who is represented as the \\"victor\\": he acts only to fulfill his own sexual gratification without providing it to others, and looks directly at the viewer with a triumphant wave of the hand.Clarke, p. 255. A Latin epigram by the Gallo-Roman poet Ausonius (4th century AD) is a riddle that depends on familiarity with the configurations of group sex: > \\"Three men in bed together: two are committing debauchery (stuprum), two are > being debauched.\\" > \\"Doesn't that make four men?\\" > \\"You're mistaken: the man on either end each counts as a single offense, but > the one in the middle both acts and is acted on.\\"Ausonius, Epigram 43 Green > (39); Matthew Kuefler, The Manly Eunuch: Masculinity, Gender Ambiguity, and > Christian Ideology in Late Antiquity (University of Chicago Press, 2001), p. > 92. =Masturbation= Masturbation is little noted in the sources for Roman sexuality.Richlin, \\"Sexuality in the Roman Empire,\\" p. 351. Martial has a few mentions in his poems, but considers it an inferior form of sexual release resorted to by slaves, though he admits to masturbating when a beautiful slave-boy is too expensive to obtain: \\"my hand relieved me as a substitute for Ganymede\\".Martial, 2.43.14Williams, p. 270J.P. Sullivan, Martial, the Unexpected Classic: A Literary and Historical Study (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 190. Martial describes slaves masturbating behind the door as they watch Andromache ride Hector (11.104.13‚Äì14). Masturbation was a longstanding if infrequent theme in Latin satire; one of the few surviving fragments of Lucilius, Rome's earliest satirist, jokes about a personified penis (Mutto) whose girlfriend Laeva (\\"Lefty\\") wipes away his \\"tears\\".At laeva lacrimas muttoni absterget amica (\\"A girlfriend wipes away Mutto's tears‚Äîhis left hand, that is\\"): Lucilius 307 and 959. Kirk Freundenburg has dubbed the mutt≈ç of Lucilius \\"clearly the least finicky of all personified penises in Roman satire\\": Satires of Rome: Threatening Poses from Lucilius to Juvenal (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 205. The Romans preferred the left hand for masturbation.Antonio Varone, Erotica pompeiana: Love Inscriptions on the Walls of Pompeii (¬´L'Erma¬ª di Bretschneider, 2002), p. 95. A graffito from Pompeii reads \\"when my worries oppress my body, with my left hand I release my pent-up fluids\\".multa mihi curae cum [pr]esserit artus has ego mancinas, stagna refusa, dabo: CIL 4.2066, as cited by Younger, p. 108. The etymology of the Latin verb masturbari is vexed. It has been argued that it is a compound of turbare, \\"agitate\\", and mas, \\"male\\", in an otherwise unattested usage for \\"penis\\".Etymological views as summarized by Joshua T. Katz, \\"Testimonia Ritus Italici: Male Genitalia, Solemn Declarations, and a New Latin Sound Law,\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 98 (1998), pp. 210‚Äì213, citing Judith P. Hallett, \\"Masturbator, mascarpio\\", Glotta 54 (1976) 292‚Äì308, for turbare + mas, with support for this usage of mas from Douglas Q. Adams, \\"Latin mas and masturbari\\", Glotta 63 (1985) 241‚Äì247. One traditional view sees man(u)-, \\"hand,\\" with an altered form of stuprare, \\"to defile, commit a sexual wrong against\\".Adams, pp. 208‚Äì211. Calvert Watkins proposed that it derives from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning \\"marrow, brain\\", since ancient medical writers believed that semen descended from the brain through the bones;Calvert Watkins, How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics (Oxford University Press, 1995), p 533ff. if this is correct, the word turbare may still have influenced the formation in Latin.Katz, \\"Testimonia Ritus Italici,\\" p. 212. =Bestiality= Leda and the swan, with a Cupid in attendance (4th- century Roman relief) Leopard attacking a condemned person in the arena (Zliten mosaic, c. 200 AD) The mythological tradition is full of sexual encounters between humans and animals, especially mortal women and gods in the guise of animals. Bestiality is a particular characteristic of intercourse with Jupiter (Greek Zeus), who visits Leda as a swan and Europa as a bull. The Minotaur is born when Pasipha√´ feels such sexual attraction for a bull that she has herself disguised as a cow to mate with him. Satyrs, known for their sexual voracity, are often pictured with bestial features. Mock bestiality is recorded as a form of sexual roleplay in Imperial Rome. Nero is supposed to have enjoyed a form of bondage with either male or female partners in which he dressed in animal skins to attack their genitals, just as condemned prisoners were bound and attacked by wild animals in the arena (see Damnatio ad bestias).Suetonius, Life of Nero 29; Carlin A. Barton, The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster (Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 68. The historian Dio tells of how a prostitute pretended to be a leopard for the gratification of a senator.Cassius Dio 76.8.2; Barton, The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans, p. 68. The actor Bathyllus was known for an erotic dance in which he dressed as Leda having sex with the swan; the women watching were variously aroused.Juvenal, Satire 6.60ff.; Erik Gunderson, \\"The Libidinal Rhetoric of Satire,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Roman Satire (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 235; Blanshard, Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity, p. 40. Bestiality is also a theme of Apuleius' novel Metamorphoses (or The Golden Ass), in which the protagonist, transformed into a donkey, is desired by a wealthy noble matron, just as Pasipha√´ desired the bull.Apuleius, Metamorphoses 10.19‚Äì22; Barton, The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans, p. 68. There is some indication that violent sexual encounters, like other mythological scenarios, were acted out as punitive entertainments in the arena. The poet Martial praises a scenario for its fidelity to the Pasipha√´ myth.Martial, De spectaculis 5Paul Veyne, Foucault: His Thought, His Character (Polity Press, 2010, originally published 2008 in French), p. 9. The logistics of staging a sex act between a woman and a bull is a matter of speculation; if \\"Pasipha√´\\" were a condemned criminal to be tortured and killed, the animal may have been induced by the application of \\"vaginal secretion from a cow in season\\".Coleman, \\"Fatal Charades,\\" p. 64. In Apuleius's novel, a female poisoner condemned ad bestias is scheduled to appear in the arena for intercourse with the protagonist in his bestial form.Apuleius, Metamorphoses 10.29.34; Coleman, \\"Fatal Charades,\\" p. 64. Hermaphroditism and androgyny Hermaphroditus warding off a satyr (Pompeii, c. 45‚Äì79 AD) In his chapter on anthropology and human physiology in the encyclopedic Natural History, Pliny notes that \\"there are even those who are born of both sexes, whom we call hermaphrodites, at one time androgyni\\" (andr-, \\"man\\", and gyn-, \\"woman\\", from the Greek).Pliny, Natural History 7.34: gignuntur et utriusque sexus quos hermaphroditos vocamus, olim androgynos vocatos The Sicilian historian Diodorus (1st century BC) wrote that \\"there are some who declare that the coming into being of creatures of a kind such as these are marvels (terata), and being born rarely, they announce the future, sometimes for evil and sometimes for good\\".Diodorus Siculus 4.6.5; Will Roscoe, \\"Priests of the Goddess: Gender Transgression in Ancient Religion,\\" in History of Religions 35.3 (1996), p. 204. Isidore of Seville (c. 560‚Äì636) described a hermaphrodite fancifully as those who \\"have the right breast of a man and the left of a woman, and after coitus in turn can both sire and bear children\\".Isidore of Seville, Eytmologiae 11.3. 11. In contemporary English, \\"hermaphrodite\\" is used in biology but has acquired pejorative connotations in referring to people born with physical characteristics of both sexes (see intersex); in antiquity, however, the figure of the so-called hermaphrodite was a primary focus of questions pertaining to gender identity.Clarke, p. 49Taylor, p. 78. The hermaphrodite represented a \\"violation of social boundaries, especially those as fundamental to daily life as male and female\\".Roscoe, \\"Priests of the Goddess,\\" p. 204. In traditional Roman religion, a hermaphroditic birth was a kind of prodigium, an occurrence that signalled a disturbance of the pax deorum, Rome's treaty with the gods, as Diodorus indicated.Veit Rosenberger, \\"Republican nobiles: Controlling the Res Publica,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 295. Livy records an incident during the Second Punic War when the discovery of a four-year-old hermaphrodite prompted an elaborate series of expiations: on the advice of the haruspices, the child was enclosed in a chest, carried out to sea, and allowed to drown.Livy 27.11 (using the term androgynus); Rosenberger, \\"Republican nobiles,\\" p. 297. Other rituals followed. A hermaphrodite found in 133 BC was drowned in the local river; committing the hermaphroditic person to the element of water seems to have been the prescribed way to repair the perceived violation of the natural order.Julius Obsequens 27a (androgynus); Rosenberger, \\"Republican nobiles,\\" p. 298. Pliny observed that while hermaphrodites were once considered portents (prodigia), in his day they had become objects of delight (deliciae); they were among the human curiosities of the sort that the wealthy might acquire at the \\"monsters' market\\" at Rome described by Plutarch.Plutarch, Moralia 520c; Dasen, \\"Multiple Births in Graeco-Roman Antiquity,\\" p. 61. Under Roman law, a hermaphrodite had to be classed as either male or female; no third gender existed as a legal category.Lynn E. Roller, \\"The Ideology of the Eunuch Priest,\\" Gender & History 9.3 (1997), p. 558. In the mythological tradition, Hermaphroditus was a beautiful youth who was the son of Hermes (Roman Mercury) and Aphrodite (Venus).Ovid, Metamorphoses 4.287‚Äì88. Like many other divinities and heroes, he had been nursed by nymphs, but the evidence that he himself received cult devotion among the Greeks is sparse. Ovid wrote the most influential narrativeTaylor, p. 77Clarke, p. 49. of how Hermaphroditus became androgynous, emphasizing that although the handsome youth was on the cusp of sexual adulthood, he rejected love as Narcissus had, and likewise at the site of a reflective pool.Taylor, p. 78ff. There the water nymph Salmacis saw and desired him. He spurned her, and she pretended to withdraw until, thinking himself alone, he undressed to bathe in her waters. She then flung herself upon him, and prayed that they might never be parted. The gods granted this request, and thereafter the body of Hermaphroditus contained both male and female. As a result, men who drank from the waters of the spring Salmacis supposedly \\"grew soft with the vice of impudicitia\\", according to the lexicographer Festus.Paulus ex Festo 439LRichlin (1993), p. 549. The myth of Hylas, the young companion of Hercules who was abducted by water nymphs, shares with Hermaphroditus and Narcissus the theme of the dangers that face the beautiful adolescent male as he transitions to adult masculinity, with varying outcomes for each.Taylor, p. 216, note 46. Depictions of Hermaphroditus were very popular among the Romans. The dramatic situation in paintings often elicits a \\"double take\\" on the part of the viewer, or expresses the theme of sexual frustration.Clarke, p. 50. Hermaphroditus is often in the company of a satyr, a figure of bestial sexuality known for subjecting an unsuspecting or often sleeping victim to non-consensual sex; the satyr in scenes with Hermaphroditus is usually shown to be surprised or repulsed, to humorous effect. In a few works, Hermaphroditus is strong enough to ward off his would-be attacker, but in others he shows his willingness to engage in sex, even if the satyr seems no longer inclined:Clarke, pp. 50‚Äì55. > Artistic representations of Hermaphroditus bring to the fore the ambiguities > in sexual differences between women and men as well as the ambiguities in > all sexual acts. ... Hermaphroditus gives an eternally ambiguous answer to a > man's curiosity about a woman's sexual experience‚Äîand vice versa. ... > (A)rtists always treat Hermaphroditus in terms of the viewer finding out > his/her actual sexual identity. ... Hermaphroditus stands for both the > physical and, more important, the psychological impossibility of ever > understanding the feelings of the beloved. Hermaphroditus is a highly > sophisticated representation, invading the boundaries between the sexes that > seem so clear in classical thought and representation.Clarke, pp. 54‚Äì55. Macrobius describes a masculine form of \\"Venus\\" (Aphrodite) who received cult on Cyprus; she had a beard and male genitals, but wore women's clothing. The deity's worshippers cross-dressed, men wearing women's clothes, and women men's.Macrobius, Saturnalia 3.8.2. Macrobius says that Aristophanes called this figure Aphroditos. The Latin poet Laevius wrote of worshipping \\"nurturing Venus\\" whether female or male (sive femina sive mas).Venerem igitur almum adorans, sive femina sive mas est, as quoted by Macrobius, Saturnalia 3.8.3. The figure was sometimes called Aphroditos. In several surviving examples of Greek and Roman sculpture, she is found in the attitude anasyrmene, from the Greek verb anasyromai, \\"to pull up one's clothes\\".Penner, p. 22. The love goddess lifts her garments to reveal her masculine attribute, male genitalia, a gesture that traditionally held apotropaic or magical power.Dominic Montserrat, \\"Reading Gender in the Roman World,\\" in Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity, and Power in the Roman Empire (Routledge, 2000), pp. 172‚Äì173. Sexual conquest and imperialism Sestertius of Vespasian depicting \\"Captive Judaea\\" In 55 BC, Pompeius Magnus (\\"Pompey the Great\\") opened his theater complex dedicated to Venus Victrix, \\"Venus the Conqueror,\\" which continued into late antiquity as a venue for performing arts, literature, landscape design, visual art, and architecture.Kuttner, p. 343. The Theater of Pompey was in many ways the permanent monument of his military triumph six years earlier. Among the displays were portrait galleries of female writers and of courtesans; a series of images illustrated freakish births that had served as war omens. In general, intellectuality and culture are represented as feminine and Hellenized, while war and politics are Roman and masculine.Kuttner, pp. 348‚Äì349. The birth omens are described by Pliny, Natural History 7.34, and other sources. Statues personified fourteen conquered nationes (\\"nations, peoples\\") as women in ethnic or \\"barbarian\\" dress.Kuttner, pp. 354‚Äì346Penner, pp. 122, 145. Other monuments throughout the Empire, including the Sebasteion at Aphrodisias and the altar of the Sanctuary of the Three Gauls at Lugdunum (modern Lyon, France), as well as various coins, embody conquered territories and peoples as women: Roman military power defeats a \\"feminized\\" nation.Penner, p. 134Potter (2009), p. 353Duncan Fishwick, \\"The Sixty Gallic Tribes and the Altar of the Three Gauls,\\" Historia 38.1 (1989) 111‚Äì112, thinks the 60 Gallic civitates at Lugdunum were represented by inscriptions rather than sculpture. Although the figures from Pompey's theater have not survived, relief panels from Aphrodisias include scenes such as a heroically nude Claudius forcing the submission of Britannia, whose right breast is bare, and Nero dragging away a dead Armenia, a composition that recalls the defeat of the Amazon Penthesilea by Achilles.Penner, pp. 135‚Äì138. A particularly well-documented series of coins depicts Iudaea Capta, a female personification of the Jewish nation as captive, issued after the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 70 AD.Penner, p. 121. Sexual conquest is a metaphor widely used by the Romans for imperialism, but not always straightforwardly for Roman domination. Horace famously described the Romans as taken captive by captive Greece: the image of Roman culture colonized from within by a civilization they had defeated but perceived as intellectually and aesthetically superior might be expressed by myths in which a man raped, abducted, or enslaved a woman but fell in love with her, as embodied for instance by Achilles and Briseis.Alessandro Barchiesi, \\"Roman Perspectives on the Greeks\\", in The Oxford Handbook of Hellenic Studies (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 104.

Pair- bonding is a term coined in the 1940s that is frequently used in sociobiology and evolutionary biology circles. The term often implies either a lifelong socially monogamous relationship or a stage of mating interaction in socially monogamous species. It is sometimes used in reference to human relationships. Monogamous voles (such as prairie voles) have significantly greater density and distribution of vasopressin receptors in their brain when compared to polygamous voles. These differences are located in the ventral forebrain and the dopamine-mediated reward pathway. Peptide arginine vasopressin (AVP), dopamine, and oxytocin act in this region to coordinate rewarding activities such as mating, and regulate selective affiliation. These species-specific differences have shown to correlate with social behaviors, and in monogamous prairie voles are important for facilitation of pair bonding. When compared to montane voles, which are polygamous, monogamous prairie voles appear to have more of these AVP and oxytocin neurotransmitter receptors. It is important that these receptors are in the reward centers of the brain because that could lead to a conditioned partner preference in the prairie vole compared to the montane vole which would explain why the prairie vole forms pair bonds and the montane vole does not. Varieties Black-backed jackals are one of very few monogamous mammals. This pair works together in teamwork to hunt down prey and scavenge. They will stay together until one of the two dies. According to evolutionary psychologists David P. Barash and Judith Lipton, from their 2001 book The Myth of Monogamy, there are several varieties of pair bonds: *Short- term pair-bond: a transient mating or associations *Long-term pair-bond: bonded for a significant portion of the life cycle of that pair *Lifelong pair-bond: mated for life *Social pair-bond: attachments for territorial or social reasons, as in cuckold situations *Clandestine pair-bond: quick extra- pair copulations *Dynamic pair-bond: e.g. gibbon mating systems being analogous to \\"swingers\\" Humans and pair bonding Pair-bonded human male and female Humans can experience some or all of the above-mentioned varieties of pair bonds in their lifetime. These bonds can be temporary or last a lifetime, same age or with different age groups. In a biological sense there are two main types of pair bonds exhibited in humans: social pair bonding and sexual pair bonding. The social pair bond is a strong behavioral and psychological relationship between two individuals that is measurably different in physiological and emotional terms from general friendships or other acquaintance relationships. On the other hand, the sexual pair bond is a behavioral and physiological bond between two individuals with a strong sexual attraction component. In this bond the participants in the sexual pair bond prefer to have sex with each other over other options. Social pair bonds are usually more wide-ranging than their sexual counterparts due to the sexual nature involved in the latter. In humans and other mammals, these pair bonds are created by a combination of social interaction and biological factors including neurotransmitters like oxytocin, vasopressin, and dopamine. Pair bonds (social and/or sexual) are a biological phenomenon and are not equivalent to the human social institution of marriage. Marriage can be associated with a sexual or social pair bond; however, married couples do not necessarily have to experience both or either of these bonds. Marriage can be a consequence of pair bonding and vice versa; however, neither always creates or leads to the other. Pair bonding in humans helps explain extreme \\"bonds\\" that we may share with others but are unable to articulate in terms of contemporary \\"love\\". Examples=Birds= Close to ninety percent of known avian species are monogamous, compared to five percent of known mammalian species. The majority of monogamous avians form long-term pair bonds which typically result in seasonal mating: these species breed with a single partner, raise their young, and then pair up with a new mate to repeat the cycle during the next season. Some avians such as swans, bald eagles, California condors, and the Atlantic Puffin are not only monogamous, but also form lifelong pair bonds. When discussing the social life of the bank swallow, Lipton and Barash state: > For about four days immediately prior to egg-laying, when copulations lead > to fertilization, the male bank swallow is very busy, attentively guarding > his female. Before this time, as well as after‚Äîthat is, when her eggs are > not ripe, and again after his genes are safely tucked away inside the > shells‚Äîhe goes seeking extra-pair copulations with the mates of other > males‚Ä¶who, of course, are busy with defensive mate-guarding of their own. mallard ducks form seasonal monogamous pairs. In various species, males provide parental care and females mate with multiple males. For example, recent studies show that extra-pair copulation frequently occurs in monogamous birds in which a \\"social\\" father provides intensive care for its \\"social\\" offspring. =Fishes= A University of Florida scientist reports that male sand gobies work harder at building nests and taking care of eggs when females are present ‚Äì the first time such ‚Äúcourtship parental care‚Äù has been documented in any species. In the cichlid species Tropheus moorii, a male and female will form a temporary monogamous pair bond and spawn; after which, the female leaves to mouthbrood the eggs on her own. T. moorii broods exhibit genetic monogamy (all eggs in a brood are fertilized by a single male). Another mouth brooding cichlid - the Lake Tanganyika cichlid (Xenotilapia rotundiventralis) has been shown that mating pairs maintain pair bonds at least until the shift of young from female to male. More recently the Australian Murray cod has been seen maintaining pair bonds over 3 years =Mammals= As noted above, different species of voles vary in their sexual behavior, and these differences correlate with expression levels of vasopressin receptors in reward areas of the brain. Scientists were able to change adult male montane voles' behavior to resemble that of monogamous prairie voles in experiments in which vasopressin receptors were introduced into the brain of male montane voles.

According to her author profile, she is a spokesperson \\"on consciousness, the new physics, and the practices of conventional and alternative medicine.\\" McTaggart is anti-vaccinationist. She promotes this belief in her book What Doctors Don't Tell You and in other publications. This has drawn significant criticism of her work and has created controversy. Her ideas are widely criticized as pseudoscience. Career In her autobiography McTaggart reports that after recovering from an illness using alternative medical approaches her husband suggested she start a newsletter on the risks of some medical practices and devised the title: \\"What Doctors Don't Tell You\\". In 1996 McTaggart published the book with the same name. She and her husband set up a public company in 2001, What Doctors Don't Tell You plc, later Conatus plc, which published newsletters, magazines and audio-tapes based on conferences and seminars including, What Doctors Don't Tell You, PROOF!, and Living the Field. This company was wound up in 2009. A new company, Wddty Publishing Ltd, run by McTaggart and her husband, took over the What Doctors Don't Tell You website, and New Age Publishing Ltd for McTaggart's other publishing and public-speaking activities. Publication of their monthly magazine What Doctors Don't Tell You restarted in August 2012, in a glossy format aimed at newsagent and high-street distribution, instead of using the previous subscription model, and carrying paid advertising, something McTaggart had originally said WDDTY would not do. In her book The Field, McTaggart asserts that the universe is unified by an interactive field. The book has been translated into fourteen languages. In a later book, The Intention Experiment, she discusses research in the field of human consciousness which she says supports the theory that \\"the universe is connected by a vast quantum energy field\\" and can be influenced by thought. Michael Shermer states that this belief is contradicted by conflicting evidence (e.g. studies on intercessory prayer). McTaggart has a personal- development program called \\"Living The Field\\" which is based on an idiosyncratic interpretation of the zero point field as applied to quantum mechanics. She appears in the extended version of the movie What the Bleep Do We Know!?, (2004). From 1996 until 2002 McTaggart and her husband Bryan Hubbard published the monthly newsletter Mother Knows Best, later renamed Natural Parent magazine, focusing on home schooling, environmental and health concerns, including nutrition and homeopathy. They also published related books: My Learning Child, My Spiritual Child and My Healthy Child. Significant portions of her book about Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington appeared without attributionCompare: or permission in The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys: An American Saga (1987), by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. Goodwin eventually resolved the matter with a public apology to McTaggart and a \\"substantial\\" monetary settlement. Bo Crader, \\"A Historian and Her Sources,\\" The Weekly Standard, January 28, 2002 Jill Lawless, \\"Author Says Doris Kearns Goodwin Took 'Heart and Guts' From Her Book,\\" Associated Press, March 23, 2002. Criticism What Doctors Don't Tell You has been cited for factual errors in its attacks on medicine, such as confusing the antiviral drug Tamiflu for a vaccine and attributing deaths to a nonexistent avian influenza vaccine. Ben Goldacre has described McTaggart as \\"viciously, viciously anti- vaccine\\" and notes that \\"In a radical move, even for the vaccine fear- mongering community, this time she has people dying from a vaccine that doesn‚Äôt actually exist\\". The Field has been characterized by Mark Henderson of The Times as pseudoscience, focusing on her personal understanding of quantum physics as a misconception. McTaggart was reported to have threatened to sue Simon Singh after he contacted Comag, the distributors of WDDTY, complaining that the magazine was \\"largely unscientific\\" and \\"promoting advice that could potentially harm readers.\\" \\"Also, many of the adverts appear to make pseudoscientific and unsubstantiated claims,\\" he said. \\"I even offered to meet with Comag and introduce them to medical experts, but they have not accepted this invitation. When I suggested that I would blog about our email exchange, their reaction was to tell me in no uncertain terms: 'I should inform you that we have sought legal advice in respect of this matter. We would take any attempts to damage our reputation on social media or elsewhere very seriously.'\\" In the months between first publication of What Doctors Don't Tell You in magazine form, and February 2013, 54 breaches of the Code of Advertising Practice in 11 adverts were adjudicated and upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority along with a further 11 informally resolved cases, concerning adverts in the first two issues,WDDTY #9 - Taking Stock, Nightingale Collaboration, 27 Feb 2013 with more breaches in subsequent issues too.Stemming the tide: 'The list of misleading adverts in the magazine What Doctors Don't Tell You sometimes seems endless...' nightingale- collaboration.org, accessed 2 July 2018 In an interview on BBC Radio 4, GP and author Dr. Margaret McCartney stated: \\"I'm astounded that Lynne thinks this is an evidence-based publication. It's anything but,\\" she said. \\"The problem with evidence is that it can tell you things that you'd rather not know. A lot of the time medicine does do harm but that's why doctors and scientists are duty- bound to put their research findings out there and to stop doing things that cause harm. What we shouldn't do is abandon medicine and the scientific method and go straight for alternative medicine with no good evidence that that works either.\\" She criticised stories in the magazine as \\"absolute rubbish\\" and \\"ridiculously alarmist\\". In an article in The Times in October 2013 Tom Whipple, science correspondent, said that \\"Experts are calling on high street shops to stop selling a magazine that claims that vitamin C cures HIV, suggests homeopathy could treat cancer and implies that the cervical cancer vaccine has killed hundreds of girls.\\" Personal life McTaggart is married to publisher Bryan Hubbard and lives in London with her two daughters.

Voluntary memory, its binary opposite, is characterized by a deliberate effort to recall the past. A famous example of involuntary memory is when Marcel Proust is reminded of his childhood by the taste of a madeleine cake dunked in tea in his book In Search of Lost Time. Occurrences There appear to be at least three different contexts within which involuntary memory arises, as described by J.H. Mace in his book Involuntary Memory. These include those that occur in everyday life, those that occur during the processes of voluntary and involuntary recall, and those that occur as part of a psychiatric syndrome. = Precious fragments = These include involuntary memories as they arise in everyday mental functioning, comprising the most common occurrences. They are characterized by their element of surprise, as they appear to come into conscious awareness spontaneously. They are the products of common every-day experiences such as eating a piece of cake, bringing to mind a past experience evoked by the taste. Research suggests that such experiences are especially strong and frequent in relation to one's sense of smell. The term \\"precious fragments\\" was coined by Marigold Linton, a pioneer in the study of autobiographical memory research. This is reflected, for example, in Proust‚Äôs experience of remembering, upon dunking a madeleine cookie in his tea in adulthood, a memory from childhood that occurred while eating madeleine cookies dunked in tea. = By-products of other memories = These are less common, and appear to be the result of voluntary/involuntary retrieval. Characteristic of such occurrences is the triggering effect this has, as one involuntary memory leads to another and so on. Again, Linton describes her own experiences with such memories as \\"coming unbidden sometimes when my mind is silent, but also as by-products of searches for other information.\\" Mace terms these ‚Äúinvoluntary memory chains,‚Äù stating that they are the product of spreading activation in the autobiographical memory system. These involuntary retrievals are experienced when activations are strong or relevant enough to current cognitive activity that they come into consciousness. According to Mace, this suggests that autobiographical memories are organized primarily conceptually (‚Äúexperiential type concepts: people, places, locations, activities, etc.‚Äù), while temporal associations are not retained over time the same way. = Not so precious fragments = Finally, some involuntary memories arise from traumatic experiences, and as such are fairly rare compared to other involuntary memories. Subjects describe them as salient, repetitive memories of traumatic events. The troubling nature of such memories makes these occurrences important to clinical researchers in their studies of psychiatric syndromes such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Some researchers have found that involuntary memories tend to have more emotional intensity and less centrality to life story than voluntary memories do. However, one study also shows that recurrent involuntary memories post-trauma can be explained with the general mechanisms of autobiographical memory, and tend to not come up in a fixed, unchangeable form. This suggests that psychologists may be able to develop ways to help individuals deal with traumatic involuntary memories. = Implications for Dementia Patients = Further research on the automatic nature of involuntary retrieval suggests that they may not require working memory input. Thus, one report hypothesizes that dementia patients may still have available precious autobiographical memories that remain inaccessible until ‚Äúsuitable triggers release them,‚Äù prodding at the possibility for caregivers to be trained to reactivate these memories to elicit positive emotional effects and maintain patients‚Äô life stories and sense of identity. Further empirical research is needed, but this insight starts a hopeful path into improving dementia care. History=Hermann Ebbinghaus= Herman Ebbinghaus (1850-1909). Born in Bremen, Germany in 1850, Hermann Ebbinghaus is recognized as the first to apply the principles of experimental psychology to studying memory. He is especially well known for his introduction and application of nonsense syllables in studying memory, study of which led him to discover the forgetting curve and the spacing effect, two of his most well- known contributions to the field. Ebbinghaus was also the first to attempt a description of involuntary memory, stating that, \\"often, even after years, mental states once present in consciousness return to it with apparent spontaneity and without any act of the will; that is, they are reproduced involuntarily.\\"Ebbinghaus, H. (1885/1964). Memory: A contribution to experimental psychology, (trans. H.A. Ruger and C.E. Bussenius). Dover, New York. He goes on to explain that these mental states were once experienced, rendering, by definition, their future spontaneous appearance into consciousness the act of remembering, though we may not always be aware of where or how we experienced this information the first time. Ebbinghaus also made the key note that these involuntary reproductions are not random or accidental; instead, \\"they are brought about through the instrumentality of other immediately present mental images,\\" under the laws of association. This reflects congruence with Mace‚Äôs and Linton‚Äôs theory of involuntary memories as by-products of other memories, as discussed above. =Marcel Proust‚ÄîProustian Memory= Proust in 1900 Marcel Proust was the first person to coin the term involuntary memory, in his novel √Ä la Recherche du Temps Perdu (In Search of Lost Time or Remembrance of Things Past). Proust did not have any psychological background, and worked primarily as a writer.Bernstein, A. E. (2005). The contributions of Marcel Proust to psychoanalysis. Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry, 33(1), 137‚Äì48. Proust viewed involuntary memory as containing the \\"essence of the past,\\" claiming that it was lacking from voluntary memory. In his novel, he describes an incident where he was eating tea soaked cake, and a childhood memory of eating tea soaked cake with his aunt was \\"revealed\\" to him. From this memory, he then proceeded to be reminded of the childhood home he was in, and even the town itself. This becomes a theme throughout In Search of Lost Time, with sensations reminding Proust of previous experiences. He dubbed these \\"involuntary memories\\". Current research=Chaining= One idea that has recently become the subject of studies on involuntary memory is chaining. This is the concept that involuntary memories have the tendency to trigger other involuntary memories that are related. Typically, it is thought to be the contents of involuntary memories that are related to one another, thereby causing the chaining effect. In a diary study done by J.H Mace, participants reported that frequently, when one involuntary memory arose, it would quickly trigger a series of other involuntary memories. This was recognized as the cueing source for involuntary memories. In work by Bernsten, the diary method was also applied to the study of involuntary memory chaining. The main hypothesis was that chaining would also occur on autobiographical memory tasks. Participants were asked to report the presence of involuntary memories while performing an autobiographical memory task. Results showed that participants did experience involuntary memory recall when they were recalling the past deliberately (also known as voluntary memory). This implies that involuntary memory production occurs as a product of chaining from voluntary memory‚Äîdeliberate recall of the past. =Priming= A common question in the study of involuntary memory is related to priming; what is it that activates such a memory? Various studies have been conducted in recent years to observe the conditions under which involuntary memories are primed. Mace, in one of his recent studies, wanted to test the notion that basic cognitive activities, such as thinking about the past, may prime involuntary memories. To test this idea, Mace set up a diary method study in which participants recorded involuntary memories they experienced during a two-week period, in a diary. During this two-week period, participants also had to come into a laboratory at intervals, and were instructed to recall memories from certain life periods (e.g., high school, first five years of marriage). Following this, comparing their involuntary memories to a control condition found that a significant number of their involuntary memories related to the time period they were instructed to recall. Such findings suggest that involuntary memories may be primed by even the simplest of cognitive tasks‚Äînamely, reminiscing and recalling the past. Neurological basis The hippocampus is important for the successful retrieval of involuntary memories. Research studies regarding the neurological functions of involuntary memory have been few in number. Thus far, only two neuroimaging studies have been conducted comparing involuntary memories to voluntary memories using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The first study found that while involuntary memory retrieval is mediated by the hippocampus, a structure of the brain known to be associated with successful episodic memory retrieval, involvement of the hippocampus was independent of whether or not remembering was intentional. The researchers believe this suggests that involuntary memories may reflect the ‚Äúrelative automaticity‚Äù of hippocampally-mediated retrieval. However, their research mainly focuses on identifying areas and functions involved in intentional retrieval. Activity in the medial/lateral parietal and right prefrontal cortex was insensitive to depth of encoding, but rather, varied depending on the intentionality of retrieval. These areas were increasingly engaged during intentional retrieval, suggesting that one function of this region may be to align remembering to aid with current behavioral goals.Rugg, M. D., Fletcher, P. C., Frith, C. D., J, R. S., & Dolan, R. J. (1997). Brain regions supporting intentional and incidental memory: a PET study. NeuroReport (Oxford), 8 (5), 1283-1287. This is distinct from involuntary memory, where individuals do not consciously retrieve memories that will be most helpful to their current situation; however, it remains unclear if this process is unconsciously undertaken by the brain. When dealing with involuntary word recognition tasks, activity in areas such as the left inferior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left hippocampus, and right superior occipital cortex have all been implicated. Yet, areas and structures that are uniquely associated with involuntary memory remain unclear and more research is needed to understand the cognitive and neurological basis of this memory phenomenon. The second study found that the medial temporal lobe, the posterior cingulate gyrus, and the precuneus, are activated during retrieval success with or without executive control seen within the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This implies that involuntary memories are successfully retrieved using the same system as voluntary memory when retrieving perceptual information. This is significant because it suggests that voluntary and involuntary retrieval are largely not mediated by separate cortical networks, which begs the question for future research of what distinguishes the two sub-components of memory, if not cognitive pathways and brain activation areas. Further, it might be explored whether these similarities in cognitive mechanism reflect shared properties and impacts of the recalled memories themselves, regardless of intentionality of retrieval. In this particular study, voluntary and involuntary recall were both associated with increased activations in the posterior cingulated gyrus, left precuneus, and right parahippocampal gyrus. In addition, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left precuneus were more active during voluntary recall, while left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was more active during involuntary recall. It is suggested that the activation seen in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during involuntary memory recall reflects the attempt to prevent the recollected material from interfering with the semantic judgment task.Hall, N. M., Gjedde, A., & Kupers, R. (2008). Neural mechanisms of voluntary and involuntary recall : A PET study. Behavioural brain research, 186 (2), 261-272. Effects of age=Development= While age plays a role in memory capabilities, it has been found that general strategies used to encode (to remember) memories is more important.Sophian, C., & Hagen, J. W. (1978). Involuntary memory and the development of retrieval skills in young children. Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 26 (3), 458‚Äì471. Those that are better at memorizing information are more likely to have more involuntary memories. In younger children (ages 10 and under), it has also been found that inducing involuntary memory during testing produced significantly better results than using voluntary memory.Roberts, T. A. (1989). Developmental aspects of activating voluntary and involuntary memory processes during reading. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 14 (1), 1‚Äì11. This can be accomplished by posing a vague, mildly related question or sentence prior to the actual test question. In older children (aged 14 and above), the opposite holds, with strictly voluntary memory leading to better test results. =Reminiscence bump= The reminiscence bump is the phenomenon where in memories formed during adolescence and early adulthood are more commonly remembered than those throughout other periods in life. This is due to the formation of self-identityConway, M. A., Wang, Q., Hanyu, K., & Haque, S. (2005). A cross-cultural investigation of autobiographical memory. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 36, 739‚Äì749. or the development of cognitive abilities across the lifespan.Rubin, D. C., Rahhal, T. A., & Poon, L. W. (1998). Things learned in early adulthood are remembered best. Memory & Cognition, 26, 3-19. Janssen, S. M. J., Kristo, G., Rouw, R., & Murre, J. M. J. (2015). The relation between verbal and visuospatial memory and autobiographical memory. Consciousness and Cognition, 31, 12-23. It has been found that this is true for both voluntary and involuntary memories.Schlagman, S., Kliegel, M., Schulz, J., & Kvavilashvili, L. (2009). Differential effects of age on involuntary and voluntary autobiographical memory. Psychology and Aging, 24(2), 397‚Äì411. Age has been found to have a difference on the amount of memories recalled, but no age differences were found in the specificity of involuntary memories. The role of emotion=Emotion intensity= Emotion plays a strong role in relation to memory. It has been found that memories associated with stronger emotions (e.g.: being happy at your wedding) are more easily remembered and quickly recalled,D'Argembeau, A., & Van der Linden, M. (2005). Influence of emotion on memory for temporal information. Emotion, 5(4), 503‚Äì507. as are those formed during moments of intense stress.Hall, N. M., & Berntsen, D. (2008). The effect of emotional stress on involuntary and voluntary conscious memories. Memory, 16(1), 48‚Äì57. The same holds true for involuntary memories, with happy involuntary memories occurring twice as often as unhappy or neutral involuntary memories.Berntsen, D., & Rubin, D. C. (2002). Emotionally charged autobiographical memories across the life span: The recall of happy, sad, traumatic and involuntary memories. Psychology and Aging, 17 (4), 636‚Äì652. In clinical disorders=Posttraumatic stress disorder= Often people who have been the victims of some type of trauma describe vivid memories that intrude on their thoughts spontaneously and without warning. Such mental intrusions, if maintained over time compose the hallmark symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Berntsen, D., & Rubin, D. C. (2008). The reappearance hypothesis revisited: Recurrent involuntary memories after traumatic events and in everyday life. Memory & Cognition (pre-2012), 36 (2), 449-60. The DSM-IV defines a trauma as an event in which someone experiences, or witnesses' severe injury to themselves or others or a threat to their integrity. The person must also have responded with fear, helplessness or horror at the time of the trauma. The main psychological consequences of this include re-experiencing the traumatic event (through both intrusive thoughts and images), avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, and increased arousal levels. When it comes to involuntary memory, researchers are mainly interested in the concept of these trauma-related intrusions, which generally involved some form of re-experiencing the event, including a sensory component (e.g., imagery in any modality be it visual, auditory etc.). These intrusions, often termed \\"flashbacks\\", make the victim feel as though they are reliving the trauma, and cause high levels of emotional arousal, and the sense of an impending threat. Typically, they are parts of the traumatic event that were most salient at the time, known as \\"hotspots\\" and have the definitive feature that they cause high levels of emotional distress, and may be difficult to recall deliberately. Although this is a defining feature of PTSD, intrusive memories are also frequently encountered in anxiety-based disorders, psychotic disorders and even within the general population. Regardless of the context in which they are encountered, intrusions tend to have the same central feature; that the stored information is being recalled involuntarily. It is thought that intrusions arise when an individual encounters stimuli similar to the stimuli that were processed and stored during the trauma, thus triggering the memory into the conscious mind. A common example is one in which someone who has the victim of a car crash, upon hearing the screeching of tires experiences a flashback of their own collision, as if they are back at the original event. =Psychosis= Stressful and traumatic events, which may manifest as involuntary memories called flashbacks, may trigger a wide range of anxiety- based and psychotic disorders.

Occurrence of imagery and its link with early memories in agoraphobia. Memory, 12, 416‚Äì427 are a few examples of disorders that have influences from flashbacks. Psychosis is defined as a range of perceptual presentations, with the associated symptoms frequently referred to as either positive or negative. Positive symptoms are delusional, and may include hallucinations, while negative symptoms are characterized by a \\"lack\\" of functioning, which may include a lack of affect (emotional feeling) and loss of motivation. One study found that there was a high prevalence of trauma in patients with severe mental illness.Mueser, K. T., Trumbettam S. L., Rosenberg, S. D., Vivader, R., Goodman, L. B., Osher, F. C., Auciello, P., & Foy, D. W. (1998). Trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder in severe mental illness. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 66, 493‚Äì499. However, only a small percentage had been diagnosed with PTSD when displaying PTSD-like symptoms. Therefore, the more complex symptoms of psychosis may prevent the clinical detection required when diagnosing PTSD. In addition, those who have been diagnosed with PTSD and have an identified form of trauma show positive symptoms of psychosis such as delusions and/or hallucinations.Lindley, S. E., Carlson, E. B., & Sheikh, J. I. (2000). Psychotic symptoms in posttraumatic stress disorder. CNS Spectrums, 5(9), 52-57. Finally, it has been suggested that individuals suffering from psychosis may be more vulnerable to intrusions.Steel, C., Fowler, D., & Holmes, E. A. (2005).

He was the coach of the North Melbourne Football Club from 2010 until 2019. AFL career=Hawthorn= Scott was recruited to Hawthorn in the 1994 national draft at pick 60, without playing a game, he was delisted and then re-drafted by Hawthorn in the 1996 draft, where he won the reserves best-and-fairest. Making his senior debut in 1997, Brad played all 22 games and was seen as a very solid contributor, but was traded at the end of that season to the Brisbane Lions, enabling him to play in the same side as his brother Chris. =Brisbane Lions= Scott was a very solid contributor over a number of years with the Lions and was seen as a fearless figure in defence. While defiant, Scott battled numerous injuries including one incurred during his milestone 150th game late in 2005. Like his brother, Scott was renowned for being one of the hardest players in the league. They were both integral members of the Lions' first two premierships in 2001 and 2002. Injuries saw him miss the 2003 premiership and sidelined for the latter part of 2004. Scott's lacklustre form in 2004 and 2005 fed speculation that his contract with the Lions would not be renewed, however he remained with the club and announced on 10 August 2006 that he would retire at the end of the season. Scott played his farewell game in Round 22 against the Saints. Coaching career Retirement from playing saw Scott as the development coach at Collingwood, where he had success working closely with a number of young Magpies and other players. Scott was also a candidate for the vacant coaching position at Richmond, however he believed his skill set suited North far better and was appointed as North Melbourne coach for the 2010 season, signing a three-year contract on 17 August 2009. Scott had a terrible start to his coaching career, with three of the first four matches resulting in losses, including a 104-point thrashing from 2009 runners-up St Kilda. Since then, North made steady progress and finished outside the top eight on percentage. Although North Melbourne missed the finals for the second year in succession, Scott was rewarded with a contract extension as Kangaroos coach, with president James Brayshaw stating that he was satisfied with the club's progress under Scott. He led the team to 8th position and a spot in the finals at the end of the 2012 home and away season, with the side winning ten of its last twelve matches (including six in a row between Rounds 16‚Äì21) since a 115-point loss to Hawthorn in Round 10. The club was then defeated in their elimination final match against West Coast by 96 points. Following North Melbourne's disappointing season in 2013 after losing 10 matches by 16 points or less, the 2014 season began with a positive outlook as Nick Dal Santo was added to North Melbourne's list as a restricted free agent at the end of the 2013 season. With North Melbourne's now silky midfield looking strong, the success of the 2014 season saw Scott lead North Melbourne into his second finals series as coach after finishing 6th at the end of the premiership season. Winning their elimination final match against Essendon by 12 points, then defeating Geelong in the semi final to progress to Scotts' first preliminary final as coach against Sydney, the 71-point loss ended North Melbourne's finals run. The beginning of the 2015 season once again saw Scott make some vital inclusions to North Melbourne's list, with the addition of tall-forward Jarrad Waite and medium forward/midfielder Shaun Higgins. Despite finishing 8th, Scott was under scrutiny after a highly controversial decision to rest 9 players in Round 23 against Richmond, which was deemed by many to be a form of 'tanking'. Scott's 'plan' however, proved to be successful after defeating Richmond in the elimination final the following week by 17 points and going on to defeat Sydney in the semi final to become the first ever team to reach a preliminary final after finishing 8th in the premiership season. North Melbourne's run was ended by West Coast at Domain Stadium by 25 points. Scott currently ranks 3rd for most AFL/VFL games coached without making a grand final and is the only one of those three coaches to do it solely at the one club.http://afltables.com/afl/stats/coaches/coaches_idx.html Scott resigned as Kangaroos coach on 26 May 2019.Brad Scott has parted ways with North Melbourne in an emotional farewell 3AW 26 May 2019 Statistics =Playing statistics= - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  1997 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 28  22  6  7  233  101  334  75  36  0.3  0.3  10.6  4.6  15.2  3.4  1.6 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  1998 style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 5  19  5  6  201  106  307  52  32  0.3  0.3  10.6  5.6  16.2  2.7  1.7 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  1999 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 5  8  0  2  49  16  65  14  9  0.0  0.3  6.1  2.0  8.1  1.8  1.1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2000 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 5  0  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2001 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 5  22  14  4  197  108  305  84  44  0.6  0.2  9.0  4.9  13.9  3.8  2.0 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2002 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 5  25  8  10  315  179  494  136  55  0.3  0.4  12.6  7.2  19.8  5.4  2.2 - style=\\"background- color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2003 style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 5  22  5  8  245  166  411  112  48  0.2  0.4  11.1  7.5  18.7  5.1  2.2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2004 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 5  15  4  1  138  89  227  60  30  0.3  0.1  9.2  5.9  15.1  4.0  2.0 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2005 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 5  17  2  1  115  92  207  55  14  0.1  0.1  6.8  5.4  12.2  3.2  0.8 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2006 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 5  18  1  1  151  115  266  88  43  0.1  0.1  8.4  6.4  14.8  4.9  2.4 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 168 ! 45 ! 40 ! 1644 ! 972 ! 2616 ! 676 ! 311 ! 0.3 ! 0.2 ! 9.8 ! 5.8 ! 15.6 ! 4.0 ! 1.9 } =Coaching statistics= - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"2010  22  11  11  0  50.0%  9  16 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"2011  22  10  12  0  45.5%  9  17 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"2012  23  14  9  0  60.9%  8  18 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"2013  22  10  12  0  45.5%  10  18 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"2014  25  16  9  0  64.0%  6  18 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"2015  21  13  8  0  60%  4  18 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"2016  22  12  10  0  52.2%  8  18 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"2017  22  6  16  0  27.3%  15  18 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"2018  22  12  10  0  54.5%  9  18 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"2019  10  3  7  0  30%  17  18 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=2 Career totals ! 211 ! 106 ! 105 ! 0 ! 50.23% ! colspan=2} Personal life Scott's identical twin brother Chris Scott played alongside him at the Brisbane Lions and is now the coach of Geelong.

The concept and basic design were reused for the Super X-II in 1989's Godzilla vs. Biollante and the Super X-III in 1995's Godzilla vs. Destoroyah, both under the command of Sho Kuroki, Special Pilot of the Defense Agency. Variations=Super X= The Super X was a joint project of the Ground and Air Self-Defense Forces. Designated the Capital Defense Mobile Fortress T-1, it was a piloted VTOL craft constructed in secret to defend the Capital of Japan in case of emergency, in particular a nuclear attack. It was operated by a crew of six, armored with heat-resistant titanium alloy integrated with platinum circuitry, heavily armed with missiles, machine guns, and high-intensity lasers, and used three underside rotors for lift. The craft was thus well-suited to engage Godzilla in Shinjuku when the monster invaded Tokyo in 1984. Its magazine of missiles were fitted with cadmium warheads, which were temporarily able to control the nuclear reactions keeping Godzilla alive. However, the detonation of a nuclear missile in the stratosphere above Tokyo results in a spectacular lightning storm that revives Godzilla. Godzilla and the Super X then have a final battle. Godzilla fires an atomic breath blast that erodes the warship's armor causing its rotors to fail, and it crash lands near the Sumitomo building. Godzilla then destroys the Super X by toppling the building on to it. =Super X-II= A sleeker but broader shape defined the second Super X, a remotely operated VTOL craft designed specifically to combat Godzilla. It sported TA32 armor, claimed to be twice as resistant as the previous craft's; it also introduced the \\"Fire Mirror\\", a configuration of synthetic diamond designed to reflect Godzilla's ray, intensified 1,000-fold, though not as heat-resistant as the TA32. During the Super X-II's first bout with Godzilla, after several effective counterattacks the Fire Mirror began to melt. Godzilla's ray and tail damaged the ship, which was forced to retreat for repairs. Later, in Osaka, the Super X-II served as a decoy to maneuver Godzilla into firing range of a bazooka troop equipped with shells containing a biological agent. The craft taunted Godzilla almost into range of the troop until it ran out of missiles, at which point Major Kuroki ordered the still-damaged Fire Mirror engaged. Godzilla's next blast crippled the craft, which crashed into Osaka Business Park. Though the Super X-II was lost, the mission to infect Godzilla succeeded. The Super X-II appeared in Godzilla 2: War of the Monsters, a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment system as a playable unit, and made a cameo appearance in the final portion of the videogame Super Godzilla. The game manual described the Super X-II as being a mobile command center from which the player controlled Godzilla via the use of a special device that had been fired into Godzilla's body. The Super X-II, referred to simply as the Super X, despite the obvious design difference, also shoots down the final alien mothership in the game's final cutscene. The Super X-II also appears in Godzilla Generations, in the sixth and eighth levels. Unlike the Super X, the Super X-II will fly toward the character and strafe him rather than sitting and circling. The first few passes it may do nothing, but if the player begins attacking it will fire cadmium missiles and eventually use the Fire Mirror, which can reflect any playable monster's breath weapon, including the American Godzilla's. The Super X-II is tougher than the Super X and takes more hits to bring down. =Super X-III= Whereas Godzilla defense measures had by 1995 become the role of G-Force, the multipurpose fighter plane Super X-III was not designed exclusively as an anti-Godzilla weapon, but rather (as with the original Super X) to respond to a nuclear accident or attack. The winged V/STOL craft's central features are its cooling weapons, the Super-Low Temperature Beam and Freezing Missiles. Also like the original, it is piloted and operated by a three-person crew and equipped with cadmium missiles intended for long-range nuclear reaction control. Artificial diamond is incorporated into its alloy armor, making it strong enough to withstand repeated hits from Godzilla's ray. When Godzilla manifested signs of an imminent nuclear meltdown, G-Force's offensive weapons were determined unusable, and the Super X-III was called into action. Piloted (this time from within) by Kuroki, the craft engaged Godzilla at sea, using its cooling weapons to freeze Godzilla and cadmium missiles to slow its internal reactor. Encased in ice, Godzilla sank into the Bungo aqueduct. During Godzilla's later battle with Destoroyah the Super X-III looked on, preparing to again shell Godzilla with cadmium when it hit a critical meltdown temperature. When Destoroyah attempted to flee, the Super X-III fired its Low Temperature Beam, disabling and apparently disintegrating Destoroyah. Though it fired several cadmium shells at Godzilla during the subsequent meltdown, protected by its armor from the immense nuclear fallout, it was unable to control the process. This Super X is the only such vehicle to have beaten Godzilla (albeit temporarily) without being destroyed as well. The Super X-III appears in Godzilla: Save the Earth as an obstacle, if the player or their opponent is hit by its missiles, they become temporarily frozen, leaving them vulnerable to their opponent. The Super X-III is the final \\"boss\\" enemy in Godzilla Generations. Appearing in the tenth and final level, which is Tokyo from The Return of Godzilla with the main theme from the film, the Super X-III behaves similarly to the Super X-II. However, the Super X-III often begins attacking with the first run and uses both lasers and missiles (without the freezing properties). It has very high armor and is faster than the Super X-II, making it very difficult to take down quickly. It is also much larger than its forerunners, with a length 1/3 that of Godzilla's height and a wingspan over 1/2 his height. All three models in the Super X line appear in Godzilla.

In some cases, children born in Portugal to non-citizens may be eligible for Portuguese citizenship. However this does not apply to children born to tourists or short-term visitors. Portuguese citizenship law is complicated by the existence of numerous former colonies and in some cases it is possible to claim Portuguese citizenship by connection with one of these jurisdictions. The most notable of these are Portuguese India (annexed by India in 1961), East Timor and Macau. The 1981 Portuguese nationality law, is based on the principle of jus sanguinis, while the previous law of 1959 was based on the principle of jus soli. This shift occurred in 1975 and 1981, thus basically making it difficult to access naturalization not only to first generation migrants, but also to their children and grandchildren. In 2006, was this situation slightly changed, but still stressing jus sanguinis. In 2012, Portugal created the Golden Visa Program, which provides a way for non- EU residents to gain residency through property investment or job creation. Portuguese by origin Portuguese by origin are: * The children of a Portuguese mother or father born in Portuguese territory * The children of a Portuguese mother or father born abroad if the Portuguese parent is there serving the Portuguese State; * The children of a Portuguese mother or father born abroad if they have their birth registered at the Portuguese civil registry or if they declare that they want to be Portuguese; * The persons born in Portuguese territory to foreign parents if at least one of the parents was also born in Portugal and resides here, irrespective of title, at the time of birth; * The persons born in Portuguese territory to foreign parents who are not serving their respective State, if they declare that they want to be Portuguese and provided that one of the parents has legally resided in Portugal for at least two years at the time of the request (There is no age limit for the registration or declaration and it is retroactive to the time of birth. This right is extensive to the next generation only if the previous one completed it before death. No generations can be skipped); * The persons born in Portuguese territory who do not possess another nationality. * Persons born abroad with, at least, one Portuguese ascendant in the second degree (grandparent) of the direct line who has not lost this citizenship. Naturalisation as a Portuguese citizen A person aged 18 or over may be naturalised as a Portuguese citizen after 5 years legal residence. There is a requirement to have sufficient knowledge of the Portuguese language and effective links to the national community. Children aged under 18 may acquire Portuguese citizenship by declaration when a parent is naturalised, and future children of such Portuguese nationals will be considered Portuguese citizens by birth. A naturalised Portuguese citizen only starts to be considered Portuguese once the naturalisation process is done. Therefore, nationality acquired through naturalisation is not transmitted to any possible descendants already adult by the time their parents' naturalisation process is finished. From 2006 until 2015, a person whose grandparent did not lose Portuguese citizenship was exempt from the residence requirement when applying for naturalisation. As of 29 July 2015, those born outside Portugal who have at least one grandparent of Portuguese nationality, are granted Portuguese citizenship by extension immediately. The new registration procedure replaces the current provision of Article 6, no. 4‚Äîaccording to which a person who was born abroad and is a 2nd generation descendant of a citizen who has not lost his or her citizenship can acquire Portuguese citizenship by naturalisation, without a residence requirement. The amendment still needs to be signed by the President before entering into law. Portuguese citizenship by adoption A child adopted by a Portuguese citizen acquires Portuguese citizenship. The child should be under 18. Portuguese citizenship by marriage Previously, the law established that a partner could only apply for Portuguese citizenship after being married for 3 years or in a civil union or if they had relevant ties with Portugal. Since 2017 the minimum period of 3 years is suspended in case the couple has Portuguese nationality children. Jewish Law of Return An amendment to Portugal's 'Law on Nationality' allows descendants of Portuguese Jews who were expelled in the Portuguese Inquisition to become citizens if they 'belong to a Sephardic community of Portuguese origin with ties to Portugal.' The Portuguese parliament passed legislation facilitating the naturalization of descendants of 16th-century Jews who fled because of religious persecution. On that day Portugal became the only country besides Israel enforcing a Jewish Law of Return. Two years later, Spain adopted a similar measure. The motion, which was submitted by the Socialist and Center Right parties, was read on Thursday 11 April 2013 in parliament and approved unanimously on Friday 12 April 2013 as an amendment to Portugal's \\"Law on Nationality\\" (Decree-Law n.¬∫ 43/2013). Portuguese nationality law was further amended to this effect by Decree-Law n.¬∫ 30-A/2015, which came into effect on 1 March 2015. The amended law allows descendants of Jews who were expelled in the 16th century to become citizens if they \\"belong to a Sephardic community of Portuguese origin with ties to Portugal,\\" according to Jos√© Oulman Carp, president of Lisbon's Jewish community. The website of the World Jewish Congress says that the Jewish Community of Lisbon is the organization that unites local communal groups of Lisbon and its environs, while the Jewish Community of Oporto is the organization that unites local communal groups of Oporto. Applicants must be able to prove Sephardic surnames in their family tree. Another factor is \\"the language spoken at home,\\" a reference which also applies to Ladino (Judeo-Portuguese and/or Judeo-Spanish). Furthermore, applicants must be able to prove an \\"emotional and traditional connection with the former Portuguese Sephardic Community,\\" commonly established through a letter from an orthodox rabbi confirming Jewish heritage. The amendment also says applicants need not reside in Portugal, an exception to the requirement of six years of consecutive residency in Portugal for any applicant for citizenship. From 2015 several hundred Turkish Jews who were able to prove Sephardi ancestry have immigrated to Portugal and acquired citizenship. Nearly 1,800 descendants of Sephardic Jews acquired Portuguese nationality in 2017. By February 2018, 12,000 applications were in process, and 1,800 applicants had been granted Portuguese citizenship in 2017. By July 2019 there had been about 33,000 applications, of which about a third had already been granted after a long process of verification. Dual citizenship Portugal allows dual citizenship. Hence, Portuguese citizens holding or acquiring a foreign citizenship do not lose Portuguese citizenship. Similarly, those becoming Portuguese citizens do not have to renounce their foreign citizenship. Citizenship of the European Union Because Portugal forms part of the European Union, Portuguese citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Portuguese embassy, Portuguese citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.Article 20(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Rights abroad: Right to consular protection: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). Antigua and Barbuda (UK), Barbados (UK), Belize (UK), Central African Republic (France), Comoros (France), Gambia (UK), Guyana (UK), Liberia (Germany), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (UK), San Marino (Italy), S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe (Portugal), Solomon Islands (UK), Timor-Leste (Portugal), Vanuatu (France) Portuguese citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty. Former territories of Portugal Special rules exist concerning the acquisition of Portuguese citizenship through connections with: * Angola * Brazil * Cape Verde * Portuguese India * Guinea Bissau * Mozambique * S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe Portugal enacted Decree-Law 308-A/75 of 24 June 1974 to address the issue of losing or retaining Portuguese citizenship by those who had been born or were living in the Portuguese overseas territories which had gained independence. It was assumed that these persons would acquire the citizenship of the new state. The Decree-Law thus merely stipulated that Portuguese citizenship would be retained by those persons who had not been born overseas but were living there. In addition were those who, despite having been born in the territory of the colonies, had maintained a special connection with mainland Portugal by having been long-term residents there. All those not covered by one of the situations which enabled them to keep Portuguese citizenship would lose it ex lege. =Portuguese India= Formerly known as the Estado da √çndia this territory was an integral part of Portugal (as distinct from a colony) under Portugal's Constitution of 1910. On 19 December 1961 India annexed the territory by military force. The annexation was not recognised by Portugal until 1975, at which time Portugal re-established diplomatic relations with India. The recognition of Indian sovereignty over Portuguese India was backdated to 19 December 1961. Portuguese nationality law allows those who were Portuguese citizens connected with Portuguese India before 1961 to retain Portuguese nationality. Acquisition of Indian citizenship was determined to be non-voluntary at the time. One practical obstacle is that the civil records of Portuguese India were abandoned by Portugal during the invasion and hence it can be difficult for descendants of pre-1961 Portuguese citizens from Portuguese India to prove their status. =East Timor= East Timor was a territory of Portugal (Portuguese Timor) until its invasion by Indonesia in 1975, followed by annexation in 1976. Indonesian citizenship was conferred by Indonesia; however, while the Indonesian annexation was recognised by Australia and some other countries, Portugal did not recognise Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. As a result, Decree-Law 308-A/75 of 24 June 1974 was not enforced to revoke the Timorese of their Portuguese nationality. The question of whether East Timorese were entitled to Portuguese citizenship was raised on numerous occasions in the Australian courts in the context of applications for refugee status in Australia by East Timorese. The Australian immigration authorities argued that if East Timorese were Portuguese citizens, they should be expected to seek protection there and not in Australia. East Timor became an independent nation on 20 May 2002. However, owing to the lack of employment opportunities in their country and the becoming a member of Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, many East Timorese have taken advantage of Portuguese citizenship to live and work in Portugal and other EU countries, such as the UK. =Macau= The former Portuguese territory of Macau became a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China on 20 December 1999. Portugal had extended its nationality laws to Macau with those born before 1981 acquiring nationality by jus soli and by jus sanguinis after 1981. Many residents of Macau (either of Chinese & Portuguese descent) hold Portuguese citizenship on this basis. It is no longer possible to acquire Portuguese citizenship by connection with Macau before 3 October 1981 and after 20 December 1999 transfer of sovereignty to China, except by birth or association with the territory previous to that date. However, those born after 20 December 1999 to Portuguese from Macau or Macanese that hold Portuguese citizenship, and/or to Chinese who hold Portuguese citizenship, are eligible to the citizenship themselves due to the Portuguese heritage law (Jus Sanguinis), except when born to Chinese and/or Portuguese parents who possess Chinese citizenship after 20 December 1999 or when Chinese and/or Portuguese couple with Portuguese citizenship renounced their nationality by naturalization after 20 December 1999. Rights and obligations of Portuguese citizens All Portuguese citizens are: * able to vote in political elections upon reaching the age of 18. * able to run for political office. * able to vote in referendums. * able to obtain a Portuguese passport. * prevented from getting deported from Portugal. As Portuguese citizens are also European citizens, their rights include: * the right to live, work and retire in any member state of the European Union, for unlimited period. * the right to vote in local and European elections in other members states. * the right to stand in local and European elections in other members states. * the right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other member states when in a non-member state, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state. More information: Citizenship of the European Union Travel freedom of Portuguese citizens Visa requirements for Portuguese citizens Visa requirements for Portuguese citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Portugal. As of February 2018, Portuguese citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 186 countries and territories, ranking the Portuguese passport 4th in terms of travel freedom (tied with American, Austrian, British, Dutch, Luxembourgian, and Norwegian passports) according to the Henley Passport Index. The Portuguese nationality is ranked twelfth in Nationality Index (QNI). In addition to external factors including travel freedom, the QNI considers internal factors such as peace and stability, economic strength, and human development. Recent changes As of May 2015, under the newly approved Portuguese Nationality Act (Article 1, n.1, paragraph d) persons born abroad with, at least, one Portuguese ascendant in the second degree of the direct line who has not lost this citizenship, are Portuguese by origin, provided that they declare that they want to be Portuguese, that they have effective ties with the national community and, once these requirements are met, that are only required to register their birth in any Portuguese civil registry. In Portuguese nationality law occurred in 2006 based on the proposals of deputy Neves Moreira, member of the Democratic Social Party (PSD). Due to these changes, a foreign-born person whose grandparent never lost Portuguese citizenship is now able to request naturalisation without the need to document 6 years residence in Portugal. Because nationality acquired through naturalisation is not the same as nationality acquired through descent, members of the PSD proposed in 2009 another change in the law. This proposal would have given nationality by origin (descent) rather than by naturalisation to the grandchildren of Portuguese citizens but it was rejected. In 2013, members of the PSD tried to pass a similar measure again but due to the political and economic crisis that engulfed the country, no vote was ever taken on the measure.

He has been the head coach at UCLA, Pepperdine University, the University of Rhode Island and the University of Georgia over a combined total of 23 seasons. During the 1994‚Äì1995 season, he led UCLA to a 31‚Äì1 record and the school's eleventh national championship, its first since the 1974‚Äì75 season. Biography Born in Charleston, West Virginia, Harrick graduated in 1960 from Morris Harvey College, now known as the University of Charleston. He is of Lebanese ancestry. On November 20, 2009 Sally Lee Harrick, his wife of 49 years, died aged 70 from complications of scleroderma. =College coaching career= Harrick's coaching career began at Morningside High School in Inglewood, California where he served as an assistant coach from 1964 to 1969 and as head coach from 1970 to 1973. He was then hired as an assistant coach at Utah State University from 1974 to 1977. Harrick then spent two seasons as an assistant coach at UCLA from 1978 to 1979. His first collegiate head coaching job was at Pepperdine University in 1979, where he led the school to four NCAA Tournament appearances and was a conference coach of the year four times. UCLA In 1988, he returned to UCLA to assume head coaching duties after the firing of Walt Hazzard. During the recruiting period before his first season, he recruited Don MacLean, the most significant recruit to commit to Westwood in several years. McLean's arrival helped start a revival of the basketball program. By 1992, the Bruins were back in the Elite Eight, officially the first time they had advanced that far in 13 years. The 1979-80 team went all the way to the national championship game, but had that appearance vacated due to ineligible players. This was officially the second time they had advanced that far since John Wooden left the school. During the 1994‚Äì1995 season, he led UCLA to a 31‚Äì2 record (a loss to California was subsequently forfeited to the Bruins) and the school's eleventh national championship, its first since the 1974‚Äì75 season. The 31 wins would stand as a school record until the 2005‚Äì06 season. A year later, Harrick's Bruins were upset in the first round by Princeton. As it turned out, this would be the last game Harrick would coach in Westwood. Shortly before the start of the 1996‚Äì97 season, he was accused of falsifying receipts at a student-athlete recruiting dinner when two current players, Cameron Dollar and Charles O'Bannon, joined the table. Since Harrick paid for the entire meal, it amounted to an improper extra benefit for Dollar and O'Bannon. To cover up their presence, Harrick included the names of his wife and the wife of newly hired assistant Michael Holton on the expense report. When the school investigated, Harrick told Holton to tell athletic director Peter Dalis that Holton's wife was at the meal. However, a day later, Holton confessed that wasn't true. On November 6, 1996, Dalis and school chancellor Chuck Young gave Harrick an ultimatum: resign by the next morning or be fired. Harrick opted to take the firing. Although picking up the tab for Dollar and O'Bannon was a secondary violation at best, Young and Dalis felt Harrick's attempted cover-up was unforgivable.Wolff, Alexander Out To Dinner, Out Of A Job Sports Illustrated, November 18, 1996 However, Harrick claims that the NCAA has cleared him of wrongdoing.http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2482986 He left UCLA as the school's second-winningest coach, behind only Wooden. However, he is now third behind Wooden and Ben Howland. Rhode Island After a one-year hiatus, Harrick returned to coaching by accepting the head coach position at Rhode Island. He coached the Rams for two seasons (from 1997‚Äì99), where in both years they qualified for the NCAA Tournament. During the 1998 tournament, the Rams upset Kansas in the second round and reached the Midwest Regional finals but were defeated by Stanford 79‚Äì77. In his second season, he managed to recruit Lamar Odom and led the Rams to their first Atlantic 10 Conference tournament title. Georgia After the season, he left URI to become the head coach at the University of Georgia. He served there for four seasons (1999‚Äì00 through 2002‚Äì03), leading the Bulldogs to the NCAA tournament twice following a losing record. His tenure at Georgia ended in controversy in the spring of 2003. His son, Jim Harrick, Jr., a Georgia assistant, got into trouble for paying $300 in expenses for one of his players, Tony Cole.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/news/2003/02/27/cole_uga_ap He also gave an \\"A\\" to Cole, Rashad Wright and Chris Daniels for a basketball strategy class even though they never attended it.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/news/2003/03/10/georgiasuspends_harrick_ap After the story broke, Georgia pulled out of the 2003 SEC Tournament and withdrew from postseason consideration. The school suspended Harrick, Jr. on February 28, 2003 and fired him five days later. Harrick, Sr. was suspended on March 10 and resigned on March 27 after being told his contract wouldn't be renewed.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/news/2003/03/27/harrick_resigns_ap An NCAA investigation confirmed the violations, also finding that six players didn't pay for over $1,500 of long-distance telephone calls in December 2001. The telephone charges in question were due to hotel error and ultimately never charged to the program. Since they weren't valid charges, Georgia didn't self- report the violations until an internal investigation into the program in July 2003. In 2004 the NCAA placed Georgia on four years' probation for the violations. It also forced the Bulldogs to vacate half of their wins from 2001‚Äì02 and all their wins from 2002‚Äì03‚Äî30 games in all. Harrick, Jr. was given a seven-year show-cause penalty order for his role in the academic fraud, as well as telling two of the players involved to lie to the NCAA. The 'show-cause' effectively blackballed him from the college ranks until 2011 at the earliest.https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/miSearch?miSearchSubmit=publicReport&key;=574&publicTerms;=THIS%20PHRASE%20WILL%20NOT%20BE%20REPEATED =Later career= After Georgia, Harrick worked as a scout for the NBA's Denver Nuggets and helped develop basketball in China. On June 13, 2006, Harrick accepted the head coaching position for the Bakersfield Jam, an NBA Development League team.Harrick to coach Bakersfield in NBA D-league, Associated Press, June 13, 2006.

Origin The idea is credited to Bruce Feiler and first defined by Mickey Kaus in a February 24, 2000 Kausfiles blog post and Slate online magazine article, \\"Faster Politics: 'Momentum' ain't what it used to be\\". In an article published two weeks later, on March 9, 2000, Kaus gave the theory the name \\"Feiler faster thesis\\". In the original article, Kaus describes two trends: the speeding up of the news cycle and the compression of the schedule of primaries for the 2000 U.S. general election. Kaus wrote: \\"Feiler's point is that we should put these two trends togetherand that when we do, Trend 1 considerably softens the impact of Trend 2.\\" Kaus uses the observation to reassess the concept of momentum in politics, suggesting that there are now simply more opportunities for turns of fortune and that voters are able, for the most part, to keep up. Definition refined Kaus's second interpretation in a later article is broader and more succinct: Application The idea is based on James Gleick's 1999 book Faster, which makes the argument that the pace of Western society in general, and American society in particular, has increased and that \\"a compression of time characterizes the life of the century now closing\\". Gleick documents the ways technology speeds up work and the time people spend doing various tasks, including sleeping. He points out that \\"we have learned to keep efficiency in mind as a goal, which means that we drive ourselves hard.\\" Gleick's key observation is that \\"some of us say we want to save time when really we just want to do more\\". The thesis is sometimes misinterpreted as merely describing the shortening of the news cycle, which is actually covered as part of Gleick's original observations. Kaus recognized the difference in a 2005 posting: \\"The FFT, remember, doesn't say that information moves with breathtaking speed these days. (Everyone knows that!) The FFT says that people are comfortable processing that information with what seems like breathtaking speed.\\"Mickey Kaus Faster History, Faster Democracy?

The framework aims to provide a non-arbitrary account for phonological phenomena by replacing the rule component of SPE-type phonology with well-formedness constraints on representations. Thus, it is a non-derivational representation-based framework, and as such, the current representative of Autosegmental Phonology. GP subscribes to the claim that Universal Grammar is composed of a restricted set of universal principles and parameters. As in Noam Chomsky‚Äôs principles and parameters approach to syntax, the differences in phonological systems across languages are captured through different combinations of parameter settings.  Element Theory  The sub- theory of GP modelling the internal structure of segments is called Element Theory (ET). Like chemical elements, the melodic primes of ET are phonetically interpretable alone as well as in combinations - hence their name. They are assumed, depending on the version of ET, to correspond to either characteristic acoustic signatures in the signal, or articulatory gestures (or hot features, as previously referred to). Unlike the (binary) distinctive features of Structuralist Phonology and SPE, each element is a monovalent (unary, single-valued) and potentially interpretable phonological expression. ET has a number of versions and has since KLV 1985 been reformed in various ways with the aim of reducing the element inventory, to avoid overgeneration (being able to generate more structures than attested cross-linguistically). In its most widespread version, there are 6 elements believed to be existent across all languages: (A), (I), (U), ( î), (L) and (H), representing openness/coronality, frontness/palatality, roundness/labiality, stopness, voicing/nasality and frication/aspiration, respectively. Their actual interpretation depends on what phonological constituent dominates them, and whether they occupy a head or operator position within a phonological expression. For instance, when simplex, (I) is interpreted as /i/ in a syllable peak (nucleus), but as /j/ at a syllable edge (typically, in a syllable onset). (A) makes /a/ in a nucleus but /r/ in a consonantal position. In complex phonological expressions, the phonetic properties mix in proportion to the head/operator status: the (A, I) expression is both open (non-high) and front, but it is more probably interpreted as [e] when the head is (I), and as […õ] or [√¶] when the head is (A).  Syllable structure without syllables  In its classical form (sometimes referred to as GP 1.0), developed in KLV 1990, prosodic structure is modelled as a sequence of Onset-Rhyme (O-R) pairs, where the syllable rhyme obligatorily contains a nucleus (N). According to their parameter settings (see above), languages may allow any of these syllabic constituents to branch (into two, maximally). Similarly to Government and Binding syntax, constituents are governing domains in which the head (or governor) governs, that is, establishes an asymmetrical, dependency relation with the governee (or complement) - it is this feature of GP that it takes its name from. A unique property of GP as a theoretical model is the denial of the constituenthood (that is, the theoretical status) of two of the components of classical syllabic theory: the coda on the one hand, and the syllable itself on the other. The coda is shown to be unable to branch universally, which is in GP explained by assuming no coda node in the representation (and only positing what is dubbed \\"post-nuclear rhymal complement\\"); the syllable (hypothetically, a higher-order constituent dominating each O-R pair) does not qualify as an intraconstituent governing domain since its head (the R) follows its complement (the O) rather than preceding it, as observed in all other cases of branching constituents. As in mainstream Autosegmental Phonology, GP claims that the O may be empty in certain languages, either word-initially (producing surface vowel-initial words) or word-internally (producing sequences of heterosyllabic vowels, that is, hiatuses), or both. GP also claims that certain languages license empty nuclei, which are subject to the phonological Empty Category Principle (ECP), similarly to the empty categories of syntax. Crucially, all surface word-final consonants are Onsets followed by an empty Nucleus (called domain-final empty nucleus, or FEN), which is licensed by parameter: languages in which the parameter is switched on allow for (surface) consonant-final words (like English), whereas languages in which the parameter is off have all their (content) words ending in a vowel as well as various repair strategies modifying foreign words and loanwords so that they satisfy the constraint (e.g., Italian, Japanese). Another special case is word-initial /sC/ clusters (as in English sport, stop, school), which are analysed in Kaye (1992) as surface manifestations of underlying sequences of an empty N plus rhyme-final /s/ plus O, where the initial empty N is parametrically licensed (\\"magically\\", as Kaye puts it) - this effect has been known as \\"Magic Licensing\\".  GP today  Today, whilst Optimality Theory has become the dominant framework in generative, formal phonological theory, GP continues to develop. In 1996, Lowenstamm proposed that syllable structure should be further reduced to strictly alternating onsets (symbolised by \\"C\\") and nuclei (\\"V\\") - all surface clusters sandwich empty categories, which conform to the ECP (see above). This version of GP has become known as Strict CV Phonology or CVCV Phonology, and is currently the most widely accepted model of prosodic structure within GP circles. (See Tobias Scheer's and P√©ter Szigetv√°ri's work.) The other major current trend in GP is represented by P√∂chtragerP√∂chtrager, M. A. (2006). The structure of length. PhD Thesis. Vienna: Universit√§t Wien. and his colleagues, who propose GP 2.0, another version of GP that strives to further reduce the number of elements by capturing manner of articulation (old ( î) and (h)/(H)) as well as element (A) with structure. Unlike CVCV Phonology's flat prosodic structure, configurations within GP 2.0 remain hierarchical and involve multiple layers, with the nodes entering into governing and m-commanding relations, very much as in X-bar theory syntax. Further work in GP and GP-friendly frameworks includes ET-based research in laryngeal phonology, as well as analyses in Loose CV Phonology and Precedence-Free Phonology. GP-ists and related researchers regularly meet at the Government Phonology Round Table (GPRT), a semi-informal meeting originally (starting in 1997) organised by teams of scholars at universities in Budapest, Hungary and Vienna, Austria. Later, a few events were organised in Slovenia. Recently, Budapest and Vienna have taken turns again as venues.  Further reading  Cyran, Eugeniusz (2003) Complexity Scales and Licensing in Phonology.

EPI is found in humans afflicted with cystic fibrosis and Shwachman‚ÄìDiamond syndrome, and is common in dogs. EPI is caused by a progressive loss of the pancreatic cells that make digestive enzymes; loss of digestive enzymes leads to maldigestion and malabsorption of nutrients from normal digestive processes. Chronic pancreatitis is the most common cause of EPI in humans and cats. In dogs, the most common cause is pancreatic acinar atrophy, arising as a result of genetic conditions, a blocked pancreatic duct, or prior infection. The exocrine pancreas is a portion of this organ that contains clusters of ducts (acini) producing bicarbonate anion, a mild alkali, as well as an array of digestive enzymes that together empty by way of the interlobular and main pancreatic ducts into the duodenum (upper small intestine). The hormones cholecystokinin and secretin secreted by the stomach and duodenum in response to distension and the presence of food in turn stimulate the production of digestive enzymes by the exocrine pancreas. The alkalization of the duodenum neutralizes the acidic chyme produced by the stomach that is passing into it; the digestive enzymes serve to catalyze the breakdown of complex foodstuffs into smaller molecules for absorption and integration into metabolic pathways. The enzymes include proteases (trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen), hydrolytic enzymes that cleave lipids (the lipases phospholipase A2 and lysophospholipase, and cholesterol esterase), and amylase to digest starches. EPI results from progressive failure in the exocrine function of the pancreas to provide its digestive enzymes, often in response to a genetic condition or other disease state, resulting in the inability of the animal involved to properly digest food. Signs and symptoms Loss of pancreatic enzymes leads to maldigestion and malabsorption, which may in turn lead to: * anemia (Vitamin B12, iron, folate deficiency) * bleeding disorders (Vitamin K malabsorption) * edema (hypoalbuminemia) * fatigue * flatulence and abdominal distention (bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed food) * hypocalcemia * metabolic bone disease (Vitamin D deficiency) * neurologic manifestation * steatorrhea * weight loss Causes and pathogenesis In humans, the most common causes of EPI are chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis, the former a longstanding inflammation of the pancreas altering the organ's normal structure and function that can arise as a result of malnutrition, heredity, or (in the Western world especially), behaviour (alcohol use, smoking), and the latter a recessive hereditary disease most common in Europeans and Ashkenazi Jews where the molecular culprit is an altered, CFTR-encoded chloride channel. According to WebMD, \\"Crohn's disease and celiac disease can also lead to EPI in some people\\". In children, another common cause is Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation in the SBDS gene. Diagnosis The three main tests used in considering a diagnosis of EPI are: fecal elastase test, fecal fat test, and a direct pancreatic function test. The latter is a limitedly used test that assesses exocrine function in the pancreas by inserting a tube into the small intestine to collect pancreatic secretions. Treatment EPI is often treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement products (PERPs) such as pancrelipase, that are used to break down fats (via a lipase), proteins (via a protease), and carbohydrates (via amylase) into units that can be digested. Pancrelipase is typically porcine derived and requires large doses. Other animals=Causes and pathogenesis= Chronic pancreatitis is the most common cause of EPI in cats. In dogs, where the condition has been deemed common, the usual cause is by pancreatic acinar atrophy, arising as a result of genetic conditions, a blocked pancreatic duct, or prior infection. In dogs, EPI is most common in young German Shepherds, and in Finland Rough Collies, and is inherited. In German Shepherds, the method of inheritance is through an autosomal recessive gene. In these two breeds, at least, the cause appears to be immune-mediated as a sequela to lymphocytic pancreatitis. The German Shepherd makes up about two-thirds of cases seen with EPI. Other breeds reported to be predisposed to EPI include terrier breeds, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Chow Chows, and Picardy Shepherds. =Symptoms= In animals, signs of EPI are not present until 85 to 90 percent of the pancreas is unable to secrete its enzymes. In dogs, symptoms include weight loss, poor hair coat, flatulence, increased appetite, coprophagia, and diarrhea. Feces are often yellow-gray in color with an oily texture. There are many concurrent diseases that mimic EPI, and severe pancreatitis is one that if allowed to continue unabated can lead to EPI. =Diagnosis and treatment= The most reliable test for EPI in dogs and cats is serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI); a low value indicates EPI. Fecal elastase levels may also be used for diagnosis in dogs. In dogs, the best treatment is to supplement the animals' food with dried pancreatic extracts. There are commercial preparations available, but chopped bovine pancreas from the butcher can also be used. (Pork pancreas should not be used because of the rare transmission of pseudorabies). Symptoms usually improve within a few days, but lifelong treatment is required to manage the condition. A rare side-effect of use of dried pancreatic extracts is oral ulceration and bleeding. Because of malabsorption, serum levels of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) and tocopherol (vitamin E) may be low. These may be supplemented, although since cyanocobalamin contains the toxic chemical cyanide, dogs that have serious cobalamin issues should instead be treated with hydroxocobalamin or methylcobalamin. Cyanocobalamin deficiency is very common in cats with EPI because about 99 percent of intrinsic factor (which is required for cyanocobalamin absorption from the intestine) is secreted by the pancreas. In dogs, this figure is about 90 percent, and only about 50 percent of dogs have this deficiency. Cats may suffer from Vitamin K deficiencies. If there is bacterial overgrowth in the intestine, antibiotics should be used, especially if treatment is not working. In dogs failing to gain weight or continuing to show symptoms, modifying the diet to make it low-fiber and highly digestible may help. Despite previous belief that low-fat diets are beneficial in dogs with EPI, more recent studies have shown that a high-fat diet may increase absorption of nutrients and better manage the disease. However, it has been shown that different dogs respond to different dietary modifications, so the best diet must be determined on a case-by-case basis. One possible sequela, volvulus (mesenteric torsion), is a rare consequence of EPI in dogs.

The 2021 date is April 14.http://www.chinasage.info/festivals.htm  China  The Double Third or Shangsi Festival is an ancient Chinese festival celebrated on the third day of the third month of the Chinese calendar. During the festival people would go for an outing by the water, picnic, and pluck orchids. It is also a day for invoking cleansing rituals to prevent disease and get rid of bad luck. The day is also traditionally considered to be a possible birthday of the Yellow Emperor.Nedostup, R. Superstitious Regimes: Religion and Politics of Chinese Modernity Harvard University Press: Cambridge 2009 The ancient traditions of Shangsi are mostly celebrated by a few local communities today, such as the ancient village of Xinye which holds elaborate ancestor worship ceremonies on this day. The great calligrapher Wang Xizhi mentions this festival in his famous work Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Poems, written in regard to the Orchid Pavilion Gathering during the Six Dynasties era. This holiday is also celebrated in Korea, where it is called Samjinnal or sangsa, in Japan as Hinamatsuri.  Korea  Samjinnal is one of sesi pungsok (ÏÑ∏ÏãúÌíçÏÜç) or Korean traditional customs by season, which falls on the third day of the third month in the Korean lunar calendar. It was called samjil (ÏÇºÏßà) in old Korean language and referred to as sangsa, wonsa (ÏõêÏÇ¨, ÂÖÉÂ∑≥), sungsam (Ï§ëÏÇº, Èáç‰∏â), sangje (ÏÉÅÏ†ú, ‰∏äÈô§) or dapcheongjeol (ÎãµÏ≤≠Ï†à, Ë∏èÈùëÁØÄ) in hanja. Samjinnal implies the overlapping of Sam (three). According to Choi Namseon, samjil was derived from the consonants of Samil, and Sangsa is defined as the first snake day of the 3rd lunar month.http://www.lifeinkorea.com/culture/festivals/festivals.cfm?Subject=Samjinnal =Customs= ssuktteok, mugwort rice cakes Samjinnal is the festive day that informs the arrival of spring. This day is known as the day the swallows came back from Gangnam and the day the snake came out from its winter sleep. It is also the day birds and butterflies start to appear. This day, in the North Gyeongsang region, seeing a snake signifies good luck, seeing a white butterfly means death that year, and seeing a yellow butterfly implies fortune. They say soybean paste brewed this day tastes especially good and houses are repaired. By conducting farm frugality, people pray for abundance. During Samjinnal, people pick out azalea flowers and knead it with glutinous rice dough to make Hwajeon, a Korean traditional rice cake. Mung bean powder is used to make mung bean noodles, and is also occasionally used with the azalea flowers. By dyeing the mung bean powder with red water, a seasonal dish called Sumyeon can be prepared. Other than this, white bubble rice cakes made with red bean paste called Santteok, Goritteok made from glutinous rice, pine endodermis and mugwort, and Ssuktteok made from glutinous rice and mugwort leaves are eaten this day. =Nori (Folk games)= *Pulssaum (ÌíÄÏã∏ÏõÄ) *Pulgaksi noleum (ÌíÄÍ∞ÅÏãúÎÜÄÏùå) *Fortunetelling *Hwajeon nori (ÌôîÏ†ÑÎÜÄÏù¥, Ëä±ÁÖé) - It literally means \\"flower pancake play\\".

Because neutrinos only weakly interact with other particles of matter, neutrino detectors must be very large to detect a significant number of neutrinos. Neutrino detectors are often built underground, to isolate the detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation. The field of neutrino astronomy is still very much in its infancy - the only confirmed extraterrestrial sources so far as of 2018 are the Sun and the supernova 1987A in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud. Another likely source (three standard deviations) is the blazar TXS 0506+056 about 3.7 billion light years away. Neutrino observatories will \\"give astronomers fresh eyes with which to study the universe\\". Various detection methods have been used. Super Kamiokande is a large volume of water surrounded by phototubes that watch for the Cherenkov radiation emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an electron or muon in the water. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is similar, but uses heavy water as the detecting medium. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of chlorine or gallium which are periodically checked for excesses of argon or germanium, respectively, which are created by neutrinos interacting with the original substance. MINOS uses a solid plastic scintillator watched by phototubes; Borexino uses a liquid pseudocumene scintillator also watched by phototubes; and the NOŒΩA detector uses a liquid scintillator watched by avalanche photodiodes. The proposed acoustic detection of neutrinos via the thermoacoustic effect is the subject of dedicated studies done by the ANTARES, IceCube, and KM3NeT collaborations. Theory Neutrinos are omnipresent in nature such that every second, tens of billions of them \\"pass through every square centimetre of our bodies without us ever noticing.\\" Many were created during the big bang and others are generated by nuclear reactions inside stars, planets, and other interstellar processes. According to scientists' speculations, some may also originate from events in the universe such as \\"colliding black holes, gamma ray bursts from exploding stars, and/or violent events at the cores of distant galaxies\\". Despite how common they are, neutrinos are extremely \\"difficult to detect\\" due to their low mass and lack of electric charge. Unlike other particles, neutrinos only interact via gravity and the neutral current (involving the exchange of a Z boson) or charged current (involving the exchange of a W boson) weak interactions. As they have only a \\"smidgen of rest mass\\" according to the laws of physics, perhaps less than a \\"millionth as much as an electron\\", the gravitational force caused by neutrinos has proven too weak to detect, leaving the weak interaction as the main method for detection: * In a neutral current interaction, the neutrino enters and then leaves the detector after having transferred some of its energy and momentum to a target particle. If the target particle is charged and sufficiently lightweight (e.g. an electron), it may be accelerated to a relativistic speed and consequently emit Cherenkov radiation, which can be observed directly. All three neutrino flavors, or flavours (electronic, muonic and tauonic) can participate regardless of the neutrino energy. However, no neutrino flavor information is left behind. * In a charged current interaction, a high-energy neutrino transforms into its partner lepton (electron, muon, or tau). However, if the neutrino does not have sufficient energy to create its heavier partner's mass, the charged current interaction is unavailable to it. Neutrinos from the sun and from nuclear reactors have enough energy to create electrons. Most accelerator-based neutrino beams can also create muons, and a few can create tauons. A detector which can distinguish among these leptons can reveal the flavor of the incident neutrino in a charged current interaction. Because the interaction involves the exchange of a charged boson, the target particle also changes character (e.g., ). Detection techniques=Scintillators= Antineutrinos were first detected near the Savannah River nuclear reactor by the Cowan‚ÄìReines neutrino experiment in 1956. Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan used two targets containing a solution of cadmium chloride in water. Two scintillation detectors were placed next to the water targets. Antineutrinos with an energy above the threshold of 1.8 MeV caused charged current \\"inverse beta-decay\\" interactions with the protons in the water, producing positrons and neutrons. The resulting positron annihilate with electrons, creating pairs of coincident photons with an energy of about 0.5 MeV each, which could be detected by the two scintillation detectors above and below the target. The neutrons were captured by cadmium nuclei resulting in delayed gamma rays of about 8 MeV that were detected a few microseconds after the photons from a positron annihilation event. This experiment was designed by Cowan and Reines to give a unique signature for antineutrinos, to prove the existence of these particles. It was not the experimental goal to measure the total antineutrino flux. The detected antineutrinos thus all carried an energy greater than 1.8 MeV, which is the threshold for the reaction channel used (1.8 MeV is the energy needed to create a positron and a neutron from a proton). Only about 3% of the antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor carry enough energy for the reaction to occur. A more recently built and much larger KamLAND detector used similar techniques to study oscillations of antineutrinos from 53 Japanese nuclear power plants. A smaller, but more radiopure Borexino detector was able to measure the most important components of the neutrino spectrum from the Sun, as well as antineutrinos from Earth and nuclear reactors. =Radiochemical methods= Chlorine detectors, based on the method suggested by Bruno Pontecorvo, consist of a tank filled with a chlorine containing fluid such as tetrachloroethylene. A neutrino occasionally converts a chlorine-37 atom into one of argon-37 via the charged current interaction. The threshold neutrino energy for this reaction is 0.814 MeV. The fluid is periodically purged with helium gas which would remove the argon. The helium is then cooled to separate out the argon, and the argon atoms are counted based on their electron capture radioactive decays. A chlorine detector in the former Homestake Mine near Lead, South Dakota, containing 520 short tons (470 metric tons) of fluid, was the first to detect the solar neutrinos, and made the first measurement of the deficit of electron neutrinos from the sun (see Solar neutrino problem). A similar detector design, with a much lower detection threshold of 0.233 MeV, uses a transformation which is sensitive to lower- energy neutrinos. A neutrino is able to react with an atom of gallium-71, converting it into an atom of the unstable isotope germanium-71. The germanium was then chemically extracted and concentrated. Neutrinos were thus detected by measuring the radioactive decay of germanium. This latter method is nicknamed the \\"Alsace-Lorraine\\" technique because of the reaction sequence (gallium‚Üígermanium‚Üígallium) involved. The SAGE experiment in Russia used about 50 tons, and the GALLEX / GNO experiments in Italy about 30 tons, of gallium as reaction mass. The price of gallium is prohibitive, so this experiment is difficult to afford on large-scale. Larger experiments have therefore turned to a less costly reaction mass. Radiochemical detection methods are only useful for counting neutrinos; they provide almost no information on neutrino energy or direction of travel. =Cherenkov detectors= \\"Ring-imaging\\" Cherenkov detectors take advantage of a phenomenon called Cherenkov light. Cherenkov radiation is produced whenever charged particles such as electrons or muons are moving through a given detector medium somewhat faster than the speed of light in that medium. In a Cherenkov detector, a large volume of clear material such as water or ice is surrounded by light-sensitive photomultiplier tubes. A charged lepton produced with sufficient energy and moving through such a detector does travel somewhat faster than the speed of light in the detector medium (although somewhat slower than the speed of light in a vacuum). The charged lepton generates a visible \\"optical shockwave\\" of Cherenkov radiation. This radiation is detected by the photomultiplier tubes and shows up as a characteristic ring-like pattern of activity in the array of photomultiplier tubes. As neutrinos can interact with atomic nuclei to produce charged leptons which emit Cherenkov radiation, this pattern can be used to infer direction, energy, and (sometimes) flavor information about incident neutrinos. Two water-filled detectors of this type (Kamiokande and IMB) recorded a neutrino burst from supernova SN 1987A. Scientists detected 19 neutrinos from an explosion of a star inside the Large Magellanic Cloud ‚Äì only 19 out of the octo-decillion (1057) neutrinos emitted by the supernova. The Kamiokande detector was able to detect the burst of neutrinos associated with this supernova, and in 1988 it was used to directly confirm the production of solar neutrinos. The largest such detector is the water-filled Super- Kamiokande. This detector uses 50,000 tons of pure water surrounded by 11,000 photomultiplier tubes buried 1 km underground. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) uses 1,000 tonnes of ultrapure heavy water contained in a 12 metre-diameter vessel made of acrylic plastic surrounded by a cylinder of ultrapure ordinary water 22 metres in diameter and 34 metres high. In addition to the neutrino interactions visible in a regular water detector, a neutrino can break up the deuterium in heavy water. The resulting free neutron is subsequently captured, releasing a burst of gamma rays that can be detected. All three neutrino flavors participate equally in this dissociation reaction. The MiniBooNE detector employs pure mineral oil as its detection medium. Mineral oil is a natural scintillator, so charged particles without sufficient energy to produce Cherenkov light still produce scintillation light. Low- energy muons and protons, invisible in water, can be detected. Thus the use of natural environment as a measurement medium emerged. Since the neutrino flux incoming to earth decreases with increasing energy, the size of neutrino detectors must increase too. Though building a kilometer-sized cube detector underground covered by thousands of photomultiplier would be prohibitively expensive, detection volumes of this magnitude can be achieved by installing Cherenkov detector arrays deep inside already existing natural water or ice formations, with several other advantages. Firstly, hundreds of meters of water or ice partly protect the detector from atmospheric muons. Secondly, these environments are transparent and dark, vital criteria in order to detect the faint Cherenkov light. In practice, because of Potassium 40 decay, even the abyss is not completely dark, so this decay must be used as a baseline. An illustration of the Antares neutrino detector deployed under water. Located at a depth of about 2.5 km in the Mediterranean Sea, the ANTARES telescope (Astronomy with a Neutrino Telescope and Abyss environmental Research) has been fully operational since 30 May 2008. Consisting of an array of twelve separate 350 meter-long vertical detector strings 70 meters apart, each with 75 photomultiplier optical modules, this detector uses the surrounding sea water as the detector medium. The next generation deep sea neutrino telescope KM3NeT will have a total instrumented volume of about 5 km3. The detector will be distributed over three installation sites in the Mediterranean. Implementation of the first phase of the telescope was started in 2013. The Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) operated from 1996‚Äì2004. This detector used photomultiplier tubes mounted in strings buried deep (1.5‚Äì2 km) inside Antarctic glacial ice near the South Pole. The ice itself is the detector medium. The direction of incident neutrinos is determined by recording the arrival time of individual photons using a three-dimensional array of detector modules each containing one photomultiplier tube. This method allows detection of neutrinos above 50 GeV with a spatial resolution of approximately 2 degrees. AMANDA was used to generate neutrino maps of the northern sky to search for extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to search for dark matter. AMANDA has been upgraded to the IceCube observatory, eventually increasing the volume of the detector array to one cubic kilometer. Ice Cube sits deep underneath the South Pole in a cubic kilometre of perfectly clear, bubble-free ancient ice. Like AMANDA it relies on detecting the flickers of light emitted on the exceedingly rare occasions when a neutrino does interact with an atom of ice or water. =Radio detectors= The Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment uses antennas to detect Cherenkov radiation from high-energy neutrinos in Antarctica. The Antarctic Impulse Transient Antenna (ANITA) is a balloon-borne device flying over Antarctica and detecting Askaryan radiation produced by ultra-high-energy neutrinos interacting with the ice below. =Tracking calorimeters= Tracking calorimeters such as the MINOS detectors use alternating planes of absorber material and detector material. The absorber planes provide detector mass while the detector planes provide the tracking information. Steel is a popular absorber choice, being relatively dense and inexpensive and having the advantage that it can be magnetised. The active detector is often liquid or plastic scintillator, read out with photomultiplier tubes, although various kinds of ionisation chambers have also been used. The NOŒΩA proposal suggests eliminating the absorber planes in favor of using a very large active detector volume.Radovic, Alexander (12 January 2018). \\"Latest Oscillation Results from NOvA from NOvA\\" (Joint Experimental- Theoretical Physics). NOvA Document Database. Femilab. Retrieved 30 March 2018 Tracking calorimeters are only useful for high-energy (GeV range) neutrinos. At these energies, neutral current interactions appear as a shower of hadronic debris and charged current interactions are identified by the presence of the charged lepton's track (possibly alongside some form of hadronic debris). A muon produced in a charged current interaction leaves a long penetrating track and is easy to spot; The length of this muon track and its curvature in the magnetic field provide energy and charge ( versus ) information. An electron in the detector produces an electromagnetic shower, which can be distinguished from hadronic showers if the granularity of the active detector is small compared to the physical extent of the shower. Tau leptons decay essentially immediately to either another charged lepton or pions, and cannot be observed directly in this kind of detector. (To directly observe taus, one typically looks for a kink in tracks in photographic emulsion.) =Coherent Recoil Detector= At low energies, a neutrino can scatter from the entire nucleus of an atom, rather than the individual nucleons, in a process known as coherent neutral current neutrino-nucleus elastic scattering or coherent neutrino scattering. This effect has been used to make an extremely small neutrino detector. Unlike most other detection methods, coherent scattering does not depend on the flavor of the neutrino. Background suppression Most neutrino experiments must address the flux of cosmic rays that bombard the Earth's surface. The higher-energy (>50 MeV or so) neutrino experiments often cover or surround the primary detector with a \\"veto\\" detector which reveals when a cosmic ray passes into the primary detector, allowing the corresponding activity in the primary detector to be ignored (\\"vetoed\\"). Since the atmospheric muon incident flux is isotropic, a localised and anisotropic detection is discriminated in relation to the background betraying a cosmic event. For lower-energy experiments, the cosmic rays are not directly the problem. Instead, the spallation neutrons and radioisotopes produced by the cosmic rays may mimic the desired signals. For these experiments, the solution is to place the detector deep underground so that the earth above can reduce the cosmic ray rate to acceptable levels. Neutrino telescopes Neutrino detectors can be aimed at astrophysics observations, many astrophysics events being believed to emit neutrinos.

It is run by a five-member commission, appointed by the Mayor and approved by the Board of Supervisors. The Port is responsible for managing the larger waterfront area that extends from the anchorage of the Golden Gate Bridge, along the Marina district, all the way around the north and east shores of the city of San Francisco including Fisherman's Wharf and the Embarcadero, and southward to the city line just beyond Candlestick Point. In 1968 the State of California, via the California State Lands Commission for the State-operated San Francisco Port Authority (est. 1957), transferred its responsibilities for the Harbor of San Francisco waterfront to the City and County of San Francisco / San Francisco Harbor Commission through the Burton Act AB2649. All eligible State port authority employees had the option to become employees of the City and County of San Francisco to maintain consistent operation of the Port of San Francisco. The Port of San Francisco lies on the western edge of the San Francisco Bay near the Golden Gate. It has been called one of the three great natural harbors in the world, but it took two long centuries for navigators from Spain and England to find the anchorage originally called Yerba Buena: a port, as was said in its early days, in which all the fleets of the world could find anchorage. The port area under the Commission's control comprises nearly eight miles of waterfront lands, commercial real estate and maritime piers from Hyde Street on the north to India Basin in the southeast. The list of landmarks under port control include Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, the Ferry Building, Oracle Park (formerly AT&T; Park, SBC Park and Pacific Bell Park), located next to China Basin and Pier 70 at Potrero Point. Huge covered piers on piles jut out into San Francisco bay along much of the waterfront, bordered by the Embarcadero roadway. In 2015, the City, acting through the Port of San Francisco, launched the San Francisco Seawall Earthquake Safety and Disaster Prevention Program (Seawall Program). History San Francisco in 1849. The first landing place on the north-eastern tip of the San Francisco peninsula was a rocky promontory below Telegraph Hill later known as Clarke's Point that jutted into the San Francisco Bay at the line of what is now Broadway and Battery Streets. Yerba Buena Cove swept inland from the subsequently named Clarke's Point to as far as Montgomery Street to the west, and further south and east to Rincon Point at the south of Market area at the foot of Folsom and Spear streets. The founding padres of Mission Dolores and the other northern California missions found the jetty at Clarke's Point a convenient landing for their commerce in hides and tallow. It is the same location where Russian ships anchored to load supplies of meat and grain. Early European visitors were the British Raccoon in 1814 and the French frigate Artemise in 1839. The sloop USS St. Louis, which arrived in 1840, was the first warship to fly the American flag in San Francisco Bay. On July 9, 1846, the sloop USS Portsmouth gave a 21-gun salute and Captain John Berrien Montgomery and his detachment rowed ashore and hoisted the American flag on the Mexican flagpole in the small settlement's plaza, later named Portsmouth Square in honor of the ship. The earliest development of a port in San Francisco, two and a half miles east of the Presidio, was under the Mexican regime, begun in 1835 as the town of Yerba Buena. Before this time, the port at Monterey was considered the official port of entry to California. San Francisco Harbor in 1851. Captain Richardson erected the first abode of a European on the hill overlooking the Bay. He became the first harbor master by appointment of the Governor Mariano Guadaloupe de Vallejo. Whalers took umbrage at the taxes charged by the Mexican governor Manuel Micheltorena in 1843, and the outright banning of their trading in the port, then relocated from San Francisco to the Hawaiian Islands. Commodore John D. Sloat claimed California for the United States on July 7, 1846, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and Captain John B. Montgomery arrived to claim Yerba Buena two days later. In 1847, the first American alcalde, Lt. Washington Allon Bartlett changed the name from Yerba Buena to San Francisco, \\"so that the town may have the advantage of the name given on the public map.\\" The United States governor of the newly occupied territory of California, General Stephen W. Kearny, renounced the rights of eminent domain of the American government in favor of the city of San Francisco. The early city built up on the west side of Yerba Buena Cove around Portsmouth Square. Immediately, the municipality of San Francisco was given the right, by General Kearney acting as governor of California, to sell \\"water lots\\" in the tidelands between Clarke's Point and Rincon Point so the city might gain revenues from the sale. At the same time, the owner of the land at the foot of Telegraph Hill, W. S. Clarke built a timbered wharf and the location became known as Clarke's Point. Later, a substantial wharf long and wide was erected to the depth of water, , made the landing available to deep water ships. this project was followed by other wharves built below Broadway and Clay streets, and at Commercial street. The Shoreline of San Francisco in 1853. When gold was discovered in California, the first hulk of an old iron revenue steamer, the James K. Polk, was beached at the foot of the bluff near Clarke's Point and became the foundation of the first real passenger landing in the city. It was at this site that the population of San Francisco met the Pacific mail liner the Oregon to receive the official announcement that California had been admitted to the Union. The bluff at the point was quickly leveled and on the land created a wharf was built that became the first regular berthing place, for a short time, for the Pacific mail steamships. Whatever products came to California, and whatever California produced, had to be carried by ship. In the first year of the gold rush, hundreds of ships were beached and abandoned in the tidal flats of Yerba Buena Cove, and numerous ships were run aground to become parts of the city itself. In 1853, the Vallejo Street wharf lease was granted, and a larger wharf was built. In the ensuing years, the state legislature passed bills concerning the sale of water lots and authorizing the city to construct wharves beyond its boundary and to set wharfage rates. The battles over control of the waterfront, water lots, and docking privileges began. The great Central Wharf was built in 1849, named for the central wharf in Boston, and was located where Commercial street is now. Eventually a huge forest of masts from a fleet of abandoned vessels filled Yerba Buena Cove. By 1851, the Central Wharf had ten times more business offered than it could handle, and many new wharves were struck into the bay, including those at Market, Sacramento, Washington, California, Clay, Jackson and Pacific Streets. The filling of Yerba Buena Cove and extensive corruption and legislation led to a period, during the gold rush, when major portions of the city were built on water lots, reclaimed by hook or by crook, on pile driven and rough planking overlain. Early San Francisco was a wharf city of planks and sheds and subject to devastating fires. Half the early city was built on trembling wharves and the scrub and sandy hills were not appreciated, amongst them only a few abodes and scattered tents were found. The early wharves and their buildings fell into the bay and by 1857, the waterfront was a jumble of abandoned ships and rickety piers. Businesses looked for more solid facilities. Two wharves of notice projected out into the bay from the foot of Taylor street; McMahon's Wharf, and Meiggs Wharf. They had \\"T\\" and \\"L\\" shaped extensions, the former was a landing for wood and charcoal. The latter, after Harry Meiggs absconded, became the landing for the ferry to Sausalito. Map of San Francisco in 1858. Merchant's (or Cousin's) Dock built and repaired ships at the site that is now Kearney and Bay streets, but it was swallowed up when a new location for the Seawall was established along the cure that is now the Embarcadero. Merchant's Drydock was moved to the foot of Harrison and the company established floating drydocks at Hunter's Point. The North Point dock at the north side of Telegraph Hill was built in 1853 and became the landing site for immigrant ships from Italy and France. Numerous other wharves, privately built and owned, stretched along the northern waterfront; Flint's, the India docks, Cowell's, Shaw's, Law's, Buckelew's, Cunnigham's and the Long Wharf. Many of these wharves were on city lands that might be filled at any time, and most disappeared with the building of the Seawall and the modern piers built into the early twentieth century. Amidst intense disputation over ownership and litigation unparalleled in the history of any port in the world, the establishment of the Board of State Harbor commissioners created a San Francisco waterfront as a separate institution by law, having no connection to the city government and indirectly controlled by the state. Until the 1860s, supplies could also be delivered up Mission Creek by boat to the vicinity of Mission Dolores. = California Board of State Harbor Commissioners = Shoreline of San Francisco in 1869. Chapter 306 of the Statutes of 1863 created the California Board of State Harbor Commissioners and set about the task of building a Seawall on the San Francisco waterfront. The project that would eliminate the patchwork and jagged lines of the waterfront, ending it cleanly at the modern Embarcadero. After four years of litigation, the commissioners offered a thousand dollar prize for the best plan for the San Francisco Seawall. One of the designers of the plan, W.J. Lewis was appointed engineer in chief of the project. Another engineer on the project, T.J. Arnold designed the curving waterfront eventually settled on. A pit or channel in the mudflats was dredged to a depth of below low tide level and huge loads of rock were dumped in from scows and barges at the center line of the trench until they stopped sinking, to make an evenly graded ridge the whole way at the height of mean low tide. The rocks became the foundation for the Seawall. Coffer dams were sunk and forms constructed inside them while constant pumping occurred. A mass of concrete thick and wide was poured over the rocks and a masonry wall seven feet at the base and nine feet high was constructed. The area inside the wall was pumped out and filled with rock, rubble and trash to the city grade. It took the board several years to acquire the leases on private wharves. The opening of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 halted harbor development and the building of the Seawall. The tonnage of vessels arriving at the port dropped by nearly half in the next two years. By 1871, the commissioners could report that they were in possession of all the wharves along the city front except those that bordered Channel Street between Third and Fourth streets. In 1881, the harbor commissioners began contracting for the construction of the San Francisco Seawall. The Seawall would take fifty years before completion of the last sections in the China Basin. Chapter 835 of the Statutes of 1929 created the State operated San Francisco Harbor Bond Finance Board. The 1929 act provided for the issuance and sale of state bonds to create a fund for the improvement of San Francisco Harbor by the California Board of State Harbor Commissioners. Chapter 368 of the Statutes of 1937 changed the name of the commission to the California Board of State Harbor Commissioners for San Francisco Harbor. Chapter 112 of the Statutes of 1957 renamed the commission yet again as the San Francisco Port Authority which still remained under State authority/jurisdiction. Chapter 1333 of the Statutes of 1968 transferred all authority, jurisdiction and control of the San Francisco Port Authority over San Francisco Harbor and facilities to the City and County of San Francisco. Upon the transfer of these authorities, the port authority ceased to function and was dissolved. The newly created Harbor Commission of the City and County of San Francisco assumed responsibility and control. Eventually this commission was renamed yet again Port Commission of the City and County of San Francisco and the Port of San Francisco to this day. =Filling the downtown district= Steam powered machines called \\"paddies\\" were eating away at the sand dunes and rock hills, especially Telegraph Hill, a few blocks west of the filled zone. Rock was also imported from Brooks Island off Point Richmond. Temporary steam train lines carried the earthen fill for dumping onto the mudflats. Both the Ferry Building and the Southern Pacific Building at the foot of Market Street were built upon thousands of Douglas-fir piles, up to deep. =Belt Railroad= Bay Bridge in 1985. In 1890 the port commissioners began developing a series of switchyards and warehouses on the reclaimed land for use of the San Francisco Belt Railroad, a line of over fifty miles that connected every berth and every pier with the industrial parts of the city and railways of America with all the trade routes of the Pacific. For a decade or more, railcar ferry transfers on steamers were the means of carrying railcars to the transcontinental systems. Later, in 1912, the belt line was driven across Market Street in front of the Ferry Building to link the entire commercial waterfront with railways both south and north and across the continent. The line was extended north along Jefferson Street through the tunnel to link up with U.S. Transport Docks at Fort Mason and south to China Basin. Much of the Belt Railroad's right-of-way was removed following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and replaced with streetcar tracks now used by the San Francisco Municipal Railway. The Belt Railroad Engine House and Sandhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 13, 1986. =Embarcadero= The Embarcadero (Spanish: Wharf) is the eastern waterfront and roadway of the Port of San Francisco constructed atop an engineered Seawall on reclaimed land. San Francisco's shoreline historically ran south and inland from Clarke's Point below Telegraph Hill to present-day Montgomery Street and eastward toward Rincon Point, enclosing a cove named Yerba Buena Cove. As the city grew, the cove was filled. Over fifty years a large offshore Seawall was built and the mudflats filled, creating what today is San Francisco's Financial District. The roadway follows the Seawall, a boundary first established in the 1860s and not completed until the 1920s. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 20, 2002. =History of the Embarcadero Seawall= Constructed between 1879 and 1916, the Embarcadero Seawall was built by dredging a trench through the mud, filling that trench with rock and rubble, covering the filled land with a timber pile bulkhead wall and wharf, and then filling the tidal marshland area behind the Seawall. More than 500 acres of land were filled behind the Seawall, extending the footprint of the city. The Seawall acts as a retaining wall for the filled land behind it. The Seawall is the foundation of the Embarcadero Historic District, which includes the bulkhead buildings and finger piers that extend into the Bay. After the Seawall was built, in 1900 alone, six million tons of goods passed through the Port of San Francisco. To support the demand, the Port constructed new piers ‚Äì by 1908, 23 new piers were built. In 1922, with the new Seawall and piers in place, 14.5 million tons of goods passed through the Port of San Francisco. In 1898, the Ferry Building was built and served as the headquarters for the Harbor Commission. Modern developments Pier 5 was renovated and converted to commercial use in 2005. According to port historian Edward Morphy, the achievement of building a great port, \\"was rendered possible solely by the fact that its harbor commissioners, through the succeeding of generations, not only had behind them the credit of the state of California but also were in a position to rise superior to the narrow influences of local politics... The development of the waterfront itself, the Embarcadero, the Seawall and piers, the Belt Railroad and the Seawall lots, could not have been carried out under private or municipal auspices in the manner so beneficial, so efficient, and so economical as is now apparent.\\" With the fire after the 1906 earthquake, a new era of port development began on the San Francisco waterfront. In 1909, the San Francisco Harbor Improvement Act was passed. A total of $9 million was allocated by the state legislature and in 1913, Islais Creek and India Basin lands were purchased. The Board of State Harbor Commissioners began extensive development along the waterfront, always meeting expenses from the revenues of the busy port. Upon completion of the modern piers, odd-numbered to the north of the Ferry Building and even- numbered to the south, the port of San Francisco became the only port in the United States under a single control. The piers were leased to tenants. By the early 1920s, the port's assets were valued at $50 million and $8 to $9 million worth of merchandise and raw goods were handled yearly. In the 1920s and 1930s, numerous old piers on both sides of Market Street were razed and a smaller number of concrete piers with wider slips between them were constructed. The port also built the six-story China Basin Warehouse to bring together ships, rail, and truck for the handling of products. At India Basin, it built a plant to handle vegetable oils. The federal government in 1922 began dredging a 40-foot channel through the Bay's outer bar in at the entrance to the harbor after 1922 and the dredging of Islais Creek with the so-called reclamation of of adjacent creek tidelands. Two graving docks at Hunter's Point that could accommodate the largest ocean-going vessels, five floating drydocks, eight marine railways, four shearleg derricks and ten floating boom derricks were available. In the 1920s, the emergence of Los Angeles as the West Coast's largest city‚Äîand in particular, as its major industrial center‚Äîrelegated the Port of San Francisco to a secondary role. For the next few decades, the port steadily but inexorably lost market share to the twins ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, as well as its crossbay rival Port of Oakland. The advent of containerization in the 1960s effectively sounded the death knell for the Port of San Francisco as a major marine terminal, as it had no room to expand to build a large new container handling facility like the Seventh Street Terminal at the Port of Oakland. A few piers added container handling equipment, but heavy traffic congestion in the area and poor rail access have long militated against the large-scale development of the container trade at the port. Insufficient clearances of rail tunnels and overpasses have also prevented the development of roll-on/roll-off capability at the port. With limited ability to expand physically as a result of environmentalist opposition to further reclamation and the soaring cost of real estate in San Francisco, the Port of San Francisco has instead become a niche player, specializing in break bulk and dry bulk cargo, ship repair, and ferry services. =Cargo terminals= With the advent of containerization and San Francisco's limited real estate, Oakland became the primary Bay Area port in the 1960s. The finger piers located along the northern waterfront quickly became outdated. San Francisco made an attempt to retain cargo capabilities by building new facilities in the southeast corner of the city. San Francisco's limited cargo facilities are located at Pier 80 (, leased to the Pasha Group), 92, 94, and 96. =Ship repair= The drydock located at Pier 70 offers full service ship repair. BAE Systems Ship Repair manages San Francisco's ship repair facility. =Fisherman's Wharf= Fisherman's Wharf in 2009. San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf gets its name and neighborhood characteristics from the city's early days of the mid to later 1800s when Italian immigrant fishermen came to the city by the bay to take advantage of the influx of population due to the gold rush. One in particular, Achille Paladini found it so lucrative he made a fortune wholesaling the local crustaceans and went on to become California's second most wealthy Italian, second to none other than the founder of the Bank of Italy, later to become the Bank of America. He was also a pioneer in developing the fish industry on the west coast and went on to be known as the \\"Fish King.\\" Most of the Italian immigrant fishermen settled in the North Beach area close to the wharf and fished for the local delicacies and the now famed Dungeness crab. From then until the present day it remained the home base of San Francisco's fishing fleet. Despite its redevelopment into a tourist attraction during the 1970s and 1980s, the area is still home to many active fishermen and their fleets. One of the busiest and well known tourist attractions in the western United States, Fisherman's Wharf is best known for being the location of Pier 39, the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park and its adjacent museum, the Cannery Shopping Center, Ghirardelli Square, a Ripley's Believe it or Not museum, the Mus√©e M√©canique, the Wax Museum at Fisherman's Wharf, the floating Forbes Island restaurant, and restaurants and stands that serve fresh seafood, most notably Dungeness crab and clam chowder served in a sourdough bread bowl. =Pier 39= View of Pier 39. Pier 39 was first developed by entrepreneur Warren Simmons and opened October 4, 1978. Pier 39 is a shopping center and popular tourist attraction built on a pier in San Francisco, California. There are shops, restaurants, a video arcade, street performances, an interpretive center for the Marine Mammal Center, the Aquarium of the Bay, virtual 3D rides, and views of California sea lions hauled out on docks on Pier 39's marina. The marina is also home to the floating Forbes Island restaurant. A two-story carousel is one of the pier's more dominant features, although it is not directly visible from the street and sits towards the end of the pier. =Ferry Building= The Ferry Building was renovated in 2003. M/V Del Norte docked at the Ferry Building. The San Francisco Ferry Building was built by the Harbor Commission for less than one million dollars and quickly became one of the most profitable investments in state history. It survived the 1906 earthquake with little damage. In the 1920s, 50 million passengers a year and a great number of automobiles used the ferries. On either side of the ferry slips, bay and river steamers arrived and departed with passengers and produce to and from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. Beyond were wharves for regular coastal steamers bound for Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, British Columbia, Alaska, and ships bound for Hawaii, Central and South America and the Pacific Rim. In 2003, the building reopened after the restoration of major public spaces, as well as renovations for new uses: it has a re-dedicated ferry terminal, an upscale gourmet marketplace in the former baggage area featuring local goods, and upper floors adapted for office use. San Francisco Bay Ferry operates from the Ferry Building and Pier 39 to points in Oakland, Alameda, Bay Farm Island, South San Francisco, and north to Vallejo in Solano County. Golden Gate Ferry is the other ferry operator with service between San Francisco and Marin County. =Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District= The Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District is a Registered Historic District, consisting of Piers 1, 1¬Ω, 3 and 5, and is one of the largest surviving pier complexes along San Francisco's Embarcadero. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 20, 2002. =Historic streetcars= PCC #1076 in front of the Ferry Building. The F Market & Wharves line is operated as a heritage streetcar service, using exclusively historic equipment both from San Francisco's retired fleet as well as from cities around the world. In March 2000, service on the F line began along the new extension to Fisherman's Wharf. The E Embarcadero became San Francisco's second heritage streetcar line in 2016. The line runs along the entire length of the Embarcadero, along existing track used by the F Market & Wharves historic streetcar and the N Judah and T Third Street Muni Metro lines. Initial service will run from Jones Street and Jefferson Street in Fisherman's Wharf to the Caltrain station. The line will be extended west past Aquatic Park and through an unused railroad tunnel to Fort Mason. =Exploratorium= The Exploratorium is a museum in San Francisco that has created over 1,000 participatory exhibits that mix science and art, all of which are made onsite. It is considered by some to be the prototype for participatory museums around the world. On January 2, 2013, the Exploratorium closed its doors to the public at the Palace of Fine Arts and began its move to a new location on Piers 15 and 17 along The Embarcadero. The museum opened to the public at Pier 15 on April 17, 2013. =Cruise Terminal= Star Princess docked at Pier 35. The new James R. Herman Cruise Terminal at Pier 27 opened in August 2014 as a replacement to Pier 35. The modern terminal has electric shore power, larger holding areas, and secure customs screening. Pier 35 had neither the sufficient capacity to allow for the increasing length and passenger capacity of new cruise ships nor the amenities needed for an international cruise terminal. The port currently handles sixty to eighty cruise ship calls and 200,000 passengers and expects an increase to 300,000 in 2015. Itineraries from San Francisco include round trip cruises to Alaska and Hawaii. So far, the Queen Mary 2 is the largest cruise ship that docked in San Francisco. On March 16, 2013, Princess Cruises Grand Princess became the first ship to home port in San Francisco year round. The ship offered cruises to Alaska, California Coasts, Hawaii, and Mexico. In 2018, the Port of San Francisco was expected to meet three cruise ships for the first time: the Silver Explorer, Ponant's Le Sol√©al, and the new Norwegian Bliss that will become the largest ship to visit the city. =Oracle Park= Oracle Park opened in 2000. Oracle Park is a ballpark used for Major League Baseball located in the South of Market neighborhood of San Francisco, California, at 24 Willie Mays Plaza, at the corner of Third and King Streets along the shore of San Francisco Bay. It has served as the home of the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball since 2000. The Giants rent the land from the Port of San Francisco. = Embarcadero Seawall Program = The City, acting through the Port of San Francisco, launched the Embarcadero Seawall Program to improve seismic performance, provide near-term flood protection improvements, and plan for long-term resilience and sea level rise adaptation along the Embarcadero. The rebuild of the Embarcadero Seawall is estimated to cost up to $5 billion and take several decades to complete. The Port is planning an initial phase of improvements to address the highest priority life safety projects. This phase will cost $500 million. Phase I funding will require local, state, and federal funding. Local funding will be provided in part by a voter-approved General Obligation Bond of $425 million, which passed with 82% of the vote in the November 2018 election. Future developments=Pier 70= The port of San Francisco owns extensive filled land at the Pier 70, San Francisco, California, Potrero Point district on the southeast bayfront at 20th Street east of Illinois that holds the greatest example of a 19th-century industrial village remaining in the western US, site of the first industrial iron and steel mills, shipbuilding and manufacturing center in California. The Union Iron Works and Bethlehem Shipbuilding as well as the United States Navy have all had shipworks at the site. The current site is now occupied by BAE Systems Ship Repair and Sims Group. In June 2020, a woman owned business operated by a San Francisco native with extensive business and maritime experience, including 25 years of contracting with the City of San Francisco, filed a claim alleging the company SUSTAP responded to The Port of San Francisco‚Äôs RFP for Lease Operation of the Pier 70 Shipyard. SUSTAP alleges its response was feasible and The Port‚Äôs inaction in the handling of the restart of the Ship Repair facility suggests there was never a true intent to include Ship repair as part of the redevelopment of Pier 70 and that SUSTAP was unfairly used by the Port along the way. Cancelled developments=Warriors Arena= The Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association in 2012 announced the construction of a new arena to be built on Piers 30-32. The 19,000 seat arena would be built near the foot of the Bay Bridge and open by the 2017-18 season. On April 22, 2014 the Warriors announced they abandoned the Pier 30-32 location and have purchased land in the Mission Bay neighborhood for their new arena. =USS Iowa= In 2006 the US Navy approached the city of San Francisco about permanently docking the retired USS Iowa as a floating museum and tourist attraction in Fisherman's Wharf. The Board of Supervisors voted against the idea out of protest of Don't ask, don't tell. In 2012 the battleship opened as a museum at the Port of Los Angeles. =Chelsea Piers= In 2001 the Port planned on converting Piers 27, 29, and 31 into a recreation and athletic facility to be managed by the Chelsea Piers Sports and Entertainment Complex. The planned was shelved and Piers 27 and 29 are now used as the Cruise Terminal.

He was born in the community of Yorkton, near Fredericton in York County, New Brunswick (now Canada, but a British colony at the time). His parents were Isaac Stephenson (1791‚Äì1874), a lumberman and farmer born in Ireland of Scotch-Irish ancestry, and Elizabeth (Watson) Stephenson (?‚Äì1838), who was born in London.Stephenson, Isaac. 1915. Recollections of a Long Life, 1829-1915. Chicago: R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company Lumberman Stephenson worked in lumbering activities in the eastern U.S. for several years, principally in Maine, close to Canada. In 1845 he moved to Wisconsin, where for a time he managed absentee timber properties, but soon entered the lumber business for himself. In 1858 he settled permanently in Marinette, where he steadily expanded his lumbering operations, especially during the Civil War. Although Stephenson suffered heavy losses in the Peshtigo Fire of 1871, he recouped. He was one of the wealthiest lumbermen in the Great Lakes area, with real-estate holdings in Marinette, Green Bay, Milwaukee, and the booming town of Chicago, and throughout the Great Lakes. He also owned vast acreages of pine lands in northern Wisconsin and Michigan which were yet to be harvested. Political career sketch c. 1881 Stephenson joined the Republican Party, which was popular among his class in the northern tier of states. His wealth and economic power made him a powerful figure in local and state politics. He was elected to several offices, including town supervisor, county board chairman, and justice of the peace.History of Marinette \\" City of Marinette, Wisconsin. Next Stephenson was elected as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly (1866, 1868). In 1882, he was elected to the Forty-Eighth Congress, and then reelected to the Forty-Ninth and Fiftieth Congresses (serving March 4, 1883 ‚Äì March 3, 1889). He represented Wisconsin's newly created 9th congressional district. He was not a candidate for re-election in 1888. In 1899 he was unsuccessful in his bid to gain election by the state legislature as a United States Senator from Wisconsin (as was the process at the time). Early Progressive leader In 1900 he threw his support and substantial financial backing behind Robert M. La Follette, Sr., in his campaign for the Wisconsin governorship, and for a number of years was a prominent adviser to the Progressive faction of the Republican party, and a liberal contributor to its campaign funds. In the 1904 progressive-stalwart split, Stephenson was chosen by the \\"gymnasium convention\\" as one of the progressive delegates to the Republican national convention along with La Follette and William D. Connor. Although the national convention refused to accept the credentials of the Progressive delegation, the La Follette forces were recognized as the legal Republican ticket by the Wisconsin Supreme Court (1904). In 1901 Stephenson established the Milwaukee Free Press, providing Progressive-Republicans with a metropolitan newspaper, and competition for the Stalwart-controlled Milwaukee Sentinel. In 1907 Stephenson sought the U.S. Senate seat made vacant by the resignation of John C. Spooner and, after a brief deadlock, was elected by the Progressive- controlled state legislature. In 1908 he ran for renomination in the Republican primary, was opposed by La Follette, but despite this opposition won the nomination through the aid of the state chairman of the Republican party William D. Connor and lavish use of his personal wealth, and was re- elected by the legislature in 1909. Although his election was twice blocked by fraud investigations in both the state legislature and the U.S. Senate, Stephenson was eventually vindicated and resumed his seat in the Senate, serving from May 1907, to March 1915.Stephenson, Isaac 1829-1918. Wisconsin Historical Society. Stephenson holds the distinction of being the oldest elected freshman United States Senator; he was 77 when he took office. Presidential cow In 1909 Stephenson purchased a prized Holstein cow as a gift for the 27th President of the United States, William Howard Taft. The cow was named Pauline Wayne and she became the last presidential pet cow. Pauline Wayne lived and grazed on the White House lawn.Pauline Wayne-Presidential Cow Retirement After returning from Washington in 1915, Stephenson retired to his home in Marinette, where he remained until his death on March 15, 1918. Noted for his local philanthropies in Marinette, a park, street, and memorial library are named in his honor. His younger brother, Samuel Merritt Stephenson, served as a U.S. Representative from Michigan.

The Cem is fully formed at the confluence of its two tributaries the Vuk√´l Cem and the Selc√´ Cem. It passes mostly through limestone terrain with many karstic formations. These features of the Cem's basin have their origin in the tectonic activity of the Alpine orogeny, which formed the Dinaric Alps. The terrain through which it flows in its course, is at an elevation of more than and can reach as low as . It passes through narrow valleys and steep canyons, where waterfalls are formed before it reaches the Zeta plain. As it approaches the Moraƒça, the Cem area shifts from a continental climate to a Mediterranean one. The drainage basin of the Cem encompasses and is part of the Adriatic river basin. The first cultural indicators of human settlement in the Cem river basin are from the late Copper Age and early Bronze Age (3500-2300 BC). Illyrian tribes such as the Labeatae lived in the area in classical antiquity. In the following millennia, the area passed under the control of the Roman Empire and its eastern counterpart, Slavic principalities, the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire. The Cem basin was the home of Albanian tribes (fise) such as Kelmendi, Hoti, Gruda and Triepshi until the 20th century. Today, the river is divided between Albania and Montenegro. The Cem is one of the last free-flowing rivers in Europe. The river's basin is a source of very high biodiversity, and hundreds of plant and animal species live along its banks. Mammals include wild boars, brown bears and red foxes. The river's canyon is an Important Bird Area for species like the short-toed snake eagle and the Levant sparrowhawk. The marble trout is one of the 22 fish species in the river, which consistently ranks as one of the least polluted rivers in Albania and Montenegro. In the 21st century, it is threatened by industrialization, the installation of small hydropower stations and the effects of climate change in Europe.  Name  The Greek geographer Ptolemy was the first to mention the Cem as Kinna in ancient Greek. In Tabula Peutingeriana a location named Cinna in Latin is connected to the river. These two forms are considered to be written forms of a local, Illyrian name Cinua. Albanian Cem and medieval Slavic Cenva and Cemva ultimately stem from this original name of the river. Montenegrin‚Äì and also Bosniak and Serbian ‚Äì Cijevna is derived from Serbo-Croatian cijev (pipe), but other toponyms preserve the older name ƒÜemovsko polje (field of Cem).  Geography  The Cem at Kelmend The Cem originates in Kelmend, Mal√´si e Madhe, Albania and flows through the region of Mal√´sia. The river has two tributaries: the Vuk√´l Cem (Cemi i Vuklit) and the Selc√´ Cem (Cemi i Selc√´s), which join at the confluence of Tamar√´. The Vuk√´l Cem ‚Äì the more important of the two in terms of water volume ‚Äì rises at above sea level and flows for . It passes through a narrow canyon, a terrain which widens only near Kozhnja, where deposition has formed a small limestone valley. A creek called the Nik√ß Cem (Cem i Nik√ßit) contributes to its volume in the rainy period. A small hydropower project has been built where the Cem i Nik√ßit passes through Kozhnja. The Selc√´ Cem rises at on Mount Bordolec near L√´push√´ and flows for mostly through narrow limestone terrain until it reaches the valley of Tamar√´. In its course it passes through the Gropat e Selc√´s karstic caves, the canyon of Gerrlla, long and deep, and the waterfall of Sllapi before reaching Dobrinj√´. The Cem then flows to the southwest for before crossing into Montenegro, near the village of Grabom. The Albania-Montenegro border crossing is located ca. west of Grabom. In Montenegro, the river flows through the villages of Tuzi for before it flows into the Moraƒça, just south of Podgorica. The terrain through which the river flows in Montenegro is divided into two parts. Firstly, it forms a steep canyon and then slowly crosses into the Zeta plain, of which a part is called ƒÜemovsko polje after the river. On the plain, ≈†piro Mugo≈°a Airport has been built between the Cem and the Ribnica to the east of Podgorica Airport. The land here has become more urbanized and industrialized. The Cem canyon (Kanjon Cijevne/Kanioni i Cemit) is long and has a depth of . It is the natural habitat of many animal, insect and plant species. The canyon starts at the Albania-Montenegro border and forms a distinct geomorphological formation that crosses into ƒÜemovsko polje just before the village of Dinosha.  Geology  Geomorphology of the Dinaric Alps. Cem is found in the Prokletije/Albanian Alps subdivision in B31 The geomorphological features of the Cem basin have their origin in the tectonic activity of the Alpine orogeny, which has been forming the Dinaric Alps and its southern range, the Prokletije since the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic era. The Cem basin is in the High Karst Unit. In this sub-unit, tectonic activity lifts the landmasses vertically and carbonate rocks form a large part of the landscape, which is defined by fluvial processes like the deposition of carbonate sediments by the river caused by the flow of the river. As the Prokletije have had glacial features, thus a high accumulation of water, the end of the Ice Age saw a general increase of the Cem's discharge, which in turn increased fluvial processes in the basin. An abundance of limestone has enabled the formation of uvalas, caves and other karst formations. However, water is retained in limestone, and so the denudation of geological formations is decreasing. The result of these interconnected processes is that the Cem flows mostly through elevated, vertical and steep terrain, which forms canyons and crosses into small valleys. In these places, such as in the valley of Tamara, non-carbonate rocks have caused horizontal erosion to occur. Then, the river exits high elevation areas and flows towards the Moraƒça as the relief flattens and a polje is formed by karst processes.  Drainage basin  The drainage basin of the Cem is a part of the Adriatic river basin, along with other rivers that empty into Lake Skadar, a total area of . The river and its tributaries originate within the of the basin that are within the borders of Albania; are in Montenegro. To the north, it borders the basin of the Vermosh and to the east that of the L√´push√´. To the south, the Cem's basin ends near Bog√´. The river flows from above to no more than . In Montenegro, waterfalls more than high are formed. Annual precipitation is about . The month with highest precipitation is November () and the driest month is July (). Snowfall can be observed as late as May. There is on average a 40-day period of annual snowfall and an accumulation average of . The Cem has a continental climate in its upper part and a Mediterranean one as it reaches the Moraƒça. The annual temperature averages 6.8-7 ¬∞C - January being the coldest month at -3 ¬∞C and July the hottest at 15.7-20 ¬∞C. Water temperatures range from 5 ¬∞C in the spring to 13 ¬∞C in the summer. There are three local winds that affect the Cem in Albania. The Murlani is a dry and cold northern and northeastern wind which blows towards the Adriatic, whereas the Shiroku and the Juga are humid and warm southern winds which are associated with rainy periods.  Discharge  The river's streamflow increases as tributaries and springs flow into it. Elevation and other morphological features also cause variations in its discharge. In general, the upper part of the Cem in Albania has a lower velocity and thus a lower streamflow than the flow of the Cem through the canyon in Montenegro, where the Cem's streamflow increases as it descends. When it reaches the Zeta plain, it slows again as it flows into the Moraƒça. The Cem of Vuk√´l contributes to the river. Measurements at Tamar√´, where the confluence with Cem of Selc√´ is located, show an average discharge of . As the river passes into Montenegro near Grabom, karstic springs in at Dverbta and Brezhda increase its streamflow. After this point the average discharge through the canyon is , but as it crosses into the valley, it can drop below in the dry summer months. The maximal discharge rate of the river has been observed in May at . Causes of the flow decrease include its use in the water supply network and environmental factors linked to climate change, which has led to a cyclical decrease of rainfall, groundwater and karstic springs water yield to the river. This trend of flow decrease was observed in the Trgaj measurement station near Dinosha, in 2019, where the summer flow was at a very low . As the Cem pours into the Moraƒça, it can contribute up to to the total discharge of of that river into Lake Shkodra.  Ecosystem  The Levant sparrowhawk (Accipiter brevipes) breeds in the river's canyon The ecosystem of the Cem river basin is very biodiverse. The riparian zones of the Cem support hundreds of plant and animal species endemic to the region. Mammals include wild boars, brown bears red foxes, brown hares, pine martens and the - until recently - endangered Eurasian otter. The total number of mammal species in the Cem valley has not yet been completely surveyed. Many bird species live on the banks of the Cem and the river's canyon is an Important Bird Area. Short- toed snake eagles, Levant sparrowhawks and the rock partridge use the canyon for breeding and nesting in the summer months. The Egyptian vulture, an endangered species - once very common in the Balkans - lived in the canyon until 1997, when it became extinct there as in many other areas in the Balkans. In Albania, 130 bird species in total have been identified along the Cem and its tributaries. There are 22 species of fish in the river including endemic marble trout and eel. The height of the Cem above sea level affects flora distribution zones. At elevations between oak trees are common around Selc√´ and Vuk√´l, but as elevation drops pomegranates become much more common. In the river basin about 40% of the total plant species found in Albania, have been identified. In the Cem canyon, 813 plant species have been identified, with a total of 959 in the wider canyon area. The canyon is host to a quarter of the total plant species of Montenegro. A full identification of the flora of the Cem has yet to be completed. In 2018, the moss species Fissidens fontanus was identified for the first time in the part of the river in Montnegro, near Podgorica and in the nearby Sitnica river.  Environmental issues  Until the 1990s, Kelmendi's geographical position as a heavily guarded border zone and lack of industrial development preserved the Cem's ecosystem. Ecological indicators and water quality assessment have consistently shown that the Cem is one of the least polluted rivers in the country. While in the post-1990 transition era there were no adequate monitoring stations, since 2008-2010 environmental monitoring has become more frequent. Within Albania, in recent years, the Cem's ecosystem and very high biodiversity have been threatened by the planned installation of 14 small hydropower plants. As of 2020, construction of two units has begun, in Muras (2 MW) and Dobrinj√´ (1 MW), both along the Cem of Selc√´. In Kelmend, locals have protested strongly against the projects as water used for irrigation will be significantly reduced, and the impact o the ecosystem will endanger ecologically sustainable development in the entire area. In Podgorica, after protests by environmental activists, the Montenegrin government requested full documentation of the Strategic Impact Assessment of the proposed hydropower plants on the river flow as both countries have signed the Espoo Convention, which requires transnational consultation on projects that impact natural resources across borders. The Albanian government has declared that the river's flow towards Montenegro will not be affected. The same process of hydropower expansion is also planned for many of the free-flowing rivers of the Balkans including Moraƒça, where the Cem debouches. In Montenegro, the river is ranked as one of the cleanest rivers in the country. As in Albania, before the 1990s, the part nearest to the border was heavily militarized and no activity was allowed in its vicinity. The municipality of Podgorica declared the river canyon a \\"natural monument\\" in 2017. Environmental organizations argue that despite their formal commitment to protect the river's basin, Montenegrin authorities have consistently allowed sewage pollution, gravel exploitation and unauthorized construction. In the lower part, beyond the canyon, industrialized agriculture and the Podgorica landfill have contributed to the deterioration of surrounding land quality. After the split of Tuzi from Podgorica, across which the Cem flows, the municipality of Tuzi voted in 2018 in favor of a resolution on the protection of the river. As a result of climate change inflow and outflow from the Cem steadily decreased during the 2010s.  Economy  Economic activities and development in settlements in Cem's basin are deeply affected by the ecosystem of the river. Communities along the river rely on agriculture, livestock and alpine forestry. Small-scale, sustainable trout farming has developed in recent years. In Albania, Kelmend was before the 1990s a key area of wood production. In Montenegro, soil fertility of the river basin has allowed viticulture to develop. Planta≈æe owns on the banks of Cem one of the largest vineyards in the region with around 11.5 million grapevines. Seasonal workers cross the border in the season of the year when farming and forestry require extra workforce. The collapse of the economies of the Eastern Bloc had a profound economic effect upon both countries. Many agricultural cooperatives shut down and public services deteriorated during the 1990s and 2000s. As a result, there is a heavy migration flow towards Italy, Greece and particularly the US, where a large community from Tuzi and Mal√´sia lives in Detroit. In Kelmend, a slow and gradual reorganization of the economy happened in the 2000s and 2010s with an orientation towards ecologically sustainable development. Medicinal agriculture and alpine tourism were developed, which have become an important source of income for many villages.  History  Figurine from Rakiƒáa Kuƒáe, 3500-2300 BC Human activity in the Cem basin has been recorded since the late Copper Age. The tumulus of Rakiƒáa Kuƒáe in Tuzi contained nine skeletons and clay figurines with some anthropomorphic attributes. The area of Tuzi remained settled in the Bronze Age. Tumuli and burial artifacts have been found around Dinosha and Lopari in the period that ranges from the Bronze Age to the Hellenistic Period. Illyrian tribes lived in the Cem river basin in classical antiquity. The best known in recorded history are the Labeatae and Docleatae. Artefacts from this era have been excavated in Selc√´, where a hoard of coins that were minted by king Gentius (181-168 BC) was found. Reports on these findings were first published by the archaeologist Arthur Evans in 1880. During the Roman period, the Cem region served as a route between the urbanized centers of the Roman Balkans in the province of Praevalitana. Water from the river was transported to Doclea to supply local Roman townships from the 1st to the 6th century AD. Some traces of fortifications from this era remain. The 6th century historian Procopius mentions the fort Clementiana which may be connected to modern-day Kelmend. The fort system was created after the Ostrogothic invasion of Dalmatia in the late 5th century, which turned former Praevalitana into a border area of the Eastern Roman Empire. Justinian secured the area in the Gothic War in 535. Avar-Slavic raids and incursions caused the destruction of many post-Roman routes and urban centers. The Slavic state of Duklja emerged in the 11th century in the region and later became part of Ra≈°ka and the Serbian Empire. The Venetian Republic appeared as the dominant force in the late 14th century. Until the consolidation of Ottoman rule in the 15th century, the Zeta plain and the Cem were a borderland between Venice, the Principality of Zeta and local Albanian tribes (fise) and rulers. The Albanian fis pattern of settlements on the banks of the Cem continued in the Ottoman period and even after the division of the river between Montenegro and Albania in the Balkan Wars. The Ottomans placed the Cem area under the jurisdiction of the Sanjak of Scutari to control the Catholic clans of Mal√´sia. Nevertheless, in practice local communities were semi- autonomous throughout the era. The Selc√´ Cem and the Vuk√´l Cem formed part of the territory of the Kelmendi tribe. As Cem passes into modern Montenegro in Grabom, the settlements of right-bank Cem were part of Triepshi. The villages of left-bank Cem were part of Hoti and beyond that point, the area belonged to Gruda. Historical accounts of the Cem increased in the second half of the 19th century as the political rivalry of the Great Powers affected the region and the Principality of Montenegro expanded into Ottoman territory. The Congress of Berlin in 1878 awarded Triepshi to Montenegro but this decision was met with resistance there, as was the ultimately annulled annexation of Tuzi by Montenegro, so the border area remained undefined until the Balkan Wars. For the next 30 years the Cem basin was fought over by the Ottomans, the Montenegrin Principality and the Albanian national movement, with ever- changing tactical alliances between those forces due to the involvement of Great Powers, Austria and Russia. Of the many campaigns, battles and skirmishes of that period, the battle on the hill of De√ßiq in the Albanian revolt of 1911 against the Ottomans is marked as one the better known and important events. It is possibly the first time during which the Albanian flag was hoisted in battle since the 15th century. It was hoisted by Ded Gjo Luli of Hoti. The London Peace Conference of 1912-1913 set the Albanian-Montenegrin border which remains to this day the boundary that divides the Cem. Part of the population from the villages around the Cem that became part of Montenegro, moved to Albania in the years that followed the demarcation and founded villages like Hot i Ri (New Hoti) in 1932 and Gruda e Re (New Gruda) in 1930 across the border near Shkod√´r, in the area which is now known as Rrethinat. In 1941, the Montenegrin part of the Cem basin was placed under Albanian control by Fascist Italy as part of its campaign to gain local support for its protectorate over Albania. After the war, the 1912-1913 demarcation line was re-established as the border between the two countries.  Settlements  Tuzi municipality The Cem traverses the Kelmend and Tuzi municipalities in Albania and Montenegro respectively as well as some settlements in Podgorica municipality (Mitroviƒái, Mojanoviƒái, Mahala, and Ljajkoviƒái). Kelmend has a population of about 3,000, Tuzi 12,000 and the total population of the settlements near Podgorica is about 4,700. Kelmend is Albanian and Catholic. In Tuzi, two thirds of the population are Catholic Albanians and some are Muslim Albanians, while the rest are Orthodox Montenegrins and Muslim Bosniaks. In Mitroviƒái, Mojanoviƒái, Mahala and Ljajkoviƒái about 85% are Orthodox Montenegrins and 15% Orthodox Serbs. Over the years, the Cem basin has experienced heavy migration towards Europe and the USA. The two principal municipalities of the area, Kelmend and Tuzi, have been greatly affected by the population drain of emigration. The urban agglomeration of Podgorica is spreading towards where the Cem meets the Moraƒça. The Cem's significance in the region is reflected in the use of the river as a symbol of both state institutions and non-state organizations. Tuzi municipality uses the river in its flag and in Ljajkoviƒái, the local football club (FK Bratstvo Cijevna) is named after it.

He lives in Berlin. Early career He was educated at The Junior Kings School and St Edmund's School, Canterbury and the Royal Academy of Music. Taking up the piano at the age of four under Ronald Smith, Kempf first caught the attention of British concertgoers four years later when he played Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 12 with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall. The child virtuoso was shortly invited to Germany to repeat his performance. In 1987, Kempf won the first National Mozart Competition in England and in 1992, was named BBC Young Musician of the Year for his performance of Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. He won the Young Concert Artists International Auditions in 1996 which led to his New York City recital debut at Carnegie Hall. Later career Kempf's early adult career benefited from his failure to win the 1998 International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, where the first prize in the piano section went instead to Denis Matsuev. Apparently, some judges had wanted to award the first prize jointly to Matsuev and Kempf, and had successfully negotiated with the Russian Culture Ministry for the additional funding. However, Kempf only collected the third prize in the end, which provoked a barrage of indignant protests from both the audience and the Russian press, who accused some of the judges of bias, especially towards contestants who also happened to be their former pupils. In April 1999, Kempf returned to Moscow with a series of television broadcasts and sold-out concerts. His popularity has been compared with that garnered by American pianist Van Cliburn who, in a different result in 1958, had won the inaugural competition. Kempf has continued to perform solo, chamber and concertante music in Europe, the Americas, East Asia and Australia, and has recorded recital discs of Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff and Schumann. He was voted Best Young British Classical Performer in the Classical BRIT Awards in 2001. In 2000 he formed the Kempf Trio, with Pierre Bensaid (violin) and Alexander Chaushian (cello). The trio has been well received in Europe, as well as in their international concerts. Now London-based, they have appeared at the Flanders Festival in Belgium and in France at the Orpheus & Bacchus Festival. The ensemble made its United States debut in the chamber music series at La Jolla, California, and in Scottsdale, Arizona. In an April 2000 interview with Kempf, MusicWeb-International's Marc Bridle wrote, > \\"Unlike many musicians of his age, Kempf has a startlingly mature interest > in chamber music\\", quoting Kempf as saying, \\"With the piano it's very easy > for your life to become very solitary. You're always the soloist, or you > tell the conductor what to do. And with recitals it's the same, you just do > what you want. ... It's nice to sit in a chamber group and be told 'you're > playing rubbish', or to be told what to do. ... For me it's one of the most > fulfilling mediums to play in. Especially with the piano trio you can be as > selfish as you want with each instrument treated as a solo.\\" Bridle went on to note, \\"His craving for chamber music came from the Marlboro Festival\\", and cited Kempf recalling that, \\"I remember being told I'd have to rehearse the Mozart Piano Trio on the first day. [‚Ä¶] All of these people were there and they just wanted to play chamber music. Even if you played with the cellist of the Guarneri Quartet, who had played with Rubinstein and had played the piece more than 200 or 300 times, you always felt comfortable. If you had a valid idea they would listen to you, it was just a wonderful experience\\". Bridle added, \\"At no time during our interview does Kempf seem more at ease than when talking about chamber music\\".

In the time of the Third Reich, he occupied various positions in Nazi cultural institutions.  Life  A schoolteacher's son, Blunck was born in Altona near Hamburg and studied law at the University of Kiel and the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg. At the latter university Blunck earned his PhD in 1912 with the dissertation Die Anefangsklage. Eine rechtsgeschichtliche Studie. He was called into the forces in the First World War and served as an officer. Between 1920 and 1928, he worked as a government adviser, and from 1925 until 1928 as a syndic at the University of Hamburg. Blunck lived from 1919 to 1924 in the Vierbergen district of Ahrensburg and later lived in Hoisdorf. In 1931, Blunck moved to his estate \\"M√∂lenhoff\\" in Grebin near Pl√∂n. Between 1920 and 1940, Blunck published many novels and narratives, which are regarded in modern times as an attempt to establish the way to National Socialism. Blunck was especially interested in Nordic themes and Hanseatic history, which he framed with an emphasis on nationalistic aspects and the \\"v√∂lkisch\\" body of thought. His work includes conflicts with the Germanic pantheon, Norse sagas, fairy tales, ghost stories and Low Saxon poetry. After Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power, Blunck was chosen on 7 June 1933 to be the second chairman of the Section for Poetry of the Prussian Academy of the Arts; the first chairman was Hanns Johst. Blunck had before this taken up one of the posts left open after all Jewish members had been excluded. In 1933, Blunck was ordered to take the post of the first President of the Reich Literature Chamber (Reichsschrifttumskammer), whose job was to further the control and Gleichschaltung of literary production and distribution. Blunck signed the \\"vow of most faithful allegiance\\" to Adolf Hitler in the same year. However, by October 1935, he was removed from this position at Hans Hinkel's instigation. Unlike his successor Johst, Blunck was not yet a member of the NSDAP (Nazi Party) and spoke out against persecution of Jews who served in World War I. Blunck was named foreign representative of the Reich Literature Chamber and Honorary \\"Chairman by Seniority.\\" In 1936, Blunck founded the \\"Foundation of German Works Abroad\\" (\\"Stiftung Deutsches Auslandswerk\\"), whose goal was to propagate a positive picture of the Third Reich abroad. He joined the Nazi party in 1937. Blunck became a member of the \\"Eutiner Dichterkreis\\", one of the most ardent Nazi poet societies in the Third Reich, whose patron was Hinrich Lohse (other members were Gunnar Gunnarsson, Helene Voigt-Diederichs, and Gustav Frenssen). Blunck was first president, and then from 1940 forward, he served as honorary president of the foundation, which in consultation with Reich ministries and NSDAP organizations coordinated foreign-based German companies' activities. In 1952, Blunck published his memoirs under the title Unwegsame Zeiten (\\"Pathless Times\\"). He died on 24 April 1961. Quotations Literature  * J√ºrgen Blunck: Bibliographie Hans Friedrich Blunck.

She is best known as the mother of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Descent Lucilla was the daughter of Domitia Lucilla Maior (Maior is Latin for the Elder) and the patrician Publius Domitius Calvisius Tullus Ruso and was a niece to Gnaeus Domitius Lucanus. The maternal grandfather of the younger Lucilla, Lucius Catilius Severus was twice consul and became city Prefect. Lucilla's father served as consul in AD 109 and the date of his second consulship is unknown. Lucilla through her mother had inherited a great fortune, which included a tile and brick factory near Rome, close to the river Tiber. The factory provided bricks to some of Rome's most famous monuments including the Colosseum, Pantheon and the Market of Trajan, and exported bricks to France, Spain, North Africa and all over the Mediterranean. Marriage Lucilla married Marcus Annius Verus, a praetor, who came from a wealthy senatorial family. Verus' sister Faustina the Elder was a Roman Empress and married the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius. Verus was a nephew to Roman Empress Vibia Sabina and his maternal grandmother was Salonina Matidia (niece of Roman Emperor Trajan). With Verus, she had two children, a son, the future Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (26 April 121) and a daughter Annia Cornificia Faustina (122/123 ‚Äì between 152 and 158). Widowhood In 124, her husband died. Her children were raised by herself and they were adopted by her father-in-law. Marcus Aurelius would later inherit the tile and brick factory. In Lucilla's household, the future Roman Emperor Didius Julianus was educated and through her support he was able to start his legal career. Lucilla was a lady of considerable wealth and influence. In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius describes her as a 'pious and generous' person who lived a simple life (1.3n). She spent her final years living with her son in Rome.

Dating from around 1720, the house is believed to be the second oldest in Iya. (The oldest, nearby Kimura House, is designated an Important Cultural Property) Chiiori preserves its original structure, irori Âõ≤ÁÇâË£è floor hearths, and pine floors blackened by hundreds of years of smoke from the irori. The house is unusual for farm houses in Japan because there are no ceilings (except over the small sleeping rooms). This was because for much of the Edo period, tobacco was a leading crop of Iya, and villagers used to hang the tobacco up in the rafters to smoke over the irori. Due to the lack of ceilings, Chiiori has a dramatic wide-open interior. Purchased by Alex Kerr in 1973, Chiiori features in Alex's book Lost Japan. Originally there was no road up to the house, so the only access was to walk an hour from the Iya River road below. Today there's a winding one-lane road access to the house. It is now the center of Chiiori Trust (a non-profit organization based in Iya Valley that is working toward solutions to the problems surrounding depopulation in rural Japan), and Chiiori Alliance (a company dedicated to the same goals). From 1997 to 2007, Kerr shared ownership of Chiiori with Mason Florence. However, in summer of 2007, Kerr bought back Florence's share and since then Alex and the Chiiori Trust / Chiiori Alliance have managed the house. In 2012, Chiiori underwent a major restoration. Over the course of a year, the roof was re-thatched, walls and underfloor structure redone with damage repaired, earthquake protection incorporated, and amenities built in, such as plumbing, bath, toilets, lighting, and heating systems etc. However, most of these changes are invisible, and the thatch, irori, and old pine floors are as they've always been. Working as a consultant for Miyoshi City, of which Iya is a part, Alex went on to restore eight other thatched houses in the hamlet of Ochiai, further up the valley from Chiiori. Today Chiiori Alliance manages all nine houses as places for people to stay and for cultural events.

She is based on child murderer Susan Smith. 'OZ' PEN IS MIGHTIER Prison drama continues to be one of TV's best,\\" New York Daily News (July 11th 2000). Character overview \\"Prisoner 97B642. Convicted December 6, 1997 - Murder in the first degree. Sentence: Death. Sentence commuted in 1999, then commutation of sentence revoked in 2000.\\" Shirley Bellinger is the first and only woman to be incarcerated at Oswald. She was sentenced to die for murdering her daughter; she drove her car into a lake with her daughter in the back seat, then swam out as the car sank, leaving her daughter to drown. She swears it was an accident, but that it nevertheless \\"had to happen\\". While she keeps mostly to herself and has a shy, charming demeanor, she shows some signs of psychological instability; shortly after her arrival, she exposes herself to fellow prisoner Timmy Kirk and prostitutes herself to inmates and guards alike in return for preferential treatment. She believes she is doing God's will, and it is suggested that she is a devout Christian. Along with James Robson, Bellinger is one of two regulars who do not live in Emerald City. Fictional history=Season 2= Bellinger arrives on Death Row and comments on how \\"comfortable\\" her new home is to Warden Glynn. While on Death Row, she flashes her vulva to Timmy Kirk who is on mop duty. Father Mukada visits Bellinger on Death Row in an effort to see her state of mind. She opens up to Mukada about how she was not a religious person growing up and that her first husband was Jewish and her second husband Zeke was an atheist. She then makes a pass at Mukada by commenting on how his collar is on too tight. Mukada gets nervous and immediately tells her to stop. She then breaks down and cries. Later, she sees Diane Wittlesey pass on through. Bellinger asks Wittlesey to be her friend and is rejected, and Wittlesey asks Bellinger how she could live with herself after what she has done. Bellinger replies that she did what she had to do and that she is able to sleep. She then puts her hand on Wittlesey's hand in a gesture of sympathy. She exchanges a series of pornographic letters with a \\"secret admirer\\" from within her cell block. When her pen pal turns out to be fellow inmate Simon Adebisi, who exposes himself to her and demands fellatio, she rejects him because he is black, sending him off with a racial slur. =Season 3= Bellinger is joined by Richie Hanlon. She asks him to expose himself to her and does not care if he is a homosexual. Bellinger and Hanlon grow close, and she is seen making a sweater for him. When Bellinger sees Hanlon and Vernon Schillinger get into a growling match, she gets worried and asks Hanlon why the two men hate each other. Hanlon explains that Schillinger is the reason he is on death row. Willing to help Hanlon, she tells him to go to the judge and say that both he and Schillinger killed Alexander Vogel together. Before Hanlon goes to see the judge, they say their goodbyes. Before lights out, she sees an empty cell and assumes that Hanlon got his death sentence overturned. She unknits the sweater she made for him, realizing she will never see him again. Bellinger loses her final appeal and is apparently at peace with her impending death. She enlists the help of Tim McManus, who tells her Hanlon has been murdered and promises he will find out who did it. Bellinger chooses hanging as her method of execution. She tells McManus that she's on his side of the sexual harassment suit against Claire Howell. Soon afterward, however, she learns that she is pregnant by an unknown partner. As prison psychologist \\"Sister Pete\\" Reimondo examines her, Bellinger tells the nun why she killed her daughter: she saw \\"orbs of fire\\" surrounding her and even saw a plate levitate. Bellinger insists that she has to die. Sister Pete recommends to Governor James Devlin that Bellinger be institutionalized, and Devlin then commutes Bellinger's death sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Furious, Bellinger tells Reimondo that the nun betrayed her and demands an abortion, or she will kill \\"this monster inside of me\\". As Sister Pete is telling Bellinger she will be sent to the Connelly Institute for the Criminally Insane and will be under 24-hour watch, Bellinger screams that Satan fathered her child, and she is \\"the Virgin Mother\\". =Season 4= After miscarrying the baby under mysterious circumstances, Bellinger returns to Oz. As she is walking on death row, she notices that there are three new inmates and one of them is in her old cell. She asks inmate Nat Ginzburg if he will switch cells with her; he declines. She begins to have sex with guard Len Lopresti. As her execution date nears, Bellinger's ex-husband, Zeke, visits her and offers forgiveness. Angered, she tells him she killed their daughter because she was raped by Zeke's father and Katie was actually Zeke's half-sister. Furious, Zeke punches her in the face, knocking out a tooth. Her execution date arrives, and she assures everyone around her she is ready to die. She talks to Moses Deyell and Ginzburg one last time, telling them she woke up with a crick in her neck and her final meal was a SlimFast milkshake. As Warden Leo Glynn and Father Ray Mukada arrive, she tells Glynn that Lopresti comes into her cell every night and has sex with her (which Lopresti denies) and tells Mukada that the father of her child is Satan in the form of a man. Mukada asks which man to which she gives him a hint \\"neither rain nor snow\\". Mukada recognizes this as a part of the motto for the U.S. Postal Service and suspects Aryan leader Vernon Schillinger is the father because he is in charge of the mail service in Oz but Schillinger denies it. As she is led to the gallows, however, her survival instinct kicks in, and she violently resists her guards, begging not to be hanged. She is eventually subdued and executed as planned. Later in the series, her character narrates an episode of season 6. =Murders committed= * Katie Bellinger - Drove through a river, then Shirley swam out the water and left her daughter to drown in the sinking car.

Rosen served for 23 years as one of the top officials of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). He is often singled out in writings about AIPAC. He was indicted in August 2005 for alleged violations of the Espionage Act, but charges were dropped. The case received attention because it raised new issues about the conflict between US national security policy and civil liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment. Attorney Floyd Abrams said the AIPAC case \\"is the single most dangerous case for free speech and free press\\"Washington Post, March 31, 2006 and Alan Dershowitz called it \\"the worst case of selective prosecution I have seen in 42 years of legal practice.\\"Jerusalem Post, January 31, 2006 In an interview with a journalist from The New Yorker, Rosen pointed to a napkin he was carrying, \\"‚ÄúYou see this napkin? In 24 hours, we could have the signatures of 70 Senators on this napkin‚Äù. On November 3, 2008, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported that Rosen was working for the Middle East Forum (MEF), a think tank directed by scholar Daniel Pipes. Rosen blogged on the MEF website, devoted to Obama Administration personnel and policy. In November 2008, Rosen published \\"Did Iran Offer a 'Grand Bargain' in 2003?,\\" and gave a presentation for MEF titled \\"Wishful Thinking and Iran.\\"  Early career  Rosen taught political science and international relations from 1968 to 1978 at the University of Pittsburgh, Brandeis University and Australian National University. He was coauthor (with Walter S. Jones) of The Logic of International Relations, a best selling textbook that went through four editions from 1974 through 1982. From 1978 to 1982, he served as Associate Director of the National Security Strategies Program at think tank RAND Corporation, conducting and supervising research and analysis of classified material under contract with the Pentagon and the US State Department.  AIPAC  In 1982, Rosen left RAND to join AIPAC, where he served until 2005 as Director of Foreign Policy Issues and was particularly involved in communication with the executive branch including the State Department and the National Security Council. Rosen is regarded as a major contributor to the growth of AIPAC's influence on the US' Middle East policy during. The New York Times said, \\"Mr. Rosen, AIPAC's director of foreign policy issues, is ... one of the group's most influential employees, with wide-ranging contacts within the Bush administration and overseas.\\" The Washington Post wrote, \\"Rosen has been a mainstay of AIPAC and the architect of the group's ever-increasing clout.\\" National Public Radio called him \\"A larger-than-life figure\\" (May 20, 2005) who \\"helped shape AIPAC into one of the most powerful lobby groups in the country\\" (September 30, 2005). Haaretz said, \\"In the eyes of many, he is AIPAC itself.\\" In particular, \\"Rosen helped pioneer 'executive-branch lobbying,' a style of advocacy that was not widespread when he began it in the mid-1980s, but is now a routine complement to the more traditional lobbying of Congress\\" according to the Washington Post. The Nation said Rosen is \\"a brilliant and, some say, ruthless bureaucratic infighter at the country's premiere Mideast lobbying group, who was emboldened by his long relationships with figures in and around the Bush Administration and the Washington scene to behave almost as an unofficial diplomatic entity in his own right\\" (July 14, 2005). \\"The special relationship between the US executive branch and AIPAC was the triumph of twenty years of work by ‚Ä¶ Rosen.\\" Rosen's early work with the executive branch focused on expanding military cooperation between the United States and Israel. Rosen authored reports such as The Strategic Value of Israel (1982) and Israel and the U.S. Air Force (1983). Columnist William Safire and defense correspondent Drew Middleton credited one of Rosen's reports with helping to launch the U.S.‚ÄìIsraeli dialogue that resulted in the Strategic Cooperation Agreement during early the Ronald Reagan administration. The Washington Post later said (June 14, 1991): \\"[Rosen] helped convince key members of the Reagan administration that the Jewish state was a U.S. 'strategic asset' in the struggle with the Soviets. ‚Ä¶ Rosen helped encourage more cooperation than the two countries had ever enjoyed.\\" A New Yorker profile (July 4, 2005) said: \\"Rosen used his contacts to carry AIPAC‚Äôs agenda to the White House. An early success came in 1983, when he helped lobby for a strategic cooperation agreement between Israel and the United States, which was signed over the objections of Caspar Weinberger, the Secretary of Defense, and which led to a new level of intelligence sharing and military sales.\\" The Times said (July 6, 1987), \\"AIPAC cannot take sole credit. ‚Ä¶ But Mr. Rosen has reportedly worked to flesh out the strategic cooperation. ‚Ä¶ Despite initial opposition in the Pentagon, the relationship has become institutionalized.\\" Reagan praised AIPAC‚Äôs involvement in helping to build the strategic relationship, in a May 13, 1988 open letter: \\"Probably none [of your achievements] is more important than the developing strategic cooperation between Israel and the United States. We could not have been nearly so successful in building this new tie between our countries without your inspiration and strong support.\\" A major focus of Rosen's efforts in the 1990s was Iran. Rosen and his codefendant in the AIPAC/Franklin case Keith Weissman were among the first to advocate a strategy of graduated American economic sanctions for leverage against Iran's alleged involvement in sponsoring terrorism and its purported acquisition of nuclear weapons capabilities. Milestones in this campaign were President Bill Clinton's March 14, 1995 Executive Order banning Conoco from investing in Iranian oil and gas production; his May 8, 1995 Executive Order extending this to all U.S. companies; and enactment of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA) on August 4, 1996. The Executive Orders and ILSA (later the Iran Sanctions Act) were the foundation of a Bush Administration effort to get multilateral cooperation for stepped up economic pressure to end the Iranian uranium enrichment program. Another key issue in Rosen's work for AIPAC was U.S. policy toward the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. Rosen was an ardent proponent of the view that U.S. recognition of and relations with Palestinian organizations should be conditioned on their renunciation of terror and violence, their willingness to make peace and their compliance with signed agreements. Rosen also argued, in a 1985 AIPAC monograph titled \\"The Importance of the West Bank and Gaza to the Security of Israel\\", that U.S.-brokered negotiations over territory and borders should include provisions to secure Israel from threats that might arise in areas under Palestinian control. At the height of the failed 1990s peace process, he was criticized by followers of Israel's leading dove, Yossi Beilin, for expressing doubts that the Palestinians would honor their commitments. He was also criticized by some on the pro-Israel right for his view that Israel's Palestinian policy should be decided by its elected government, not by pro- Israel organizations abroad. AIPAC-watchers often describe Rosen as a \\"security hawk\\" on the pro-Israel spectrum, though he did not in principle oppose territorial compromise or a two-state solution if the necessary conditions could be achieved.  Failed espionage prosecution  On August 27, 2004, CBS News reported, \\"A spy is working for Israel at the Pentagon‚Ä¶ The suspected mole supplied Israel with classified materials‚Ä¶passing classified information‚Ä¶to two men at AIPAC, and on to the Israelis...[including] a presidential directive on U.S. policy toward Iran.\\" On screen, CBS showed an image of a document titled \\"Presidential Directive: U.S. Policy Toward Iran,\\" and a file folder marked \\"classified\\" passing from a man labeled \\"suspected spy\\" to a box marked with the AIPAC logo and from there to Israel as symbolized by its flag. The same day, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, accompanied by media camera crews, raided AIPAC offices with a warrant to inspect the paper and electronic files of Steven Rosen. This led to intense worldwide media attention to the allegation that AIPAC was enmeshed in a major espionage program. Critics of AIPAC and Israel saw validation for their thesis that pro-Israel advocacy is inimical to the American national interest. In The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy (2007), for example, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt write that, although countries spying on their allies is common enough to be \\"neither surprising nor particularly reprehensible, ... [n]onetheless, the close relationship between Washington and Jerusalem has made it easier for Israel to steal American secrets, and it has not hesitated to do just that. At the very least, Israel's willingness to spy on its principal patron casts further doubt on its overall strategic value, especially now that the Cold War is over.\\"John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt. The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy (Macmillan, 2007), p. 77. Pentagon official Lawrence Franklin was indicted on May 26, 2005, and Rosen and Weissman were indicted on August 4, 2005. The prosecution was brought under various sections of the Espionage Act, for example . Some of the laws had been in effect since 1917. One provision under which Rosen and Weissman were indicted‚Äîsection 793(e)‚Äîwas added in 1950 under the McCarran Internal Security Act. The case largely hinged on a telephone conversation between the two men and Washington Post reporter Glenn Kessler. = Indictment = The indictment of Rosen and Weissman, filed in Alexandria, Virginia on August 4, 2005, alleges that: \\"Between in or about April 1999 and continuing until on or about August 27, 2004, in the Eastern District of Virginia and elsewhere, defendants Lawrence Anthony Franklin, Steven J. Rosen, and Keith Weissman did unlawfully, knowingly and willfully conspire, confederate and agree together and with others, known and unknown to the Grand Jury, to commit the following offenses against the United States: # \\"having lawful possession of, access to, and control over information relating to the national defense, did willfully communicate, deliver and transmit that information directly and indirectly to a person or persons not entitled to receive it, having reason to believe that said information could be used to the injury of the United States and to the advantage of any foreign nation, a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 793(d); and # \\"having unauthorized possession of, access to, and control over information relating to the national defense, did willfully communicate, deliver and transmit that information directly and indirectly to a person or persons not entitled to receive it, having reason to believe that said information could be used to the injury of the United States and to the advantage of any foreign nation, a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 793(e).\\" = Failed conspiracy allegations = The indictment stated:Indictment text # \\"It was part of the conspiracy that, in an effort to influence persons within and outside the United States government, Rosen and Weissman would cultivate relationships with Franklin and others and would use their contacts within the U.S. government and elsewhere to gather sensitive U.S. government information, including classified information relating to the national defense, for subsequent unlawful communication, delivery and transmission to persons not entitled to receive it. # \\"It was further part of the conspiracy that Franklin would use his position as a desk officer in the Office of the Secretary of Defense to gather information relating to the national defense, for subsequent unlawful communication, delivery and transmission to Rosen and Weissman and others not entitled to receive it. # \\"It was further part of the conspiracy that Franklin, Rosen and Weissman would meet at locations in the Eastern District of Virginia and elsewhere, to exchange information, including classified information relating to the national defense. # \\"It was further part of the conspiracy that Franklin would unlawfully deliver, communicate and transmit classified national defense information in an effort to advance his own personal foreign policy agenda and influence persons within and outside the United States government. # \\"It was further part of the conspiracy that Rosen and Weissman, without lawful authority, would communicate to persons not entitled to receive it, classified information relating to the national defense.\\" = Insufficiency of witnesses = Rosen and Weissman were accused of receiving classified information and disclosing it to others. Their defense claimed that government officials are often authorized to disclose classified information to groups like AIPAC, to advance the national interest. The judge‚Äôs ruling on November 2, 2007, ordered Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and more than 10 other prominent current and former government officials to testify at the trial. The opinion directed that subpoenas be issued to Rice, national security adviser Stephen J. Hadley, former Department of Defense officials Paul D. Wolfowitz and Douglas J. Feith, and former deputy secretary of state Richard L. Armitage. United States District Court Judge T. S. Ellis, III said, \\"Defendants claim that testimony from these current and former officials will tend to show that the [acts cited in the indictment] reflect nothing more than the well-established official Washington practice of engaging in 'back channel' communication with various non governmental entities and persons for the purpose of advancing U.S. foreign policy goals‚Ä¶If true, the U.S. government's use of AIPAC for 'back channel' purposes may serve to exculpate defendants by negating the criminal states of mind the government must prove to convict defendants of the charged offenses. ‚Ä¶ Defendants are entitled to show that‚Ä¶the meetings charged in the Indictment were simply further examples of the government's use of AIPAC as a diplomatic back channel.\\" The ruling said that, if the government refused to produce these witnesses, \\"The government's refusal to comply with a subpoena in these circumstances may result in dismissal\\" of the case \\"or a lesser sanction\\". = Prosecutors drop charges = On May 1, 2009 prosecutors announced they would ask the judge to dismiss the cases against Rosen and Weissman because of \\"the diminished likelihood the government will prevail at trial under the additional intent requirements imposed by the court and the inevitable disclosure of classified information that would occur at any trial.\\" An appeals court had ruled that the defense could use classified information at trial and a lower-court judge had ruled that prosecutors had to show that the two men knew that the information they allegedly disclosed would harm the United States, which the Washington Post described as \\"a high burden for prosecutors\\". Weissman lawyer Baruch Weiss said that defense lawyers \\"were able to put together an array of experts to demonstrate to the government that the information\\" the men were accused of passing along was \\"innocuous.\\"Jerry Markon, Prosecutors to Drop Charges Against Two Former AIPAC Lobbyists, Washington Post, May 1, 2009.

Fort Paskoya or Paskoyac or Pasquia was a French fort and trading post on the lower Saskatchewan River above Cedar Lake. Around 1740 La V√©rendrye built four forts to control the chain of lakes west of Lake Winnipeg. These were Fort Pascoya, Fort Bourbon, Fort Dauphin and Fort La Reine. Their purpose was to trade in furs and to divert to Montreal furs that had previously gone to the English on Hudson Bay. Pascoya had a good location because most of the furs from the west and northwest came down the Saskatchewan. The forts were also part of a quest for a river that led to the western sea, which Verendrye now thought was the Saskatchewan. It was named after a Cree word for narrows, or after the Opaskwayak Cree Nation, whom the explorers encountered. \\"Paskoyac\\" was also an old name for the Saskatchewan River. There is also a Pasquia River at The Pas. First Paskoya: In 1740 Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La V√©rendrye mapped the west side of Cedar Lake. During the winter of 1741-42, the elder La V√©rendrye decided to build a fort on a small island where the river discharges into Cedar Lake. This post soon became a minor outpost of the first Fort Bourbon. The second Fort Bourbon was probably built nearby. Second Paskoya: The second Fort Paskoya was built upstream at what is now The Pas. MortonArthur Morton, \\"A History of the Canadian West\\",page 236 thinks it was built in 1750 and first occupied by Joseph-Claude Boucher, Chevalier de Niverville. In 1753 or 1754 it was strengthened by Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne. In 1754 it was visited by Anthony Henday who described it as a \\"hogstye\\". It was closed in 1759 during the fall of New France. In 1775 Alexander Henry the elder was blocked near here by a chief called The Pelican who demanded tribute to continue up the river. About the same time the Frobishers had a single trader on the site. The North West Company seems to have had a post here which was taken over by the Hudson's Bay Company.

A reflexive relationship is bidirectional with both the cause and the effect affecting one another in a relationship in which neither can be assigned as causes or effects. Within sociology more broadly‚Äîthe field of origin‚Äîreflexivity means an act of self- reference where examination or action \\"bends back on\\", refers to, and affects the entity instigating the action or examination. It commonly refers to the capacity of an agent to recognize forces of socialization and alter their place in the social structure. A low level of reflexivity would result in an individual shaped largely by their environment (or \\"society\\"). A high level of social reflexivity would be defined by an individual shaping their own norms, tastes, politics, desires, and so on. This is similar to the notion of autonomy. (See also structure and agency and social mobility.) Within economics, reflexivity refers to the self-reinforcing effect of market sentiment, whereby rising prices attract buyers whose actions drive prices higher still until the process becomes unsustainable. This is an instance of a positive feedback loop. The same process can operate in reverse leading to a catastrophic collapse in prices. Overview In social theory, reflexivity may occur when theories in a discipline should apply equally to the discipline itself; for example, in the case that the theories of knowledge construction in the field of sociology of scientific knowledge should apply equally to knowledge construction by sociology of scientific knowledge practitioners, or when the subject matter of a discipline should apply equally to the individual practitioners of that discipline (e.g., when psychological theory should explain the psychological processes of psychologists). More broadly, reflexivity is considered to occur when the observations of observers in the social system affect the very situations they are observing, or when theory being formulated is disseminated to and affects the behaviour of the individuals or systems the theory is meant to be objectively modelling. Thus, for example, an anthropologist living in an isolated village may affect the village and the behaviour of its citizens under study. The observations are not independent of the participation of the observer. Reflexivity is, therefore, a methodological issue in the social sciences analogous to the observer effect. Within that part of recent sociology of science that has been called the strong programme, reflexivity is suggested as a methodological norm or principle, meaning that a full theoretical account of the social construction of, say, scientific, religious or ethical knowledge systems, should itself be explainable by the same principles and methods as used for accounting for these other knowledge systems. This points to a general feature of naturalised epistemologies, that such theories of knowledge allow for specific fields of research to elucidate other fields as part of an overall self-reflective process: Any particular field of research occupied with aspects of knowledge processes in general (e.g., history of science, cognitive science, sociology of science, psychology of perception, semiotics, logic, neuroscience) may reflexively study other such fields yielding to an overall improved reflection on the conditions for creating knowledge. Reflexivity includes both a subjective process of self-consciousness inquiry and the study of social behavior with reference to theories about social relationships. History The principle of reflexivity was perhaps first enunciated by the sociologists William I. Thomas and Dorothy Swaine Thomas, in their book The Child in America, 1928 \\"If men deÔ¨Åne situations as real, they are real in their consequences\\" The theory was later termed the \\"Thomas theorem\\". Sociologist Robert K. Merton (1948, 1949) built on the Thomas principle to define the notion of a self-fulfilling prophecy: that once a prediction or prophecy is made, actors may accommodate their behaviours and actions so that a statement that would have been false becomes true or, conversely, a statement that would have been true becomes false - as a consequence of the prediction or prophecy being made. The prophecy has a constitutive impact on the outcome or result, changing the outcome from what would otherwise have happened. Reflexivity was taken up as an issue in science in general by Karl Popper (1957), who in his book in The Poverty of Historicism highlighted the influence of a prediction upon the event predicted, calling this the 'Oedipus effect' in reference to the Greek tale in which the sequence of events fulfilling the Oracle's prophecy is greatly influenced by the prophecy itself. Popper initially considered such self-filling prophecy a distinguishing feature of social science, but later came to see that in the natural sciences, particularly biology and even molecular biology, something equivalent to expectation comes into play and can act to bring about that which has been expected. It was also taken up by Ernest Nagel (1961). Reflexivity presents a problem for science because if a prediction can lead to changes in the system that the prediction is made in relation to, it becomes difficult to assess scientific hypotheses by comparing the predictions they entail with the events that actually occur. The problem is even more difficult in the social sciences. Reflexivity has been taken up as the issue of \\"reflexive prediction\\" in economic science by Grunberg and Modigliani (1954) and Herbert A. Simon (1954), has been debated as a major issue in relation to the Lucas Critique, and has been raised as a methodological issue in economic science arising from the issue of reflexivity in the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) literature. Reflexivity has emerged as both an issue and a solution in modern approaches to the problem of structure and agency, for example in the work of Anthony Giddens in his structuration theory and Pierre Bourdieu in his genetic structuralism. Giddens, for example, noted that constitutive reflexivity is possible in any social system, and that this presents a distinct methodological problem for the social sciences. Giddens accentuated this theme with his notion of \\"reflexive modernity\\" ‚Äì the argument that, over time, society is becoming increasingly more self-aware, reflective, and hence reflexive. Bourdieu argued that the social scientist is inherently laden with biases, and only by becoming reflexively aware of those biases can the social scientists free themselves from them and aspire to the practice of an objective science. For Bourdieu, therefore, reflexivity is part of the solution, not the problem. Michel Foucault's The Order of Things can be said to touch on the issue of Reflexivity. Foucault examines the history of Western thought since the Renaissance and argues that each historical epoch (he identifies 3, while proposing a 4th) has an episteme, or \\"a historical a priori\\", that structures and organizes knowledge. Foucault argues that the concept of man emerged in the early 19th century, what he calls the \\"Age of Man\\", with the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. He finishes the book by posing the problem of the age of man and our pursuit of knowledge- where \\"man is both knowing subject and the object of his own study\\"; thus, Foucault argues that the social sciences, far from being objective, produce truth in their own mutually exclusive discourses. In economics Economic philosopher George Soros, influenced by ideas put forward by his tutor, Karl Popper (1957), has been an active promoter of the relevance of reflexivity to economics, first propounding it publicly in his 1987 book The Alchemy of Finance.The Alchemy of Finance: Reading the mind of the Market (1987) by George Soros, pp 27-45 He regards his insights into market behavior from applying the principle as a major factor in the success of his financial career. Reflexivity is inconsistent with general equilibrium theory, which stipulates that markets move towards equilibrium and that non-equilibrium fluctuations are merely random noise that will soon be corrected. In equilibrium theory, prices in the long run at equilibrium reflect the underlying economic fundamentals, which are unaffected by prices. Reflexivity asserts that prices do in fact influence the fundamentals and that these newly influenced set of fundamentals then proceed to change expectations, thus influencing prices; the process continues in a self-reinforcing pattern. Because the pattern is self-reinforcing, markets tend towards disequilibrium. Sooner or later they reach a point where the sentiment is reversed and negative expectations become self-reinforcing in the downward direction, thereby explaining the familiar pattern of boom and bust cycles An example Soros cites is the procyclical nature of lending, that is, the willingness of banks to ease lending standards for real estate loans when prices are rising, then raising standards when real estate prices are falling, reinforcing the boom and bust cycle. He further suggests that property price inflation is essentially a reflexive phenomenon: house prices are influenced by the sums that banks are prepared to advance for their purchase, and these sums are determined by the banks' estimation of the prices that the property would command. Soros has often claimed that his grasp of the principle of reflexivity is what has given him his \\"edge\\" and that it is the major factor contributing to his successes as a trader. For several decades there was little sign of the principle being accepted in mainstream economic circles, but there has been an increase of interest following the crash of 2008, with academic journals, economists, and investors discussing his theories.Journal of Economic Methodology, Volume 20, Issue 4, 2013: Special Issue: Reflexivity and Economics: George Soros's Theory of Reflexivity and the Methodology of Economic Science http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rjec20/20/4 For example, Larry Summers, Joe Stiglitz, and Paul Volker in: Financial Times, The Credit Crunch According to Soros, January 30, 2009. http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9553cce2-eb65-11dd-8838-0000779fd2ac.html Economist and former columnist of the Financial Times, Anatole Kaletsky, argued that Soros' concept of reflexivity is useful in understanding the way in which Western analysts believe that China's \\"economy is not only slowing, but falling off a cliff.\\" The perception that China is the weakest link in the global economy dominated the International Monetary Fund annual meeting in Peru in October 2015. In reality, China's GDP in 2005 was $2.3 trillion and in 2015 is $10.3 trillion, the renminbi stabilized in October, capital flight dwindled, and according to Kaletsky, there are \\"better-than-expected reserve figures released by the People‚Äôs Bank of China on October 7.\\" Kaletsky claims that suspect but powerful financial feedback perceptions are constantly \\"self- reinforced\\" but that they do not reflect economic reality. According to Soros' concept of reflexivity, \\"financial markets can create inaccurate expectations and then change reality to accord with them. This is the opposite of the process described in textbooks and built into economic models, which always assume that financial expectations adapt to reality, not the other way round.\\" The Chinese government‚Äôs \\"policy of shifting gradually to a market-based exchange rate\\" reveals that China may better understand \\"reflexive interactions among finance, the real economy, and government than \\"Western devotees of free markets capitalism.\\" Kaletsky warned against making the same mistakes as those made in 2008 when \\"financial expectations\\" based on reflexivity, interacted with \\"policy blunders, turning modest economic problems into major catastrophes, first in the US and then in the eurozone.\\" In 2009, Soros funded the launch of the Institute for New Economic Thinking with the hope that it would develop reflexivity further.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHSEEJDKJho&t;=41m30s The Institute works with several types of Heterodox economics, particularly the Post- Keynesian branch.https://www.ineteconomics.org/community/young- scholars/working-groups/post-keynesian-working-group  In sociology  Margaret Archer has written extensively on laypeople's reflexivity. For her, human reflexivity is a mediating mechanism between structural properties, or the individual's social context, and action, or the individual's ultimate concerns. Reflexive activity, according to Archer, increasingly takes the place of habitual action in late modernity since routine forms prove ineffective in dealing with the complexity of modern life trajectories. While Archer emphasizes the agentic aspect of reflexivity, reflexive orientations can themselves be seen as being socially and temporally embedded. For example, Elster points out that reflexivity cannot be understood without taking into account the fact that it draws on background configurations (e.g., shared meanings, as well as past social engagement and lived experiences of the social world) to be operative. In anthropology In anthropology, reflexivity has come to have two distinct meanings, one that refers to the researcher's awareness of an analytic focus on his or her relationship to the field of study, and the other that attends to the ways that cultural practices involve consciousness and commentary on themselves. The first sense of reflexivity in anthropology is part of social science's more general self- critique in the wake of theories by Michel Foucault and others about the relationship of power and knowledge production. Reflexivity about the research process became an important part of the critique of the colonial roots and scientistic methods of anthropology in the \\"writing cultures\\" movement associated with James Clifford and George Marcus, as well as many other anthropologists. Rooted in literary criticism and philosophical analysis of the relationship of anthropologist, representations of people in texts, and the people represented, this approach has fundamentally changed ethical and methodological approaches in anthropology. As with the feminist and anti- colonial critiques that provide some of reflexive anthropology's inspiration, the reflexive understanding of the academic and political power of representations, analysis of the process of \\"writing culture\\" has become a necessary part of understanding the situation of the ethnographer in the fieldwork situation. Objectification of people and cultures and analysis of them only as objects of study has been largely rejected in favor of developing more collaborative approaches that respect local people's values and goals. Nonetheless, many anthropologists have accused the \\"writing cultures\\" approach of muddying the scientific aspects of anthropology with too much introspection about fieldwork relationships, and reflexive anthropology have been heavily attacked by more positivist anthropologists.Roy D'Andrade. Moral Models in Anthropology. Current Anthropology Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jun., 1995), 399-408. Herbert S. Lewis. The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and Its Consequences. American Anthropologist. Vol. 100, No. 3 (Sep., 1998), pp. 716-731 Considerable debate continues in anthropology over the role of postmodernism and reflexivity, but most anthropologists accept the value of the critical perspective, and generally only argue about the relevance of critical models that seem to lead anthropology away from its earlier core foci. The second kind of reflexivity studied by anthropologists involves varieties of self- reference in which people and cultural practices call attention to themselves.BARBARA A. BABCOCK. Reflexivity: Definitions and discriminations. Semiotica. 1980 30:1-2, 1-14 One important origin for this approach is Roman Jakobson in his studies of deixis and the poetic function in language, but the work of Mikhail Bakhtin on carnival has also been important. Within anthropology, Gregory Bateson developed ideas about meta-messages (subtext) as part of communication, while Clifford Geertz's studies of ritual events such as the Balinese cock-fight point to their role as foci for public reflection on the social order. Studies of play and tricksters further expanded ideas about reflexive cultural practices. Reflexivity has been most intensively explored in studies of performance,Turner, Victor.

In researching cultural practices reflexivity plays important role but because of its complexity and subtlety it often goes under- investigated or involves highly specialized analyses.Lucy, John A.

Malden: Blackwell, 2001 One use of studying reflexivity is in connection to authenticity. Cultural traditions are often imagined as perpetuated as stable ideals by uncreative actors. Innovation may or may not change tradition, but since reflexivity is intrinsic to many cultural activities, reflexivity is part of tradition and not inauthentic. The study of reflexivity shows that people have both self-awareness and creativity in culture. They can play with, comment upon, debate, modify, and objectify culture through manipulating many different features in recognized ways. This leads to the metaculture of conventions about managing and reflecting upon culture.Urban, Greg. (2001). Metaculture: how culture moves through the world. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press Reflexivity and the status of the social sciences Flanagan has argued that reflexivity complicates all three of the traditional roles that are typically played by a classical science: explanation, prediction and control. The fact that individuals and social collectivities are capable of self-inquiry and adaptation is a key characteristic of real- world social systems, differentiating the social sciences from the physical sciences. Reflexivity, therefore, raises real issues regarding the extent to which the social sciences may ever be viewed as \\"hard\\" sciences analogous to classical physics, and raises questions about the nature of the social sciences.Flanagan, O.

Ontario and British Columbia are the two largest wine-producing provinces in Canada, with two-thirds of the Canada's vineyard acreage situated in Ontario. However, wine producing regions are also present in other provinces, including Alberta, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In 2015, Canada produced 56.2 million litres of wine, with 62 per cent of that total originating from Ontario. The second largest wine- producing province, British Columbia, constitutes 33 per cent of Canada's wine production. Between 2006 and 2011, 68 per cent of Canadian wine exports came from Ontario-based wineries; with 14 per cent of exports originating from British Columbia, 12 per cent from Quebec, and six per cent from Alberta. Icewine can be produced reliably in most Canadian wine-producing regions. As a result, Canada is the world's leading icewine producer, with more icewine produced in Canada than all other countries combined. More than 90 per cent of Canadian icewines originates from Ontario, although the product is also produced in British Columbia, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. In addition to standard grape wines, and icewines, the country is also home to several fruit wineries and meaderies, found in provinces such as in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, provinces whose local climate is not favourable for grape production. History A vineyard in Canada, 1905. The first commercial winery was opened in Canada in the mid-19th century. Canadian wine has been produced for over 200 years. Early settlers tried to cultivate Vitis vinifera grapes from Europe with limited success. They found it necessary to focus on the native species of Vitis labrusca and Vitis riparia along with various hybrids. However, the market was limited for such wines because of their peculiar taste which was often called \\"foxy\\". However, this became less apparent when the juice was made into Port- and Sherry-styled wines. In 1866, the first commercial winery opened in Canada, situated on Pelee Island in Ontario. During the first half of the twentieth century, the temperance movement and later consumer demand for fortified and sweet wines hampered the development of a quality table wine industry. Consumer demand did not shift from sweet and fortified wines to drier and lower alcohol table wines until the 1960s. At the same time, there were significant improvements in wine- making technology, access to better grape varieties and disease-resistant clones, and systematic research into viticulture. After the repeal of alcohol prohibition in Canada in 1927, provinces strictly limited the number of licences to produce wine. A nearly 50-year moratorium on issuing new winery licences was finally dropped in 1974. During the same decade, demonstration planting began to show that Vitis vinifera could be successfully grown in Canada. Other growers found that high quality wines could be produced if Vitis vinifera vines were grown with reduced yields, new trellising techniques, and appropriate canopy management. A Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) label on a Canadian bottle of wine. The VQA was established in 1988 as a regulatory and appellation system for British Columbia and Ontario wines. In 1988, three important events occurred: free trade with the United States, the establishment of the Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) standard, and a major grape vine replacement/upgrading program. The VQA acts as the regulatory and appellation system that intends to ensure \\"high quality\\" and \\"authenticity of origin\\" for Canadian wines from the provinces of British Columbia, and Ontario. Each of these events served in one way or another to improve the viability of the wine industry in Canada. During the 1990s, Canadian vintners continued to demonstrate that fine grape varieties in cooler growing conditions could potentially possess complex flavours, delicate yet persistent aromas, tightly focused structure and longer ageing potential than their counterparts in warmer growing regions of the world. =Cellared in Canada= Cellared in Canada was a former indicator from 1994 to 2018 for wine products from Canadian wineries, whose grape must originated from outside of Canada. Canadian wineries are able to import pre-fermented grape must from other countries, and use it to produce wine under their own products. The maximum quantity of foreign wine used in Cellared in Canada wine products depended on the province the wine originated from; with certain provinces requiring a minimum amount of local grapes be used in order for it to qualify as Cellared in Canada wine. In Ontario, 30 per cent of the grapes in Cellared in Canada wine had to originate from local wineries. Conversely British Columbia did not stipulate the use of local grapes in the production of its Cellared in Canada wine products. In late 2009, local and international criticism of the Cellared in Canada practice and the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) emerged. Grape growers in Ontario began protesting the practice as a threat to their livelihood claiming that thousands of tons of Canadian grapes are left rotting on the vine because producers are using imported grapes to make wine labelled as \\"Canadian\\". Wine producers who do not use the \\"Cellared in Canada\\" designation criticized the practice as tarnishing the reputation of Canadian wines and misleading consumers. Producers and growers in Canada have petitioned the government for several changes in the practices such as making the origin of grapes more clear on the wine label and increasing the visibility of 100 per cent Canadian wines produced by members of the Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) in province run liquor stores. As of August 2009, the province stores of the LCBO featured less than 2.5 per cent Canadian wine produced by VQA members with the vast majority of its wines produced under the \\"Cellared in Canada\\" designation with up to 70 per cent foreign grapes.K. Ejbich \\"Protest Mounts Over \\"Cellared in Canada\\" Wines\\" Wine Spectator, August 28, 2009 In March 2018, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced the Cellared in Canada designation replaced by two new designations, dependent on the quantity of foreign wine mixed into the product. Products that are primarily made of foreign grapes are designated \\"International blend from imported and domestic wines\\"; whereas primarily domestic wines that contain foreign grapes are designated \\"International blend from domestic and imported wines\\". Market share Niagara-based winery's grapes freezing over, a process that allows for the creation of icewine. Wineries in Ontario constitute the majority of Canada's icewine exports. In 2015, the province of Quebec is the largest consumers of wine, with each resident consuming an average of 23 litres a year. However, Canadian wines make up less than 50 per cent share of the Canadian wine market, making Canada one of the few wine- producing countries where domestically produced wines do not hold a dominant share. Wine in general has been increasing its market share against other alcoholic beverages (beer and spirits). Since the late 1990s wine has increased its market share from 21 per cent to 28 per cent and since 2007 wine sales have increased by 9.5 per cent to C$5 billion. While there are many small Canadian wineries, the domestic wine market has long been dominated by two companies, Vincor International and Andres Wines. In 2006, Vincor International, which had grown aggressively in previous years by acquiring wineries in California, Australia and New Zealand, was itself acquired by Constellation Brands, a U.S.-based company and one of the primary consolidators of the global wine business. =Global market= In 2017, Canadian wineries exported 2.1 million litres of wine (valued at C$39.6 million), and constitutes 0.1 per cent of global exports. The largest export markets for Canadian wine is China, the United States, South Korea, the Netherlands, and Japan. Between 2006 and 2011, 68 per cent of Canadian wine exports came from Ontario-based wineries; with 14 per cent of exports originating from British Columbia, 12 per cent from Quebec, and six per cent from Alberta. Icewine is a major export product for Canadian wineries. Ontario is the largest exporter of icewine, exporting a value of C$21.3 million, followed by British Columbia, which exported a value of C$3.2 million. However, the majority of icewines exported to France and Switzerland originate from Ontario and Quebec. Conversely, majority of Canadian sparkling wine imported in Switzerland originates from British Columbia. Production Wine regions of Canada, 2006. In 2015, Canada produced 56.2 million litres of wine; 62 per cent of which originated from Ontario. The second largest wine- producing province, British Columbia, constitutes 33 per cent of Canada's wine production. In particular, Canada is the largest producer of icewine, with Canada producing a greater volume of icewine than all other countries combined. Icewine is made in every wine-producing region of Canada, although the majority of Canadian icewine is produced in Ontario, whose wineries constitute over 90 per cent of Canadian icewine production. In 2015, there are 548 wineries in Canada, spread over . Ontario holds the largest acreage of vineyards in Canada, with 150 vineyards spread across . There are three VQA designated viticultural areas in Ontario, the Niagara Peninsula (which includes ten different sub-appellations), Prince Edward County, and the north shore of Lake Erie. Small but fast-growing wine industries can also be found in the Lambton and Huron County regions of Southwestern Ontario. Vitis vinifera is the most common grapevine grown in Ontario-based vineyards, with a focus on cultivating Chardonnay, Riesling, pinot noir, and Cabernet Franc. British Columbia holds 240 wineries, spread throughout . Wineries in British Columbia primarily grow vitis vinifera, with the top planted grapes being Chardonnay, Merlot, pinot gris, and pinot noir. There are five VQA designated viticultural regions in British Columbia, Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, the Fraser Valley, Similkameen Valley, and the Okanagan Valley. Gaspereau, Nova Scotia.

Originally intended as a meeting hall for the Freemasons, construction work began in 1927, but was halted in 1929 as a result of the financial crisis of that year. With the outbreak of World War II, construction was halted permanently.

In 2004, the building was purchased by Sage Hospitality Resources, which converted it into a luxury hotel, which opened in June 2007. The adjoining building known as the Veterans Memorial Auditorium (VMA), located between the hotel and Interstate 95, was originally part of the same complex, and was connected to the unfinished Masonic Temple by a small structure at ground level. While construction halted at the same time as that at the Temple building, the auditorium was completed in the 1950s.

The island is in area and has about of shoreline. It is part of Whitney Township, in Arenac County. The island also contains an 11-acre (0.04 km¬≤) pond, literally a 'lake within a lake', fed by springs. The island was named by lake mariners for its location, placed 'through the charity of God' at the entrance to Saginaw Bay midway between the city of Au Gres, Michigan and \\"The Thumb\\". The islands were not known as the Charity Islands until after 1845. Maps before 1800 show the islands unnamed. According to an 1839 map, Big Charity Island was referred to as Shawangunk, while Little Charity Island was known as Ile de Traverse.Michigan State University Map Archive (Michigan, 1839) The island is largely forested, mainly with mixed hardwoods. The humid ecoclimate is friendly to a diverse herbarium, including some rare plant species. Its isolated beaches and unique hardwood forest provides excellent habitat for a variety of plants and animals. Many rare and protected species of plants grow on the Island including Pitcher's thistle, acres of Trillium, Jack in the Pulpit, and Pink Lady Slippers. The island is best known among mariners for its former lighthouse. Charity Island Light was constructed in 1857. It operated in 1857-1930 and was then replaced by the Gravelly Shoal Light.A.W. Sweigert, \\"Calendar\\", Inland Seas 43:2 (Summer 1987), page 133. The island was offered for sale in 1987 for $750,000. In 1993 it was purchased by Standish real estate broker Robert Wiltse and other investors with plans consisting of 24 large houses. After accepting 15 deposits and constructing a harbor, Wiltse changed his mind about the development. In 1997, he sold more than 80% of the island to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an addition to the Michigan Islands National Wildlife Refuge (MINWR) system, and a few acres to The Nature Conservancy (which also bought the lighthouse from the government). Geologically, the island contains pockets of chert that are believed to have been quarried by Native Americans. Offshore, the gravel reefs to the south creates a shallow-water channel separating Charity Island from its smaller neighbor, Little Charity Island. The area between the two islands is a favorite spot for fishing. On the northeast end of the island, a small bay is lined with limestone bedrock, offering good holding ground as a place to anchor during storms. The harbor of refuge is accessible by small boat, though access is controlled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Tours of the island (and even dinner cruises) are available. They include the privately owned, rebuilt Charity Island Lightlightkeeper's house and a passing view of Gravelly Shoal Light. They are available from a ferry company in Au Gres, Michigan on the mainland, south of Tawas.Charity Island ferry service.

Early work  Billy TK on stage at Nambassa in 1981. As a child, Billy TK lived in Bunnythorpe, a small town outside of Palmerston North, New Zealand. His surname of Te Kahika was abbreviated to 'TK' by Pakeha teachers. He was inspired to learn guitar by listening to construction workers working on nearby hydroelectric dams. He began playing guitar at an early age, and was surrounded by talented young musicians during his family's frequent visits to Ratana PƒÅ, who helped fulfill his lust for improving his skills on his instrument. He played gigs for friends and family during his high school years, and once he had finished school, he set to build his own band. The result of this was The Sinners with Ted Cash on drums, Sonny Ratana on bass, Harold Hine on rhythm guitar and lead vocalist Theo Swanson. The band played at 21st birthday parties and the like until being invited to play at Rickies nightclub in Palmerston North and other venues around the Manawatu. The Sinners were one of the first New Zealand bands to utilise distortion and similar guitar effects, and these effects would become a staple of Billy's guitar sound. It was around this time, in the mid-1960s, that Billy TK's friend, Ara Mete, gave Billy a gift ‚Äî his first fuzz box and treble booster. Billy quickly took it to an electrical shop in Palmerston North, where he had copies of both made. Billy was hooked on the sound, and his obsession for guitar effects only received more grounding once the Jimi Hendrix album Are You Experienced? hit the airwaves in New Zealand, and Billy quickly made The Sinners learn all the tracks on the album.  Human Instinct  After four years of playing together, The Sinners were reduced to a three piece band when Theo Swanson and Harold Hine both left, after which Billy TK also parted ways with the band to travel to Melbourne to set up a unit there called Compulsion with Paddy Beach and Reno Tehei. On Billy's return to New Zealand in May 1968, Billy TK auditioned for The Human Instinct, with Maurice Greer on vocals and bass player Frank Hay, and after playing for them once, he was allowed into the band. After a tour of the South Island and two changes of bass players, the band was ready to play the Auckland circuit, where they mesmerised their audiences with their edgy, heavily Hendrix influenced hard rock sound. The trio recorded three albums with Billy TK on guitar; Burning Up Years, Stoned Guitar and Pins In It, which made the band legendary in New Zealand. In 1970, Human Instinct played a three nights a week residency at the Bo Peep club, (Durham Lane) on one occasion with guest band The Game (1970 Battle of the Bands Auckland Winners). Human Instinct also played two nights at Hatchets,(24 Cook St) also supported on one night by The Game. In 1972 during a short tour of Australia, Billy TK left Human Instinct after a series of disagreements on musical direction. He was replaced by Graeme Collins (Dedikation/Dragon) and the group recorded three more albums before going into hiatus.  Billy TK's Powerhouse  In 1972 he formed a new band, Billy TK's Powerhouse, playing in Wellington with former Blackfeather drummer Steve Webb from Australia, guitarist John Bilderbeck from Wanganui and Gav Collinge on bass. When Webb and Bilderbeck left, Powerhouse shifted base to Palmerston North, recruiting Ara Mete on rhythm guitar, Jamie Tait-Jamieson on keyboards, Bud Hooper on drums, Arnold Tihema on congas and lead vocals and Mahia Blackmore on vocals and percussion. The band later also featured Neal Storey (ex-Dragon) and Peter Kellington. Powerhouse also supported Black Sabbath, Split Enz, John Mayall, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, UB40, Joe Satriani and the Neville Brothers in concert, although keyboardist Jamie Tait-Jamieson (founder of Biofarm Products Ltd.) left the group during this period, having given up full-time musicianship to run his family farm and marry his fianc√©e Catherine Rowland.Biofarm Products Home Page Powerhouse disbanded in 1977. They released no records during their career, although an album's worth of unreleased 1972 studio recordings (all cover versions) were belatedly issued in 2009 as Move On Up. A live concert recorded in 1975 also received a very limited vinyl release in 1990 as Life Beyond The Material Sky.  Later work  In April 1996, TK performed a song with Carlos Santana at an Auckland concert. He has worked with several bands including Dunedin Flying Nun Records band King Loser, with whom he recorded an album. He also recorded with hip hop artist DLT. He continues to perform and has played at several Human Instinct reunion gigs. In November 2008 TK unexpectedly joined former Powerhouse keyboardist Jamie Tait-Jamieson (now part of the 4-piece Manawatu family group The T-Bar Jays) onstage at the inaugural Mai Farm Festival in the Pohangina Valley. January 2008 saw Billy play with the Emma Paki Band opening the Parihaka International Peace Festival with Emma Paki, Mara TK, Jonathan Crayford, James Davenport, and others. In January 2009, Billy played again at the Parihaka International Peace Festival, this time as part of a reunited Powerhouse. In June 2010 came the release of Gordonia, a feature film with a soundtrack by Billy. The film featured two tracks with the Human Instinct and a new recording, Gordonia Electric Suite.

Nicknamed the \\"Man of Bronze\\", he was Canada's most-decorated Olympian for many years. He was the first-ever winner of the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada's top athlete. He went on to serve as a captain in the Canadian army and as a highly regarded physician and expert of tropical diseases. __TOC__ Early years Edwards was born in Georgetown, British Guiana (now Guyana), to a family of thirteen children. His father was a magistrate, and the family was part of the Black elite in the colony. Edwards' father was one of eighteen children and was originally from Barbados. Less is known of his mother, but it is thought that she may originally have been from Trinidad. In a 1928 New York Daily News article, it was stated that Edwards' paternal grandmother was East Indian and his maternal grandfather was Scottish and that fellow Olympian Jack London was a classmate of his at Queen's College in Georgetown. Growing up in what Edwards called 'a country district', he practiced sprinting by racing an angry cow, according to the article.\\"Angry Cow Instilled Speed In Phil Edwards of N.Y.U.\\", New York Daily News, 20 May 1928 p.30 Athletics Career=New York University= By the age of 16, Edwards dominated track events at his school. After graduating, he left British Guiana and moved to the United States, enrolling at New York University (NYU) in 1925, where his elder brother ‚ÄúKing‚Äù Edward was already a student athlete. Edwards‚Äô parents and several of his siblings also emigrated to New York, where they founded a law and real estate firm in Harlem. Under the guidance of NYU coach Emil Von Elling, Edwards steadily improved as a runner, particularly in 880-yard races. In 1927 he narrowly missed winning the US national title in the 880 yards event, a race he later won in 1929. =Olympics and British Empire Games= While Edwards' performances at New York University clearly established him as an Olympic-calibre athlete, he was not eligible to compete for the United States as he was not an American citizen. However, as a British subject, Edwards was eligible to compete for another country within the empire. In 1927 he was invited by Melville Marks (Bobby) Robinson, manager of the Canadian Olympic track and field team, to compete for Canada in the 1928 Summer Olympics, where Edwards won a bronze medal as part of Canada's 4 √ó 400 metre relay team.Phil Edwards. Sports Reference.com Following Amsterdam, Edwards left New York University to attend Montreal's McGill University as a medical student, where he also competed with the university's track team. Edwards also continued his association with Bobby Robinson there, competing for British Guiana in the first-ever British Empire Games which were created largely due to Robinson's efforts, held in Hamilton, Ontario in 1930. He finished fifth in the 880 yards event as well as in the 1 mile competition. In the 440 yards contest he was eliminated in the heats. He would go on to compete once more for British Guiana in the 1934 British Empire Games in London where he became the first black man to be awarded a gold medal in what are now the Commonwealth Games by winning the 880 yards race. At McGill, Edwards captained the university track team from 1931 to 1936, leading the team to six consecutive championships. At the international level, Edwards went on to compete in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and in the infamous 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, where he was one of a number of black athletes, including American runner Jesse Owens, to compete before the Hitler regime. Edwards earned bronze medals in 1932 in the 800 metres, 1500 metres, and 4 √ó 400 metre relay event, and in 1936 in the 800 metres event. On the way back from the 1936 games, Edwards was refused lodgings in the London hotel at which the team was booked on account of his race; the full team cancelled their stay at the hotel as a result, preferring to accompany him elsewhere. =Post- Olympics= While serving as resident house surgeon at the General Hospital in Barbados, Edwards was approached by British Guiana officials with a proposal to run for the colony at the 1938 British Empire Games. Edwards was either not interested or could not take the necessary time off. However, in 1939 an untrained and semi-injured Edwards was persuaded to compete in a British Guiana ‚ÄúOlympiad‚Äù, ending up fifth in the 880 yards. Edwards' appearance at the event in British Guiana may have given rise to a report in the Indianapolis Recorder, a Black American newspaper, that the runner (\\"prominent in medical circles now\\"), is \\"training in British Guiana with an eye towards the 1940 Finland games in Helsinki\\".\\"Beatin' the Gun\\", Indianapolis Recorder, 2 September 1939 p.16 The 1940 Olympics were soon cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II. In 1957, Edwards and James Worrall were involved in developing Canada's first international sport effort, which assisted young athletes in the Eastern Caribbean. =Recognition= 1928 Olympics. The five bronze medals gave Edwards the nickname 'Man of Bronze', and made him Canada's most prolific Olympic medal-winner; he would be joined in 2002 by Marc Gagnon and later Fran√ßois-Louis Tremblay and eventually surpassed by Cindy Klassen and Clara Hughes, though he retains with Lesley Thompson the distinction of having won the most medals solely at the Summer Olympics. Edwards was among the first black athletes to earn an Olympic medal and, along with Hamilton runner Ray Lewis, Toronto's Sam Richardson and Vancouver's Barbara Howard, one of only a handful of black athletes to represent Canada in the 1920s and 1930s. Edwards was named the inaugural Lou Marsh Trophy winner in 1936 as Canada's top athlete.

He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity at New York University. Medical career Edwards became the first black person to graduate from McGill University's medical school in 1936, immediately before competing in the 1936 Olympic Games and being named Canada's top athlete. He then accepted a three-year position at the General Hospital in Barbados as resident house surgeon. Interrupting his medical career to serve with the Canadian army, Edwards rose to the rank of captain during World War II before returning to Montreal. He earned a graduate medical diploma in 1945 and became a specialist in tropical diseases, joining the staff of Montreal's Royal Victoria Hospital and participating in a number of international medical missions. In 1960, Dr. Edwards was a member of a Canadian Red Cross team of four doctors and six nurses working in Coquilhatville in Congo.\\"Dr. Phil Edwards Dies at 66; Ran for Canada in 3 Olympics\\", New York Times, 8 September 1971 p.49 Edwards' tenure at the Royal Victoria coincided with that of infamous psychiatrist Ewen Cameron; outside his tropical medicine work, Edwards was instrumental in rescuing at least one patient whose physical illness had been misdiagnosed and mistreated by Cameron as a psychiatric matter. Personal life and family At the Amsterdam Olympics, Edwards met his first wife, Edith Margaret Oedelschoff, a native of the former German territory of Alsace-Lorraine and a resident of Weehawken, New Jersey. The couple was married in October 1929 at the Episcopal Church of the Crucifixion on 140th Street in New York City.\\"Athlete To Wed French Girl; New York\\", Indianapolis Recorder, 12 October 1929 p.16 The marriage appears to have broken up some time in the late 1930s or early 1940s. Dr. Edwards was just a few days shy of his 64th birthday when he died of heart problems in 1971. He was survived by his widow Mrs. Diane Edwards and three daughters, Pamela, Dale and Gwendolyn. He is interred in the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal.

Foundations and other sources of grants and other types of funds are interested in organizational effectiveness of those people who seek funds from the foundations. Foundations always have more requests for funds or funding proposals and treat funding as an investment using the same care as a venture capitalist would in picking a company in which to invest. According to Richard et al. (2009) organizational effectiveness captures organizational performance plus the myriad internal performance outcomes normally associated with more efficient or effective operations and other external measures that relate to considerations that are broader than those simply associated with economic valuation (either by shareholders, managers, or customers), such as corporate social responsibility.Richard et al. (2009): Measuring Organizational Performance: Towards Methodological Best Practice. Journal of Management. However, scholars of nonprofit organizational effectiveness acknowledge that the concept has multiple dimensions Herman, Robert D., & Renz, David O. (2008).

Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly. http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/02/01/0899764011434589.abstract For example, while most nonprofit leaders define organizational effectiveness as 'outcome accountability,' or the extent to which an organization achieves specified levels of progress toward its own goals, a minority of nonprofit leaders define effectiveness as 'overhead minimization,' or the minimization of fundraising and administrative costs. Hence, Organizational effectiveness is typically evaluated within nonprofit organizations using logic models. Logic models are a management tool widely used in the nonprofit sector in program evaluation. Logic models are created for specific programs to link specific, measurable inputs to specific, measurable impacts.McLaughlin, John A., & Jordan, Gretchen B. (2010). Using Logic Models. In Joseph S. Wholey, Harry P. Hatry & Kathryn E. Newcomer (Eds.), Handbook of Practical Program Evaluation (3rd ed.). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. Typically, logic models specify how program inputs, such as money and staff time, produce activities and outputs, such as services delivered, which in turn lead to impacts, such as improved beneficiary health.

The band was founded by Jason Sebastian Russo, of Hopewell Junction, New York. At 19, Russo joined Mercury Rev, and then struck out on his own with a band named after his hometown. Career=History= In 1995, seminal Detroit-based space rock label Burnt Hair Records released the band's first single, a split with Michigan-based drone- ambient group Windy & Carl. Hopewell's first full-length, Contact, came out on Burnt Hair in 1997. Their second release, 2001's The Curved Glass, led to European distribution, festival appearances and a John Peel session. What followed was a transition period of line-up and stylistic changes. Most notable was the loss of Dalia Garih as drummer. After regrouping, the band signed to Tee Pee Records and released Hopewell & The Birds Of Appetite, produced by Dave Fridmann of Flaming Lips fame at Tarbox Road Studios. Its follow-up, Beautiful Targets, produced by Fridmann prot√©g√© Bill Racine, was released in 2007 and its symphonic rock leanings were often compared to Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips. The band's 2009 release, Good Good Desperation, took them in a heavier direction, aligned by critics with Pink Floyd's Meddle and Can's Tago Mago. A selective list of bands Hopewell has performed or toured with: My Bloody Valentine, Sonic Youth, Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Dandy Warhols, Nicole Atkins, The Sleepy Jackson, British Sea Power, The Comas, The Black Angels, Goldrush, Mark Gardener, Mike Watt, The Posies, The Lovetones, Garth Hudson, Adam Franklin, The Joy Formidable, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and others. In 2009, Hopewell was tapped to perform at All Tomorrow's Parties, curated by psych-rock superstars, The Flaming Lips. Performers on the bill included The Flaming Lips, Sufjan Stevens, The Jesus Lizard, No Age with Bob Mould performing H√ºsker D√º, Super Furry Animals, Animal Collective, Iron & Wine, Panda Bear, Dirty Three with Nick Cave, Suicide, The Feelies, The Drones, David Cross, Deerhunter, Melvins, Boss Hog, El-P, Dead Meadow, Akron/Family, Sleepy Sun, Black Dice, Antipop Consortium, Autolux, Atlas Sound, Bridezilla, Shellac, Grouper and Circulatory System, Boredoms, Caribou Vibration Ensemble, Deerhoof with Martha Colburn, Crystal Castles, Boris, The Low Lows, Oneida, Black Moth Super Rainbow, Menomena and Birds of Avalon. =Film and TV= Hopewell's music has appeared on the soundtracks for films including Tarnation and PsychoGuru (Tribeca Film Festival selection 2011), and television shows including One Tree Hill and Greek. Other notable appearances include skate videos by Viceland, Thrasher magazine and Converse, as well as the seminal Birdhouse Skateboards film The Beginning. =Recent work= On November 2, 2010, Hopewell released the first volume of a two-part live album, Hopewell Live, recorded between Truck Festival America (2010) and All Tomorrow's Parties, New York in 2009. The first of the two volumes features several songs from Hopewell's fifth full- length, Good Good Desperation (2009, Tee Pee Records) and was released to correspond with the band's US tour supporting The Dandy Warhols. In 2012 Hopewell released the Another Music EP, the lead single of which is a cover of Brian Eno's Needle In The Camel's Eye featuring Mark Gardener of the band Ride on lead vocals.

Made entirely of bronze and measuring 78.5 cm high with a length of 129 cm,https://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/chimaera/chimaera_checklist.pdf it was found alongside a small collection of other bronze statues in Arezzo, an ancient Etruscan and Roman city in Tuscany. The statue was originally part of a larger sculptural group representing a fight between a Chimera and the Greek hero Bellerophon. This sculpture was likely created as a votive offering to the Etruscan god Tinia.  History of the Chimera  According to Greek mythology the Chimera or \\"she-goat\\" was a monstrous, fire-breathing hybrid creature of Lycia in Asia Minor, created by the binding of multiple animal parts to create a singular unnatural creature. As the offspring of Typhon and Echidna, the Chimera ravaged the lands of Lycia at a disastrous pace.Hesiod, Theogony 319-25 Distressed by the destruction of his lands, the king of Lycia, Iobates, ordered a young warrior named Bellerophon to slay the dreaded Chimera, also as a favor to a neighboring king, Proetus. Proetus wanted Bellerophon dead because his wife accused him of ravishing her, and he assumed that the warrior would perish in the attempt to kill the beast. Bellerophon set out on his winged horse, Pegasus, and emerged victorious from his battle, eventually winning not only the hand of Iobates' daughter but also his kingdom. It is this story that led art historians to believe that the Chimera of Arezzo was originally part of a group sculpture that included Bellerophon and Pegasus. Votive offerings for the Gods often depicted mythological stories. A round hole on the left rump of the Chimera might suggest a spot where Bellerophon may have struck the beast with a now-missing spear. The first known literary reference was in Homer's Iliad, and the epic poetry of Hesiod in the 8th century BCE also mentions the Chimera.\\"The Chimaera of Arezzo: July 16, 2009‚ÄìFebruary 8, 2010\\". J. Paul Getty Museum. Retrieved 21 November 2017 In response to questions of the statue's true meaning, Vasari wrote in his Reasonings Over the Inventions He Painted in Florence in the Palace of Their Serene Highnesses: > \\"Yes, sir, because there are the medals of the Duke my lord who came from > Rome with a goat's head stuck in the neck of this lion, who as he sees VE, > also has the serpent's belly, and we found the queue that was broken between > those bronze fragments with many metal figurines that you've seen all, and > the wounds that she has touched on show it, and yet the pain that is known > in the readiness of the head of this animal ...\\"Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli > and Mario Torelli, The Art of Classical Antiquity, Etruria-Rome , Turin, > Utet, 1976 The tail was not restored until 1785 when the Pistoiese sculptor Francesco Carradori (or his teacher, Innocenzo Spinazzi) fashioned a replacement, incorrectly positioning the serpent to bite the goat's horn. It is much more likely that the snake had to strike out against Bellerophon instead, since biting the head of the goat meant it was biting itself. Inscribed on its right foreleg is an inscription in the ancient Etruscan language. It has been variously deciphered, but most recently it is thought to read TINSCVIL, meaning: \\"Offering belonging to Tinia\\",TLE 663; Bonfante and Bonfante 2002, no. 26 p. 147 indicating that the bronze was a votive object dedicated to the supreme Etruscan god of day, Tin or Tinia. The original statue is estimated to have been created around 400 BCE.Chimera, Nordisk familjebok In 1718, the sculpture was transported to the Uffizi Gallery and later, along with the remaining collection Cosimo I had originally seized, taken to the Palazzo della Crocetta. Court intellectuals of the time considered the Chimera of Arezzo to be a symbol of the Medici domination of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Its permanent residence is in the National Archaeological Museum in Florence where it was placed on brief loan to the Getty Villa for an exhibition in 2010. The sculpture was probably commissioned by an aristocratic clan or a prosperous community and erected in a religious sanctuary near the ancient Etruscan town of Arezzo, about 50 miles southeast of Florence. The Chimera was one of a hoard of bronzes that had been carefully buried for safety sometime in classical antiquity. A bronze replica now stands near the spot of its original discovery. = The Etruscans = The Etruscan civilization was a wealthy civilization in ancient Italy with roots in the ancient region of Etruria, which existed during the early 8th-6th century BCE and extended over what is now a part of modern Tuscany, western Umbria, and northern Lazio.\\"The Etruscans, an introduction\\", Laurel Taylor, Khan Academy The region became a part of the Roman Republic after the Roman-Etruscan Wars. Heavily influenced by Ancient Greek culture, Etruscan art is characterized by the use of terracotta, metalworking‚Äîespecially in bronze‚Äîas well as jewelry and engraved gems.Macanamara, Ellen. The Etrustcans, British Museum 1991. Print Metal and bronze trinkets from the Mediterranean rapidly began to appear around Etruria. It is not clear to historians exactly when trading with the Eastern Mediterranean began, however it is clear that both Phoenicians and Greeks must have been interested in the metal ores of Etruria, causing a rise in popularity of the art trade in these regions. The Etruscans were well known for their art throughout the Orientalizing Period 700-600 BCE, The Archaic Period 600-480 BCE, and the Hellenistic Period 2nd to 1st century BCE. = The discovery = Discovered on November 15, 1553 by construction workers near the San Lorentino gate in Arezzo (ancient Arretium), the sculpture was quickly claimed for the collection of the Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo I, who placed it publicly in the Palazzo Vecchio in the hall of Leo X. Cosimo also placed the smaller bronzes from the trove in his own studiolo at Palazzo Pitti, where \\"the Duke took great pleasure in cleaning them by himself, with some goldsmith's tools,\\" as Benvenuto Cellini reported in his autobiography.Cellini, Benvenuto, and John Addington Symonds. 1955. The autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini. N.Y.: Modern Library. On discovery, the statue was missing the snake and its left front and rear paws. Due to its fragmented state upon discovery, the statue was originally regarded as a lion. Italian painter Giorgio Vasari tracked down the statue motif by studying Ancient Greek and Roman coins, such as a silver stater featuring an image of the Chimera, thus accurately identifying it. Eventually, it was officially identified as being a part of a larger piece illustrating a fight between the Chimera and the Greek hero Bellerophon. The sculpture was found among other small pieces that served as votive offerings to the God Tinia. This sculpture may also have served as an Etruscan religious dedication. After discovery, it began its residence in Florence, where it was moved to the Uffizi Palace in 1718.\\"The Chimaera of Arezzo: July 16, 2009‚ÄìFebruary 8, 2010\\". J. Paul Getty Museum. \\"Discovery\\" Retrieved 21 November 2017 Since 1870, the Chimera of Arezzo has made its home at the National Archaeological Museum in Florence. As the sculpture made its way through the Florence museums, it increasingly attracted the attention of both artists and historians.  Iconography  Typical iconography of the Chimera myth depicts the warrior Bellerophon as he confronts the Chimera, or rides atop or alongside it. This iconography began to appear upon Greek vessels in 600 BCE. The Chimera of Arezzo presents a very detailed and complex composition that most likely was meant for display and viewing in the round. The Chimera is clearly expressing pain throughout its body. Its form is contorted, its face and mouth open in outrage as it is struck by Bellerophon. Similar to Hellenistic sculpture, the Chimera's form and body language express movement as well as the clear tension and power of the beast's musculature and evoke in the viewer a feeling of deep emotional pain and interest in the contemplation of that movement. Clearly influenced by Mediterranean myth culture, this bronze work is evidence of the mastery that Etruscan sculptors had not only over the medium but of mythological lore. Art historian A. Maggiani gives details of a clear Italiote context by pointing out iconographic comparisons from sites in Magna Graecia such as Metaponto and Kaulonia. Italiote refers to a pre-Roman empire Greek-speaking population in southern Italy. Magna Graecia refers to the Greek colonies which were established in southern Italy from the 8th century BCE onwards. With the Italiote context in mind, these trends are a clear indication of the increasing popularity of Attic or Athens-inspired architecture and sculpture. Ancient Athenians regarded themselves among the highest of society. Their art, religion, and culture was seen as the epitome of Greek achievement. While the ancient Athenians had long since perished by this time, their work and way of life were still regarded with great fascination and there was a desire to emulate it. Historians have generally come to a consensus that the Chimera of Arezzo was produced by Italiote craftsmen in the last decades of the fifth century BCE or in the beginning of the fourth century BCE. The fact that this sculpture was a votive offering to Tinia is a reminder of the wealth and sophistication of Etruscan elites.Becker, Jeffery A. ‚ÄúChimera of Arezzo (Article)  Etruscan.‚Äù Khan Academy, www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient- art-civilizations/etruscan/a/chimera-of-arezzo  Methods and materials  In the 3rd millennium BCE ancient foundry workers discovered by trial and error that bronze had distinct advantages over pure copper for making artistic statuary. Bronze stays liquid longer when filling a mold due to its lower melting point. Bronze is a superior metal than copper for sculpture casting because of its higher tensile strength.Hemingway, Authors: Se√°n Hemingway Colette. ‚ÄúThe Technique of Bronze Statuary in Ancient Greece  Essay  Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History  The Metropolitan Museum of Art.‚Äù The Met's Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grbr/hd_grbr.htm. The island of Cyprus supplied most of the bronze used for artistic purposes throughout the ancient Mediterranean region. The earliest forms of Greek bronze sculptures were simple, hand-worked sheets of bronze known as sphyrelaton (literally, ‚Äúhammer-driven‚Äù). Like modern clay sculpture, these metal sheets could be embellished by hammering the metal over various wooden shapes made with textures that created a desired look or depth. This was later adapted to become the technique known today as tracing. By the late Archaic period (ca. 500‚Äì480 B.C.) sphyrelaton lost popularity as lost-wax casting became the primary form of bronze sculpting. Lost-wax casting of bronze was achieved in three different ways, each with its own desired effects. The first and earliest method was solid casting, which required a model of the sculpture to be fashioned in solid wax and then carved. The second method was hollow lost-wax casting, which was created by a direct process. Finally, the third was hollow lost-wax casting by an indirect process. The model is packed in clay, and then heated in what today would be similar to a kiln to remove the wax and harden the clay. Then, the mold is inverted and metal poured inside it to create a cast. When cooled, the bronze-smith cracks open the clay model to reveal a solid bronze replica. For smaller details, sculptors often made eyes out of glass and painted on body hair, clothing details, and skin color. Lost in antiquity, most historical knowledge of how certain bronze statues would have looked comes from studying surviving Roman marble copies.

Henry Mayhew described one bone-grubber he encountered as wearing a \\"ragged coat ... greased over, probably with the fat of the bones he gathered.\\" A rag-and-bone man or ragpicker (UK English) or ragman, old- clothesman, junkman, or junk dealer (US English), also called a bone-grubber, bone-picker, rag-gatherer, bag board, or totter,Regulating the Rag and Bone Man, Law Librarians of Congress collects unwanted household items and sells them to merchants. Traditionally this was a task performed on foot, with the scavenged materials (which included rags, bones and various metals) kept in a small bag slung over the shoulder. Some rag-and-bone men used a cart, sometimes pulled by a horse or pony. In the 19th century, rag-and-bone men typically lived in extreme poverty, surviving on the proceeds of what they collected each day. Conditions improved following the Second World War, but the trade declined during the latter half of the 20th century. However, in more recent years, partly as the result of the soaring price of scrap metal, rag-and-bone men may once again be seen at work in many Third World (as well as some First World) countries. 19th century Rag-and-bone man in Paris in 1899 (Photo Eug√®ne Atget) In the UK, 19th-century rag-and-bone men scavenged unwanted rags, bones, metal and other waste from the towns and cities in which they lived. Henry Mayhew's 1851 report London Labour and the London Poor estimates that in London, between 800 and 1,000 \\"bone-grubbers and rag- gatherers\\" lived in lodging houses, garrets and \\"ill-furnished rooms in the lowest neighbourhoods.\\" These bone-grubbers, as they were sometimes known, would typically spend nine or ten hours searching the streets of London for anything of value, before returning to their lodgings to sort whatever they had found. In rural areas where no rag merchants were present, rag-and-bone men often dealt directly with rag paper makers, but in London they sold rag to the local traders. White rag could fetch two to three pence per pound, depending on condition (all rag had to be dry before it could be sold). Coloured rag was worth about two pence per pound. Bones, worth about the same, could be used as knife handles, toys and ornaments, and, when treated, for chemistry. The grease extracted from them was also useful for soapmaking. Metal was more valuable; an 1836 edition of Chambers's Edinburgh Journal describes how \\"street-grubber[s]\\" could be seen scraping away the dirt between the paving stones of non-macadamised roads, searching for horseshoe nails. Brass, copper and pewter were valued at about four to five pence per pound. In a typical day, a rag-and-bone man might expect to earn about sixpence. Mayhew's report indicates that many who worked as rag-and-bone men did so after falling on hard times, and generally lived in squalor. Although they usually started work well before dawn, they were not immune to the public's ire; in 1872, several rag-and-bone men in Westminster caused complaint when they emptied the contents of two dust trucks to search for rags, bones and paper, blocking people's path. In Paris, ragpickers were regulated by law and could operate only at night. They were required to return unusually valuable items either to the items' owners or to the authorities. When Eug√®ne Poubelle introduced the garbage can in 1884, he was criticised by French newspapers for meddling with the ragpickers' livelihood. 20th century A rag-and-bone man with his horse and cart on the streets of Streatham, southwest London in 1985 A rag-and-bone man in Croydon, London, May 2011 A 1954 report in The Manchester Guardian mentioned that some men could make as much as ¬£25 a day collecting rags. Most used handcarts rather than a bag, and some used a pony and cart, giving out rubbing stones in exchange for the items that they collected. In 1958, a Manchester Guardian reporter accompanied rag-and-bone man John Bibby as he made his rounds through Chorlton and Stretford, near Manchester. For his handcart's load, which comprised rags, furs, shoes, scrap car parts, a settee and other furniture, Bibby made about ¬£2. The rag-and-bone trade fell into decline; in the 1950s, Manchester and Salford had, between them, around 60 rag merchants, but this had fallen to about 12 by 1978, many having moved into the scrap-metal trade. Local merchants blamed several factors, including demographic changes, for the decline of their industry. A 1965 newspaper report estimated that in London, only a \\"few hundred\\" rag-and- bone men remained, possibly because of competition from more specialised trades, such as corporation dustmen, and pressure from property developers to build on rag merchants' premises. In the 1980s, Hollywood star Kirk Douglas mentioned in an interview with Johnny Carson that his father was a ragman in New York and \\"young people nowadays don't know what is ragman.\\" Despite the popularity of the BBC's popular television comedy Steptoe and Son, which helped maintain the rag-and-bone man's status in British folklore, by the 1980s they were mostly gone. In more recent years, rising scrap metal prices have prompted their return, although most drive vans rather than horses and carts, and they announce their presence by megaphone, causing some members of the public to complain about the noise they create.

The border with the Danubian Hills runs approx. along the line Bratislava ‚Äì Senec ‚Äì Sereƒè ‚Äì Nov√© Z√°mky ‚Äì Patince. It has been formed by the arms of the Danube (Little Danube and others) and by the southern V√°h, Nitra and ≈Ωitava rivers. It is filled with huge layers of gravel from the Danube and other rivers of the area. These Danubian gravels are covered with loess and other very fertile soils. The Danube forms here a unique continental delta system of meanders and dead arms. The area between one of those arms called Little Danube and the Danube is known as the ≈Ωitn√Ω ostrov, the biggest river island in Europe. The ≈Ωitn√Ω ostrov is an area with marsh depressions, natural lakes and artificial lakes. The drainage system of the southern area was (deliberately) significantly changed by the construction of the Gabƒç√≠kovo Dam on the Danube. The ≈Ωitn√Ω ostrov has been a \\"Protected Water Management Area\\" since 1978. The area is rich in forest glades, water and marsh fauna and flora. It has rich subterranean water reservoirs. Those in ≈Ωitn√Ω ostrov are among the largest in Central Europe. Warm springs can be found in Kom√°rno, ≈†t√∫rovo and Patince. The area has the warmest and driest climate in Slovakia. This, and the fact that it has fertile soils, make it the ideal place for agriculture. Wheat, sugar beets, sweet corn, vegetables and tobacco are grown here. Fruit and vine growing are also important. The most important towns of the area are the Slovak capital Bratislava (the Danube Flat begins in below Bratislava Castle in central Bratislava), Galanta, Sereƒè, Dunajsk√° Streda, Kom√°rno, and Nov√© Z√°mky.

It is a receptor for fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor and aids platelet activation. The complex is formed via calcium-dependent association of gpIIb and gpIIIa, a required step in normal platelet aggregation and endothelial adherence. Platelet activation by ADP (blocked by clopidogrel) leads to the aforementioned conformational change in platelet gpIIb/IIIa receptors that induces binding to fibrinogen. The gpIIb/IIIa receptor is a target of several drugs including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban. gpIIb/IIIa complex formation Once platelets are activated, granules secrete clotting mediators, including both ADP and TXA2. These then bind their respective receptors on platelet surfaces, in both an autocrine and paracrine fashion (binds both itself and other platelets). The binding of these receptors result in a cascade of events resulting in an increase in intracellular calcium (e.g. via Gq receptor activation leading to Ca2+ release from platelet endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores, which may activate PKC). Hence, this calcium increase triggers the calcium-dependent association of gpIIb and gpIIIa to form the activated membrane receptor complex gpIIb/IIIa, which is capable of binding fibrinogen (factor I), resulting in many platelets \\"sticking together\\" as they may connect to the same strands of fibrinogen, resulting in a clot. The coagulation cascade then follows to stabilize the clot, as thrombin (factor IIa) converts the soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin strands. These strands are then cross-linked by factor XIII to form a stabilized blood clot. Pathology Defects in glycoprotein IIb/IIIa cause Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Autoantibodies against IIb/IIIa can be produced in immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Medicine Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors can be used to prevent blood clots in an effort to decrease the risk of heart attack or stroke.

A Study in the Politics of Reconstruction, National Defense University Press, 1996, pp. 175‚Äì193Charles Kruszewski, \\"The Pivot of History\\", Foreign Affairs, April 1954 In this article, Mackinder extended the scope of geopolitical analysis to encompass the entire globe. The World-Island and the Heartland Map of the \\"Heartland Theory\\", as published by Mackinder in 1904. According to Mackinder, the Earth's land surface was divisible into: *The World-Island, comprising the interlinked continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa (Afro-Eurasia). This was the largest, most populous, and richest of all possible land combinations. *The offshore islands, including the British Isles and the islands of Japan. *The outlying islands, including the continents of North America, South America, and Oceania. The Heartland lay at the centre of the world island, stretching from the Volga to the Yangtze and from the Himalayas to the Arctic. Mackinder's Heartland was the area then ruled by the Russian Empire and after that by the Soviet Union, minus the Kamchatka Peninsula region, which is located in the easternmost part of Russia, near the Aleutian Islands and Kurile islands. Strategic importance of Eastern Europe Later, in 1919, Mackinder summarised his theory thus: :::\\"Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; :::who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island; :::who rules the World- Island commands the world.\\" :::(Mackinder, Democratic Ideals and Reality, p. 150) Any power which controlled the World-Island would control well over 50% of the world's resources. The Heartland's size and central position made it the key to controlling the World-Island. The vital question was how to secure control for the Heartland. This question may seem pointless, since in 1904 the Russian Empire had ruled most of the area from the Volga to Eastern Siberia for centuries. But throughout the nineteenth century: *The West European powers had combined, usually successfully, in the Great Game to prevent Russian expansion. *The Russian Empire was huge but socially, politically and technologically backward‚Äîi.e., inferior in \\"virility, equipment and organization\\". Mackinder held that effective political domination of the Heartland by a single power had been unattainable in the past because: *The Heartland was protected from sea power by ice to the north and mountains and deserts to the south. *Previous land invasions from east to west and vice versa were unsuccessful because lack of efficient transportation made it impossible to assure a continual stream of men and supplies. He outlined the following ways in which the Heartland might become a springboard for global domination in the twentieth century (Sempa, 2000): *Successful invasion of Russia by a West European nation (most probably Germany). Mackinder believed that the introduction of the railroad had removed the Heartland's invulnerability to land invasion. As Eurasia began to be covered by an extensive network of railroads, there was an excellent chance that a powerful continental nation could extend its political control over the Eastern European gateway to the Eurasian landmass. In Mackinder's words, \\"Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland.\\" *A Russo-German alliance. Before 1917 both countries were ruled by autocrats (the Tsar and the Kaiser), and both could have been attracted to an alliance against the democratic powers of Western Europe (the US was isolationist regarding European affairs, until it became a participant of World War I in 1917). Germany would have contributed to such an alliance its formidable army and its large and growing sea power. *Conquest of Russia by a Sino-Japanese empire (see below). The combined empire's large East Asian coastline would also provide the potential for it to become a major sea power. Mackinder's \\"Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland ...\\" does not cover this scenario, probably because the previous 2 scenarios were seen as the major risks of the nineteenth century and the early 1900s. One of Mackinder's personal objectives was to warn Britain that its traditional reliance on sea power would become a weakness as improved land transport opened up the Heartland for invasion and / or industrialisation (Sempa, 2000). Influence of the theory on other geopolitical models Colour representation, using a modern projection of the world.Signs of Mackinder's Heartland Theory can be found in the works of geopolitician Dimitri Kitsikis, particularly in his \\"Intermediate Region\\" model. There is a significant geographical overlap between the Heartland or \\"Pivot Area\\" and the Intermediate Region, with the exception of Germany-Prussia and north-eastern China, which Kitsikis excludes from the Intermediate Region. Mackinder, on the other hand, excludes North Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East from the Heartland. The reason for this difference is that Mackinder's model is primarily geo-strategic, while Kitsikis' model is geo-civilizational. However, the roles of both the Intermediate Region and the Heartland are regarded by their respective authors as being pivotal in the shaping of world history. Criticism K. S. Gadzhev, in his book Vvedenie v geopolitiku (Introduction to Geopolitics) raises a series of objections to Mackinder's Heartland to start with that the significance physiography is given there for political strategy is a form of geographical determinism.Anita Sengupta, Heartlands of Eurasia: The Geopolitics of Political Space, Lexington Books, 2009 See also * Intermediate Region * The Grand Chessboard * Land hemisphere * The Nazis Strike * Rimland * Mainland invasion of the United States ReferencesFurther reading * CIA's Analysis of the Soviet Union, 1947‚Äì1991 links to a large number of CIA analyses of Soviet economic, technological and military capability (as well as e.g. foreign policy), all in PDF format. *Christopher, J.F. \\"Sir Halford Mackinder, Geopolitics, and Policymaking in the 21st Century\\", Parameters, Summer 2000 * Mackinder, H.J. \\"The Geographical Pivot of History\\", in \\"Democratic Ideals and Reality\\", Washington, DC: National Defense University Press, 1996, pp. 175‚Äì193. * Odom, W.E.

History=Origin= Punchboards were originally used in the 18th century for gambling purposes. A local tavern owner would construct a game board out of wood, drill small holes in it, and fill each hole with a small paper ticket or gamepiece. The holes were then typically covered with paper or foil. After a patron bought a chance at the punchboard, he would puncture one of the hole's paper or foil covers with a nail and retrieve the ticket/gamepiece. If the gamepiece contained a winning number, the patron won the prize. In the nineteenth century, board operators eventually drilled into their own holes (they knew where the big money was because they made the board). The punchboard's use started to decline. =Paper punchboard= In the late 1800s, a new type of punchboard was introduced. This one involved putting paper in both the front and back of the hole (to help prevent operators from cheating). These new punchboards became popular purchases at drugstores, and they were sold with a metal stylus. The punchboard soon became increasingly similar to today's lottery tickets. Soon, the punchboard became cheap and easy to assemble, and the industry flourished. Noted gambling author John Scarne estimates that 30 million punchboards were sold in the years between 1910 and 1915. He also estimates that 50 million punchboards were sold in 1939 alone, during the peak of their popularity. =After World War II= After World War II, use of the punchboard as a gambling tool began to decline because many people frowned at its gambling-like nature, and the punchboard was outlawed in many states. The use of punchboards for advertisement started to gain popularity. Many companies started hiding goods such as bottles of beer and cigarettes inside punchboards. Zippo lighters reportedly sold more than 300,000 lighters through punchboard advertising between 1934 and 1940. Larceny People have been cheating on punchboards ever since they were first invented. Many operators know where the big prize holes are; they used to create punchboards with very few holes so they could easily track the big money. Other gamblers could make a dirty deal with the customers: give the customer a \\"map\\" of where the big prizes are on the punchboard.

He is known for his red face, white dreadlocks, dinosaur-head shoulder pads and reptile feet. The name \\"Flattus\\" is indicative of the character's signature flatuence. His speaking mannerisms suggest a childlike intelligence and naivety. The role of Flattus Maximus was played by six different people before it was retired. Dewey Rowell was the first to take the role. A sculptor, Jeffrey Rumaner, nicknamed \\"Stretch\\" played Flattus in the scenes to the video \\"Gor-Gor\\". Pete Lee played him in This Toilet Earth. Tim Harriss portrayed him during the 1998 Halloween Tour and for the recording of We Kill Everything. Zach Blair took over the role in 1999 for the recording of Violence Has Arrived. Cory Smoot took over the role in 2002 and continued to portray the character until his death on November 3, 2011. After Smoot's death, the band made the decision to officially retire the character in his honor. Gwar lore Very little about Flattus Maximus is explained in Gwar lore. Even his home planet is an uncertainty; in an interview conducted during a 1997 tour, Flattus (at the time portrayed by Pete Lee) explained his hazy memory was due to his notorious pot smoking, at which point he seemed to recall a planet named Pot (made entirely of cannabis) he once called home, but he ended up destroying it by smoking the entire planet out of existence. Although his explanation was never officially set in stone, it's one of many theories as to where Flattus really originates from. What is apparent, though, is that he is illiterate, has a slight Southern accent, and that he attributes his \\"explosive guitar style\\" to a strict diet of vegetarians, which also causes his infamous atomic flatulence. Following Smoot's death in 2011, the band explained the character's absence by claiming that Flattus stole Gwar's spaceship in order to return to his home planet, Planet Home. Flattus' history The first man to portray the \\"armored clown\\" (taken from the pre-2005 web bio) was Dewey Rowell, who played on Hell-O and Scumdogs of the Universe. He left the band shortly after the \\"Tour De Scum\\" tape, and before America Must Be Destroyed, Gwar's third album, was recorded. Until mid-1992, after Gwar's Phallus In Wonderland was released, the Flattus Maximus character was absent. America Must Be Destroyed had all of its guitar parts (save two solos) played by Balsac the Jaws of Death. When playing those songs live, in particular \\"The Road Behind\\", it was typically Balsac, not Flattus, who played the lead. For the filming of Phallus in Wonderland Jeffrey Rumaner, a sculptor friend of the band, who goes by the name of \\"Stretch,\\" played Flattus in the few scenes in which he was featured (the video for \\"Gor- Gor\\" features Stretch falling off of a building, and he plays piano in \\"Have You Seen Me?\\"). Flattus Maximus live on stage After a mini-tour in early 1992, Peter Lee was hired, at the recommendation of Ministry guitarist Mike Scaccia, as the new guitarist (Scaccia had turned them down to continue working with Ministry - Scaccia and Lee were both in a band together, along with future Gwar bassist Casey Orr; it was Lee who enlisted Orr in 1994). He first played on This Toilet Earth. In 1993, Lee was shot in an attempted carjacking, and was unable to film much of \\"Skulhedface\\" due to injuries to his stomach. He did manage to film a commercial segment with Dave Brockie, where Lee first suggested the idea of police officers (both were dressed as policemen) playing rock music. This turned into Gwar's first true spin-off band, X-Cops. One music video from that period, \\"Jack The World,\\" features Lee as Flattus, and he is seen wearing a colostomy bag, which he also wore during a brief tour in October 1993. Lee played on the next two albums, RagNaRok and Carnival of Chaos, and was in the films from that time frame (1995-late 1997), \\"Rendezvous With RagNaRok\\" and \\"Dawn of the Day of the Night of the Penguins.\\" In the interview segments of \\"Rendezvous...,\\" Flattus is seen more than any other character (the others were a paranormal investigator played by Bob Gorman, Beefcake the Mighty, Balsac the Jaws of Death and Techno Destructo), and it is here where the childlike mannerisms truly surface. Lee left in December 1997, due to his recurring stomach problems stemming from the carjacking. His leaving of Gwar also forced the dissolution of the X-Cops. In 1998, there again was no Flattus for some time. When Gwar's 1998 Halloween tour came around, Michael Bishop, who was filling in for Casey Orr as Beefcake, suggested Tim Harriss (who had previously played one Gwar show twelve years prior) of his band Kepone. Harriss would remain the Flattus character through the recording of We Kill Everything. In 1999, after Orr returned, and before We Kill Everything was released, Gwar auditioned several guitarists for the role of Flattus Maximus. Zach Blair won the part, and became the reptilian cro-mag guitarist. He is seen in the film \\"It's Sleazy,\\" and the music video for \\"Fuckin' An Animal,\\" the last song on We Kill Everything. In 2001, Gwar, with Blair on guitar, recorded Violence Has Arrived, from which one music video, the concert favorite \\"Immortal Corrupter,\\" was recorded. However, Blair was not featured in the \\"Immortal Corrupter\\" video, and was replaced by Tim Harriss for the video shoot. Blair, along with Casey Orr, left after the Blood Drive 2nd Campaign Tour (the second tour for Violence Has Arrived). In September 2002, a new Flattus was needed, and Cory Smoot (Mensrea/Locus Factor), who had previously auditioned in 1999, was recruited. Smoot, being a talented producer, lent his technical skills to the recording of War Party, and co-produced, as well as co-mixed with Devin Townsend (Steve Vai/Strapping Young Lad) Gwar's 2006 release, titled Beyond Hell. The two albums were recorded at Karma Studios, owned and operated by Smoot. Smoot has been the longest running Flattus thus and is in the videos for \\"War Party\\", \\"Bring Back The Bomb\\", \\"Womb With A View\\", \\"School's Out\\" and \\"Eighth Lock\\". Smoot is considered by Gwar fans to be the \\"True Flattus\\", as he is the longest serving person to portray the character in Gwar history. Smoot also produced the follow-up to Beyond Hell, Lust in Space, along with other members of Gwar, and even sang lead vocals on the track \\"Release the Flies\\". Smoot's final Gwar album, Bloody Pit of Horror, features a 12-minute epic of four songs strung together, which was largely the brainchild of Smoot. Originally he wrote the music for a solo project of his, but by the suggestion of Dave Brockie, it was reworked to become new Gwar material. Death of Cory Smoot and retirement of Flattus On November 3, 2011, hours after a performance at First Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Smoot was found dead by his fellow band members in the band's tour bus as they prepared to cross the border into Manitoba, Canada from North Dakota. A medical examiner concluded that Smoot died from \\"coronary artery thrombosis brought about by his pre-existing coronary artery disease\\". On November 4, Dave Brockie officially announced that the character of Flattus Maximus would be retired out of respect to Smoot. Costume evolution Cory Smoot as Flattus Maximus in 2004 Flattus began life with a helmet with large horns, dinosaur-skull shoulder pads, a painted red face and long dreadlocks. During the 1990 Tour De Scum, Flattus' helmet changed into something resembling the horns of a ram, but this was a short-lived change. Two of Flattus' three appearances in \\"Phallus In Wonderland\\" used his \\"Scumdogs\\" helmet (the second of the three, the video for \\"Have You Seen Me?,\\" has him wearing a tuxedo, and no armor whatsoever). The second incarnation did away with the helmet, and the shoulder pads were enlarged. By \\"RagNaRok,\\" the shoulder pads were brown dinosaur heads instead of skulls, and he had a tail and loincloth (scaly and brown). His face was still red, but was a mask, and his dreadlocks were shorter and stuck out like a palm tree. His shoulder pads changed slightly for \\"Carnival of Chaos,\\" and would be the last change until after \\"We Kill Everything\\" was recorded. \\"We Kill Everything\\" has a photo of Flattus (presumably Michael Derks in said costume), and he is more or less the same (it is the same costume), minus the tail and taller. Blair's Flattus is the most drastic change: the shoulder pads became green (with some exposed bone and muscle, but mostly scale), the tail reappears (for the \\"WKE\\" photo shoot, Derks did not wear one), and, like the feet, shoulder pads and loincloth, is green and scaly. The face is less comical, and more like a bulldog (still red, though). The dreadlocks are white, and at their shortest. In the \\"Fuckin' An Animal\\" video, Blair's Flattus costume featured a tail, though in subsequent tours and videos it did not. Smoot's changes to the costume (to coincide with War Party) were mostly in the face and hair. The face is larger and more distorted, and the dreadlocks are white and black, and are pulled back. They are also considerably longer than before. The tail is gone. The shoulderpads are a bit larger and longer, whereas Blair's were more compact. Beyond Hell-era Flattus has grey shoulderpads, green feet and a slightly redesigned face. The face closer depicts a Cro-Magnon (or Gwar's take on one), which fits Flattus' current description of himself (\\"It is me Flattus Maximus your reptilian/cro-mag/alien of flatulance and fury.\\" Taken from his Oct. 18, 2005 blog entry), as well as the pre-historic theme of the costume.

This nonrestrictive nature of the fund has been a source of some criticism though. Local leadership acknowledges that throughout the life of the MAGIC Fund it has been a challenge maintain openness with the public about specific spending while at the same time respecting the confidentiality of business information.

March 27, 2005. pg A1 The MAGIC Fund has a rich history of aiding economic development in the Minot region, and study after study shows the local economy has benefited drastically from its availability. Historically MAGIC Funds have been used in three main areas of primary sector economic development: knowledge-based employment, agriculture and energy. Five of the ten largest employers conducting business in Minot today were recruited using MAGIC Funds. Choice Hotels International was one of the first businesses to be recruited using the MAGIC Fund in November 1990, selecting Minot as the location for the company's largest reservation center. Eight years of particularly high productivity later, Choice capitalized on the advantages of the area again and began construction on a $1 million expansion to bring the number of year-round employees in Minot to over 400. Once again, the MAGIC Fund played a big role. In the years between, other service centers such as Sykes in 1996, were attracted to Minot. Drawn also by the MAGIC Fund, Sykes Enterprises came to North Minot's technology park to offer technical support to customers of major companies such as Fortune 500 firms. Sykes notes the level of technology-based education in local schools such as Minot State University have proven extremely important to Sykes‚Äô success in Minot. In 1998, after searching 29 cities nationwide, Minneapolis-based ReliaStar (now ING Service Center) made the decision to expand its financial services company to Minot, ND with a new service center employing 400 full-time workers. In February 2000, the company expanded its Minot work force from 450 to 600 workers thanks to the financial assistance provided by the City of Minot's MAGIC Fund. MLT Inc., a Northwest Airlines Corporation company, was offered one of the most aggressive incentives packages at the time and it soon followed suit by coming to Minot in 1999 and a year later expanded their workforce to approximately 600 as well. Local businesses such as Midwest Telemark International (MTI) have also flourished with the help of the non- provincial MAGIC Fund. Started by two entrepreneurs in Mohall, ND, MTI now has employs over 450 people in seven centers in rural communities including Bottineau, Kenmare, Stanley, Beulah, Langdon, and Grafton.2002 annual report Companies often cite an available, quality workforce and infrastructure for why they chose Minot to conduct business and expand. In the communications world, this necessary infrastructure is seen in the form of a sophisticated telecommunications network, offering fiber optic and high-speed internet access. Locally owned SRT Communications offers just that, as well as phone service to the Minot area. State-of-the-art systems are in place to support these expanding businesses, but without the MAGIC Fund which helped fuel the growth of the communications business throughout the area, they may not have seen the need to upgrade so rapidly.2002 annual report Continual capital investments in infrastructure keep the city prime for expansion. Other areas of development include value-added agriculture. In 1994 Bourgault Industries was recruited to Minot with the availability of MAGIC Funds, although the Saskatchewan-based agriculture equipment manufacturer did not in the end need to use the funding. By 1995 construction was complete and the facility was up and running as the main office for Bourgault's U.S. assembly, marketing and distribution center. Bourgault Industries recently announced (2008) expansion to bring several production lines to Minot, creating 20-30 new jobs in the area. Similarly, in 1996, Minot Milling (a division of Philadelphia Macaroni Company) came to Minot with the help of the MAGIC Fund although it turned out the company did not need monetary assistance.Schramm, Jill. ‚ÄúPublic shares advice for MAGIC Fund‚Äù.

MedVision, for example, came to Minot in 1997 and left a year later after only creating several jobs. It took several years for the MAGIC Fund to recover the $2 million loan in full. WebSmart Interactive, initially a provider of telemarketing sales verification was founded at the height of the internet boom. After a short period of rapid growth WebSmart began outgoing sales calls, the primary client of which was a Georgia-based company.

One such study, conducted in 2001 by the Economic Strategy Center Inc. of Atlanta, Georgia found that for every 10 jobs created through MAGIC Funding, approximately 8.5 additional jobs are created in the area. Further, for every dollar earned through MAGIC Fund activity, an additional 70 cents was added to the local economy.Witte, Brian. ‚ÄúStudy shows positive results.‚Äù Minot Daily News. June 5, 2001. p A1. The balance of the fund grew, but officials wanted to implement changes to further decrease the risk involved in assisting ventures. After the 2002 mayoral election, a 3-man committee was appointed by Mayor Curt Zimbelman to study issues such as repeat failure to meet job creation targets with no clear penalties for such actions and the conditions that MAGIC Fund grants were disbursed under being ignored and to create a new set of guidelines. The new guidelines were officially approved by the city council. [Needs Citation] Recent events MAGIC funds are currently being utilized in three major area projects. The MAGIC Fund has supported all of these projects through payments directly related to building permanent infrastructure such as water and roads. In the future, the Fund plans to continue supporting infrastructure grants and loans. The first of its kind in the state, intermodal transportation facility The Port of North Dakota is in the works in northeast Minot. The Port anticipates to benefit businesses in an approximate radius of Minot stretching into Montana, South Dakota and Saskatchewan by offering identity preserved bulk transportation at the intersection of two Class One railroads, two major state highways and airport runway facilities, all near the geographical center of North America. Construction began in 2006 (citation), and in March, the project took a huge step forward when BNSF Railway announced its cooperation with a proposed statewide rail strategy to reduce rates for containers of bulk commodities shipped from the Minot and Fargo-Dilworth areas. Another major project the MAGIC Fund is aiding in is in the Value-added Ag Complex, an agri-business park also located in northeast Minot. Minot Milling, anchor tenant of the complex, recently celebrated its tenth anniversary of operations in Minot and was named the recipient of the Corporate Citizenship Award for its years of service to the community and for being such a valuable asset to the Ag Complex. In late September 2008, California-based C&F; Foods closed on the purchase of MG Grain, an unfinished lentil processing facility in the Ag Park. The third major project aided by the MAGIC Fund is the Great Plains Energy Park.City of Minot Finance Department.

One of the piers from the Great Palace, now in the courtyard of the Istanbul Archaeological Museums The Great Palace of Constantinople (, M√©ga Pal√°tion; Latin: Palatium Magnum, Turkish: B√ºy√ºk Saray), also known as the Sacred Palace (, Hier√≤n Pal√°tion; Latin: Sacrum Palatium), was the large Imperial Byzantine palace complex located in the south-eastern end of the peninsula now known as Old Istanbul (formerly Constantinople), in modern Turkey. It served as the main royal residence of the Eastern Roman or Byzantine emperors until 1081 and was the centre of imperial administration for over 690 years. Only a few remnants and fragments of its foundations have survived into the present day. History When Constantine I refounded Byzantium as Constantinople in 330, he planned out a palace for himself. The palace was located between the Hippodrome and Hagia Sophia. The complex of palaces was rebuilt and expanded several times during its history. Much of the complex was destroyed during the Nika riots of 532 and was rebuilt lavishly by the emperor Justinian I. Further extensions and alterations were commissioned by Justinian II and Basil I. However, it had fallen into disrepair by the time of Constantine VII, who ordered its renovation. From the early 11th century onwards the Byzantine emperors favored the Palace of Blachernae as an imperial residence, though they continued to use the Great Palace as the primary administrative and ceremonial center of the city. It declined substantially during the following century when parts of the complex were demolished or filled with rubble. During the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade, the Palace was plundered by the soldiers of Boniface of Montferrat. Although the subsequent Latin emperors continued to use the Palace complex, they lacked money for its maintenance. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went as far as removing the lead roofs of the Palace and selling them. Consequently, when the city was retaken by the forces of Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261, the Great Palace was in disrepair. The Palaiologos emperors largely abandoned it, ruling from Blachernae and using the vaults as a prison. When Mehmed II entered the city in 1453, he found the palace ruined and abandoned. As he wandered its empty halls and pavilions, he allegedly whispered a quote from the Persian poet, Saadi: Much of the palace was demolished in the general rebuilding of Constantinople in the early years of the Ottoman era. The area was initially turned into housing with a number of small mosques before Sultan Ahmet I demolished the remnants of the Daphne and Kathisma Palaces to build the Sultan Ahmed Mosque and its adjoining buildings. The site of the Great Palace began to be investigated in the late 19th century and an early 20th-century fire uncovered a section of the Great Palace. On this site prison cells, many large rooms, and possibly tombs were found. =Excavations= Initial excavations were carried out by French archaeologists at the Palace of Manganae between 1921-23. A much larger excavation was carried out by the University of St Andrews in 1935 to 1938. Further excavations took place under the directorship of David Talbot Rice from 1952 to 1954, which uncovered a section of one of the south-western buildings at the Arasta Bazaar. The archaeologists discovered a spectacular series of wall and floor mosaics which have been conserved in the Great Palace Mosaic Museum. Excavations are continuing elsewhere, but so far, less than one quarter of the total area covered by the palace has been excavated; total excavation is not presently feasible as most of the palace currently lies underneath the Sultan Ahmed Mosque and other Ottoman-era buildings. Description Map of the administrative heart of Constantinople. The structures of the Great Palace are shown in their approximate position as derived from literary sources. Surviving structures are in black. The Palace was located in the southeastern corner of the peninsula where Constantinople is situated, behind the Hippodrome and the Hagia Sophia. The Palace is considered by scholars to have been a series of pavilions, much like the Ottoman-era Topkapƒ± Palace that succeeded it. The total surface area of the Great Palace exceeded . It stood on a steeply sloping hillside that descends nearly from the Hippodrome to the shoreline, which necessitated the construction of large substructures and vaults. The palace complex occupied six distinct terraces descending to the shore. The main entrance to the Palace quarter was the Chalke (Bronze) gate at the Augustaion. The Augustaion was located on the south side of the Hagia Sophia, and it was there that the city's main street, the Mese (\\"Middle Street\\"), began. To the east of the square lay the Senate house or Palace of Magnaura, where the University was later housed, and to the west the Milion (the mile marker, from which all distances were measured), and the old Baths of Zeuxippus. Immediately behind the Chalke Gate, facing southwards, were the barracks of the palace guards, the Scholae Palatinae. After the barracks stood the reception hall of the 19 Accubita (\\"Nineteen Couches\\"), followed by the Palace of Daphne, in early Byzantine times the main imperial residence. It included the Octagon, the emperor's bedchamber. From the Daphne, a passage led directly to the imperial box (kathisma) in the Hippodrome. The main throne room was the Chrysotriklinos, built by Justin II, and expanded and renovated by Basil I, with the palatine chapel of the Theotokos of the Pharos nearby. To its north lay the Triconchos palace, built by the emperor Theophilos and accessible through a semicircular antechamber known as the Sigma. To the east of the Triconchos lay the lavishly decorated Nea Ekklesia (\\"New Church\\"), built by Basil I, with five gilded domes. The church survived until after the Ottoman conquest. It was used as a gunpowder magazine and exploded when it was struck by lightning in 1490. Between the church and the sea walls lay the polo field of the Tzykanisterion. Further to the south, detached from the main complex lay the seaside palace of Bucoleon.

Devil's Backbone is located within the Willow Springs section of the Ava- Cassville-Willow Springs Ranger District, of the Mark Twain National Forest, near Willow Springs, Missouri. It was named for a prominent ridge down the center of the area. Horseback riding is popular on a network of trails in the wilderness. Devils Backbone offers a variety of recreational activities for visitors. In the spring season, dogwood, redbud, and serviceberry trees are flowering in full force. Then, in fall the foliage of the oaks, sassafras, and red maples begin to turn a vast array of reds, yellows, and oranges. The North Fork River is also main attraction for visitors to the area. There are three springs within Devils Backbone that feed the North Fork (Blue, Amber, and McGarr). There is even a canoe launch for the river which offers smallmouth bass, blue gill, and rock bass angling opportunities. For those interested in wildlife, White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana), red and grey fox (Vulpes vulpes and Urycyon cinereoargenteus), bobcats (Lynx rufus), skunks (Mephitis mephitis), squirrels (Sciurus niger and S. carolinensis), coyotes (Canis latrans), and raccoons (Procyon lotor) can be seen roaming the limestone glades.

The Bouma Sequence (after Arnold H. Bouma, 1932‚Äì2011) describes a classic set of sedimentary structures in turbidite beds deposited by turbidity currents at the bottoms of lakes, oceans and rivers. Description The Bouma sequence specifically describes the ideal vertical succession of structures deposited by low-density (i.e., low sand concentration, fine-grained) turbidity currents. An alternate classification scheme that is generally called the Lowe sequence exists for the ideal vertical sequence of structures deposited by high-density flows. The Bouma sequence is divided into 5 distinct layers labelled A through E, with A being at the bottom and E being at the top. Each layer described by Bouma has a specific set of sedimentary structures and a specific lithology (see below), with the layers overall getting finer-grained from bottom to top. Most turbidites found in nature have incomplete sequences - Bouma describes the ideal sequence where all layers are present. The layers are as follows. * E: Massive, ungraded mudstone, sometimes with evidence of trace fossils (i.e., bioturbation). The Bouma E layer is often missing, or difficult to differentiate from the Bouma D layer below. * D: Parallel-laminated siltstone. * C: Ripple-laminated fine-grained sandstone. Often the ripple laminations are deformed into convolute laminations and flame structures. * B: Planar- laminated fine- to medium-grained sandstone. The base of Bouma B often has features known as sole markings, such as flute casts, groove casts and parting lineation. * A: Massive to normally graded, fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, often with pebbles and/or rip-up clasts of shale near the base. Dish structures may be present. The base of the sandstone, below A, is sometimes eroded into underlying strata. Processes The Bouma sequence is deposited during waning flow as turbidity currents move downslope. In other words, flows steadily lose energy as they react to changes in the slope of the surface over which they travel, and/or as flows move from being confined within a channel to unconfined when they exit the channel and spread out. Surges and/or hydraulic jumps caused by changes in slope can reinvigorate flows briefly to increase flow energy, but ultimately energy decreases as flows move away from their points of origin. When energy within a flow is highest, it can carry the maximum amount of sediment and the largest grain sizes, but as energy decreases, the carrying capacity reduces, and the coarsest grains quickly settle out, sometimes almost instantaneously. High-energy flows may also erode into underlying beds, thereby incorporating new material into the flow, which will tend to decrease flow energy. Flows in channels can also undergo flow stripping, in which the upper part of the flow, where the finer grains tend to concentrate, separates and travels out over the top of the channel, leaving the lower part of the flow, where the coarser grains accumulate, within the channel. Ultimately, only clay particles remain, suspended in a stagnant water column with essentially no current movement. As flows move downslope the following processes take place to create the layers of the Bouma sequence. * Bouma E is the last layer deposited. It results from suspension settling where essentially no current exists. Clays generally remain suspended until the water chemistry changes and allows the clays to flocculate and settle out. Because the Bouma E layer, if deposited at all, is easily eroded by subsequent turbidity currents, it is often not present. * Bouma D is deposited by suspension settling where a slight current exists. Subtle changes in current energy causes alternating laminations of coarser and finer grains of silt to settle out. * Bouma C is deposited under lower flow regime conditions where there is enough energy for the flow to carry fine sand by saltation, wherein grains hop and bounce across the surface beneath the flow. As grains settle out, current ripples develop, with climbing ripples developing if sedimentation rates are high enough. If shear is imposed on the ripple beds by an earthquake and/or by an overlying turbidite/turbidity current, the ripple laminations can be deformed into convolute laminations and flame structures. * Bouma B is deposited under upper flow regime conditions where energy is high enough to carry sand grains by traction, wherein they slide and roll across the surface beneath the flow. The current energy is such that sole marks such as groove casts, flute casts and parting lineation can form on top the bed beneath the flow, and be preserved as molds and casts on the underside of the Bouma B layer. * Bouma A is the first layer deposited by a flow, provided the flow has sufficient energy. Otherwise Bouma B, C or D will be the first layer deposited. Bouma A is deposited when the flow energy is high enough that fluid turbulence is able to keep the coarsest grains in suspension. When energy drops below a critical level, the grains tend to settle out all at once to create a massive bed. If flow energy drops more slowly, then the coarse grains may settle out first, leaving the fine grains still in suspension. This results in coarse-tail graded bedding, which means that there is a bimodal distribution of grain sizes with the coarse grains becoming progressively smaller towards the top of the bed, and the finer grains being randomly distributed between the coarse grains (i.e., the finer grain sizes are ungraded). As grains settle out, water displaced by grain compaction can move upward to create dish structures. Also, erosion can take place at the base of the flow and tear up shale from an underlying bed so that shale-rip clasts are incorporated into the base of the Bouma A layer. If there is some buoyancy to the rip-up clasts, then they may form a layer some distance above the base of Bouma A.

He is one of the most widely known and widely respected referees in the history of rugby league. Pearce, born in Newtown, New South Wales, was originally more interested in cricket but that changed to rugby league due to his fascination with the rules and interpretations of the rules of rugby league. He began refereeing in 1946, promoted to first grade fixtures towards the end of the 1947 season. He then took charge of nine test matches between 1960 and 1967, three World Cup matches in 1968 and six Grand Finals, his first being in 1955 and then the others between 1964 and 1968. He enjoyed a career of 343 first grade games. He was authoritative yet he allowed the game to flow. He had a keen relationship with the players where they would show him respect due to his fair and consistent decision making. His motto was that rugby league referees should \\"eat, sleep and drink the rules of rugby league.\\" He was elected to the Rugby League Referee's Examination Board in 1951. After his retirement from rugby league refereeing he had a long career as a rugby league commentator in the Sydney electronic and print media, with 2UE, Channel 7 and The Sydney Morning Herald.

Le cygne, , or The Swan, is the 13th and penultimate movement of The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns. Originally scored for solo cello accompanied by two pianos, it has been arranged and transcribed for many instruments but remains best known as a cello solo. Music The piece is in 6/4 time, with a key signature of G major and a tempo marking andantino grazioso. The slow cello melody is accompanied by almost constant broken chord figurations on the pianos. When performed as a separate movement, not in the context of The Carnival, The Swan is frequently played with accompaniment on only one piano. This is the only movement from The Carnival of the Animals that the composer allowed to be played in public during his lifetime. He thought the remaining movements were too frivolous and would damage his reputation as a serious composer. Because of its slow tempo and mostly legato performance indications, the movement is suitable for performance on the theremin and has joined Sergei Rachmaninoff's Vocalise and Jules Massenet's M√©ditation from his opera Tha√Øs among the classical works central to the theremin repertoire. Uses in choreography Le cygne is often known as The Dying Swan, after a poem by Tennyson. Inspired by swans that she had seen in public parks, Anna Pavlova worked with choreographer Michel Fokine, who had read the poem, to create the famous 1905 solo ballet dance which is now closely associated with this music. According to tradition, the swan in Pavlova's dance is badly injured and dying. However, Maya Plisetskaya re-interpreted the swan simply as elderly and stubbornly resisting the effects of aging; much like herself (she performed The Swan at a gala on her 70th birthday). Eventually the piece came to be considered one of Pavlova's trademarks. In 1949 the American synchronized swimmer Beulah Gundling created a routine inspired by Fokine's choreography and entitled The swan to Le cygne by Saint-Sa√´ns.Michael Heim, Exploring Iowa Highways, Wabasha 2006, page 88. Information about the book on Google website. Transcriptions and adaptations In the 1890s, Louis van Waefelghem adapted Le cygne for viola or viola d'amore and piano. The edition was published by Durand in 1895. In Leonard Bernstein's famous recording of the piece with the New York Philharmonic the melody is performed on double bass by a 20-year-old Gary Karr. Montserrat Caball√© recorded a version in which she vocalizes sections of the melody accompanied by a piano. In the early 20th century, Clara Rockmore, the renowned thereminist, performed it on theremin with her sister Nadia Reisenberg accompanying her on the piano. Steven Mead arranged the piece for Euphonium and Piano in 1995, in the key of E‚ô≠ Major. Tony Renis created lyrics for Le Cygne to create the song ‚ÄúNotte Stellata‚Äù that appeared on Italian pop-opera trio Il Volo‚Äôs self-titled debut album.

The descent, in length, is constructed of laid cobblestones and connects Old Kyiv (Upper city) with Podil (Lower city). It starts at the end of Volodymyrska Street and winds down steeply around the Zamkova Hora hill, ending near the Kontraktova Square. The Andriyivskyy Descent is marked by a couple historic landmarks, including the Castle of Richard the Lionheart, the 18th century baroque Saint Andrew's Church, famed Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakov's house, and numerous other monuments. Recent talk of the descent's reconstruction has been going since 2006, when a local grassroots organization aimed at saving the Andriyivskyy Descent collected more than 1,000 signatures to petition local authorities to take action on the descent's reconstruction. On June 23, 2009, the Kyiv City Council administration approved the reconstruction of the Andriyivskyi Descent, which was officially announced a year earlier by Mayor Leonid Chernovetsky. The exact timeline for reconstruction has not yet been adopted, although the reconstruction's budget has been drafted in the city's 2010 budget. Description Numerous tourist shops and art galleries line the sidewalks of the Andriyivskyy Descent. The Andriyivskyy Descent begins on the summit of the Starokyivska Hora (Old Kyiv mountain) near the ornate late-baroque Saint Andrew's Church (which gave the street its current name). The street continues on down and descends to the Podil district where it ends at the Kontraktova Square. In the past times, the descent was known as the Borychiv Descent mentioned as \\"Borichev uvoz\\" (Old East Slavic: –ë–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ–≤ —É–≤–æ–∑) by Nestor the Chronicler in his Primary Chronicle and in the 12th century poem, The Tale of Igor's Campaign (Slovo o polku Ihorevim). The descent's current name is derived from the 18th century, at the time when the Saint Andrew's Church was erected atop the hill. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the street was mainly inhabited by merchants and craftspeople. Although they are long gone due to the sweeping demographic changes in Kyiv during times of the late Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, the street is once again thriving thanks to its unique topology, architecture, rich history and also many gift shops and small art galleries showcasing various paintings and sculptures by Ukrainian artists. The descent is one of the favorite spots for tourists. It is also notable for the many festivals it holds, including various art festivals and the Kyiv Day celebrations on the last weekend of May. The street's location in the city and its landmark attraction has made it lately a highly prestigious area, with several new luxurious restaurants. However, the descent's sewer and water systems have not been upgraded within the past 100 years, thereby underlining the need for a new system to be installed. Although, city authorities have not yet scheduled a new sewer project system to be installed. History St. Andrew's Church seen during World War II. Note the two cupolas on the building adjacent to the church; they have since been removed during Soviet times. The descent, located between two hills, is the shortest passageway from the historic Old or Upper Town (; Kniazivs‚Äôka Hora) to the commercial Podil neighborhood. One of the hills, known as Uzdyhal‚Äônytsia, was the place where pre-Christian idols once stood (see: Baptism of Kyiv), and another hill, called Zamkova Hora, served as a castle hill during the Middle Ages. For many centuries, this passageway was very steep and inconvenient, that's the reason why there were not any settlements for a long time. The first buildings were erected here only in the 17th century, and the first apartment buildings began appearing towards the end of the 19th century. In 1711, by the order of then-Governor of Kyiv, the route between the Zamkova and Andriyivskyy mountains were expanded, thus allowing traffic to become more suitable for horses and wagon carriages. The Andriyivskyy Descent was renamed in 1920 in honor of young revolutionary Georgiy Liver. In 1944, it was decided to return the street to its prior name; in 1957, the street was renamed back to Andreevsky Spusk‚Äîthe Russian variant of Andriyivskyy Descent. In the 1980s, the Andriyivskyy Descent received a thorough reconstruction after years of disrepair. On April 9, 2012, construction workers began demolishing legally protected historic structures, even though earlier that year, their safety was guaranteed at several news conferences and the buildings themselves were included in scale models of the \\"renovated\\" descent. The destruction of the buildings took place under the guise of \\"reconstruction\\" efforts, which began in October 2011. Preliminary reports indicate that the buildings directly across from, and next to the Museum of Bulgakov, (Buildings 10a, 10b, and 9/11) were all razed to the ground. The land was being redeveloped to make room for a new office and business complex to house Rinat Akhmetov's Kyiv operations. Several hundred protestors, including boxer/politician Vitali Klitschko, gathered outside the main Kyiv office of Akhmetov‚Äôs SCM Holdings. On April 12, Akhmetov claimed he had canceled plans to build a multi-story business center in the buildings‚Äô place, promising instead to build a cultural center and restore the facades.Demolition on Andriyivsky Uzviz brings criticism, rethink by billionaire Akhmetov, Kyiv Post (12 April 2012) –í –ê—Ö–º–µ—Ç–æ–≤–∞ –∫–∏—è–Ω–∞–º —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏: –í–∏–±–∞—á—Ç–µ, –º–∏ –¥–≤—ñ—á—ñ –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–∞–≤—ñ, UNIAN (12 April 2012) –ê—Ö–º–µ—Ç–æ–≤:—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∞—Å—è –ø–æ–º–∏–ª–∫–∞, –º–∏ –≤—Å–µ –≤–∏–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–º–æ, UNIAN (12 April 2012) Attractions Plan of the Andriyivskyy Descent with architectural monuments labelled based on their protection status. The Andriyivskyi Descent contains numerous historic attractions and museums. The 18th century baroque Saint Andrew's Church; the late 19th century Mikhail Bulgakov's house-museum; the 20th century Castle of Richard the Lionheart; the Museum of One Street, chronicling the Andriyivskyy Descent's history; and numerous other monuments attract tourists and Kyivans alike to the area. =Saint Andrew's Church= Another attraction of the Andriyivskyy Descent is the baroque Saint Andrew's Church. It is located atop a hill overlooking the Podil neighborhood from the Andriyivskyy Descent. The idea to construct the Saint Andrew's Church came from the Russian Tsaress Elizabeth Petrovna. When she visited Kyiv in 1747‚Äì1754, she laid the foundation brick of the church with her own hand, after which the church was constructed, to a design by the imperial architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Saint Andrew's Church with its side illuminated by the sun in the evening. As the Tsaress planned to take personal care of the church, the church has no parish, and there is no belltower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kyiv court took no interest maintaining in the church, last consecrated in 1767. Later, there were not enough funds to maintain the church, which left the maintaining of the church to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov. In 1963, Rastrelli's original plans for the building were found in Vienna, Austria. This made it possible to reconstruct the original images on the building. The plan of restoration was carried out in the 1970s, overlooked by the main architect-restorer, V. Korneyeva. Since 1968, the church has been opened as a museum to tourists and visitors. The church is now owned by the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. =Castle of Richard the Lionheart= The \\"Castle of Richard the Lionheart\\" house was built from 1902‚Äì1904. It was originally supposed to be called Orlov House in reference to its constructor Dmitry Orlov. But because its owner failed to clear the house construction with the city's authorities, a major scandal arose. Viktor Nekrasov named the building \\"The Castle of Richard the Lionheart\\", after the 12th century English king in his book. It has been established that the modernized Gothic fronts were practically copied from a published design for a Saint Petersburg building by the architect R. Marfeld. But the stunning relief of Andriyivskyy Descent softened the effect of this plagiarism. The cellar of the building contained a barber's shop, a grocery store and a butcher shop. The remaining premises were used as apartments for rent. When Dimitri Orlov died in 1911 while building a railroad in the Russian Far East, his widow, left with five children, had to sell off the house to pay her family's debts. In 1983, renovation works were started on the building to convert it into a hotel. Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, various reconstruction works have been largely unsuccessful. As of 2009, the Castle of Richard the Lionheart still stands empty and fenced off in renovation. Writer Mikhail Bulgakov's house-museum. =Mikhail Bulgakov's house= Mikhail Bulgakov, a famous Kyiv- born Russian writer, and his family lived on the street at two different houses in the early-20th century. In Bulgakov's novel The White Guard the author vividly describes the street and house (he calls it Aleksey Descent - \\"Alekseevskiy Spusk\\") in the turbulent times of the 1917 Russian Revolution. The address, at No.13 Andriyivskyy Descent is still commonly called the Bulgakov House and displays a plaque with the address the writer used in his book (No.13 Alekseevsky Spusk) (see image). Popular writer's statue is also installed near museum. A museum was opened inside the preserved building to mark the 100th birthday of Mikhail Bulgakov on May 15, 1991. The upper floor of the museum houses an exhibition of various Bulgakov objects, and the lower floor contains thematic exhibitions. The house, built in 1888 and designed by architect N. Gardenin, was thoroughly renovated before the opening of the museum. A memorial plaque with Bulgakov's portrait is now hanging on the front of the building. =One Street Museum= The One Street Museum is another main attraction of the Andriyivskyy Descent, which houses many of the historic items of the descent, containing more than 6,500 exhibits. They include information about the Saint Andrew's Church, the castle of Richard Lionheart, and the many other buildings of the Descent. Also, the museum has a unique collection of various works by Ukrainian philologist P. Zhitetsky, Arabist and professor of the Kyiv University T. Kezma, journalist and public figure A.Savenko, Ukrainian writer G.Tyutyunnyk, which have lived in the house No. 34 in the different periods of the twentieth century. Another important part of the collection in the museum is the memorabilia of professors of Kyiv Theological Academy A. Bulgakov, S. Golubev, P. Kudryavtsev, F. Titov, A.Glagolev, famed doctors Th. Janovsky and D. Popov, and other prominent local figures. The museum also has a large collection of antique books. Book relics of the exposition include a famous Trebnik of the Metropolitan of Kyiv Petro Mohyla, rare editions of works written by professors and graduates of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, unique books written by the Ukrainian Walter Scott, M.Grabovsky, the Defender of Orthodoxy, A.Muravyov, and the works of Mikhail Bulgakov published in his lifetime. =Lithuanian castle= Placard that informs about the existence of a castle of the 14th century and it is a joint Ukrainian-Lithuanian heritage The castle was built by Vladimir Olgerdovich, a progenitor of the Olelkovich family, in 1362. After being partially destroyed in 1648, in 1658 it was rebuilt as the Old Kyiv Fortress by the Russian city garrison. =Monuments= A 19th-century photograph of the descent, showing the St. Andrew's Church and the now destroyed Church of the Tithes in the background. The Andriyivskyy Descent also has a number of monuments. One of them is the monument to Yaroslav the Wise, the Grand Prince of Novgorod and Kyiv, which depicts him holding a model of the Saint Sophia Cathedral. Another is the monument to Pronya Prokopovna and Svirid Golohvastov, which was unveiled in 1989, depicting two characters, Pronya Prokopovna and Svirid Golohvastov, from the play Chasing Two Rabbits, which was written by Mykhailo Starytskyi. Another main monument on the street is dedicated to the famous Ukrainian poet and artist Taras Shevchenko, located to the right of the monument to Yaroslav the Wise. The Shevchenko monument is the first monument to Shevchenko in Ukraine and was originally unveiled in Romny on 27 October 1918. 100 years ago the first monument to Taras Shevchenko was built for the Hetmanate, Radio Svoboda (14 October 2018) Most recently, in 2007, a monument to Mikhail Bulgakov was opened on the Andriyivskyy Descent, the first dedicated to the writer in the former Soviet Union. Legends During its long history, the Andriyivskyy Descent has a couple of legends surround it. One legend states that when Andrew the Apostle visited the uninhabited mountains in the mid-stream of the Dnieper River (today's Andriyvskyy Descent area), he put up a cross atop of the hill where the descent starts and prophesied a foundation of a great Christian city. Since that time, wooden churches sprang up around in the vicinity, completing his prophecy. According to another legend, there was once a sea where the Dnieper River now flows. When Saint Andrew came to Kyiv and erected a cross on the place where the Saint Andrew's Church now stands, the sea went away. The only part that remained of the sea is under the mountain on which Kyiv sits today. When the church was built there in the 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again and flood the left bank of Kyiv.

Minot is roughly 40 miles north of Lake Sakakawea. Controversy The North Dakota government has stated that the project has received final approval, however the International Joint Commission has not approved any measure related to NAWS. The Canadian Government has taken issue with the program, as it moves water from the Missouri River basin, which flows south into the United States, to the Souris River basin, which flows north into Canada, possibly introducing foreign microbes into the water supply. Under the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909, any such interbasin transfers must be approved by the International Joint Commission. Funding The other main issue with the NAWS project is funding; federal, state, and local dollars have been pledged to the project, but in summer 2003, federal funds for the project were almost cut, jeopardizing construction. In 1998, voters in Minot decided to levy a 1% sales tax to go towards the construction of NAWS, but it is not enough to complete the program without federal funding. Further compounding the situation was an illegal diversion of funds from the NAWS tax fund into the city's MAGIC Fund. After a lawsuit was filed against the city, it was ordered to return the misappropriated funds to the NAWS fund, and did so by adding a special assessment on city water bills to raise the funds. Construction Despite the lack of international approval, a federal judge has allowed non-treatment portions of the project to proceed. As of 2007, less than a mile of the 36\\" pipeline is left to go in the ground between Minot and Lake Sakakawea, generally paralleling Highway 83. If the environmental statement is finished in spring 2008, intake and treatment facilities could be built over the next two years, and water could be piped to Minot in 2010.

The angels' roles are to assess the progress of humans giving them positive and negative scores based on their everyday actions. The angels, who have deemed that the Earthian are becoming far too destructive, decide that if the Earthian reach 10,000 negative marks instead of positive, then their world will be destroyed. While there are many sets of positive/negative partner teams that have descended to the Earth to carry out their investigations, the story focuses on a single pair that, due to the carelessness (or perhaps over-caring nature) of one, causes both to end up in trying circumstances multiple times throughout their stay on Earth... There are four OVAs total, three of which continue the same plot, and another that delves into a separate side story. All of them coincide with the original manga.  Story  For thousands of years angels have observed the behavior of humans from their homeland Eden. They are disgusted with humans for how they treat their planet and how they treat each other. It is decided that the humans should be wiped out. However, to give the humans a chance, Eden sends down many pairs of angels to observe the humans. One is a plus checker, who seeks the good in humans; the other is a minus checker, who seeks the bad in humans. If more good is seen in humans, they will be spared. But if 10,000 minus checks are made against them, then they will be destroyed. Along with humans, angels fear and despise Lucifers, also known as fallen angels. An angel is typically born with light hair and white wings, but if an angel acts against Eden too many times, then their hair and wings will turn black, known as the Black Cancer, and they die. To encourage that angels stay away from both humans and Lucifers, it's decreed that if an angel exposes their wings to three humans or if they meet too many Lucifers, they shall also become one as well. Chihaya is an orphaned angel of Eden. He was born with black hair and black wings, resembling a Lucifer. Because of this, he was shunned for most of his life, finding acceptance only in the residents at the orphanage and his adopted father Michael. He becomes a plus checker to see Earth and because of his love for humanity. Over time, he continuously interacts with Lucifers and feels a kinship towards them because of their hair and wings. He is paired with Kagetsuya, a handsome and popular white-winged angel who hates mankind and holds hostility for Lucifers. Due to this prejudice, Kagetsuya is extremely hostile towards Chihaya at first, constantly belittling him because of his feelings and appearance. Despite all this, Kagetsuya often finds himself carried away with Chihaya's ideals and constantly aiding him, though it's against his position. Things grow even more complicated for the pair when they fall in love with each other. Homosexuality is forbidden in Eden, but that doesn't stop their feelings for one another. Along the way, many secrets are discovered within Eden itself and the angels and the pair, especially Kagetsuya, must decide which side they will choose.  Characters = Main characters = Chihaya in his human form . :A beautiful male angel with short black hair. When he transforms he has long black hair and black wings. In Eden, where angels are generally fair-haired with white wings, Chihaya's naturally dark features make him an outcast. Despite his mutation, he is light-hearted and happy, and he cares deeply for the Earthian, unlike most other angels. This rare quality allows him to see beyond the Earthians' violence and destruction to the core of their hearts, which he believes are pure and kind, despite any other shortcomings. He is a positive checker, though he tends to let his emotions get in the way of his work. His special power is the ability to generate storms. Chihaya is the lover of Kagetsuya. Kagetsuya in the human form . :Chihaya's partner, a negative checker. He is a typical looking angel, with blond hair and white wings, and is from a wealthy family. Like most other angels, he also bears a strong resentment towards the Earthians, who he believes are irresponsible and selfish. He is more mature and focused than Chihaya, and often ends up having to go to the aid of his partner. His specialty lies in bird calling and the healing arts. Kagetsuya is the lover of Chihaya. = Episodes 1,3 & 4 = Dr. Ashino (Professor Ashiya). :The mad doctor who created the biohumanoids, Taki and Takako. He seems to love Taki more than anything else in the world, and his madness reaches its peak when his beloved creation defies him. Later, inspired by Chihaya, Ashino creates a third android, this one a black angel. . :An android made specially by the doctor to possess inhuman strength and endurance. Fed up with his life as a captive toy, Taki takes Takako and flees the laboratory, much to the dismay of his creator. He cares for Ashino, but he also does not want to be treated like a lifeless thing with no feelings. Takako. :Gynoid. Like Taki, she is an artificial. When the two of them get separated, she runs into Chihaya, who helps her flee from guards sent by Dr. Ashino to take her back to the lab. She is very concerned about Taki's well-being, for she does not know what had become of him after their escape, but apparently, Chihaya has some idea as to where he is... Messiah. :The black-winged angelic android created for one purpose only: to destroy the Earth and all the miserable people who went about their lives in spite of Dr. Ashino's suffering. Incidentally, before his memory chip can be properly finished, he makes contact with Chihaya, who shows him his identical black wings. Messiah becomes confused, but decides that what he truly wants is to protect Chihaya, at all costs... = Episode 2 = . :A female minus checker from Eden who openly flaunts her love for Kagetsuya and her scorn for the Earthian. She constantly makes it known to everyone that she would rather be Kagetsuya's partner, but not so much that she would convert to a plus checker. She gets worked up easily and is deeply envious of Chihaya. . :A male angel that slightly resembles Kagetsuya. Unlike the latter, though, he is a positive checker for the Earthian and believes that they should be given a chance. He is Aya's partner. His temperament is somewhat more relaxed than hers, and so he tries to keep her in check whenever possible. . :A former leader of the plus-checkers of Eden that contracted the Black Cancer. He later descended to Earth where Chihaya and Kagetsuya found him before he died. He was very close to Chihaya and the black-angel took the loss very badly. Sapphire (Cliff Grey). :Another angel who contracted the Black Cancer who was living in England with the woman he loved, Blair. Chihaya sought him out when he was battling with his doubts about his own wing and hair color. He later died from a gun wound. Blair (or Blare). :The Earthian that Sapphire fell in love with.  Plot =The Beginning of the End (OVA 1) Fallen Angel (OVA 2) = Of the four OVAs in the series, Fallen Angel is the only one that does not relate to the events of the first. Chihaya and Kagetsuya are staying in France for their current assignment, and lately Chihaya has been having some disturbing nightmares. As Kagetsuya tries to console his partner over breakfast, Aya and Miyagi show up on vacation, and decide to stay in France for a short while. Chihaya and Kagetsuya's mission is to locate the exiled angel named Sapphire, who has been hiding on Earth ever since his wings became black with cancer. Chihaya discovers Sapphire's whereabouts, and, learning about the former High Angel's predicament with some shady dealings, he lets himself become involved, much to the dismay of Kagetsuya, who knows that every time something bad goes down with the Earthian, it is always Chihaya who suffers. The partners struggle to help Sapphire while keeping everything a secret from their guests, but Chihaya's exceedingly strange behavior has not been lost on Aya, and she begins to make some deductions of her own. Both she and Miyagi are well aware of the fact that Sapphire's disappearance has not been taken lightly back in Eden, and as it is, any fallen angels are considered to be a huge disgrace. In the midst of all this, Chihaya is also hiding a secret of his own; one that has to do with the frightening dreams he has been having. His fears are eating away at his heart, and he worries that what happened to Sapphire might be the same thing that caused the abnormal color in his wings and hair. = Angelic Destroyer (OVA 3) = Picking up where the 1st OVA left off, Chihaya and Kagetsuya are trying to infiltrate Dr. Ashino's lab in order to rescue two black angel children who are being held for interrogation by the mad doctor. The pair split up to search for the hostages, and while wandering through the corridors, Chihaya discovers, locked away in a side room, a black-winged angel like himself, attached to wires extending from the walls. The angel's name is Messiah, and Chihaya, desperate to get the dormant figure's attention, exposes his wings at the window of the room. Messiah's memory chip, still in the process of being encrypted, takes in the image of Chihaya's transformation and fills Messiah's mind with strange emotions. He is compelled to approach the angel on the other side of the glass window, but cannot get out of the locked room. An alarm begins to sound, and Chihaya and Kagetsuya meet up again, Kagetsuya carrying the two children. They are forced to evacuate the lab immediately, as it is about to explode. Elvira, the mother of the children, pulls up in her car and help them get away. Chihaya is deeply troubled that he was unable to save the black-winged angel. One morning, while watching the news, Chihaya discovers that Doctor Ashino has arrived in the city accompanied by a strange man in a trenchcoat. Chihaya immediately recognizes the man as Messiah. Ashino has been having dealings with the military, and was commissioned into creating the ultimate weapon of destruction: Messiah. However, he is not in it just for the money. Troubled by the fact that Taki abandoned him, Ashino is plotting a revenge against the entire world, who stood by despite his suffering. = Final Battle (OVA 4) = Chihaya is reluctant to accept Messiah's disappearance, and no matter how Kagetsuya tries to comfort him, he can only ever think of the android whose wings were like his. Messiah, in the meanwhile, is making his living carrying out errands for a club of drug dealers. He feels accepted by these people, who are appreciative of his physical strength, but longs to find Chihaya again. Using his connection to the world's computer database, Messiah searches for his friend. Chihaya, also online, discovers Messiah's call, and rushes to meet him in the sky. However, Ashino has also been tracking Messiah, and he sends in men to capture the runaway android. Ultimately, Messiah needs to choose between staying with Chihaya and learning more about the emotions that confuse him, or give up his freedom in exchange for the assurance of Chihaya's safety, and become the weapon of destruction he was intended to be.  Presence of Sh≈çnen-ai (in the OVA)  Because the OVA focused only on two stories out of a manga that contained many others, some things were cut from the plot line. As a result, viewers without prior knowledge of the manga may wonder about the events in the OVAs. Earthian is a sh≈çnen-ai title, and of all the OVAs, but the only time this theme is referenced is for a brief time in the third episode. There is no mention of the manga forbidding of homosexuality in Eden, and as such some degree of depth of conflict is missing for characters who show signs of interest in those of the same gender. This was likely done because the depth of detail that would have to be explained would not be possible for an OVA series. Reception The fourth OVA was reviewed by Anime News Network, which called Earthian \\"not that good, plot-wise\\".Earthian - Final Battle - Review - Anime News Network Helen McCarthy in 500 Essential Anime Movies says that manga was \\"a meditation of mortality, love and the responsibly we have to create our own Eden\\", while in OVA Kagetsuya and Chihaya \\"get the most of the screen time\\" and the OVA \\"crams in so much that there's little time to explain or develop even the remaining cast\\".

Biography  Shirek was born in Jefferson, Arkansas and grew up on a farm, the granddaughter of slaves. She moved to Berkeley in the 1940s and immediately gained a reputation for her dedication to civil rights issues. She married Brownlee Shirek and worked as office manager for the Co-op Credit Union. She was active in the anti-war movement, was a staunch union supporter, founded two Berkeley senior centers, championed HIV/AIDS awareness, and helped organize the Free Mandela movement. She was one of the first elected officials in the United States to advocate for a needle exchange program. After being forced to retire from her job as director of a Berkeley senior center because of her age, Shirek ran for city council at the age of 73. She served 8 consecutive terms from 1984 to 2004. At the end of her tenure, aged 92, she was one of the oldest elected officials in the State of California. In 2005, Berkeley sought to name the Berkeley main post office after Shirek, but the attempt was defeated in Congress due to Republican opposition led by Iowa Congressman Steve King, who took issue with her connection to Oakland's Niebyl-Proctor Marxist Library and her support for the release of Mumia Abu- Jamal. In 2007, the Berkeley City Council renamed City Hall in her honor. A San Francisco Chronicle article referred to Shirek as \\"the godmother of East Bay progressive politics.\\" References Category:1911 births Category:2013 deaths Category:American centenarians Category:California city council members Category:Politicians from Jefferson County, Arkansas Category:Politicians from Berkeley, California Category:Women in California politics Category:Women city councillors in the United States Category:Women centenarians ","title":"Maudelle Shirek"},{"id":"3953213","title":"Zamboanga International Airport"},{"id":"3953226","text":"Manori beach during early morning. Another view of Manori beach during early morning. Manori is a village located on Dharavi Bet in northern Mumbai, India. It is known for its beach and the Manori Creek. Transportation * Manori can be reached by road via Bhayander, Dahisar Check naka. * The sea route, however, is relatively shorter. Manori is a 15-minute ferry ride away from Marve Beach in Malad. * The closest railway station is Malad. Local population Manori is dominated by the local fishing & farming community. Fishing and farming are the major occupations among the locals. The village is divided into 3 sections i.e. Koliwada, Bhandarwada and Panchghar. Koliwada being the most populated and congested compared to other sections. The largest bungalow in the village, \\"Green Villa\\", belongs to Stephen & Francis Aloo Ferreira now and is also known as \\"Motha Ghar\\" & the largest family in the village is \\"Sodawala Family\\". Tourism Manori is a very popular weekend destination among the people of Mumbai. The beach, roads, and overall culture are similar to Goa, providing a mini-Goa experience within the city of Mumbai. Apart from beachside shacks, there are two resorts in Manori designed like Spanish villas. Manori has numerous hotels and cottages, as many picnickers visit daily; the village beaches and resorts are crowded. It is a popular destination for city-dwellers escaping the stressful city environment. There are food stands that serve Indo-Chinese and East Indian food and seafood. Some of the popular dishes are Pork vindaloo and sorpotel, chicken raan, stuffed pomfret, dry Bombay duck chutney, rotis, prawns chilly fry, and fried bombay duck. Delicious beef dishes can also be found without much effort. Manori is also very popular among cyclists of Mumbai who go to Manori and its surrounding islands like Gorai, Uttan, etc. Groups usually go for ghost hunting in Kinnys, Ocean hills and Domnica. Also for cycling on weekends due to is pleasant climate, beautiful surroundings and minimum traffic. Hotels in Manori 1)Domonica Beach Resort http://www.domonicasresort.com/ 2)Manoribel Resort http://www.manoribel.com/ Places of religious attraction There is A Mazaar of Baba Kader Shah Vali located in manori which is very popular among Muslims and Hindus both.Foreligious/spiritual visitor, the Global Vipassana Pagoda, the world's largest structure containing the bone relics of the Buddha , offers a scenic view. There are two ashrams of the spiritual masters of Nath Sampradaya - Swami Gagangiri Maharaj and his disciple Swami Gagananand Maharaj. There is a Shiva temple (Samudreshwar) located at the jetty of Manori. Future plans With new MMRDA plans for a tourism zone for Manori, Culvem, Gorai and Uttan, it is likely that these areas are going to be converted into picnic and recreation destinations. Out of all the villages in the Gorai Manori Uttan Development Plan, most of the tourism zone is allotted to Manori Village. Some agricultural lands will be converted into a \\"green zone\\" where farm houses, bungalows, swimming pools, etc. may be constructed. Since the MMRDA drafts were released, the local real estate is in great demand. The value of properties is increasing and investors from Mumbai are buying plots.

For a long time, Eve of Destiny was a solo project of Ash, with not much real activity, but this changed in 2002, after guitarist K√∂zi of Malice Mizer fame joined and they started to tour outside Japan on a regular basis. The group has performed in Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, The Philippines, Slovakia, The Netherlands, Japan, France, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Poland. Members=Haruhiko Ash= Prior to Eve of Destiny, Haruhiko Ash founded the Japanese hard rock band The Zolge and the Tokyo club Eve the New Church, a place to promote gothic music and the Japanese underground music scene. Ash was a close friend of Lords of the New Church vocalist Stiv Bators and his wife Caroline. The Zolge was a quite well known band in Japan's underground music scene in the 1980s and 1990s. Upon playing some concerts abroad he made several acquaintances with bands and people. These include The Damned, Patricia Morrison, Hanoi Rocks, The Cramps, Ramones, Johnny Thunders, Switchblade Symphony and others. The Zolge disbanded in 1993, but Haruhiko Ash stayed active in various fields such as writing and fashion modeling in both Paris and Tokyo. Later, in 1998, the song \\"Desperado\\" was released in the Black Bible compilation from US label Cleopatra Records. This was Eve of Destiny's first recorded song. =K√∂zi= K√∂zi is the former guitarist of the popular Japanese visual kei band Malice Mizer. After they went on hiatus at the end of 2001, K√∂zi joined Haruhiko Ash, whom he knew from times before Malice Mizer, and together they reformed the Eve of Destiny project. Later, K√∂zi started a solo career, releasing several singles and albums.  History  Shortly after the release of the Black Bible compilation, Eve of Destiny was invited to play at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig, Germany in 1999, where Haruhiko appeared together with several guest musicians. After this, years of silence followed. However around the time Malice Mizer disbanded Eve of Destiny was invited again, so in 2002 Haruhiko returned, now together with K√∂zi (before this they only played two gigs at the Philippines). The concert was quite a success and they were also invited to New Zealand and Switzerland later that year. In 2003 they started to tour Europe regularly and played at several countries for then on, both at festivals and clubs. The band played its first concert in Japan in February, 2004 and it was followed by two more next year, but Europe remained their main target. They had some tracks in compilation CDs, appeared in a few gothic magazines and were looking for a record company. They finally signed to the German Celtic Circle Production label, but unfortunately this turned out to be a bad choice. After postponing it for countless times the label finally released their debut mini-album called 'Nervous And Innocence' in 2005, but scandals followed, including the last-minute cancellation of a festival organized by the label and the CD was basically impossible to get. Soon afterwards even the label's website disappeared and the band decided to cancel their contract with them. Eve of Destiny played a few more gigs in Autumn, 2005, but after this even their website was not updated any more and it finally disappeared in 2006. K√∂zi continued his solo career, but there is no news about Haruhiko Ash or about any future activity for Eve of Destiny. Around September, 2007, a new website for the band and Haruhiko's company, Evil Boy Productions showed up, hinting at some kind of activity, but just a few months later, it disappeared without a trace.

It uses the shadows and light direction as reference points. It is used mostly to depict the surface of sculptures, to give an idea of how it would look in 3-dimensions. The techniques depend on very specific conditions, especially light direction. The process When light bounces off an object, it reflects with location- specific brightness that depends on the shape of the object and the position of the lightning source. This reflection map can be used to create a bump map of a surface, which uses grayscale levels to depict the height of a point on a surface. Knowing the direction and angle of the light source, one can calculate the approximate height that a point has. However, the light direction and angle is usually unknown, which leads to poor quality images, or having to create multiple bump maps, each time trying different settings. Usage * Some artists use photoclinometry to digitize a 3-dimensional representation of a sculpture. * Geologists and those that study planetary science use it to get an idea of how the surface of a planet looks like, and generate topographic maps and digital elevation models (see photometric stereo). Planetary applications began with investigations of lunar topography as early as 1951 and has since been applied to the Martian surface. * Glaciologists have used photoclinometry to characterize the surfaces of Antarctica and Greenland. Repeat photoclinometry is a method of building surfaces from a series of satellite image to investigate changes in ice sheet topography over time. * Photoclinometry has been used to measure volcanic plume top topography on Earth. Problems Light direction is very important to the quality of a photoclinometric image. Light that comes from directly over the surface (behind the camera) makes it hard to distinguish the shadows. Multiple light sources are also a problem, since they destroy important shadows required for the algorithms to work properly. In order to solve these problems, new missions to other planets plan to use a process similar to stereoscopy in order to get a more accurate depiction of the surface on another planet. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is one of the mission that attempts to do this. This process uses two images of one location taken from two separate lens on a camera, much in the same way humans do with their eyes. By using two images, they can get a 3-dimensional perspective of objects on the surface like we do.

This model shows the events that ultimately lead small populations to become increasingly more vulnerable as they spiral toward extinction. Developed by M. E. Gilpin and M. E. Soul√© in 1986, there are currently four classes of extinction vortices. The first two (R and D) deal with environmental factors that have an effect on the ecosystem or community level, such as disturbance, pollution, habitat loss etc. Whereas the second two (F and A) deal with genetic factors such as inbreeding depression and outbreeding depression, genetic drift etc. Types of vortices *R Vortex: The R vortex is initiated when there is a disturbance which facilitates a lowering of population size (N) and a corresponding increase in variability (Var(r)). This event can make populations vulnerable to additional disturbances which will lead to further decreases in population size (N) and further increases in variability (Var(r)). A prime example of this would be the disruption of sex ratios in a population away from the species optimum. *D Vortex: The D vortex is initiated when population size (N) decreases and variability (Var(r)) increases such that the spatial distribution (D) of the population is increased and the population becomes \\"patchy\\" or fragmented. Within these fragments, local extinction rates increase which, through positive feedback, further increases D. *F Vortex: The F vortex is initiated by a decrease in population size (N) which leads to a decrease in heterozygosity, and therefore a decrease in genetic diversity. Decreased population size makes the effects of genetic drift more prominent, resulting in increased risk of inbreeding depression and an increase in population genetic load, which over time will result in extinction. *A Vortex: The A vortex is a result of an increase in the impact of genetic drift on the population, due to the population's decreased size. This corresponds with a decrease in genetic variance which leads to a decrease in \\"population adaptive potential\\", and eventual extinction. This vortex can result from biological invasion, resulting in large scale hybridization and outbreeding depression. Extinction Vortex Factors Environmental factors: Many of the environmental events that contribute to an extinction vortex do so through reduction in population size. These events can include rapid loss of population size due to disease, natural disasters, and climate change. Habitat loss and/or habitat degradation can also kick start an extinction vortex. Other factors include events that occur more gradually, such over-harvesting (hunting, fishing, etc.), or excessive predation. Genetic factors:Frankham et al. (2017) \\"Genetic Management of Fragmented Animal and Plant Populations\\". Chapter 3, Inbreeding reduces reproductive fitness. Oxford University Press: United Kingdom Populations that succumb to an extinction vortex experience strong genetic factors that cause already small populations to decrease in size over time. All populations experience genetic drift, a random process that causes changes in the population genetic structure over time. Small populations are particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in population genetic structure due to the random nature gamete sampling. When a population is small, any change in alleles can disproportionately impact the population. Thus, genetic drift leads small populations to lose genetic diversity. Additionally, when populations become small, inbreeding increases because individuals are more likely to mate with others with a genome that contains many of the same alleles. Inbreeding can lead to inbreeding depression within the population, and this can cause fewer offspring, more birth defects, more individuals prone to disease, decreased survival and reproduction (fitness), and decreased genetic diversity within the population. With a decrease in genetic diversity comes even greater likelihood of inbreeding and inbreeding depression. Another genetic factor that can lead small populations toward the spiral of extinction is limited gene flow. For example, if a population becomes isolated due to habitat fragmentation, migration rates decrease or become non-existent, causing the population to lose genetic diversity over time and increasing inbreeding. Migration is important because new individuals from outside of the population will almost certainly add new genetic variation, which can increase overall fitness within the population. One example of the role of genetics in extinction occurs in the case of fragmented metapopulations of southern dunlins (Calidris alpine schinzii) in SW Sweden. These endangered shorebirds experienced inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity at two molecular markers examined, and this limited survival and reproduction throughout the population by increasing inbreeding. When parent dunlins with more similar genetics mated, their offspring had lower likelihood of hatching, and if they did manage to hatch, they were more likely to die soon after hatching.Blomqvist, D., Pauliny, A., Larsson, M., Flodin, L. \\"Trapped in the extinction vortex? Strong genetic effects in a declining vertebrate population\\". (2009) BMC Evolutionary Biology 10:33 } Demographic factors: Demographic factors that are involved in extinction vortices include reduced fecundity, changes in dispersal patterns, and decreased population density.

The two right columns are Isthmian glyphs. The left column gives a Mesoamerican Long Count calendar date of 8.5.16.9.9, or 156 CE. The Isthmian script is a very early Mesoamerican writing system in use in the area of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec from perhaps 500 BCE to 500 CE, although there is disagreement on these dates. It is also called the La Mojarra script and the Epi-Olmec script ('post-Olmec script'). Isthmian script is structurally similar to the Maya script, and like Maya uses one set of characters to represent logograms (or word units) and a second set to represent syllables.Lo.

This sherd has been assigned the oldest date of any Isthmian script artifact: 450-300 BCE.P√©rez de Lara and Justeson. Decipherment In a 1993 paper, John Justeson and Terrence Kaufman proposed a partial decipherment of the Isthmian text found on the La Mojarra Stela, claiming that the language represented was a member of the Zoquean language family.Justeson and Kaufman (1993). In 1997, the same two epigraphers published a second paper on Epi-Olmec writing, in which they further claimed that a newly discovered text-section from the stela had yielded readily to the decipherment-system that they had established earlier for the longer section of text.Justeson and Kaufman (1997). This led to a Guggenheim Fellowship for their work, in 2003. The following year, however, their interpretation of the La Mojarra text was disputed by Stephen D. Houston and Michael D. Coe, who had tried unsuccessfully to apply the Justeson-Kaufman decipherment-system to the Isthmian text on the back of the hitherto unknown Teotihuacan-style mask (which is of unknown provenance and is now in a private collection).Brigham Young University press-release. Despite the lack of provenance, Houston \\"is confident it [the mask text] was written sometime between A.D. 300 and 500\\" which would place it 150 to 250 years later than the La Mojarra stela.

Hence, this stands in contrast to releasing a signaling molecule by diffusion into extracellular space, the use of long- range conduits like membrane nanotubes and cytonemes (akin to 'bridges') or the use of extracellular vesicles like exosomes or microvesicles (akin to 'boats'). There are three types of juxtacrine signaling: # A membrane ligand (protein, oligosaccharide, lipid) and a membrane protein of two adjacent cells interact. # A communicating junction links the intracellular compartments of two adjacent cells, allowing transit of relatively small molecules. # An extracellular matrix glycoprotein and a membrane protein interact. Additionally, in unicellular organisms such as bacteria, juxtacrine signaling refers to interactions by membrane contact. Juxtacrine signaling has been observed for some growth factors, cytokine and chemokine cellular signals, playing an important role in the immune response. It has a critical role in development, particularly of cardiac and neural function. Other types of cell signaling include paracrine signalling and autocrine signalling. The term \\"juxtacrine\\" was originally introduced by Anklesaria et al. (1990) to describe a possible way of signal transduction between TGF alpha and EGFR. Cell‚Äìcell signaling In this type of signaling, a cell places a specific ligand on the surface of its membrane, and subsequently another cell can bind it with an appropriate cell surface receptor or cell adhesion molecule. An important example is the Notch signaling pathway, notably involved in neural development. Communicating junctions Two adjacent cells can construct communicating conduits between their intracellular compartments: gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmas in plants. Gap junctions are made of connexins in vertebrates and innexins in invertebrates. Electrical synapses are electrically conductive gap junctions between neurons. Gap junctions are critical for cardiac myocytes, mice and humans deficient in a particular gap junction protein have severe heart development defects.  Cell‚Äìextracellular matrix signaling  The extracellular matrix is composed of glycoproteins (proteins and mucopolysaccharides (glycosaminoglycan)) produced by the organism's cells. They are secreted not only to build a supportive structure but also to provide critical information on the immediate environment to nearby cells. Indeed, the cells can themselves interact by contact with extracellular matrix molecules and as such, this can be considered an indirect cell / cell communication. Cells use mainly the receptor integrin to interact with ECM proteins. This signaling can influence the cell cycle and cellular differentiation. In unicellular organisms In addition to releasing signaling molecules into their environment to initiate quorum sensing, bacteria can use contact-dependent signaling through different mechanisms, for such purpose as to inhibit their growth in harsh conditions.

Style Starting with 29 and Counting, written in the tone of one girlfriend talking to another, Tilsner's books often use personal experiences to illustrate her outlook on life, conveyed in a way that appears intended to strike the reader as funny, and slightly shocking, yet true. One of the typical gags in Planet Parenthood is a section on when to resume postpartum sex which devotes several paragraphs to the mother's psychological reentry to sexuality, body issues, and the ethical choices involved in risking bringing another baby into the family and our dangerous modern world. Thereafter, the section dealing with the man's feeling says, in its totality: \\"Dad's ready to go in about two weeks.\\" Attack of the Toddlers dismisses the notion that expectant parents should learn about the phases that their amazing offspring will go through, on the grounds that the child's development is more or less programmed by DNA. The book focuses instead on the sometimes involuntary metamorphosis the parents themselves will go through. \\"Parenthood is a state from which you never recover,\\" according to the book. \\"You won't regret it, but you're going to change. Big time.\\" Mommy Yoga uses difficult, often impossible, yoga poses as metaphors to describe the demands of motherhood. It is based in part on contributions solicited from women via an email list. The cover features a mother who, despite her contented smile, is in the pose of a beast of burden.

Katz, 546 U.S. 356 (2006), is a United States Supreme Court case holding that the Bankruptcy Clause of the Constitution abrogates state sovereign immunity. It is significant as the only case allowing Congress to use an Article I power to authorize individuals to sue states.  Background  In England, sovereign immunity referred to the concept that the king could not be sued without his consent. Beginning with Hans v. Louisiana (1890), a line of controversial Supreme Court cases had applied the concept of sovereign immunity to suits brought by private individuals against state governments. See The Eleventh Amendment. By the time Central Virginia Community College v. Katz came up for review, a majority of the justices on the Supreme Court had suggested Congress could never authorize individuals to sue a state pursuant to its Article I powers, including the Bankruptcy power. Seminole Tribe v. Florida. Wallace's Bookstores did business with Central Virginia Community College, an arm of the state. While it was insolvent, Wallace's Bookstores made certain preferential transfers of property to the state to satisfy debts. After Wallace's Bookstores filed for bankruptcy, Katz, the bankruptcy trustee, sued the state under to recover those transfers. The state raised sovereign immunity as a defense.  Oral arguments  Oral argument was held on October 31, 2005, with William E. Thro arguing for the petitioners and Kim Martin Lewis for the respondents. During oral arguments, a light bulb exploded above the bench, showering the front of the court with small shards of glass. Chief Justice John Roberts, who had been on the court for less than a month quipped that \\"it's a trick they play on new chief justices all the time,\\" prompting laughter, \\"we're even more in the dark now than before.\\"  Opinion of the Court  In an opinion by Justice Stevens, the Court rejected the state's claim of sovereign immunity.The Supreme Court, 2005 Term ‚Äî Leading Cases, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 125 (2006). The Court first noted that during the time the Articles of Confederation were in effect, states often did not recognize another state's discharge of a person's debt. This patchwork of bankruptcy laws made it difficult for people in debt to get out of debtors' prison. In light of this history, the Court interpreted Congress' power under the Bankruptcy Clause to make \\"uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies\\" to include the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity. The Court stated early bankruptcy legislation also supported its interpretation of the Bankruptcy Clause. It noted that in 1800, when concerns for state sovereign immunity ran fervent, Congress, with no recorded objection, gave federal courts power to release debtors from state prison through the writ of habeas corpus. In coming to its conclusion, the Court declined to follow dicta in Seminole Tribe v. Florida suggesting a contrary result. = Dissent = Justice Thomas, writing for himself and three other justices, argued the historical record indicated states did not give up their sovereign immunity under the Bankruptcy Clause. The dissenters would have followed the view that nothing in Article I abrogates state sovereign immunity.

It was chaired by Jim McClelland. Background In September 1950, the then UK Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, requested via a secure telegraph, to Australia's Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies, to conduct a series of atomic tests at the Monte Bello Islands off the coast of Western Australia. Over the next thirteen years, twelve major British nuclear tests would occur on Australian territory, along with thirty \\"minor\\" atomic trials testing sub-systems. The last Vixen B trial occurred in 1963 whereupon the United Kingdom moved its testing operations to the United States. The Royal Commission into nuclear tests arose out of a public outcry, led by media reports, over the increasing evidence (and statistical significance) of premature deaths of former Australian staff associated with the atomic tests and subsequent birth defects of their off-springs. Likewise, remote indigenous communities downwind of the tests had statistically significant higher rates of radiation related diseases not generally found among indigenous communities to the same level. In light of the increasing evidence and public lobbying by concerned groups, the Hawke Labor Government established a Royal Commission to investigate the British atomic tests in Australia. The Royal Commission into nuclear tests was told that 30 badly leaking drums of radio-active waste were dumped off the West Australian coast. The Commission was also told that acting Prime Minister Arthur Fadden had sent a message to the British PM asking \\"What the bloody hell is going on, the cloud is drifting over the mainland?\\".The Age, The West Australian 5/1/85 The Sunday Times 6/1/85 A CSIRO scientist is making use of the thin blanket of radioactive caesium-137 laid over Australia from atmospheric nuclear tests to measure soil erosion.The West Australian, The Age 7 January 1985 The McClelland Royal Commission was told that one hundred Aboriginal people walked barefoot over nuclear-contaminated ground because boots they had been given didn't fit.Daily News 5/2/85, The West Australian, The Age 6/2/85 The 1953 British nuclear test that allegedly caused 'black mist' phenomenon in South Australia should not have been fired and the fallout was about three times more than forecast, according to a scientist who was involved in the tests.The Age, 13/2/1985The West Australian, 13/2/1985 A house built less than 200 metres from an area mined for mineral sands 25 years ago is still contaminated from mineral-sands tailings which are dangerously radioactive.The West Australian, 8/4/1985 According to a special report on an investigation of residual radio-active contamination, about 100,000 dangerous metal fragments contaminated with plutonium still litter the Maralinga atomic test range ‚Äì 25 years after the atomic tests which caused them.The West Australian, 26/4/1985 A miner has told the McClelland Royal Commission on British nuclear weapons tests in Australia, that geiger counter readings of the fallout levels near Marble Bar were \\"off-the-scale\\".The West Australian, 6/8/1985The Age, 6/8/1985 Inquiry findings and conclusions The McClelland Royal Commission found that:pp.303-306 * then Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies approved the British nuclear tests without first receiving independent Australian scientific advice on the hazards to humans or the environment. * the Australia Federal Cabinet was kept in the dark by Menzies about key aspects of the nuclear tests. * the atomic test agreement by the British and Australian governments was done in retrospect after the first test had occurred. * Australia was forced to accept UK assurances on the safety and likely fallout lifespan hazards of the atomic tests, without an independent scientific assessment. * Australia's key representative to oversee the atomic tests on behalf of Australia, Sir Ernest Titterton, was in fact an ex-pat British person who withheld key information from the Australian Government. * the safeguards against radiation exposure for the nuclear veterans were totally inadequate, even by the best practice standards of the 1950s. * it is probable that the rate of cancers that occurred subsequent to the atomic tests in Australia would not have otherwise occurred were it not for the fallout from the tests. * the Vixen tests on plutonium should have not occurred knowing the half-life and radiation hazard of plutonium even with 1950s knowledge of the hazards. * failure to provide Australian air crews with protective equipment on over-flights or direct fly-throughs of the atomic mushroom clouds was clearly negligent. Controversy over findings and alleged bias The report's approach and conclusions apparently differed from the British Government's official history, based on official British records, by Lorna Arnold.Arnold, Lorna (1987). A Very Special Relationship: British Atomic Weapons Trials in Australia. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office. . This report emphasized the partnership between the two nations, and noted that the approach taken towards safety was to international standards of the time and had contrasted with the historic disregard of Australian authorities toward the welfare of indigenous people. Some observers have noted that both reports were framed in the politics of the time: Britain wished to minimize its responsibility, while the Australian government of Bob Hawke wished to implicate their political opponents alongside the British, and have suggested that the timeline of the inquiry was chosen so as not to implicate earlier Labor governments. However, the Australian Labor Party had not been in power federally from 1950 until 1972, clearly undermining that argument. Likewise the Arnold report was criticized for being authored by a former employee of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), and for the author having never visited the test sites nor interviewed Australian participants who worked on the atomic tests. The Royal Commission witness statements of recounting discussions between Australian RAAF and USAF B-29 flight crews clearly demonstrate that the tests were not at then international standards in terms of testing instruments nor health and safety precautions for radiation pp.53 . The Royal Commission heard ample evidence of British scientists being fully dressed in protective radiation suits that were not issued to Australian staff working in the same high-risk radiation zones.

It was hosted by Chris Rose. Each episode opened with Rose discussing an element of poker strategy with a professional poker player associated with the Full Tilt site, usually Howard Lederer. The discussion was illustrated with footage from one or more hands from Poker Superstars or another FSN-televised poker tournament. The point was further illustrated by the play of a mock hand by actors, once showing the play without following the tip and once following it. Tips ranged from such basic points of strategy as starting hand selection to more advanced plays like semi-bluffing and slowplaying. In another segment, Rose hosted a roundtable discussion among several pros like Annie Duke, Phil Hellmuth, Mike Matusow, Daniel Negreanu and others. Initially the pros expanded on the tip of the episode, relating personal experiences with the play and sometimes illustrated by another videotaped hand in which one or more of the pros was involved. The final segment returned to the pros and may have touched again on the tip of the episode or ranged to another unrelated topic.

He was born in Walsall, Staffordshire, England and arrived in South Africa as a designer for Brimble and Briggs Ltd. in 1928. He established a high profile as an artist, broadcaster and actor, also known for his success in business activities and as a designer of boats. His early painting style was impressionistic, and his work was referred to, along with that of Sydney Carter (q.v.), as \\"staid, stuffy and provincial\\" (Lewis, 1946:25). He was elected President of the South African Society of Artists (SASA) in 1945 after first joining in 1934. In 1949, he travelled in the USA, and his style changed in response to the growing orthodoxy of abstraction there. In the 1950s he began to experiment with non-figuration, but was unable to relinquish his attachment to figurative elements. A personal mysticism began to shape much of his thought and he became interested in the relationship of painting, poetry and music. This was well received by critics bored by the conservatism of SASA exhibitions in the 1940s. He was specially commended on the SASA Members' Exhibition of 1950 as follows: \\"Undoubtedly the best thing on the show is a smallish canvas 'Eileen Joyce plays Chopin', by Frank Spears. Here is a genuine attempt to interpret a musical theme in terms of paint; one feels the spirit of action in the moving chords placed in a flowing design\\" (P.H.W.: The Cape Times: 31.8.1950). Spears's handling of paint was thought by Berman to be analogous to that of Jean Welz (1900-1975): \\"His concepts are usually quiet and undramatic; still life and flower studies form a large part of his oeuvre. His palette is restrained, with distinctive use of ochres and warm pinkish tones, frequently accented by a characteristic note of Cerulean blue\\" (1983:434). Roses, from the SANG Permanent Collection, is typical of his later flower-pieces that were much admired. Spears retired in 1968 and in 1969 returned to England, but continued to exhibit in SA thereafter. The painting \\"Descent from the Cross\\" can be viewed to the left of the High Altar at St. George's Cathedral, Cape Town (Frank S. Spears is not to be confused with the Australian painter, Frank H. Spears, (1904‚Äì1987). Frank Hilton Spears was born in Mosman (Sydney) and died in Attadale (Perth). He was known for his beautiful oil landscapes and seascapes. His own Wikipedia entry is pending.)

Williams was named \\"Athlete of the Century\\" on the 100th anniversary of Athletics New Zealand, in 1987. Early life  Williams was born on 25 April 1929 in Dunedin. She grew up there and attended Otago Girls' High School. While at high school, Williams played several sports, making the top netball team and playing for Otago and the South Island. Williams also represented Otago, the South Island and New Zealand (1950, 1953‚Äì55) in basketball. Athletics career Williams joined the Otago Athletic Club in early 1947, mainly for social reasons. Two months later, she came to national attention when she won the shot put at the New Zealand athletics championships. She went on to win 21 national titles across 5 disciplines: shot put (1947‚Äì54), javelin (1950), discus (1951‚Äì54), long jump (1948‚Äì54) and the 80 m hurdles (1954). With 21 New Zealand titles, she is the joint second-most successful New Zealand female athlete at that level, with Beatrice Faumuina and Melissa Moon, behind Val Young (35 titles). Jim Bellwood, who had moved to Dunedin in late 1947 or early 1948, became her trainer. When Bellwood moved to Auckland in 1952 to teach at Avondale College, Williams followed, boarding with an aunt and uncle in Devonport. Controversially left out of the New Zealand team for the 1948 Olympic Games in London, Williams won the long jump title at the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland. Her winning leap of broke the national, Empire Games, and British Empire records. At the same competition, she also won the silver medal in the women's javelin, with a throw of . In 1951 Williams jumped at a meet in Melbourne, the third-best distance ever by a woman at that time, increased her New Zealand shot put record, and also became the New Zealand discus record holder. At the 1952 New Zealand championships, Williams became the first woman in history to jump over more than once, winning the long jump title with a distance of , but the distance was not recognised as a world record as it was wind-assisted. Also in 1952 she recorded a score of 4219 points in the pentathlon, setting a New Zealand record that stood for 10 years. Williams won the gold medal in the long jump at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki; her winning distance of 6.24 m was a new Olympic record and 1 cm short of Fanny Blankers-Koen's world record set in 1943. Also at Helsinki, Williams finished in sixth place in the shot put and 10th in the discus throw. In February 1954, Williams broke the women's long jump world record at Gisborne, New Zealand, with a leap of 6.28 metres. Later that year she travelled to Vancouver for the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, winning gold medals in the long jump, discus, and shot put, all with Empire Games record performances, and finishing sixth in the 80 m hurdles. She announced her retirement from athletic competition in November 1954. At the time she ranked number one in world track and field history in the long jump, fifth in the pentathlon, 12th in the discus throw and 19th in the shot put.  Personal life  Williams married Buddy Corlett, a member of the national basketball team, in Auckland on 11 December 1954. The couple had four children, including national basketball representative Neville Corlett; Auckland provincial rugby union player Peter Corlett, and Karen Corlett, who represented New Zealand in rhythmic gymnastics at the 1977 world championships. Williams' younger brother, Roy Williams, won the decathlon at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. Buddy Corlett died on 9 May 2015.

It was hosted by boxing commentator Max Kellerman and co-hosted by handicapper Wayne Allyn Root, who gave color commentary and his odds-on favorites for each game. The tournament director was Matt Savage, who has also directed tournaments at the World Series of Poker.  Format  Unlike other gambling series on television, King of Vegas includes competition in eight different casino games; four per week, all starting with Blackjack and ending a final game of Texas Hold 'Em. All games are played with players getting a fresh set of $10,000 in chips (the format would later change a bit, but the $10,000 chip gain remained constant until the final episode). All games are played with limited hands/rounds to fit with the show's fast pace and hour-long time slot. All games have no limits on betting. The show features twelve players, gathered by the producers/creators of the show. Six of the players are gambling pros of varied games and ages. The other six are unknowns in gambling, never having broken into the pro circuit of any game, some of which possibly involved in games on a small level (such as a card dealer). Each week, one player is eliminated, leaving the show with no prize whatsoever. The winner of the tournament takes home $1,000,000 and is crowned King of Vegas. To start, the players are randomly divided into two groups. One half plays one game (called a \\"Round\\"), with a certain number of players with high scores going to the \\"Sitting Pretty\\" couch, meaning they are safe from elimination for that week. The other half then play a different casino game with a certain number of players again \\"Sitting Pretty.\\" A third game is then played with the players who still haven't qualified. Again, a certain number \\"Sit Pretty.\\" The episode then culminates in the \\"Texas Hold 'Em Death Match,\\" which includes four players (until the final two episodes). Players try to double their chip stacks to automatically sit pretty. The first two players to Bust go to head-to-head \\"Sudden Death,\\" same rules as Death Match, where the loser is out of the tournament. When the player count thins down, the format changes a little bit. When six or less players are left in the competition, all players will play in all three opening games. At six players, all chips won in Round 2 carry over to Round 3. When five or fewer players are left, chips won in both Rounds 1 & 2 will carry on. All players still get a fresh $10,000 in chips at the beginning of all games, on top of whatever they carried over from previous rounds. At the end of the three games, the player on top of all the others in chip count goes to the Sitting Pretty couch while the rest go to the Death Match. When the show drops to three players left, there are no Sitting Pretty seats. Instead, the player with the lowest chip count is eliminated from the tournament after the first three games, and the remaining two players battle it out in the Death Match with $500,000 in chips each. Doubling the chips up wins the tournament and the King of Vegas title. The show was recorded in a temporary studio constructed in the parking lot of Bally's Las Vegas.

It was released on January 25, 2006 for the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade. It is the sequel to Marble Blast Gold. It features 60 levels, enhanced graphics, 2 new power-ups and a multiplayer mode. A PC port of the game under the title Marble Blast Online was available at InstantAction until the website was shut down. As of year-end 2010, Marble Blast Ultra has sold over 756,000 copies. Gameplay In Marble Blast Ultra players navigate a marble through obstacles and gaps to reach the finish in sixty levels. In Single player mode, the player has the main goal of reaching the finish pad of the level as fast as possible. Obstacles will hinder the player's progress, but powerups are also provided to help the player finish the level. There are sixty single player levels that can be completed by the player. They are divided into Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced Levels, each category containing twenty levels. Many of these levels (such as 'Survival of the Fittest', 'Natural Selection', and 'Ordeal') are recycled from Marble Blast Gold. There is a par time set for each of the levels, and if the player beats the level under par time, the player will earn achievements based on how many levels they successfully completed under par time. Additionally, if the player has Xbox Live connection, his or her best time will show on a leaderboard where players worldwide can compare their best times. The leaderboard is updated whenever a player gets a new record time. The game makes use of two new power-ups: Ultra blast - instantly increases the blast meter, and adds more power. The player can even perform a double jump. Mega marble - makes the marble bigger, allowing it to knock other marbles off-course. The power-up lasts at least 10 seconds before the marble shrinks back to normal. =Multiplayer= Multiplayer mode contains 20 levels and supports up to 8 simultaneous players. There is only one mode which consists of collecting gems within a certain time limit (three to six minutes), which depends on the level. After a group of 2-6 gems are collected entirely, another set of gems appear elsewhere on the board. Players race to these gems and use power-ups to navigate across the level quicker and interfere with other players. There are three types of gems: red, yellow, and blue. Red gems are worth one point, while yellows are worth two and blues are worth five. Most likely, blue and yellow gems are much harder to get than the red ones. The player at the end of the time limit with the most points wins. Players can change their marble's appearance by choosing from a variety of patterns and pictures in the main menu, such as a globe marble or a tiger marble as well as adding several different effects to use online. Ranked matches and player matches are supported along with an overall multiplayer leaderboard for ranked and player matches. Users can create a game or join one and filter parameters such as level, players, and gamer zone. Private games are also supported. Development and marketing On December 5, 2007, Marble Blast Ultra was made an Xbox Live Arcade Hit and had its price lowered. In 2008, three new achievements totaling 50 gamerscore were added to Marble Blast Ultra on Xbox.com. (registration required) On Wednesday the 29th of October 2008 a new downloadable content pack was made available which contained a new multiplayer level \\"Marble It Up\\". On December 3, 2008 the Marble-Fu map pack was released, and on December 23, 2008 the Agoraphobia pack was released. Each pack contained five maps and was available on InstantAction prior to their Xbox 360 release. On February 12, 2011 Marble Blast Ultra was delisted from the Xbox Live Arcade service resulting in the game being a lost Xbox Live Arcade game as the full version has not resurfaced since. Despite this, a Microsoft Windows version was released later that year. GarageGames, now a subsidiary of Graham Software Development, retained the rights to the Torque Engine which powers Marble Blast Ultra, but not the rights to the game. Game rights are property of InstantAction Holdings. GarageGames CEO Eric Preisz said that it was \\"unlikely\\" that the studio would reacquire the rights to its games.http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/13/marble-blast-ultra-rolls-right-off-of- xbla/ Members of the development team later worked on a spiritual successor, Marble It Up!, which released for the Nintendo Switch in September 2018 and subsequently for Windowshttps://store.steampowered.com/app/864060/Marble_It_Up/ and Apple Arcade.

He was purchased for $80.00 on his way to a slaughterhouse and became a champion in show jumping in the United States during the 1950s. During his career he was known as \\"The Cinderella Horse\\" due to his \\"rags to riches\\" story. Snowman was originally used for farm work and in 1956 was headed for the slaughterhouse at eight years of age. On that day, Harry de Leyer, a Long Island, New York, riding instructor, attended the horse auction in New Holland, Pennsylvania, looking for school horses. He arrived late, and the only remaining horses were those waiting to be loaded into trucks bound for slaughter plants. De Leyer made eye contact with a large gray horse that he purchased for $80. He first used Snowman as a lesson horse for children. De Leyer recognized talent in the horse after he sold him to a neighbor and the horse jumped high fences to return home. De Leyer then began training Snowman as a show jumper. The horse began winning prestigious classes only two years after he was bought off the slaughter truck, and his career lasted five years. He was photographed performing unusual feats such as jumping over other horses,Show Jumping Hall of Fame and his calm disposition made him a favorite. He once won a leadline class and an open jumper championship on the same day. Snowman also appeared on television shows (Johnny Carson's for one, where Carson climbed on his back). He was the subject of two books, had his own fan club, and was flown abroad for \\"guest appearances\\". De Leyer kept Snowman through his retirement until the animal was euthanized in the fall of 1974 due to complications from kidney failure at the age of twenty-six. Snowman was inducted into the United States Show Jumping Hall of Fame in 1992. In 2005, Snowman was made into a Breyer horse model on the Gem Twist mold, which is no longer manufactured. In 2013, Snowman was again introduced in the Breyer line on the Idocus mold. The 2013 model box reads \\"Snowman - Show Jumping Hall of Famer\\". Snowman is the subject of the book, The Eighty Dollar Champion: Snowman, the Horse That Inspired a Nation, by Elizabeth Letts, published by Random House in 2011, a No. 1 New York Times bestseller. A documentary movie was made in 2016, Harry & Snowman, that features original footage of his years as an equestrian family member as well as a show ring competitor.https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/movies/harry-snowman-review.html Snowman was featured in season 21, episode 8 of Mysteries at the Museum.

The duplicated line was going to be about 14 km long and would have allowed for so-called running crosses, where trains in opposing directions need not slow down or stop, and where flights of trains can also pass each other. Due to cost considerations, the length of the passing lanes were reduced to about 6.5 km.

In England, it was governed for the most part by the Agricultural Holdings Acts and the Allotments and Small Holdings Acts. The preceding were reformed by the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995. In Ireland, tenant-right was a custom, prevailing particularly in Ulster, known as the Custom of Ulster, by which the tenant acquired a right not to have his rent raised arbitrarily at the expiration of his term. This resulted in Ulster in considerable fixity of tenure and, in case of a desire on the part of the tenant to sell his farm, made the tenant-right of considerable capital value, amounting often to many years' rent. The Evesham Custom is one example of a tenant-right custom still in 21st century operation, having been given a specific exemption from the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995.

It is one of the most specific tags and it is an artificial antigen to which specific, high affinity monoclonal antibodies have been developed and hence can be used for protein purification by affinity chromatography and also can be used for locating proteins within living cells. It has been used to separate recombinant, overexpressed protein from wild-type protein expressed by the host organism. It can also be used in the isolation of protein complexes with multiple subunits, because its mild purification procedure tends not to disrupt such complexes. It has been used to obtain proteins of sufficient purity and quality to carry out 3D structure determination by x-ray crystallography. A FLAG-tag can be used in many different assays that require recognition by an antibody. If there is no antibody against a given protein, adding a FLAG-tag to a protein allows the protein to be studied with an antibody against the FLAG sequence. Examples are cellular localization studies by immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation or detection by SDS PAGE protein electrophoresis and Western blotting. The peptide sequence of the FLAG-tag from the N-terminus to the C-terminus is: DYKDDDDK (1012 Da). Additionally, it may be used in tandem, commonly the 3xFLAG peptide: DYKDHD-G-DYKDHD-I-DYKDDDDK (with the final tag encoding an enterokinase cleavage site). It can be fused to the C-terminus or the N-terminus of a protein, or inserted within a protein. Some commercially available antibodies (e.g., M1/4E11) recognize the epitope only when it is present at the N-terminus. However, other available antibodies (e.g., M2) are position-insensitive. The tyrosine residue in the FLAG-tag can be sulfated, which can affect antibody recognition of the FLAG epitope. The FLAG-tag can be used in conjunction with other affinity tags, for example a polyhistidine tag (His-tag), HA-tag or myc-tag.  History  The first use of epitope tagging was described by Munro and Pelham in 1984. The FLAG-tag was the second example of a fully functional, improved epitope tag, published in the scientific literature. and was the only epitope tag to be patented.FLAG is a registered trademark of Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC It has since become the most commonly used protein tag in laboratories worldwide. Unlike some other tags (e.g. myc, HA), where a monoclonal antibody was first isolated against an existing protein, then the epitope was characterized and used as a tag, the FLAG epitope was an idealized, artificial design, to which monoclonal antibodies were raised. The FLAG tag's structure was optimized for compatibility with proteins it is attached to, in that it is more hydrophilic than other common epitope tags and therefore less likely to denature or inactivate proteins to which it is appended. In addition, N-terminal FLAG tags can be removed readily from proteins once they have been isolated, by treatment with the specific protease, enterokinase (enteropeptidase). The third report of epitope tagging, (HA-tag), appeared about one year after the Flag system had been first shipped.

Internationally Oporto has more than 100 'eat in' or 'take-away' restaurants in Australia, New Zealand, India, Vietnam, and Europe. It previously also operated stores throughout China, and expanded to Sri Lanka in August 2018. Oporto is also looking to expand its operations into the Middle East, with its first store earmarked for Dubai in early 2020. Founding and history The first Oporto restaurant was founded in 1986 by Ant√≥nio Cerqueira, an Australian of Portuguese descent, in North Bondi, New South Wales, Australia but was originally named Portuguese Style Bondi Charcoal Chicken. The 'Oporto' name came from Cerqueira's favourite football team, FC Porto. Oporto first opened a franchise store in 1995 and was named the fastest growing franchise in Australia in January 2005 by Business Review Weekly. In 2007 there were 100 locations in New South Wales, 14 in Queensland, 8 in Victoria, 5 in the Australian Capital Territory, 5 in South Australia and 6 in New Zealand. Some of these restaurants are called Oporto Express and offer a smaller range of products ‚Äì most commonly this means they do not offer a breakfast menu. Oporto opened their first store in the United Kingdom at London's Victoria Station in January 2009 although this store closed on 18 October 2011, and opened their first restaurant in the United States in Rancho Cucamonga, California on 25 February 2011. Oporto stores in the United States were all converted to Feisty Chicken Grill in 2013. There are now over 100 stores in operation in Australia and New Zealand.

Dschang is the capital of the division of M√©noua. The Bamil√©k√© are the predominant ethnic tribe.  History = Colonial era = The documented history of Dschang began in 1895, when it was invaded by a German military mission. In 1909, the city replaced Fontem as the capital of a Germany military district. The region where Dschang now exists was then not the place of any major settlement but, instead, was an area that two bordering chiefdoms fought over. The name Dschang translates to \\"dispute\\" in the local language. However, some sources believe that Dschang was actually named after one of the chiefdoms which was already called \\"Tsang\\". \\"Tsang\\" in the local language has several meanings; one of the meanings is \\"dispute\\", another one is \\"pimple\\". It is unclear why the kingdom was named \\"Tsang\\" and long before the arrival of the Germans. A source believes that the real tanslation of \\"Tsang\\" as regards to the name of the this chiefdom is \\"pimple\\" because of the infiltration tactic used by this kingdom to conquer neighboring territories. Following Germany's defeat in World War I, Cameroon became a British possession in 1917. The country was subsequently handed over to the French in 1920, who declared Dschang to be the capital of West Province, and developed the city's vacation resort in the 1940s. This resort now forms the basis of Dschang's plans to promote the city as a tourist destination. Dschang military station, circa 1915 = Post-colonial era = On January 1, 1960, Cameroon became an independent state, and the regional administration was moved to the city of Bafoussam. Dschang suffered from this move, as much more effort was invested in the infrastructure of Bafoussam. Following the opening of the Universit√© de Dschang (University of Dschang) in 1993, however, foreign interest and developmental investment of the city began to increase, and plans for a drive to increase tourism and the exploitation of mineral deposits will contribute to the city's current development. The current Mayor of Dschang is Baudelaire Donfack. Economy and infrastructure Dschang market Due to its high elevation of over 1400 m,Location & Climate Dschang is favoured by relatively cool temperatures and attractive scenery.

Centrifugal force shaped the hot globe of glass into a round, flat sheet. The sheet would then be broken off the pipe and trimmed to form a rectangular window to fit into a frame. At the center of a piece of crown glass, a thick remnant of the original blown bottle neck would remain, hence the name \\"bullseye\\". Optical distortions produced by the bullseye could be reduced by grinding the glass. The development of diaper latticed windows was in part because three regular diamond-shaped panes could be conveniently cut from a piece of Crown glass, with minimum waste and with minimum distortion. This method for manufacturing flat glass panels was very expensive and could not be used to make large panes. It was replaced in the 19th century by the cylinder, sheet, and rolled plate processes, but it is still used in traditional construction and restoration. Cylinder glass In this manufacturing process, glass is blown into a cylindrical iron mould. The ends are cut off and a cut is made down the side of the cylinder. The cut cylinder is then placed in an oven where the cylinder unrolls into a flat glass sheets. Drawn Sheet glass (Fourcault process) The uneven surface of old glass is visible in the reflection on this window pane. Drawn Sheet glass was made by dipping a leader into a vat of molten glass then pulling that leader straight up while a film of glass hardened just out of the vat ‚Äì this is known as the Fourcault process. This film or ribbon was pulled up continuously held by tractors on both edges while it cooled. After 12 metres or so it was cut off the vertical ribbon and tipped down to be further cut. This glass is clear but has thickness variations due to small temperature changes just out of the vat as it was hardening. These variations cause lines of slight distortions. This glass may still be seen in older houses. Float glass replaced this process. Cast plate glass Developed by James Hartledsay in 1848. The glass is taken from the furnace in large iron ladles, which are carried upon slings running on overhead rails; from the ladle the glass is thrown upon the cast-iron bed of a rolling-table; and is rolled into sheet by an iron roller, the process being similar to that employed in making plate-glass, but on a smaller scale. The sheet thus rolled is roughly trimmed while hot and soft, so as to remove those portions of glass which have been spoiled by immediate contact with the ladle, and the sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an annealing tunnel or temperature-controlled oven called a lehr, down which it is carried by a system of rollers. Polished plate glass The polished plate glass process starts with sheet or rolled plate glass. This glass is dimensionally inaccurate and often created visual distortions. These rough panes were ground flat and then polished clear. This was a fairly expensive process. Before the float process, mirrors were plate glass as sheet glass had visual distortions that were akin to those seen in amusement park or funfair mirrors. Rolled plate (figured) glass Figure rolled glass The elaborate patterns found on figured (or 'Cathedral') rolled-plate glass are produced in a similar fashion to the rolled plate glass process except that the plate is cast between two rollers, one of which carries a pattern. On occasion, both rollers can carry a pattern. The pattern is impressed upon the sheet by a printing roller which is brought down upon the glass as it leaves the main rolls while still soft. This glass shows a pattern in high relief. The glass is then annealed in a lehr. The glass used for this purpose is typically whiter in colour than the clear glasses used for other applications. Only some of the figured glasses may be toughened, dependent on the depth of the embossed pattern. Single rolled figured glass, where the pattern is only imprinted into one surface, may be laminated to produce a safety glass. The much less common 'double rolled figured glass', where the pattern is embossed into both surfaces, can not be made into a safety glass but will already be thicker than average figured plate to accommodate both patterned faces. The finished thickness being dependent on the imprinted design. Float glass Ninety percent of the world's flat glass is produced by the float glass process invented in the 1950s by Sir Alastair Pilkington of Pilkington Glass, in which molten glass is poured onto one end of a molten tin bath. The glass floats on the tin, and levels out as it spreads along the bath, giving a smooth face to both sides. The glass cools and slowly solidifies as it travels over the molten tin and leaves the tin bath in a continuous ribbon. The glass is then annealed by cooling in an oven called a lehr. The finished product has near-perfect parallel surfaces. The side of the glass that has been in contact with the tin has a very small amount of the tin embedded in its surface. This quality makes that side of the glass easier to be coated in order to turn it into a mirror, however that side is also softer and easier to scratch. Glass is produced in standard metric thicknesses of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 19 and 25 mm, with 10mm being the most popular sizing in the architectural industry. Molten glass floating on tin in a nitrogen/hydrogen atmosphere will spread out to a thickness of about 6 mm and stop due to surface tension. Thinner glass is made by stretching the glass while it floats on the tin and cools. Similarly, thicker glass is pushed back and not permitted to expand as it cools on the tin. Prism glass Prism glass is architectural glass which bends light. It was frequently used around the turn of the 20th century to provide natural light to underground spaces and areas far from windows. Prism glass can be found on sidewalks, where it is known as vault lighting,Ian Macky: Prism glass in windows, partitions, and canopies, where it is known as prism tiles, and as deck prisms, which were used to light spaces below deck on sailing ships. It could be highly ornamented; Frank Lloyd Wright created over forty different designs for prism tiles. Modern architectural prism lighting is generally done with a plastic film applied to ordinary window glass. Glass block Glass bricks used in a wall Sidewalk skylight (also named 'pavement light') outside Burlington House, London Glass block, also known as glass brick, is an architectural element made from glass used in areas where privacy or visual obscuration is desired while admitting light, such as underground parking garages, washrooms, and municipal swimming baths. Glass block was originally developed in the early 1900s to provide natural light in industrial factories. Annealed glass Annealed glass is glass without internal stresses caused by heat treatment, i.e., rapid cooling, or by toughening or heat strengthening. Glass becomes annealed if it is heated above a transition point then allowed to cool slowly, without being quenched. Float glass is annealed during the process of manufacture. However, most toughened glass is made from float glass that has been specially heat-treated. Annealed glass breaks into large, jagged shards that can cause serious injury and is considered a hazard in architectural applications. Building codes in many parts of the world restrict the use of annealed glass in areas where there is a high risk of breakage and injury, for example in bathrooms, door panels, fire exits and at low heights in schools or domestic houses. Safety glass, such as laminated or tempered must be used in these settings to reduce risk of injury. Laminated glass Broken tempered laminated glass \\"wet blanket effect\\" Laminated glass is manufactured by bonding two or more layers of glass together with an interlayer, such as PVB, under heat and pressure, to create a single sheet of glass. When broken, the interlayer keeps the layers of glass bonded and prevents it from breaking apart. The interlayer can also give the glass a higher sound insulation rating. There are several types of laminated glasses manufactured using different types of glass and interlayers which produce different results when broken. Laminated glass that is made up of annealed glass is normally used when safety is a concern, but tempering is not an option. Windshields are typically laminated glasses. When broken, the PVB layer prevents the glass from breaking apart, creating a \\"spider web\\" cracking pattern. Tempered laminated glass is designed to shatter into small pieces, preventing possible injury. When both pieces of glass are broken it produces a \\"wet blanket\\" effect and it will fall out of its opening. Heat strengthened laminated glass is stronger than annealed, but not as strong as tempered. It is often used where security is a concern. It has a larger break pattern than tempered, but because it holds its shape (unlike the \\"wet blanket\\" effect of tempered laminated glass) it remains in the opening and can withstand more force for a longer period of time, making it much more difficult to get through. Laminated glass has similar properties to ballistic glass, but the two should not be confused. Both are made using a PVB interlayer, but they have drastically different tensile strength. Ballistic glass and laminated glass are both rated to different standards and have a different shatter pattern. Heat-strengthened glass Heat-strengthened glass, or tempered glass, is glass that has been heat treated to induce surface compression, but not to the extent of causing it to \\"dice\\" on breaking in the manner of tempered glass. On breaking, heat-strengthened glass breaks into sharp pieces that are typically somewhat smaller than those found on breaking annealed glass, and is intermediate in strength between annealed and toughened glasses. Heat-strengthened glass can take a strong direct hit without shattering, but has a weak edge. By simply tapping the edge of heat-strengthened glass with a solid object, it is possible to shatter the entire sheet. Chemically strengthened glass Chemically strengthened glass is a type of glass that has increased strength. When broken it still shatters in long pointed splinters similar to float (annealed) glass. For this reason, it is not considered a safety glass and must be laminated if a safety glass is required. Chemically strengthened glass is typically six to eight times the strength of annealed glass. The glass is chemically strengthened by submerging the glass in a bath containing a potassium salt (typically potassium nitrate) at . This causes sodium ions in the glass surface to be replaced by potassium ions from the bath solution. Unlike toughened glass, chemically strengthened glass may be cut after strengthening, but loses its added strength within the region of approximately 20 mm of the cut. Similarly, when the surface of chemically strengthened glass is deeply scratched, this area loses its additional strength. Chemically strengthened glass was used on some fighter aircraft canopies. Low-emissivity glass Glass coated with a low-emissivity substance can reflect radiant infrared energy, encouraging radiant heat to remain on the same side of the glass from which it originated, while letting visible light pass. This often results in more efficient windows because radiant heat originating from indoors in winter is reflected back inside, while infrared heat radiation from the sun during summer is reflected away, keeping it cooler inside. Heatable glass Electrically heatable glass is a relatively new product, which helps to find solutions while designing buildings and vehicles. The idea of heating glass is based on usage of energy- efficient low-emissive glass that is generally simple silicate glass with special metallic oxides coating. Heatable glass can be used in all kinds of standard glazing systems, made of wood, plastic, aluminum or steel. Self- cleaning glass A recent (2001 Pilkington Glass) innovation is so-called self-cleaning glass, aimed at building, automotive and other technical applications. A nanometre-scale coating of titanium dioxide on the outer surface of glass introduces two mechanisms which lead to the self-cleaning property. The first is a photo-catalytic effect, in which ultra-violet rays catalyse the breakdown of organic compounds on the window surface; the second is a hydrophilic effect in which water is attracted to the surface of the glass, forming a thin sheet which washes away the broken-down organic compounds. Insulating glass Insulating glass, or double glazing, consists of a window or glazing element of two or more layers of glazing separated by a spacer along the edge and sealed to create a dead air space between the layers. This type of glazing has functions of thermal insulation and noise reduction. When the space is filled with an inert gas it is part of energy conservation sustainable architecture design for low energy buildings. Evacuated glazing A 1994 innovation for insulated glazing is evacuated glass, which as yet is produced commercially only in Japan and China.Sumitomo Group Public Affairs World‚Äôs First Evacuated Glazing Glass The extreme thinness of evacuated glazing offers many new architectural possibilities, particularly in building conservation and historicist architecture, where evacuated glazing can replace traditional single glazing, which is much less energy-efficient. An evacuated glazing unit is made by sealing the edges of two glass sheets, typically by using a solder glass, and evacuating the space inside with a vacuum pump. The evacuated space between the two sheets can be very shallow and yet be a good insulator, yielding insulative window glass with nominal thicknesses as low as 6 mm overall. The reasons for this low thickness are deceptively complex, but the potential insulation is good essentially because there can be no convection or gaseous conduction in a vacuum. Unfortunately, evacuated glazing does have some disadvantages; its manufacture is complicated and difficult. For example, a necessary stage in the manufacture of evacuated glazing is outgassing; that is, heating it to liberate any gases adsorbed on the inner surfaces, which could otherwise later escape and destroy the vacuum. This heating process currently means that evacuated glazing cannot be toughened or heat-strengthened. If an evacuated safety glass is required, the glass must be laminated. The high temperatures necessary for outgassing also tend to destroy the highly effective \\"soft\\" low- emissivity coatings that are often applied to one or both of the internal surfaces (i.e. the ones facing the air gap) of other forms of modern insulative glazing, in order to prevent loss of heat through infrared radiation. Slightly less effective \\"hard\\" coatings are still suitable for evacuated glazing, however. Furthermore, because of the atmospheric pressure present on the outside of an evacuated glazing unit, its two glass sheets must somehow be held apart in order to prevent them flexing together and touching each other, which would defeat the object of evacuating the unit. The task of holding the panes apart is performed by a grid of spacers, which typically consist of small stainless steel discs that are placed around 20 mm apart. The spacers are small enough that they are visible only at very close distances, typically up to 1 m. However, the fact that the spacers will conduct some heat often leads in cold weather to the formation of temporary, grid-shaped patterns on the surface of an evacuated window, consisting either of small circles of interior condensation centred around the spacers, where the glass is slightly colder than average, or, when there is dew outside, small circles on the exterior face of the glass, in which the dew is absent because the spacers make the glass near them slightly warmer. The conduction of heat between the panes, caused by the spacers, tends to limit evacuated glazing's overall insulative effectiveness. Nevertheless, evacuated glazing is still as insulative as much thicker conventional double glazing and tends to be stronger, since the two constituent glass sheets are pressed together by the atmosphere, and hence react practically as one thick sheet to bending forces. Evacuated glazing also offers very good sound insulation in comparison with other popular types of window glazing. Building code seismic requirements The most current building code enforced in most jurisdictions in the United States is the 2006 International Building Code (IBC, 2006). The 2006 IBC references for the 2005 edition of the standard Minimum Design Loads for buildings and other Structures prepared by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE, 2005) for its seismic provisions. ASCE 7-05 contains specific requirements for nonstructural components including requirements for architectural glass. Danger of reflected sunlight If incorrectly designed, concave surfaces with extensive amounts of glass can act as solar concentrators depending on the angle of the sun, potentially injuring people and damaging property.Reflected light from London skyscraper melts car  Toughened glass  Toughened (or tempered) glass is made from standard Float Glass to create an impact resistant, safety glass. If float glass is broken it will break into very sharp, hazardous pieces of glass. The process of toughening the glass introduces tensions between internal and external surfaces of a glass panel to increase its strength and also to ensure in the case of breakages the glass shatters into small, harmless pieces of glass. The cut glass panels are put into a toughening furnace. Here the glass panels are heated to upward of 600 degrees C and then the surfaces are cooled rapidly with cold air. This produces tensile stresses on the surface of the glass with the warmer internal glass particles. As the top thickness of the glass cools it contracts and forces the corresponding glass elements to contract to introduce stresses into the glass panel and increasing strength.

It relies on measuring the supply current (Idd) in the quiescent state (when the circuit is not switching and inputs are held at static values). The current consumed in the state is commonly called Iddq for Idd (quiescent) and hence the name. Iddq testing uses the principle that in a correctly operating quiescent CMOS digital circuit, there is no static current path between the power supply and ground, except for a small amount of leakage. Many common semiconductor manufacturing faults will cause the current to increase by orders of magnitude, which can be easily detected. This has the advantage of checking the chip for many possible faults with one measurement. Another advantage is that it may catch faults that are not found by conventional stuck-at fault test vectors. Iddq testing is somewhat more complex than just measuring the supply current. If a line is shorted to Vdd, for example, it will still draw no extra current if the gate driving the signal is attempting to set it to '1'. However, a different input that attempts to set the signal to 0 will show a large increase in quiescent current, signalling a bad part. Typical Iddq tests may use 20 or so inputs. Note that Iddq test inputs require only controllability, and not observability. This is because the observability is through the shared power supply connection. Advantages and disadvantages Iddq testing has many advantages: *It is a simple and direct test that can identify physical defects. *The area and design time overhead are very low. *Test generation is fast. *Test application time is fast since the vector sets are small. *It catches some defects that other tests, particularly stuck-at logic tests, do not. Drawback: Compared to scan chain testing, Iddq testing is time consuming, and thus more expensive, as is achieved by current measurements that take much more time than reading digital pins in mass production.  Future of Iddq testing  As device geometry shrinks, i.e transistors and gates become smaller resulting in larger and more complex processors and SoCs (see Moore's law), the leakage current becomes much higher and less predictable. This makes it difficult to tell a low leakage part with a defect from a naturally high leakage part. Also, increasing circuit size means a single fault will have a lower percentage effect, making it harder for the test to detect. However, Iddq is so useful that designers are taking steps to keep it working. One particular technique that helps is power gating, where the entire power supply to each block can be switched off using a low leakage switch. This allows each block to be tested individually or in combination, which makes the tests much easier when compared to testing the whole chip.  References  Further reading   (NB.

It carries programming from Fox Sports Radio, as well as the Dan Patrick Show (Patrick was originally an on-air personality on sister station WTUE under his real name, Dan Pugh). Its studios are located just outside downtown Dayton and its transmitter is in Kettering, Ohio. History The station took the air in 1949, licensed to Skyland Broadcasting Corp. It was sold in 1961 to Brush-Moore Newspapers, publisher of the Canton Repository. In 1965 the station was sold to Group One Broadcasting of Akron, owner of WAKR. During the mid 1960s WONE was known as \\"Channel 98,\\" and it was one of Dayton's two popular Top 40 stations, the other being WING. The format changed to adult contemporary around 1967, when it was called \\"Charisma Radio\\". Sometime thereafter, around 1969 it switched to country music calling itself \\"One Country\\" or \\"Country-Wide W-1\\" to remain synonymous with its then-owner Group One. =Changes of ownership= On September 8, 1986, Group One was dissolved, and the station was sold to DKM Broadcasting. (One year beforehand, Group One obtained permission to place the WONE call sign on WAKR's FM sister station in Akron.) WONE's ownership passed to Stoner Broadcasting on December 9, 1992, to American Radio Systems on September 13, 1993, and to Jacor Communications on October 17, 1997. =Modern Country format= During most of the station‚Äôs years of programming country music, WONE did well in the Dayton market ratings, usually scoring first or second place in ratings among adults 18‚Äì49 years of age. The weekday programming lineup for most of the country years started with David G. McFarland in the ‚Äúmorning drive‚Äù time period, followed by Jim Howell (9-Noon), John Ross (Noon-4), Terry Wood (program director) from 4-7PM. The 7P-Midnight show was hosted over the years by Dean Taylor, Ed Riley and Chuck Wheeler. After-midnight shifts and weekends were hosted by Lee Nolan, Jim Lyons and others. =Adult standards= After 25 years as a country music station, WONE changed from \\"98 Country\\" to Adult Standards, Dayton's ONE for Original Hits, on November 29, 1994 and acquired Springfield-based former Top 40 giant WIZE along the way (which at the time also aired adult standards). WIZE since then virtually simulcast all of WONE's programming until April 22, 2011, when WIZE broke away to launch a country format aimed specifically at the Springfield region. =Switch to sports talk= WONE adopted its present sports talk format on December 8, 2003, (as \\"980 Sports ONE\\") again competing with WING, then adopted the \\"Homer\\" nickname and weekday programming associated with WSAI 1360-AM (now on WCKY 1530-AM) in 2005. This simulcast with WCKY would eventually be severed in 2007, when WONE would start to air local sports talk in the afternoon, as well as clearing Fox Sports Radio in the morning hours (which eventually led to a clearance of Dayton native Dan Patrick's late morning show.) They are now known as Fox Sports 980. The station airs mostly Fox Sports Radio with one local show.

Latur city is the district headquarters and is the 16th largest city in the state of Maharashtra.In the 2011 census, Latur City had a population of 382,754.There is a proposal to carve out a new district Udgir district from Latur district.Udgir city is the largest city and tehsil after Latur in Latur district The district is primarily agricultural. Urban population comprises 25.47% of the total population. History Latur has an ancient history, which probably dates to the Rashtrakuta period. It was home to a branch of Rashtrakutas which ruled the Deccan 753-973 AD. The first Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga was from Lattalur, probably the ancient name for Latur. Anecdotally, Ratnapur is mentioned as a name for Latur. The King Amoghavarsha of Avinash developed Latur city, originally the native place of the Rashtrakutas. The Rashtrakutas who succeeded the Chalukyas of Badami in 753 AD called themselves the residents of Lattalur. It was, over the centuries, ruled by the Satavahanas, the Sakas, the Chalukyas, the Yadavas of Deogiri, the Delhi Sultans, the Bahamani rulers of South India, Adilshahi, and the Mughals. In the 17th century, it became part of the independent princely state of Hyderabad. Under the Hyderabad of Nizams, the tax system was reformed and many of the exploitative taxing practices were ended. In 1905 it was merged with surrounding areas, renamed Latur tehsil, and became part of Osmanabad district, which until 1948 was a part of Hyderabad Kingdom under the Nizams. The chief of Nizam's Razakar army Qasim Rizwi was from Latur. After independence and the merger of Hyderabad with the Indian Union, Osmanabad became part of Bombay Province. In 1960, with the creation of Maharashtra, Osmanabad was one of its districts. Because of the concerted efforts of Former Cooperation minister Keshavrao Sonawane and then newly elected member of assembly Vilasrao Deshmukh on 16 August 1982, a separate Latur district was carved out of Osmanabad district. In Latur's Papvinashak Temple a 12th- century inscription of King Someshvara III was found. According to that inscription, 500 scholars were living in Lattlaur (Latur) at that time and that Latur was the city of King Someshwar.  Geography  Latur district is in the Marathwada region in Maharashtra in India, located between 17¬∞52' North to 18¬∞50' North and 76¬∞18' East to 79¬∞12' East in the Deccan plateau. It has an average elevation of above mean sea level. The entire district of Latur is on the Balaghat plateau, 540 to 638 metres from the mean sea level.

It became the standard for secondary, higher secondary, and university education in the Maharashtra state of India. This educational technique has become widely adopted in other parts of the state due to the success of student's in Maharashtra on the standardized Common Entrance Examinations (CET).

They belong to Central Railway Latur railway station was built again when the Barshi railway line was converted from narrow gauge to broad gauge. The railway gauge was converted in September 2007 from Latur to Osmanabad and in October 2008 from Osmanabad to Kurduvadi. Latur is now is connected to Mumbai by a direct train via Kurduvadi (train number 1006 from Latur and 1005 from Mumbai). It is connected to Hyderabad by train number 7013 that originates at Osmanabad.Train Timetable Latur With the introduction of train number 1005 via Kurduvadi in October 2008, the earlier train connecting Latur to Latur Road, Parbhani and Aurangabad was discontinued. The important railway stations are Latur, Latur Road and Udgir. The district has 148 km of broad gauge railway line. The railway line from Latur to Kurduwadi to Miraj was narrow gauge. The Kurduwadi-Pandharpur section towards Miraj was converted to broad gauge in 2002. The Latur to Osmanabad section was converted to broad gauge in September 2007. (Osmanabad did not lie on the narrow gauge railway line and the alignment was changed for the new broad gauge track to pass through Osmanabad.) The Osmanabad-Kurduwadi section of broad gauge track became operational in October 2008. The Pandharpur-Miraj section was also narrow gauge earlier and the conversion to broad gauge is done on priority. This is very important route to Goa. Trains will help them achieve Konkan and Goan markets and hence the poor economy of these people will improve.

Latur Earthquake of 1993 Latur had a devastating, though only midly severe, earthquake on 30 September 1993 resulting in a huge loss of life. The earthquake measured only 6.3 on the Richter scale but more than 30,000 people were estimated to have died mainly due to poor construction of houses and village huts made of stones which just collapsed on people who were fast asleep in early morning hours. It struck southern Marathwada region of Maharashtra state in central-western part of India and affected Latur, Beed, Osmanabad and adjoining districts about 400 km south-east of Mumbai (Bombay). It was an intra-plate earthquake. Latur was almost completely destroyed and life came to a standstill.

It is generally considered more conservative than the preceding Rehnquist Court, as well as the most conservative court since the 1940s Vinson Court. This is due to the retirement of moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and the subsequent confirmation of the more conservative Justice Samuel Alito in her place. Membership Roberts was originally nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who had decided to retire from the Court, effective with the confirmation of her successor. However, before the Senate could act upon Roberts' nomination to be an Associate Justice, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died, and President Bush nominated Roberts for the Chief Justice vacancy. Roberts' nomination as Chief Justice was confirmed by the Senate in 2005. Roberts took the Constitutional oath of office, administered by senior Associate Justice John Paul Stevens (who was the acting Chief Justice during the vacancy) at the White House, on September 29, 2005, almost immediately after his confirmation. On October 3, Roberts took the judicial oath provided for by the Judiciary Act of 1789, prior to the first oral arguments of the 2005 term. The Roberts Court commenced with Roberts as Chief Justice and eight holdovers from the Rehnquist Court: Stevens, O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer. President Bush nominated Samuel Alito (after the withdrawal of Bush's first nominee, White House Counsel Harriet Miers) to replace O'Connor, and he was confirmed in January 2006. In 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor to replace Souter, and in 2010 Obama nominated Elena Kagan to replace Stevens. After six years, Justice Scalia died in February 2016. In the following month Obama nominated Merrick Garland, but Garland's nomination was never considered by the Senate, and it expired when the Senate's 114th Congress ended and the 115th Congress began on January 3, 2017. Eleven days after the 2017 Inauguration, on January 31, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to replace Scalia. Democrats in the Senate filibustered the Gorsuch nomination, which led to the Republicans exercising the \\"nuclear option\\". After that, Gorsuch was confirmed in April 2017. On July 9, 2018, Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace Kennedy (who retired on July 31), and he was confirmed on October 6, 2018. Justice Ginsburg died on September 18, 2020; Trump has nominated Amy Coney Barrett to succeed her. =Timeline=Other branches Presidents during this court have included George W. Bush, Barack H. Obama, and Donald J. Trump. Congresses included 109th through the current 116th United States Congresses. Rulings of the Court The Roberts Court (October 2018 ‚Äì September 2020): Front row (left to right): Stephen Breyer, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts (Chief Justice), Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Samuel A. Alito. Back row (left to right): Neil Gorsuch, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Brett Kavanaugh The Roberts court has issued major rulings on incorporation of the Bill of Rights, gun control, affirmative action, campaign finance regulation, abortion, capital punishment, gay rights, unlawful search and seizure, and criminal sentencing. Major decisions of the Roberts Court include: *Massachusetts v. EPA (2007): In a 5‚Äì4 decision in which the majority opinion was delivered by Justice Stevens, the Supreme Court upheld the Environmental Protection Agency's right to regulate carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act. *District of Columbia v. Heller (2008): In a 5‚Äì4 decision in which the majority opinion was delivered by Justice Scalia, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment applies to federal enclaves, and that the amendment protects the right of individuals to possess a firearm, regardless of service in a militia. McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), in a 5‚Äì4 decision written by Justice Alito, extended this protection to the states. *Ashcroft v. Iqbal (2009): In a 5‚Äì4 decision written by Justice Kennedy, the court reversed the Second Circuit's decision not to dismiss a suit against former Attorney General John Ashcroft and others that claimed that the FBI engaged in discriminatory activities following the 9/11 attacks. The court also extended the heightened pleading standard established in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly (2006), which had previously applied only to antitrust law. The number of dismissals greatly increased after the Iqbal ruling. *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010): In a 5‚Äì4 decision in which the majority opinion was delivered by Justice Kennedy, the Court held that the provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act which regulated independent expenditures in political campaigns by corporations, unions, and non-profits violated First Amendment freedom of speech rights. *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012): In a 5‚Äì4 decision written by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including the individual mandate to buy health insurance. The mandate was upheld as part of Congress's power of taxation. In a subsequent case, King v. Burwell (2015), the Court upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, this time in a 6‚Äì3 opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts. *Arizona v. United States (2012): In a 5‚Äì3 decision delivered by Justice Kennedy, the Court held that portions of Arizona SB 1070, an Arizona law regarding immigration, unconstitutionally usurped the federal authority to regulate immigration laws and enforcement. *Shelby County v. Holder (2013): In a 5‚Äì4 decision delivered by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court struck down Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided a coverage formula for Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The latter section requires certain states and jurisdictions to obtain federal preclearance before changing voting laws or practices, in an effort to prevent those states and jurisdictions from discriminating against voters. Without a coverage formula, Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is no longer in effect. *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014): In a 5‚Äì4 decision delivered by Justice Alito, the Court exempted closely held corporations from the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate on the basis of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. *Riley v. California (2014): The Court unanimously held that the warrantless search and seizure of digital contents of a cell phone during an arrest is unconstitutional. *Obergefell v.

United States (2018): In a 5‚Äì4 decision written by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court held that government acquisition of cell-site records is a Fourth Amendment search, and, thus, generally requires a warrant. *Timbs v. Indiana (2019): In a unanimous decision, the Court ruled that the \\"excessive fines\\" clause of the Eighth Amendment is incorporated against state and local governments, affecting the use of civil forfeitures. *Rucho v. Common Cause (2019): In a 5‚Äì4 decision written by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court held that partisan gerrymandering claims present nonjusticiable political questions. *Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia (2020): In a 6‚Äì3 decision, the Court ruled that Title VII employment protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 do extend to cover gender identity and sexual orientation. Judicial philosophy The Roberts Court has been described as \\"conservative in most cases, liberal in some,\\" with (prior to the death of Justice Scalia) five conservative-leaning justices and four liberal-leaning justices. Alito, Thomas, Kennedy, Roberts, and Scalia generally have taken more conservative positions, while Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan have generally taken more liberal positions. Souter and Stevens had also been part of the liberal bloc prior to their respective retirements. These two blocs of voters have lined up together in several major cases, though Justice Kennedy has often sided with the liberal bloc. Roberts has also served as a swing vote, often advocating for narrow rulings and compromise among the two blocs of Justices. Though the Court often does divide along ideological lines, attorney and SCOTUSblog founder Tom Goldstein has noted that many cases are decided 9‚Äì0 and that the individual judges hold a wide array of views. The judicial philosophy of Roberts on the Supreme Court has been assessed by leading court commentators including Jeffrey Rosen and Marcia Coyle.Marcia Coyle, The Roberts Court: The Struggle for the Constitution, 2013. Although Roberts is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, his vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012) upholding the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has caused reflection in the press concerning the comparative standing of his conservative judicial philosophy compared to other sitting justices of conservative orientation; he is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when his vote to uphold the ACA is compared to Rehnquist's vote in Bush v. Gore.Scalia, Antonin; Garner, Bryan A. (2008) Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges (St. Paul: Thomson West) . Regarding Roberts' contemporaneous peers on the bench, his judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than that of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Unlike Scalia, Roberts has not indicated any particularly enhanced reading of originalism or framer's intentions as has been plainly evident in Scalia's speeches and writings. Roberts' strongest inclination on the Court has been to attempt to re-establish the centrist orientation of the Court as being party neutral, in contrast to his predecessor Rehnquist who had devoted significant effort to promote a states rights orientation for the Court. Roberts' voting pattern reflecting his conservative judicial philosophy is most closely aligned to Samuel Alito on the Court, the latter of whom has also become associated with libertarian trends in the conservative judicial philosophy.

Hence, the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and Cesare Beccaria remains a relevant social philosophy in policy term for using punishment as a deterrent through law enforcement, the courts, and imprisonment. Discussion When crime and recidivism are perceived to be a problem, the first political reaction is to call for increased policing, stiffer penalties, and increased monitoring and surveillance for those released on parole. Intuitively, politicians see a correlation between the certainty and severity of punishment, and the choice whether to commit crime. The practical intention has always been to deter and, if that failed, to keep society safer for the longest possible period of time by locking the habitual offenders away in prisons (see Wilson). From the earliest theorists, the arguments were based on morality and social utility, and it was not until comparatively recently that there has been empirical research to determine whether punishment is an effective deterrent. =Social control theory= As represented in the work of Travis Hirschi, the Social Control Theory proposes that exploiting the process of socialisation and Social Learning Theory builds self-control and reduces the inclination to indulge in behavior recognized as antisocial. It is based on Functionalist theories of crime and proposes that there are three types of control: *Direct: by which punishment is threatened or applied for wrongful behaviour, and compliance is rewarded by parents, family, and authority figures. *Indirect: by which a youth refrains from delinquency because his or her delinquent act might cause pain and disappointment to parents and others with whom he or she has close relationships. *Internal: by which a person's conscience or sense of guilt prevents him or her from engaging in delinquent acts. =Drift theory= Although it was not presented as a Social Control Theory, David Matza (1964) also adopted the concept of emphasised frustration and rebelliousness against normative social values by delinquent youth. Matza did not identify any specific constraints or controls that would keep youth from drifting, but drifters were depicted as youth who have few stakes in conformity and are free to drift into delinquency. As with Hirschi, Matza was skeptical that deviancy could be explained in terms of distinct subcultural or countercultural value systems. Free will. Delinquent youth were neither compelled nor committed to their delinquent actions, but were simply less receptive to other more conventional traditions (1964:28). Thus, delinquent youth were \\"drifting\\" between criminal and non-criminal behaviour, and were relatively free to choose whether to take part in delinquency. This challenged the Strain Theory. =Rational choice theory= Rational choice theory grew out of the expected utility principle in economic theory, i.e. that people will make rational decisions based on their expectations for utility maximization. To that extent, it fits the model of utilitarianism as proposed by the Classical School, but its implications are doubted by the Neoclassical School. Modern research Initial studies compared homicide statistics between states using and not using capital punishment, and found no evidence of deterrence (Bailey & Peterson). Studies then tested certainty as against severity of punishment, e.g. Erickson (1977). The research methodologies used are either the analysis of Official Statistics for objective indicators of correlations, and attitudinal interviews and questionnaires for subjective indicators (potential criminals will not be deterred unless they understand how the criminal justice system works). The research finds that the majority conform to the law because they subscribe to the social and moral values represented by the law (i.e. the process of socialisation is effective). Hence, at best, the threat of punishment has a not statistically insignificant effect on reported crime and the empirical evidence in support of deterrence is very limited. Raymond Paternoster's work (see bibliography ) demonstrates that the only statistically significant data emerges from experiential studies among those who have been through the criminal justice system (i.e. specific deterrence), but that this data on its own cannot validate general deterrence. He also finds no evidence that formal social controls are effective. Some informal social negative consequences such as the disapproval of family, loss of reputation, possible loss of employment, etc., are more significant. There is also strong evidence that increasing the rewards of conformity by providing better employment opportunities at realistic rates of pay can achieve comparable deterrent effect by giving potential offenders more to lose (Tierney:1996, 277).

It was originally subtitled 'A Magazine of Literature for Our Boys and Girls'. Established during World War One, the magazine was intended to expand the range of reading material available to New South Wales primary school students. Stephen Henry Smith was the magazine's first editor, followed by Doris Chadwick, who held the position of editor from 1922 to 1959. Over its 100-year history, its editors have included some of the best known names of Australian children's literature: Noreen Shelley, Patricia Wrightson, Lilith Norman, Duncan Ball, Anna Fienberg, Jonathan Shaw and Tohby Riddle. The list of past and present editorial staff features many authors who have been recognised by awards or by popular acclaim: these include Joanne Horniman, Dianne Bates, Cassandra Golds, Margrete Lamond, Geoffrey McSkimming, Ursula Dubosarsky and Sue Murray. Some of the many illustrators are Kim Gamble, Tohby Riddle, Aaron Blabey, Stephen Axelsen, Noela Young, Craig Phillips, Sarah Davis] and David Legge. The School Magazine publishes four literary magazines for children: Countdown (), Blast Off (), Orbit () and Touchdown (. Each 36-page full-colour magazine contains a mix of stories, plays, poetry, nonfiction articles, book reviews, puzzles, comic serials and other texts. Published continually since February 1916, the School Magazine is the oldest magazine in Australia and the longest running literary magazine for children in the world. The magazine has thrived as a showpiece of original writing for children from authors in Australia, New Zealand, the US, India, the UK, and a number of Asian, Pacific and African nations. The magazine has played and continues to play a role in fostering new talent in writing for children. In particular, it is the largest publisher of poetry for children in Australia. A number of children's writers and illustrators who are now justly celebrated were first published by The School Magazine, which still accepts unsolicited manuscripts. To foster literacy skills, the School Magazine also publishes Teaching Units, which offer lesson plans and worksheets to assist teachers in maximising the use of the literary material with their students.

In logic, mathematics and theoretical computer science, a Boolean domain is usually written as {0, 1}, or \\\\mathbb{B}. The algebraic structure that naturally builds on a Boolean domain is the Boolean algebra with two elements. The initial object in the category of bounded lattices is a Boolean domain. In computer science, a Boolean variable is a variable that takes values in some Boolean domain. Some programming languages feature reserved words or symbols for the elements of the Boolean domain, for example \`false\` and \`true\`. However, many programming languages do not have a Boolean datatype in the strict sense. In C or BASIC, for example, falsity is represented by the number 0 and truth is represented by the number 1 or ‚àí1, and all variables that can take these values can also take any other numerical values.  Generalizations  The Boolean domain {0, 1} can be replaced by the unit interval , in which case rather than only taking values 0 or 1, any value between and including 0 and 1 can be assumed. Algebraically, negation (NOT) is replaced with 1-x, conjunction (AND) is replaced with multiplication (xy), and disjunction (OR) is defined via De Morgan's law to be 1-(1-x)(1-y). Interpreting these values as logical truth values yields a multi-valued logic, which forms the basis for fuzzy logic and probabilistic logic. In these interpretations, a value is interpreted as the \\"degree\\" of truth ‚Äì to what extent a proposition is true, or the probability that the proposition is true.

She is best known for trying to prevent Eminem from entering Canada for a concert in October 2000 because of his misogynist lyrics. She has also lobbied to have the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) use existing legislation that she believed should censor Howard Stern. She is the author of the Action Agenda: A Strategic Blueprint for Reducing Exposure to Media Violence in Canada, a report funded and published by the Ontario Office for Victims of Crime, an agency of the Ministry of the Attorney General. Smith operates the Free Radical web site to provide information on violent media and strategies to combat it.  Activism  Smith successfully lobbied Bell Mobility to get them to cease selling \\"Pimptones\\", skits of \\"pimps, players, and hos\\" retailed for $2.50 to replace standard ringtones. After two complaints, Bell Mobility stopped offering the tones. In 2005, Smith filed a complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Commission against Canadian music retailer HMV, criticizing the company for selling what Smith called \\"hate rap\\". Smith alleged that HMV was selling music that contained lyrics that were misogynistic. The Ontario Human Rights Tribunal recommended that Smith's case not be heard at a formal trial as the allegations were found not contrary to the Ontario Human Rights Code. Later in 2005, Smith attempted to prevent the 50 Cent biopic, Get Rich or Die Tryin', from receiving tax breaks for filming in Toronto. Smith argued that the film glorified gun violence and that it was unfair to use the money of tax payers, some of whom lived with gang violence, to fund a film that could incite violent behaviour. = Criticism of Eminem = In 2000, Smith wrote to the Hate Crimes Unit in Toronto claiming that Eminem \\"promotes hatred and advocates violence against women in his lyrics\\". Smith particularly took issue with the song \\"Kill You\\". The complaint was subsequently referred to the Attorney General of Ontario, Jim Flaherty, to see if the lyrics directly promoted violence in a way that contradicted Canada's criminal code. The Attorney General's office moved forward with motions to bar Eminem from performing his Toronto concert. Smith and Flaherty's criticisms did not keep Eminem from performing in October 2000 as the Toronto police did not find that the singer's lyrics met criteria warranting legal action. At the concert, Eminem dedicated his song \\"The Way I Am\\" to Smith, saying \\"I dedicate this next song to that bitch Valerie Smith.\\" though this remark did not bother Smith. After opening the concert with \\"Kill You\\", Eminem said to the crowd, \\"Bet you didn't think I was going to do that one, did you?\\".

He had a working vocabulary of over 600 signs in American Sign Language, taught to him by Koko, a female gorilla; Dr. Francine Patterson (to whom the gorillas referred using the sign \\"penny\\"); and other staff of Stanford University. Michael, an orphan, spent most of his life in Woodside, California, where he became a local celebrity and well-known painter, creating vividly colourful abstract works. Biography Michael was a gorilla whose parents were killed while he was still a baby. According to the movie Koko: Conversation with a Gorilla, his handlers felt that using sign language, he was attempting to relate his mother's death at the hands of poachers. At the age of three he was brought to live with Koko at Stanford. Michael's favorite color was yellow, and his favorite television shows were Sesame Street and Mister Rogers. He enjoyed listening to Luciano Pavarotti and looking at pictures. Michael also greatly enjoyed painting, and took it quite seriously, as opposed to Koko, who would paint for fun. Use of language Michael had a vocabulary of over 600 signs, some of which he learned from Koko. They both used 'stink' for 'flowers', and 'lip' for 'girl'. Because of the musculo- skeletal difference between apes and humans, the two gorillas employed a modified version of American Sign Language signs, adapted for their physical abilities. In sign language, deaf humans often create new signs by combining two or more signs, to express a concept for which they have no sign. Additionally, repetition and exaggeration of signs is used to create emphasis. Repetition, exaggeration and the creation of new signs by combining signs are techniques which are also used by simian 'signers'. Michael learned 20 words within his first year with The Gorilla Foundation. The following is an example of Michael's description of an event that is thought by humans at The Gorilla Foundation to be the death of his mother‚Äîkilled by bushmeat poachers when he was quite young: :\\"Squash meat gorilla. Mouth tooth. Cry sharp-noise loud. Bad think-trouble look-face. Cut/neck lip (girl) hole.\\"\\"KokoFLIX Videoblog Archive\\" 2015 THE GORILLA FOUNDATION / Koko.org, March 23, 2008. Michael seemed to behave akin to a small child. Michael described emotion, memories, and lies through sign language. Both Michael and Koko used the sign \\"fake\\" to describe a lie or to express doubt about the truth of a statement. Death Michael died of heart failure on April 19, 2000. Koko and her more recent potential mate, Ndume, mourned his passing for several months.

The law was enacted in 1976 by the 94th Congress and is found in the United States Code under Title 43. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act phased out homesteading in the United States by repealing the pre-existing Homestead Acts. Congress recognized the value of the public lands, declaring that these lands would remain in public ownership. The National Forest Service, National Park Service, and now, the Bureau of Land Management, are commissioned in FLPMA to allow a variety of uses on their land (of greater concern for the BLM, who is the least restrictive in terms of uses) while simultaneously trying to preserve the natural resources in them. This concept is best summarized by the term 'multiple-use.' 'Multiple use' is defined in the Act as \\"management of the public lands and their various resource values so that they are utilized in the combination that will best meet the present and future needs of the American people.\\" FLPMA addresses topics such as land-use planning, land acquisition, fees and payments, administration of federal land, range management, and right-of-ways on federal land. FLPMA has specific objectives and time frames in which to accomplish these objectives, giving it more authority and eliminating the uncertainty surrounding the BLM's role in wilderness designation and management. Parts of FLPMA relating specifically to Wilderness are found in Subchapter VI Designated Management Areas (¬ß¬ß 1781 to 1787) under 43 U.S. Code ¬ß 1782 - Bureau of Land Management Wilderness Study. Here, the BLM is also given a mandate to recommend areas for designation as Wilderness and are given 15 years to do so. The BLM is to conduct studies, classifying areas as 'Wilderness Study Areas.' These areas are not official Wilderness areas but are, for all intents and purposes, treated as such until formally designated as Wilderness or released by Congress. Approximately 8.8 million acres of BLM wilderness are currently included in the National Wilderness Preservation System as a result of the wilderness reviews mandated by FLPMA. Those ordered to implement policies from FLPMA are trained government employees using guidelines expressly stated within the act itself.

A leg- spinner, Shinde was described as \\"frail and willowy\\".Sujit Mukherjee, Playing for India, Orient Longman, 1988, pp. 217-219 Apart from the leg break and the conventional googly, Shinde could also bowl a different googly. According to Sujit Mukherjee, \\"coming after the orthodox wrist-crooked wrong-'un, this delivery invariably sprang a nasty surprise. Ripped off the top of the third finger, it hastened unexpectedly off the pitch. Its tendency to pitch short nullified its efficacy as secret weapon but was practically unplayable when properly pitched.\\" Shinde's first performance of note in first class cricket was a 5 for 186 that took in 75.5 overs for Maharashtra against Bombay in 1943-44 as Vijay Merchant made 359* for Bombay. He toured England with the Indian team in 1946 and took 39 wickets in tour matches. In his only appearance in a Test match, at Lord's, he was involved in a stand of 43 for the last wicket with Rusi Modi, but did little with the ball. In the next five years, he played in only one more Test. His one major success in Tests came against England at Delhi in 1951-52. He was brought on to bowl as the third change just before lunch on the first day of the series. Immediately after lunch he bowled Don Kenyon middle stump with a googly, and followed with Jack Robertson lbw and Donald Carr caught by wicket-keeper Nana Joshi off a leg- break. He was 8-2-16-3 at this point. He took three more wickets after tea as England were bowled out for 203 five minutes before close. Shinde's figures were 6/91. India took a handsome first innings lead and had two days to bowl England out in the second innings. But Shinde had seven chances missed off his bowling, most crucially by Joshi and the substitute Dattajirao Gaekwad, and England managed to save the match. Shinde himself missed a run out. Shinde found a place in the team to England in 1952 (possibly at the expense of Subhash Gupte). He took 39 more wickets in tour matches but the wicket of Peter May in Leeds was to be his last in Tests. Given a minimum of ten innings, Shinde is one of only two Test cricketers whose batting averages exceeded their highest score. The other was the Pakistani cricketer, Antao D'Souza. Shinde represented Maharashtra, Bombay and Baroda in Ranji Trophy and took 230 wickets in first class matches. He died of typhoid at the age of 32.Christopher Martin-Jenkins, The Complete Who's Who of Test Cricketers Shinde is the father-in-law of Sharad Pawar, the former President of BCCI.

History Hourglass corsets first became fashionable in the 1830s in Europe and the US. In contrast to Empire or late Georgian waistlines in which the \\"waist\\" lies just below the bust, Victorian fashion accentuated natural waistlines but further constricted them. The hourglass corset achieved immediate waist reduction, as it acted mainly on a short zone around the waist. Rather than attempting to slim the torso around the ribs, tissue could be compressed and redistributed above and below the waistline. The hourglass became the iconic corset shape. They are featured in the media; often the image of the corset shown is of a \\"woman clutching a bedpost while their maid pulls and pulls at the corset strings\\". The hourglass corset accentuated slim waists and broadened the bust, shoulders and hips. These elements worked in tandem with very wide skirts, large sleeves, and sloping shoulders to create the wide-slim-wide hourglass figure. Hourglass silhouettes remained popular throughout the 19th century, though outerwear styles evolved. In England, France, and America these corsets were mainly worn by aristocrats and in some cases royalty. As skirts and sleeves shrank, Edwardian era fashions began to favor a more slender, vertical look. Princess line dresses were popular in the 1880s. These were made without a horizontal waist seam and with long vertical seams running the length of the dress, with the dress closely fitted to the body. Hourglass corsets evolved to emphasize the vertical lines of the body, and attempted to slim the torso above the waist as well. Variations Initially hourglass corsets were not laced as tightly as the straight-fronted corsets fashionable at the beginning of the twentieth century. Corsets were still the norm, but they no longer had the exaggerated wide-narrow-wide silhouette of the hourglass shape. Straight- fronted corsets are one of the most common styles of corset made today, and may be used for post-pregnancy waist training. = Pipe-stem waist = Pipe- stem waist A pipe-stem waist is a silhouette given by wearing a certain kind of corset. The corset is designed so that the circumference of the waist is compressed for a distance above the natural waistline. These were never common, as the added pressure on the rib cage as ribs are pressed inwards can be uncomfortable. Reports of nineteenth century pipe-stem waists on corsets often cite a height of up to 15 cm (6 inches). Devotees of this silhouette trained their figures for many years and only a few public examples exist. Usually this figure is adopted for erotic purposes or as part of the body modification movement. Criticisms Victorian illustration of the natural vs. the corseted body. Corsets were criticized as detrimental to the wearer's health. While they have been praised as a device for improving posture, many health care professionals advise against the use of constrictive garments for extended periods. The shape of the rib cage could be altered by tightly laced corsets. Also, tightly laced corsets can irritate skin, reduce lung capacity, and weaken muscles that support the back and the chest. Some of the long-term effects that are thought to be caused by tight-corset wearing include reduced pelvis size, constipation and digestive issues, and reproductive problems ranging from miscarriage to uterine prolapse.

Description  The collared whitestart is around in length with a weight of . It has a chestnut crown bordered with black, and a black forehead. The rest of the upper parts are slaty black, and the tail is black with white edges, hence the bird's name: \\"start\\" is an old English word for \\"tail\\". The face and underparts are bright yellow, with a black band across the breast. The sexes are similar, but young birds are duller, with a browner back, weakly yellow underparts, and the head entirely slate-coloured, with no yellow on the face or red on the crown.  Behaviour  The call is a sharp pit, and the song is a mixture of slurred whistles, warbles and trills. The collared whitestart feeds on insects, frequently fanning its striking tail as it pursues its prey. It will join mixed feeding flocks, and will follow cattle and occasionally humans for the insects they flush. The roofed nest has a round side entrance and is built on the ground or a steep bank, hidden amongst rocks, tufts of grass or under a fallen log. It is constructed from strips of bark, plant fibres, leaves, and grass. From March to May, the female will lay 2 or 3 white or cream eggs that are speckled with fine brown spots. Incubation lasts about two weeks, but other nesting details are largely unknown.  Habitat  The collared whitestart is common at heights between 1500 m and the timberline in mossy mountain forests, ravines, second growth, and adjacent pastures.

Peraza played congas, bongos, and timbales. Biography=Early life = Born in Lawton Batista, Havana, Cuba in 1924 (although the birth year is uncertain), he was orphaned by age 7 and lived on the streets. When he was twelve, he supported himself by selling vegetables, coaching boxing, playing semi-pro baseball, and becoming a loan shark. His music career began at seventeen when he heard at a baseball game that bandleader Alberto Ruiz was looking for a conga player. Ruiz's brother was on the same baseball team as Peraza. Despite the absence of experience in music, he practiced and won the audition. =Moving to New York= He left Cuba for Mexico in 1948 to tend to his sick friend, conga drummer Mongo Santamar√≠a. They arrived in New York City in 1949. After playing in Machito's big band, Peraza was invited by Charlie Parker to participate in a recording session that included Buddy Rich. He recorded with Slim Gaillard in New York in November 1949 in a session that produced \\"Bongo City\\". He toured the U.S. with Gaillard's band until they reached San Francisco, where Gaillard owned the nightclub Bop City. After a period in Mexico, where he recorded with Perez Prado and did some soundtracks for the Mexican movie industry, he returned to the U.S. and settled in San Francisco. While on the West Coast, he worked with Dizzy Gillespie, toured extensively with Charles Mingus and Dexter Gordon, and played in California for Mexican farm workers with Puerto Rican actor and musician Tony Martinez (who played \\"Pepino\\" on the TV show The Real McCoys). Armando also led an Afro-Cuban dance review at the Cable Car Village club in San Francisco, attracting a clientele from Hollywood that included Errol Flynn, Marlon Brando, and Rita Hayworth. =Working with Shearing and Tjader= In 1954, while in San Francisco with pianist Dave Brubeck, Peraza met Cal Tjader, Brubeck's drummer at the time. Jazz critic Leonard Feather recommended Peraza to Fantasy Records to record an Afro-Cuban album with Tjader. The result was Ritmo Caliente, which combined Afro-Cuban rhythms with a jazz sensibility. He was introduced to British pianist George Shearing by bassist Al McKibbon. He spent the next twelve years with Shearing, a collaboration that put Peraza at the front of Afro-Cuban music. He emerged as a composer, writing and recording twenty-one songs for Shearing, such as \\"Mambo in Chimes\\", \\"Mambo in Miami\\", \\"Ritmo Africano\\", \\"Armando's Hideaway\\", \\"This is Africa\\", and \\"Estampa Cubana\\". These recordings were during the mambo craze in the U.S. and the world. Peraza's technique and power as a hand drummer became a feature of Shearing's performances. He toured all over the world with Shearing, but it was in America that he experienced persistent and institutionalized racism. In Miami during dates with Shearing and Peggy Lee in 1959, Peraza and black members of the band were prohibited from staying at the same hotel as the white musicians. Shearing and Lee resolved the situation by threatening to quit the performance unless Peraza and the others were allowed to stay at their hotel. Shearing's was one of the first racially integrated jazz groups. While with Shearing, Peraza had opportunity to play with the classical symphonies of Boston, Philadelphia, New York, and Oklahoma City. In 1959, Peraza joined Mongo Santamar√≠a for the Mongo album with conga drummer Francisco Aguabella, another contemporary and friend of Peraza. \\"Afro-Blue\\" became a jazz standard after John Coltrane recorded it. The album combined with Yambo in the compilation Afro Roots in 1972.Liner notes of Mongo Santamaria CD Afro Roots by Pestige Records, 1989, PCD-24018-2 In the 1960s, Peraza was a member of Cal Tjader's band for six years. He was encouraged to perform and record in southern California by jazz drummer Shelly Manne. Peraza performed throughout the area at such venues as Shelly's Manne-Hole (owned Manne) and The Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach. A highlight was performing with the Stan Kenton Band at the Hollywood Bowl. Through his friendship with Manne, he was introduced to Judy Garland, who hired Peraza to play in her orchestra for The Judy Garland Show, a television series that ran from 1963 to 1964. In the fall of 1964, he recorded the album Soul Sauce with Tjader. The single \\"Guachi Guaro\\" won a Grammy Award in 1965. Although Peraza preferred being a featured performer to leading, he did record one solo album, Wild Thing (1968), for Skye, a label owned by Tjader, Gary McFarland, and G√°bor Szab√≥. The album featured performances by pianist Chick Corea, saxophonist Sadao Watanabe, and flautist Johnny Pacheco. When rock music became popular in the 1960s, Peraza was the first Afro-Cuban percussionist to add conga drums to a rock track, notably on Harvey Mandel's Cristo Redentor album in 1968. =Joining Santana= Armando Peraza in London, 1999 In January 1972, at the age of 47, Peraza joined the rock band Santana and influenced the band in melding Afro-Cuban, jazz, rock, and blues. Peraza remained with Carlos Santana for nearly twenty years and played to millions of people around the world, partnering with percussionists Jos√© Areas, Mingo Lewis, Raul Rekow, and Orestes Vilat√≥. He wrote or co-wrote sixteen songs recorded by Santana, such as \\"Gitano\\" from the album Amigos (1976) for which Peraza sang the lyrics. Peraza retired from Santana in 1990 at the age of 66, although traveled to Santiago de Chile for a 1992 concert with Santana in front of a crowd of over 100,000 people. In 2005 he appeared on a recording by John Santos, 20th Anniversary, which included \\"El Chang√º√≠ de Peraza\\" with Peraza on bongos. In 2002, he returned to his native Cuba, his first trip there in over fifty years. In July 2006, Peraza, at 82 years of age, made a rare appearance with Santana for a three show performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. This was the first of a number of summer live appearances. Later he appeared at the San Jos√© Jazz Festival in California with the Julius Melendez Latin Jazz Ensemble. He taught drum clinics in California with Raul Rekow and Karl Perazzo, both members of Santana. He recorded with pianist Rebeca Mauleon on Descarga en California (Universal/Pimienta) and co-wrote a song on Cepeda Forever in honor of his friend, baseball player Orlando Cepeda. In 2007, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Voices of Latin Rock. The tribute show was held at Bimbo's nightclub in San Francisco and was attended by Carlos Santana, who presented Peraza with an award. Also attending and performing were members of the band Malo and a reunion of the original Santana band with Jos√© Areas, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie, and Michael Shrieve. Every January, the Voices of Latin Rock present the Armando Peraza Award for achievement in the San Francisco Bay Area. Peraza died of pneumonia on April 14, 2014 at the age of 89.

He was born in an eminent business family, to Amiya Sen and Basanti Sen. Probir Sen, known as \\"Khokhan\\", was the first Bengali to represent India in Test matches, and the first Bengali to keep wickets for India. His agility behind the stumps was beyond doubt, with 20 catches and 11 stumpings. Sen played his first first-class cricket game representing Bengal in 1943, when he was only 17 years old and just out of school at La Martiniere, Calcutta. A stocky right- handed wicketkeeper-batsman, Sen first toured with the Indian team in 1947‚Äì48 in Australia where he was to act as the reserve keeper to Jenni Irani. After impressing in the first-class fixtures he came into the side for the Third Test to make his Test debut at Melbourne on New Year's Day 1948. In the Fifth Test, also in Melbourne, he took four catches. Despite Australia making 575 runs he only conceded four byes. He was the only Indian wicket-keeper to stump Don Bradman, which he did in a four-day match against South Australia in 1947‚Äì48. When the West Indies toured India in 1948‚Äì49 he played his first home Test series and played in all five Tests. His finest moment was in the final Test against England at Madras in 1951‚Äì52. Sen played a notable part in the historic victory, taking five stumpings, all off Vinoo Mankad, including four in the first innings to help his side to a famous win. After a tour of England in 1952 and a couple of Tests against the touring Pakistan team in 1952‚Äì53 he lost his place in the side. With the bat Sen was a handy lower-order batsman, although he never made a Test half-century. Also an occasional bowler, during a Ranji Trophy game in 1954‚Äì55 against Orissa he took a hat-trick. Only two wicket-keepers have removed their pads and taken hat-tricks in first-class cricket: Probir Sen for Bengal against Orissa at Cuttack in 1954‚Äì55 and Alan Smith for Warwickshire against Essex at Clacton in 1965. He finished his Ranji Trophy career with 1796 runs at 30.44. Sen died in 1970 after playing a game of cricket at Calcutta. He had suffered a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Reena Sen (whom he married in 1948, and who is the niece of the late Pankaj Gupta), his daughter Madhusree Dhar, his grandchildren Bikram, Debaki, and Aditi Dhar, and his son Abhijit Sen. His brother Ranabir Sen, a stylish left-handed batsman, played first-class cricket for Bengal. In Sen's memory the cricket tourney trophy, the P. Sen Memorial Trophy, is played in Kolkata every year, with top Indian and international players participating.

MRes, MARes, MScRes, or MScR) degree is an internationally recognised advanced postgraduate research degree. In most cases, the degree is designed to prepare students for doctoral research. Increasingly, the degree may be useful for students considering careers outside of academia, where high-level research skills are valued but a doctoral qualification is not required. A Master of Research may be recommended where a student is unsure if they would like to pursue a doctoral program, or if they do not have the qualifications or experience to gain direct entry into a doctoral program. It can provide a useful experience of what doctoral study is like, whilst also allowing the student to acquire a Master's level qualification. In some cases it's also considered a foundation for conducting research in professional contexts. For disciplines that undertake practice-led research, a Master of Research provides an opportunity for understanding the nature and potential of research study through, for example, art and design practice. The Master of Research may be especially appealing to those in the field of Medicine who wish to develop academic research skills to enter competitive specialities such as surgery or public health. At some universities, the degree is conferred in a specific discipline, for example, a Master of Research (Science) or a Master of Science by Research.  United Kingdom  Master of Research degrees are increasingly popular with a number of the Russell Group Universities; such as University of Glasgow, University of Edinburgh, Cardiff University, University College London, Imperial College London, University of Bristol, University of Manchester, Newcastle University, University of Liverpool, University of Southampton, University of York and the University of London; as well as in universities with significant art and design departments, such as the Faculty of Arts (University of Brighton), University of the Arts London, and the Royal College of Art. In most cases, the degree is designed to prepare students for doctoral research.http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/International_students/Step_by_step_guide/Understanding_the_UK_higher_education_system/p!epmleci For universities with significant strengths in Practice-led research, a research master's degree preparation provides an opportunity for understanding the nature and potential of research study through, for example, art and design practice. = Programme structure = Research master's degree programmes are different from taught master's degrees by placing particular emphasis on a large dissertation (typically between 35-40,000 words), or an equivalent practice-led research project, in addition to fewer (or no) taught modules. Research master's degrees programmes courses in the UK must guarantee that at least 70% of the content is project based as it is \\"geared to those wishing to pursue a research career afterwards.\\"http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/About_postgrad_study/taught_courses/p!edcbgbp This will often include training in Research Methods, as well as instruction in Research Ethics and professional practice issues such as writing proposals, making funding applications and publishing. = Award instead of doctoral degree = Some universities may award this degree to a doctoral candidate who has not completed the required period of study for a doctorate, but has completed a sufficient dissertation and taught content to be acceptable for an MRes. In most cases, however, a PhD candidate will step down to the level of a Master of Philosophy at British universities. The main difference between an MRes and an MPhil is that MRes sometimes (but not always) has taught components (although the main focus is still on research) and therefore might require a first year taught component during the doctoral studies. Research undertaken for a Master of Research degree is typically shorter in duration to that of an MPhil or PhD - around one year, as opposed to two or three, full- time. For humanities subjects, MPhil theses are typically 60,000 words (and PhDs 80-100,000), while MRes or MA(Res) are usually around 35-40,000 by thesis, or lesser for courses with a taught component (a mixture of smaller essays and a dissertation). Some universitieshttp://www.abdn.ac.uk/clsm/graduate/current- students/progmon/ninemonth/oral-examination/ require an oral exam (viva voce) in addition to a written thesis for successful completion of an MRes degree.  Australia  In Australia, a Master of Research is a postgraduate level research training degree. The program consists of a coursework component and a supervised research project, including a thesis of 20-25,000 words. An MRes is completed within two years, or part-time equivalent. The degree is currently only offered at a limited number of universities, having first being introduced at Macquarie University.http://www.mq.edu.au/research/phd-and- research-degrees/research-training The University of Technology Sydney offers a Master of Research in specific disciplines through its faculties. The university also offers trans-disciplinary research through entities such as Master of Sustainable Futures (Research) provided by the Institute for Sustainable Futures. A Master of Research may be undertaken as a pathway qualification to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), or as training to provide professional research skills.

Korn Spruit) was an engagement fought during the Second Boer War (1899-1902) between the British Empire and the Boers of the two independent republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. Background In early 1900, the British army, in overwhelming strength, had occupied Bloemfontein, capital of the Orange Free State, and were preparing to drive north to Pretoria, capital of the Transvaal. Field Marshal Lord Roberts, commander in chief of the British forces, believed that with the capture of the capitals of both republics, the war would be all but over. While the Burghers of the South African Republic prepared to defend their capital, with little prospect of success, the Free State Boers, inspired by President Martinus Steyn, the spiritual heart of the Boer resistance, and Christiaan de Wet, their foremost field general, regrouped and prepared to continue the conflict through unconventional means. Their action at Sanna‚Äôs Post was the first large-scale use of guerrilla tactics in this conflict. On 30 March 1900 a 2,000-man Boer force led by Christiaan De Wet advanced in the direction of Bloemfontein. Reconnaissance indicated the presence of a small garrison of British troops at Sanna‚Äôs Post, 23 miles east of Bloemfontein, which held Bloemfontein's water works. A British mounted force under Brigadier General Robert George Broadwood which had earlier attacked other Boer positions at Thaba 'Nchu, was withdrawing there. Broadwood's force consisted of Q and U Batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery, a composite regiment of the Life Guards, the 10th Hussars, the Royal Irish Regiment, the New Zealand and Burma Mounted Infantry, and Roberts's Horse and Rimington's Guides (which were light horse units raised from English-speaking South Africans). De Wet sent 1600 of his men under his brother Piet to attack Broadwood from the north, while he himself occupied Sanna's Post to intercept their retreat. The action During the darkness De Wet infiltrated a force of riflemen into the ravine created by the Modder River, setting the kill zone of the ambush. At first light on 31 March, Piet de Wet's artillery opened fire from a set of small hills to the north as the British troops were striking camp for the morning. Tactical surprise was complete and all were sent into a state of confusion. The British force began to retreat as expected, in the direction of the ravine where the blocking force awaited with orders from De Wet to hold their fire. The civilian wagon drivers preceding the soldiers were seized by the Boers and told if they warned the British they would be shot. Therefore, the British soldiers suspected nothing and approached the river in small groups. As they did so De Wet‚Äôs troops ordered them to surrender, and approximately two hundred were captured, along with the six guns of U Battery. An alert British officer noticed what was happening and ordered Q Battery to gallop away. De Wet's men then opened fire. The British fell back on a railway station which offered substantial cover, while Q Battery under Major Phipps-Hornby (joined by one gun from U Battery whose team managed to break away from de Wet) deployed in the open and opened fire. This fire, combined with accurate rifle fire from the railway station, pinned down Christiaan de Wet's men, but Piet de Wet's forces were increasing their pressure. Broadwood's ammunition was running out, and he decided to retire to the south. His guns had first to be recovered. Five were hooked up and towed away, but two had to be abandoned. Many British soldiers were killed crossing the 1300 yards of open ground to retrieve the guns, but unit integrity was maintained. Eventually, Broadwood managed to break contact. Approximately three hours later the 9th Infantry Division commanded by Major General Sir Henry Colville arrived to relieve the mounted brigade, but de Wet‚Äôs men had withdrawn to highly defensible positions across the Modder River and both sides retired from the field. This nevertheless left Bloemfontein's water works in Boer hands. In all, the British suffered 155 men killed or wounded. 428 men, seven field artillery pieces and 117 wagons were captured. The Boer force suffered three killed and five wounded. But even more serious than the losses in the action was the loss of Bloemfontein's water supplies. This greatly aggravated an epidemic of enteric fever dysentery and cholera among the occupying British army, which eventually caused 2000 deaths. Aftermath Private H. L. Reece of the 1st Contingent of the Queensland Mounted Infantry was killed in the Battle of Sanna's Post In recognition of the conspicuous gallantry displayed by all ranks of Q Battery on this occasion, Field Marshal Lord Roberts decided to treat the case as one of collective gallantry, under the Rule 13 of the Victoria Cross Warrant. Accordingly, direction was given that one of the officers should be chosen by the other officers, one noncommissioned officer by the noncommissioned officers and two gunners or drivers by the gunners and drivers for the award of the Victoria Cross. The men from Q Battery awarded the Victoria Cross were: Major Edmund Phipps-Hornby, Sergeant Charles E. H. Parker, Gunner Isaac Lodge, and Driver Horace Henry Glasock. Q Battery was officially granted the Honour Title \\"Sanna's Post\\" on 18 October 1926 in commemoration of this action. As of 2015, it continues to serve as Q (Sanna's Post) Battery in 5th Regiment Royal Artillery. Field Marshal Lord Roberts also awarded the Victoria Cross to Lieutenant Francis Aylmer Maxwell who voluntarily made five incursions into open terrain under heavy rifle fire to recover two guns and three limbers, one of which was dragged back by hand by himself, another officer and some gunners. Lieutenant Maxwell also attempted to save a third gun from capture, remaining with it until the proximity of the enemy made further efforts impossible.

History Construction on the $3.25 million campus-style facility began in August 1958, with 13 buildings spread out over of the property to accommodate 600 students from Mahwah and Allendale. Delays in starting the work meant that the initial set of classrooms would not be available until November 1958, with completion of the 1,200-student capacity facility due for February 1959. Before the buildings opened, the district rented space from Ramsey High School, with Allendale and Mahwah students who had already started in the Ramsey district remaining there until graduation. With the opening of the high school, the Mahwah district's elementary schools were changed from K-8 to K-6, with the new high school serving students in grades 7-12.\\"Mahwah Building A Campus School; 13 Buildings of Junior-Senior High Will Occupy Only 20 of Site's 62 Acres\\", The New York Times, August 3, 1958.

Tarapore played as the understudy to Vinoo Mankad, the first of the three or four such left arm spinners, against West Indies in 1948-49. His short international career was thus described by Sujit Mukherjee: :The earliest experiment - a hapless guinea-pig - was greyed Keki Tarapore who was thrust into whirling West Indian blades in the Delhi Test of 1948. Only three wickets fell to Indian bowlers on each of the first two days and Tarapore was conspicuously innocent of them all; so the mammoth crowd diverted itself by tormenting the poor man who at thirty eight (his first class career dated back to the (first) Pentangular), was not the most agile man in the field. While fielding at deep extra cover on the second day in this match, Tarapore injured his fingers while trying to stop a four hit by Robert Christiani off Vinoo Mankad. He had to leave the field, and when he came back, the crowd barracked him every time he touched the ball. Indian Express, 12 November 1948 Four months after his only Test, Tarapore played his last first class match - the Ranji final between Bombay and Baroda - where he bowled 99 overs. Tarapore later went into cricket administration. He managed the Indian teams to England in 1967 and West Indies in 1970-71. He served as the secretary of Cricket Club of India from 1954 to 1982. He died after being knocked down by a moped. Notes *There are two Keki Tarapores in Indian cricket. The other Tarapore (1922‚Äì2001) was better known as a coach. He was based in Bangalore and mentored many Karnataka juniors some of whom went on to play for India.

In 1922, the diocese was again divided, with the southern portion becoming the Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego. The current diocese was created as a result of the division of the Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego. The Diocese of San Diego was established on July 11, 1936, at which time it included San Diego County, Imperial County, Riverside County, and San Bernardino County; the remainder of the former diocese then became the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. In 1978, the Diocese of San Diego was itself divided, with Riverside County and San Bernardino County becoming the Diocese of San Bernardino. Currently, the Diocese of San Diego includes 99 parishes and 16 missions, serving San Diego County and Imperial County. In addition, the diocese includes 45 elementary schools, 5 high schools and 2 universities (University of San Diego and John Paul the Great Catholic University). = Clergy sexual abuse cases= On February 28, 2007, the diocese filed for bankruptcy protection after the diocese was unable to reach a settlement agreement with numerous plaintiffs suing over sexual abuse by clergy. On September 7, 2007, the diocese agreed to pay $198.1 million to settle 144 claims of child sexual abuse by clergy, the 2nd-largest settlement payment by a Roman Catholic diocese in U.S. history. Perpetrators included 48 priests and one lay coordinator of altar boys. In September 2018, eight more priests were added to this list. On December 17, 2018, Juan Garcia Castillo, who served as a priest at St. Patrick Parish in Carlsbad, was convicted of sexual battery for inappropriately touching a seminarian of his age and buying him alcohol at a local BJ's restaurants in Carlsbad, California, where he and the seminarian, together with another seminarian were having dinner. On December 11, 2019, it was announced that four victims of convicted, and now deceased, sexual abuser Anthony Edward Rodrigue will sue the Diocese of San Diego. Their lawsuit will begin on January 2, 2020.

However a radical change occurred during the past decades. It is the introduction of the English legal system into the country; a result of the Maldivian society coming in close contact with the outside world. Consequently, the present legal system of the country is an admixture of not only Shari‚Äôah and customs, but the English legal system also. Pre-Islamic history The early and medieval history of the Maldives was ignored until recent times. There are few works on the early history of the country and they are also not completely reliable due to lack of historical evidence and immense references to folklore. However, we may safely assume that like other countries of the world, the Maldives also should have had a judicial system from the earliest times of her existence as a state. The judicial system which took a new direction after the country embraced Islam in 1153 A.C. is an heir of the previous system which had evolved centuries ago. According to Allama Ahmed Shihabuddine of Addu Meedhoo, the son of Addu Bodu Fandiyaaru Thakurufaanu, the first inhabitants of the Maldives, the dheyvi‚Äôs, came here around 4th century B.C. and had a leader whom they called ‚ÄòSawamia‚Äô. The Sawamia was the religious leader of these people. They thought that this Sawamia was an agent of God and hence, in their social organisation he had absolute power of life and death over the people. He was the authority on their affairs. All disputes and conflicts, whether between two government officials, or a government official and a common person, or between two common people, were decided by the Sawamia.4 When we take the above accounts into considerations we know that from the earliest times the people living in the Maldives had a system which was functioning as a judicial body. In this system, the judge was the leader or the Sawamia and the court might have been the leader‚Äôs official residence. It may be assumed that the society would have been governed on the basis of some prevailing customs and traditions. According to Isdhoo Loamaafaanu, a historical document of the Maldives written in 1195 A.C., there was a set of customs implemented as law in the country when Islam came in 1153 A.C. This set of customs was known as ‚Äòpoorube roodin‚Äô.5 From this report also we can deduce that a system of laws was evolved from the very beginning of the Maldivian society. Within a century after the colonization of the Maldives by the Dheyvis, another wave of travelers came from India and started to occupy the country with the former. The merger of these two people lead to a development of a new society and finally gave rise to an authoritative monarchy. That is the time when the dictations of the King started to absolute; the main source of law in the country. Islamic history Islam became the official religion of the state of the Maldives with the conversion of King Theemuge Mahaakalaminjaa into the imported faith in 1153 A.D. As mentioned before the earliest documentary evidence of the Maldivian history of this period is the Isdhoo Loamaafaanu. This document refers to a ‚Äòpadiyaaru‚Äô and an ‚Äòuthu padiyaaru‚Äô.7 It can be easily concluded that the present noun given to a judge in the Dhivehi language, ‚Äòfandiyaaru‚Äô is an evolved version of ‚Äòpadiyaaru. It can also be argued that the Dhivehi noun for Supreme Judge, ‚Äòuththama fandiyaaru‚Äô is a developed version of ‚Äòuthu padiyaaru.‚Äô The ‚Äòpadiyaaru‚Äô, the judge, was an esteemed and respected leader of the society. This can be understood from the references in the Isdhoo Loamaafaanu. ‚ÄòHandhaanaai Thaareekhah Takai Dhivehi Raajje‚Äô has the following words to say, ‚Äúthe nobles listed as testifiers in the Isdhoo Loamaafaanu were people of high caste in the society.8 The powerfulness of the judges can be understood from an incident recorded in the Isdhoo Loamaafaanu. According to this report the judges issued orders for some Buddhist monks of Isdhoo to be brought to Male‚Äô and beheaded. The orders also included a commandment to demolish a monastery in the same island. According to the report these orders were executed as directed by the judges. The reports in the Isdhoo Loamaafaanu also indicate that the judges did not meddle with other political affairs of the state.9 This fact does not mean that the judiciary was an independent institution in the political organization of the Maldives. But the institution involved in the administration of justice was a completely specialized institution, with the judges concerned only about their task as judicial officials. The same document also refers to an official called ‚Äòdhandanaayaka‚Äô who was responsible for ‚Äúimplementing and executing the judgments and decisions of the judges.‚Äù The above references show that during the first century of the Islamic era of the Maldives, there were judges who were specialized in administering justice and that there were special officials who were responsible for implementing the judgments of them. The judiciary of the Maldives was a separate institution in the political organization of the country. As aforementioned, according to the Isdhoo Loamaafaanu, a set of customs called ‚Äòpoorube roodin‚Äô was implemented as law in the country before the coming of Islam. From the same source and later historical records it is clear that after Islam the Islamic Shari‚Äôah gradually became the main source of laws in the country. However, many years after Islam, the ‚Äòpoorube roodin‚Äô still played an important part in the judicial system. Historical sources also say that the king was himself an authority. His decrees were treated as law and were implemented through the judicial system. During the first century after Islam the judiciary, therefore, underwent a radical change, with a completely alien system of law being introduced. The years which followed saw the operation of three main sources of law in the country, namely, the Islamic Shari‚Äôah, the decrees of the King and customs. Since Islamic Shari‚Äôah was introduced gradually, it caused the rules of Shari‚Äôah to be altered by local customs. The Islamic Shari‚Äôah was never implemented in the country in its complete and pure form. One example is in the dress code of the Maldivian women. Although the Shari‚Äôah has specific commandments on this matter, accounts of Historians like Ibn Batuta, and Fran√ßois Pyrard show that these commandments were not implemented in medieval times. As for the duties of the judges, they were required to be thorough with both the Shari‚Äôah laws and also the ‚Äòpoorube roodin.‚Äô ‚ÄúTherefore,...the judge in the country was a scholar of not only Islamic law. He was also well versed in the customs and traditions of the Maldivian society.‚Äù While writing about the history of the Maldives during the period of Ninth-Twelfth centuries, H. C. P. Bell quotes from the famous Arab traveler-geologist Al Idrisi (1099‚Äì1186), ‚ÄúHis (the King's) wife administers justice‚Ä¶‚Äù Was the queen the highest authority of administering justice from the beginning of political organization? After Islam did the queen rise to that position in the political arena of the country? Did that particular queen have an extraordinary influence on the administration of the state? There is not enough evidence to make a conclusion on this point. What is known is that no mention is made of a queen being the highest authority in administering justice in the country in any other document or in folk evidence. The great traveler Abu Abdullah Muhammad, commonly called ‚ÄòIbn Batuta‚Äô, visited the Maldives in 1343 A.C. In his records he writes as follows: ‚ÄúThey call the judge by the name of ‚Äòfandiyaaru kaloa.‚Äù They go to the ‚Äòfandiyaaru kaloa‚Äô to settle all their disputes. He is the most highly esteemed and respected person among them. His orders were like the decrees of the King himself, or even stronger. He sits on a special carpet in the palace while hearing cases. He would own three islands, and the income generated by these islands would be his income.‚Äù From the above quotation it can be understood how powerful the judge was in the political organisation of the country. This conclusion is further strengthened by the following statements: ‚ÄúWhen I married this lady (the daughter of Suleimaan Meynaa Wazeer), the Wazeer forced me to become the Judge. ‚Ä¶ There are no(t as) many big conflicts in this country as we have in our lands. The first evil custom which I abolished as a judge was the custom of women remaining with their husbands after they had been divorced. ‚Ä¶ I completely uprooted this custom.‚Äù Besides this account, Ibn Batuta also tells us about certain unislamic customs that he abolished by issuing rulings. We can assume that these judicial rulings should have been implemented by the ‚Äòdhandanaayaka‚Äô or some other officials who were in charge of implementing such rulings. Ibn Batuta had written reports about the procedure of trial also. ‚ÄúIf two people are to be brought before the judge, they would be ordered to do so in writing. When this order was issued the parties should present themselves before the judge as directed. If anyone failed to do so, he would be duly punished.‚Äù Ibn Batuta further says that if a person did not want to, or could not be present before the judge, he could send someone to represent him. If the defendant was able to use a representative to speak on his behalf, it possbily means that the practice of lawyers representing their clients was there in the Maldives during those days in some form. According to Ibn Batuta, when the King felt that a case was to be reconsidered (perhaps on appeal) then the case would be tried again in the presence of the King and three ‚Äòbodu beykalun‚Äô, by the Uthu Fandiyaaru (perhaps the Supreme Judge) and a ‚ÄòBodu Naaibu‚Äô or a Qaadhi. This report makes it clear that there was a kind of an appeal system also. The main points of note from the accounts of Ibn Batuta: #The judge was independent to issue verdicts of disputes as he deemed fit, and the only authority that could challenge his decision was the king. #The procedure involved in hearings was systematic. #The parties involved in a conflict might use a representative to speak before the judge on behalf of him. #A case might be appealed in some situations. The judicial system of the Maldives was developing and evolving. It may be incorrect to say that the system was a highly efficient system during this time. But then, the reason was that the Maldivian society was lacking a proper education system and an efficient social structure. Also, the fact that the population was divided between a number of islands, with each island having a group of few hundred people was a significant factor. As a proverb says, necessity is the mother of invention, and there was never a necessity for a highly complex and comprehensive judicial system to evolve. Some people may argue that the political supremacy of the monarchy also prevented a judicial system to developing into a highly efficient and independent political body. Fran√ßois Pyrard, another foreign writer who has given considerable accounts of the Maldivian judiciary came to the country in 1602 A.C., about four centuries after Ibn Batuta. Unlike Ibn Batuta, Pyrard shed light on the judicial operations in the atolls also. He says that ‚Äúeach atoll is a separate province. The person in charge of each atoll is called a ‚ÄòBodu Naa‚Äôibu‚Äô. These Bodu Naa‚Äôibs are the leaders of the provinces. He is responsible for implementing the religious laws. He has an obligation to manage the education system as well as the legal affairs. And he is over the other Naa‚Äôibs in the province. ‚ÄúSince the Naa‚Äôib is the absolute dictator over his province, he is responsible for deciding both criminal and civil matters. If someone wants to file a case he has to meet the Naa‚Äôib.‚Äù The following paragraph may be a very comprehensive description of the hierarchy of the Maldivian judiciary during the time of Pyrard. He says; ‚ÄúThere are no judges in the Maldives. Except for Male, the laws and religious hukm are implemented in the islands by the aforementioned 13 Naa‚Äôibs, Katheeb (a chief who run the administrative affairs of each island) and Mudims (Imams who are managing the mosques). There is a leader who is above these officials in Male. This person would always be someone very close to the King. He is known as ‚Äòfandiyaaraa.‚Äô He is the royal judge. If a person is not happy with a decision made by a Naa‚Äôib in an atoll, he has the right to appeal to the fandiyaaru in Male‚Äô. It is the same in both civil and criminal cases. The fandiyaaru would seek the consultation of the Naa‚Äôibs when deciding the case. ‚Ä¶ a person may appeal to the King also, if he is not satisfied with the decision of the fandiyaaru. Such cases would be considered by the ‚Äòha beykalun‚Äô (six nobles who are regarded as the closest advisors of the King‚Äù). So when Pyrard came to the Maldives, the judicial system was operative throughout the country as a coordinated and unified system. Pyrard says that there were no judges in the Maldives. But obviously he is mistaken on this point. Even though the Naa‚Äôibs in the atolls were not judges, the fandiyaaru was a judge. The difference between a judge and a fandiyaaru is only of name. His reasoning may be that the Naa‚Äôibs who carried out the functions of administering justice was also the executive heads of the atolls. The account clearly says that in the judicial system of the country, there was a hierarchy of which the topmost official was the fandiyaaru. Under his authority were the Naa‚Äôibs and other officials who implemented the judgments of the judiciary. Pyrard also speaks about the procedure involved in trying a case. ‚Äúthey call a complain(t) ‚Äòsakuvaa‚Äô. The hearing would be held at the residence of the Naa‚Äôib in the atolls, and in the residence of the fandiyaaru, if it is in Male‚Äô. And sometimes important cases might be tried in the King‚Äôs palace also. If someone wants to file a case, he should speak to the Naa‚Äôib. Then the Naa‚Äôib would send his dheyvaani (an official who executes the decisions of the Naa‚Äôib) to bring the defendant. If the defendant is not present in the island, then the order would be forwarded to the Bodu Naa‚Äôib of the atoll. If the defendant is not present in the atoll, then matter is out of the Naa‚Äôib‚Äôs power and the fandiyaaru has to intervene. The fandiyaaru has the power to order the summoning of any person in any area of the country.‚Äù Pyrard also has the following statements to make; ‚Äúif one of the parties involved in a case is not satisfied with the fandiyaaru who decided the case, he may appeal to the King. The King would, then, appoint new judges to reconsider the case all over again.‚Äù About the supreme authority of justice in the country, Pyrard says: ‚Äúthe people who know the laws in that country are the judges. Administering justice is a duty on them. However, the Supreme Judge, who is above them all, is the King himself. He is the person who orders for the implementation of judgments. The king, therefore, has the power of life and death over the people. Appeals are made to the king. If he decides that a particular case is to be reconsidered, he may order that to be done to a judge or a religious scholar or any other royal official. Generally speaking, the king has the power to make decisions in all affairs, as he wishes, without consulting anybody. So he conducts the affairs of the country as he deems fit. Sometimes he appears in the form of an inhuman despot, and that is normally in cases where a hardcore criminal from a poor family is concerned.‚Äù In 1834 A.C. Lieutenant W. Christopher wrote about the judicial system of the Maldives. ‚ÄúFandiyaaraa is the highest authority after the King. He is the most highly esteemed and respected person among the public. He has two main responsibilities; namely, administering the religious affairs and heading all the judges. The fandiyaaraa who is the religious leader of the community is the person whom the people love and revere with all their hearts. They believe that he is the best person among them both in religious and legal education. As the fandiyaaraa would always be a person who knows Arabic, it is he who takes the burden of teaching them the Qur‚Äôan and its meaning. There are many Naa‚Äôibs and Khateebs under him.‚Äù The scope of the duties of the fandiyaaraa had been widening since the time of Pyrard. Authors like Ibn Batuta and Pyrard also emphasized that the judges were, at least to some extent, the religious leaders. However, the writings of Christopher goes on to state clearly that the fandiyaaraa was the religious leader as well. Then came the visit of Harry Charles Purvis Bell, in 1921. Bell said that ‚Äúthe fandiyaaru always had a great influence both on the affairs of the common people and on the affairs of the state. As the history of the Maldives testifies, the fandiyaaraa is always a person who was capable of exerting influence on the political, internal, and external affairs of the state. He is respected by everyone alike, from the King himself to the laymen.‚Äù #After Islam, judges appeared as authorities who were responsible for implementing the legal system, which was composed of the Islamic Shari‚Äôah, customs and traditions and the decrees of the King. Later the judges became religious leaders and by the end of the 19th century they were taken not just as administrators of justice but also as religious Imams. #The judiciary was composed of the judges in Male‚Äô and the Bodu Naa‚Äôibs in the Atolls and the Naa‚Äôibs in the islands. The Naa‚Äôib who was the legal authority in each island was at the end of the hierarchy at which he follows the Bodu Naa‚Äôib. The latter is the chief authority of justice for an atoll. The fandiyaaru is at the top of the hierarchy and the other two are directly under his control. However, the fandiyaaru is not the ultimate authority in the judiciary. The king always had the final say in all disputes. This had been a feature of the Maldivian Judicial system throughout the known history. #The King, who was the head of the executive was always the head of the judiciary; in no time in the history of the Maldives was the judiciary an independent institution of the state. #Although the judiciary was a specialized institution in the political arena of the Maldives, at no time in the history of the country was there a special building which housed the judicial system. Since the courts are an essential element of a judiciary, one may question on this matter. However, since the palace of the King and the private residence of the Judges and Naa‚Äôibs were used as places where the judiciary came into operation, it may be considered that they were the courts. Constitutional period The beginning of the constitutional period in the Maldives marked the beginning of a significant era. The first constitution of the Maldives was officially declared in 1932. That constitution divided the powers of the State among four different bodies, which were the King, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Legislature, and the Peoples‚Äô Majlis. Notably, the judiciary is not included as an independent organ of the state. Article 80 of this constitution says that ‚Äúthe officials responsible for administering justice are independent as long as they do not, in the process, violate the law.‚Äô‚Äô However, another provision has somewhat a contradictory tone. ‚ÄúThe King will not meddle with the judicial operations of the state. However, the administration of justice shall be done in the name of the King and, in accordance with his decrees.‚Äù This was a codification of the system which had been in practice for many centuries. The judicial system of the Maldives had already been a specialized institution, which was under the direct control and supervision of the King. The first constitution brought no changes to the system whatsoever. Yet, the judiciary was under the direct control of the King and, hence, no other organ in the state had any power, or a formal capability, to influence the judiciary. Therefore, it may be said that the judiciary was independent from other organs of the state. Amendments were brought to the first constitution in later years, until a new constitution was finally declared in 1942. Neither any amendment to the first constitution nor the new constitution declared in 1942 made any changes to the provisions of the first constitution regarding the judicial system of the state. Amendments were brought to the Constitution of 1942 until it was replaced with a new one in 1953. This Constitution was also in the same position as the previous ones as regards the dividing of the powers of the state. However, unlike the previous constitutions, it gave a more detailed attention to the institution of the judge and other officials under the judge. It provided that there should be a ‚Äòfandiyaaruge‚Äô (a Court) in the Maldives and that the officials of this institution would consist the ‚ÄòUththama fandiyaaru‚Äô (Supreme Judge) and a certain number of Naa‚Äôibs. The first amendment to the Constitution of 1953 was made in 1954. The latter also gave the same provision on the judicial system. It did not give the judiciary the status of a separate organ, and provided that the King was the highest authority in the administration of justice. This constitution provided that the judge was to be responsible for administering justice in the name of the King and also to uphold the banners of Islam in the country. No changes were brought to the structure of the judicial system until a new constitution was again declared in 1968. This constitution divided the powers of the state into three organs, namely, the President, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Peoples‚Äô Majilis. Here again the judiciary was not considered as a separate organ of the state. There was a separate chapter which included provisions regarding the judiciary. The first article in this chapter provided that the administration of justice would be in the hands of special officials appointed by the President. The responsibility of upholding the banners of Islam, imposed by the previous constitutions was lifted from the judiciary by this constitution. That may be a step towards a higher level of specialization of the judicial system. The amendments brought to the Constitution of 1968 did not bring any changes to the pattern of the judiciary. It is the new Constitution of 1998 which established the judiciary as a separate organ of the state of the Maldives for the first time. This is obviously a major change to the structure of the judicial system of the country. This constitution provided that there shall be a High Court in the Maldives and that the High Court would consist of a Chief Judge and a number of judges appointed by the President. It also provides that there shall be courts of law in the Maldives, the number of which would be decided by the President at his discretion, and that there shall be judges in these courts appointed by the President. This Constitution also gives the President the highest authority in the administration of justice. Based on this provision the judiciary is still under the control of the Head of the State. Therefore, judiciary is not an independent organ of the state in the Maldives. Rather, it is a specialized organ of the state, which deals only with the administration of justice. = Court system during the constitutional period = According to the present structure of the Maldivian judiciary, the High Court is the highest authority in the administration of justice and this institution is directly under the control of the President. However, the lower courts are under the Ministry of Justice, a limb of the Executive organ of the state, and not under the High Court. The Ministry of Justice came into being in 1909 in the form of Mahkamah al-Shariyyaah. This institution evolved to become the Ministry of Justice in 1968. When the Mahkamah al-Shariyyah came into being six officials were there in the Mahkamah to adjudicate in legal matters. In 1955, the Mahkamah was reformed and the administration of this institution was strengthened. In accordance with the new system, three tables were created in the Mahkamah, with a Judge and a Naa‚Äôib for each table. During the same year, a legal commission was appointed for each ward of Male. In 1966, the tasks of the Mahkamah were divided and a thaana latter (from ‚Äòhaa‚Äô to ‚Äòalif‚Äô) was given to each section of the institution. In accordance with the new arrangements, ‚Äòhaa‚Äô was the section of the Chief Judge. During the same year, the sections were numbered from 1-7. later some changes were brought to this arrangement and finally, in 1980, the 8 divisions of the Ministry of Justice were converted into 8 courts, with a numerical number given to each of them. Until the present Constitution the court system had been like this. However, with the present Constitution, a major change occurred, with the eight courts being abolished and a completely new four courts coming into being. These courts are the Family Court, the Criminal Court, the Civil Court, and the Juvenile Court. The functions of these courts can easily be implied from the names; the Family Court is concerned with all family affaires in general; the Criminal Court decides in criminal cases, the Juvenile Court in all cases in which children are involved and the Civil Court with all civil cases except family affaires. Separate offices for legal officials or the Naa‚Äôibs were created in the atolls in 1962. During this time, an office of the Naa‚Äôib was established in each island. Later, an Atoll Court was established in each atoll in 1970. In 1979 all the Atoll Courts and Naa‚Äôib Offices were abolished and an Island Court was established in each island. Since then, no major changes have come about in the judicial structure of the atolls. With the Constitution of 2008, the Maldivian Judiciary has entered a new phase of transformation and progress. Under the Constitution, the Maldivian Judiciary is as independent as it has ever being, and the current Constitution established, for the first time in the history of the Maldives, a Supreme Court, and declared it the highest institution of the Maldivian Judiciary. The structure of the Judiciary is as follows: * Supreme Court is the highest Court, * The High Court of the Maldives. * The third level in the hierarchy stand four superior courts in Male‚Äô:  the Criminal Court,  the Civil Court,  the Family Court,  the Juvenile Court  the Drug Court * At the fourth and the last level of the hierarchy, there are the Magistrate Courts, which are the subordinate courts. Magistrate courts are located in the administrative divisions of the atolls of the Maldives, with a Magistrate Court in each inhabited island. At the moment, there are 194 Magistrate Courts in the country. * The Administrative arm of Maldives Judiciary is Department of Judicial Administration.

Both politically and economically the mark was an independent community, and its earliest members were doubtless blood relatives. In its origin the word is the same as mark or march, a boundary. First used in this sense, it was then applied to the land cleared by the settlers in the forest areas of Germany, and later it was used for the system which prevailed to what extent or for how long is uncertain in that country. It is generally assumed that the lands of the mark were divided into three portions; forest, meadow and arable, and as in the manorial system which was later in vogue elsewhere, a system of rotation of crops in two, three or even six fields was adopted, each member of the community having rights of pasture in the forest and the meadow, and a certain share of the arable. The mark was a self-governing community. Its affairs were ordered by the marknien who met together at stated times in the markmoot. Soon, however, their freedom was encroached upon, and in the course of a very short time it disappeared altogether. Controversy The extent and nature of the mark system has been, and still is, a subject of controversy among historians. One school holds that it was almost universal in Germany; that it was, in fact, the typical Teutonic method of holding and cultivating the land. From Germany, it is argued, it was introduced by the Angle and Saxon invaders into England, where it was extensively adopted, being the foundation upon which the prevailing land system in early England was built. An opposing school denies entirely the existence of the mark system, and a French writer, Fustel de Coulanges, refers to it contemptuously as a figment of the Teutonic imagination. This view is based largely upon the supposition that common ownership of the land was practically unknown among the early Germans, and was by no means general among the early English. The truth will doubtless be found to lie somewhere between the two extremes. The complete mark system was certainly not prevalent in Anglo-Saxon England, nor did it exist very widely, or for any very long period in Germany, but the system which did prevail in these two countries contained elements which are also found in the mark system.

That is, they act as a sort of clearing house of information about customers' reliability. In Great Britain and some European countries trade protective societies, composed of merchants and tradesmen, have been formed for the promotion of trade, and members exchange information regarding the standing of business houses. These societies had their origin in the associations formed in the middle of the 18th century for the purpose of disseminating information regarding bankruptcies, assignments and bills of sale. The mercantile agency in the United States is a much more comprehensive organization. It came into existence after the financial crisis of 1837. Trade in the United States had become scattered over a wide territory. Communication was slow, and the town merchant was without adequate information as to the standing of many businessmen seeking credit. Undoubtedly the severity of the collapse of 1837 was due in part to the insufficiency of this information. New York City merchants, who had suffered so severely, determined to organize a headquarters where reports regarding the standing of customers could be exchanged. Lewis Tappan (1788‚Äì1873), founder of the Journal of Commerce (1828) and a prominent anti-slavery leader, undertook the work, and established in New York, in 1841, the Mercantile Agency, later Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, the first organization of its kind.

The character is adapted from √ûj√°lfi, a character in Norse mythology by Dan Jurgens. Character history=Childhood and Apotheosis= Thialfi began his life as a human boy centuries ago. Viking marauders from the north raided his peaceful Norse village and his parents ran for their lives. They were intercepted by a marauder, who brutally murdered his father and left Thialfi and his mother to die. Later, when the Vikings were celebrating their victory and giving praise to Odin and Asgard, a young and naive Thor appeared before them to join in their revelry. Thialfi's mother P'aesi interrupted them, however; she accused Thor of inciting the Vikings to murder, which Thor of course denied, claiming death was simply a consequence of battle. P'aesi assured Thor that there was no battle, merely the wholesale slaughter of a village, including women and children. Thor decided to see the battlefield and judge for himself, but as he walked away a Viking declared P'aesi a blasphemer and killed her. Thor returned immediately and looked on the scene with horror. He chastised the Vikings for their brutality and told them that their gods urged them to defend themselves, not murder innocents. He flew P'aesi's corpse over to the battlefield, where the bodies of women and children were strewn alongside those of the men, just as P'aesi had said. Thialfi was there and, upon seeing P'aesi, ran over to her and began crying. Thor yelled to his father Odin, who appeared before him. Odin responded that the humans behaved that way because they were inherently flawed, so it was best to just turn away. Thor was galled at Odin's apparent lack of compassion and demanded that he at least help Thialfi, who had been rendered an orphan because of the gods. Odin agreed despite Thor's insolent tone, but demanded a boon in return. He used the Odinforce to transform Thialfi into an Asgardian \\"blessed with wisdom, insight and speed enow to escape any enemy.\\" His boon turned out to be that Thor find Thialfi a home in Asgard and that, upon Thialfi's coming of age, Thor return to him and treat him as he would his closest friend. =Royal Advisor= After Odin's death at the hands of Surtur, Thor ascended to the throne and followed Odin's instructions, taking Thialfi as his personal advisor. Thialfi's sudden inclusion in Thor's close-knit circle of allies caused some tension at first, especially with Balder, Thor's best friend since childhood. Eventually Thialfi proved himself‚Äîhe saved Thor's life by delivering the Bloodaxe to him in battle against Desakand was accepted. When the cabal of businessmen and political leaders made their strike against Asgard, Thialfi was caught in the turmoil. He noticed Zarrko escaping and tried to stop him, but he unwittingly ended up falling through Zarrko's temporal portal into the future. =Future Betrayal= Thialfi emerged in the year 2170 to find Earth completely transformed by Thor into New Asgard. At first Thialfi was overjoyed that Thor had finally managed to put the gods' power to use constructing a utopia for the humans Thialfi still identified with; but after Mistress Kya, the mutant sorceress daughter of the Scarlet Witch, and her band of resistance fighters showed him Mjolnir abandoned, Thialfi began to doubt Thor. His fears were confirmed when he witnessed Loki's police force quell an uprising through sheer brutality without even trying to find another solution. Thor's regime had benefitted some, but it had also robbed humanity of its self-reliance. After exchanging words with Thor's son Magni, which planted the same seed of doubt that Kya had given him, Thialfi resolved that, in order for humankind to regain its lost potential, Thor must die. He attempted to kill his friend and king the night he was to enter the Odinsleep. He misjudged the loyalty of Thor's inner circle, however. Thor's wife the Enchantress managed to free Odin's pet wolf Freki, who killed Thialfi. Powers and abilities Thialfi was transformed from a human being into a member of the Asgardian race by Odin. Thialfi had superhuman strength and a high resistance to injury due to the increased density of his Asgardian body, as well as an extremely long life span and immunity to all Earthly diseases. Odin enchanted Thialfi with a high degree of superhuman speed, as well. Additionally, Thialfi presumably received training in the Asgardian arts of war granting him some proficiency in armed and unarmed combat. =Weapons and equipment= For situations where running was not enough, Thialfi used one of Asgard's many flying horses for transportation.

This tool can illuminate the presence of contradictions in processes that cannot be detected by any single questionnaire item using a traditional format such as the Likert scale. The diamond of opposites is a sociometric scaling method that simultaneously measures positive and negative responses to a statement. Psychodrama/Sociometry: The psychological approach to counseling and exploring issues, both personal and in a wider social context, was founded by J.L. Moreno in the 1920s. His unique approach to therapy and social change at that time involved using theater and roleplay to assist individuals and groups to change/ improve their life circumstances, and a somewhat lesser known approach, called Sociometry, to measuring social dynamics in groups, and effect change in groups and society. Sociometry measures the connections between individuals in any group, from small groups to world issues. Measuring connections and feelings within a group assists individuals within the group to make desired/ needed changes, and also provides a wealth of information about the dynamics in any particular group or situation. The Diamond of Opposites is one type of sociometric assessment. Unlike traditional question formats, especially the semantic differential format where the respondent must choose a point on a one-dimensional scale anchored by two semantically opposite terms, the diamond of opposites allows the respondent to express attraction and repulsion independently. In this format, the stem describes an object, person or situation in relation to which the respondent is asked to indicate their degree of attraction and repulsion. The two variables are plotted on two orthogonal axes.  Example  mathematics problems * Indicate your level of attraction on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) * Indicate your level of repulsion on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) # The respondent indicates attraction of x' = 8, and repulsion of y' = 5. # The point (x',y') represents the current attitude of the respondent toward mathematics problems.

Cotton-spinning machinery refers to machines which process (or spin) prepared cotton roving into workable yarn or thread. Such machinery can be dated back centuries. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as part of the Industrial Revolution cotton-spinning machinery was developed to bring mass production to the cotton industry. Cotton spinning machinery was installed in large factories, commonly known as cotton mills. History=Spinning wheel= The spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by 1030. It later spread to China by 1090, and then spread from the Islamic world to Europe and India by the 13th century. Until the 1740s all spinning was done by hand using a spinning wheel. The state of the art spinning wheel in England was known as the Jersey wheel however an alternative wheel, the Saxony wheel was a double band treadle spinning wheel where the spindle rotated faster than the traveller in a ratio of 8:6, drawing on both was done by the spinners fingers. =Lewis Paul and John Wyatt= In 1738 Lewis Paul and John Wyatt of Birmingham patented the Roller Spinning machine and the flyer-and-bobbin system, for drawing cotton to a more even thickness, using two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds. This principle was the basis of Richard Arkwright's later water frame design. By 1742 Paul and Wyatt had opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey, this was not profitable and soon closed. A factory was opened in Northampton in 1743, with fifty spindles turning on five of Paul and Wyatt's machines, proving more successful than their first mill; this operated until 1764. Lewis Paul invented the hand-driven carding machine in 1748. A coat of wire slips were placed around a card, which was then wrapped around a cylinder. Lewis' invention was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, although the design came under suspicion after a fire at Daniel Bourn's factory in Leominster which used Paul and Wyatt's spindles. Bourn produced a similar patent in the same year. Old advertising display of items used in cotton textile manufacture during the industrial revolution Rev John Dyer of Northampton recognised the importance of the Paul and Wyatt cotton spinning machine in a poem in 1757: > A circular machine, of new design > In conic shape: it draws and spins a thread > Without the tedious toil of needless hands. > A wheel invisible, beneath the floor, > To ev'ry member of th' harmonius frame, > Gives necessary motion. One intent > O'erlooks the work; the carded wool, he says, > So smoothly lapped around those cylinders, > Which gently turning, yield it to yon cirue > Of upright spindles, which with rapid whirl > Spin out in long extenet an even twine. =Spinning jenny= The spinning jenny that was used in textile mills The spinning jenny is a multi-spool spinning wheel. It was invented circa 1764, its invention attributed to James Hargreaves in Stanhill, near Blackburn, Lancashire. The spinning jenny was essentially an adaptation of the spinning wheel. =Water frame= Arkwright's spinning frame The Water frame was developed and patented by Arkwright in the 1770s. The roving was attenuated (stretched) by drafting rollers and twisted by winding it onto a spindle. It was heavy large scale machine that needed to be driven by power, which in the late 18th century meant by a water wheel. Cotton mills were designed for the purpose by Arkwright, Jedediah Strutt and others along the River Derwent in Derbyshire. Water frames could only spin weft. =Spinning mule= A fully restored & working mule at the Quarry Bank Mill, UK. The spinning mule or mule jenny was created in 1779 by Samuel Crompton. It was a combination of Arkwright's water frame and Hargreaves' spinning jenny. It was so named because it was a hybrid of these two machines. The mule consisted of a fixed frame containing a creel of bobbins holding the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage containing the spindles. It used an intermittent process: On the outward traverse, the rovings were paid out, and twisted, and the return traverse, the roving was clamped and the spindles reversed taking up the newly spun thread. The rival machine, the throstle frame or ring frame was a continuous process, where the roving was drawn twisted and wrapped in one action. The spinning mule became self-acting (automatic) in 1830s. The mule was the most common spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900, but was still used for fine yarns until the 1960s. A cotton mill in 1890 would contain over 60 mules, each with 1320 spindles. Between the years 1824 and 1830 Richard Roberts invented a mechanism that rendered all parts of the mule self-acting, regulating the rotation of the spindles during the inward run of the carriage. The Platt Brothers, based in Oldham, Greater Manchester were amongst the most prominent machine makers in this field of work. At first this machine was only used to spin coarse and low-to-medium counts, but it is now employed to spin all counts of yarn. =Throstle= The Throstle frame was a descendant of the water frame. It used the same principles, was better engineered and driven by steam. In 1828 the Danforth throstle frame was invented in the United States. The heavy flyer caused the spindle to vibrate, and the yarn snarled every time the frame was stopped. Not a success. It was named throstle, as the noise it made when running was compared to the song of the throstle (thrush). =Ring frame= Modern ring spinning frame 1 Draughting rollers 2 Spindle 3 Attenuated roving 4 Thread guides 5 Anti-ballooning ring 6 Traveller 7 Rings 8 Thread on bobbin The Ring frame is credited to John Thorp in Rhode Island in 1828/9 and developed by Mr. Jencks of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, who () names as the inventor. The bobbins or tubes may be filled from \\"cops\\", \\"ring spools\\" or \\"hanks\\", but a stop motion is required for each thread, which will come into operation immediately a fracture occurs. =Break or open-end spinningDREF friction spinning=Further processes For many purposes, the threads as spun by the ring frame or the mule are ready for the manufacturer; but where extra strength or smoothness is required, as in threads for sewing, crocheting, hosiery, lace and carpets; also where multicoloured effects are needed, as in Grandrelle, or some special form of irregularity, as in corkscrewed, and knopped yarns, two or more single threads are compounded and twisted together. This operation is known as \\"doubling\\".

The main objective is to determine whether the protein in question is a soluble or a transmembrane protein. History SOSUI's algorithm was developed in 1996 at Tokyo University. The name means as much as \\"hydrophobic\\", an allusion to its molecular \\"clients\\". How SOSUI works First of all, SOSUI looks for Œ± helices that are relatively easy to predict, taking into account the known helical potentials of the given amino acid sequence(AAS). The much more difficult task is to differentiate between the Œ± helices in soluble proteins and the ones in transmembrane proteins, the Œ± helix being a very common secondary structure pattern in proteins. SOSUI uses 4 characteristics of the AAS in its prediction: # \\"hydropathy index\\" (Kyte und Doolittle 1982) # weighted presence of amphiphilic amino acids (AA) and their localization: \\"amphiphilicity index\\" # the AA's charge # the length of the AAS An important improvement compared to Kyte und Doolittle's \\"hydropathy index\\", which relies entirely on one characteristic, is the introduction of the so-called \\"amphiphilicity index\\". It is calculated by giving every AA with an amphiphilic residue a certain value which is derived from the AA's molecular structure. To meet SOSUI's criteria for amphiphilicity, the polar, hydrophilic residue may not be linked directly to the beta-carbon; there must be at least one apolar carbon interposed (therefore only lysine, arginine, histidine, glutamic acid, glutamine, tryptophan and tyrosine are relevant). SOSUI then looks for accumulations of amphiphilic AAs at the ends of Œ± helices, which seems to be typical for transmembrane Œ± helices (it makes the transmembrane position the energetically best one for these Œ± helices by placing amphiphilic AAs at the lipid-water boundary and is thus co-responsible for the protein's correct localization). The AA's charge is also taken into consideration; the length is important because biological lipid membranes have a certain thickness determining the length of membrane-spanning proteins. According to a study published by SOSUI's developers it successfully differentiated 99% of a chosen group of proteins with known structure . However, another study that had several prediction tools perform on the AAS's of 122 known proteins claimed that SOSUI was correct about the number of Œ± helices in only about 60% of the cases . But even if the number of transmembrane domains is not always exact, the differentiation between soluble and transmembrane proteins often works, as it is only necessary to find out if a protein has such a domain at all. Of course, membrane proteins which don't have transmembrane Œ± helices (e.g. porins) or which are fixed with a covalent bond cannot be found by SOSUI. Results The result page first shows general information (length, average hydrophobicity). If the protein in question is a transmembrane protein, the number of transmembrane domains and their localization is noted. A \\"hydropathy-profile\\" with colored accents of hydrophobic parts; the helical wheel diagrams of potential transmembrane domains are shown as well.

Costello claimed the song was written as an ode to a woman he saw working at a supermarket, though he has remained vague on the meaning. Though Costello's single never charted, it has become one of his most famous tracks. Linda Ronstadt, who covered the song and released her version in 1979, had a moderate hit with it. There have also been several other cover versions of this song. Background The song \\"Alison\\" was included on Elvis Costello's debut studio album My Aim Is True as the fifth track, and was released in 1977. As \\"Alison\\" was recorded before Elvis Costello and the Attractions formed, his backing band on the track was Clover. Costello has divulged little on the meaning of the song other than to say that it is about \\"disappointing somebody\\" and to deny suggestions that the lines \\"somebody better put out the big light\\" and \\"my aim is true\\" refer to murder. He has also declined to reveal who the song is about, writing in the liner notes for Girls Girls Girls, \\"Much could be undone by saying more.\\" The line \\"my aim is true\\" gives the album its title. Costello has also said that the musical idea for the chorus, breaking up the line \\"I know this world is killing you\\", in a staccato fashion, derives from the manner that the line \\"Life ain't so easy when you're a ...\\", precedes the title refrain, on \\"Ghetto Child\\", by The Detroit Spinners. Elvis Costello, Unfaithful Music, p.187 However, in his 2015 autobiography Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink, Costello wrote: \\"I've always told people that I wrote the song 'Alison' after seeing a beautiful checkout girl at the local supermarket. She had a face for which a ship might have once been named. Scoundrels might once have fought mist-swathed duels to defend her honour. Now she was punching in the prices on cans of beans at a cash register and looking as if all the hopes and dreams of her youth were draining away. All that were left would soon be squandered to a ruffian who told her convenient lies and trapped her still further\\". Costello and Billie Joe Armstrong, of Green Day, played the song live together on VH1 Classic's \\"Decades Rock Live\\". The performance originally aired on 19 May 2006. Reception \\"Alison\\" was released as a single in the United Kingdom with a B-side of \\"Welcome to the Working Week\\", and as two singles in the United States; one with a mono version of the same song on the B-side, the other with \\"Miracle Man\\". The US (and Canadian) single versions of \\"Alison\\" are unique in that it is remixed to add a string section. The single did not chart; as the album on which it was included did reach the top 40 on the album charts, the song did get airplay in the U.S. on album-oriented rock radio. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked it No. 318 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and Entertainment Weekly voted it as one of Costello's top 10 greatest tunes. The Telegraph named it Costello's second greatest song only after \\"Oliver's Army\\", calling it \\"a wonderful song about unrequited love.\\" Linda Ronstadt version=Background= Linda Ronstadt recorded a cover version of \\"Alison\\" for her studio album Living in the USA, in 1978, which sold over 2 million copies. Released as the disc's fourth single in the spring of 1979 on Asylum Records, it was produced by her longtime producer Peter Asher. Ronstadt's B-side to \\"Alison\\" was \\"Mohammed's Radio\\", also produced by Asher. =Reception= Ronstadt's version of \\"Alison\\" was a moderate hit, reaching number 30 in the U.S. on the Billboard adult contemporary chart. Her single also reached number 66 in the UK Singles chart.Roberts, David (2006). British Hit Singles & Albums (19th ed.). London: Guinness World Records Limited. p. 469. . Years later, Costello joked that he might have been publicly derisive of Ronstadt's version, \\"but I didn't mind spending the money that she earned me\\". Costello donated royalties from Ronstadt's version to the African National Congress after she played at Sun City in South Africa.

It derives from functionalist theories of crime and was developed by Ivan Nye (1958), who proposed that there were three types of control: * Direct: by which punishment is threatened or applied for wrongful behavior, and compliance is rewarded by parents, family, and authority figures. * Indirect: by identification with those who influence behavior, say because his or her delinquent act might cause pain and disappointment to parents and others with whom he or she has close relationships. * Internal: by which a youth refrains from delinquency through the conscience or superego. Definition Social control theory proposes that people's relationships, commitments, values, norms, and beliefs encourage them not to break the law. Thus, if moral codes are internalized and individuals are tied into and have a stake in their wider community, they will voluntarily limit their propensity to commit deviant acts. The theory seeks to understand the ways in which it is possible to reduce the likelihood of criminality developing in individuals. It does not consider motivational issues, simply starting that human beings may choose to engage in a wide range of activities, unless the range is limited by the processes of socialization and social learning. The theory derives from a Hobbesian view of human nature as represented in Leviathan, i.e. that all choices are constrained by implicit social contracts, agreements and arrangements among people. Thus, morality is created in the construction of social order, assigning costs and consequences to certain choices and defining some as evil, immoral and/or illegal. Proponents=Albert J. Reiss= Another early form of the theory was proposed by Reiss (1951) who defined delinquency as, \\"...behavior consequent to the failure of personal and social controls.\\" Personal control was defined as, \\"...the ability of the individual to refrain from meeting needs in ways which conflict with the norms and rules of the community\\" while social control was, \\"...the ability of social groups or institutions to make norms or rules effective.\\" Reiss' version did not specify the sources of such \\"abilities\\" nor the specific control mechanisms leading to conformity, but he did assert that the failure of primary groups such as the family to provide reinforcement for non-delinquent roles and values was crucial to the explanation of delinquency. Reiss also wrote extensively on the application of his work to criminology.Albert J Reiss in Encyclopedia of Criminological Theory vol I (2010) FT Cullen, P Wilcox =Jackson Toby= Jackson Toby (1957), argued that \\"the uncommitted adolescent is a candidate for gang socialization.\\" acknowledging \\"gang socialization\\" as part of the causal, motivational dynamic leading to delinquency, but introduced the concept of stakes in conformity to explain \\"candidacy\\" for such learning experiences. He believed that all could be tempted into delinquency, but most refused because they considered that they had too much to lose. The young who had few stakes or investments in conformity were more likely to be drawn into gang activity. The notion of stakes in conformity fits very well with concepts invoked in later versions of social control theory. =F. Ivan Nye= Ivan Nye (1958) not only elaborated a social control theory of delinquency, but specified ways to \\"operationalize\\" (measure) control mechanisms and related them to self-reports of delinquent behavior. He formulated the theory after interviewing 780 young people in Washington State. The sample was criticized because it did not represent any urban environments, and those selected might have been more apt to describe their families unfavorably. Some were concerned that criminal activity was only mentioned in two of the questions, so the extrapolations to crime in general were considered unsafe. Like Reiss, he focused on the family as a source of control. Moreover, Nye specified three different types of control: *direct control = punishments and rewards *indirect control = affectionate identification with non-criminals; and *internal control = conscience or sense of guilt. Youth may be directly controlled through constraints imposed by parents, limiting the opportunity for delinquency, as well as through parental rewards and punishments. However, they may be constrained when free from direct control by their anticipation of parental disapproval (indirect control), or through the development of a conscience, an internal constraint on behavior. The focus on the family as a source of control was in marked contrast to the emphasis on economic circumstances as a source of criminogenic motivation at the time. Although he acknowledged motivational forces by stating that, \\"...some delinquent behavior results from a combination of positive learning and weak and ineffective social control\\" (1958: 4), he adopted a control-theory position when he proposed that, \\"...most delinquent behavior is the result of insufficient social control...\\" =Walter Reckless= Walter Reckless (1961) developed containment theory by focusing on a youth's self-conception or self-image of being a good person as an insulator against peer pressure to engage in delinquency. *inner containment = positive sense of self; *outer containment = supervision and discipline. This inner containment through self-images is developed within the family and is essentially formed by about the age of twelve. Outer containment was a reflection of strong social relationships with teachers and other sources of conventional socialization within the neighborhood. The basic proposition is there are \\"pushes\\" and \\"pulls\\" that will produce delinquent behavior unless they are counteracted by containment. The motivations to deviate as pushes are: *discontent with living conditions and family conflicts; *aggressiveness and hostility, perhaps due to biological factors; and *frustration and boredom, say arising from membership of a minority group or through lack of opportunities to advance in school or find employment; and the pulls are: *delinquent peers, and *delinquent subcultures. =David Matza= An analysis of 'neutralization' was developed by Sykes and Matza (1957) who believed that there was little difference between delinquents and non-delinquents, with delinquents engaging in non-delinquent behavior most of the time. They also asserted that most delinquents eventually opt out of the delinquent lifestyle as they grow older, suggesting that there is a basic code of morality in place but that the young are able to deviate by using techniques of neutralization, i.e. they can temporarily suspend the applicability of norms by developing attitudes \\"favorable to deviant behavior\\". The five common techniques were: *denial of responsibility (I couldn't help myself) *denial of injury (nobody got hurt) *denial of victim (they had it coming) *condemnation of the condemners (what right do they have to criticize me?) *appeal to higher loyalties (I did it for someone else). Later Matza (1964) developed his theory of \\"drift\\" which proposed that people used neutralization to drift in and out of conventional behaviour, taking a temporary break from moral restraints. Matza based his \\"drift\\" theory upon four observations which were: *Delinquents express guilt over their criminal acts *Delinquents often respect law-abiding individuals *A line is drawn between those they can victimize and those they can not *Delinquents are not immune to the demands of conforming Although this theory of drift has not been widely supported by empirical tests, it remains a key idea in criminology despite not answering why some conform and others don't. =Travis Hirschi= Travis Hirschi adopted Toby's concept of an investment in conventionality or \\"stake in conformity\\". He stressed the rationality in the decision whether to engage in crime and argued that a person was less likely to choose crime if they had strong social bonds.  The general theory of crime  Hirschi has since moved away from his bonding theory, and in co-operation with Michael R. Gottfredson, developed a general theory or \\"self-control theory\\" in 1990. Akers (1991) argued that a major weakness of this new theory was that Gottfredson and Hirschi did not define self-control and the tendency toward criminal behavior separately. By not deliberately operationalizing self-control traits and criminal behavior or criminal acts individually, it suggests that the concepts of low self-control and propensity for criminal behavior are the same. Hirschi and Gottfredson (1993) rebutted Akers argument by suggesting it was actually an indication of the consistency of general theory. That is, the theory is internally consistent by conceptualizing crime and deriving from that a concept of the offender's traits. The research community remains divided on whether the general theory is sustainable but there is emerging confirmation of some of its predictions (e.g. LaGrange & Silverman: 1999) =Jack P. Gibbs= Gibbs (1989) has redefined social control and applied it to develop a control theory of homicide. Any attempt to get an individual to do or refrain from doing something can be considered an attempt at control. To qualify as 'social' control, such attempts must involve three parties. One or more individuals intends to manipulate the behavior of another by or through a third party. Gibbs' third party can be an actual person or a reference to \\"society\\", \\"expectations\\" or \\"norms\\". For example, if one party attempts to influence another by threatening to refer the matter to a third party assumed to have authority, this is referential social control. If one party attempts to control another by punishing a third (e.g. general deterrence), it is a form of vicarious social control. The presence of the third party distinguishes social control from mere external behavioral control, simple interpersonal responses, or issuing orders for someone to do something. This definition clearly distinguishes social control from mere \\"reactions to deviance\\" and from deviant behavior itself. Gibbs argues that \\"Homicide can be described either as control or as resulting from control failure\\" (1989: 35), and proposes that the homicide rate is a function not just of the sheer volume of disputes, but also of the frequency of recourse to a third party for peaceful dispute settlement (p37). When one person fails to control the actions of another through the third party, murder represents another violent attempt at direct control. People resort to self-help when forms of social control are unavailable or fail. Gibbs is critical of Hirschi's Social Control Theory because it merely assumes that social relationships, personal investments and beliefs that discourage delinquency are social controls (which is one reason why Hirschi's theory is often referred to as a Social Bond Theory). Criticism Much of the early research on social control theory is based on self-reporting studies. Critics of self-report data note that there may be various motives for disclosing information, and that questions may be interpreted differently by individual participants. Nevertheless, many of the conclusions are intuitively convincing, e.g. that individuals will not engage in crime if they think that this will sacrifice the affection or respect of significant others, or cause them to lose employment or their autonomy if they face imprisonment. Davies (1994 and 2004), reports that in late-nineteenth century Britain, crime rates fell dramatically, as did drug and alcohol abuse, and illegitimacy became less common. All of these indexes of deviance were fairly steady between World War I and 1955. After 1955, they all rose to create a U-curve of deviance, over the period from 1847 to 1997. He attributes the initial shift to adoption of a culture in which the assumptions of Protestant Christianity were taken for granted. Everyone at the time believed‚Äîat least somewhat‚Äîin a moral code of helping others. This belief was rooted in religion. The same social norms for the defense of the person and property that informed the law before 1955 remain the policy norms. Furthermore, the concept that people are uncontrollable and may offend against those norms in social interactions, cannot be explained by simply counting how many people practice the golden rule (see the general discussion in Braithwaite: 1989.)

Krulik's work frequently explores the fringes of popular culture from an enthusiastic and appreciative point of view. He is best known for his 1986 documentary Heavy Metal Parking Lot, co-produced by John Heyn, a gently disturbing (but, for the most part, fun-loving) look into hard-rock fandom recorded at the Capital Centre parking lot in Landover, Maryland, before a Judas Priest concert. Most of the fans appear drunken and drugged, with \\"bare feet, muscle shirts, bare-chested, bleach blonde frizzy perms, mullets from hell, big hair, bad teeth, scar tissue, and by far the largest collection of late '70s Camaros ever seen in one location.\\" Cult director John Waters said of the film, \\"It gave me the creeps.\\" Background  Heavy Metal Parking Lot, for a decade or more, circulated through word-of-mouth, via the internet and on second-to-nth-generation bootlegged copies. A 20th-anniversary DVD edition with sequels, outtakes, where-are-they-now bonus footage and other inspirations is now available for sale. In his first professional position, Krulik served as the Metrovision Public-access television cable TV channel coordinator for the southern portion of Prince George's County, Maryland, a community that has inspired several of his films, including Public Access Gibberish (1990), a \\"greatest hits\\" montage of the most bizarre acts during his tenure at the cable access channel. Other films are Neil Diamond Parking Lot (1996), about the fans before a Neil Diamond concert at the same stadium as Heavy Metal Parking Lot, one decade later; and Ernest Borgnine on the Bus (1997), a documentary about actor Ernest Borgnine, his son and his custom RV; a compilation of many of the director's short films titled Heavy Metal Parking Lot: The Films of Jeff Krulik was released several years ago. Most of these films, along with films made by Krulik's friends and some additional found footage, are viewable for free in streaming formats on his official website. In 2004, the Trio cable channel began broadcasting a show by Krulik titled Parking Lot, which expanded on the \\"parking lot\\" documentary series started in the 1980s. Created & co-produced by Jeff Krulik and John Heyn (in association with Radical Media), eight episodes were filmed, although it is unclear as to how many of them were actually broadcast. It does not appear that the program will be shown again on the channel. In 2010 Jeff released Heavy Metal Picnic, edited by Greg DeLiso, a feature-length, semi-follow-up to Parking Lot. Picnic chronicles the goings on at a weekend-long field party in Potomac, Maryland in 1985. The party was captured on video by a few of the patrons wielding a VHS camcorder and a stolen CBS microphone. Jeff interviews the men behind the camera, the party's organizer and some of the attendees, who had not previously seen the footage. Heavy Metal Picnic was released on August 6, 2010. Krulik also directed Led Zeppelin Played Here, about a Maryland youth center where Led Zeppelin supposedly performed on its first US tour.

It is also known as North Head Quarantine Station & Reserve and Quarantine Station & Reserve. The property is owned by the Office of Environment and Heritage, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The buildings and site was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The entire North Head site, including the Quarantine Station and associated buildings and facilities, was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 12 May 2006, and now forms part of the Sydney Harbour National Park. The complex operated as a quarantine station from 14 August 1832 to 29 February 1984. The concept behind its establishment was that, as an island-nation, the Colony of New South Wales, as it then was, was susceptible to ship-borne disease. Those who might have an infectious disease would be kept in quarantine until it was considered safe to release them. The isolation and strategic role of North Head was recognised in 1828 when the first vessel, the Bussorah Merchant, was quarantined at Spring Cove. The importance and future role of North Head was reinforced by Governor Darling's Quarantine Act of 1832, which set aside the whole of North Head for quarantine purposes in response to the 1829‚Äì51 cholera pandemic in Europe. The station is now home to a hotel, conference centre, and restaurant complex known as Q Station,Q Station Homepage and remains part of the Sydney Harbour National Park. One of the early quarantine officers was Dr James Stuart, a keen naturalist and painter. For many years Percy Nolan, an alderman and mayor of Manly, pushed for the removal of the Quarantine Station from Manly and called for its use as public open space. Over sixty years later, this far-sighted proposal became a reality. In the 1960s and 70s, the officer then in charge of the Quarantine Station, Herb Lavaring BEM (1917‚Äì1998), took it upon himself to preserve and compile a museum of artifacts and other items of note and significance to the station's operations, including domestic implements, medical instruments, and hand tools for tasks ranging from blacksmithing to building construction. Lavaring collected these materials over the period 1963‚Äì1975 and also commenced restoration work on the diverse range of rock carvings and headstones from the major burial grounds. The items collected by Lavaring were preserved, and many have since found their way into state and federal collections, including the National Museum in Canberra, where a muzzle-loading rifle and a set of manacles are preserved (the latter being used to ensure that no one left the station without medical clearance). One of the most historic features of the quarantine station is the series of engravings along the escarpment adjacent to the jetty. The carvings were executed by people staying at the quarantine station, and cover an extensive period that stretched from the early nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. Some were executed by stonemasons and sculptors and show a high degree of skill. More carvings are located at the rock formation known as Old Man's Hat.  History  The Quarantine Station was established primarily to regulate the risk of disease importation through the migration of free and convict Europeans, and the arrival of merchant shipping. There was always a close link between the requirement for quarantine and the ebb and flow of sea-borne immigration; and the growth of the Quarantine Station from the 1830s parallels the changes in immigration policy and practice. The other major influence was the imperative to limit disruption to the increasingly commercially-sensitive shipping industry. As the dominant headland of the harbour, North Head was of importance in navigation from the time of the First Fleet. By 1809 navigational plans were showing an obelisk, located in what was to become the Quarantine Station precinct, presumed to have been used as a channel marker for vessels negotiating the Sow and Pigs Reef. A obelisk still exists on this site, which may be the original marker, making it potentially one of the oldest European structures on Sydney Harbour. Up until the 1830s, the majority of ships requiring quarantine were convict transports, and being under government contract, the somewhat informal proclamation of quarantine by the Governor of the day was easy to enforce. One reason for the introduction of formal statutory regulation for quarantine in NSW in 1832 was the increasing rate of free immigrant vessels entering port. In 1831 thirty four immigrant ships had arrived, and this increased to 63 in 1832. The captains of these free vessels were less ready to comply with such informal and ad hoc processes, thus a legislated requirement for all ships entering port to be screened for disease, and quarantined if necessary, was needed. Another problem with the changing nature of the shipping entering Sydney was the increasing time constraints placed on the captains of commercial vessels, necessitating rapid turn-around in port-time wasted in port, and in quarantine, was income lost. The convict ships, under government contract, could be isolated for the period of quarantine with little added expense, but free commercial carriers sought demurrage from government for any delays it imposed. In part, the disruption to shipping caused by traditional quarantine practices led to the progressive move away from detention-based quarantine in Britain through the middle years of the 19th century. = Following passage of the Quarantine Act, 1832 = When the 1832 Quarantine Act was passed in NSW, Viscount Goderich, British Secretary of State for War and Colonies, warned that quarantine was prejudicial to the trade of the kingdom and that the colony should be aware of the importance of \\"not aggravating by unnecessary restrictions the embarrassment inseparable from a strict quarantine on British Vessels\\". The initial quarantine practice of housing the sick on board the vessel in which they arrived, was dispensed with after the experience with the long detention of the Lady Macnaghten in 1837, and the subsequent heavy demurrage claimed for that delay. After that time the sick were removed from their ship and housed ashore, while the ship was fumigated and scoured for return to the owner with the minimum delay. A consequence of this decision was the construction of permanent accommodation and stores buildings at the Quarantine Station at North Head. The alarming experiences of quarantine in 1837 and 1838 prompted a review in the colony of the organisation and conditions aboard immigrant ships. The final report, arising as a NSW initiative, pricked the sensitivities of the British emigration officials, but nevertheless had positive outcomes. The review indicated that there was insufficient checking of the health of the emigrants before boarding; there was insufficient concern with diet during the voyage, especially for the needs of children; and that the formula of three children equalling one adult when allocating food and berth space aboard required reconsideration, as it led to excessive number of children in cramped spaces, with inadequate food. Finally it indicated that the surgeon-superintendent aboard ship required more authority to regulate and promote good health and good order among the emigrants. The subsequent reorganisation of the system resulted in interviews and medical checks on would-be emigrants before embarking them; vaccination for smallpox of all emigrants; the signing of undertakings to follow the directions of the surgeon-superintendent on voyage and better definition of his role and powers; improvements in diet and hospital accommodation aboard; and moves to prevent overcrowding. The rate of mortality improved dramatically. In 1840 the death rate for children fell from one in ten to one in seventeen, and that for adults also fell. With the improved conditions the rate of quarantine declaration of immigrant ships also fell in 1840, from three ships out of 43 in 1839 to one out of 40 in 1840. Immigration was reduced from 1842 due to the economic recession in the colony, as the decline in land sales had reduced the pool of funds earmarked to support the migration scheme. Immigration was at a standstill from 1842 until 1848, and only one ship was quarantined in this period. The resumption of immigration in 1847-48 led to a review of the adequacy of the Quarantine Station, but no real increase in accommodation resulted. The arrival of the Beejapore in 1853, with over one thousand passengers, at a time when the Quarantine Station could accommodate 150 persons, triggered a new building phase. As a temporary measure, the hulk Harmony was purchased and moored in Spring Cove as a hospital ship. The Beejapore was an experiment in trying to reduce migration costs by using two-deck vessels, and the outcome was judged not to be a success. Fifty-five people died during the voyage, and a further sixty two died at the Quarantine Station, from the illnesses of measles, scarlet fever and typhus fever. The majority of the passengers and crew had to be housed in tents. The biggest impetus for change came not so much from a concern about poor housing, but rather a concern for the morals of the married women and the \\"200 single women let loose in the bush\\" that represented the undeveloped station at that time. The resulting changes to the station, besides the use of the hospital ship, included the construction of a barracks for the single women in the former Sick Ground, surrounded by a double fence with a sentry stationed between them, to prevent communication with the women. Two new buildings were built in the Healthy Ground, each to house sixty people, with verandahs for dining. The original burial ground was levelled and the grave stones removed to the new burial ground, thus further removing the burials from the view of the Healthy Ground. Eight quarters were also built for the Superintendent. =1860s to 1890s= The downturn in immigration during the economically stagnant period of the 1860s, triggered by the colonial government cancelling the regulations to provide assisted passage to migrants in 1860, limited the use of the Quarantine Station, and the willingness of the government to spend money on its upkeep. As a result of this downturn between 1860 and 1879 only 138 immigrant vessels arrived [compared with 410 between 1840 and 1859], and of these 33 required cleansing at the Quarantine Station, but few required their passengers to be landed and accommodated. In the same period 29 merchant or naval vessels were quarantined, but again mainly for the cleansing of the ship rather than the landing of diseased crews. The run-down Quarantine Station had become unsuitable for passenger quarantine, and particularly for first and second class passenger accommodation, by the time the Hero was in need of quarantine for smallpox in 1872. The passengers were kept aboard the ship, because the station could not adequately house them. The inadequacy was further publicised during the quarantine of the Baroda in 1873, when first class passengers had to do their own washing. Well-connected passengers ensured that government attention was focussed on the shortcomings of the Station accommodation. As result, a new group of First Class accommodation buildings were built in the Healthy Ground. As steam navigation became more common, the costs of delays to shipping schedules by quarantine became more pressing. By the 1870s the detention of a steamer could cost from ¬£20 to ¬£300 per day, and shipping agents and owners could not see why Australia was not following Britain's lead in abandoning quarantine regulations. In response the Assistant Health Officer was based at Watson's Bay from 1882, to reduce delays in inspection. The Shipping Owner's Association also requested the provision of Asiatic accommodation at the Quarantine Station, a better supply of water there, the supply of a steam launch to take supplies to the quarantined ships, and printed instructions for Captains of quarantined vessels.11 The issue of abandoning quarantine was raised again in 1882, and in his report on the issue the new Health Officer, C.H. Mackellar, dismissed the suggestion and suggested a federation of quarantine efforts, to detect and cleanse infected ships as they reached the continent at places such as Thursday Island and Albany, not just as they reached Sydney. Mackellar also recommended the upgrade of the Station, with the introduction of a light tram, a new reservoir, improved cleansing facilities at the wharf, a better hospital, new accommodation, and picket fences to delineate zones in the quarantine. Most of these suggestions were acted on, and some of the buildings survive. =1900s to date= When the Commonwealth took over responsibility for the Quarantine Service after 1909, and particularly after the creation of the Department of Health in 1921, the nature of quarantine changed for merchant shipping. The Commonwealth drew together the Quarantine Stations in the various states, and tried to diversify the operations so that some ships were intercepted at out-lying ports before they reached Sydney. Albany, Melbourne and Thursday Island, in particular played a major role in this new pattern of nationwide quarantine. The growth of the other states also meant that shipping was more evenly distributed in terms of destination than had been the case in the nineteenth century. In the period 1901 to 1940, Sydney and Melbourne had roughly similar numbers of assisted immigrants (134,864 and 115,988 respectively), and the other States had, in combination, more immigrants than either Sydney or Melbourne, totalling 174,526. By 1958 there were 39 \\"first ports of entry\\" into Australia. Thirty-two sea ports had staff capable of carrying out quarantine inspections, ten ports were \\"landing places\\" for air entry; major quarantine stations with accommodation were established at five ports, and there were three minor quarantine stations at other Ports. The impact of improved medical science, immunisation, and quarantine procedures in the twentieth century is perhaps shown most dramatically by the fact that though the post-WWII immigration was vastly more than had gone before, the number of ships or aeroplanes quarantined plummeted proportionately. Sydney received nearly 700,000 assisted immigrants between 1946 and 1980, or nearly double the number it had received between 1831 and 1940, yet only four ships were quarantined in that period and at least one of those was a tanker. In all, between 1828 and 1984 at least 580 vessels were quarantined at the Quarantine Station. More than 13,000 people were quarantined at the station of whom an estimated 572 died and were buried there.NPWS, 2000  Description = European/Asian cultural heritage = North Head is situated at the entrance to Sydney Harbour. It is a huge sandstone bluff rising above sea level. At the time of settlement North Head was linked to the mainland by only a narrow sand spit that separated the harbour from the sea. Early depictions of North Head show the dramatic upheaval of the land form that sloped from the high cliffs on the eastern seaboard back to the protected waters of the harbour to the west. Today North Head appears as a natural extension of the Manly peninsula due to the filling of medium rise building development on the low-lying land of the present-day site of Manly and the mature vegetation through that urban development. The Quarantine Station is situated on the western side of North Head, on the natural amphitheatre of land centred on Quarantine beach. The site was originally designated as all the land with a radius of the beach. The area is fringed by a continuous tract of bushland on the north, south and eastern sides, and by the harbour on the western side. The curtilage for this Conservation Management Plan is the western side of North Head, which has the Quarantine Station as its core. In order to allow description and analysis of this study curtilage, five precincts have been delineated within the study curtilage as follows: #the Quarantine Station Precinct; #the Park Hill Precinct; #the Spring Cove Precinct; #the Quarantine [South] Precinct; and #the Marine Precinct. In addition, where Quarantine Station-related sites occur beyond the briefed study area (such as within the Department of Defence- owned property), these sites are detailed following the \\"precinctual\\" discussion. Each of these precincts and related Quarantine Station sites are examined below. Within the physical overview of the buildings and site elements of the various precincts, the \\"description fields\\" have been used, as appropriate.  Historical archaeology sites  As a preamble to the precinct-specific overview, summary statements that relate to the historical inscriptions, the historical archaeology sites, and cultural landscape features for the study area have been informed by the 1985 and 1992 Conservation Plans 1 and 2, and by NPWS publications and other reports. =The historical inscriptions= Quarantine internees commenced a tradition of making inscriptions, including poems, initials, memorials and drawings, in the 1830s. This continued throughout the life of the Quarantine Station. Nineteenth and early twentieth century examples include engraved and painted inscriptions on soft sandstone faces, structures and slate storm-water drain covers. Eight hundred and fifty four examples have been recorded, though at least 1,000 other examples exist. The inscriptions commemorate quarantine events, ships and people from the ships and deceased internees. They are located throughout the place with concentrations around the Wharf Precinct and The Old Mans Hat. English and other European, Asian and Arabic languages were used. The most recent inscriptions are a series of written examples on internal walls of Building A20, deriving from its use as a detention centre for illegal immigrants. Most of these appear to have been written by people from the Pacific Islands, some in islander languages, many being laments on their authors' detention or abuses directed at their detainers. Most of the inscriptions are on quarried or natural sandstone surfaces. A few occur on cement or plaster surfaces and several on built elements such as brick walls, drain covers and the Cannae Point flagstaff. Some have been re-worked in the past or are highlighted by paint. A large percentage of the inscriptions are in good condition, easily located and readily legible. Aspect, topography and environmental agents [sun, wind, rain] affect the condition of inscriptions but the major factor is the quality of stone, i.e. the softer less silicified the sandstone the faster it deteriorates. Seeping ground water, lichen, moss, wind and vegetation abrasion and visitor contact are additional agents of deterioration. The latter is now minimised through a policy of controlled access. The inscriptions in Building A20 have a life limited to that of the paintwork and plaster render on internal walls. A preliminary analysis of European rock inscriptions was completed in 1983, and an interim report on the conservation of rock inscriptions at the Quarantine Station was completed in March 1999, as part of a joint project between the NPWS, Sydney, North Sub- District and the NPWS Cultural Heritage Services Division. The recommendations of the 1983 analysis were: #that the engravings at The Old Mans Hat be recorded by a similar program (such as that at the Quarantine Station core precinct) in order to complete the record of the resource; #that, it funds become available, an indexing system of the inscriptions be devised for the complete resource; and #that further research is carried out to identify whether similar engravings have been located at other Quarantine facilities as a means of assessing the National Heritage value of this material. The 1999 Interim Report provided specific conservation recommendations for the Wharf Area and The Old Mans Hat inscriptions, and general conservation management recommendations for visitor management and monitoring. These recommendations are included as recommendations of this Plan. The inscriptions are valuable and unusual graphic illustrations of historical incidents and social patterns of Quarantine Station history. They provide a very tangible and \\"human\\" link with the past for present generations and are a valuable historical and genealogical resource. Their research potential is enormous. The inscriptions record a variety of information which cannot be obtained from any other source, especially the feelings of non-English speaking migrants. =Historical archaeological sites= The 1998 North Head Quarantine Station Conservation Plan archaeological survey forms the current basis of assessment of areas within the active Quarantine Station area. That report diagrammatically indicated the historical archaeological sites and structures within or adjacent the North Head Quarantine Station core precinct. The 1991 North Head archaeological site survey forms the basis of the assessment of areas outside the active Quarantine Station area. That report indicated the following historical archaeological sites and structures within or adjacent the North Head Quarantine Station study area: #the sandstone boundary wall leading from the North Head Road to Collins Beach; #the sandstone boundary wall south-east of the Quarantine Station (Site No. L10); #the Australian Institute of Police Management, incorporating parts of the venereal diseases hospital, the Second and Third Quarantine Cemeteries (Sites L1 and VA1); and #the Old Mans Hat inscription area; and the Quarantine Head gun emplacement. All of these sites and structures are related to the history of the Quarantine Station, and are significant physical evidence of the development and contraction of quarantine functions over time. However, the vast majority of buildings and archaeological sites are located within the zone of most intensive quarantine activity, which is more or less contiguous with the current NPWS managed area of the Quarantine Station. The NPWS has carried out a number of historical archaeological surveys of areas of the Quarantine Station itself, though there has as yet been no systematic survey of the entire study area. These surveys have identified a large number of former building sites and other features, and has indicated where as yet unlocated building sites might be located. The site numbers beginning with \\"P\\" relate to \\"Potential Sites\\". Forty-eight such sites had been identified by 1992. Because the Quarantine Station has experienced over 150 years of quarantine activity, there is a layering of evidence on and in the ground that reflects the slow growth of the Station, the major development and redevelopment programs, and the subsequent removals and constructions. This evidence exists as independent evidence, though it is also complementary to the documentary evidence, and in large part cannot be interpreted without reference to the latter. Because the land-use over this period has been solely devoted to quarantine, the evidence is, on the whole, only impacted by later quarantine activity, so the understanding of both the creation and the destruction of the former buildings and landscape elements contributes to the story of quarantine. Because in many cases current building a relocated on the same sites as earlier building, and as many of the surviving buildings have a long history of their own, all sub- floor deposits are considered to have archaeological potential. The changes over time reflected by the surviving buildings and features and the archaeological sites reflect various aspects of the history of quarantine, public health and society as a whole. The stories able to be illuminated by the physical evidence include, among many others: the Aboriginal occupation of North Head; the changing attitudes to quarantine and its administration; the developing medical and epidemiological knowledge; the development of Australia's immigration policies, and the experience of individuals and groups within that history; the changing attitudes to class and race; the iconography used by inmates to memorialise their experience, in the 1,000 plus inscriptions, memorials and gravestones, and Australia's experience of war, both in the diseases contracted by the military personnel buried in the Quarantine Station cemeteries, and in the direct defence of Sydney. An unusual aspect of the collection of historical archaeological evidence at the Quarantine Station is that it all contributes to the understanding of this one theme of quarantine as well as to associated broader themes, and a large amount of evidence appears to have survived. This vests the archaeological sites with a very high research potential for ongoing study of this important aspect of Australian history. In addition to the archaeological potential of buildings which have been demolished, the Quarantine Station buildings also offer the opportunity to research the archaeology of standing structures. As a tightly dated and well-documented group of buildings they have potential to provide information on changes in domestic living arrangements over the past 150 years. Since 1992 a number of the potential sites have been confirmed by the location of above-ground evidence, or the identification of evidence during works. A systematic survey and recording program is required both within and outside of the Planning Area to identify the complete historical archaeological resource. This comprehensive survey is required as much of the archaeological resource of the Quarantine Station is confined to the thin vegetated surface and the poorly consolidated sandy soils beneath. The fragility of the sites makes them prone to disturbance from excessive foot or vehicle traffic, erosion and animal burrowing. A preliminary Archaeological Management Plan has been prepared by the NPWS to accompany this Conservation Management Plan; and the policy recommendations of that Plan have been incorporated into this Conservation Management Plan. =The Quarantine Station cultural landscape= Quarantine Station buildings, pictured in 1986 The landscape of the Quarantine Station core precinct can be properly described as a cultural landscape. It is a landscape heavily impacted by human activity, even the \\"natural\\" bushland areas are humanly modified; and the most obvious elements in the landscape are the various layers of human clearing and construction, amid large areas of bushland and interspersed with bush patches. The main developed area consists of the Quarantine Station itself. This has three main groups of buildings: the wharf and foreshore buildings at Quarantine Beach, the hospital group, and the buildings on the upper grassy slopes, with grassy cleared areas around these groups, delineated by bushland remnants and regrowth. This creates a semi-rural, village-like atmosphere which is uncommon in the otherwise closely developed Sydney metropolitan area. The cultural landscape has heritage values in its own right, as a document demonstrating the planning and construction of the station over its entire life. The landscape also has a strong interpretative value. The isolation of the Station, the long views out to other parts of the harbour, the contrast between manicured grassy areas and surrounding bush, which was alien to most of the inmates, and the strict classification of occupation areas within the Station, combine to trigger the historical imagination and allow the visitor to empathise with those quarantined here. The landscape is also visually important not only to visitors to the Quarantine Station but also to viewers from other headlands, suburbs or on the harbour. Many distinctive or prominent landscape elements contribute to the multiple layering of human experience on the landscape. A strong element in the cultural landscape is the conscious and enforced \\"classification\\" of the land, based on health issues, class and race. This includes the isolation of the hospital, seen but not approached from many parts of the Station; the wharf and \\"disinfection\\" area, which stood as a barrier between the inmates and the main line of escape, and the administration area, which \\"guarded\\" the land route out; the lateral separation of the first, second and third class passengers, with the administration area interposed between third class and the rest, imposing class distinctions in the landscape; and the lateral and elevational separation of the Asian accommodation, away from first and second class, and below third class, imposing a racial layer on top of the class one. The following discussion of the Quarantine Station cultural landscape refers specifically to the cultural landscape elements which provide the meaning and understanding of how these landscapes worked historically. These elements include the Quarantine Station cemeteries; monuments; fences and walls; boundary markers and walls; obelisks and cairns; and of course tracks, paths and roads. =Cemeteries= A memorial stone for passengers and crew of the ship, Constitution, who died either on passage to Australia, or following arrival in May 1905, while the passengers were in quarantine Three cemeteries functioned throughout the history of the Station. The approximate location of the First Cemetery (Site IIIA1, ), is at the junction of the Wharf and Hospital roads, however no visible evidence remains, so it is not a landscape element except to those with knowledge of its existence. The unfortunate positioning of the First Cemetery, always in the view of the well and recovering, was soon recognised, and the subsequent cemeteries were moved out of the perceived landscape of those quarantined. The Second Cemetery (Site L1, 1853-1881), is located east of the 3rd Class precinct. Three headstones remain in situ (two obscured by vegetation), and the outline of another two graves visible. The cemetery is separated from the experiential landscape of the quarantined unless they chose to visit it. The Third Cemetery (Site VA1, 1881-1925), is within the School of Artillery, on Commonwealth property. Two hundred and forty one burials are registered, and the cemetery retains many headstones and markers, protected by a chain wire three-metre high person- proof fence. This cemetery is even more removed from the Quarantine Station landscape than the second cemetery was. The Second and Third cemeteries become obscured and prone to bushfire if native vegetation is not regularly slashed. Erosion of grave sites occurs if the cemeteries are heavily visited or if stabilising vegetation, especially grasses, is removed. There has been natural weathering and corrosion of sandstone headstones and wooden cross grave markers. Uncontrolled public access to these cemeteries, especially the Third, can result in vandalism or theft of remaining headstones and grave markers. Some headstones from the First and Second cemeteries are now located in the artefact store within Building A20. Further research is required to relocate obscured graves. The cemeteries are powerful reminders of the purpose of the Quarantine Station, its successes and failures and of its internees. They have historical, archaeological, genealogical and educational significance and special significance for descendants of those interred in them. An archaeological assessment of the North Head Quarantine Station cemeteries; and an archaeological inspection report of the Third Quarantine Station cemetery have been prepared by the NPWS. These documents provide specific policy recommendations related to the conservation and management of the cemeteries, which are accepted as recommendations of this Conservation Management Plan. This is a marble and sandstone monument which stands on the ridge above the 3rd Class Precinct. It commemorates the quarantining of the ship Constitution and its passengers and crew in 1855 and the reunion of surviving passengers and crew at the Quarantine Station 50 years later. It is in fair condition and requires some stonework and plaque repairs. It is symbolic of the events associated with, and the esprit de corps of, one ship's passengers and crew. Like the inscriptions in the Wharf precinct, it is one of the more obvious memorialising features in the Station landscape. =Fences and walls= The Quarantine Station study area landscape includes a variety of fences and walls which are integral to the history and past functioning of the place. Fencing, generally paling fences, was the primary means of enforcing the separation of different groups of internees at the Quarantine Station. The impact of the fences, and clearing of bushland, on the appearance of the Station can be judged from historic photographs. The loss of the majority of fences creates a false impression of the Quarantine Station's layout and reduces the ability to experience the segregation that passengers were required to maintain. In this sense the cultural landscape significance of the fences has been lost, but could be regained by reconstruction. These include: *prominent sandstone block, barrier walls, built in the 1930s Great Depression by workers on unemployment relief programs. These are located along boundary lines which show the subdivision of the Quarantine ground at that time for hospital, recreation and military purposes; a double chain wire three feet [one metre] high fence at the entry gate to the place which served as a \\"neutral zone\\" across which internees could talk with visitors; *wooden paling fences around the staff cottages; *chain wire fences around the Isolation and Hospital precincts which separated them from healthy areas; *foreshore stone and concrete walls at the Quarantine Beach wharf; *low sandstone block kerbing and retaining walls on the main access roads; and *section of remnant paling fences in bush around the Hospital area. The sandstone block walls are generally in fair-to-good condition. Some sections, however, have collapsed due to water erosion undermining their footings. Further sections are in imminent danger of collapse. Blocks in the wall end near The Old Mans Hat have seriously eroded due to wind and salty sea spray. Wire fences are substantially intact, though are prone to rusting. Existing timber fences around staff cottages are of recent construction [1985-90], mostly in good condition, though prone to distortion due to high winds. The stone walls and site fencing generally are important legacies of quarantine isolation practices. =Obelisk= A prominent sandstone obelisk stands on the south-eastern edge of the Station. An obelisk is shown at this location on site plans dating from 1807‚Äì09, though it is not known if the existing one is the original. The memorial is in fair condition but requires some stonework repairs at the base. It may prove to be highly significant, if it is the original, as the oldest surviving structure on North Head and one of the oldest on Sydney Harbour. The obelisk is one of the few landscape elements relating to a non-quarantine function, though as navigation markers they relate to the overall maritime themes that include quarantine. =Roads and paths= Roads and paths throughout the place include the bitumen roads, sandstone-paved roads and pedestrian paths to The Old Mans Hat area and between the wharf and hospital areas. There is a hierarchy of paths and roads, ranging from sealed vehicle roads, through sealed footpaths and ramps, to unsealed tracks, especially into the surrounding bushland. These reflect how the landscape was lived in, and the strong separation of the managed landscape of the Station precincts and the informality of the surrounding areas such as The Old Mans Hat. =Stone cairn (Site IIIA3)= A stone cairn at Quarantine Station, pictured in 1986 A sandstone cairn stands adjacent to the 2nd Class Passenger Accommodation building P12. Built during the late 1830s, this is the sole remaining cairn of a line of thirteen which denoted the early boundary of the quarantine ground. It is in good condition. This cairn is the earliest surviving in situ structure associated with the place's quarantine function and demonstrates the early need for isolation and security. = Natural heritage =Overview and description The study area for the natural heritage plan specifically requires consideration of the water body and the sea bed between Cannae Point and Spring Cove, including Quarantine Beach and store Beach; the Third Quarantine Cemetery within the former Defence land at North Head, and associated installations. The natural heritage items are those items recorded as occurring in the subject study area, or those items with a high probability of occurring within the area, based on studies, surveys and reports of the flora and fauna on North Head generally. Native bushland in the North Head Defence property and other parts of the North Head component of Sydney Harbour National Park is contiguous with bushland within the study area and fauna may move from one area to another. Some fauna may occur sporadically or seasonally in different parts of North Head, and others such as raptors have territories which span large areas regardless of roads, walls or fences. Therefore, some of the conservation significance of the study area is linked to the wider context of North Head as a whole and even beyond. For example, the significance of the Little Penguin colony is considered in the context of other colonies and the feeding range of individual birds. The maintenance of genetic diversity within plant communities is aided by free movement of bird, mammal and insect pollinators. Wind-borne pollen is dispersed widely; however maximum distances between plants which still allow effective pollination are seldom studied and, in consequence, little understood. It is axiomatic that larger units of vegetation enhance the prospects of long term survival of genetic diversity in remnant plant communities. Thus the biodiversity values of plants and animals in the study area are discussed in the broader context of those parts of North Head which are within Sydney Harbour National Park. Such an approach is appropriate for this Conservation Management Plan because the areas to the north and south of the Quarantine Station are declared as National Park, and their management for nature conservation in perpetuity is determined by the plan of management required under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974. The approach is also consistent with the requirements identified in the Commonwealth to State Land Exchange Agreement of 1979. Little penguin colony, Little Collins Beach Little Collins Beach has the only known mainland NSW breeding ground for the endangered Little Penguin, a colony which is protected by volunteers, each breeding season, to control predators.Daily Telegraph, 16/6/17 This was the scene of a massacre in 2015 when a fox attacked and killed 27 penguins, depleting the population. The colony extends from North Head to Manly Wharf.  Heritage listing  The North Head Quarantine Station Study Area is an integral element of the North Head peninsula. The Aboriginal and Natural values of the NHQS relate to the peninsula as a whole; and the European/Asian cultural values relate to the most of the peninsula, for the whole area was once Quarantine Reserve. The area represents a place of cultural and natural diversity reflecting the evolution of Sydney from Aboriginal occupation through European settlement to the landscape of today, representing many social, historic, recreational, environmental and educational values. The Heads maintain an iconic presence to the city as the gateway to Port Jackson and Sydney Harbour, and the city. The Aboriginal heritage values of the North Head area are an intrinsic part of the significance of the place. Numerous Aboriginal traditions from various parts of the continent refer to and intermesh the creation of their natural and cultural environment; Sydney Harbour can be seen as the outcome of such a creative period. Aborigines were demonstrably present in the Sydney Basin many thousands of years before the present coastline was formed and would have experienced the actual creation of Port Jackson and Sydney Harbour with its rich and complex environment. The North Head area along with the other areas that form Sydney Harbour National Park retain Aboriginal heritage values in a physical setting that is substantially intact although embedded in the important urban setting of Sydney. On a national scale, the Port Jackson environment, including North Head, formed the scene of or backdrop for some of the earliest and formative interaction between Aborigines and the British explorers and settlers. Archaeological sites remnant at NHQS are seen as symbolising Aboriginal prehistory and contact history. Just as the Heads became a symbol to \\"New\\" Australians of a possible new and better life, they are seen by many Aborigines as a symbol of their loss and disenfranchisement. Evidence of Aboriginal occupation is evident in more than forty recorded sites. An exceptional wealth of further information may be contained in the archaeology of the place and in particular in the Pleistocene sand dunes; the only undisturbed, vegetated high-level sand dunes in the Sydney region. Rare and endangered species of flora and fauna are refuged at the place and in the wider area of North Head. Considered alone or ecologically as part of North Head, the Quarantine Station area includes significant geodiversity and biodiversity components of the natural heritage of New South Wales. The Station is situated on an isolated cliff-bound tied island complex formed by the interaction of strong bedrock and erosion associated with changes of sea level tens of thousands of years ago. The headland is capped by Pleistocene high-level sand dunes which also occur within the Station complex. The natural biodiversity consists of isolated, remnant and disjunct communities, populations and species, six of which are scheduled on the Threatened Species Conservation Act [NSW] 1995. In addition to the threatened plant species there are over 450 other species of vascular plants and ferns representing 109 plant families. This level of genetic diversity is remarkable and scientifically important. The endangered population of Little Penguin is significant as the only population of this species which breeds on the mainland of NSW. The characteristics which have enabled this population to persist in one of the busiest commercial harbours in the world are important for scientific study. The endangered population of Long-nosed Bandicoot is also scientifically important as a remnant population of a specie which was formerly common and widespread in the Sydney region. The few remaining trees of Camfields Stringybark are a significant component of the entire genetic resource of this vulnerable species. =North Head Quarantine Station= The Quarantine Station occupies the first site officially designated as a place of Quarantine for people entering Australia. It is the nation's oldest and most intact facility of its type and can thus be ascribed national significance. Together with Point Nepean Station, and in terms of the story of quarantine and its role in controlled migration to Australia, the two Stations have to be considered as being nationally significant quarantine sites. The Station's use remained essentially unchanged from 1828 to 1984, and all buildings and development on the site reflect the changing social and scientific demands of Quarantine during that period. The formation and development of the Quarantine Station relates directly to the growth of Australia as a remote island nation. It symbolises the distance travelled and perils faced by many immigrants who first stood on Australian soil at the Quarantine Station. The site has symbolic significance for these reasons. The history of the site reflects the changing social and racial values of the Australian community and the development of medical practices in controlling infectious diseases. The site has historic significance in demonstrating and elucidating major themes in Australian history, immigration, the development of society and government, social welfare and health care, treatment of disease, transport and conservation. Evidence of the hardships experienced by European and Asian internees during their detention in Quarantine and the tragic deaths of some of them, is powerfully conveyed by the inscriptions on the gravestones, monuments and amongst the random inscriptions scattered throughout the site. The rugged topography of the southern rock cliffs in the area of the Old Mans Hat, where the power of the sea is manifest, and where the healthy and sick internees sought relief from the confinement of the Quarantine Station, contrasts strongly with the sanctuary of Quarantine and Store Beaches, where European vessels were first quarantine and from where the food gathering and cultural activities of Aboriginal people were abruptly halted. The views to the Station and to North Head from the city of Sydney; and from the Station down the length of Port Jackson are significant for their iconic value. The class system which permeated Colonial society in this country is illustrated clearly in the extant building fabric and in cultural landscape which contains the subtle evidence of the fences and paths which were contrived to maintain absolute separation between the classes and races, and between the healthy and the sick, the dying and the dead, at the Quarantine Station. The whole place displays evidence of natural systems, historic built forms and historical associations with the experience of quarantine have been retained largely intact due to its relative isolation on North Head. North Head Quarantine Station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. ;European/Asian heritage The North Head Quarantine Station is the oldest and most intact of the quarantine stations in Australia. It was always the pre-eminent place of quarantine among the colonies, both because of its early beginnings, and because it led in many of the advances in quarantine practice. The Station's function remained unchanged from 1828 to 1984 and all buildings and developments illustrate the changing social and scientific demands of quarantine during that period. The station was also central to the development of the colony of NSW's responses to local epidemics of infectious diseases.The history of the Quarantine Station, which is well illustrated by its buildings, sites, landscapes and the functions that took place there, interconnects with a number of key themes in NSW's history. The demands of quarantine, and the spotlight this cast on health standards, forced improvements in the conditions experienced by immigrants travelling to NSW, through the nineteenth century in particular. The procedures established for the quarantine of inbound shipping set the foundation for responding to the various local smallpox, plague and influenza epidemics up until the 1920s. The Quarantine Station also provided a safe haven to which the ill could be removed and treated. On a broader scale, the Quarantine Station dramatically demonstrates, in its development of arrangements to separate and deal differently with different classes and races of people, the changes in the social attitudes of the colony and State. This separation based on social status was most clearly evidenced by the barrier fences erected between the various class \\"compounds\\". The final transfer of the Quarantine Station to the State reflected the now-common pattern whereby land formerly reserved for special purposes, and protected from the development pressures of the urban areas surrounding them, became valued for the cultural and natural values they possessed and were re-gazetted for conservation purposes when no longer needed for their special purposes. ;Natural heritage Some of the earliest collections of marine specimens were made at Spring Cove and are now housed in the Australian Museum. These collections were made in the 1830s and therefore have significance in the natural history of Sydney Harbour. The Little Penguin population is the only remaining mainland population of this species in New South Wales. This is important to the natural history of this species. Continued survival of the Little Penguin is equally important to the future pattern of conservation management of endangered species. The successful management of other threatened species in the Quarantine Station is similarly important to the course of NSW's natural history. The effects on other biodiversity elements of the further decline or loss of these threatened species is unknown but could be significant to the natural history of the place. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. ;Aboriginal heritage North Head is associated with the Aboriginal presence, ownership and use of the land prior to and after European settlement as a site where the Cameraigal Aboriginal clan first saw the European settlers. As part of the wider Manly area it is associated with named Aboriginal persons, such as Bungaree's wife Gooseberry, Bennelong and Wil-le- me-ring, who played a part in the early European settlement of Sydney. Due to an apparent misunderstanding, Governor Phillip was speared by Wil-le-me-ring in a bay in or near the Quarantine area, possibly Spring Cove or Little Manly Cove. ;European/Asian heritage The Quarantine Station has played an important part in the lives of many Australians, with over 13,000 persons, including convicts and free migrants to NSW and many Sydney residents, being quarantined, of whom an estimated 572 have died and are buried there. The inscriptions at the site are an unusual testimony to those associations. The Station has also been closely associated with the administration of health by NSW and the Commonwealth, and a number of health administrators prominent in the development of NSW's public health policies and practices have had close and long associations with the Station. These included Deas Thomson, Capt. H.H. Browne, Dr Savage, Dr Allyne, Dr J. H. L. Cumpston, and Dr W. P. Norris. The Station also has association with the architects and designers and builders who created the Station; particularly the office of the NSW Colonial Architect to 1908, and the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways, particularly George Oakeshore of the Sydney office. There has been no comprehensive survey of the architects/designers involved in the NHQS buildings. The Station played a pivotal role in the post-WWII period with the housing of illegal immigrants as detainees and refugees to Australia. The Station thus reflects the maritime arrival and \\"processing\\" not only of quarantined immigrants, but also of illegal and refugee arrivals. The 'down- turn' in Station activity parallelled the post-WWII change to airborne migration. Finally, the Station was the setting for socio-political dramas such as the revolt of the returned and quarantined troops after WWI; and the confrontations between secular and religious authorities in NSW over access by religious entities to the Quarantine Station. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. ;European/Asian heritage The Quarantine Station has a cultural landscape that is distinctly associated with its unusual functions. It was a landscape of rigid control, which is associated with and reinforced the institutional and functional nature of the place. The present day Harbour context is now recognised as being a visually attractive setting of natural bush and harbour views. The unity of the design and form of the buildings, set within grassy precincts, which convey a pleasant village-like feeling, unusual within the Sydney metropolitan area.The Quarantine Station bears witness to the evolution of public health policy in NSW and Australia generally, and the development of practices and procedures designed to protect the colony, state and nation from infectious disease. The quarantine system, which reached its full form in the first decades of this century, was a significant technical achievement, and was in part developed at the North Head Quarantine Station where it is well demonstrated in the surviving fabric. Aspects of this technical achievement can be seen in the remanent quarantine technology at the Station e.g. The fumigation chamber, shower blocks and autoclaves. ;Natural heritage The aesthetic characteristics derived from the natural values of heath vegetation and sandstone cliff geomorphology within the Quarantine Station are an integral part of the outstanding aesthetic values of North Head conserved as part of the Sydney Harbour National Park. These values are derived from the expanse of uninterrupted cliff face and vegetated headlands. They are appreciated and enjoyed both from offshore and within Port Jackson. Together with those of South Head, they have enormous emotional impact on people arriving and leaving Sydney by sea. This impact is greater because the sheer cliff faces are capped with continuous low heath vegetation rather than tall forest or prominent buildings. Spectacular views of the drowned valley system of North and Middle Harbours are seen from within the Quarantine Station. The place is has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. ;Aboriginal heritage Aboriginal heritage values at North Head, including the Quarantine Station area, are important to the Aboriginal community in general, and to the local community especially for a wide range of reasons, social, cultural and spiritual. Aboriginal presence in the area is older than Sydney Harbour as it is known today. Port Jackson and Sydney Harbour have been the scene of some of the earliest fateful interactions between Aborigines and the British invaders. The surviving North Head Aboriginal sites are seen as symbolising Aboriginal history of recent centuries as well as earlier times. The area is one of the last within Sydney Harbour environment where Aboriginal heritage values have been retained in a physical setting that is substantially intact along with Dobroyd, Middle, Georges, Bradleys, South and Balls Heads; Mount Treffle at Nielsen Park; and the Hermitage Reserve. This environment allows the Aboriginal community to educate the younger and future generations as well as others about Aboriginal history, life styles and values and provides a chance of experiencing some of the atmosphere and quality of traditional Aboriginal life. Aspects of these spiritual and heritage values are embedded in or embodied by physical remains such as rock inscriptions, paintings, images or deposits with archaeological material remaining as evidence of past Aboriginal presence, but these are seen as an inseparable part of the present natural setting. Evidence of Aboriginal occupation has been recorded in more than forty locations in the North Head area. ;European/Asian heritage The Quarantine Station has strong associations for several groups in the community for social and cultural reasons. These associations include connections to the Aboriginal community, for whom the Quarantine Station is a component of the North Head/Manly area. This area has strong associations with previous Aboriginal ownership and use; with the impact of European settlement on the Aborigines; and through specific acts of Aboriginal resistance in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.North Head Quarantine Station also has associations with the former Quarantine Station staff, who worked on the station while it was an active quarantine; with former passengers subjected to quarantine, and their families (e.g. as exemplified by the Constitution memorial and family commemoration of their forebears' quarantine experience); and with the Manly community, as part of the wider North Head landscape, which has significantly contributed to the 'sense of place' of that community. The station also has significance to Asian immigrants or seamen who arrived in Australia and were retained at the Station. Many of these internees made their permanent home in Australia. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. ;Aboriginal heritage Aboriginal people have occupied the Sydney basin for at least 20,000 years. The Harbour has been a focus for Aboriginal habitation since its occupation over 6000 years ago. So much of the physical evidence of Aboriginal people's occupation of North Head is either undiscovered or lies outside the immediate North Head Quarantine Station Study Area. Many of the known sites have limited potential to yield new information due to the nature or state of physical preservation. However, given the limited capacity in this study for thorough archaeological assessment. It is possible that some sites or as yet undetected sites exist that might have greater potential to yield information that contributes to our understanding of Aboriginal occupation of the area. ;European/Asian heritage The surviving fabric of the place, both through its elements, components and sub-surface archaeological evidence, have considerable research value at a State level, with the potential to provide information on the operation of the Quarantine Station and of those in quarantine, and so to add to our knowledge of its history. The station is significant for its ability to educate the general public in its history. ;Natural heritage The area of North Head including the Quarantine Station is a remnant fragment containing once highly common vegetation types in the Sydney region. Many of these vegetation types and the wildlife they support are confined to disturbed remnants with the original vegetation having been cleared for urban and industrial development. Over 450 species of plants are found on North Head. Ninety species of native birds have been recorded in the Quarantine area including some species covered by international migratory bird agreements.The long period of \\"isolation\\" of North Head as a \\"tied island\\" initially allowed the species of flora and terrestrial fauna on the Head to evolve independently from those found elsewhere in the Sydney Basin. Although no longer tied, and now subject to the introduction of exotic flora and fauna, this early isolation has enhanced the value to science of the biodiversity on North Head. The response of plants and animals to periodic burning and periods without burning has potential to yield information important to the understanding of the natural history of the Hawkesbury Sandstone flora and fauna. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. ;European/Asian heritage The Quarantine Station, as NSW's primary quarantine facility for 166 years, held a unique place in the State's history, and its remarkably well preserved set of quarantine structures, landscape features and inscriptions make it a place of great rarity. The functions it fulfilled are no longer used to control quarantinable diseases, and the North Head Quarantine Station has the best representative collection of quarantine related buildings, equipment and human memorabilia [in the form of the inscriptions] of any Australian quarantine station. The moveable heritage associated with the Station; [and comprehensively documented by the NPWS] is of great cultural significance; particularly in situ within the Station. The Station is also significant in Australia's European and Asian history as being one of the few Australian sites taken into conservation ownership and management directly after its original function and use had been ended. ;Natural heritage Three species, one subspecies and populations of two other species are listed in schedules of the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. These species are the Little Penguin, Eudyptula minor (Schedule 1, endangered population, Manly); Long-nosed Bandicoot, Perameles nasuta (Schedule 1, endangered population North Head); the Sunshine Wattle, Acacia terminalis ssp terminalis (Schedule 1, endangered); Camfields Stringybark, Eucalyptus camfieldii (Schedule 2, vulnerable); the Powerful Owl, Ninox strenua (Schedule 2, vulnerable); and the Red-crowned Toadlet, Pseudophryne australis (Schedule 2, vulnerable). In addition to the threatened plant species there are over 450 other species of vascular plants and ferns representing 109 plant families. This level of genetic diversity if scientifically interesting and aesthetically pleasing. The endangered population of Little Penguin is significant as the only population of this species which breeds on the mainland of NSW. Thecharacteristics which have enabled this population to persist in one of the busiest commercial harbours in the world are interesting for scientific study. The endangered population of Long-nosed Bandicoot is also scientifically interesting as a remnant population of a species which was formerly common and widespread in the Sydney region. The few remaining trees of Camfields Stringybark are a significant component of the entire genetic resource of this vulnerable species. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Quarantine Station has the best collection of features in Australia reflecting the practise of quarantine, once operating at a number of stations around the nation. NSW had the first, and the last, operational quarantine station at North Head, and the surviving evidence at the station demonstrates many of the key milestones in quarantine development in this country. The moveable heritage of Quarantine Station is considerable in size, and has cultural significance in its own right.

H. Auden written on the outbreak of World War II. It was first published in The New Republic issue of 18 October 1939, and in book form in Auden's collection Another Time (1940). Description The poem deliberately echoes the stanza form of W. B. Yeats's \\"Easter, 1916\\", another poem about an important historical event; like Yeats' poem, Auden's moves from a description of historical failures and frustrations to a possible transformation in the present or future. Until the two final stanzas, the poem briefly describes the social and personal pathology that has brought about the outbreak of war: first the historical development of Germany \\"from Luther until now\\", next the internal conflicts in every individual person that correspond to the external conflicts of the war. Much of the language and content of the poem echoes that of C.G. Jung's Psychology and Religion (1938). The final two stanzas shift radically in tone and content, turning to the truth that the poet can tell, \\"We must love one another or die,\\" and to the presence in the world of \\"the Just\\" who exchange messages of hope. The poem ends with the hope that the poet, like \\"the Just\\", can \\"show an affirming flame\\" in the midst of the disaster. History of the text Auden wrote the poem in the first days of World War II while visiting the father of his lover Chester Kallman in New Jersey (according to a communication of Kallman to friends, see Edward Mendelson, Later Auden, p. 531). Dorothy Farnan, Kallman's father's second wife, in her biography Auden in Love (1984), wrote that it was written in the Dizzy Club, an alleged gay bar in New York City, as if the statement in the first two lines, \\"I sit in one of the dives / On Fifty-second Street,\\" were literal fact and not conventional poetic fiction (she had not met Kallman or Auden at the time). Even before printing the poem for the first time, Auden deleted two stanzas from the latter section, one of them proclaiming his faith in an inevitable \\"education of man\\" away from war and division. The two stanzas are printed in Edward Mendelson's Early Auden (1981). Soon after writing the poem, Auden began to turn away from it, apparently because he found it flattering to himself and to his readers. When he reprinted the poem in The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden (1945) he omitted the famous stanza that ends \\"We must love one another or die.\\" In 1957, he wrote to the critic Laurence Lerner, \\"Between you and me, I loathe that poem\\" (quoted in Edward Mendelson, Later Auden, p. 478). He resolved to omit it from his further collections, and it did not appear in his 1966 Collected Shorter Poems 1927‚Äì1957. In the mid-1950s Auden began to refuse permission to editors who asked to reprint the poem in anthologies. In 1955, he allowed Oscar Williams to include it complete in The New Pocket Anthology of American Verse, but altered the most famous line to read \\"We must love one another and die.\\" Later he allowed the poem to be reprinted only once, in a Penguin Books anthology Poetry of the Thirties (1964), with a note saying about this and four other early poems, \\"Mr. W. H. Auden considers these five poems to be trash which he is ashamed to have written.\\" Reception Despite Auden's disapproval, the poem became famous and widely popular. E. M. Forster wrote, \\"Because he once wrote 'We must love one another or die' he can command me to follow him\\" (Two Cheers for Democracy, 1951). \\"Daisy\\" advertisement A close echo of the line \\"We must love one another or die,\\" spoken by Lyndon Johnson in a recording of one of his speeches, was used in the famous Johnson campaign commercial \\"Daisy\\" during the 1964 campaign. In the ad, the image of a young girl picks petals from a daisy, then is replaced by the image of a nuclear explosion, which serves as an apocalyptic backdrop to the audio of Johnson's speech. Johnson's version of the line, inserted into a speech by an unidentified speechwriter, was \\"We must either love each other, or we must die.\\" A reference to the poem titles Larry Kramer's 1985 play The Normal Heart. In 2001, immediately after the 11 September 2001 attacks, the poem was read (with many lines omitted) on National Public Radio and was widely circulated and discussed for its relevance to recent events.

He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 for his columns exposing police brutality against Haitian immigrant Abner Louima. He was sued for libel by a woman he had accused of lying in her claim that she had been raped. He also wrote five books inspired by cases he had covered. McAlary died of colon cancer in 1998 at the age of 41.Martin Garbus, \\"The damage done by a 'Lucky Guy', The New York Times, April 2, 2013. Life and career Born in 1957, McAlary started his journalism career as a sportswriter in Boston. He moved to New York to fill a similar position with the New York Post. In 1985 he became a reporter for New York Newsday, the major newspaper on Long Island. He left that position to become a columnist for the New York Daily News. He also wrote columns for the Post, jumping frequently between it and the \\"Daily News\\". In 1988, McAlary wrote a non-fiction book, Buddy Boys, about corrupt police in New York's 77th Precinct, in the Brooklyn North patrol borough. He also had a hand in writing the script for the movie Cop Land, starring Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro. In 1990, McAlary wrote a piece referring to a gang leader named Lefty, who had a friend killed in city gang warfare. Four years later, McAlary interviewed Lefty anew. By then the former gang leader was a decorated soldier, family man, and college student. He attributed his about-face to McAlary's 1990 article. McAlary ended his 1994 piece by writing, \\"I am humbled by his talent. Sure, as a columnist, you can get people indicted and even free the wrongly accused. That is what you do. But from now on, I know, at least once, I wrote a story that mattered.\\" McAlary, Mike (November 14, 1994). \\"Hero builds a life after pal's death\\". Daily News.

McAlary's most controversial story, for the Daily News in 1994, was about a woman who said she had been raped while walking home with groceries through Prospect Park, in Brooklyn. Unnamed police sources told McAlary that she made up the story, because she wanted to promote a rally about violence against lesbians. McAlary's police sources said there were inconsistencies in her story, and a lack of physical evidence. The police department later discovered DNA evidence, but no arrests were made at the time. McAlary accepted the original police account of events, and wrote three columns about it, including one headlined, \\"Rape hoax the real crime.\\" The woman sued McAlary for libel, but the case was dismissed because McAlary had been relying on information from the police. In 2018, using advanced modern techniques, the New York police matched the DNA to James Edward Webb, who by then had been convicted of serial rape and was serving 75 years to life in prison for those other crimes. The statute of limitations had expired for prosecution of Webb for the 1994 Prospect Park case.\\"Police say they‚Äôve cracked rape case columnist deemed a hoax\\" By Colleen Long, (AP), Washington Post, January 9, 2018\\"New York City police solve 1994 rape case that newspaper called a hoax\\", The Guardian, 9 Jan 2018 Both the newspaper and the New York City Police have formally apologized to the woman for \\"letting her down.\\"\\"1994 Prospect Park rape victim receives apology from New York City police commissioner\\", FOX News, Oct. 29, 2018, McAlary's idols were New York journalists Jimmy Breslin, Murray Kempton, and Pete Hamill.
