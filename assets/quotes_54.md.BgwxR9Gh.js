Founded in 1882, the congregation was Greenwich's first African-American congregation of any denomination, and remains a center of African-American society in the town. Its current church, built in 1921 on the site of its first church, is a good example of Late Gothic Revival architecture, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Architecture and history The Bethel AME Church is located north of downtown Greenwich, on the south side of Lake Street opposite the Greenwich Hospital campus. It is a single-story structure, with a gabled roof and stucco exterior. A square tower projects from the front left corner, capped by a pyramidal roof with flared eaves. The main entrance is in the base of the tower, sheltered by a gabled portico. Windows on the tower and building facade are lancet-arched in the Gothic style. The church congregation was founded in 1882, forming what was then the first major focal point for African-American society in the town. The church eventually outgrew its first edifice, built on this site in 1883, and the present church was built in 1921. The congregation continues to be affiliated with the larger African Methodist Episcopal Church.

Early life and career Charles Leirens was born on March 4, 1888 in Ghent, Belgium where he undertook his primary and secondary education. Also in Ghent he received his musical education as a pianist and, at the age of 8, started giving concerts in public. He studied law at the University of Ghent for two years while also studying counterpoint and harmony and began to compose music. He married and lived in Brussels where he had a son. Music During the First World War Leirens worked for the Belgian services in London and in 1919 became the secretary of Fondation Universitaire, after which he abandoned musical composition. In 1928 he was the first Director-General of the Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, and organized exhibitions, conferences, events, all considered very brilliant, but too expensive.Wangerm√©e, R.

He had had to leave the post, as the Palais was now consigning its activities to specialized auxiliary companies. By creating La Maison d‚ÄôArt in December 1933 and initiating a vital program of concerts, lectures, exhibitions, Leirens had addressed those who perceived the Soci√©t√© Philharmonic, for example, as risk-averse and relying too exclusively on international superstars and populist works.

Previously, she served two terms as the regent of Kebumen. She was formerly a member of PDI-P, until she left the party around 2014 following her support for Prabowo Subianto in the 2014 Indonesian presidential election. Early life and education Rustriningsih was born in Kedungampel village of Kebumen, Central Java on 3 July 1967 as the eighth of ten children. Her father Sukamto was a PNI activist during the Sukarno government and, later on, was active in PDI activities. After completing her basic education, she studied in General Soedirman University's faculty of social and political sciences. While there, she once trained PDI cadres, allowing her to meet Megawati Soekarnoputri. Career =Pre-regent= After graduating from university, Rustriningsih began a catering business and a news agency, both based in her parents' house. The news agency eventually grew to employ 28 people. In political activities, she joined PDI's regional board on 1993, and by 1996 was the chief of PDI's Kebumen branch. When PDI encountered internal conflict and government intervention in 1996, Rustriningsih was a Megawati loyalist, forming sub- branches for the party and being arrested (though always later released) several times. Following the fall of Suharto, Rustriningsih became the head of Kebumen's General Elections Commission. =Regent= Rustriningsih was first elected as regent of her home regency of Kebumen in 2000 after gaining 22 votes from the municipal council to her opponent's 20. Her running mate was Nashiruddin Al-Mansyur, an influential local kyai. Throughout her first term, she focused on populist development projects supporting small-scale enterprises and was consistent in opposing corruption. She would feature every morning on Kebumen's local TV station RATIH TV in an interactive program Selamat Pagi Bupati (Good morning Regent), where she would directly answer questions about problems in Kebumen from viewers. She adopted a reformist and trustworthy image, and received an \\"Outstanding Women in Local Government\\" from UNESCAP, and was featured by CNN. In 2005, she ran for her second term in the regency's first direct local election. Sometime around 2004, she also adopted a headscarf (after going on hajj and marrying her husband), adopting a more pious image. In the following election, she won in a landslide, securing a victory in 25 out of 26 subdistricts in Kebumen. =Vice governor= During her second term as regent, Rustriningsih ran as Bibit Waluyo's running mate for the governorship of Central Java and won. The pair was sworn in on 23 August 2008. In the five-year tenure, she would attempt and fail to become the head of PDI-P's provincial board in Central Java, with her brother also losing in Kebumen's 2010 regency election. In 2013, she registered with her party to run for the governorship of Central Java. While she had significant popularity in the province, the party decided to not endorse her at the last moment. According to a Gerindra leader, she could have sought the support of other parties, but did not do so. =PDIP= Though Rustriningsih had been part of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) during the New Order, she would be appointed as a member of its consultative body in 2001. She received significant coverage in media, and received attention and funding from human rights organizations abroad due to her perceived position as member of an oppressed group. She had also become the leader of PDI-P's local office in Kebumen. For the 2014 Indonesian presidential election, Rustriningsih endorsed the Prabowo Subianto/Hatta Rajasa pair - opposed to her party, who endorsed the Joko Widodo/Jusuf Kalla ticket. Due to this, PDI-P leader Megawati Soekarnoputri called for her to leave the party, and she ended up leaving that year. Prior to this, she had also encountered some internal controversy in her party due to her status as one of the initial founders of Nasdem prior to its establishment as a political party. =Post-2014= Rustriningsih was proposed as a possible running mate to Sudirman Said in the 2018 Central Java gubernatorial election, but she ended up not running. In the election itself, the PDI-P backed candidate and incumbent Ganjar Pranowo lost in Kebumen, and the defeat was attributed to Rustriningsih's influence in the regency. She again campaigned for Prabowo in the 2019 Indonesian presidential election. Personal life Rustriningsih married Soni Achmad Saleh Ashar in 2004, and has five children (one adopted) as of February 2010.

It is a Grade II* listed building. By the year 2000, the estate had been converted into luxury apartments.Six magnificent apartments for sale in stately homes across Britain 28 March 2020 History The house was designed by George Somers Leigh Clarke for the Lancashire cotton magnate and Conservative politician Edward Hermon and was built between 1874 and 1884. Wyfold Court has a 14 window range of non-uniform material, mostly of stone mullion and transom windows with \\"elaborate carved hoods\\". The building is built of scarlet brick with blue brick diapers (geometric patterns) and yellow stone details. Its style combines the Flamboyant period of French Gothic architecture with a touch of Scots Baronial. The front fa√ßade has towers with corner turrets, gargoyles and traceried windows; its garden front has mullioned bay windows and brick gable (facing roof walls) with crocketed heraldic beasts. Indoors, the main corridor is rib vaulted with staircase hall and a multi-storey wide bay window with stained glass of royal coats of arms. In the 1970s critic Jennifer Sherwood summarised its architecture as a \\"Nightmare Abbey\\". Hermon's only daughter was Frances Caroline Hermon who married Robert Hodge. Hodge secured a seat in the Commons at the 1895 general election as MP for the Southern or Henley Division of Oxfordshire. He was created a baronet as Sir Robert Hodge of Wyfold Court in July 1902 and later ennobled as Baron Wyfold in May 1919. After his wife died in 1929, Hodge had little use for such a large house and, in 1932, he sold it to the Government who converted it for medical use as Borocourt Hospital. It joined the National Health Service in 1948. In 1981 Silent Minority, a documentary film made by Nigel Evans for ATV, highlighted the conditions of mental patients at the Borocourt Hospital and at St Lawrence's Hospital in Caterham. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the 1980s the hospital reduced in size and closed in 1993. By the year 2000, it was returned to residential use as luxury apartments.

Scientific contributions Janis is best known for her contributions to the study of ungulates (hoofed mammals). As well as a large scientific publication list, Janis has contributed widely to textbooks and popular articles. Her earlier publications examine mammal teeth. For example, ungulate teeth changed from low crowned teeth to high crowned hypsodont teeth, as they evolved to adapt to a grassland diet, and this is correlated with changes in their digestion and can be used in their taxonomy.Janis, C. 1976.

It was founded in San Francisco by the intellectual scholar and Korean Independence activist Ahn Changho, and represented the interests of Koreans in the United States, Russian Far East, and Manchuria during the Korean Independence Movement. Background Flag of Korean National Association (Seong-Mun Choi) After the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1905, multiple local and statewide Korean organizations emerged in Hawaii, California, and other parts of the US condemning Japan's colonial policies. However, on March 23, 1908, after the pro-Japanese diplomat, Durham White Stevens, was assassinated by two Korean immigrants, Korean organizations in both Hawaii and the US mainland joined together to protect the rights of the two alleged assailants. This event and the growing need to consolidate patriotic efforts led to two major Korean civic organizations, the Mutual Assistance Society (MAS) in San Francisco and United Korean Society in Hawaii, to organize a meeting on October 30, 1908, to discuss the unification of both groups. Seven representatives from Hawaii and six representatives of the mainland US made an agreement and both organizations officially merged to form the KNA on February 1, 1909.‚ÄúKorean National Association‚Äù Asian American History and Culture: An Encyclopedia, p.488 Earlier years Following its establishment, the KNA began with two regional headquarters in Hawaii and San Francisco, and expanded its activities by sending delegates to other regions to establish additional chapters. By 1911, the KNA had expanded to four key regions: North America, Hawaii, Siberia, and Manchuria. To reflect its geographic expansion, the Korean National Association changed its name to All Korea Korean National Association. Each regional headquarters administered over local chapters, and at the organization's peak, there would be nearly 130 including 38 chapters in Hawaii and 73 chapters in North America.The Quest for Statehood: Korean Immigrant Nationalism and U.S. Sovereignty, 1905-1945 p. 42 On November 8, 1912, representatives coming from all regional headquarters met in San Francisco for an All Koreans Conference to establish a KNA central headquarters. It would serve as a central administrative office to ensure uniformity of rules across all chapters and to direct Korean independence movement activities. Ahn Changho and Park Yong-man were elected as the organization's chairman and vice chairman. As the leader of the central body, Ahn continued his work organizing KNA regional branches and further strengthening and unifying the organization. Though becoming more centralized, there remained conflicting interests between key leaders in Hawaii and North America. For example, Syngman Rhee looked for liberation through education and diplomacy, while Park Yong-man preferred military action. Ahn Changho went to Hawaii to mediate between the two leaders but with little success. As an organization declaring its service as a legitimate governing body for the interests and well-being of Koreans, its state functionings was put to the test on June 13, 1914, when a group of Korean Americans working at an apricot farm in Hemet, California was attacked by local citizens who didn't want Asians working in that area. Initially, the Japanese consulate interceded with the government on behalf of the Korean Immigrants but that caused outrage within the Korean-American community. David Lee, the president of the North American branch of the KNA, sent a telegram to the US Secretary of state William Jennings Bryan, requesting that the Japanese government no longer represent Koreans. Despite the pressures from Japanese diplomats in Washington DC, Bryan ruled in the KNA's favor. Ever since, matters regarding the Korean immigrants or students would be handled by the KNA instead.Asian American: A Reader p.54 March 1st Movement The March 1st Movement in 1919 rekindled the national spirit of Korean-Americans. When news of the demonstrations reached the US in mid-March, a mass rally was held by the KNA in San Francisco. The KNA first attempted to send a three-man delegation including Syngman Rhee to the Paris Peace Conference but failed to receive necessary travel documentation. Afterwards, the KNA decided to establish a Korean Information Office headed by Philip Jaisohn then send him and Syngman Rhee to Philadelphia to lead \\"the Korean Congress\\" held from April 14 to 16 of the same year to begin blueprinting the future Republic of Korea with 150 Koreans representing 27 organizations in the US and Mexico. All organizations agreed upon a Korean republic based on democratic principles and pledged their support to the newly established Korean Provisional Government (KPG) in Shanghai. Ahn Changho, who was in Shanghai at that time, played an instrumental role in the government's establishment on April 13 and its early operations. After its formation, Syngman Rhee felt that the KNA fulfilled its goals and should let the government‚Äêin‚Äêexile lead the cause. Therefore, he proposed that the KNA rename itself to the Korean Residence Association which KNA members firmly rejected. This caused a factional split and the founding of The Comrade Society in Hawaii by Syngman Rhee and his supporters.Korean Americans in Los Angeles, 1905‚Äê1980, p.20 Despite internal conflicts, the spike in activity within the KNA continued on until the mid-1920s when it lost its steam in the liberation movement and would not regain it until the Sino- Japanese War in 1937.Koreans in Central California (1903-1957): A Study of Settlement and Transnational Politics, p.93 However, the KNA continued to launch independence funds which for the following decades collected money from Korean immigrants to financially support the provisional government and anti- Japanese activities. 1915 people's association annual convention World War II In 1936, the Korean National Association relocated its central headquarters to Los Angeles where it continued its independence activity and communication with the US government on behalf of Koreans. By that year, the KNA had become the largest Korean immigrant political organization and a key source of resistance and political empowerment, primarily through unifying the efforts of Korean immigrants and lobbying allied governments. However, the Hawaiian and North American branch of the KNA was becoming increasingly divided due to internal conflicts. It wasn't until internal reforms under KNA chairman Charles Kim and the arrival of World War II that the KNA branches united to join with other organizations such as Comrade Society to form the United Korean Committee. This alliance continued providing support for the KPG and aimed to receive official recognition of the KPG as the government of Korea. Since liberation After Korea's liberation from Japan, the KNA continued its supportive efforts for the Republic of Korea through relief efforts while promoting cultural, educational, and religious activities in Korean-American communities. The organization continued to serve the Korean- American community in the US until dissolving in 1988. After later restoration work, the KNA's former headquarter building in Los Angeles was converted into a Korean Independence Memorial Building to educate the public on Korean American history and the organization's work. In recognition of its part in shaping Korean American history, in 1991, the city of Los Angeles declared the building as a historical landmark. Organizational media 1910 issue of The New Korea (Sinhan Minbo) On February 10, 1910, the KNA published the weekly newspaper Sinhan Minbo (Ïã†ÌïúÎØºÎ≥¥), or The New Korea. Every Wednesday it published articles promoting the independence movement and advocating the interests of the Korean people. After World War II, it continued publishing weekly until being acquired by Kim Un Ha in September 1974 and published monthly instead.

The human brain's control of motor function is a mirror image in terms of connectivity; the left hemisphere controls the right hand and vice versa. This theoretically means that the hemisphere contralateral to the dominant hand tends to be more dominant than the ipsilateral hemisphere, however this is not always the case and there are numerous other factors which contribute in complex ways to physical hand preference.  Language and speech areas  Language areas are represented unilaterally in the human brain. In around 95% of right-handers, these brain areas are often located on the left hemisphere, however the proportion reduces in left handers down to around 70%. Therefore 7 in every 100 individuals is right-hemisphered for language and left-hand dominant. It is unclear as to whether or not left-hemisphered left handers suffer any language or writing deficits because of this. Broca's area has been found to have differing grey matter structures depending on handedness. The inferior frontal sulcus, which contains Broca's area, was found to be more continuous in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the dominant hand = Corpus callosum = Because the left arm is controlled by the right hemisphere and vice versa, the corpus callosum has also been found to be larger in left-handers. This is theoretically so that language comprehension and production can more efficiently move from the primary language areas into the motor areas which control the contralateral arm. No research has investigated the effect of being right-hemispheric for language whilst being left-handed, and whether or not the corpus callosum is still larger without the need to communicate across hemispheres, such would be the case in right- hemispheric left-handers. = Planum temporale = The planum temporale is a brain region within Broca's Area, and is thought to be the most asymmetric area of the human brain; with the left side having shown to be five times the size of the right in some individuals. However in people who are left handed, this asymmetry has shown to be reduced  Motor areas  Handedness correlates in motor areas have been found to be more subtle and less pronounced than language areas, but are nevertheless still detectable. = Central sulcus = The surface area of the central sulcus has been found to be larger in the dominant hemisphere, as well as the 'hand knob', an area in the primary motor cortex which is responsible for hand movements, is located more dorsally in the left hemisphere of people who are right- compared to left-handed = Right shift theory = Marian Annett devised the Right Shift Theory in 1972, which states that language areas and motor cortex development is preferential in the left hemisphere due to the theoretical gene RS+. This theory also states that there is no particular gene which causes increased right-hemispheric development compared to left, instead without the RS+ gene the development is a gaussian curve which is centralised. The presence of the RS+ gene promotes left-hemispheric dominance, in turn introducing a right-handedness bias which shifts the curve towards the right.  Corticospinal tract  The corticospinal tract is a bundle of white matter which connects the cerebral cortex with motor neurons in the spinal cord. Notably, humans show a natural asymmetry between left and right tracts, such that the left tract (and therefore connections to the right hand) is significantly larger. However this asymmetry has been found to be reduced in left-handers, suggesting a less biased connection to both hands.  Forced handedness  In order to untangle causality, some research employs a 'forced handedness' group. Left-handers who were forced during childhood to use their right hand showed a larger surface area of the central sulcus in their left hemisphere, which is associated with right-handedness. Also, structures in the basal ganglia such as the putamen also mirrored developmental right-hand dominant individuals in the forced group.  Face processing  The Fusiform Face area is an area typically unilaterally, much like the language areas, and localized on the right fusiform gyrus. However, this brain region has been found to be more bilateral in left-handers; that is the left fusiform gyrus responds more to faces in left-handers than in right-handers. However the occipital face area shows no such correlation, and so handedness is thought to impact face processing on a level in the hierarchy which does not involve the occipital face area, however does include the fusiform gyrus.  Complications  = Handedness inventory = Handedness in and of itself tends to be a grey area. The requirements for someone to be right- as opposed to left-handed have been debated, and because individuals who identify as left-handed may also use their right hand for a large number of tasks, identifying two clearcut groups of subjects is a challenging task. The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory is a common parametric test used to determine handedness, by comparing individuals to the population at large. However use of this inventory varies between researchers, and it has been criticized for its use in modern research. This means that an individual which one research group may classify as a left-hander, may be classified as ambidextrous in another; leading to difficulties in comparison between the two. = Conflicting evidence = A number of asymmetrical findings have been disputed, with various studies stating null results in opposition to previously reported differences. This is an issue in handedness neuroscience, as imaging methods are highly susceptible to type 1 errors due to the number of comparisons which they make. = Complexity of causality = The relationship between handedness and its neuronal correlates is complex. Language areas themselves are not concretely correlated, and motor area show exceedingly subtle differences. Because of this, the literature shows many differing opinions. Clearly, advances in research are still necessary to unveil true causal relationships between structural differences and their manifestation in the form of handedness.

It was designed by John Whitton as the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways and was built from 1863 to 1867 by Murnin and Brown. It is also known as Stonequarry Creek Railway Viaduct and Picton railway viaduct over Stonequarry Creek. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Picton= The town of Picton was named by Major Antill after Sir Thomas Picton in 1841. The location was previously known as \\"Stonequarry\\". The Duke of Wellington described Picton as a \\"rough foul-mouthed devil as ever lived\\" but very capable. He was \\"respected for his courage and feared for his irrascible temperament\\". He was chiefly remembered for his exploits under Wellington in the Iberinan Peninsular War displaying great barvery and persistence. He was killed at the Battle of Waterloo and was the most senior officer to die there. He was buried in the family vault at St. George's, Hanover Square in London. In 1859 Picton was re-interred in St. Paul's Cathedral, London, lying close to the body of the Duke of Wellington.Wheeldon, 2015, 3. =Railway viaduct= The Stonequarry Creek railway viaduct was built for the Picton to Goulburn railway extension, 1862-1869. John Whitton signed the plans in July 1862 but the first contractor failed so Murnin and Brown took over the contract in December 1863. The work was supervised by George Cowdery (a future Engineer- in-Chief for Existing Lines) and was opened for traffic on 28 February 1867 for the first section of extension to Mittagong. It cost A¬£10,437. It is the oldest railway arch bridge in New South Wales and the first one built for two tracks, the second is over James Street, Lithgow. Economic constraints forced Whitton to build the others for single track. They were progressively bypassed by double track brick arch bridges whereas Stonequarry Creek viaduct continues its original function. The viaduct is accessible from Menangle Street via Webster Street.  Description  A sandstone viaduct carrying the double track Main South Railway (was great Southern Railway) over Stonequarry Creek just south of Picton railway station. It is south of the station in terms of the general direction of the line, although it is actually north of the station because the line runs north at this point. There are five arches of clear span which together with pier widths and abutments gives the viaduct a total length of . The middle arch is the highest above the creek bed at . The piers are solid stone, founded at shollw depth into rock, tapering to the springing levels of the arches which are solid semi-circular, radius and thick. At the piers, the internal \\"V\\" formed by the adjoining arches is filled by stone rubble to about and dished to form a drain. There is a pipe drain down the middle which dishcharges at the springing level. By this arrangement the ballastered tracks are drained and do not get water logged. There is a low stone parapet wall on each side of the viaduct supplemented by a timber fence for the safety of train shunters. The abutments are U-shaped in plan with three internal buttresses. = Condition = As at 15 March 2006, the viaduct is in excellent condition and carries rail traffic that is considerably heavier and faster than when built. No strengthening works or modification have been necessary. The viaduct retains its original fabric and function. = Modifications and dates = There have been only minor railway attachments to suit changing operations over the years, but those that remain do not detract from the significance of the bridge.  Heritage listing  As at 15 March 2006, this 1867 viaduct is significant because it is the oldest stone arch railway bridge in New South Wales. It is associated with John Whitton the \\"father of new South Railways\\", it is an imposing sandstone structure, a landmark for the historic town of Picton, its construction contributed significantly to the subsequent railway extension to Albury in 1883 to link with the Victorian line and to the development of Southern Western new South Wales and when John Whitton was denied funds to continue with the expensive wrought iron girder bridges he chose the stone arch viaduct for his major bridge works. It has proved to be a most cost-effective structure. It is unique being the first double track stone arch viaduct and retains its original fabric and function. It represents a major technological achievement in the construction of the Great Southern Railway line by John Whitton. Picton railway viaduct over Stonequarry Creek was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. This viaduct is the oldest stone arch railway bridge in New South Wales. It is still in use without any restriction on railway operations. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. It is associated with John Whitton the \\"father of New South Wales railways\\". The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The viaduct is an imposing sandstone structure, a landmark for the historic town of Picton and a photo stop for tourist. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Its construction contributed significantly to the railway extension to Albury to link with the Victorian line and to the development of South Western New South Wales. It continues as a major item of railway infrastructure for the commercial and social wellbeing of that region and for land transport to Melbourne. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. When John Whitton was denied funds to continue with the expensive wrought iron girder bridges he chose the stone arch viaduct for his major bridge works. The former at Menangle cost ¬£94,562 whereas the Stonequarry Creek viaduct cost ¬£10,437. It has proved to be a most cost-effective structure. This viaduct was a prelude to his extensive use of stone arch viaducts across the Blue Mountains to Lithgow. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The only double track stone arch viaduct. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It is a magnificent representative example of a class of railway bridge built during 1862-69.

Biography Vedagiri Mudaliar hailed from Kalathur, originally called Ponvilaintha Kalathur, a small town near Chengalpattu in Tamil Nadu. Mudaliar taught Tamil in Madurai Tamil Sangam. He also established a printing press exclusively for the purpose of printing Tamil materials. In 1850, Mudaliar published the entire Kural text with commentaries for the first time in history. Though the work had been published with commentaries a few years earlier by Mahalinga Iyer, that work only had the first 24 chapters of the classical work published. A revised edition of the publication was released posthumously in 1853 by Mudaliar's sons Arumuga Mudaliar and Kandasamy Mudaliar. Mudaliar's work has the distinction of being used by Ramalinga Adigal, who launched a movement to teach the classic to the masses. Mudaliar had also written commentaries on the Naladiar, another ancient didactic work similar to the Kural text. Mudaliar died in 1852.

Like the Czech game of Sedma, the winner of a trick is the last one to play a card of the same rank as the led card. Players form two teams of two and thus are able to smear their partner's tricks or play blanks if they think their opponents will win the trick. The only counters are the Aces and Tens, worth 10 points each, and there are 10 more points for the last trick. The aim is thus to win 50 or more points.  Background  Lusti-Kartl'n is a point-trick game for 4 players in which the aim is to score 50 or more card points from a total of 90. Players form permanent teams of two, the partners sitting opposite one another. There are no trumps.  Cards  Lusti-Kartl'n is played with 32 cards from a Bavarian pattern pack; the Sixes are left out. The Aces and Tens are worth 10 points each; the remaining cards are non-counters. As taking the last trick earns an additional 10 points, there are 90 points to play for.  Playing  Unusually, tricks are won by the last card played that is of the same rank as the led card. So Sevens beat Sevens, Eights beat Eights, Obers beat Obers and so on. So if a Nine is led to the trick, the last Nine to be played to it wins. Players do not have to follow suit, nor do they have to follow rank. Any card may be played. Unlike, Sedma, there are no wild cards.  Scoring  The team that scores over 50 card points wins. If playing for soft score, teams receive a game point, marked by a line (Strich), for each win. If playing for hard score, they get a pre-agreed stake. If a team has not scored any card points, despite winning at least one trick, they 'stink' (stinken) and the winners score double. If a team fails to take any tricks at all they are unterm Tisch ohne Stich (\\"under the table without a trick\\") and the winners score triple. A Brand (\\"fire\\") attracts the highest score; if the trick consists of 4 cards of the same rank, it is a Brand and the game is immediately over. The team who won the Brand (i.e. by playing the last card to the trick) has won the game with 4 game points. Game is 11 points and, typically, the losers have to buy a Ma√ü of beer.

Plot  Malhar Thakar as Satya and Deeksha Joshi as Saavi are a couple who are poles apart in personality and are introduced to each other as prospective marriage partners. Saavi hated non-veg consumers to the core whereas Satya's regular diet was eating non-veg food. During their first meeting along with their parents, Saavi put a condition that she would like to live with Satya for 2 months before taking final decision about marriage. Initially Saavi's parents were against this, but she was adamant on this, else she refused to marry anyone. Eventually their parents had to agree, but kept spying on them for any unusual activities. Accordingly Saavi gets shifted to Satya's House with his parents for 2 months. Saavi was a veterinarian and loved animals a lot. Their 2 months go on with some sweet moments. However, in a family function, Saavi noticed non-veg food being cooked inside and gets angry on Satya. Satya also gets upset that he cannot serve veg food to everyone, and told that he changed his habits just because of Saavi's request. As a result, both get into a heated argument and get upset with each other. Satya realised his mistake, and visits Saavi's animal clinic and started spending time with all the animals there. Saavi notices this and realises that Satya felt bad about his non-veg habit. Finally they both again patch up and marry each other.

PCAM systems are often part of a pre-collision system available in several high end car manufacturers, such as Volvo and Mercedes and Lexus, and used less widely in lower end cars such as Ford and Nissan. Yanagisawa, M., Swanson, E., Azeredo, P., & Najm, W. G. (2017, April). Estimation of potential safety benefits for pedestrian crash avoidance/mitigation systems. (Report No. DOT HS 812 400). Washington, DC: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. As of 2018 using 2016 data, more than 6,000 pedestrians and 800 cyclists are killed every year in the US in car crashes. Effective systems deployed widely could save up to 50% of these lives. More than 270,000 pedestrians are killed every year in the world. An excellent analysis of technology capabilities and limitations is provided in Death of Elaine Herzberg. Pedestrian safety has traditionally taken a secondary role to passenger safety.  Availability  Typically, PCAM systems are part of the technology in self-driving cars such as the Tesla Autopilot and use an integrated forward-facing camera and radar or lidar system designed to help mitigate or avoid a frontal crash. However, PCAM technologies do not require self-driving technologies, just cameras and radar. Sometimes, these can be enhanced with the addition of low-light detection for pedestrians and bicycles. The Nissan Leaf provides some PCAM capabilities in a commercial vehicle, but most manufacturers do not. For the 2019 model year, two Subaru models the Outback wagon and related Legacy sedan will join the redesigned Forester and Ascent SUVs to include the automaker's EyeSight crash-avoidance system as standard equipment. Subaru was one of the earliest adopters of a PCAM system (EyeSight) which is in phase III. Key players operating in the global PCAM market as of 2016 include Audi AG, Volvo Car Corporation, Continental AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, Toyota Motor Corporation, ZF Friedrichshafen AG, Autoliv Inc., Mobileye N.V., Subaru Corporation, Valeo, Honda Motor Co., Ltd., General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Daimler AG, Denso Corporation, Nissan Motor Corporation, BMW AG, and Magneti Marelli SpA. The PCAM market in North America is projected to reach US$1,997.3 million by 2025.https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/market-insight/automotive- pedestrian-protection-systems-pps-market-1380 In 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officially announced that automakers in the U.S. have to include the autonomous emergency braking system as a standard feature for all cars and trucks by 2022: this is a key component of PCAM. A detailed explanation for manufacturers offering emergency braking as part of a pre-collision system and often PCAM is provided in Collision avoidance system.  Functions  Under certain conditions, if the PCAM systems determine that the possibility of a frontal crash with a pedestrian or bicyclist is high, it prompts the driver to take evasive action and brake by using an audio and visual alert. If the driver notices the hazard and brakes, the system may use some sort of brake assist to provide additional braking force. If the driver does not brake in a set time and the PCAM determine that the risk of collision with a pedestrian or bicycle is extremely high, the system may automatically apply the brakes, reducing speed to help mitigate the impact or avoid the collision entirely if possible. Usually, this is a setting the driver must make to initiate earlier, but it can be the default.  Technology  In order to recognize a pedestrian, the computational system uses AI pattern recognition technology that typically uses machine learning and deep convolutional neural networks based on millions of images.Lienhard Pfeifer. Shearlet Features for Pedestrian Detection. July 2018. Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision.DOI: 10.1007/s10851-018-0834-9 In a simplified description, images from the car's camera and radar are compared to the prototypes stored in the computer. If a match is made and confirmed, the other systems in the PCAM are invoked.http://www.pitt.edu/~budny/papers/8156.pdfhttps://www.ijcaonline.org/research/volume127/number2/dixit-2015-ijca-906327.pdf PCAM technologies can be improved with additional information from connected vehicles.https://www.pcb.its.dot.gov/eprimer/module13.aspx A thorough description of the processes for pedestrian detection in about 2010 is provided in .

Its thorax is reddish-brown, with a dark green metallic reflex. There is a narrow oblique stripe on each side in citron-yellow. Abdomen is black, with the yellow annules narrower compared to Macromia indica. Segment 2 has a very narrow sub-basal annule which is broadly interrupted each side sub-dorsally. Segment 3 has a narrow annule. Segments 4 and 5 have a pair of small dorsal spots at the jugal suture. Segment 6 usually unmarked. Segment 7 has a basal annule. Segments 8 and 9 are unmarked. Segment 10 has a mid-dorsal carina as in Macromia indica. Anal appendages are black. It can be distinguished from M. indica by the very different markings of abdomen. These abdominal markings are similar to those of M. ellisoni; but that insect has a well-marked citron-yellow humeral stripe which is very narrow here.

It will be located in a new building in the gardens of the Campo del Moro park next to the Almudena Cathedral and the Royal Palace. It is intended to house, for public display, paintings, sculptures, tapestries, luxury objects, carriages and other works of art and historical pieces that the different kings of Spain were treasuring throughout history. History The origin of the museum dates back to the 1930s, when a first project began in 1935 and the Foundation Decree of the Museum of Arms and Carriages was issued in 1936 by the government of the Second Republic, when the president was Manuel Aza√±a. The start of the Civil War paralyzed the project, which was resumed, although not materialized, in 1950 and 1980. National Heritage (Patrimonio Nacional) again raised the idea of building the museum in 1998, retaking the idea of creating a new carriage museum but also exposing the works of art, jewelry and tapestries of the dynasties that reigned in Spain in recent centuries, the Habsburgs and the Bourbons. In 2002, the project presented by the architects Emilio Tu√±√≥n and Luis Moreno Mansilla (Mansilla + Tu√±√≥n) won the ideas contest for the building, and finally construction started in 2006. The works suffered delays due to the discovery of archaeological remains in the zone, and in addition the central government had to increase considerably the budget destined initially to the work. The main fa√ßade is finished in granite of the Gris Quintana type. This project uses stones of great dimensions that had to be emptied in its interior to cover the structure of reinforced concrete. The placement of these large pieces was a very complex task for which a custom-made tool had to be created, which translated into a laying of the first stone as a decisive act. Also made in the same granite solid steps, rain gutter, large caps and bespoke tops. The construction of the building was completed in 2016, but because of the caretaker status of the government after the 2016 general election, it could not sign the contract of extra 25 million to finish the interior of the building and the opening was delayed to 2020. In October 2018, after a year of delays, a temporal union of companies formed by Empty and Telef√≥nica won the public contest to decorate and manage the museum and its collections. Awards The building of the museum has received two main awards: * The Spanish Architecture Award 2017. * The FAD Awards for Architecture and Interior Design 2017.

It will replace the current Karuma Bridge, which was built in 1963. Location The bridge would be located at Karuma Falls, across the Victoria Nile, immediately west and downstream of the old Karuma Bridge. This is approximately , by road, north of Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city. It is located on the Kampala‚ÄìGulu Highway, approximately , by road, south of Gulu, the largest city in the Northern Region of Uganda. The coordinates of the New Karuma Bridge are 02¬∞14'35.0\\"N, 32¬∞14'22.0\\"E (Latitude:2.243056; Longitude:32.239444). History The current Karuma Bridge (the old bridge) was constructed in 1963, one year after Uganda attained independence from Britain. The old bridge is a narrow, one carriageway without pedestrian or bicycle lanes and no monitoring equipment. The bridge has been the site of several major accidents. The proposed new bridge would be modeled after the New Jinja Bridge in the Eastern Region of Uganda. A suspended cable bridge, with bicycle/motorcycle lanes is being considered. The feasibility studies and technical designs for the new bridge have been concluded. The Japan International Cooperation Agency has indicated interest in the project, although it has not confirmed willingness to fund it. Construction Construction commencement is contingent on securing a government down-payment and development partner counter-funding. Construction costs In 2017, NBS Television reported that the estimated cost of the new bridge was in excess of US$100 million.

Dao is a Vietnamese-American fantasy author. She is best known for her debut novel, Forest of a Thousand Lanterns, an East Asian-inspired retelling of the Evil Queen legend from Snow White, and its sequel Kingdom of the Blazing Phoenix.  Early life and education  Dao was born and grew up in upstate New York, the oldest child of Vietnamese immigrants. She studied pre-med biology in college, but decided not to go into the field.  Career  In 2016, Dao received a three-book deal from Philomel Books, an imprint of Penguin Books. Forest of a Thousand Lanterns, the first novel in the Rise of the Empress duology, was published in 2017. The young adult (YA) dark fairy tale retelling of Snow White explores the perspective of the Evil Queen and her dark path to the throne. The book received two starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, which called the book a \\"fascinating examination of destiny, responsibility, and how choices shape a person\\", and Booklist, which named Forest of a Thousand Lanterns in its lists of Top 10 Diverse Fiction for Older and Middle Readers and Top 10 First Novels for Youth. Rebecca Kuss, writing for Booklist, described Xifeng as an antiheroine whose \\"relentless pursuit of power is a welcome contrast to princesses of the past\\". The New York Public Library recognized the book as one of its 2017 Best Books for Teens, and it was named a Junior Library Guild Selection. Forest of a Thousand Lanterns has been optioned for television by NBC Universal. In 2018, Dao published the companion novel to Forest of a Thousand Lanterns, titled Kingdom of the Blazing Phoenix. The second book in the Rise of the Empress duology continues the story from the perspective of an exiled princess determined to take back her rightful throne. The book received the honor of Junior Library Guild Selection and garnered a starred review from School Library Journal, which wrote that \\"the importance of storytelling and of family, biological and chosen, will resonate deeply with readers.\\" Booklist called the characters \\"complex and intriguing; villains are admirably drawn so the reader sees their path,\\" and Eric Smith of Paste also praised Dao's \\"beautiful writing and imaginative storytelling.\\" In 2019, Dao published her third novel, Song of the Crimson Flower, set in the same world as the Rise of the Empress duology, about a nobleman's daughter who must make amends to the would-be lover she cruelly rejected by freeing him of a witch's curse. The book was named a 2019 Junior Guild Library Selection, as well as one of Bank Street College of Education's Best Children's Books of the Year. Of the novel, Publishers Weekly said \\"Dao‚Äôs latest fuses beats of Cyrano de Bergerac with elements from her Rise of the Empress duology to create an East Asian‚Äìinfluenced tale of love, greed, politics, addiction, and found family,\\" while School Library Journal predicted that \\"this will appeal to lovers of fairy-tale retellings and new fantasy worlds.\\" In October 2020, Dao will publish Broken Wish, the first in a quartet in which each book will be written by a different YA author and published by Disney Hyperion. The series will explore an intricate curse that ties characters together across time and continent.

The name \\"PB18\\" refers to the 2018 Pebble Beach Automotive Week in Monterey, California, where the PB18 e-tron debuted. In January 2019, Audi confirmed that 50 examples will make their way to production within the next two years.  Specifications  The PB18 e-tron is powered by 3 electric motors, 1 on the front axle and 2 on the rear axle, sending power to all 4 wheels. It produces a combined and of torque, with the capability to \\"overboost\\" to for short periods. It uses a low-mid mounted 95kWh solid-state battery with an 800-volt charging capacity that Audi claims has a range of and can charge to full capacity in 15 minutes. It supports conventional charging as well as Audi Wireless Charging (AWC) using a charging pad which can attach to the floor of a garage. Audi also claims a 0-62 mph (100 km/h) acceleration time of around 2 seconds. It also features an unconventional interior that allows the driver convert between a single-seater, central driving position and a conventional two-seater configuration with the driver on the left and a single fold down passenger seat on the right. This is made possible because the PB18 uses a drive by wire system, in which the main driving functions are controlled by the onboard computers. The PB18 provides 16.6 cubic feet of storage from its hatchback bodystyle. It also features 22 inch wheels, carbon disc brakes and adaptive magnetic ride shock absorbers.

Described as the worst serial killer known in Switzerland since the Second World War, 11 murders were attributed to him, all of them carried out in the same way: he would take young teenage hitchhikers, tie them up, violate or sexually abused them, then finally kill them and burn the corpses afterwards. These crimes upset all of Switzerland for many months and even after that, since in 2004, more than 15 years after the events, Peiry returned to the debate when the people had to decide on a popular initiative concerning the treatment of violent offenders in the country.  Murders  The first crime attributed to Michel Peiry dates back to September 1, 1981, when the-then 22-year-old traveled to the United States. There he met a young Canadian named Sylvestre, who soon disappeared without a trace. Peiry initially confessed to the murder, then retracted his claim, and finally reacknowledged it. Subsequently, he would go back and forth between confessions and retractions for all his other crimes. On February 4, 1984, Peiry murdered a young man named Fr√©d√©ric in the Annecy region of France. In June 1985, he murdered his only female victim, a woman named Anne-Laure (or possibly Anne-Fleur, as Peiry could not exactly remember her name) in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, Camargue. On May 7, 1986, Peiry killed his first Swiss victim, a young man named C√©dric, whose decomposing corpse was found in Albinen, an isolated region of Valais. In July 1986, Michel Peiry made trips to several European countries, including Yugoslavia. He admitted to the murder of a man named Silvio in the region in Rijeka (present-day Croatia), before retracting his confession. In the night between August 14 to 15, 1986, in the canton of Ticino, he came across the young hitchhiker Fabio V., killing him in his usual method. In November of the same year, Peiry attacked a man named Yves Ath. in Neuch√¢tel, who miraculously survived, despite suffering sexual abuse and almost dying. Another victim, the young Vincent, was found burned in March 1987. Links were with Pierre Chanal, but never proven. Peiry was suspected in the so-called Mourmelon disappearance case, especially since between 1980 and 1987, Peiry frequented the military zones of northern France, and the Valdahon camp in Doubs near the Swiss border. Due to a lack of evidence, this lead was abandoned in 1990. A month later, on April 16, 1987, a young Frenchman became his ninth victim, in the Como region of Italy. Peiry confessed to his murder, but then retracted the confession. Finally, on April 24, 1987, he attacked his last victim, a young man named Thomas, who survived. Michel Peiry was arrested on May 1, 1987 while doing his military service in the canton of Bern, and was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment by the court. Peiry was arrested a few days after the disappearance of 19-year-old Patrick Gache, a conscript of the 4th Regiment of Dragoons Mourmelon. No investigation or evidence could be established. In July 1988, Pierre Chanal was arrested in Dijon during a flagrant rape of Hungarian tourist. He worked as a sergeant at the Valdahon military camp in Franche-Comt√© between 1965 and 1977 for the 30th Regiment of Dragoons, regularly taking part in tank maneuvers around the camp. Between 1999 and 2000, a survey of the gendarmes in Besan√ßon established that two soldiers had disappeared between 1975 and 1977 in Valdahon. However, no connection could be made to either Peiry or Chanal. In 2002 and again in 2009, Peiry made several parole requests, without any success.Michel Peiry \\"The Sadist of Romont\\"  Modus operandi  Peiry corresponds perfectly to the typical portrait of an organized psychopath. Despite having an unhappy childhood and a violent father, he managed to lead a normal life, and was appreciated by everybody in his social life and work. However, behind the \\"mask of normality\\", he was tortured, first by his repressed homosexuality, then by violent fantasies, which he acquired early. By his own admission, he discovered his sexuality through a review of bondage: in his mind, sexuality and violence became in inseparable. In France, he is often compared to Pierre Chanal, as they were very similar.  References   Bibliography  * Janick Pont: Michel Peiry: Sexual impulses obscure to crime, Montreux, S.

It was captured and destroyed in Seljuk sultan Muhammad Tapar's anti-Nizari campaign. Its conspicuous, picturesque ruins lie about 8km south of Isfahan on a subpeak of Mount Soffeh. History Dizkuh was a fortress in central Persia, located in the strategic route leading to Isfahan, capital of the Seljuq Empire. The historian Ibn al-Athir attributes the construction of the fortress (which he called the \\"Fortress (qal'a) of Isfahan\\") to the Seljuq sultan Malikshah, but it is more likely that it dates back earlier, even as early as the pre-Islamic Sasanian period, and the Seljuq sultan simply rebuilt the castle which was near his capital. Since then, the name Shahdiz became more common. The castle gained its fame due to the activities of the Nizari Ismailis. The Ismailis were active in the Isfahan region in the 11th century, and the chief da'i of Persia and Iraq Abd al-Malik ibn Attash had established his headquarters at Isfahan. After Hassan-i Sabbah's capture of the Alamut Castle, Abd al-Malik ibn Attash's son, Ahmad ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Attash was encouraged to seize the castle. He posed as a schoolmaster and gradually converted the garrison force of the fortress, most of whom were of Daylami origin with Shiite tendencies. By 1100, he had seized the fortress and began its re-fortification similar to the other Ismaili castles of Persia. Ahmad began to collect taxes from nearby districts. He had reportedly converted 30,000 people in Isfahan. Shahdiz was strategically important as it guarded the main route to Isfahan, the Seljuq capital city. Its capture had been a major strategic success for the Nizaris. =Siege of Shahdiz= In 1107, soon after gaining power, Seljuq sultan Muhammad I Tapar, son of Malikshah, began a campaign against the Nizari Ismailis, focusing on Shahdiz, besieging the fortress with a large force. In an attempt to lift the siege, Ahmad tried to involve the Ismaili sympathizers in the Seljuq camp and the Sunni religious scholars (ulama) of Isfahan in a long religious debate, trying to convince them that the Ismailis are true Muslims, too, differing only in the matter of imamate; therefore, sultan's campaign is religiously illegitimate. The debate finally ended after a year and the siege continued. In another negotiation initiated by the Seljuq sultan, the Nizaris bargained for another fortress, but this negotiation was unsuccessful and ended with a fida'i attacking and wounding a particularly anti-Nizari commander (amir) of the Seljuq sultan. Later, an agreement was reached: part of the garrison to be given a safe passage to other Ismaili castles in Arrajan and Quhistan, and the remainder, around eighty men in all, who held only a wing of the fortress, was to surrender and then go to Alamut after receiving the news of the arrival of their fellow Ismailis. This news was received, but Ahmad refused to leave the fortress, apparently deciding to fight to the end. The Seljuqs attacked the fortress, and Ahmad and his small group of fighters defended themselves gallantly from tower to tower. Most of the Ismaili fighters were killed, while a few managed to escape. Ahmad was captured, while his wife committed suicide. Ahmad and his son were executed and their heads were sent to the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mustazhir in Baghdad. The castle was demolished by the Seljuq sultan, who feared its recapture by the Ismailis. Apparently, the Khanlanjan fortress, a nearby Ismaili stronghold, was also destroyed during this campaign. The Nizari Ismailis therefore lost their influence in the Isfahan region.

Following Thai tradition, Wongsa Dhiraj Snid spent much of his early life learning statecraft, administration, and Buddhist teachings. He was ordained as a Buddhist monk as a young man. During his time as a monk, he was mentored by an uncle, Paramanuchitchinorot, the future Supreme Patriarch of Thailand. It is believed (though not known for certain) that he served an apprenticeship to learn traditional Thai medicine as well.  Medical practice  Wongsa Dhiraj Snid followed the footsteps of his maternal family and became a physician, serving as the royal physician during the reigns of Rama III and Rama IV. He was first appointed chief of the Department of Royal Physicians at the age of 34. Though he was trained in traditional Thai medicine, he quickly adopted more Western forms of practice. He compiled a textbook of Thai medicinal herbs in a scientific style, and was the first Thai physician to utilize quinine in the treatment of malaria. He was granted honorary membership by a number of medical societies in both Europe and the United States.  Diplomacy and war  Wongsa Dhiraj Snid's court duties were not confined to the practice of medicine; he also served as a diplomat and even a field commander. During the Burmese‚ÄìSiamese War (1849‚Äì55), he led the Siamese forces that attacked Kengtung in 1854. He was one of the five Thai plenipotentiaries sent to negotiate the Bowring Treaty with the United Kingdom in 1855.

In 2008 it opened its main gallery space in Mexico City in the San Miguel Chapultepec neighborhood and in 2018 it opened a project space in New York City.  History  Kurimanzutto was conceived by Gabriel Orozco, Jos√© Kuri and M√≥nica Manzutto in 1999 and was initially founded as a nomadic enterprise. Econom√≠a de Mercado, the first exhibition by Kurimanzutto was held at the Mercado de Medell√≠n market place in Mexico City at a rented fruit stall on August 21st, 1999. The works had been made by a group of artists including Abraham Cruzvillegas, Dami√°n Ortega, Daniel Guzm√°n, Eduardo Abaroa, Fernando Ortega, Gabriel Kuri, Gabriel Orozco, Minerva Cuevas, Sof√≠a T√°boas and Rirkrit Tiravanija; with materials found in the market and were sold for prices similar to those of general produce. The exhibition only lasted one day. From 2000 to 2003 Kurimanzutto produced more that twelve different projects in distinct locations. In 2002, Jonathan Hern√°ndez chose the International Airport in Mexico City to show Traveling without moving. Minerva Cuevas presented Dodgem at a local popular fair, the project consisted in a bumper car installation in which all the cars were decorated with a petrol brand company's logo. Other places where exhibitions were held were parking lots, trailer containers, restaurants and M√≥nica and Jos√©'s apartment. Los Manantiales restaurant in Xochimilco hosted Elephant Juice (Sexo entre amigos), in 2003, a proposal by Dami√°n Ortega which consisted in a labyrinth made of tubular structures divided for each participating artist to intervene. The space was designed by the architect Mauricio Rocha and it contained drawings, photographs, painting, installations, videos, sculptures and even a pole dancer performance act. In 2003, Gabriel Orozco was invited as guest curator for the 50th Venice Biennale. The artist invited Dami√°n Ortega, Daniel Guzm√°n, Abraham Cruzvillegas, Fernando Ortega, Jean-Luc Moul√®ne and Jimmie Durham, to complete a series of conditions for the creation of the works that would be exhibited: they would not be able to present photographs, videos or drawings, they couldn't hang thinks on the walls nor use pedestals or vitrines. The creative exercise under these conditions was titled Everyday Altered. = San Miguel Chapultepec gallery space = In 2008 an ancient lumberyard was transformed into the gallery's main exhibition space in Mexico City. The building dating from the 1950s was refurbished and redesigned by the architect Alberto Kalach. The Gallery is located at Gobernador Rafael Rebollar 94 in the San Miguel Chapultepec neighborhood of Mexico City.

The architecture uses bricks, woods and stone as raw materials, timber frames as significant structures. The bearing structure is a wooden beam, and parapet walls are made of bricks, rocks, and soils. The central room is decorated with painted beams, sculpted roof, and carved eaves with skylights. The technical features and style of Hui-style architecture majorly occur in residential houses, ancestral temples, joss houses, archways, memorial gates, and gardens. The architecture reflects mountainous features of the area and a geomantic omen of traditional Chinese religions.JiaMa: SouthArchitecture. Vol.10(2006), p.102-104, in Chinese.  Origin of name  The word Hui refers to the historical prefecture of Huizhou (or Hui Prefecture) in Anhui Province, which is famous for its merchants. During the period of Ming and Qing Dynasty (about 300 years), the commodity business was mainly dominated by the Huizhou merchants, in Qing Dynasty, Huizhou merchants monopolized the salt-trading industry in China, which made them become peak famous through the country. After they become rich, they go back to Anhui to show off their fortunes and glorify their family name by purchasing lands, squandering consumption, and building luxurious residential houses, gardens, colleges, temples, and memorials. These architectures shared a specific local style with rational layouts and sophisticated decorations. There is also a tradition of carving and drawing decoration among the local folks, which contributed a lot to the unique style of the brick, wood, and stone decorations of the architectures. As a result, Hui-style architecture has become one of the major factions of traditional Chinese architecture.  Layout  = Crossing-hall layout = This layout is also called loop-hall layout. The crossing-hall is located behind the major hall and intimately connected with the considerable hall. It is the transitional space between the major hall and the inner rooms. The pavement is usually wood material. The entrance is at both left and right side of the major hall. The crossing-hall has typically three rooms, one bright lounge with illuminating patio and two rooms for temporary using. = Central-hall layout = The central hall is illuminated by three openings (front, right, and left) which are separated by moving screens for winter warming and privacy. Most central halls face to the major patio and have two corridors connecting to other rooms. There are screen doors in the front of the central hall, and the middle part of the door is usually closed. In daily manners, users enter the hall from sides. If there is a formal activity, the users can use the middle door. There are guest rooms under the patio area. The central hall is mainly used for official celebrations, guest meetings and daily activities of the owners, the hall is considered as the major part of the architecture.Black tiles and White walls  Architecture features  The structure is much into courtyard type, facing south commonly and surrounded by the river and mountain. The layout is divided symmetrically by the central axis. The central hall locates in the middle, and the rooms are on two sides. The front of the central chamber is called \\"patio,‚Äù which functions for lighting and ventilation. The appearance of residential integrity is solid with closed tall bounding walls, horse head warping, black tiles, and white walls. In adornment respect, mostly use brick, wood, stone carvings craft. = Structure = Hui-style architecture takes brick, wood, and stone as raw materials, and mainly uses a wooden frame. The beam is always built on a big scale and pays attention to decorate. The middle part of the beam slightly arched, so it is commonly known as \\"Chinese watermelon beam,\\" with Ming dynasty or Qing dynasty patterns carved on both ends. The middle section of the beam is often carved a variety of patterns, and the whole beam is designed to be magnificent and gorgeous. The material used for the vertical column is also bulky, and the upper part is slightly thin. The columns of Ming dynasty are usually spindle-shaped, most of them are carved with patterns. Girder does not apply color paint commonly but China wood oil. Patio, balusters, and screen walls are made of bluestones, red sandy stones or granite, which are cut into stone bars, and usually use natural textures of stone materials to combine into carving patterns. The wall uses small black bricks until the horse head wall. = Decoration = The hui-style architecture also widely used brick, wood, stone carving, showing a high level of decorative art. The brick carving inlaid mostly on door covers, window lintels, and side walls. Vivid figures, fish, flowers, birds, and patterns are carved on the big black bricks. Wood carving plays a significant role in ancient residential houses with extensive content. There are many themes, such as traditional operas, folk stories, myths, and legends, as well as life scenes such as fishing, farming, feasting traveling and dancing. These wood carvings are not painted but require a high quality of wood natural colors and textures. Wood Window Carving Stone carvings mainly manifest in the ancestor halls, temples, memorial archways, towers, bridges and residential doorways, pools, flower tables, window leakage, pillars, stone lions, and so on. The content is mostly the auspicious dragon and Phoenix, the crane, the tiger, the lion, the elephant, and the auspicious cloud. Techniques are mainly relief, openwork carving, round carving, and so on. = Horse-Head Wall = Horse-head wall referred to the wall which was between and higher than the two gable roof walls. Since its appearance was like a galloping horse, the wall was called horse-head wall. One of the main features of the Hui-style architectures was the broad range adoption of hose-like wall among the Hui-style architectures. Brick and wood were the main features of Hui-style architecture; while the main failure features of these architectures were the poor fire-proof performance. In ancient times, the firefighting was undeveloped. Once a building fired, it was straightforward that the nearby building burned. To prevent the spreading of fire, the ancient Huizhou residents created the Horse-like wall which could cut off fire effectively; just because of this, the horse-like wall was also known as fire seal wall. Horse-like Wall The height of the horse-head wall varied from high to low, and typically, it had the two-lap wall or three-lap wall. The horse-head wall had various types, such as the ‚ÄòMagpie Tail Type,‚Äô the ‚ÄòPrint Bucket Type,‚Äô the ‚ÄòSit Kiss Type‚Äô and others. The ‚ÄòMagpie Tail Type‚Äô referred to using the magpie tail shaped bricks as the corner of the horse-head wall. The ‚ÄòPrint Bucket Type‚Äô referred to using the bucket type bricks as the corner of the horse-head wall. Those bucket type bricks were fired from kiln printed with ‚ÄúÂçê.‚Äù The ‚ÄòSit Kiss Type‚Äô referred to using zoomorphic ornaments as the corner of the horse-head wall. All of these beautiful horse-head walls well symbolized the wisdom of ancient Huizhou people, as well as the characteristic feature of Hui-style architecture. = Patio = Patio referred to the open space enrolled by the rooms and rooms or walls among the Hui-style architectures which were used to store rainwater and drainage when it rained. Most of the Hui-style architectures were built with patios due to the business tradition. According to the geomantic theory of Huizhou businesspeople, water was the resource of money. It was the businessmen‚Äôs taboo that the financial resources would flow to the outside, so the water was better that did not rush to the outside. The patio could prevent the pool which was through the roof ridge flow to the outside, and guarantee the water flow to the patio along the trench. This phenomenon was ensured that all water from the four sides collected to the patio which meant that the financial resources would not flow to the outside. The people of Huizhou had the tradition of a large family which said that when a new couple married, they just lived with the old generation and the young generation. The original house was connected with the old one, and with the separated patio. Gradually, all these houses formed a large building. Among the residential buildings of the wealthy and influential family, there could be many patios. It was said that for those wealthy and influential family, the residential buildings could have thirty-six patios or seventy-two patios. The patio was not completely superstition and without any practical usage. Considering the layout, the patio was the center inside the Hui-style architecture, which made the room with sufficient light, well air circulation, and convenient drainage. = White Walls and Black Tiles = White Walls and Black Tiles. Regarding color, the Hui-style architecture adopted white wall, grey brick, and black tile, which inspired people with the sense of pure, fresh, and simple. After the ingenious arrangement of the three colors by Huizhou people, the whole of the building composed a beautiful piece of music with a series of jumpy note with musical composition and manifest features.

Violet Friend was the Ministry of Supply rainbow code for an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system developed in the United Kingdom. The project began in 1954 with study contracts for an early warning radar system, which was followed by the February 1955 release of Air Staff Target 1135 (AST.1135) calling for a system to counter intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) being fired at the UK from eastern Europe. AST.1135 required the system to be able to attack six targets at once and be ready for initial deployment in 1963. After many changes, due both to technical progress and changes in the strategic mission, in 1958 an \\"interim\\" design emerged that used existing missiles and radars to lower development costs. The concept used AMES Type 85 radars in East Anglia for long-range early detection as soon as the missiles rose above the radar horizon. Initial tracking of the warheads would then be handed off to AN/FPS-16 radars in the UK and the Netherlands. As they approached the UK, track information from the FPS-16 would direct an AMES Type 86 fire control radar to begin illuminating each selected target. The enemy warheads would be attacked by a nuclear-armed Bloodhound Mk. 3, with interceptions taking place between . Due to the short flight times of the ballistic missiles and relatively slow speeds of the Bloodhound, the Bloodhound had to be launched within 30 seconds of the initial early warning. The Bloodhound would at first fly under direct radio control from the ground while the warhead was still too far to be illuminated, and would then do a \\"jerk\\" manoeuvre onto the target trajectory once the Type 86 picked it up. The project took place during an extended debate about the nature of the defence, ongoing since 1947. By the late 1950s, the plan was to move the deterrent from the V bomber fleet to the silo-based Blue Streak IRBM. It was believed the Soviets would be able to directly attack these by about 1970, and an ABM would be needed to retain the deterrent. Protecting the silos required a new ABM with improved performance, but the cancellation of the Blue Streak in 1960 ended much of the system's raison d'√™tre. Ongoing concerns about the size of the Soviet missile fleet and the use of radar decoys led to serious questions about any system's effectiveness. Development largely wound down in 1960, and was formally abandoned in 1965. History =Early studies= The UK became the first nation to be subject to attack by ballistic missiles when V-2 missiles began falling on London in 1944. At the time, some consideration was given to attacking them with huge barrages of anti-aircraft artillery fire, but some calculations suggested that dud rounds falling back to the ground presented a greater threat than the missile warheads. In the immediate post- war era, Henry Tizard was once again called upon to consider the topic of air defence. Promoted to lead the new Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC), in 1947 he noted: \\"there is no more likelihood of active defence against rockets of the V.2 type (once they are launched) than there is of defence against a long-range shell.\\" He went to an outside source for a second opinion, which was produced by the Atomic Energy Study Group at Chatham House. They reached similar conclusions, suggesting guns and counter-rockets might \\"do something... But the proportion brought down could scarcely be considerable.\\" They suggested the only solution was some sort of radio-based weapon. Tizard concluded that \\"there is none, and no sign of any, practicable defence being developed as yet.\\" and ultimately suggested spending no effort on the issue. The Air Ministry continued to consider the issue and published something of a counter-note to Tizard's report. They noted that the existing Chain Home radars, then undergoing refits as part of the ROTOR system, could provide 2 to 3 minutes warning of an attack from a short-range weapon like the V-2. They also re-considered the topic of AA-guns against missiles, suggesting that modern radars might reduce the number of rounds required to kill a warhead from as much as 1.5 million to as \\"few\\" as 18,000. This was not unlike the number needed to bring down a bomber at the start of World War II. Nevertheless, they concluded a guided missile was the only real solution, and with those still years off, the only practical solution was to keep the ballistic missiles out of range, deep in Europe. =Continuing study= In May 1952, as part of a wide review by the Chief of the Air Staff and their counterparts in the British Army, it was agreed that the RAF would be responsible for providing early warning of ballistic missiles. A short time later, the DRPC's Guided Weapons Sub-committee was asked to consider \\"a GW for defence against V.2 type of attack.\\" This was followed by the Ministry of Supply's Guided Weapons Advisory Board forming a subcommittee to more seriously consider the issue in early 1953. The committee concluded that early warning could be improved to 4 to 5 minutes and that this would reduce the casualties in an attack on London from 118,000 to 30,000. Considering the incoming warheads, they concluded that they could be successfully attacked with conventional high explosive weapons. But they lacked any significant information on the radar signatures for tracking and guidance, passing that topic back to the DRPC. Studies of an actual interceptor rocket were put off until this could be better understood. As part of the \\"Ally\\" conference from 18 to 20 February 1953, the UK and US both presented papers on the topic of missile defence. The US concluded that attacking an ICBM was beyond current capabilities, and came to the same conclusion as the UK in terms of radar signatures. The UK paper considered only the V.2 type missiles, and concluded that the only solution to tracking the missile with the required accuracy was to use semi-active radar homing and that interceptions beyond about were unlikely. They also concluded that the warhead could be easily modified to strengthen it against attack, noting: =Increasing concern= In spite of this continual, and international, stream of negative reviews on ABMs, in March 1954 another review by the DRPC noted that the issue was becoming more urgent. Once again they stated that while the active interception remained an area of great uncertainty, there were areas, especially radar, where useful work could begin immediately. By this time, the newly-renamed Royal Radar Establishment (RRE) had begun work on radar and infrared detectors that suggested the warning time might be increased to as much as 15 minutes against an attack from a missile with range. A major report by the Air Defence Committee (ADC) in January 1955 stated that short-range missiles were already available to the Soviets and that the UK would come within range of longer- ranged weapons by about 1960. These were apparently references to the range R-5 Pobeda (SS-3 Shyster) which was based in East Germany starting in 1956 and was known by British intelligence to be equipped with chemical weapons and aimed at London. They were additionally aware of the ongoing development of the medium-range R-12 Dvina (SS-4 Sandal) which could reach the UK from western Soviet areas. The ADC stated that \\"Although the nuclear deterrent is the prime means of defence, a direct defence should be developed to a significantly high level.\\" The next month, this was formalized as Air Staff Target OR.1135. In response, the Ministry of Supply placed contracts with English Electric and Marconi Electronic Systems to begin studies on an overall defensive system. This marks the official beginning of Violet Friend. OR.1135 was concerned only with weapons with a range over , as it was assumed they could be kept that far from UK shores. This eliminated the need to deal with shorter-ranged weapons like Scud which had very short flight times. It also ignored conventionally armed weapons, as they believed these did not present a credible threat. Further, the need was to protect only the UK, not overseas locations or the Army in the field. An advanced draft of the OR was sent to Canada, who issued the Canadian General Air Staff Target written along the same lines but aimed only at ICBMs. The Canadians expressed their concerns about a suitable radar being available by 1960/61. A review of the work by English Electric and Marconi was carried out in December 1955 by the Deputy Director Operational Requirements (DDOR5). The basic outline was a system using a Mach 2 interceptor missile based about from the defended area, and covering a radius of about . An attack by a total of 150 missiles was assumed. A basic system would require eight bases, but had no redundancy and would provide no coverage over Belfast or Plymouth. A larger system with some redundancy and coverage of those cities and all bomber bases required fourteen bases. Each site expected to have to attack ten missiles at once. Considering the smaller deployment, the system required six operations rooms, six early warning radars, 150 tracking radars, 15 launch control sites, 600 launchers and 1,000 missiles. Such a system was estimated to cost ¬£70 million, which was rounded up to ¬£100 million. This was about the same price as the \\"Stage 1\\" anti-aircraft system, which was already approved for deployment. A serious concern was raised at this point; if one assumed that a ballistic missile with a range of would cost about ¬£200,000, and based on the assumption that a salvo of four missiles would be fired at each warhead, this meant the defensive volley cost twice as much as its target. They concluded that \\"the position of the defence tends to be economically unfavourable even in the best case.\\" This basic idea would become a serious concern in the future, when it would be formalized as the cost-exchange ratio, and was ultimately one of the major arguments against a national-scale ABM system being deployed in the US. =Design concepts= Another international ABM meeting, this time including Canada, was held in London between 18 and 20 January 1956. The UK presented their work to date. A Marconi paper suggested the early warning task was technically possible and went on to consider radar jamming that might make the task considerably more difficult. The general topic of radar jamming became a major concern for the UK, and ultimately led to the RX12874 anti-jamming system that was part of the future Linesman/Mediator radar network of the late 1960s. A second report by the MoD talked about the use of radar reflectors as decoys in space, suggesting that because they would slow down rapidly in the lower atmosphere, they could begin to be picked out at about , but might not be fully distinguished until . This represented a serious problem for systems like Violet Friend, as there was no way to distinguish the decoys until long after the missiles had to be launched; the only solution would be to launch a volley of missiles at all the potential targets. Summing up the meeting, Robert Cockburn noted that the three countries had concepts that were \\"remarkably close.\\" On the positive side, everyone agreed that radars of the required performance were possible, and that tracking systems of the required accuracy could be developed. It was also noted that there were significant unknowns in the performance of the missile, but there did not appear to be any insurmountable issues. The main concern remained the issues of the vulnerability of the target, and the various decoy systems. As a result of this meeting, the UK design changed; they no longer felt that a slow missile would be useful, and a new purpose-designed missile would be needed. Several reviews disagreed with this assessment, suggesting that such a system would arrive too late, and would cost too much. Additional comments suggested that the limited defensive role being envisioned was of no use and that every warhead approaching the UK needed to be attacked. The variations and concepts did not seem to be gelling. =Violet Friend= Late in 1957, the Royal Aircraft Establishment began work with both Bristol Aerospace and Ferranti for alternatives to the EE/Marconi designs. Bristol responded in early 1958 with the first definitive design for such a system. This would use the Red Duster Series 2 Mark 2, later to be known as Bloodhound Mk. 3, combined with the Type 85 radar for early warning, Type 86 for terminal tracking and FPS-16 for midcourse tracking. In action, the Type 85 would detect the missile while it was launching, and then cue one of the UK-based FPS-16's onto it. These radars would track the booster as it launched, determining the trajectory and probable impact point. The warhead itself proved a difficult target for radar, it was both small and well angled, giving it a very low radar cross section. Thus the warhead would not be tracked directly; instead, the initial tracking would be on the booster, with the assumption that the warhead would be somewhere within a mile of the booster during this stage. As it approached the UK, the Netherlands-based FPS-16's would then re-acquire the missile as it passed overhead. Looking at the objects from below and to the side meant they had a significantly better view in radar terms, allowing them to pick out the warhead. This information would then be fed back to the UK, where the Type 86 would begin to search and then lock-on to the selected objects. The Bloodhound would be launched into the estimated reentry area long before the warhead arrived, demanding the tracks be developed rapidly and that it be flown into the target intercept area under ground control. When the Type 86 locked onto the warhead, the missile's internal receiver would pick it up and the missile would do a \\"jerk\\" manoeuvre to align with the warhead. The interception would take place as low as altitude. =Competing approaches= Work also continued on the design of a dedicated interceptor missile, with some early work showing a design more similar to the English Electric Thunderbird in basic form, using a solid fuel rocket sustainer and traditional rear-end fins for guidance. Further improvements were considered by using adaptations of the Skylark sounding rocket, or one based on work from the RAE's Missile 8. These more advanced designs would travel anywhere between and push out the interception altitude to . This system would need to be available sometime between 1968 and 1970, when it was estimated that Soviet missiles would have the half-mile accuracy needed to attack a missile silo containing Blue Streak. In the case of OR.1135, the cost-exchange argument began to swing the decision in favour of a basic system re-using as much existing hardware as possible, as opposed to a dedicated ABM with higher performance. That meant that it could be deployed for less cost, but more importantly, it could cost less to increase the defence if the Soviets responded by building more missiles. On the flip side, if some problem arose, like the addition of high-quality decoys, the program could be cancelled without too much being wasted. There was also considerable debate over whether the program should upgrade the Bloodhound or purchase the Nike Hercules for this role. Hercules already had a launch-phase command guidance system and thus removed the need to develop a new version of the Bloodhound. On the other hand, it was seen that the development of a nuclear-armed Bloodhound would make it much more lethal against bombers as well, and would be able to be deployed at the Bloodhound bases already under construction. =Final concept= Ferranti further refined the interim concept, suggesting that six existing launch sites for Bloodhound Mk. 1 were suitable conversion to Mk. 3, and these would cover most of the bomber bases. These would be supported by two FPS-16 sites in the Netherlands and four Type 85's, two each at two separated control sites. The RRE then added their own comments, suggesting the system be deployed at sixteen sites, ten of them existing Mk. 1 and Mk. 2 sites and six new ones. This would provide complete coverage over all the bomber airbases, sixteen Thor IRBM sites, and seven US airbases. To be effective they suggested being able to attack six targets at once, which would require five Type 85's, six FPS-16's in the Netherlands, and eight more in the UK. This could be ready by 1963 if the Type 85 radar were ready by that time. They put the price at ¬£1.46 million for development and ¬£12.5 million for deployment, although that included funds already allocated for the anti-aircraft sites. =Active defence ends= In 1959, Harold Watkinson took over the Ministry of Defence (MoD), and Duncan Sandys returned to the Ministry of Aviation. Watkinson instituted a sweeping review of ongoing projects. Blue Streak was cancelled in April 1960, largely because they felt it would not represent a credible deterrent once Soviet missiles could attack the silos directly. A new report by the Ministry of Aviation following the cancellation noted: Active defence remained an area of study for the next few years, although little funding was provided for anything outside early warning systems. A January 1961 release by the Powell Committee, set up in 1959 to consider the entire deterrent question, examined the issue again and concluded that attacking warheads that were not accompanied by decoys remained possible, but that the presence of decoys would so upset the economic balance that the entire concept \\"foundered\\". What emerged as the final major look at the topic was published by the Ministry of Defence under the direction of the RRE's William Penley. The Penley Report's conclusions were much the same as Powell's, noting that operating against warheads appeared a solved problem, but \\"in the face of decoys, discrimination becomes well nigh impossible.\\" A supporting paper outlined many of the technical details, including the suggestion that conventional warheads might be used in future interceptors, and then going on to consider lasers, radio beams, and electron and proton beams. All faced \\"fundamental problems.\\" A final note was offered by the Air Ministry while commenting on the Penley report: \\"The overall policy of nuclear deterrence is based on the main assumption that a viable defence against ballistic missile attack is not possible now, nor can be foreseen to be possible at any given future date\\". The AST.1135 was planned to be superseded by an actual development contract under Air Staff Requirement (ASR) 1155, but this was never issued. AST.1135 was officially cancelled in June 1965. Description =Early warning= The Type 85, originally for aircraft tracking, would provide early warning in Violet Friend. The entire Violet Friend system was highly reliant on the earliest possible warning of an attack. A radar in the UK mounted at like the Type 85 had a radar horizon against a missile at altitude at just over . Several Type 85s were to continually scan the horizon to look for launches, feeding this information both to their associated battery as well as to each other via datalink. Later plans called for one of the sites at RAF Watton. =Tracking= The FPS-16 was designed to provide highly accurate tracks for missile test ranges, making it perfectly suited to quickly generating tracking information to feedback to the Violet Friend control centres. As the interceptor missile had to be launched shortly after detection and had to place itself relatively close to the ultimate intercept location, detailed tracking information was required as early as possible. To arrange this, radars would be forward deployed in the Netherlands at two sites, one in the south near Terneuzen and the second in the north on the island of Terschelling. These would be able to look sideways at the missiles as they passed, giving them an excellent image of the warheads and boosters. It was assumed the booster would be the primary signal and that the warhead would be within a mile of it. To achieve the accuracy needed, the system would use the FPS-16 radar. This was originally designed as an instrumentation radar used at missile testing sites to provide highly accurate information for performance measurements. It was an early monopulse radar design, using this technique to achieve higher accuracy than earlier conical scanning systems. The use as an active missile tracking system in Violet Friend was somewhat novel. When the early tracking information was achieved, the interceptor missile was launched as soon as could be, on a course that would take it as close to the estimated location of the warhead as possible. As the warhead continued its approach to the UK, it would become more easily visible as it descended. In some versions of the system, a second set of FPS-16's in the UK would then attempt to lock onto the warhead during this phase. In either event, the Type 86 guidance radars would be used to pick up the warhead and the missile would see this signal as soon as it locked on. =Missile= At the time Violet Friend was first being considered, the Bloodhound missile was still in development and known by its rainbow code Red Duster. Red Duster was a relatively short-range system, with a maximum effective range on the order of . Red Duster was designed to fill an interim \\"Stage 1\\" deployment while waiting for a much longer-ranged \\"Stage 2\\" design, Blue Envoy. Blue Envoy was cancelled in 1957 as attention turned from bombers to missiles. By that time several components of the system had been tested, while others were progressing well. It was decided to fold these technologies into Red Duster, which had entered production as Bloodhound. The result was Bloodhound Mk. 2. The larger engines from the Blue Envoy allowed the weight to be increased, which was put to use by extending the fuselage to add more fuel tanks. This extended the range to a respectable in a system that was otherwise very similar to the original design. Additionally, the new continuous wave radars, mainly the Type 86, gave the system much better performance against jamming. It was right as the Mk. 2 was being designed in 1957 that Bristol was invited to join the Violet Friend program. Their proposal was based on a further modified version of the Mk. 2. The original designs used semi-active radar guidance, with the targets being continually illuminated by the Type 86 and a receiver in the missile using that signal for guidance. In the ABM role, the missile would have to be launched long before the enemy warhead arrived, so this required a new command guidance system to be used during the launch phase. The combination of this new guidance system and a small nuclear warhead became the Mk. 3. With these exceptions, the Mk. 3 was otherwise similar to the Mk. 2, and the Mk. 1 before it. They could all be launched from the same missile launchers, and used the same radars. In the ABM role the launch control would be remote and have ties to other radars as well, but the overall system was otherwise similar. A key aspect of the system was a fast reload time so follow-up salvos could be attacked. For the warhead, several designs were considered, the ~6 kT Indigo Hammer, the smaller Pixie, and the similar- sized Wee Gwen, a UK version of the W54 \\"Wee Gnat\\" of the US's Davy Crockett.

The person in question is more likely this was Jacob's father George Millett.  Historical context  During the American Revolution, Nova Scotia was invaded regularly by American Revolutionary forces by land and sea. Throughout the war, American privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities. There were constant attacks by privateers,Benjamin Franklin also engaged France in the war, which meant that many of the privateers were also from France. which began seven years earlier with the Raid on St. John (1775) and included raids on all the major outposts in Nova Scotia.Raids happened at Liverpool (October 1776, March 1777, September 1777, May 1778, September 1780) and on Annapolis Royal (1781) (Roger Marsters (2004). Bold Privateers: Terror, Plunder and Profit on Canada's Atlantic Coast\\", pp. 87‚Äì89 ) The first raid on Chester happened in 1779 and the second happened three years later.  Raid on Chester  Chester Blockhouse (present-day Wisteria Cottage House), Chester, Nova Scotia On June 30, the day before the raid on Lunenburg, Stoddard and two other privateers descended on Chester, Nova Scotia firing cannon from their vessels. Captain of the militia Jonathan Prescott fired cannon from the blockhouse (The Cannons Prescott used are now located on the grounds of the Chester Legion.http://www.newscotland1398.net/lunenco/cheslgn.html) Prescott's cannon fire struck one of the privateers. As a result, the privateers retreated behind Nass' Point. The crews went ashore and requested of Prescott to bury their dead. Prescott indicated that if they disarmed themselves, they would be assisted. Eventually, Prescott invited Stoddard and the two other captains to tea. Realizing the community was still vulnerable to attack, Prescott and his son lied to the privateers that Commander Creighton at Lunenburg had sent 100 soldiers to be billeted at Chester that evening. Upon the privateers retreating to their vessels, Captain Jacob Millett led women and children marching in red colours, pretended to be British soldiers from Lunenburg. The privateers left Chester to raid Lunenburg the following day. The History of the County of Lunenburg, pp. 270-171  Afterward  Chester Blockhouse Cannons, Chester Legion, Chester, Nova Scotia Raid on Chester, Street Banner, Chester, Nova Scotia The day after the raid on Chester, the American privateers redirected their attack on Lunenburg, presumably believing the Lunenburg militia had left the town to defend Chester. Prescott was suspected of being an American Patriot sympathizer given that, after the initial hostile engagement, Prescott reportedly allowed Captain Noah Stoddard to bury his dead and then had tea with him the day before Stoddard orchestrated the Raid on Lunenburg (1782). People were also suspicious of Prescott's allegiance because a number of Dr. Prescott's family were Patriots in the American Revolution. His nephew Samuel road with Paul Revere. Samuel eventually was taken prisoner to Halifax where he is reported to have died during the war. Jonathan named one of his son's after his nephew Samuel and he is buried in Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia).

The bulk of the Persian Isma'ilis broke away from the declining Fatimids in 1095, forming the Nizari sect, under Hassan-i Sabbah. Triggered by the extremely hostile milieu of the Abbasid‚ÄìSeljuk order, the Ismailis revolted: Hassan captured the Alamut Castle, and his followers captured many similar strongholds inside Seljuk territories. Socio-economic factors and the religious background of the population, as well as the politically decentralized nature of the Seljuk government, all facilitated the rapid spread of the revolt, while the Ismailis' effective acquisition of strongholds and loyalties and the selective removal of key enemies through assassination thwarted continuous Seljuk military efforts against their weaker opponent. The movement of the Nizaris soon lost its initial vigor and their territories were confined to isolated strongholds in remote areas. However, the Seljuks failed to exterminate the Nizaris after prolonged wars, and tacitly accepted their existence. The Nizari government proved to be stable and even outlasted that of the Seljuks. Sources The bulk of the sources written by the Nizaris are lost after the Mongol invasion and during the Ilkhanate period. Much of what is known about Nizari history in Persia is based on the hostile Ilhanate-era history works Tarikh-i Jahangushay (by Ata-Malik Juvayni), Zubdat at-Tawarikh (by Abd Allah ibn Ali al-Kashani), and Jami' al-Tawarikh (by Rashid al-Din Hamadani). The participants and the nature of the conflicts The Great Seljuk Empire at its greatest extent The conflicts were more complex than a simple Nizari vs Seljuk one. Even the Ismailis themselves were not unified; e.g. the Ismailis in Isfahan did not recognize the authority of Alamut. Sometimes the actual anti- Ismailism came from the local Sunni population rather than the Seljuk government, such as the massacre of the Ismailis in Isfahan in 1101. In the Seljuk dynastic conflicts, all sides were relying on Ismaili soldiers, and some Seljuk elites are known to be Ismaili converts (e.g. Iranshah ibn Turanshah) or at least to have Nizari sympathies at times (e.g. Barkiyaruq and Ridwan ibn Tutush). The general pattern of the territorial exchanges is that, whenever and wherever the Seljuk Sultan's authority diminished, the Nizaris went on the fill the gap. Hassan-i Sabbah's establishment of the Alamut state By the final decades of the imamate of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir Billah, many in Persia (then under the Seljuk Empire) had converted to the Fatimid doctrine of Ismailism, while the Qarmatian doctrine was declining. Apparently, the Ismailis of Persia had already acknowledged the authority of a single Chief Da'i (missionary) based in a secret headquarters in the Seljuk capital, Isfahan. The Chief Da'i in the 1070s was Abd al-Malik ibn Attash, a Fatimid scholar who was respected even among Sunni elites. He led a revolt in 1080 provoked by the increasingly severe Seljuk repressions of the Ismailis. Among da'is active under Abd al-Malik was Hassan-i Sabbah. The Persian Ismailis were aware of the declining power of the Fatimids. Hassan, too, must have realized that the Fatimid Caliphate (now effectively under the control of da'i al-du'at Badr al-Jamali) was unwilling and incapable of supporting the Persian Ismailis in their struggle against the Seljuks; thus he designed an independent revolutionary strategy. During his nine years of activity in service of the Fatimid da'wah in different parts of Persia, Hassan had evaluated the strengths and the weaknesses of the Seljuks. He concentrated his efforts in the northern mountainous region of Daylam, a traditional stronghold for Zaydi Shias which had been already penetrated by the Ismaili da'wa. Map of the north Persia Alamut was especially difficult to access, and the fortress was built to withstand long sieges. By 1087, Hassan had chosen the inaccessible and remote castle of Alamut as his future base. From his base Damghan and later Shahriyarkuh (in Tabaristan), he dispatched several da'is to convert the locals of the settlements in the Alamut valley. Hassan was eventually appointed as the Fatimid Da'i of Daylam. Hassan's activities were noticed by the Seljuk vizier Nizam al-Mulk (the de facto Seljuk ruler), who ordered his son-on-law Abu Muslim, the governor of Rayy, to arrest the da'i. Hassan managed to remain hidden and secretly arrived at Daylam in time, temporarily settling in Qazvin. Hassan captured the Alamut Castle from its Zaydi ruler Mahdi through an ingenious plan. Some of Mahdi's guards had already been secretly converted to Ismailism by Hassan's da'is, notably Husayn Qa'ini. From Qazvin Hassan sent one further da'i to Alamut; meanwhile, Ismailis from elsewhere infiltrated the Alamut region. Hasan then moved to Ashkawar, and then Anjirud, becoming closer to the castle, and secretly entered the castle itself on the eve of September 4, 1090, living there for a while disguised as a children's teacher. Mahdi eventually discovered Hassan's true identity but was powerless since most of the garrison and locals were now Ismaili converts. Hassan permitted Mahdi to leave peacefully and then paid him via Muzaffar, a Seljuk ra'is and a secret Ismaili, 500 dinars for the castle. The seizure marks the establishment of the Ismaili state in Persia and the beginning of the so-called Alamut Period in which the Ismaili mission unfolded as an open revolt against the Sunni authorities. =Open revolt: expansion in Rudbar and Quhistan= The Ismailis quickly began to construct or capture (by conversion or force) new strongholds in Rudbar, the region in which the Alamut Castle is located, situated on the bank of the Shahrud river. Meanwhile, Hassan sent Husayn Qa'ini to his homeland, Quhistan (a region southwest of Khurasan), where he was even more successful. Quhistani people resented the rule of their oppressive Seljuk emir even more, such that the movement spread there not through secret conversion but an open revolt. Soon the major towns of Tun (modern Ferdows), Tabas, Qa'in, and Zuzan came under the Ismaili control. Since then, the Ismaili province of Quhistan was governed by a local ruler titled muhtasham () appointed from Alamut. The areas chosen by the Ismaili leaders (Rudbar, Quhistan, and later Arrajan) had key advantages: difficult mountainous terrain, dissatisfied population, and a local tradition of Ismaili or at least Shia tendencies. Initially, the Ismailis gained support mostly in rural areas. They also received crucial support from non-Ismailis who sympathized with them merely due to socio-economic or political reasons. The Ismailis thus transformed into a formidable and disciplined revolutionary group against the Abbasid‚ÄìSeljuk order. A complex set of religious and political motives was behind the revolt. The Ismailis could not tolerate the anti-Shia policies of the Seljuks, the new pioneers of the Sunni Islam in what is now called the Sunni Revival. The early widespread Ismaili revolt in Persia was, less conspicuously, an expression of national Persian Muslim sentiment: the Persians, who had been Islamized but not Arabized,Iran in History by Bernard Lewis. were conscious of their distinct identity in the Muslim World and viewed the Seljuk Turks (and their Turkish predecessors, Ghaznavids and Qarakhanids which had put an end to the so-called Iranian intermezzo) as foreigners who had invaded their homeland from Central Asia.B. Hourcade, ‚ÄúALAM≈™T,‚Äù Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, I/8, pp. 797-801; an updated version is available online at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/alamut-valley- alborz-northeast-of-qazvin- (accessed on 17 May 2014). The Seljuk rule was detested by various social classes. Hassan himself was reportedly openly resented the Seljuks and the Turks. Notably, the Ismaili state was the first Muslim community that adopted Persian as their religious language. Economic issues further contributed to the widespread revolt. The new Seljuk social order which was based on iqta' (allotted land), which subjugated the locals under a Turk emir and his army that levied heavy taxes. In sharp contrast, the Ismaili state was dedicated to the ideal of social justice. Early Seljuk responses The first bloodshed perpetrated by the Ismailis against the Seljuks was possibly before the capture of Alamut. An Ismaili group performing joint prayers was arrested in Sawa by the Seljuk police chief and were freed after being questioned. The group later unsuccessfully attempted to convert a muezzin from Sawa who was active in the Seljuk capital Isfahan. Fearing that he would denounce the Ismailis, the group murdered the muezzin. Hearing the news, the vizier Nizam al-Mulk ordered the execution of their leader, Tahir, and his body was dragged through the market. Tahir was a son of a senior preacher who had been lynched by the mob in Kirman for being an Ismaili. Yurun-Tash, the emir holding the iqta' of Rudbar, quickly begin to harass and massacre the Ismailis at the foot of Alamut. The inchoate Nizari resistance was about to be broken and the garrison considered abandoning the fortress due to a lack of supplies. Hassan, however, persuaded them to resist after claiming to receive a special message promising good fortune from the Imam al- Mustansir Billah. Yurun-Tash died of natural causes and his forces were defeated.Alamut was later nicknamed baldat al-iqbƒÅl (, literally \\"the city of good fortune\\") after this incident.https://books.google.com/books?id=KwvHBQAAQBAJ&pg;=PT166 =Campaigns of Sultan Malikshah and Nizam al-Mulk= Accroding to medieval Western legends, the Old Man of the Mountain (Hassan Sabbah) ordered a fida'i to stab himself and another one to throw himself from Alamut's walls, convincing Malikshah I's envoy that his men embrace death. 19th-century drawing by Pierre M√©janel, from ' (1886) of L√©o Taxil. Sultan Malikshah and his vizier Nizam al- Mulk soon realized the inability of the local emirs to check the Ismaili menace. In 1092, they sent two separate armies against Rudbar and Quhistan. The garrison of Alamut consisted of only 70 men with limited supplies when the Seljuk army under emir Arslan-Tash arrived there. Hassan-i Sabbah asked for assistance from the Qazwin-based da'i Dihdar Abu Ali Ardestani, who broke the Seljuk line with his 300 men and resupplied and reinforced Alamut. In coordination with local people, the reinforced garrison made a surprise attack in September-October 1092, routing the army of Arslan-Tash. Nizam al-Mulk, the vizier and de facto ruler of the Seljuk Empire, was assassinated in 1092 by the Nizaris. It was the most prominent and the first of the fifty assassinations performed during Hassan-i Sabbah's reign While planning further anti-Ismaili campaigns, Nizam al-Mulk was assassinated on October 14, 1092, in western Persia. The assassination was performed by a fida'i sent by Hassan-i Sabbah, though it is often considered to be at the instigation of Sultan Malikshah and his wife Terken Khatun, who were wary of the all-powerful vizier. Meanwhile, the Seljuk army against Quhistan, led by emir Qizil-Sarigh and supported by forces from Khorasan and Sistan, had concentrated their efforts against the castle of Darah, a dependency of the Ismaili castle of Mu'min-Abad. Sultan Malikshah died in November 1092 and as a result, the soldiers besieging Darah withdrew, because the Seljuk soldiers traditionally owed their allegiance to the Seljuk sultan in person. With the death of Nizam al-Mulk and Malikshah, all planned actions against the Ismailis were aborted. Seljuk civil war of 1092‚Äì1105: further Ismaili expansion and schism A decade-long civil war began involving the Seljuk claimants and the semi- independents Seljuk emirs who constantly shifted their allegiances. Barkiyaruq had been proclaimed as the ruler, supported by the relatives of Nizam al-Mulk and the Abbasid caliph al-Mustazhir. His rivals included his half-brother Muhammad Tapar and Tutush, who held Syria. The latter was killed in 1095 in battle, but fighting with Muhammad Tapar, who was backed by Sanjar, was indecisive. Buzurg-Ummid captured Lamasar and rebuilt it into a major stronghold. The Nizari strongholds were specifically built to withstand long sieges (Gerdkuh, for example, resisted a Mongol siege of 17 years). During the chaos of the Seljuk civil war and the power vacuum that developed, the Ismailis consolidated and expanded their positions into many places such as Fars, Arrajan, Kirman, and Iraq, often with temporary help from Seljuk emirs. Hassan-i Sabbah made Alamut as impregnable as possible. Assisted by the local allies, new fortresses were seized in Rudbar. In 1093, the Ismailis took the Anjirud village and repelled an invading force there. In the same year, a 10,000-strong army consisting mostly of Sunnis of Rayy and commanded by the Hanafi scholar Za'farani was also defeated in Taliqan. Soon another raid by the Seljuk emir Anushtagin is also repelled. As a result of these victories, the local chiefs of Daylam gradually shifted their allegiance to the nascent Alamut state. Among these was a certain Rasamuj who held the important Lamasar castle near Alamut. He later tried to defect to Anushtagin. In November 1096 (or 1102, per Juwayni) an Ismaili force under Kiya Buzurg-Ummid, Kiya Abu Ja'far, Kiya Abu Ali, and Kiya Garshasb attacked the castle and captured it. Buzurg-Ummid was appointed by Hassan as Lamasar's commandant and expanded it into the largest Ismaili fortress. In 1094, the Fatimid Caliph-Imam al- Mustansir died and his vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah quickly placed the young al- Musta'li on the Fatimid throne, who was subsequently recognized as the Imam by the Ismailis under the Fatimid influence (i.e. those of Egypt, much of Syria, Yemen, and western India). However, al-Mustansir had originally designated Nizar as his heir. As a result, the Ismailis of the Seljuk territories (i.e. Persia, Iraq, and parts of Syria), now under the authority of Hassan-i Sabbah, severed the already weakened ties with the Fatimid organization in Cairo and effectively established an independent da'wa organization of their own on behalf of the then-inaccessible Nizari Imams.Those of the easternmost areas of the Ismaili world, notably Ghazna and the Oxus valley, remained outside of either the Nizari or Musta'li influence for a long time. In 1095, Nizar's revolt was crushed in Egypt and he was imprisoned in Cairo. Further revolts by his offsprings were also unsuccessful. Apparently, Nizar himself had not designated any successor. Hassan was recognized as the hujja (full- representative) of the then-inaccessible Imam. Rare Nizari coins from Alamut belonging to Hassan and his two successors bear the name of an anonymous descendant of the Nizar. The \\"fortified mountain\\" of Girdkuh, one of the most impregnable Nizari strongholds, had been acquired by cunning through a Seljuk commander who was secretly a Nizari. The Nizaris often infiltrated the Seljuk military. In 1095, the Seljuk vizier al-Balasani who was a Twelver Shia, entrusted the Iraqi citadel of Takrit to the officer Kayqubad Daylami, an Ismaili. The citadel, one of the few open Nizari strongholds, remained in their hands for 12 years (al-Balasani was later lynched by the Seljuks). Many new scattered strongholds were also seized, including Ustunawand in Damavand and Mihrin (Mihrnigar), Mansurkuh, and the strategic Girdkuh in Qumis. Gerdkuh was acquired and refortified by the Seljuk ra'is Muzaffar, a secret Isma'ili convert and lieutenant of emir Habashi, who in turn had acquired the fort in 1096 from Sultan Barkiyaruq. Barkiyaruq, who never enjoyed a reputation of being the Sunnis defender, accepted Ismailis in his forces at times of dire necessity. In 1100, near Girdkuh, 5,000 Ismailis from Quhistan and elsewhere under ra'is Muzaffar fought alongside Habashi and Barkiyaruq against Sanjar; Habashi was killed, however. Muzaffar later managed to transfer Habashi's treasure to Girdkuh and, after completing the fortifications, transferred the fortress into the Nizari possession in the same year and publicly declared himself an Ismaili. Abu Hamza, another Ismaili da'i from Arrajan who was a shoemaker studied in Fatimid Egypt, returned to his hometown and seized at least two nearby castles. The Nizari were very successful during the reign of Barkiyaruq, especially after 1096. Besides consolidating their positions and seizing new strongholds, they managed to spread the da'wa into the towns as well as Barkiyaruq's court and army and thus directly meddling in Seljuk affairs. Despite assassination attempts against Barkiyaruq himself, the opposing Seljuk factions often blamed him for the assassination (attempt)s against their officers and accused all Barkiyaruq's soldiers of Ismailism. The picturesque ruins of Shahdiz fortress. The capture of the stronghold, which overlooked the Seljuk capital, was a major strategic success of the early Ismailis. By 1100, Da'i Ahmad ibn Abd al-Malik, the son of the prominent da'i Abd al-Malik ibn Attash, managed to capture the strategic fortress of Shahdiz just outside the Seljuk capital Isfahan. Ahmad reportedly converted 30,000 people in the region and began collecting taxes from several nearby districts. A second fortress, Khanlanjan (Bazi) located south of Isfahan was also seized. In response to this growing Nizari power, Barkiyaruq reached an agreement with Sanjar in 1101 to eliminate all Nizaris in their subordinate regions, i.e. western Persian and Khurasan, respectively. Barkiyaruq supported massacres of the Nizaris in Isfahan and purged his army by executing suspected Ismaili officers, while the Abbasid caliph al-Mustazhir persecuted suspected Nizaris in Baghdad and killed some of them, as requested by Barkiyaruq. Meanwhile, Sanjar's campaign commanded by emir Bazghash against Quhistan caused much damage to the region. In 1104, another campaign in Quhistan destroyed Tabas and many Nizaris were massacred; however, no stronghold was lost and the Nizaris maintained their overall position; in fact, in 1104‚Äì1105, the Nizaris of Turshiz campaigned as far west as Rayy. The Nizaris expanded into Kirman too, and even won the Seljuk ruler of Kerman, Iranshah ibn Turanshah (1097‚Äì1101). Prompted by the local Sunni ulama' (Islamic scholars), the townspeople soon deposed and executed him. =Nizari attempts to expand in Syria= Initially, most Ismailis of Syria recognized al-Musta'li as their Imam (see above). However, the vigorous Nizari da'wa soon replaced the doctrine of the declining Fatimids there‚Äîparticularly in Aleppo and the Jazr region‚Äîand the Syrian Musta'li community was reduced to an insignificant element by 1130. Nevertheless, the Nizari mission in Syria proved to be more challenging than in Persia: their fledgling presence in Aleppo and later Damascus was soon eliminated, and they acquired a cluster of strongholds only after a half-century of continuous efforts. The methods of struggle of the da'is in Syria were the same as those in Persia: seizing strongholds as bases for activity in the nearby areas, selective elimination of prominent enemies, and temporary alliances with various local chiefs to reach objectives. Background The Nizari activity in Syria began in the early years of the 12th century or a few years earlier in the form of da'is dispatched from Alamut. Tutush I's death in 1095 and Frankish Crusader advances in 1097 caused Syria to become unstable and politically fragmented into several rival states. The decline of the Fatimids after al-Mustansir Billah's death coupled with the aforementioned political confusion of Seljuks and the Crusader threats all urged Sunnis and Shias (including Musta'lis and non-Ismailis such as Druzes and Nusayris) to shift their allegiance to the Nizari state, which boasted its rapid success in Persia. Rise and fall in Aleppo Ridwan. In the Seljuk \\"regime of many emirs\\", the Nizaris formed many local alliances to reach their objectives. In the first phase lasted until 1113, the Nizaris under da'i al- Hakim al-Munajjim allied themselves with Ridwan, the emir of Aleppo a key political figure in Syria along with his brother Duqaq, who was the emir of Damascus. The da'i even joined Ridwan's entourage, and the Aleppine Nizaris established a Mission House ( dar al-dawah) in the city. Among their actions include the assassination of Janah ad-Dawla, the emir of Hims and a key opponent of Ridwan. Afamiyya by stratagem Al-Hakim al-Munajjim died in 1103 and was replaced by the da'i Abu Tahir al-Sa'igh, also sent by Hassan-i Sabbah. Abu Tahir, too, enjoyed an alliance with Ridwan and kept using the Nizari base in Aleppo. He attempted to seize strongholds in pro-Isma'ili areas, especially the Jabal al-Summaq highlands located between the Orontes River and Aleppo. At this period, the authority over the upper Orontes valley had been shared between the assassinated Janah al-Dawlah, the Munqidhites of Shaizar, and Khalaf ibn Mula'ib, the Fatimid governor of Afamiyya (Qal'at al- Mudhiq) who had seized the fortified city from Ridwan. Khalaf ibn Mula'ib, was probably a Musta'li that had refused the Nizari alliance. Abu Tahir, with the help of local Nizaris under a certain Abu al-Fath of Sarmin, assassinated Khalaf in February 1106 and acquired the citadel of Qal'at al-Mudhiq by an \\"ingenious\\" plan. Tancred, the Frankish regent of Antioch besieged the city, but he was unsuccessful. A few months later in September 1106, he besieged the city again and captured it with the help of Khalaf's brother, Mus'ab ibn Mula'ib. Abu al-Fath was executed, but Abu Tahir ransomed himself and returned to Aleppo. In 1111, the Nizari forces joined Ridwan as he closed Aloppo's gate to the expeditionary force of Mawdud, the Seljuk atabeg of Mosul, who had come to Syria to fight the Crusaders. However, in his final years, Ridwan retreated from his earlier alliances with the Nizaris due to the determined anti-Nizari campaign of Muhammad Tapar (see below) coupled with increasing unpopularity of the Nizaris among the Sunnis of Aleppo. Mawdud was assassinated in 1113, but it is uncertain who was actually behind the attack. Ridwan died shortly after and his young son and successor Alp Arslan al-Akhras initially supported the Nizaris, even ceding the Balis fortress on the Aleppo‚ÄìBaghdad road to Abu Tahir. During his anti-Nizari campaign, the Seljuq sultan Muhammad Tapar as well as Sa'id ibn Badi', the ra'is of Aleppo and militia (al-ahdath) commander, turned Alp Arslan against the Nizaris. In the subsequent persecution led by Sa'id, Abu Tahir and many other Nizaris in Aleppo were executedAmong the executed were Abu Tahir himself, da'i Isma'il, and a rother of al-Hakim al-Munajjim. and others dispersedIncluding the commander of the Nizari armed forces in Aleppo, Husam al-Din ibn Dumlaj, who fled to al-Raqqa, and the commandant of the Balis fort, Ibrahim al-Ajami, who fled to Shaizar. or went underground. A attempt by Nizaris of Aleppo and elsewhere to seize the Shaizar castle is defeated by the Munqidhites. Thus Nizaris failed to gain any permanent base in Syria, but they managed to create contacts and convert many people, especially in the Jabal al-Summaq, the Jazr, and Banu Ulaym's territories between Shayzar and Sarmin. Rise and fall in Damascus After the execution of his predecessor Abu Tahir al-Sa'igh and the uprooting of the Nizaris in Aleppo, Bahram al-Da'i was sent by Alamut in an attempt to expand the resurrect the Nizari cause in Syria. In 1118, Aleppo was captured by Ilghazi, the Artuqid prince of Mardin and Mayyafariqin. The Nizaris of Aleppo demanded Ilghazi cede al-Sharif Castle to them, but Ilghazi had the castle dismantled and pretended that the order was given earlier. The demolition was conducted by qadi Ibn al-Khashshab, who was earlier involved in a massacre of the Nizaris (he was later assassinated by the Nizaris in 1125). In 1124, Ilghazi's nephew, Balak Ghazi, the (nominal) governor of Aleppo, arrested the Bahram's representative there and forced the Nizaris to leave the city. Thus, Bahram focused on Southern Syria as recommended by his supporter, Ilghazi. The da'i resided there in secret and practiced his missionary activities in disguise. Supported by Ilghazi, he managed to obtain the official protection of the Burid ruler Tughtigin, atabeg of Damascus, whose vizier al-Mazadaqani had become a reliable Nizari ally. At this point in 1125, Damascus was under threats of the Frankish Crusaders under Baldwin II of Jerusalem, and Isma'ilis from Homs and elsewhere had earlier joined Tughtigin's troops and were noted for their courage, in the Battle of Marj al- Saffar against the Franks in 1126.Gibb, N. A. R., Editor (1932), The Damascus Chronicle of the Crusades. Extracted and translated from the Chronicle of ibn al-QalƒÅnisi, Luzac & Company, London, pp.174-177, 179-180, 187-191 Bahram apparently helped in the assassination of Tughtigin's enemy Aqsunqur al- Bursuqi, the governor of Mosul. Toghtekin thus welcomed Bahram. Al-Mazadaqani persuaded Toghtekin to give a Mission House in Damascus and the frontier stronghold Banias to Bahram, who refortified the stronghold and made it his military base, performing extensive raids from there and possibly capturing more places. By 1128, their activities had become so formidable that \\"nobody dared to say a word about it openly\\". Bahram was killed in 1128 while fighting local hostile tribes in Wadi al-Taym. The Fatimids in Cairo rejoiced after receiving his head. He was succeeded by Isma'il al-Ajami who kept using Banias and followed Bahram's policies. Tughtigin's successor and son, Taj al-Muluk Buri, initially continued to support the Nizaris, but, in a replay of the events in 1113 in Aleppo, he suddenly shifted his policy at the right moment, killing al-Mazdaqani and ordering a massacre of all Nizaris, which was conducted by al-ahdath (militia) and the Sunni population. Around 6,000 Nizaris were killed. Buri was instigated by the prefect and the military governor of Damascus. Isma'il al-Ajami surrendered Banias to the advancing Franks during the Crusade of 1129 and died in exile among the Franks in 1130. Despite elaborate security measures taken by Buri, he was struck in May 1131 by fida'is from Alamut and died of his wounds a year later; nevertheless, the Nizari position in Damascus was already lost forever. Sultan Muhammad Tapar's campaigns Coin minted with the names of the Abbasid caliph al- Mustazhir and the Seljuk sultan Muhammad Tapar Barkiyaruq died in 1105 and Muhammad Tapar, along Sanjar who acted as his eastern viceroy, became the unchallenged Seljuk sultan who reigned the stabilized empire until 1118. Although their expansion had probably been already checked by Barkiyaruq and Sanjar, the Nizaris still held their ground and threatened the Seljuk lands from Syria to eastern Persia, including their capital of Isfahan. Naturally, the new Sultan regarded the war against the Nizaris as an imperative. Muhammad Tapar launched a series of campaigns against the Nizaris and checked their expansion within two years after his accession. A siege of Takrit failed to capture the citadel after several months, but the Nizaris under Kayqubad were also unable to keep it and ceded it to an independent local Twelver Shia Arab ruler, the Mazyadid Sayf al-Dawla Sadaqa. At the same time, Sanjar attacked Quhistan, but the details are unknown. Muhammad Tapar's main campaign was against Shahdiz which was threatening his capital Isfahan. He eventually captured Shahdiz in 1107 after a dramatic siege involving many negotiations; some of the Ismailis safely withdrew according to an agreement, while a small group kept fighting. Their leader, Da'i Ahmad ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Attash, was captured and executed together with his son. The fortress of Khanlanjan was also probably destroyed, and the Ismaili presence in Isfahan was brought to an end. Muhammad Tapar issued a fathnama (, a victory proclamation) after the capture of Shahdiz. Probably soon after destroying Shadiz, Seljuk forces under Muhammad Tapar's atabeg of Fars, Fakhr al-Dawla Chawli, destroyed the Nizari fortresses in Arrajan in a surprise attack as he pretended to be preparing for an attack against his neighbor Bursuqids. Little is recorded about Nizaris in the area after this event. In 1106-1109, Muhammad Tapar sent an expeditionary force under his vizier Ahmad ibn Nizam al-Mulk (whose father Nizam al-Mulk and brother Fakhr al-Mulk had been assassinated by the Nizaris), accompanied by emir Chawli, against the Nizari heartland of Rudbar. The campaign devastated the area but failed to capture Alamut, and the Seljuks withdrew. Muhammad Tapar unsuccessfully attempted to receive assistance from the Bavandid ruler Shahriyar IV ibn Qarin. In 1109, Muhammad Tapar began another campaign against Rudbar. The Seljuks had realized that Alamut is impregnable to a direct assault, so they began a war of attrition by systematically destroying the crops of Rudbar for eight years and engaging in sporadic battles with the Nizaris. In 1117/1118, atabeg Anushtagin Shirgir, the governor of Sawa, took up the Seljuk command and began the siege of Lamasar on June 4, 1117, and Alamut on July 13. The Nizaris were at a difficult position; Hassan-i Sabbah and many others had sent their wives and daughters to Girdkuh and elsewhere.This practice became common among the Nizari leaders thereafter. The Nizari resistance amazed their adversary, which was being continually reinforced by other Seljuk emirs. In April 1118, the news of Muhammad Tapar's death caused the Seljuks to withdraw while reportedly being on the verge of victory; many men were lost in the retreat, and the Nizaris obtained much supplies and weapons. Apparently, the vizier Abu al-Qasim Dargazini, who was allegedly a secret Nizari, procured the new Seljuq Sultan, Mahmud II, to withdraw the forces of Anushtagin, and later poisoned the mind of the Sultan against Anushtagin, who had the latter imprisoned and executed. Muhammad Tapar's campaign thus ended as a stalemate, with the Seljuks failing to reduce the Nizari strongholds and the Nizari revolt losing its initial effectiveness.Boyle, J. A., Editor, The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 5: The Saljuq and Mongol Periods, Cambridge University Press, 1968, pgs. 118-119 Unable to repel the concerted Seljuk forces, the Nizaris continued to rely on assassinations of senior Seljuk leaders, such as Ubayd Allah ibn Ali al- Khatibi (qadi of Isfahan and the leader of the anti-Ismaili movement there) in 1108-1109, Sa'id ibn Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman (qadi of Nishapur), and other bureaucrats and emirs. Ahmad ibn Nizam al-Mulk, who led the expedition against Alamut, survived an assassination attempt in Baghdad, though he was wounded. In 1116/1117, the Seljuk emir of Maragha, Ahmadil ibn Ibrahim al-Kurdi, was assassinated by the Nizaris in a large assembly in presence of Sultan Muhammad Tapar‚Äîa blow to the prestige of the Seljuks. After Sultan Muhammad Tapar: toward stalemate The Nizaris used an opportunity to recover during another destructive civil war among the Seljuks after Sultan Muhammad's death. For the rest of the Seljuk period, the situation was a virtual stalemate and a tacit mutual acceptance emerged between the Nizaris and the Sunni rulers. The great movement to establish a new millennium in the name of the hidden Imam had been reduced into regional conflicts and border raids, and the Nizari castles had been turned into centers of small local sectarian dynasties. Seljuk campaigns after Sultan Muhammad were mostly half-hearted and indecisive, while the Nizaris lacked the initial strength to repeat successes such as the capture of Shahdiz. The Seljuk sultans did not consider the Nizaris, who were now mostly in remote fortresses, a threat to their interests. The Seljuks even used the Nizaris for their assassinations, or at least used their notoriety for the use of assassination to cover up their own assassinations; such as those of Aqsunqur al-Ahmadili and the Abbasid Caliph al-Mustarshid in 1135, probably by Sultan Mas'ud. The number of the recorded assassinations dwindles after Hassan-i Sabbah's reign. The Nizaris eventually abandoned the tactic of assassination, because political terrorism was considered reprehensible by the common people. The nature of Nizari‚ÄìSeljuk relations gradually changed in this period: the ultimate Nizari aims were no longer renounced, but their subversion in inner Seljuk territories was halted and they began to consolidate the remote territories they held instead. Small (semi)-independent Nizari states were established, which participated in local alliances and rivalries. =Sultan Mahmud II and Sultan Sanjar= Muhammad Tapar was succeeded by his son Mahmud II who ruled from 1118 until 1131 over western Persia and (nominally) Iraq, but he faced many claimants. Sanjar, who held Khorasan since 1097, was generally recognized as the head of the Seljuk family. Some Nizari forces joined Sanjar's forces in his invasion of Mahmud II's territories in 1129. The latter was defeated in Sawa and much of northern Persia, including Tabaristan and Qumis, which was penetrated by the Nizaris, came under Sanjar's rule. Mahmud II's brother, Tughril, later rebelled and retook Gilan, Qazwin, and other districts. The final years of Hassan-i Sabbah were peaceful and were mostly spent in consolidating the Nizari position, including the recapture of strongholds in Rudbar that had been lost in Shirgir's campaign, as well as intensifying the da'wa in Iraq, Adhurbayjan, Gilan, Tabaristan, and Khurasan. These successes, and those of the later decades, are partly attributed to the peaceful or friendly relations of the Nizaris with Sanjar. Juwayni has told a famous story about Hassan-i Sabbah sending a eunuch to place a dagger into the ground beside the Sultan's bed once he is asleep; Afterward, Sanjar established good relations with the Nizaris. Juwayni had also seen several manshurs (, \\"decrees\\") by Sanjar at the library of Alamut, in which the sultan had conciliated the Nizaris. Sanjar reportedly paid the Nizaris an annual of 3,000-4,000 dinars from taxes of the Qumis region, as well as allowing them to levy tolls from the caravans passing beneath Girdkuh in the Khurasan Road. Campaigns against Kiya Buzurg- Ummid In 1126, two years after Kiya Buzurg-Ummid succeeded Hasan Sabbah as the head of the Alamut state, Sultan Sanjar sent his vizier Mu'in al-Din Ahmad al-Kashi to attack the Nizaris of Quhistan with orders to massacre them and confiscate their properties. The casus belli is uncertain; it may have been motivated by a perceived weakness of the Nizaris after Hassan's death. The campaign ended with limited success. In Quhistan, a Seljuk victory in the village of Tarz (near Bayhaq) and a successful raid on Turaythith has been recorded. In the same year, Sultan Mahmud sent an army led by Shirgir's nephew, Asil, against Rudbar; this campaign was even less successful and was repelled. Another Seljuk campaign launched with local support against Rudbar was also defeated and a Seljuk emir, Tamurtughan, was captured. He was released later as requested by Sanjar. At the same time or shortly after the campaign in Quhistan, the Nizaris lost Arrajan; after this point, little is recorded about them in Arrajan, and therefore, in Khuzestan and Fars. The Nizaris were quick to take revenge‚Äîthe commander of the Quhistan's campaign, vizier al-Kashi, was assassinated in March 1127 by two fida'is who had infiltrated into his household.According to Ibn al-Athir, Sultan Sanjar launched a punitive expedition against Alamut in which 10,000 Nizaris were killed, but this is probably an invention. The Nizari heartland of Rudbar featured numerous strongholds. At the end of Buzurg-Ummid's reign, the Nizaris were stronger than before. Several fortresses (including Mansur) were captured in Taliqan, while several new ones were constructed, including Sa'adatkuh and most famously the major stronghold of Maymun-Diz in Rudbar. In 1129, the Nizaris (presumably of Quhistan) even mobilized an army and raided Sistan. In May of the same year, Sultan Mahmud moved to make peace by inviting an envoy from Alamut. The envoy, Khwaja Muhammad Nasihi Shahrastani, and his colleague were lynched by the mobs in Isfahan after visiting the Sultan. The Sultan apologized but refused Buzurgummid's request to punish the murderers. In response, the Nizaris attacked Qazwin, killing some and taking much booty; when the Qazwinis fought back, the Nizaris assassinated a Turkish emir, resulting in their withdrawal. This conflict marked the beginning of a long- lasting feud between the Qazwinis and the Nizaris of Rudbar. Sultan Mahmud himself also attacked Alamut, but he failed. Another army sent from Iraq against Lamasar also fails to achieve much. =Sultan Mas'ud, Muhammad ibn Buzurg-Ummid, and later lords of Alamut= The Abbasid Caliph Al-Mustarshid, a common enemy to both the Seljuk Sultan Mas'ud and the Nizaris, was assassinated in 1135 by a group of Nizaris, allegedly facilitated by the Seljuks. Most of the assassinations of the late Alamut Period are originated or assisted by non-Ismailis. In 1131, Sultan Mahmud II died. In the subsequent dynastic struggles, some of the emirs somehow involved the Abbasid Caliph Al- Mustarshid in the conflicts against Sultan Mas'ud. In 1139 (1135?), Sultan Mas'ud captured the caliph, together with his vizier and several dignitaries, near Hamadan, treated him with respect, and brought him to Maragha; however, while the caliph and his companions were in the royal tentage, he let a large group of Nizaris enter the tent and assassinate Al-Mustarshid and his companions; the caliph was stabbed many times. Rumors arose suggesting involvement (or at least deliberate negligence) of Sultan Mas'ud and even Sultan Sanjar (the nominal ruler of the empire). In Alamut, celebrations were held for seven days. The governor of Maragha was also assassinated shortly before the arrival of the caliph. Several other Seljuk elites were also assassinated during the reign of Kiya Buzurg-Ummid in Alamut, including a prefect of Isfahan, a prefect of Tabriz, and a mufti of Qazvin‚Äîthe list is quite shorter than that of Hassan Sabbah's reign. Al-Mustarshid's son and successor, al-Rashid, also became involved in the Seljuk dynastic conflicts, and after being deposed by an assembly of Seljuk judges and jurists, and was assassinated by the Nizaris in 5 or 6 June 1138 when he arrived in Isfahan to join his allies. In Alamut, celebrations were held again for the death of a caliph, the first victory for the new Lord of Alamut Muhammad ibn Buzurg- Ummid. In Isfahan, a great massacre of the Nizaris (or those accused to be) was committed. During the reign of Muhammad ibn Buzurg-Ummid, the Seljuk Sultan Da'ud, who had persecuted the Nizaris of Adharbaijan, was assassinated in Tabriz in 1143 by four Syrian(!) fida'is. They were allegedly sent by Zangi, the ruler of Mosul, who feared that the Sultan may depose him. An attack by Sultan Mas'ud against Lamasar and other places in Rudbar was repelled in the same year. The Nizari influence extended to Georgia (where a local ruler was assassinated) and their territories were expanded into Daylaman and Gilan, where new fortresses, namely Sa'adatkuh, Mubarakkuh, and Firuzkuh, chiefly through the efforts of the commander Kiya Muhammad ibn Ali Khusraw Firuz. Nizari operations were often led by Kiya Ali ibn Buzurg-Ummid, brother of Muhammad. They also made efforts to penetrate Ghur (in present-day Afghanistan). Other assassinations recorded during Muhammad's reign include an emir of Sultan Sanjar and one of his associates, Yamin al-Dawla Khwarazmshah (a prince of the Khwarazmian dynasty, in 1139/1140), a local ruler in Tabaristan, a vizier, and the qadis of Quhistan (in 1138/1139), Tiflis (in 1138/1139), and Hamadan (in 1139/1140), who had authorized the executions of Nizaris. Nevertheless, the stalemate mostly continued during Muhammad ibn Buzurg-Ummid's reign. The reduced number of assassinations during Muhammad's reign comes with the fact that the Nizaris were mostly occupied with building fortresses and handling local conflicts with neighboring territories, in particular raiding and counter-raidings between the Nizari heartland and their neighbor Qazwin. Two notable regional enemies of the Nizaris in this period were (1) Shah Ghazi Rustam (after the assassination of his son Girdbazu), the Bawandid ruler of Tabaristan and Gilan and (2) Abbas, the Seljuk governor of Rayy, both of whom are alleged to have built towers made of the skulls of Nizaris they massacred. Abbas was killed on Sultan Mas'ud's order and at Sanjar's request, itself after an entreaty made by a Nizari emissary; this suggests another period of truce between Sanjar and the Nizaris. Elsewhere conflicts are also reported with Sultan Sanjar, for example, the latter's attempt to restore Sunni Islam in a Nizari base in Quhistan: Al-Amid ibn Mansur (Mas'ud?), the governor of Turaythith, had submitted to the Quhistani Nizaris, but his successor Ala al-Din Mahmud appealed to Sanjar for restoring the Sunni rule there. Sanjar's army led by emir Qajaq was defeated. Soon after, another emir of Sanjar, Muhammad ibn Anaz, began to conduct \\"personal\\" raids against the Nizaris of Quhistan, probably with Sanjar's approval, until at least 1159, i.e., after Sanjar's death. In Nizari castles, the leadership was often dynastic, and thus the nature of most such conflicts are limited to that certain dynasty. Hassan II. Alamut was already a well-established state that minted its own distinct coins. The reigns of Hassan II and his son Muhammad II at Alamut were mostly peaceful, except some raids and the assassination of Adud al-Din Abu al-Faraj Muhammad ibn Abdallah, the prominent vizier of the Abbasid caliph al-Mustadi, in 1177/1178, shortly after the fall of the Fatimids by Saladin six years earlier. The Nizaris establish a foothold in Jabal Bahra' of Syria The Near East in 1135 As the Fatimid Caliphate declined soon after the Nizari‚ÄìMusta'li schism, the bulk of the Ismailis of Syria rallied toward the Nizaris. In this third phase of their activity in Syria from 1130 until 1151, the Nizaris obtained and held several strongholds in the Jabal Bahra' (the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range). Following the Crusaders' failure to capture Jabal Bahra', the Nizaris had quickly reorganized under da'i Abu al-Fath and transferred their activities from the cities to this mountainous region. Little is known about this period of Nizaris in Syria. They obtained their first fortress, al-Qadmus, by purchasing it in 1132‚Äì1133 from the governor of al-Kahf Castle, Sayf al-Mulk ibn 'Amrun. Al-Kahf itself was later sold by Sayf al-Mulk's son, Musa, to prevent the castle's fall to his rival cousins. In 1136‚Äì1137, the Frankish-occupied Khariba was captured by local Nizaris. In 1140‚Äì1141, the Nizaris captured Masyaf by killing Sunqur, who commanded the fort on behalf of the Banu Munqidh of Shayzar. Khawabi, Rusafa, Maniqa, and Qulay'a were captured around the same time. A few decades later, William of Tyre put the number of these castles at ten and the Nizari population there at 60,000.

In 1148, the Zengid emir Nur al-Din Mahmud abolished the Shia forms of prayer Aleppo, which was considered as an open war against the Ismailis and Shia Aleppines. A year later a Nizari contingent assisted Prince Raymond of Antioch in his campaign against Nur al-Din; both Raymond and the Nizari commander Ali ibn Wafa' were killed in the subsequent battle at Inab in June 1149. A succession dispute occurred after the death of Shaykh Abu Muhammad, the head of the Nizari da'wa in Syria. Eventually, the leadership was passed to Rashid al-Din Sinan by orders from Alamut. He managed to consolidate the Nizari position in Syria by adopting appropriate policies towards the Crusaders, Nur al-Din, and Saladin. Aftermath Hassan Sabbah's objective was not realized, but nor was that of the Seljuks who intended to uproot the Nizaris. Hassan, however, managed to establish a Nizari state. The confrontation became a stalemate by around 1120. The Nizari state gradually weakened due to prolonged conflicts with too many superior enemies. The indecisive Nizari policy against the Mongols also contributed to their fall after the Mongol invasion of Persia. Deprived of political power, the Nizaris were scattered in the many lands and lived until the present day as religious minorities. The Nizari state enjoyed a stability that was uncommon in other principalities of the Muslim World in that period. These are attributed to their distinct methods of struggle, the genius of their early leaders, their strong solidarity, the sense of initiative of their local leaders, their appeal to outstanding individuals, as well as their strong sense of mission and total dedication to their ultimate ideal, which they maintained even after their initial failure against the Seljuks. Conflicts continued between the Alamut and the people of Qazwin, the rulers of Tabaristan, and after the decline of the Seljuks, the Khwarezmshahs. The Ismailis of Quhistan were engaged against the Ghurids, while those of Syria gradually became independent of Alamut. Nizari methods =Decentralized strongholds= The struggles of the Persian Ismailis was characterized by distinctive patterns and methods. Modeled and named after the hijra (emigration) of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina, the Nizaris established headquarters called dar al-hijra in Iraq, Bahrayn, Yemen and the Maghreb. These were strongholds serving as defensible places of refuge as well as local headquarters for regional operations. These strongholds of the da'is were independent but cooperated with each other. This coordinated decentralized model of revolt proved to be effective since in the structure of the Seljuk Empire, especially after Malikshah, the authority was locally distributed and the empire was rather in the hands of numerous emirs and commanders (see iqta'); thus there was no single target to be confronted by a strong army, even if the Ismailis could mobilize such an army. The Ismaili fortresses in Rudbar were able to withstand long sieges: in addition to the inaccessibility of the region itself, the fortifications were built on rocky heights and were equipped large storehouses and elaborate water supply infrastructure.B. Hourcade, ‚ÄúALAM≈™T,‚Äù Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, I/8, pp. 797-801; an updated version is available online at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/alamut-valley-alborz-northeast-of- qazvin- (accessed on 17 May 2014). The Nizaris maintained cells in the cities and bases in remote areas. This strategy facilitated rapid expansion, but also made them vulnerable. =Assassination= The aforementioned structure of the Seljuk Empire as well as the vastly superior Seljuk military also suggested the Nizaris employing targeted assassination to achieve their military and political goals, which they effectively did to disrupt the Seljuk Empire. They later owed their name, Assassin, to this technique, and all the important assassinations in the region were usually attributed to them. Although many medieval anti-Nizari legends were developed with respect to this technique, few historical information is known regarding the selection and training of the fida'is ( fidƒÅ'ƒ´, plural fidƒÅ'iyƒÅn) All ordinary Persian Ismailis, who called each other as \\"comrade\\" ( rafƒ´q, plural rafƒ´qƒÅn) were supposedly ready to conduct any task for the Ismaili community. However, in the late Alamut period, the fida'is probably formed a special corps. They had a strong group sentiment and solidarity. The Nizaris viewed their assassinations, in particular those of the well-guarded, notorious targets which required a sacrificial assassination by a fida'i, as acts of heroism. Rolls of honors containing their names and their victims were kept at Alamut and other fortresses. They saw a humane justification in this method, as the assassination of a single prominent enemy served to save the lives of many other men on the battlefield. The missions were performed publicly as much as possible in order to intimidate other enemies. The assassination of a town's prominent figure often triggered the Sunni population to massacre all (suspected) Ismailis in that town.

The centreline of the intake system was gently curved, presumably to line up the intake face with the flow-field of the missile nose section. The combustion chamber flame-holder consisted of a center-body pilot region, with three annular V-gutters interconnected by slanted radial V-gutters. Fuel jets were of variable area design. A heat-shield, with multiple exit ports, provided cooling air for the jetpipe and the fixed area ratio convergent-divergent propelling nozzle.

This is the third of a series of five ReVisioning books which reconstruct and reinterpret U.S. history from marginalized peoples' perspectives. On July 23, 2019, An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States for Young People was also published by same press which is an adaptation by Jean Mendoza and Debbie Reese of Dunbar-Ortiz's original volume.  Synopsis  An Indigenous Peoples‚Äô History of the United States describes and analyzes a four hundred year span of Indigenous resistance to the colonization of the Americas . The book highlights resultant conflicts, wars, and Indigenous strategies and sites of resistance. This is known as a bottom-up method of history telling that reframes United States nation-building by highlighting and centering Indigenous stories into a unique historical narrative. The book's contents across many chronological chapters challenge what Dunbar-Ortiz articulates as the founding mythology of the burgeoning country, bolstered in the 19th century by the concept of Manifest Destiny and the Doctrine of Discovery. In the book, Dunbar-Ortiz seeks to show \\"how policy against the Indigenous peoples was colonialist and designed to seize the territories of the original inhabitants, displacing or eliminating them\\". It details how the myth rose out of the imperatives of settler colonialism and graphically depicts this as the seizure of the original inhabitants' territories and subsequent displacement and elimination of them through genocidal practices. One manifestation of the myth and expression of the genocide is identified as the movement to Kill the Indian, Save the Man. Also described is the predominance of anti-Indigenous practices and values celebrated in popular culture in the 19th and 20th centuries through writers like James Fenimore Cooper, especially in his novel and the subsequent cinematic renditions of Last of the Mohicans; Henry David Thoreau; Walt Whitman; and in D.W. Griffith's enormously popular Birth of a Nation. Beyond popular culture, An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States details how such policies, practices, and values were manifest through the ranks of the U.S. military to the highest offices of government.  Reception  The Human Rights Campaign recommended reading and discussing the book as one means of dealing responsibly with Thanksgiving. Summit Daily and CounterPunch reviewed it, with the latter highlighting one theme of the book: how historical figures held values that were consistent with genocide while not immediately associated it. Salon posted an excerpt about it on Columbus Day. Among the various reviews, early 21st century issues and tensions in the U.S. have been highlighted. Indigenous press and other press regularly inclusive of Indigenous news, too, have put forth reviews, such as the Tribal College Journal, and the Sante Fe New Mexican. Recognition of the book's value has also come in the form of praise and awards such as that from Robin D. G. Kelley, author of Freedom Dreams, suggesting this is the most important book on the subject of U.S. history. In 2015, it received the American Book Award and the PEN Oakland-Josephine Miles Award for Excellence in Literature.

When caught, he openly admitted his actions, adding that he had never given more than one bill to anyone, so no person had lost more than one dollar. He was sentenced to one year and one day in prison, and a one-dollar fine, and later sold the rights to his story which was made into the 1950 film Mister 880.  Early and personal life  Emerich Juettner was born in January, 1876 in Austria to a working-class family. He was the oldest of 4 siblings, having two brothers and a sister. On June 21, 1890, at the age of 13, he arrived in New York. He found work as a picture frame gilder before marrying Florence LeMein in 1902 at the age of 26. His wife gave birth to a son, Walter in 1903, and a daughter, Florence, in 1918. To support his family, he began working as a maintenance man and building superintendent in New York's Upper East Side. His job allowed him and his family to live rent free in the basement of the building where he worked. After his wife died in 1937, he became a junk collector.  Counterfeiting scheme  After his wife's death, Juettner had limited financial means. In 1938, Juettner began using ten to twelve homemade counterfeited bills a week in select stores in the neighborhoods of Manhattan. Over the following ten years, Juettner continued to use his counterfeited bills sparingly, never repeating storefronts or tenders. The bills were always poorly made on cheap paper and included details such as Washington being misspelled \\"Wahsington.\\" After Juettner used his first bill at a local cigar shop, the Secret Service opened Case File 880 in what began a decade-long search. He became impossible to track down, since the bills were low profile and were used so rarely in new places each time. In 1948, the counterfeiting came to an end. After a fire in his apartment building, Juettner decided to throw out his destroyed counterfeiting materials into the street. Once snowfall came, the materials were effectively hidden. Later on, a group of children found several of Juettner's $1 bills and took them to their parents. The parents subsequently reported the found bills to the Secret Service. Upon arrival to his apartment, Juettner was arrested. He was later sentenced to one year and one day in prison, and a one-dollar fine.  Response from the media  In 1949, American journalist St. Clair McKelway wrote a series in The New Yorker about several different crimes. McKelway covered Juettner's story over a three part series detailing counterfeiting in America and Juettner's life and scheme, later developing his story into a book. Entitled Annals of Crime, the series was combined with several comics and illustrations.  Legacy  Former Secret Service Director James Maloney blamed Juettner for the rise in counterfeiting incidents in the United States.  In popular culture  = Mister 880 = The life of Emerich Juettner inspired the 1950 comedy film Mister 880, directed by Edmund Goulding and starring Burt Lancaster as the Secret Service agent in charge of the investigation and Edmund Gwenn (in a supporting role) as the character based on Juettner. The film was based on St. Clair McKelway's article on Juettner. Gwenn won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in Mister 880. Ultimately, Juettner made more money from the release of Mister 880 than he had made by counterfeiting. = The 20th Century Fox Hour - \\"The Moneymaker\\" = An episode of The 20th Century Fox Hour, titled \\"The Moneymaker\\", was based on the movie and first aired on October 31, 1956.

Life  Myrta Lockett was born in Halifax County, Virginia on December 7, 1857. She was born to Harwood and Augusta Lockett. She married Georgian physician James Corbin Avary in 1884 and moved to Atlanta, Georgia. They had a son who died in infancy. In Atlanta, Avary wrote for multiple publications, including the Atlanta Journal, Atlanta Constitution, and Atlanta Georgian. In 1880, she with Dr. Avary moved to New York and they separated in 1911. Avary wrote for more publications there, such as the Christian Herald. Avary mostly wrote on Southern history in addition to metropolitan charities. She is the author of the book A Virginia Girl in the Civil War published in 1903. She was also one of the editors for Mary Boykin Chesnut's Diary From Dixie (1905). In 1906, she wrote Dixie After the War. She also helped in relief work in India, China, and Cuba. In 1908, she returned to Atlanta, and continued working in journalism. She published The Recollections of Alexander H. Stephens in 1910 and Uncle Remus and the Wren's Nest, and of Joel Chandler Harris and his Home in 1913. She died on February 14, 1946 in Atlanta.  Avary's works  Avary's earliest novel was Dixie After the War, published in 1906. The book is a portrayal of the Reconstruction-era South based on firsthand accounts. The novel details different hardships that Southerners faced as a result of the Civil War's outcome, and also includes information on the rise of secret Southern groups. Four years later, in 1910, the next work that Avary published was The Recollections of Alexander H. Stephens. Alexander Hamilton Stephens was the Vice President of the Confederate States of America and, while in Union custody, he kept a journal, which is what Avary would later publish. Myrta Lockett Avary's final work was Uncle Remus and the Wren's Nest, which was an account of Joel Chandler Harris's famous and controversial collection of Uncle Remus stories.  Descendants  Academy Award-winning film writer, producer, and director Roger Avary is a descendant of Myrta Lockett Avary.

It was acquired by the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library in 2016. History Larissa Leclair started the collection in 2010. It was first inspired by Leclair's frustration, in 2009, with not having a centralized place to find self- published photobooks. Prior to its acquisition by the Beinecke, Leclair regularly organized exhibits drawn from the collection, and it has traveled within the U.S., and to Canada, Guatemala, China, Mexico, the Philippines, and Australia. The collection was closed to submissions in 2016, so serves as a unique snapshot of artistic self-publishing from around 2008 to 2016. It also served as a center for advocacy for self-published photobooks during a time period that saw self-publishing rise as an important alternative to the large expensive photobooks produced by traditional publishing houses. Location In 2016 the collection was acquired by the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University, where it complements existing collections in the history of photography.

Incidents  * On January 7, a Colonial Pipeline line leak resulted from equipment failure in Fountain Inn, South Carolina, spilling about 52,000 gallons of petroleum product, of which around 8,000 gallons was not recovered. * On January 10, a 12-inch PSNC gas transmission pipeline exploded and burned in Asheville, North Carolina. The cause was damage to the pipeline during installation in 2003. There were no injuries, but the costs of property damage was around $825,000. * On January 29, about 600 people were evacuated from their homes & businesses, after the gas distribution system were over pressurized, in Lansing, Michigan. * On February 10, a gas pipeline exploded and burned near Tioga, North Dakota. There were no injuries. * On February 13, a 30-inch diameter Columbia Gulf Transmission gas pipeline carrying natural gas exploded near Knifley, Kentucky, sending two people to the hospital with injuries, destroying two houses, and alarming residents, who saw flames from miles away. Later, it was determined that Hydrogen embrittlement had caused the pipe failure from when the pipeline was installed in 1965. * On February 19, a leaking gas main caused a gas build up in a nearby rowhouse, that exploded in [Baltimore, Maryland], killing one youth, and seriously injuring another walking by the area. 3 other people had minor injuries. The area on the gas main near the leak had been patched twice in previous months. * On March 6, contractors working for Shell Oil Company hit Shell's Houston-to- Houma (Ho-Ho) crude oil pipeline near Port Neches, Texas, spilling 364 barrels of crude oil. * 2014 East Harlem gas explosion: On March 12, there was a gas explosion in New York City, New York. NTSB investigators found natural gas in the soil nearby, indicating that the gas leak had existed for a while before the explosion. * On March 17, a 20-inch Mid-Valley Pipeline Company pipeline failed in Hamilton County, Ohio, spilling about 18,900 gallons of crude oil into an adjacent wildlife preserve. Animals in the area were affected. The cause was environmental cracking. * On March 18, a 3-inch, half-mile flare waste gas pipeline in a neighborhood in Arvin, California, was discovered leaking, a few blocks from Arvin High School, in a residential area. It had been leaking for as long as two years. * On March 31, a pipeline running to a Williams Companies LNG storage facility in Plymouth, Washington exploded and sent shrapnel flying that ruptured an LNG storage tank. Nearly 1,000 residents were evacuated and at least five employees at the facility were injured. * A 12-inch Williams Companies gas pipeline failed at a weld in Moundsville, West Virginia. The following explosion and fire explosion scorched trees over a 2-acre area near Moundsville. Several houses were evacuated as a precaution. There were no injuries reported. * On April 17, a private excavator accidentally cut a gas line while doing some work in Union Township, Licking County, Ohio. The man suffered second degree burns to the upper portion of his body. There was no damage to any buildings. * On April 23, an explosion and fire hit a Williams Companies gas processing plant in Opal, Wyoming. All 95 residents of the town were evacuated, and part of US Highway 30 was closed for a time. * On May 6, Sinclair Oil Corporation pipeline operators detected a pressure drop on a pipeline, with the problem being traced two days later to a leak in Knox County, Missouri. A mixture of gasoline and diesel fuel contaminated soil on a farm. * On May 12, three workers from Plantation Pipeline inadvertently ruptured their pipeline at a pump station in Anderson County, South Carolina, causing a geyser of gasoline, and spraying the workers with it. There was no fire, but the workers had to be decontaminated at a hospital. * On May 17, at Port St. John, Florida, Kinder Morgan's 36\\" Florida Gas Transmission pipeline ruptured, forcing evacuation of seven homes and halting train traffic through Brevard Co. for three hours near the Florida Power & Light plant. Florida Gas Transmission workers searched for a leak when pressure dropped in the line. Homes, vehicle and train traffic were reopened after the remaining gas escaped from the pipe. This pipeline failure caused $177,321 in property damage. * On June 26, near East Bernard, Texas, a gas pipeline adjacent to a Kinder Morgan gas compressor plant blew out, destroying the roadway and setting a nearby truck on fire just south of Highway 59. Flames as high as 150 feet were shooting out of the pipeline. The focus was on a 27-inch pipeline that sends gasoline to different tank farms along the line. * On July 10, a vent stack at a Williams Field Services gas pipeline compressor station in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania caught fire. Only minor damage was reported at other parts of the station. * On July 23, in Milledgeville, Georgia, Midway Elementary School faculty and staff were evacuated due to a fire, caused by a gas leak at nearby Southern Natural Gas Co. tap station. Fire rescue personnel closed down Highway 441 South for an hour. Due to the amount of pressure, precautionary measures were taken so pipe wouldn't rupture under the road while Southern Natural Gas tried to determine the cause of the leak. \\"It could be some type of failure in a valve or regulator. Right now we don't know but Southern Natural Gas is looking into it.\\" No injuries were reported.Felicia Cummings, \\"Gas leak near Midway Elementary,\\" The Union-Recorder, July 23, 2014 4:15 pm  Updated: August 7, 2014. * On August 4, a Greka 6-inch underground oil pipeline spilled over 1,200 gallons of crude oil south of Orcutt, California.

Texas City fire officials said that company officials reported that there had been issues with the pump station over the weekend. There were no injuries. * On January 14, during work to free a trapped inline inspection unit, a leak was discovered on the Evangeline Pipeline, near Cameron Parish, Louisiana. This pipeline had been given a Corrective Action Order in October 2014, due to a number of leaks. * Also on January 14, a gas pipeline exploded near the Ross Barnett Reservoir in Brandon, Mississippi, creating a sizable crater in the ground and burning 6 acres of vegetation before the fire was extinguished. No injuries were reported. The failure was due to a \\"hard spot\\" from manufacturing, that already had a repair sleeve on it. There are 788 sleeves on the Index 129 pipeline from Edna, Texas, to Sterlington, Louisiana; and, 726 sleeves on the Index 130 pipeline from Marchand Junction, Louisiana to Kosciusko, Mississippi. Both were built from pipe made in 1952. * On January 16, a transmission pipeline operated by Kinder Morgan subsidiary Southern Natural Gas had an equipment malfunction in Walthall County, Mississippi. The cause was cold weather; ice build-up caused a regulator to malfunction.Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration operator data, http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov. , Retrieved April 1, 2016. * On January 17, oil from a broken pipeline seeped into the Yellowstone River, and contaminated the water supply 10 miles south of Glendive, Montana. The release was from Bridger Pipeline LLC's 12-inch Poplar line, which can carry 42,000 barrels a day of crude from the Bakken Formation and runs from Canada south to Baker, Montana. Bridger Pipeline is a subsidiary of True Cos., a privately held Wyoming-based company. The company said in a statement that the pipeline was shut down within an hour of the leak. About 30,000 gallons of crude were spilled, with about 28,000 gallons of crude being lost. * On January 21, a petroleum products pipeline in Honolulu, Hawaii ruptured, due to external corrosion, spilling about 42,000 gallons of petroleum product, of which about 22,000 gallons was lost. * On January 21, a crude oil pipeline pump station caught fire northwest of Texas City, Texas. Texas City fire officials said that company officials reported that there had been issues with the pump station over the weekend. * On January 26, a 20-inch Enterprise Products ATEX pipeline carrying ethane exploded and burned, in Brooke County, West Virginia. Despite snow in the area, five acres of woodlands burned, and 1,283,000 gallons of ethane were consumed, or lost. The fireball melted siding on nearby homes and damaged power lines; it is believed that day‚Äôs snowy weather lessened the damage. Reports suspect a girth weld failure from ductile tensile overload, with the pipeline being less than two years old. Survey showed that the pipeline had slumped three feet since being built. A geotechnical survey conducted by Pennsylvania Soil and Rock determined that the failed pipe was installed across a transition area or ‚Äúhead wall‚Äù of an old underground mine and surface strip mine. There were no injuries. * On January 29, near Bowling Green, Missouri, a rupture in a Rockies Express 42-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline blew a 20 by 20-foot crater and forced a six-hour evacuation of 50 families. The rupture occurred in a vacant field a few yards east of Pike County Road 43. Strong winds dissipated gas until a temporary cap was put in place. This explosion did $2,672,345 in property damage and was caused by a faulty weld; the pipe was manufactured in 2008.Operator Information, Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov * On February 10 in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, low temperatures caused freezing rain to do \\"natural force damage\\" to a Kinder Morgan Tennessee Gas Pipeline, causing $55,150 worth of property damage. * On February 17, a suspected electrical arc made a hole in a Marathon Petroleum pipeline in Shively, Kentucky, spilling about 6,700 gallons of jet fuel. More than 2,500 tons of soil were removed to clean up the area. * On February 25, a 26-inch crude oil pipeline in Navarro County near the Town of Dawson, Texas, failed, spilling about 50 barrels of crude oil. Near the failure, investigation showed that the pipe had lost about 80% of its thickness due to external corrosion. This anomaly was not seen in a 2011 test of this pipeline. * On March 2, a Kinder Morgan Tennessee Gas Pipeline leaked due to equipment failure, causing $281,890 of property damage in Marshall, Mississippi. The pipe was manufactured in 1944. * On March 13 a pipeline Patrol pilot identified an oil sheen on a pond near Tehuacana Creek, Texas which was then linked to a leaking 10 inch petroleum products pipeline. About 50 barrels of diesel fuel were spilled. * On March 20, a pipe owned by Kinder Morgan subsidiary Southern Natural Gas failed in Rolling Fork, Mississippi; the pipe was manufactured in 1930. * On March 23, another Southern Natural Gas pipeline failed due to a cracked weld at Augusta, Georgia, causing $311,785 in property damage. * On April 9, 2 Williams Companies pipelines broke within hours of each other in Marshall County, West Virginia. A 4-inch condensate pipeline broke at 8 pm local time, spilling about 132 barrels of condensate into a creek. Around 10:50 pm local time, a 12-inch gas pipeline ruptured. There was no fire or injuries. Heavy rains were said to be the cause of the failures. * On April 13, a Kinder Morgan / Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America pipeline exploded and burned near Borger, Texas. One home was evacuated, but there were no injuries. The explosion, caused by equipment failure due to environmental cracking, caused $455,000 in property damage. A 60-foot section and a 30-foot section of pipe were ejected and landed about 60 feet and 100 feet away from the failure site, respectively. Metallurgical analysis revealed the cause of the leak was stress corrosion cracking. The pipe was manufactured in 1967.PHMSA Corrective Action Orders 4-2003-1008H, 4-2012-1011H and CPF No. 4-2015-1006H, http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420151006H/420151006H_Corrective%20Action%20Order_04172015_text.pdf, accessed 1/12/2016. * On April 17, a 12-inch natural gas pipeline near Fresno, California operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company was ruptured by a backhoe.

Analysis concluded that high water flow in the river eroded the cover over the pipeline and scoured away the soil support under the pipeline. Once the pipeline was exposed as a free span, rushing water caused vertical oscillation of the pipe, resulting in metal fatigue, cracking the pipe adjacent to a girth weld. The pipe was manufactured in 1952. * On June 9 in Moorehouse Parish, Louisiana, Kinder Morgan's Tennessee Gas Pipeline equipment failed due to environmental cracking, and leaked, causing $73,395 in property damage. The pipe was manufactured in 1948. * On June 9, a 24-inch natural gas pipeline ruptured in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. About 130 individuals were evacuated from their homes. No injuries or damage reported. There was no fire. The cause was stress corrosion cracking. The pipe was installed in 1963. When it failed, it was owned by Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company. * On June 10, Kinder Morgan's El Paso Natural Gas control/relief equipment failed and leaked in Gray County, Texas. Technicians believed debris or trash may have caused the valve to malfunction. * On June 13, an Energy Transfer Partners 42-inch gas gathering pipeline exploded and burned near Cuero, Texas. Seven homes were evacuated, but there were no injuries. The heat from the flames melted electric lines, cutting off power to 130 homes. Sixteen people were evacuated from homes near the explosion, which caused $500,000 in damage. Energy Transfer Company reported to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality that as much as 165,732 pounds of volatile organic compounds burned. The Railroad Commission of Texas, in its Pipeline Safety Evaluation, and Inspection Package number 111385, published November 2, 2015, concluded that material failure, as a result of bending stress overload that caused a weld to fail, led to the rupture, explosion, and fire. The pipeline was constructed and installed in 2012.Sara Sneath, \\"Pipeline operator won't be penalized for explosion,\\" Victoria Advocate, December 6, 2015, https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2015/dec/06/pipeline-operator-wont-be- penalized-for-explosion/ A copy of the investigative report is posted on this website. * On June 15, Kinder Morgan's Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America equipment failed adjacent to a weld seam for unknown causes, with $260,555 of property damage in Marshall, Texas (that area's third documented Kinder Morgan leak).

It was renamed the Roxy Theatre in the early 1930s and assumed its final name, the Broadway Theatre, in 1937. It was located on the southwest corner of Bay and Queen streets at 75 Queen Street West. The Broadway was initially a traditional Burlesque theatre. In 1933, it was renamed the Roxy and offered girlie shows. In 1935, the theatre's manager was murdered in his office. $378 appeared to have been stolen, but, according to author and cinema historian Doug Taylor, Toronto Police did not believe robbery was the motive. The shooter was never identified. Taylor wrote that when New City Hall was to be built on the north side of the street, politicians felt that the Broadway and the Casino Theatre, another Burlesque theatre just five doors west, pawn shops and the block's other businesses were inconsistent with civic dignity, and the whole block was expropriated and demolished in 1965.

It is usually performed by exposing the alignment chemical ('command surface') to polarized light with desired orientation which then aligns the liquid crystal cells or domains to the exposed orientation. The advantages of photoalignment technique over conventional methods are non-contact high quality alignment, reversible alignment and micro-patterning of liquid crystal phases.  History  Photoalignment was first demonstrated in 1988 by K. Ichimura on Quartz substrates with an azobenzene compound acting as the command surface. Since then several chemical combinations have been demonstrated for photoalignment and applied in production of liquid crystal devices like modern displays.  Advantages  Traditionally, liquid crystals are aligned by rubbing electrodes on polymer covered glass substrates. Rubbing techniques are widely used in mass production of liquid crystal displays and small laboratories as well. Due to the mechanical contact during rubbing, often debris are formed resulting in impurities and damaged products. Also, static charge is generated by rubbing which can damage sensitive and increasingly miniature electronics in displays. Many of these problems can be addressed by photoalignment. * Photoalignment is by definition a non-contact process. This allows alignment of liquid crystals even in mechanically inaccessible areas. This has immense implications in use of liquid crystals in telecommunications and organic electronics. * By optical imaging, very small domains can be aligned which results in extremely high quality alignments. * By varying the orientation of liquid crystal alignment on a microscopic scale, thin film optical devices can be created like lens, polarizer, optical vortex generator, etc.  References  Category:Liquid crystals Category:Optical materials Category:Cleanroom technology ","title":"Photoalignment"},{"id":"58665949","text":"Charles Stuart of Dunearn FRSE (1745-1826) was a Scottish minister who went on to co-found the Royal Society of Edinburgh and to be President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.

It was designed and established by Alexander Macleay and built from 1827 by George Macleay, his son). It is also known as Lowe's Hill and Glendaruel (Glendaurel). The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 January 2001.  History  =Indigenous history= =Colonial history= When Governor Lachlan Macquarie toured the Cow Pastures in 1815 he traversed the area from the foot of in a north-west direction toward Mount Hunter Creek (Rivulet) and then in a northern direction towards the Nepean River. At the close of the day he wrote that \\"it is my intention to form an establishment here for at least three separate herds of the Government horned cattle, at three distinct stations\\". The main farm and Government Cottage was established at Cawdor which Macquarie made his base on his return tour in 1822. On Friday 11 January 1815 Macquarie inspected another of the stations from Cawdor along Mount Hunter Creek to Brownlow. Originally called Lowe's Hill, Governor Macquarie renamed it to Brownlow Hill in 1820 at the request of Commissioner Bigge, in honour of his friend Lord Brownlow.Kingston, 1990 Peter Murdock, who accompanied Macquarie, was later (in the mid-1820s)Carlin, 2008 granted to the north-west of Mount Hunter rivulet in the parish of Werombi. A small cottage now referred to as \\"the roundhouse\\" is situated on this grant, which was known locally as Glendaruel (Glendaurel), and it is believed that this cottage may have been associated with the Government station established by Macquarie. Although it is similar in form to the former gatehouse at Winbourne, Mulgoa and a residence at Molong (late 1830s), both of these are now demolished.National Trust, 2000 Macleay family The , later surveyed as , of land to its north, Brownlow Hill, the former Government stock farm was a grant by purchase to Colonial Secretary Alexander Macleay in May 1827. Macleay purchased Murdock's adjacent grant, known as Glenderual (or Glendaruel, Glendaurel) in November 1828 for A‚Ç§3,000. The amalgamated Brownlow Hill and Glenderual estates were managed by Macleay's sons George (1805-1891) and James Robert (1811-1892) from 1828 and by George following James Macleay's departure for England in 1837. Once stocked, the property was left in the care of an overseer. In May 1828 Alexander's son, George Macleay, who had arrived in November 1827, was managing the farm at Brownlow Hill, where he had erected a cottage by early 1829. Farming duties were to be shared with his brother James. In February 1828 Fanny Macleay described Brownlow Hill, a description that is also relevant to Glenderual: On 21 November 1829 Fanny Macleay reported on her brother George's departure on Sturt's expedition along the Murray and Darling Rivers (a blazed tree near the Round House commemorates the starting point for this expedition), adding: In November 1833 she wrote \\"farming affairs look very ill for there has been no rain for many a day\\" and on 12 December 1833: Within George Macleay's period of residency (1828-1859) until recent times Brownlow Hill was to be tenant farmed with the Glenderual river flats designated Farm no. 4. Sidman's account of the history of the area, written in the 1930s, claims that the first home was on the flat above Mt Hunter Creek and that a stone quarry was opened on the estate, although this is not corroborated by other authors. Despite a lack of detail, there are references to her brothers\` improvements on the farm in letters sent by Fanny Macleay to William, another brother in Cuba, and when Baron von Hugel who visited the \\"charming house\\" in 1834 as it was nearing completion. Von Hugel considered the farm (Glendaurel), two miles away from the new house, as having no equal of any he had seen in NSW for its 'cleanliness and orderliness\`, and differing considerably from others such as Regentville, possessed paddocks cleared of stumps. A large garden and a small pond with many platypus adjoined the farm which von Hugel commented 'would certainly be better located near the homestead, when this is completed\\".National Trust (NSW), 2000. The Round House is popularly believed to have been one of the government herdsmen's' huts built by Macquarie in the 1810s. However, the Picturesque taste evident in its design (and also the design of Brownlow Hill and its landscape) suggests the hand of the Macleay family. Its octagonal form is unusual in Australia although similar designs (typically for gate lodges) were adapted for the gate lodge at the Cox property, Winbourne, Mulgoa (sketched by Hardy Wilson in 1916 for his Old Colonial Architecture in New South Wales and Tasmania (the lodge has since been demolished), the Betts property, the Round House, Vale Head, Molong (demolished) and an 1830s house associated with St Patrick's Church, Singleton. A comparable and contemporary house is Chief Justice Francis Forbes' Edinglassie, Emu Plains (c. 1826, demolished). James Broadbent, in \\"The Australian Colonial House\\" writes that 'Edinglassie was a simplified, antipodean version of the rustic cottage ornes popularised by Papworth in Ackermann's Repository of Arts, Literature, Fashions & c., or his own Rural Residences [1818]'. About south of the Round House is a quarry in the Flaggy Creek bed, a tributary of the Mount Hunter Rivulet. The quarry was a source of Wiannamatta stone (advertised in the press of the 1820s - '30s as Cowpastures stone), a highly-figured mudstone used for paving (i.e. flagstones) at Brownlow Hill (the console table base, veranda and entrance hall flagging) and Elizabeth Bay House (the entrance hall and flagging, saloon stair and upper floor chimneypieces). The Camden Park portico columns are reputedly from this quarry. The quarry provides a rare instance of a surviving connection between early houses and the source of their materials and is an important archaeological site. Records held by the Botanic Gardens indicate that G. Macleay Esquire was sent a number of plants during this period. In June 1832 he was sent 12 olive Plants and 6 ornamental shrubs and in July 1834: 50 vine cuttings, 1 Evergreen Oak, 2 White Broom and 12 ornamental shrubs. As one of the Colony's prominent farmers, George Macleay received two sets of cuttings, 40 from Mr Busby's vines, one set being for Captain Dumaresq in June 1836. Conrad Martens drew Brownlow Hill homestead in 1836 showing that it was sited on a flattened hill which was not completely cleared of its native vegetation. Adjacent land to the west was added to the property through a grant to George Macleay. In 1836 George Macleay wrote to his sister requesting Loudon's Encyclopaedia of Gardening. Macleay's ornamental additions of a sundial bearing the inscription \\"George Macleay 1836\\" and a Maldon sandstone vase on a pedestal situated in the centre of flower beds cut in the lawn are clear indications of the sophistication with which the garden was planned and developed. Other additions such as the aviary in the flower garden appear to have been inspired by Thomas Shepherd's lectures and modelled on illustrations and ideas, especially Mrs Lawrence's garden Drayton Green, from Loudon's Gardener's Magazine, many illustrations and articles from which appeared in his 1838 publication\\" The Suburban Gardener and Villa Companion\\". Although not substantiated, it is likely that George Macleay had assistance in implementing ideas gleaned from his reading. The 1865 obituary in the Horticultural Magazine and Gardeners' and Amateurs' Calendar, for Robert Henderson, the gardener at Alexander Macleay's Elizabeth Bay at the time of von Hugel's Sydney visit, stated that he \\"had severally superintended the laying out of the gardens appertaining to the late residence of George Macleay, Esq \\". More plants were sent from the Botanic Gardens to George Macleay in 1844 - the most unusual inclusion for the time was Eucalypts and Melaleuca - trees not usually planted by the colonists, especially in the country. By February L'Avergne was \\"very busy with grapes\\", preparing enough for 30 gallons of wine. Journal entries in March mention figs, a new white grape named 'Cornoshant\\" and walnuts growing in the garden. Both the von Hugel and Boswell accounts indicate clear connections between William Macarthur at Camden Park and the Macleays at Brownlow Hill. Sales of plants noted in William Macarthur's notebooks indicate that during the early 1850s a number of significant additions were made to the garden, some of which are a feature of the property today. Samuel Mossman and Thomas Banister visited Brownlow Hill at this time, approaching the estate from Vanderville, the property of John Wild(e), which encompassed the village now known as The Oaks. They passed over a range of hills, likely the area now known as Glenmore. On an 1848 visit George Macleay's niece (daughter of his sister Margaret) Annabella Boswell commented:Boswell, A., (1848, in) 1992, 5. Sidman's account of Brownlow Hill states that in the 1850s 'the property was leased for pig raising - when much damage was done to the beautiful growth surrounding. Downes family management When George and Barbara Macleay returned to England in 1859, the property was leased by Jeremiah Downes. Brownlow Hill was sold to Severin K Salting in 1862 and again leased to Downes who purchased the property from Salting in 1875. In the intervening period it was managed as a series of tenant farms, a practice also adopted by the Macarthur family on the part of their nearby Camden Park Estate known as Cawdor Farms. Martens sketched \\"the well-established garden at Brownlow Hill in 1871 and species depicted then are still clearly recognisable in the garden. The Martens sketch also shows, some 30 odd years after his initial rendition of the place, the relationship between the homestead with the river flats below and the juxtaposition of the gardened hill top with the lightly vegetated distant hills. The property, which was inherited by Jeremiah's son Frederick Downes in 1887, and also sketched by architect, writer and promoter of colonial heritage, William Hardy Wilson, is still owned by the Downes family and managed as a dairy. The Round House was known as Monk's Cottage by c.1900, having been home to one or two generations of tenant dairy farmers, who also gave their name to Monks Lane, which runs north from Burragorang Road, Mount Hunter. Hardy Wilson sketched the Round House and overshadowed by a large Angophora tree for the plate \\"Great Apple-Oak at Cobbitty\\" for his book, \\"The Cowpasture Road\\" (1920). In the text he noted that the angophora had recently fallen. Its stump was evident to c.1960. Glendon, another 19th century dwelling, is situated at the north of the property. When John Fairfax wrote his account of the early properties around Sydney, he remarked that Brownlow Hill was \\"as beautiful now as it was then\\" and that J.B. Martin (fl.1831 -1908) reminisced that Mr Macleay was the \`best man in the district for mixed farming and dairying and Brownlow Hill was used as a 'receiving place for the wool and fat stock from the large Murrumbidgee stations.' Trevor Allen, James Broadbent and Howard Tanner mapped the garden c.1969 as part of their joint architectural thesis at the University of Sydney. This thesis was on colonial gardens. There are four dairies on the property. Aerial photography from 1947 and 1969 clearly indicates a pattern of farming on the property which is almost identical today - the western portion of the property used for grazing only and the alluvial flats for cropping. It is likely that the agricultural use of the land has remained relatively unchanged since the 19th century. One change from the 1960s has been the establishment of a quarry on the western extremity on the property, although this has had little impact on the working farm.National Trust of Australia, 2000. The Round House was known as Monk's Cottage by , having been home to one or two generations of tenant dairy farmers, who also gave their name to Monks Lane, north of Burragorang Road, Mount Hunter. Diana Wilson (nee Downes) was born on Brownlow Hill at Glendon, married and left the farm before returning to Monk's Cottage in 1960. When her familoy originally came there, the house was in ruinous condition, having been flooded on numerous occasions. The collapsed central chimney (the surviving roof battens indicate it was octagonal) and dividing wall was taken out to make its original two small rooms into a sitting room. A room was added to connect the Round House and a separate block of c.1900 and both buildings re-roofed, re- sashed and the verandah largely built by Diana's husband, Mackellar Wilson, using windows and doors made by Reg Vincent Windows, Parramatta. Limewash was stripped off the brick external walls.Everett, 2017, 12 Diana Wilson's husband Mackellar Wilson was the nephew of architect/artist, William Hardy Wilson. To the north was an orchard on a square plan (only a persimmon tree survives) bounded by funeral cypresses (Cupressus funebris), a species associated with Sir William Macarthur's nearby Camden Park nursery and the settings of Camden Park, St John's Church, Camden and Harrington Park. The garden surrounding the Round House contains old pepper trees (Schinus molle (estimated to date from the 1850s),Everett, 2017, 14 sky flower (Duranta plumieri), wisteria and honey locusts (Gleditsia triacanthos). Diana Wilson re-established the garden with Cumberland Plain staples such as white cedars (Melia azederach var.australasica), oleanders (Nerium oleander) propagated by Mackellar Wilson), pomegranate (Punica granatum), citrus, mulberry (Morus sp.), orchid tree (Bauhinia x variegata), Chinese elms (Ulmus parvifolia), crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica), jacaranda and roses. Diana and Mackellar planted a jacaranda (J.mimosifolia), given to Aunt Row as a fifth birthday present. Diana Wilson died in 2009. Her granddaughter Amy and her husband Wes moved into Monk's Cottage. Amy recalls her grandmother and husband installed an internal bathroom, verandah and concrete floor to the Round House, building a beautiful shed. Amy's father recalls bathing in the adjoining creek prior to the bathroom.Everett, 2017, 12, 14 John Downes (1916-2008) was born in Glendon, on the Brownlow Hill property, to Edgar & Isabel Downes. He was the fourth generation of Downes family to live on Brownlow Hill since Jeremiah Downes came to manage it in 1858. Schooled at the King's School in Parramatta, he loved horses and first competed in the under-eight riding event at the Camden Show. Eventually he joined the Cobbitty Polo Club and his ability led to him being on that winning team in Manila. He joined the 1st Australian Tank Battalion in World War 1 and met his future wife, Joan Whitton, at a dance for officers in Melbourne (they married in 1952). Sent to New Guinea he served under Samuel Hordern, whose outstanding leadership, both in wartime and in peace, had a profound effect.Cairncross, in SMH, 2008 From that time, Downes devoted much of his life to community service. A member of the Camden Show Society since 1938, he worked for the Society for 48 years, following the family's interest in cattle and horses. Downes joined the council of the Royal Agricultural Society of NSW in 1952 and became vice-president in 1969. He worked on eight committees and introduced the animal nursery to the Royal Easter Show. He was a member of Wollondilly Shire Council from 1959‚Äì71, including terms as deputy president. Passionate about the need to record and study long-term rainfall patterns, he continued the family tradition of collecting rainfall measurements for the Bureau of Meteorology. The family has not missed filling out a monthly report since May 1882. John is survived by Joan, daughter Eleanor, son Edgar and six grandchildren. Diana Wilson of the Round House/Monk's Cottage, died in 2009 and her granddaughter and family are undertaking minor works to modify the cottage for them to live in (pers.comm., Edgar Downes, 1/2010). A kitchen was put in (Diana still used an old wood stove, a sink and a dresser). Some electrical work, a new water tank, a new slow-combustion wood fire, repairs to the chook run and painting inside the house were undertaken. A family wedding was a major motivation for improving the house and property. Amy's sister asked to be married on the property, so these works were done, the timber verandah was improved, the very old shed in the garden was re-stumped to make it stand up straight again. A wedding marquee was placed in what was a dirt pony paddock, fences being removed and the paddock turfed. The driveway was also improved, along with lots of gardening work. A recent book on Caroline Thomas notes her daughter married into the Downes family and moved from Wivenhoe, Cobbitty to Brownlow Hill.Philp, 2015  Description  ;Landscape: Brownlow Hill has an exceptionally attractive semi natural landscape and the setting of the house is one of Australia's best surviving examples of a colonial garden. Brownlow Hill not only includes the house & garden but also the surrounding landscape. The fine brick built stables, aviary and the sandstone pond balustrade/ causeway are found within this area. The house at Brownlow Hill consists of rendered brick walls and a corrugated iron roof - originally shingle. Floors are hardwood whereas the verandah and entrance hall is sandstone-flagged. The flagging in the entrance is on the diagonal. The cedar joinery is in good condition as are the six paneled doors. Living room, dining room and main bedroom have unusual French door /windows with square glass panes extending to base. The Hall is wide and paved with sandstone, with two symmetrically placed mouldings supporting an archway. Three Georgian marble fireplaces remain within the house. The verandah is supported by \\"Hardwood Feature\\" columns. ;Grounds at Brownlow Hill: The setting of the house is one of Australia's best surviving examples of a colonial garden which includes not only the house garden but also the surrounding landscape. Within this area are numerous outstanding architectural features such as the fine brick-built stables, aviary and balustraded sandstone pond wall/causeway. Previous owners: Alex. Macleay Sir George Macleay - 1858 J. Downes - 1875 The house and flower garden occupy an artificially formed triangular plateau on the top of a small hill. The site is approached by a small lane (Brownlow Hill Loop Road) which is a tunnel like space lined with mainly African olive (Olea africana), and long leaved privet trees, but interspersed with specimen trees of Chinese elm (Ulmus chinensis), pepper trees (Schinus molle), white cedar (Melia azederach var. australasica), nettle tree (Celtis sp.) and white poplar trees (Populus alba). Views from the lane into the farm, across the flood plain fields and up the small hills are available along the Loop Road. Remnant hardwood fencing lines the road, of mainly two beam split hardwood farm fencing. Some stumps remain in the driveway hedgerows of earlier avenue plantings of stone pines (Pinus pinea). The house drive is heralded by the brick and sandstone stables and former orchard/vegetable garden/paddock before the gates are reached. The gates are framed by picket fencing, four pillars and a homestead sign. Immediately within the gates on the left is an artificially formed pond built up with a balustraded sandstone retaining wall, partly covered in dwarf creeping fig (Ficus pumila) and urns on the northern edge to carry the drive which then turns right and climbs the hill, skirts a dense bamboo thicket, then clipped hedges of box and thickets overgrown predominantly with African olives and large leaved privet. The drive culminates in an irregular oval carriage loop to the house, which is filled with Agapanthus, Aloe and Agave species. A collection of mature bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pines (A.cunninghamiana), succulent Agave species and palms occupies this part of the garden, including the rare fat trunked Chilean wine palm, (Jubaea chilensis). The carriage loop occupies the \\"base\\" of the triangle of the plateau, the house in the centre, and \\"allee\\" with side-wards views over the flood-plane along the left hand (northern) side continuing In a lesser walk along the other side and the flower garden and aviary occupy the apex The ground falls sharply from the right and left sides of the triangle (i.e. in an arc from NW to SE). On the latter side irregular sandstone steps lead down to a lower garden now overgrown with privet, olive and bamboo. Two more Chilean wine palms are located at the southern base of the hill, near the orchard/vegetable garden/paddock. ;Characteristic Components: The stables/Carriage House is a fine brick building with \\"Marulan\\" sandstone lintels; vaguely Palladian (ie tripartite facade with single storied sides, pedimented centre with loft). This is the first indication when approaching Brownlow Hill of the sophistication of its design. Date of construction unknown, probably late 1830s. The carriage house is in good condition. The urn and balustrade-edged pond is well known from the illustration in W Hardy Wilson's \\"Old Colonial Architecture\\". The drive edges the northern side with 1 low solid stone balustrade, now overgrown with dwarf creeping fig, Ficus pumila, surmounted at intervals by urns which appear to be composition rather than natural stone. Further urns once decorated a return to this wall on the eastern side. This has now collapsed. The pond is planted with water lilies. The drive is well maintained gravel drive bordered by box hedges (uneven and incomplete in parts mainly owing to overgrowth and in need of restoration). Behind these, overgrown thickets of largely self sown African olive (Olea africana) and large leaved privet, but containing along the edges a representative collection of common 19th century shrubbery plants and trees (Chinese elms, winter honeysuckle, geraniums, bay, photinia, dietes), A secondary service drive screened by the olives and privets links the coach house with the house. A large honey locust tree (Gleditsia triacanthos) is along this drive). The Aviary is probably one of the most notable architectural feature of the flower garden and a rare survival. The Aviary consists of brick built walls with nesting boxes and semi-circular gables with an \\"oil -de-boeuf\\" above twin arches (originally infilled with wire) The front gable is surmounted by a platform originally carrying a statue of a reclining figure (probably a copy of 'Dying Gaul). The roof is semi-circular , originally of iron and wire which has since been removed. Remains of wire screens exist.Stuart Read, pers. comm. 8/01 ;Garden Layout and Plantings: A large collection of mature trees crowns the hilltop and flanks it on the northern side. These include bunya and hoop pines, Himalayan chir pines (Pinus roxburghii), silky oaks (Grevillea robusta), remnant grey box (Eucalyptus moluccana), kurrajongs (Brachychiton populneum), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), pony-tail palm (Nolina sp.), crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemeria indica) and at the base of the hill to the east, a line of English oak (Quercus robur). Other trees which are naturalising amongst privets and olives are loquats (Eriobotrya japonica) and oleanders. A single specimen of native cypress, possibly Port Jackson/Oyster Bay pine (Callitris rhomboides) is to the north of the carriage loop in the \\"Victorian\\" garden. A range of shrub plantings include the now rare Italian buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus), Cape plumbago (P.capensis), Agave species, Yucca species, roses, may bush (Spiraea cantonensis), geraniums, Oleanders (Nerium oleander), shrub honeysuckle (Lonicera fragrantissima), Himalayan jasmine (Jasminium mesnyi), laurustinus (Viburnum tinus), Photinia glabra, a bay tree (Laurus nobilis), lantana (L.camara), sky flower (Duranta plumieri), mickey mouse plant (Ochna serrulata) and Cotoneasters. The flower garden is somewhat altered in the detail of its design (in paths, beds and plant material) however it still retains some of its major features. A large Marulan sandstone urn on stone pedestal still remains as does the sundial - a baluster shaped support with a brass dial bearing the inscription George Macleay 1836. The Aviary is probably one of the most notable architectural feature of the flower garden and a rare survival. The Aviary consists of brick built walls with nesting boxes and semi-circular gables with an \\"oil -de-boeuf\\" above twin arches (originally infilled with wire) The front gable is surmounted by a platform originally carrying a statue of a reclining figure (probably a copy of 'Dying Gaul). The roof is semi-circular , originally of iron and wire which has since been removed. Remains of wire screens exist. Behind the aviary are two specimens of a rare Indian medicinal plant, vasaka, (Adhatoda duvernaia/A.vasica), thought to have been introduced from India by Alexander Macleay through his correspondence with a Dr Walloch, head of the (then 1820s-30s) Calcutta Botanic Gardens.Stuart Read, pers. Comm. 8/01 To the north of the dam/pond is an area of palms, pines and a mature pecan nut tree, including Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis), cotton palm (Washingtonia robusta), clumping date palm (Phoenix reclinata), a Queensland kauri (Agathis robusta), Chilean wine palm (Jubaea chilensis), carob (Ceratonia siliqua), crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica), tree of heaven, Chinese elm, Juniperus sp., Nettle trees, Norway maple (Acer platanoides), English elms (Ulmus procera), Chir pine (Pinus roxburghii), honey flower (Melianthus major) and white poplar (Populus alba). Common ground cover plants include Dietes iridiodes, Nile lily (Agapanthus orientalis), Crassula sp., Kaffir lily (Clivea miniata), spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum), Agave & Aloe species, Cape plumbago (P.capensis). Cat's claw creeper (Doxantha unguis-cati) is a major ground cover and weed, also climbing the trunks of some major trees, and covering much of the eastern banks of the hill on which the house and garden stands. Today there are four dairies on the property. Aerial photography from 1947 and 1969 clearly indicates a pattern of farming on the property which is almost identical today - the western portion of the property used for grazing only and the alluvial flats for cropping. Several quarries exist on the property, for sandstone and shale supplies.

This was sketched by W Hardy Wilson in \\"The Cow Pasture Road\\", beside a giant Angophora tree (which even then c.1920, had fallen down). This lies on land originally granted (2000 acres) to Peter Murdock, and now part of Brownlow Hill. The place was known locally as Glendaruel or Glendaurel, and is believed to have been associated with the Government station established by Macquarie in 1815. Similar forms were known in a gatehouse at Winbourne and a residence in Molong (both now demolished), making this a rare early structure of its type. The Round House was known as Monk's Cottage by c.1900, having been home to one or two generations of tenant dairy farmers, who also gave their name to Monks Lane, which runs north from Burragorang Road, Mount Hunter. The Round House has been home to Diana Wilson (sister of John Downes of Brownlow Hill) her husband Mackellar Wilson (nephew of Hardy Wilson) and their family since 1960. When the Wilsons came to the Round House it was in ruinous condition, having been flooded on a number of occasions. The collapsed central chimney (the surviving roof battens indicate that it was octagonal) and dividing wall was taken out to make its original two small rooms into a sitting room. A room was added to connect the Round House and a separate block of c. 1900 and the buildings reroofed, resashed and the veranda largely rebuilt by Mackellar Wilson using windows and doors made by Reg Vincent of Vincent Windows, Parramatta. Limewash has been stripped from the unrendered walls. To the north was an orchard on a square plan (only a persimmon tree survives) bounded by funeral cypresses (Cupressus funebris), a species associated with Sir William Macarthur's Camden Park nursery and the settings of Camden Park, St John's Church, Camden and Harrington Park. The garden surrounding the Round House contains old pepper trees (Schinus), sky flower (Duranta plumieri), wisteria and honey locusts (Gleditsia triacanthos). Diana Wilson has re-established it with Cumberland Plain staples such as white cedars, oleanders (propagated by Mac Wilson), pomegranate, citrus, mulberry, Bauhinia, Chinese elms, crepe myrtle, jacaranda and roses. About 100 metres south of the Round House is a quarry in the Flaggy Creek bed, a tributary of the Mount Hunter Rivulet. The quarry was a source of Wiannamatta stone (advertised in the press of the 1820s - '30s as Cowpastures stone), a highly-figured mudstone used for paving (i.e. flagstones) at Brownlow Hill (the console table base, veranda and entrance hall flagging) and Elizabeth Bay House (the entrance hall and flagging, saloon stair and upper floor chimneypieces). The Camden Park portico columns are reputedly from this quarry. The quarry provides a rare instance of a surviving connection between early houses and the source of their materials and is an important archaeological site. ;General: An elaborate garden design which appears to be strongly influenced by 1830s designs in England and perhaps in particular by the ideas of John Claudius Loudon(viz the variety of features ( the use of composition is significant) juxtaposed within a relatively small space and the combining of the irregularity of a landscape garden with the smallness in scale of a \\"villa\\" garden and the formality of individual parts - a preoccupation with specific features in favour of their subjection to a general effect) More specifically the garden shows remarkable parallels in its detailing to that of the well known English horticulturist, Louisa Lawrence. The details of the sundial in parterre, the urn, and the use of casts (the Dying Gaul) surmounted Mrs Lawrence's (gabled) camellia hose. There are no similarities in the plan. The \\"Lawrencian Villa\\" as it was known was fully described and illustrated in London's \\" Suburban Garden and Villa Companion\\" in 1838. If one takes the date of the sundial as indicative of the date of the general embellishment of the garden it predates this publication. The specific influence is unproved, the generic influence is strikingly apparent. The general layout is well maintained but individual items and some overgrown areas need attention. The aviary is in urgent need of restoration.Survey of Gardens - National Trust of Australia, Broadbent, 1981 = Condition = As at 6 August 2001, the site has high archaeological potential. Much of the colonial landscape and garden is still evident. Sub-surface remnants of previous agricultural structures and/or associated artefacts may still be within the boundaries of the original allotments. ;Flaggy Creek Quarry site: About 100 metres south of the Round House is a quarry in the Flaggy Creek bed, a tributary of the Mount Hunter Rivulet. The quarry was a source of Wiannamatta stone (advertised in the press of the 1820s - '30s as Cowpastures stone), a highly-figured mudstone used for paving (i.e. flagstones) at Brownlow Hill (the console table base, veranda and entrance hall flagging) and Elizabeth Bay House (the entrance hall and flagging, saloon stair and upper floor chimneypieces). The Camden Park portico columns are reputedly from this quarry. The quarry provides a rare instance of a surviving connection between early houses and the source of their materials and is an important archaeological site. Brownlow Hill has remained relatively unchanged since the 19th century, considering the constant pattern of farming, the scenic landscape setting and most of the Brownlow Hill estate and contents has remained largely intact. = Modifications and dates = ;House Modification: The house at Brownlow Hill was originally built as two small separate wings of brick at right angles to one another, with a separate kitchen at the rear making up the third side of the Courtyard. By 1834 alterations were made transforming the house which was \\"now pronounced the best in the Colony.\\" The two small wings were joined, forming an L shaped building. The original roof endings are still to be seen beneath the present roof. Within the angles another section was then added to the east wing, On the right of the north elevation is a wing which was added by Jeremiah Downes, who bought the property In 1875. At that time the front door was replaced and a small portico built before it. A cellar is approached from the rear. In the 1890s a portico- ed entry way to the front door, and new Victorian front door, was added, along with a new wing to the west of the original house. John & Joan Downes made significant modifications in c.1961, installing two internal bathrooms in the eastern wing, a corridor connecting the entry hall with the eastern wing rooms leading to a relocated entry door, moved to be centrally placed on the eastern wing. An internal kitchen was also provided within the central wing of the house, including the removal of an internal wall between a former bedroom and scullery. A suite of works was undertaken to the main homestead in 2016-17. ;Round House/Monk's House: *1960+ modifications (see history) *2009+ modifications (see history). ;Landscape Modifications: *In the 1850s the property was leased for pig raising when much damage was done to the surrounding growth. In 1859, the property was leased by Jeremiah Downes. Brownlow Hill was sold to Severin K Salting and in 1862 was again leased to Downes who purchased the property from Salting in 1875. In the intervening period it was managed as a series of tenant farms *In the 1960s, a quarry was established on the western extremity on the property with minimal impact on the working farm. = Further information = The general layout is well maintained but individual items and some overgrown areas need attention. The aviary is in urgent need of restoration. The outer garden, lane/ Loop Road and hedgerows are in need of some weed management, to retain significant views and vistas, and control spread, particularly of African olives and privet. The olives in particular are invasive as scrub elsewhere on the farm, although this is under management. The pond/dam wall is in need of repair and some reconstruction, to prevent further cracking and slumping.  Heritage listing  As at 6 August 2001, Brownlow Hill is a rare, substantially intact colonial farming estate with an outstanding scenic landscape setting with many rare surviving early colonial structures and features. It has one of the most prominent colonial gardens and estates in Australia with the extent of its considerable acreage and pattern of farming largely intact. Brownlow Hill contains a designed landscape of national importance and renown which includes ground modeling, layout and plantings from the pre-1860s. The homestead layout and farm was established by Alexander Macleay, first Colonial Secretary of NSW and his sons George and to a lesser extent James Macleay. The site has association with government stations initiated by Macquarie. Brownlow Hill has had continuous family occupation (the Downes family) since 1859 and ownership since 1875. The site is considerably intact with a network of 19th century dwellings of a successful farm which are still in operation. Brownlow Hill is firmly placed in the consciousness of the community as one of the most evocative early European estates (colonial house, garden, landscape setting) in NSW. It has been romanticized by the well known architect, author, artist and gardener , W. Hardy Wilson (1881 - 1955).National Trust of Australia, Colonial Landscapes of the Cumberland Plain and Camden. 2000 A remarkable survival of a sophisticated colonial garden of the 1830s owned by, and probably designed by, a family notable both in colonial politics and society and internationally in the field of horticulture.Survey of Gardens in New South Wales - National Trust of Australia, 1981 Brownlow Hill Estate was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 January 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site has historical significance for the agricultural work which was undertaken within the region. The establishment of an ornamental colonial garden within a rural setting were amongst the earliest of its kind and the diversity of imported plants were unusual for the period. Aerial photography from 1947 and 1969 clearly indicates a pattern of farming on the property which is almost identical today -the western portion of the property used for grazing only and the alluvial flats for cropping. The continuity of the Downes family's occupation at Brownlow Hill enables an insight into one family's evolution evidenced by existing fabric and landscape. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The site has aesthetic significance as an important remnant of early agricultural attempts in the district that still functions as a farm with its pattern of land use intact, and an intact example of the sophistocated and conscious landscape design of an early rural estate on the Cumberland Plain. It also has rare surviving and intact colonial estate layout, features, farm plantings, ornamental gardens and structures which provide an important visual context for the former landscape, allowing opportunities for cultural and historical interpretation. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Homestead along with the adjoining land is of high social significance as one of very few sites of its type established in the region. It is of particular value for its prominent colonial gardens, and estates with considerable acreage and pattern of farming largely intact. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has technical/research significance through its association with early agricultural and pastoral activities. The site allows investigation into Colonial farming practices, landscape design and ornamental gardens. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Brownlow Hill is a rare, substantially intact colonial farming estate with surviving layout, structures and features. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The site is representative of the early attempts to develop agriculture. Brownlow Hill is also representative of Colonial landscape design.

As of early 2019 it was in a period of public consultation. The proposal has been compared to the Luas light rail system in Dublin. History From the 1880s to 1934, a light rail system existed in Cork, the Cork and Muskerry Light Railway. It closed in 1934, having sustained damage during the Irish Civil War, which hindered usage. Another tramway operated three lines around the city center and surrounding suburbs, operated by the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company. It closed in 1931, having sustained damage during the Burning of Cork, as well as the increased use of motor transportation. A light rail system was proposed as part of the Green Party manifesto in 2007. The Green Party entered as the junior partner into a coalition with Fianna F√°il after the 2007 general election. The proposals were briefly discussed in the D√°il. However, the post-2008 economic downturn began shortly afterward, and it, along with other infrastructural plans, were shelved. The proposal was mentioned in the government's Ireland 2040 framework, which was published in 2018. As of 2019, a formal transportation plan for Cork, known as the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (CMATS), was prepared by the local authority. Publication was scheduled for February 2018, with a \\"draft plan\\" proposed to be available for \\"public consultation early in 2019\\". The draft CMATS plan was published in May 2019, and included draft proposals for the construction of a light-rail system sometime after 2031. The proposed light-rail system received support from the president of UCC, Cork's largest third-level institution, and the Cork Chamber of Commerce, and Tanaiste Simon Coveney and former Lord Mayor Mary Shields. Proposed route Map of Proposed Cork light rail from the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy Plans proposed in 2017, under the Ireland 2040 development framework, had suggested an 'east-west' light-rail corridor from Ballincollig in the west of Cork City, through the city centre, to Mahon in the east. A 'north-south' corridor was also contained in these plans, linking Cork Airport. During 2018, the People Before Profit (PBP) political party proposed a variant of these routes. One two-line proposal suggested one line running from Ballincollig to Mahon, and another from Cork Airport to Cork city center. Another PBP proposal, from later in 2018, was based on three lines. In May 2019, the 'Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy' was published by the National Transport Authority, and contained proposals for a one-line system running from Ballincollig to Mahon through the city centre. The project was unveiled alongside a number of other suggested transport investments, including an expansion of the Cork Suburban Rail. The 2019 proposal was costed at ‚Ç¨1 billion, projected to include 25 possible stops along 17km of track. Determination of the final LRT route alignment was due to start in early 2020 with construction not expected to commence \\"until 2031 at earliest\\". Starting in Ballincollig, the line is proposed to run eastwards, serving locations such as Cork Institute of Technology, Cork University Hospital, University College Cork, Patrick street, Kent station, P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh and Mahon Point Shopping Centre. It has been proposed that the line would make use of disused Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway when running through Blackrock. A cyleway and improved suburban rail network was announced with plans for the light rail in July 2020.

A widespread marine environment during the Paleozoic flooded the region, depositing sedimentary rocks which cover most of the center and south of the state. Geologic history, stratigraphy and tectonics The oldest Precambrian rocks in Wisconsin are late Archean quartzofeldspathic gneiss, migmatite and amphibolite up to three billion years old and igneous rock such as the granite of the Puritan Quartz Monzonite. Mafic and intermediate metavolcanic rocks together with metasedimentary rocks are found in the Ramsey Formation in Iron County and iron formations in Jackson County. The metasediments and metavolcanics formed first, followed by granites more than 2.7 billion years ago. The rock record contains an uncertain age gap with younger 2.3 billion year old Proterozoic quartzofeldspathic and migmatite gneiss, with amphibolite and biotite schist. Around 1.9 billion years ago, mafic, intermediate and felsic rocks, in some cases with subordinate metasedimentary rocks, began to form and metamorphosed, reaching greenschist and amphibolite grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies. The Ironwood and Riverton Iron formations are recognized from aerial magnetic surveys. Metamorphosed argillite, quartzite, greywacke conglomerate and marble with small areas of interbedded metavolcaic rocks make up the Tyler Formation, Palms Quartzite and Bad River Dolomite. Taken together, these late Proterozoic rocks correlate with the Marquette Range Supergroup and are intruded by banded and layered migmatite gneiss, intermediate and granite intrusive rocks, as well as massive or foliated tonalite and granodiorite (which is itself intruded by aplite and pegmatite. Near Merrill are metamorphosed ultramafic and mafic intrusive rocks with a distinctive magnetic signature. From 1.7 to 1.6 billion years ago granite and rhyolite emplaced in south-central Wisconsin. The Baraboo and Waterloo Quartzite in the south and the Barron Quartzite in the northwest are slightly younger, along with the slate, dolomite, conglomerate and chert included in Wolf River rocks at Rib Mountain, Mosinee Hill and the McCaslin Quartzites. The Wolf River Batholith spans from Glade County in the north to the northern part of Portage County in the south. Anorthosite and gabbro inclusions are located near Tigerton and Rapakivi-type quartz monzonite occurs near Waupaca. Syenite and the Ninemile Swamp granite occur near Wausau. Between 1.1 and one billion years ago, the Keweenawan Supergroup formed, which now underlies northern Wisconsin, inland and south from the shore of Lake Superior beneath Douglas County, Bayfield County and parts of Burnette and Washburn counties. Gabrro, troctolite, granophyre, anorthosite and ferrogranodiorite comprises the Mellen Intrusive Complex and similar intrusive complexes at Mineral Lake, Round Lake and Clam Lake in a line running southwest from the Montreal River. Mafic volcanic rocks overlie quartzite in the Powder Mill Group and Bessemer, which begin northeast of Hayward, Wisconsin and extend northeast, meeting the string of intrusive complexes. From as far south as Polk County northeast through Burnette, Washburn, Bayfield and much of Douglas counties are the widespread basalt flows of the Chengwatana Volcanic Group in the west and the Portage Lake Volcanics in the east. =Paleozoic (542‚Äì252 million years ago)= Unmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks are found in the rock record from the Cambrian, in the early Paleozoic. The feldspathic quartz sandstone and orthoquartz sandstone of Chequamegon, Devils Island and Orienta formations make up the Bayfield Group which underlies the entire Lake Superior shoreline of the state from Chequamecon Bay to the St. Louis River in the west. Most of the state, in a loop from Waupaca County in the east, south in a narrow belt to the Iowa line and west to Eau Claire, Dunn, Barron and parts of Polk and Burnett counties, the underlying rocks are sandstone with dolomite and shale belonging to the Trempeauleau, Elk Mound and Tunnel City groups. Ordovician are particularly widespread in southern and eastern Wisconsin, from the Mississippi River in the west to Kenosha, Racine and Milwaukee in the east. Along the shore, they reach Marquette and underlie the Door Peninsula. These rocks include the dolomite, sandstone and shale of the Prairie du Chien Group, Ancell Group sandstone, limestone, conglomerate and shale, Sinnipee Group dolomite and limestone as well as the shale and dolomite of the Maquoketa Formation which is overlain by the Neda Formation oolite iron oxides. A narrow band along the Lake Michigan shore from Milwaukee to south of Sheboygan, including Port Washington displays Devonian shale and limestone. Paleozoic rocks in eastern Wisconsin today make up the Niagara Escarpment, a shelf of rock extending from Door County to Horicon Marsh. The cliffs along the escarpment are primarily formed by the early Silurian Mayville Dolostone; the rocks that make up the escarpment were deposited within the Michigan Basin. Continued subsidence of this basin during deposition meant that many of the rock layers in eastern Wisconsin have been tilted towards the east. =Mesozoic (252‚Äì66 million years ago)= Very few rocks from the Mesozoic are preserved in Wisconsin, other than occasional areas of non-marine Cretaceous gravel and clay rich in iron. Select rocks in the Driftless Area have yielded ammonite fossils from the middle Turonian period, when Wisconsin was covered by the Western Interior Seaway. = Cenozoic (66 million years ago‚ÄìPresent) = No rocks from the Paleogene or Neogene period are known from Wisconsin; however, abundant Quaternary deposits can be found as a result of the last Ice Age. The most recent glacial cycle, the Wisconsin Glaciation, began about 31,500 years ago and receded from the state by around 7,000 years ago. During this time the Lake Michigan Lobe and the Green Bay Lobe moved across the state; also present were the Chippewa, Superior, Wisconsin Valley, and Langlade lobes. These glacial lobes carved out deep valleys and deposited sediments up to 600 feet deep. Much of central and southwest Wisconsin were never glaciated, leaving the earlier river-generated topography intact; this area is known as the Driftless Area.

It was built from 1820 to 1950. It is also known as Windmill Hill Group, including Ruins, North Farm, Middle Farm aka Larkin Farm and Windmill Hill, South Farm and Steven's Homestead. The property is owned by Water NSW (State Government). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 June 2014.  History  =Appin= Appin town's name came about, despite that most local settlers came from Irish stock, due to Governor Macquarie's arrival in the colony in 1810. At the time, Government House was in Parramatta and one of Macquarie's first intentions was to travel into the nearby country to discover the best land from which the colony could be provided with food. It was already known that the most productive area for that purpose was the Hawkesbury River country, but these districts had proven precarious because of severe flooding which caused great losses in crops and stock.Percival, 1992, 7. The land Macquarie intended to study lay between the Nepean and Georges Rivers. There had been no identification of the land which ran as far south as the Cataract River and was bounded on the west by the Nepean River and on the east by the Georges River. On completion of his survey, this area reminded him so much of his own (home) district in Scotland that he called it the Airds district. Some time later he named the section south, including Mount Gilead, Appin. One of the earliest buildings in the town, still standing, is the Anglican school, where the first generation of children born in Appin received their education. This was erected about 1815. Macquarie gave many grants of land in order to develop the land. The first was granted to Sydney magistrate and acting commissary-general, William Broughton. There were several other grants of smaller amounts, made on condition that after five years, unless sufficient progress had been made in cropping and stocking, the land would revert to the Crown. The district became a great supplier of wheat, corn and barley, carried to Sydney by wagons pulled by teams of bullocks or horses.Percival, 1992, 8. The northern boundary of the Appin district is the property known as Mount Gilead, which was granted to Reuben Uther. Some years later it was purchased by a Sydney businessman, Thomas Rose, who was credited with building the first dam for water conservation in the colony (here). This was carried out very thoroughly and with great expense. He was generous with the water conserved and allowed his neighbours to water their stock in very dry times. He applied to the Governor for some reimbursement, but was refused. This dam was built in 1824. In 1836 Rose built the huge stone windmill, one of the largest of its kind which gave great service for many years grinding wheat of the surrounding areas. In those early years, in a good season, yields in some areas were as high as 45 bushels to the acre. The windmill is still standing; that is the four storey tower which has long been converted to a water tank; but the top hammer and sails have long-since disappeared.Percival, 1992, 27. On the southern side, Mount Gilead was joined by the Hume (family) properties, Beulan and Meadowvale (formerly Rockwood). These and others such as Fairview, Blossom Lodge, Mount Carlon and the big poultry farm conducted by Ingham enterprises are all on the western side of the Appin Road. Opposite the last property is one known as Kildare, one of the pioneer homes of the Irish Dwyer family. Further west was Lesson's Green, an grant to William Crowe, the northern boundary of which joined a grant to John Dwyer, which in turn joined Macquarie Dale, a second grant of made to William Broughton in 1816, which ran as far (west) as the Nepean River. South of this is the property of Elladale, of granted to Alexander Riley in 1812, the boundary to Macquarie Dale (of which) is Elladale Creek. This was later greatly reduced in size by subdivisions and sales. By about 1840, when purchased by Rev. Sparling, the first incumbent at St. Mark's Anglican Church in Appin, it had shrunk to .Percival, 1992, 9. On its southern boundary, it was joined by Broughton's Lachlan Vale, the first land grant in the area.Percival, 1992, 12. That property in turn joined John Kennedy's original grant, that he named Teston. In later years, different owners added to it, growing the property to over . This acreage on the south side joined the area known as Mount Brittain of 180 acres, a grant to William Sykes. With further grants it became over .Percival, 1992, 10. Further south, Mount Brittain joined a grant to James Jordan, the southern boundary being the Cataract River and here was the place known as Jordan's Crossing, where the road from Mount Keira (now Picton Road) crossed the river. There were a number of small grants on the way back to Appin such as those of John Firth, Edward McGee, John Trotter, Nicholas Bryan and Matthew Pearce () and several others. Laurence D'Arcy was also granted joining Jordan's and named it Spring Valley. Other grantees were James Byrne, and Andrew Byrne who had a grant between what is now Ingham enterprises and John Anderson's property that he named Ousedale, the creek that ran through it still bearing this name. A number of the small grants were brought together by purchase and the well-known property of Windmill Hill came into being, owned by William Larkin. This name was given to it because Larkin built a timber windmill on the highest part of it (about the mid-1840s) and it gave great service for many years. The farm later became the property of the Winton family who ran it as a dairy farm until recent years.Percival, 1992, 10-11. =Windmill Hill= North Farm was granted to Moses and Michael Brennan in 1816. The small size of the grant indicates that the land was suitable for grain production. A notice appears in the Sydney Gazette of January 1822 requesting Moses and Michael Brennan of Appin to supply wheat for the NSW Government stores. Members of the Brennan family owned the property up until 1907, during which time the property was adapted for a variety of agricultural activities. By the 1850s wheat was one of the main agricultural products of the district and a number of mills were constructed in the district. The mill that gave Windmill Hill its name was erected in 1846 by Edward Larkin, a Sussex miller who came to Australia with his wife Jane in 1837. Larkin's mill operated for almost 25 years. The mill's life was ended as a result of the rust virus that had begun to attack the colony's wheat crop east of the dividing range by the 1850s. By the 1870s, the rust virus had all but destroyed wheat production in areas east of the dividing range, where climatic conditions helped the disease to flourish. South Farm is situated within the boundaries of a grant made to Richard Tress in 1819. It is likely that the land was more suited to grazing than grain production, as it was much larger than that granted to the Brennans. He sold 190 acres to his neighbour on the eastern side, Daniel Miller in 1829. In 1831 Tress sold the rest of his land to WR Tress. Tress in turn sold the land to Matthew and Catherine Healey in 1838. In 1842, after the death of Matthew Healey the property was sold to John Bray. The property remained in the Bray family until it was sold to Harry Winton in 1884. The Wintons retained the property with only minor changes for 85 years, adding Larkin's to it in 1903. Harry Winton died in 1921 and the property was left to be run by his sons William and Charles. In 1969 the property was sold to the Windmill Hill Pastoral Company. It is unclear when the property was incorporated into the Metropolitan Catchment Area, although it appears farming ceased in the 1970s. The original land grant was subdivided in the 1990s when the western slope of the site was developed as a water treatment facility. The Stevens Property is situated on of land originally granted to Daniel Millar on 17 August 1819. It appears that the property was initially used mainly for dairying and has followed a similar land-use patter to that of South Farm. In 1829, Millar purchased a further 190 acres from his neighbour R Tress (South Farm/Windmill Hill). This purchase increased the size of Millar's property to the south and made the creek, previously running through Tress's property the new boundary between the two farms. Little else is known about the property as there is no significant documentary evidence pertaining to the site. It seems the site is locally known after the last occupiers of the site, the Stevens around the mid 20th century.  Description  The Windmill Hill Group, including Ruins, consists of early to mid nineteenth century farm buildings, mostly in ruins, with associated cultural plantings and archaeological remains, in a relatively intact rural setting. Three of the clusters of buildings (North, Middle and South farms) run north- south along a ridgeline running parallel to Winton Road on its eastern side. To the east the land slopes down to a small creek and has been cleared to create paddocks for cropping and grazing. At the southern end of the valley formed by the creek there is an area of remnant native bushland and a stone dam. Steven's Homestead is on the up-slope of the small valley on its eastern side. There are a range of building types represented in the group including stone ashlar, stone rubble, timber slab and weatherboard. ;North Farm (Brennan's Farm) North Farm is granted to Moses and Michael Brennan in 1816. The farm buildings consist of two structures: a former sandstone farm building, which is in ruins and a dilapidated timber slab homestead. It sits in an immediate landscape that retains a nineteenth century character of cleared pasture with the view to the east remaining substantially cleared paddocks and bushland as it would have been in the earliest days of European settlement on the property. It also retains a relationship with the other three farms in the group. The timber slab building remains in fair condition and recent works have been undertaken to \\"mothball\\" the structure (including new roof gutters and downpipes). The structure consists of a main cottage and the remains of a former rear kitchen and laundry. The cottage has a mix of weatherboard, timber slab and corrugated iron clad walls. The gabled roof remains and has been over-sheeted with corrugated iron over timber shingles. Only the brick chimneys of the rear kitchen and laundry remain. The granary building to the north of the North Farm house is random-coursed, split faced ashlar sandstone construction with dressed quoins and sills. Walls consist of an inner and outer skin, with rubble infill and some through stones to bind both skins. Only the northern and western walls remain partially standing above head height. The western wall has an unusual V shaped slit halfway up the wall. While this may be a ventilation slit, its position and width has led to local suggestion that it was a fortified structure and the opening is a loophole. There is no evidence of the timber dairy addition, noted in the 2002 CMP (GML). The building is now a ruin. ;Middle Farm (Larkin's Farm) The Middle Farm sits in an immediate landscape that retains a nineteenth century character of cleared pasture with the view to the east over substantially cleared paddocks and bushland as it would have been in the earliest days of European settlement on the property. It also retains a visual relationship with the other three farms in the group. In 1977 the Middle Farm was described as having rendered stone walls and french doors opening to a wooden verandah in the front. The wooden doorways were described as carefully detailed and the house still had its cedar joinery, with mantelpiece and built-in cupboards each side of the fireplace in the living room.Macarthur Development Board 1977: 63 The extant structure consists of the 3-rooms main rooms with lean-to annexe at the rear. Walls are sandstone laid in regular courses with either a picked or split finish, and there is evidence of previous limewash finishes to the interior and exterior walls. The differing finishes to the sandstone walls indicate that the building was constructed as various stages. The gable roof over the main structure remains, and has been over-sheeted with corrugated iron over original/early timber shingles. The skillion roof over the lean-to is similarly treated, however has partially collapsed. There is no evidence remaining of the interior joinery, including fenestration, mantles or floors. The timber battens and lathes (part) of an early lathe and plaster ceiling within the main rooms remain. To the rear of the house there are remnant timber posts, stone, brick and corrugated iron from the now collapsed kitchen. In 1977 it was described as a weatherboard kitchen connected to the house by a covered way, with a stone-flagged courtyard between, fenced with wooden slabs. ;South Farm In 1977 a description of the Windmill Hill area describes a ruin of an early house with stone walled rooms at each end of a collapsed timber central part, to the south of Middle Farm. The area immediately to the north of the dairy at South Farm is heavily overgrown and there are a number of introduced shrubs and small trees adjacent to the large brick cistern. It is likely the stone ruin was located in this area. The former dairy building is a timber framed and corrugated iron clad structure constructed on a concrete base. The majority of the roof and wall cladding remains intact and as such the structure is in a fair condition. Other early elements at the site include a well of masonry construction, remains of a timber post-and-rail fence and remnant orchard plantings to the south-east. ;Stevens Homestead The principal feature of the site is the remains of what appears to have been a sandstone residence now in a ruinous state. The ruin has a rectangular footprint, measuring approx. 15.5m long x 6.7m wide and is constructed of sandstone rubble. The walls are mostly collapsed however would indicate that the residence originally had least six rooms. There is evidence of a plaster finish to the exterior walls, scored to imitate a regular ashlar stone wall. There is evidence of two fireplaces within the stonework. Sandstock brick remnants around the ruin, would indicate that there were other structures at the site. = Condition = As at 17 February 2014, the condition of the property is poor. The Windmill Hill Group, comprising the three farms (North, Middle and South Farms) and Steven's Homestead, has a moderate to high level of integrity. The individual farms composing the Windmill Hill group have the following level of integrity/intactness: *North Farm (Brennan's Farm) - Moderate to high (architectural quality and archaeological potential) *Middle Farm (Larkin's Farm) - Moderate (architectural quality and archaeological potential) *South Farm - Little (architectural quality), Moderate to high (archaeological potential) *Steven's Homestead - Moderate to high (archaeological potential only)  Heritage listing  As at 28 May 2014, the Windmill Hill Group, including Ruins, has state heritage significance for its ability to demonstrate the pattern of middle level farming and settlement in the Cumberland Plain from the 1820s to the early twentieth century, through its cluster of ruined farm buildings, plantings and archaeological remains within a relatively intact rural setting, including remnant native bushland. When viewed from below the western ridgeline, the few visible elements in the landscape create a strong sense of place and retain the historic setting of the group of farm buildings and their relationship to one another which is increasingly rare as the Cumberland Plain is subjected to development pressure. The rural vernacular character of the various buildings and ruins contributes to the high aesthetic quality of the group. This significance is reinforced through the visual connections between each individual farm across the valley. The collection of building ruins and landscape features has a high level of significance as they demonstrate varying construction techniques and vernacular styles from the early to late nineteenth century, which have the ability to provide information on the relative construction periods and also the fortunes of the early settlers that occupied them. Windmill Hill was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 June 2014 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Windmill Hill group has State historical significance as it demonstrates the pattern of middle level farming and settlement in the Cumberland Plain from the 1820s to the early twentieth century. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Windmill Hill Group has State heritage significance at an Aesthetic/Technical level. When viewed from below the western ridgeline, there are few visible modern elements in the landscape, providing a strong sense of place and retaining the historic setting of the group of farm buildings and their relationship to one another. North and Middle farms in particular are distinctive visual elements along the ridgeline. The rural vernacular character of the buildings contributes to the high aesthetic quality of the group, as does the setting with its combination of cleared paddocks and remnant native bushland. Each farm represents an important component of the overall cultural landscape of the area and each farm reinforces the contribution of the other, strengthened by the visual sightlines between them. The collection of building ruins and landscape features also has a high level of technical significance as they demonstrate varying construction techniques and vernacular styles from the early to late nineteenth century. The stone dam, which appears to date from the early to mid nineteenth century, has technical significance, despite its partially collapsed state, as a relatively uncommon example of a substation domestic water supply from this period. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The social significance of the Windmill Hill Group has not been formally assessed through community consultation, but it has no known strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group. It may have significance for the descendants of the first settlers on this property, but this attachment does not meet the thresholds for significance under this particular criterion. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Windmill Hill Group has moderate to high archaeological research potential and therefore state heritage research significance. Each homestead site has the potential to provide information about early settlement within the southern limits of the Cumberland Plain that is not available from other sources. This includes evidence of agricultural practices such as cropping, milling and water management as well as domestic life for the middle class settlers of the area. The construction of the granary (sandstone) at North Farm has particular significance under this criterion for its ability to inform of the importance of storing and securing grain in the early nineteenth century. The combination of construction techniques utilised for the various buildings and ruins has the potential to provide information on the different construction periods for the collection, as well as the relative fortune of the early settlers that occupied these properties. The research potential of the group is increased by the number of possible sites available for investigation within a small geographic area The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Windmill Hill Group has state rarity significance as an unusual surviving group of early to mid-nineteenth century farm building ruins, plantings and archaeological remains in a largely intact rural landscape. When viewed from below the ridgeline the group maintains its historic setting with few modern visual intrusions. This is extremely unusual in the Cumberland Plain. While there are a number of other surviving farms from this period in the Cumberland Plain region, many from grants made by Governor Macquarie, the number of farms within the group is also unusual as many early landscapes of this nature have been subdivided. The relatively intact relationship of the four farms within their landscape setting adds to the rarity of the group as does the fact they are from middle level farming activity. Many of the other surviving early colonial homesteads are larger properties by notable architects or with connections to the landed gentry and are single farm sites. The Pinups radiate at Middle Farm, which appears to be up to 130 years old, is a rare surviving, early example of its kind in NSW. The stone dam may be a particularly early and rare example of a domestic water supply from the early nineteenth century. The ruin of the granary building at North Farm is unusual in that it appears to have a loophole or gun slit in the remaining section of the western wall. Although this can't be proven, if it is evidence of a fortified agricultural building this would be rare in a State context. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The differing construction techniques utilised for the various buildings and ruins are good representative examples of other similar vernacular structures from the early nineteenth century and reflect the \\"make do\\" nature of the early settlers.

It is a Grade I listed building. The parkland in which it stands is Grade II* listed. The house was built between 1736 and 1738 for Charles Talbot, Lord Chancellor to George II, for the use of his son William Talbot, 1st Earl Talbot and the latter's wife Mary de Cardonnel. It was extended in 1870-3 by Edward Rhys Wingfield. The building is constructed in two storeys plus a basement of ashlar with a stone slate roof. It is rectangular in plan with the later extensions at both ends. The frontage has 9 bays of which the central 3 bays project. Several of the parks features (a dovecote and two temples) are separately Grade II* listed. History Before the Dissolution of the Monasteries the manor of Great Barrington had belonged to Llanthony Priory. In 1540 it was sold to John Guise, who in turn sold the estate to Richard Monnington and his son-in-law Reginald Bray in 1553. It then descended for over 200 years within the Bray family until Reginald Morgan Bray sold it in 1735 to the Lord Chancellor, who commissioned the building of the new house before dying shortly afterwards. His son and daughter-in-law (Mary de Cardonnel) moved in but separated in 1742, leaving Mary de Cardonnel in possession of the house. She laid out the pleasure grounds around the house. Mary de Cardonnel's daughter, Cecil de Cardonnel, 2nd Baroness Dynevor, married George Rice, whose descendants adopted the surname of Talbot-Rice and then Rice-Trevor. The house then passed by marriage to the Wingfields who adopted the name of Rhys Wingfield and in whose hands the property still remains.

It was designed by the New South Wales Government Railways Road Motor Section and built in 1937 by Waddingtons Ltd (body), Ford Motor Co. (chassis and mechanical components). It is also known as Rail Bus and Rail Pay Bus FP1. The property is owned by Rail Corporation New South Wales, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 26 September 2003.  History  = Origins = The first group of rail buses, of which FP1 was the first, were built in 1937 to an overall design of the NSW Railways' Road Motor section, by coach- building firm Waddingtons Pty Ltd, Granville (subsequently to become Commonwealth Engineering). Although essentially similar, in being constructed on a truck chassis with Ford mechanicals (V8 petrol engine and gearbox), the bodies of this group, numbered FP1 to FP6, differed somewhat. No's 1 and 6 were single ended, and originally had to be turned (using a locomotive turntable or a triangle junction) at each end of a run. Despite their design similarities, FP1 was different in style from FP6, while both the single-ended buses were different from Nos. 2 to 5, which were substantially identical. As well as having driving controls at both ends, buses Nos. 2 to 5 were slightly larger, and had a door on both sides, originally accommodating 18 passengers. The rail bus concept was intended to provide a passenger service on minor branch lines where the available traffic did not support economic use of a conventional steam-hauled passenger or mixed train, or even a rail-motor service provided by one of the relatively new \\"42 footer\\" CPH \\"tin hare\\" motors. FP1 entered service on 7 July 1937, and apparently operated in the south-west of the state, with some evidence that it suffered a failure at Grenfell on 29 November. The rest of the fleet entered service in September 1937, Nos. 2, 3 and 4 on the 27th. The others may well have entered service on the same date, but this is not recorded. It appears that the rail bus concept was less than successful, because all were withdrawn from passenger service, to be used as pay buses, within a year or two of their commissioning. It is not recorded why they were not successful, but it is likely that the depressed economic circumstances of the time impacted on the number of available passengers, while road transport was by that time emerging as a serious threat to rail, particularly for passenger services - the road bus concept being by then quite well established. Information on when FP1 and its sisters were converted to pay buses is sketchy. FP1 is thought to have been converted in September 1937, so that its career as a passenger vehicle was very brief indeed, but it has also been suggested that the conversion occurred some time after its failure at Grenfell in November, possibly in conjunction with repairs. In any case, it had certainly become a pay bus by 30June1938, as it is noted as such in the Railways Department's Annual Report for 1937-38. It is believed that the other buses of this group entered service variously at Harden and Cowra (still in 1937). Most sources state that they began, as with FP1, as passenger vehicles, but there is also a suggestion that they never entered this service at all, being used as pay buses from the outset. In view of the record in the Annual Report for 1937-38 of only one pay bus, it seems likely that the conversion of Nos. 2 - 6 occurred after June 1938, so that they were all commissioned as passenger buses. = In service = David Cooke's book Rail Motors and XPT's indicates that the Railways' 1938-39 Annual Report records a general overhaul of FP1 in October 1938, carried out mainly to ascertain the degree of wear, as the vehicle had travelled some since it entered service. Apparently the results were pleasing, as cylinder bore wear was negligible. The most significant event involving a pay bus was the infamous Yanderra pay bus incident of 8 December 1941. At approx. 11.40 a.m. Pay Bus FP5 was heading in the down direction south of Yanderra Station on the Main Southern line, when explosives placed under the line by intending thieves were detonated, de-railing and severely damaging the bus. The crew of three were all killed. The culprits, believed to be two men, escaped with some (Pounds)2000 in loose notes and change, but most of the money carried remained in the safe, which was fixed to the bus chassis. The bus was so badly damaged that it was written off (in November 1942). A replacement, again built by Waddingtons, entered service in September 1945 as No. 5 (2nd). This new bus was single-ended, being patterned on No.6. All the surviving pay buses were transferred to the Mechanical Branch in 1942, presumably as part of a reorganisation - possibly the original Road Motor section being absorbed into the Mechanical Branch. All except No. 2 (and of course also excepting No. 5) were transferred on 23 August that year, with No. 2 apparently following on 5 October. FP1 received another general overhaul in June 1943, and again in 1949 after it was submerged by floodwaters at Maitland. = Modifications in service = Apart from the minor changes required to convert them to pay buses, these vehicles received various modifications during their life. Nos.3 and 6 suffered accident damage in 1940 and 1942 respectively, and it is likely that subsequent repairs involved minor modifications. No. 4 was fitted with a canopy or double roof in 1947, while it appears that at least Nos. 1, 5 (2nd) and 6 were similarly fitted at some stage. From photographic evidence, it is certain that at least No. 5 (2nd) was so fitted by 1956 (and of course No.1, which still has this feature). Nos. 4 and 6 are recorded as having chassis fractures repaired in the 1960s, and this may have entailed some degree of modification - e.g. strengthening. It has been stated that the engines originally fitted were of the Ford Mercury type. However this is unlikely since this model was not introduced until 1939. In all probability the original engines were the 1937 Model 78, with 21-stud cylinder heads. These were to the basic side-valve V8 design introduced by Ford in 1932.* All the buses were originally fitted with a pair of headlights at waist level at each end, together with circular marker lights, but by c. 1950, and probably earlier, these had been removed and replaced with a single roof-mounted headlight at each end, and these remained throughout their life. For a brief period, some buses, including FP1, had both the twin lights and the roof mounted light at the same time, as a transitional arrangement. At around the same time, new marker lights with twin lenses were provided. It appears that the single-ended buses did not receive their headlight at the rear until they were modified for reverse running. Although no external horns were fitted originally, photographic evidence suggests that all the buses had twin air horns fitted on the roof from -40. Again from photographs and comparison with FP1 in its present configuration, it is evident that the radiator grille was changed at some stage. Some time after conversion to pay buses, the single- ended buses were modified to allow reverse running. This entailed body modifications (retractable air scoops) to provide engine cooling, and mechanical changes including to the transmission (addition of a supplementary reversing gearbox). The driving position (and location of the instruments) was also altered. All sources are silent on when this modification was made, but it seems likely that it happened fairly early in their life, as turning such a small vehicle using a steam locomotive turntable must surely have seemed like overkill. During the 1950s, some of the buses were fitted with visors above the windscreens to reduce glare when travelling into the sun, but it is not clear which units had this modification. It is uncertain whether No.1 was one of the buses which received this addition; there are no photos showing it, there is no evidence of such a fitting, and it is not fitted now. Relatively late in their lives, several of the rail buses were apparently fitted with English Ford Thames engines, probably because the US version was no longer available, having been displaced by an overhead valve design in the early 1950s. FP1 received its new engine in December 1964, FP3 in August 1969, and FP6 in January 1962. The Thames engine was of the same basic Ford side-valve pre-war design, but reverted to 21-stud cylinder heads, the same as the original 1937 version. The engine currently fitted to Pay Bus FP1 is of this type. = Livery = All the original rail buses were painted green and cream, but the livery design varied. The photo on Page 2 shows the original livery for FP1, with sweeping curves in cream over the wheel spats and a cream flash under the windows, in what would now be called art-deco style. The double- ended buses were originally painted in a much simpler style, with cream down to the waist-line, sweeping down at the ends to the bottom of the grille. Later, -40, the double-ended buses were painted in a simplified scheme, green, with cream down to the waist without the flaring down at the ends. This change seems to have occurred at about the same time as the roof-mounted headlights and horns were fitted. This is shown in the photo of No. 2 on Page 8. Another green and yellow scheme was used at least on FP1, and photos exist of it in a darker green all over, with cream or yellow window and windscreen surrounds. It has been suggested that at some stage in the 1940s, FP1 at least was painted in yet another green/yellow scheme, being overall dark green, with yellow lining above and below the windows. This scheme is similar to that shown in the cover photo, applied when restored by the Rail Transport Museum . The final in-service livery carried by these buses was an all-over Indian Red scheme with Chrome Yellow lining, thought to have first been applied in the mid 1950s, when Indian Red livery became the NSWGR standard for the new main- line diesel-electric locomotives then being introduced, the 42 Class (1955). This scheme is shown in the photo of No. 6 below. (Note: Indian Red is sometimes called Tuscan Red, but the two were different.) = Themes = Rail Pay Bus FP1 and its sisters obviously fit into the state historical theme of transport. It could also be argued that these buses made a contribution to technological development, as an early attempt to apply road bus technology to rail transport. The first such attempt was Rail Motor No. 1, which in 1919 involved the conversion of a road truck chassis and drive-train for passenger transport by rail, with a classic timber carriage body based on railway practice. However the FP series rail buses were much more strongly based on road buses, both in technology and appearance. Through their role in paying remote Railway personnel, the Pay Buses were also part of an important social institution in rural communities around the state, where the Railways were such an important (and paternalistic) employer and a vital element of country life in particular. = Scrapping = All members of this first group of rail buses, except of course No. 5 (1st), were withdrawn from service between 1968 and 1970. FP1 was withdrawn on 3 October 1968. All except FP1 were scrapped in December 1970. Pay Bus FP1 was designated for preservation and placed in the care of the NSW Rail Transport Museum on 27 March 1969. Withdrawal and subsequent scrapping of the original group was enabled by the commissioning of a new group of six pay buses (plus, remarkably enough, one 18-seat passenger bus of the same basic configuration) in 1968. Designated FP7 to 13, this group were built by Commonwealth Engineering Pty Ltd, Granville - the successor to Waddingtons. Although now withdrawn from service and sold, following the introduction of more modern methods of paying staff, several of the later group still exist in preservation, including the RTM's Nos. 7, 10 & 12. = Rail Pay Bus FP 1 = The Rail Transport Museum having taken custody of it in 1969, FP1 was first moved, under its own power, to the RTM's initial site at Petersham. Then when space was made available for the Museum at Enfield Locomotive Depot, FP1 was moved there, again under its own power. While it was at Enfield, Rail Transport Museum personnel cosmetically restored it by repairing body rust and minor panel damage and re-painting it in the livery seen in the cover photo. FP1 was placed on display when the Museum opened to the public on 22 October 1972. In 1975 the pay bus was moved to the new Museum site at Thirlmere along with other exhibits, and initially placed on display on a short section of track under a car-port roof. It is said that it may have once ventured onto and run on the Loop Line (now the Thirlmere Heritage Railway). It has not been worked on since, nor has it been on display since it was superficially damaged in a shunting accident .CMP 2002  Description  Because of it was designed by the Road Motor Section of the Railways and built by one of Sydney's leading bus body builders of the time, this vehicle demonstrates a considerable number of bus features. This was no doubt a deliberate ploy to emphasise the \\"bus\\" concept as opposed to a standard rail vehicle. Its design is typical of the art deco period with rounded body panels and flowing curves favoured by the motor vehicle designers of the time. The style was accentuated by the paint scheme adopted, again similar to road bus styling. In contrast to four other vehicles which entered service at the same time, this vehicle was single ended (i.e. had only one set of driving controls) and had to be turned at the end of each trip. The other four had driving controls at each end. Seating for passengers was provided in standard bus type seats. As a pay bus the vehicle was fitted with a safe for the wages, tables and chairs for the paymaster, a passengers' seat on the left side of the engine cowling, and the drivers seat about one third of the way along the car. = Condition = As at 5 June 2003, for a museum exhibit, this vehicle is in extremely poor physical condition. The body shows signs of neglect with panel damage and rust evident. The interior appears never to have had any remedial work carried out. The old linoleum on the floor and the paymaster's table has deteriorated to a stage where it needs to be replaced. The seats are in poor condition, being torn with stuffing hanging out. Parts of the floor have been removed, possibly for repair, but no evidence of any repair is to be seen. Interior panelling is coming adrift and the light fittings have been removed or taken off the vehicle. The front windscreens have been removed and covered with a hessian type material which allows water to leak into the car. At the front left hand side rust is starting to appear on the dashboard. = Archaeological potential is high = The integrity of this vehicle is high provided it is recovered and correctly restored for display in a suitable museum. = Modifications and dates = The following modifications have been made to the railbus: *1937 Entered service as 17 seat rail bus *1938 Converted to rail pay bus *1942 Ownership assumed by Mechanical Branch in lieu of Road Motor Section *1949 Caught in Maitland Floods and completely submerged *1964 Ford Thames V8 petrol engine replaced the original Ford V8 Mercury petrol engine *1968 Declared surplus by Railway Department *1969 Handed over to Rail Transport Museum at Thirlmere  Heritage listing  As at 29 July 2005, Pay Bus FP 1 is of state significance because it demonstrates the application of the emerging road bus concept to rail transport, in attempting to provide a passenger service on branch lines where more conventional rail transport was uneconomic. When this use was short-lived, FP 1 and its sisters of the first group of rail buses were successfully adapted for service in paying wages all over the state, initiating a system which remained in use for 50 years, and demonstrating considerable social significance in the context of the large number of Railways personnel stationed at remote locations. As well as its social significance, Pay Bus FP 1 is significant historically, aesthetically and technically in the creative adaptation to rail use of road vehicle styling, coach-building and technology. Rail Paybus FP1 was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 26 September 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. As the leader of the first group of rail buses, FP1 is historically significant because it demonstrates the application of the emerging road bus concept to rail transport, to provide a passenger service on branch lines where the level of patronage did not justify a conventional passenger or mixed train, or a rail motor. When this experiment proved to be less than successful, the adaptation of these units for service as a pay bus, a use which continued for 50 years until overtaken by more modern methods of paying wages to remotely stationed personnel, is also highly significant historically. In this context, FP1 is very much representative, while as the only survivor of the original group, it is also extremely rare. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. FP1 and its sisters display aesthetic and creative significance in the adaptation of the coach-building techniques and appearance of contemporary road buses to rail transport. Although the various members of the class differed slightly in appearance, their design origin was unmistakably rooted in the road bus of the 1930s. FP1 probably displays this characteristic more than any of the others. Certainly they looked nothing like other railway vehicles. Early paint schemes emphasised the road bus origins, with attractive two-tone livery, initially using swooping curves very much in the manner of the period and now generally seen as typical of the art deco style. Road buses even up to the 1950s and 1960s were frequently painted in similar style. Again, FP1 is both representative and rare. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The first rail buses also have obvious social significance, in the first instance because of their importance in attempting to provide a passenger service where more conventional rail transport was uneconomic. However given that this use was short-lived, the reallocation of these vehicles as pay buses, allowing substantial and enduring changes and efficiencies in the way Railway staff were paid, is the more significant. The Railways were an important element of life in most parts of rural NSW, with Railway employees and their families representing a significant proportion of the community - indeed the NSW Government Railways were the largest employer in Australia. The periodic arrival of the pay bus at a town where Railway staff were employed was also a significant social event. In this context, and especially as this same method of payment of wages to remote staff continued through a further generation of pay bus, spanning a total period of some 50years, FP1 can be said to be representative. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. There is considerable significance in the adaptation of road bus technology to rail transport, displayed by this first group of rail buses in particular. Both mechanically and as examples of coach-building, these vehicles are pure road bus, with the necessary adaptation to fit them for rail use confined to the mechanical aspects only - virtually only the wheels. Again under this heading, FP1 is both representative and rare. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Extremely rare. This is the only known example of a pre-war rail bus in existence. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. This is the only StateRail owned rail bus/pay bus extant. It is a good representation of adaptive use of other technologies applied to a railway situation and a re-use of a vehicle that was not satisfactory in its original role, but was successful in another.

The extended play was released on 30 October 2015. The three-year gap between the EP and the previous release Welcome is, to date, the longest gap between two releases by the band. The four track EP has been described as a departure of the band's original post-punk sound and an embracement of a more pub rock and punk-oriented sound. The orchestration of the band's first two albums, Brutalism and Joy as an Act of Resistance have been linked to the sound of Meat.  Background  In September 2014, the first track off the EP, \\"The Idles Chant\\", was premiered on BBC's Introducing the West session series. The track has been described as a departure from the band's original post-punk roots and contains a more pub rock and punk rock tone. The first single off the EP, Queens was released a year prior to the EP release. The music video features a naked man wearing a wrestling mask while eating a bowl of hard boiled eggs. The staff of Crack described the music video as \\"confusing and disturbing\\". Laurence Day of The Line of Best Fit found the video to be entertaining and the track to be a more punk-oriented track compared to their work on Welcome. In a retrospective review, The Fat Angel Sings described the track as a cornerstone for Idles as a \\"brutal entity\\". After touring in Spring 2015, the band re-recorded the tracks for their EP, which was announced on 2 October 2015. In describing the EP and its name, lead singer Joe Talbot said \\"we are lumps of imperfect meat\\". In describing the album in contrast to Welcome, Talbot said in an interview with The Line of Best Fit that the members of IDLES are \\"better friends. Our music is more accomplished; in that we're more succinct with our message and sound, plus Bowen's not around to fuck around with pedals as he lives in London now.

Critics in retrospective reviews of the EP felt the album was too cautious and sounded too much like other post-punk revival bands rather than their own identity. Of the time of recording and of the EP, Joe Talbot said that \\"it took us a long time to get productive because we didn‚Äôt know what the fuck we were doing at all, we were fucking terrible for a long time.\\" Nevertheless, the album has been credited as an album that broke Idles into relevancy and fostered fans, although fans have been critical of the album.

In (numerical) computational mathematics, such as numerical algebraic geometry, candidate solutions are computed algorithmically, but there is the possibility that errors have corrupted the candidates. For instance, in addition to the inexactness of input data and candidate solutions, numerical errors or errors in the discretization of the problem may result in corrupted candidate solutions. The goal of numerical certification is to provide a certificate which proves which of these candidates are, indeed, approximate solutions. Methods for certification can be divided into two flavors: a priori certification and a posteriori certification. A posteriori certification confirms the correctness of the final answers (regardless of how they are generated), while a priori certification confirms the correctness of each step of a specific computation. A typical example of a posteriori certification is Smale's alpha theory, while a typical example of a priori certification is interval arithmetic.  Certificates  A certificate for a root is a computational proof of the correctness of a candidate solution. For instance, a certificate may consist of an approximate solution x, a region R containing x, and a proof that R contains exactly one solution to the system of equations. In this context, an a priori numerical certificate is a certificate in the sense of correctness in computer science. On the other hand, an a posteriori numerical certificate operates only on solutions, regardless of how they are computed. Hence, a posteriori certification is different from algorithmic correctness ‚Äì for an extreme example, an algorithm could randomly generate candidates and attempt to certify them as approximate roots using a posteriori certification.  A posteriori certification methods  There are a variety of methods for a posteriori certification, including = Alpha theory = The cornerstone of Smale's alpha theory is bounding the error for Newton's method. Smale's 1986 work introduced the quantity \\\\alpha, which quantifies the convergence of Newton's method. More precisely, let F be a system of analytic functions in the variables x, D the derivative operator, and N the Newton operator. The quantities \\\\beta(f,x) = \\\\x - N(x)\\\\ = \\\\Df(x)^{-1} f(x)\\\\ \\\\gamma(f,x) = \\\\sup_{k\\\\geq 2}\\\\left\\\\ \\\\frac{Df(x)^{-1}D^kf(x)}{k!} \\\\right\\\\^\\\\frac{1}{k-1} and \\\\alpha(f,x) = \\\\beta(f,x) \\\\gamma(f,x) are used to certify a candidate solution. In particular, if \\\\alpha(f,x) < \\\\frac{13 - 3\\\\sqrt{17}}{4}, then x is an approximate solution for f, i.e., the candidate is in the domain of quadratic convergence for Newton's method. In other words, if this inequality holds, then there is a root x^\\\\ast of F so that iterates of the Newton operator converge as \\\\left\\\\N^k(x)-x^\\\\ast\\\\right\\\\\\\\leq\\\\frac{1}{2^{2^k-1}}\\\\x-x^\\\\ast\\\\. The software package alphaCertified provides an implementation of the alpha test for polynomials by estimating \\\\beta and \\\\gamma. = Interval Newton and Krawczyck methods = Suppose G:\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{R}^n is a function whose fixed points correspond to the roots of F. For example, the Newton operator has this property. Suppose that I is a region, then, # If G maps I into itself, i.e., G(I)\\\\subseteq I, then by Brouwer fixed-point theorem, G has at least one fixed point in I, and, hence F has at least one root in I. # If G is contractive in a region containing I, then there is at most one root in I. There are versions of the following methods over the complex numbers, but both the interval arithmetic and conditions must be adjusted to reflect this case. Interval Newton method In the univariate case, Newton's method can be directly generalized to certify a root over an interval. For an interval J, let m(J) be the midpoint of J. Then, the interval Newton operator applied to J is :IN(J)=m(J)-F(m(J))/F'(J). In practice, any interval containing F'(J) can be used in this computation. If x is a root of F, then by the mean value theorem, there is some c\\\\in J such that F(m(J))-F'(c)(m(J)-x)=F(x)=0. In other words, F(m(J))=F'(c)(m(J)-x). Since F'(J) contains the inverse of F at all points of J, it follows that m(J)-x\\\\in F(m(J))/F'(J). Therefore, x=m(J)-(m(J)-x)\\\\in IN(J). Furthermore, if 0 ot\\\\in F'(J), then either m(J) is a root of F and IN(J)=\\\\\\\\{m(J)\\\\\\\\} or m(J) ot\\\\in IN(J). Therefore, J\\\\cap N(J) is at most half the width of J. Therefore, if there is some root of F in J, the iterative procedure of replacing J by J\\\\cap IN(J) will converge to this root. If, on the other hand, there is no root of F in J, this iterative procedure will eventually produce an empty interval, a witness to the nonexistence of roots. See interval Newton method for higher dimensional analogues of this approach. Krawczyck method Let Y be any n\\\\times n invertible matrix in GL(n,\\\\mathbb{R}). Typically, one takes Y to be an approximation to F'(y)^{-1}. Then, define the function G(x)=x-YF(x). We observe that x is a fixed of G if and only if x is a root of F. Therefore the approach above can be used to identify roots of F. This approach is similar to a multivariate version of Newton's method, replacing the derivative with the fixed matrix Y. We observe that if J is a compact and convex region and y\\\\in J, then, for any x\\\\in J, there exist c_1,\\\\dots,c_n\\\\in J such that :G(y)-G(x)=\\\\begin{bmatrix} abla g_1(c_1)^T\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ abla g_n(c_n)^T\\\\end{bmatrix}(y-x). Let G'(J) be the Jacobian matrix of G evaluated on J. In other words, the entry (G'(J))_{ij} consists of the image of \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_i}{\\\\partial x_j} over J. It then follows that G(x)\\\\in G(y)+ abla G(J)(x-y), where the matrix-vector product is computed using interval arithmetic. Then, allowing x to vary in J, it follows that the image of G on J satisfies the following containment: G(J)\\\\subset G(y)+G'(J)(J-y), where the calculations are, once again, computed using interval arithmetic. Combining this with the formula for G, the result is the Krawczyck operator :K_{y,Y}(J)=y-YF(y)+(I-F'(J))(J-y), where I is the identity matrix. If K_{y,Y}(J)\\\\subset J, then G has a fixed point in J, i.e., F has a root in J. On the other hand, if the maximum matrix norm using the supremum norm for vectors of all matrices in I-F'(J) is less than 1, then G is contractive within J, so G has a unique fixed point. A simpler test, when J is an axis- aligned parallelepiped, uses y=m(J), i.e., the midpoint of J. In this case, there is a unique root of F if :\\\\K(X)-m(X)\\\\<\\\\frac{w(X)}{2}, where w(X) is the length of the longest side of J. = Miranda test = * Miranda test (Yap, Vegter, Sharma)  A priori certification methods  * Interval arithmetic (Moore, Arb, Mezzarobba) * Condition numbers (Beltran‚ÄìLeykin) = Interval arithmetic = Interval arithmetic can be used to provide an a priori numerical certificate by computing intervals containing unique solutions. By using intervals instead of plain numeric types during path tracking, resulting candidates are represented by intervals. The candidate solution-interval is itself the certificate, in the sense that the solution is guaranteed to be inside the interval. = Condition numbers = Numerical algebraic geometry solves polynomial systems using homotopy continuation and path tracking methods. By monitoring the condition number for a tracked homotopy at every step, and ensuring that no two solution paths ever intersect, one can compute a numerical certificate along with a solution. This scheme is called a priori path tracking. Non-certified numerical path tracking relies on heuristic methods for controlling time step size and precision. In contrast, a priori certified path tracking goes beyond heuristics to provide step size control that guarantees that for every step along the path, the current point is within the domain of quadratic convergence for the current path.

Algebraic geometry  Nonlinear algebra is closely related to algebraic geometry, where the main objects of study include algebraic equations, algebraic varieties, and schemes.  Computational nonlinear algebra  Current methods in computational nonlinear algebra can be broadly broken into two domains: symbolic and numerical.

It has been performed mainly at casinos in the Las Vegas area. Jason Tenner produces and stars in the show. History The act originated out of The Mothership Connection, a 1970s funk tribute band in which Tenner played in the mid-1990s. Tenner was inspired to begin incorporating Prince's music into the band's act after he dressed as the musician for Halloween in 1996 and received positive feedback on the resemblance. He and other members of The Mothership Connection formed Purple Reign as a band in 1997. It was named after Prince's 1984 hit song, \\"Purple Rain\\", and the film of the same name. The group performed regularly at Tom and Jerry's, a bar near the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus. In 2001, the band was hired to perform nightly in the lounge at the Boardwalk Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. They soon added impersonators of Prince associates Morris Day and Jerome Benton to the lineup. The band remained at the Boardwalk until the hotel closed in 2006. For the next few years, the band performed weekly gigs at various casinos, including Santa Fe Station, Mandalay Bay, and the Monte Carlo. They made an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman in 2008. In 2009, Purple Reign made its transition to being a ticketed show, rather than a band playing in open casino lounges; it was signed as a weekend headliner act at the Hooters Casino Hotel. The show moved to The D casino in Downtown Las Vegas in 2012. When the D's showroom closed for renovations eight months later, the show moved back to Hooters and then had a short run at the Planet Hollywood casino, before returning to the D in June 2014. Tenner moved his show to the Shimmer Cabaret at the Westgate Las Vegas in October 2014. After Prince's death in April 2016, the show gained extra attention, and moved into the hotel's main theater, where a more elaborate stage production was developed. A tribute to Vanity 6, a female vocal group assembled by Prince, was added to the show. Tenner found that the larger venue was too expensive to make the show profitable, however, so he left in October 2017. Purple Reign reopened at the Tropicana Las Vegas the following month.

These rocks experienced numerous deformations during mountain building events and much of the region was flooded by shallow seas depositing thick sequences of sedimentary rock during the Paleozoic. Fewer rocks have deposited since the Mesozoic as several kilometers of rock have eroded into the continental shelf and Atlantic coastal plain, although volcanic and sedimentary rocks in the Newark Basin are a prominent fossil-bearing feature near New York City from the Mesozoic rifting of the supercontinent Pangea. Stratigraphy, Tectonics & Geologic History The igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock of New York formed in the Precambrian and are coterminous with the Canadian Shield. The Adirondack Mountains, Thousand Islands, Hudson Highlands, and Fordham gneiss, along with outcrops in the Berkshires just over the state line in Massachusetts, are part of the Grenville Province, a large piece of continental crust which accreted to the Canadian Shield and underlies much of Quebec, Ontario as far west as Lake Huron and as far east as Labrador. These rocks date to 1.3 to 1.1 billion years ago in the Proterozoic and formed from lime mud, sand and clay on coastal barrier islands as well as evaporites in intervening lagoons. The Avalonian mountain building event 575 million years ago in the Neoproterozoic is poorly understood but deformed and metamorphosed the Hudson Highlands and Manhattan Prong. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= New York constituted a continental margin in the Paleozoic as multi-cellular life became common. As the proto-Atlantic Ocean opened, a marine transgression in the Cambrian and Ordovician flooded much of the region, with the Potsdam Sea transgressing westward. A reversal in mantle convection currents around 445 million years ago, in the Middle Ordovician, launched the Taconic orogeny and closed the Iapetus Ocean. Crustal shortening caused a large section of continental crust in the west to thrust beneath the crust to the east, resulting in partial melting and the creation of an island arc. This complex tectonic situation produced intense folding, fracturing, thrust faults and large landslides which are now preserved in the Taconic Mountains. It also led to the intrusion of the Cortlandt and Croton Falls igneous complexes, in the vicinity of Peekskill. The current day Taconic Mountains are the stubs of towering ancient mountains, as evidenced by high-pressure metamorphism indicating that extant rocks were buried under miles of overburden, which subsequently eroded. The sedimentation pattern changed from gradual deposition toward the east to much more rapid sedimentation to the west, filling in the Queenston Delta from the late Ordovician onward into a shallow sea. At the end of the Taconic orogeny, an unconformity appears with the uplift and erosion of the massive delta. In the Silurian and Devonian, new sediments covered the erosional surface, beginning with the white quartz pebbles of the Shawangunk conglomerate. Crustal stretching created a series horst and graben features, which remain in the Adirondacks as well as in the Mohawk, Hudson and Champlain areas. Down-dropped grabens preserved Ordovician rock from erosion. Between 375 and 335 million years ago, the proto-Atlantic Ocean closed, forming the supercontinent Pangaea. The Acadian orogeny formed a massive range, much taller than the heavily eroded Taconics further to the east. Rocks in what is now eastern New York as far west as the Adirondacks was \\"overprinted\\" with new mineral assemblages forming due to deformation that had begun in the Taconic orogeny. The newly formed mountains rapidly eroded and shed sediments, even as uplift continued. A massive apron of sediment formed the Catskill Delta to the westward, burying much of the Taconics and filling in a shallow sea. The Catskill Mountains formed through erosion of the debris field from the Acadian mountains. The Peekskill granite intruded after the orogeny, in Westchester County, between 335 and 320 million years ago. Around 250 million years ago, the final Appalachian mountain orogeny, the Alleghanian orogeny occurred. Geologists debate whether gentle east-west folds in the Alleghany Plateau are remnants of this orogeny. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= The Newark Lowlands of the Newark Basin extends into New York between the Hudson Highlands and the Manhattan Prong. The basin formed beginning 220 million years ago during the late Triassic as Pangea rifted apart. Failed rift basins like the Newark Basin filled with thick sequences of sediment. The Stockton Formation is the lowest unit, with feldspar rich sandstone and conglomerate alternating with layers of shale mudstone. A rift valley lake deposited the mudstone and black shale of the middle unit‚Äîthe Lockatong Formation‚Äîwhich holds extremely well preserved fossilized freshwater fish. This is, in turn, is overlain by the red-brown shale mudstone and sandstone of the Brunswick Formation which merges with the Hammer Creek Conglomerate. Because rifting thinned the crust, magma upwelled and intruded the basin, producing the feldspar and pyroxene dominant diabase of the Palisades Sill and an almost pure layer olivine up to six meters thick. The sill intruded 195 million years ago in the Early Jurassic. Cooling of the melt led to columnar fracture giving its column-like appearance. Fractional crystallization of what may have been the same magma also left behind the Ladentown Basalt. Lakeshore mud preserved the footprints of a predatory coelophysis in New York along with fossilized fish, clams and arthropods. Offshore of New York is the Fall Zone Peneplain, an area of much more ancient crystalline rocks that forms the slowly sinking continental shelf of eastern North America. Eroded nearly flat, this surface began to be covered by the current sediments of the Atlantic coastal plain beginning in the Jurassic. In fact, the current basement rocks date to a time span between the Proterozoic and early Jurassic. Recent geologic research has revealed the Baltimore Canyon Trough, a long basin south of Long Island filled with up to 12 kilometers of rock. Sedimentary rocks are about six kilometers thick in the Long Island Platform. Some of the thinnest sediments are only 600 meters thick at Fire Island. A research well, COST B-3 drilled 130 kilometers off of Long Island in the Baltimore Canyon Trough, encountering two-kilometer thick rocks from the Cretaceous. Most rocks offshore are marl with some clay and limestone. The green mineral glauconite is particularly common. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= Aside from sediments produced or moved by glaciers, rivers and streams during the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary, Cenozoic rocks are extremely rare in New York. A small Oligocene lignite deposit near Brandon, Vermont may extend into New York. Several kilometers of rock eroded and deposited offshore in the Atlantic coastal plain and eastern North American continental shelf. Drilling offshore of New Jersey and Long Island indicates Cenozoic sediments 130 meters thick reaching up to 1.5 kilometers thick near the edge of the continental shelf. The biggest increase in thickness took place during the Miocene. Deeply weathered saprolite soils formed throughout the region, with small remnants found in New York City, the Adirondacks, and Catskills during highway construction. Rivers responsible for transporting sediment out of the region were significantly rechanneled or filled with sediments during the Pleistocene glaciations. The Erian River once downcut Middle Devonian shales, feeding into the Erie Basin while the Ontarian River eroded Ordovician shales into the Ontario Basin. The Sound River has been inferred as an eastward flowing river replaced by Long Island Sound.

Her best known work is the 1885 book Indigenous flowers of the Hawaiian islands, the first book published with colour images of Hawaiian flowering plants. Biography Sinclair was born Isabella McHutcheson in 1840 near Stirling, Scotland. She is believed to be a daughter of Isabella (Phelps) McHutcheson and her husband William McHutcheson, who was a brother of Elizabeth McHutcheson Sinclair. She emigrated to New Zealand with her family as a young child. On 7 August 1866, Isabella McHutcheson of Blenheim, Marlborough, New Zealand married her cousin, Francis Sinclair, Jr. After marriage to her husband Francis, Sinclair moved with his family to Hawai'i. Her aunt and mother-in-law, Elizabeth Sinclair, was a farmer and plantation owner in New Zealand and Hawaii, best known as the matriarch of the Sinclair family that bought the Hawaiian island of Ni ªihau in 1864 from King Kamehameha V for the sum of $10,000 in gold.  Works  It was in Hawaii that she produced her most notable work Indigenous flowers of the Hawaiian islands. This was the first book published with colour images of Hawaiian flowering plants. After her marriage, Sinclair lived with her husband in Kiekie on the island of Nii'hau and later in Makaweli on the island of Kauai. She explored Niihau, Waimea Valley, Olokele Valley, Kokee and other locations, painting the native flora there and researching information about those species from Native Hawaiians. She collected specimens of each native flowering plant and illustrated each one, creating a portfolio of 44 full-page color plates. She sent the specimens to Joseph Dalton Hooker, renowned botanist and then director of the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, England, for scientific identification. Dr. Hooker provided her with each flower's botanical name, which she documented along with the Hawaiian names, natural habitats and blossoming seasons of each species. In 1885, with the encouragement of Hooker, Sinclair published Indigenous Flowers of the Hawaiian Islands. She dedicated the volume: ‚ÄúTo the Hawaiian Chiefs and People who have been most appreciative friends, and most lenient critics, this work is affectionately inscribed.‚Äù Isabella was among the first authors to express concern about the loss of native habitats on Hawaiian flora due to land development and competition from invasive species: \\"The Hawaiian flora seems to grow in an easy, careless way,\\" she wrote, \\"which, though pleasingly artistic, and well adapted to what may be termed the natural state of the islands, will not long survive the invasions of foreign plants and changed conditions. Forest fires, animals and agriculture, have so changed the islands, within the last fifty or sixty years, that one can now travel for miles . . . without finding a single indigenous plant; the ground being wholly taken possession of by weeds, shrubs and grasses, imported from various countries. . . .\\" .

Isabella's brother, also named William McHutcheson, likely visited his sister during an extensive six-months tour in 1886 that included Hawaii, North America, England, and Scotland. He described his travels in The New Zealander Abroad (1888). He also wrote a serialized account of colonial life, \\"The New Zealander at Home\\" (1890), and published Camp-life in Fiordland, New Zealand (1892). At some point, Isabella and her husband went to California. Isabella died in San Jose, California on 29 December 1890 and was buried at Trinity Church on 31 December 1890. Her name has been transcribed from their records as \\"Sinclaire (Mrs.) Frances\\" In 1902, Francis Sinclair returned to New Zealand and married Isabella's widowed sister, Williamina Shirriffs. He had no issue from either marriage. Francis spent much of the rest of his life in England, published several books of poetry and essays, and died on 22 July 1916 on the Island of Jersey.

The band was formed by members of the now defunct indie rock band Y-O-U after an ironic performance of cheesy soft rock hits at a local club gig took off into a weekly residence. Performing primarily covers, the band‚Äôs set list is centered around a genre called ‚ÄúYacht Rock‚Äù, coined by the early 2000s web series of the same name, consisting primarily of soft rock from the 1970s and 1980s, but at times including songs as recent as the early 1990s. Although the Yacht Rock Revue started as a side project, it is now the main focus for all seven band members: Peter Olson, Nicholas Niespodziani, Mark Cobb, Greg Lee, Mark Bencuya, Mark Dannells, and David Freeman. The band has a contract with Live Nation and tours nationally, playing more than 100 shows a year and selling out theaters in Los Angeles, Boston, Atlanta, and Washington DC. In order to keep up with demand, a subsidiary band was launched in 2009 called Yacht Rock Schooner. In 2015, 2 of the founding band members, Peter Olson & Nicholas Niespodziani, opened Venkman‚Äôs, a restaurant and music venue in Atlanta‚Äôs Old 4th Ward neighborhood.

He showed modest ability in his early career and won only one minor race in his first two seasons. In 1998 however he made rapid progress as he took a minor event at Haydock Park before winning the Chester Stakes and then recording his biggest success in the Group 1 Prix du Cadran. In the following year he failed to win but arguably reached his peak with a second place in a very strong renewal of the Ascot Gold Cup and also finished placed in the Chester Cup and Prix Kergorlay. After being sidelined by injury for almost two years he returned to the track as a seven- year-old in 2001 to win another minor race at Haydock before running second in the Jockey Club Cup. The highlight of his final active season was a second place in the Henry II Stakes. Background Invermark was a dark bay or brown horse bred in England owned and bred by Sir David Wills. A member of the Wills family of tobacco merchants Sir David established the Ditchley Foundation and was described as \\"one of the greatest but least-known benefactors of the post- war era\\". Invermark was trained throughout his racing career by James Fanshawe at the Pegasus Stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Wills was an enthusiastic follower of field sports and Invermark was named after Invermark Lodge in Angus, Scotland. He was sired by Machiavellian, an American-bred, French- trained racehorse who was one of the leading European two-year-olds of his generation, winning the Prix Morny and the Prix de la Salamandre in 1989. He later became a very successful breeding stallion, siring leading winners including Almutawakel, Street Cry, Medicean and Storming Home. Invermark's dam Applecross showed good form in a brief racing career, winning three of her six races and finishing second in both the Park Hill Stakes and the Princess Royal Stakes. She produced several other winners including Craigsteel (Princess of Wales's Stakes) and Inchrory (Stockholm Cup International). She was descended from Alassio, a half-sister to both Royal Charger and the influential broodmare Tessa Gillian. Racing career =Early career= Invermark began his racing career by finishing eighth in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 17 August 1996. He showed some progress in two similar events before the end of the year, running fifth at Thirsk in September and third at Yarmouth in October. The colt began his second campaign by coming home twelfth in a minor handicap race at Newmarket Racecourse in May and was gelded shortly afterwards. After recovering from the operation Invermark returned in a maiden over eleven and a half furlongs at Yarmouth on 22 July and started at odds of 8/1 in an eight-runner field. Ridden by Michael Hills he recorded his first success as he took the lead three furlongs out and prevailed in a tight finish by a head from the Henry Cecil-trained favourite Awesome Wells. He then returned to handicap races, finishing fifth at Newmarket in August and second at Haydock Park in September. On his final run of the year he came home fourth behind Sabadilla in the November Handicap at Doncaster. =1998: four-year-old season= On his first two appearances of 1998 Invermark came home sixth in handicaps at Newmarket and Sandown Park in April. He produced a better effort when finishing runner-up at Doncaster in June and then started odds-on favourite when carrying 140 pounds in a minor handicap over fourteen furlongs at Haydock on 3 July. Ridden by Walter Swinburn he took the lead in the last quarter mile and drew right away from his opponents to win by seven lengths. Richard Hughes took the ride when the gelding contested a more prestigious handicap, the Listed Chester Stakes over thirteen and a half furlongs at Chester Racecourse in August and started at odds of 8/1. After being restrained in the early stages he moved into contention in the last half mile and took the lead a furlong out. Invermark pulled clear in the closing stages to win by three and a half lengths from the filly Delilah (Princess Royal Stakes) with the favourite Perfect Paradigm (Old Newton Cup) in third. Invermark was moved up significantly in class when he was sent to France for the Group 3 Prix Gladiateur over 3100 metres on very soft ground at Longchamp Racecourse on 6 September. Ridden by the locally based Olivier Peslier he led for most of the way before being overtaken in the closing stages and finishing fourth behind Tiraaz, Solo Mio and Asolo, beaten two lengths by the winner. Hughes was back in the saddle when the gelding returned to Longchamp for the Group 1 Prix du Cadran over 4000 metres on 3 October and started an 18.7/1 outsider. Tiraaz was made favourite, while the other seven runners included San Sebastian, Asolo, Canon Can (Doncaster Cup) and Three Cheers (Prix de Lut√®ce). Invermark raced towards the rear of the field as Canon Can set the pace, before being switched to the outside and making rapid progress in the straight. Tiraaz went to the front but Invermark overhauled the favourite in the last 100 metres and won by half a length, with the pair finishing four lengths clear of San Sebastian in third. Richard Hughes said \\"When I won on him at Chester the time before I sat last on him for most of the way and he never came off the bridle. He's not really quirky, but he's still a bit green and he's happier settled behind. As soon as I went past the other horse today he almost started pulling up. It would be a nightmare to go the whole way in front on him and I couldn't quite figure out what they were doing [in the Prix Gladiateur] last time\\". Three weeks later the gelding ended his season with another run at Longchamp but failed to reproduce his best form and came home last of the seven starters behind Tiraaz. =1999: five-year-old season= Invermark began his fourth campaign by finishing third under top weight of 136 pounds in the Chester Cup over two and a quarter miles on 5 May. On 17 June the gelding produced what was probably his best performance in the Gold Cup over two and a half miles at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Hughes he raced towards the rear before producing a strong late run and taking second place behind Enzeli in a field which also included Kayf Tara, Celeric, Nedawi and Persian Punch. Invermark returned to France for his last two races that year. In the Prix Kergorlay at Deauville Racecourse in August he stayed on well in the straight but proved no match for Kayf Tara and was beaten five lengths into second place. In October he attempted to repeat his 1998 victory in the Prix du Cadran but came home fourth behind Tajoun, San Sebastian and Divination. After the death of David Wills in December 1999 the ownership of Invermark passed to his widow Lady Wills (formerly Eva Kavanaugh). =Later career= Invermark was off the track for the whole of the 2000 season after sustaining a serious suspensory ligament injury. After an absence of nearly two years Invermark returned for a minor event over one and three quarter miles at Haydock on 28 September 2001 and started at odds of 8/1 in a twelve-runner field. Ridden by Hughes he produced a sustained run in the straight, took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a neck from Murghem. On his only other appearance of the year he started 2/1 favourite for the Jockey Club Cup at Newmarket on 20 October and finished a close second to the three-year-old Capal Garmon, with Royal Rebel and San Sebastian in third and fourth. Invermark returned as an eight-year-old and was ridden by Michael Hills in all three of his races. He ran fourth to Give Notice in the Sagaro Stakes at Ascot in May and then finished a close second to Akbar in the Henry II Stakes at Sandown. On his final racecourse appearance the gelding ran for the second time in the Ascot Gold Cup and came home seventh of the fifteen runners behind Royal Rebel.

Early life Elizabeth Somers was born in Waterford city on 14 October 1881. Her parents were William Somers, post office engineer, and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Walsh). Somers had at least 3 brothers. The family moved to Cork city in 1883 when her father was transferred there, where Somers attended a convent school. Her father died in 1891, and her mother was appointed postmistress of Whitegate, County Cork. As a pupil, Somers wrote for the children's magazine St. Patrick's edited by William O'Brien, even winning prizes. The family moved again in 1901, when Somers' mother became postmistress of Belmullet, County Mayo until 1908. Somers was moved by the poverty she saw there, and was elected as a poor law guardian for Belmullet shortly after she arrived there. She went on to become a supporter of Sinn F√©in, writing numerous articles for Arthur Griffith's journals. She used her name in Irish as her pen name, Lasarfhiona N√≠ Shamhraidin, Eilis Lasarfhiona or just Lasarfhiona. Somers also wrote for The Mayo News, and in the Irish Peasant with a regular column, \\"An grian√°n\\". Irish republicanism and advocacy Somers moved to Dalkey, County Dublin in 1908 with her mother who was again taking a position as the town postmistress. From here Somers was an active member of The Gaelic League and Sinn F√©in, as well as a supporter of Cumann na mBan and the Irish Volunteers. She eventually became the secretary of the local Cumann na mBan unit. Somers' campaign against Irish recruitment into the British Army in 1915 led to her mother losing her job as postmistress of Dalkey. This made her the first civil servant to lose her job due to her association with Irish republicanism. Her persistent lobbying of Matthew Nathan through correspondence led to her mother being reinstated at the end of World War I. Her brother, D.C. Somers, was sentenced to five years' penal servitude due to his participation in Easter 1916, and lost his job in the civil service. These led to the family suffering financially. Both her brothers, D.C. and Michael, served in the IRA during the Irish War of Independence. Somers was a public speaker and raised funds for Sinn F√©in from 1917 onwards. Somers was appointed secretary of the Dublin Industrial Development Association in 1917, an organisation which went on to become the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association (NAIDA). This was a lobbying group for small Irish businesses, advocating for protective tariffs to aid in the development of Irish industry. At the offices of the NAIDA at 3 St Stephen's Green, Somers oversaw a permanent exhibition of Irish Industries. Until her death, Somers was the public face and administrator of the NAIDA. While serving as the minister for industry and commerce, Se√°n Lemass described Somers as the NAIDA's \\"directing spirit\\" and noted her \\"heroic work\\". She was the instigator of the \\"Buy Irish\\" campaigns, encouraging the expansion and development of Irish industries. Somers was against the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, switching her allegiance to Fianna F√°il. Along with her unmarried brother, Michael, Somers lived with her mother. Somers developed heart disease in 1931 due to high blood pressure, leading to her sudden death from a heart attack on 28 December 1934.

Its features include continuous deployment from Git across Netlify Edge, the company's global application delivery network infrastructure, serverless form handling, support for AWS Lambda functions, and full integration with Let's Encrypt. It provides both free and paid plans. Netlify customers include Google, Facebook, Verizon, NBC, Samsung, Nike, Cisco, Atlassian, LiveChat, Unilever, TriNet, Loblaw, Wieden+Kennedy, HashiCorp, Vue.js, Citrix, Peloton, Kubernetes, Lodash, Smashing Magazine, and Sequoia Capital.  History  A predecessor to the company was founded in 2014 when Danish entrepreneur Mathias Biilmann noticed the emergence of Git-centered workflows with modern build tools and static sites generators, a shift he described as \\"a massive change happening in the web development space\\", while running MakerLoop, a content management startup based in San Francisco. In 2015, Biilmann invited Christian Bach, his childhood friend who was working as an executive at a creative services agency in Denmark, to join him as co-founder in his new venture. Netlify was publicly launched as a MakerLoop product on April 7, 2015. On December 19, 2017, MakerLoop filed a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of Delaware rebranding the entire company as Netlify. = Financing = On August 16, 2016, Netlify raised $2.1 million from the founders of GitHub, Heroku, and Rackspace Cloud. On August 9, 2017, the company announced that it had raised $12 million in series A funding from Andreessen Horowitz. On October 9, 2018, the company issued a press release announcing that it had completed a series B round led by Kleiner Perkins‚Äîwith participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Slack and Flickr co-founder Stewart Butterfield, Yelp CEO and co-founder Jeremy Stoppelman, among others‚Äîsecuring $30 million. On March 4, 2020, Netlify secured $53 million in a series C round led by EQT Ventures, the venture capital branch of Swedish investment company EQT, with contributions by existing investors Adreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, and newcomer Preston-Werner Ventures.  Products  = Netlify CMS = Netlify CMS dashboard. To address some of the limitations of static websites, which tend to be less sophisticated and harder to use for the website maintainer than a dynamic content publishing solution such as WordPress or Medium, Netlify develops its own open source headless content management system called Netlify CMS. = Jamstack = Jamstack is a cloud- native web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript code, reusable APIs, and markup content. It was pioneered and created by Netlify. In its purest form, the idea of Jamstack is that a web application is pre-built into static pages, using content and code to generate the output. In basic terms, Jamstack is a significant shift in focus from the now abstractable back end to the now-powerful front end.  Reception  In March 2017, Netlify CMS was named \\"GitHub project of the week\\" by the Software Development Times. On July 10, 2018, GitHub founder and former CEO Tom Preston-Werner predicted that \\"within 5 years, you'll build your next large scale, fully featured web app with JAMstack and deploy on Netlify.\\" In an October 2018 press release co- authored by Netlify, CodePen co-founder Chris Coyier stated that \\"this is where the web is going, Netlify is just bringing it to us all a lot faster.

He later became president of the Egbe Omo Oduduwa in 1953. Chief Maja held the chieftaincy titles of the Baba Eko (Father of Lagos in Yoruba) and the Jagunmolu of Orile-Ijaiye. A medical doctor by training, he graduated in 1918 from the University of Edinburgh and stayed in the U.K. for the next three years before returning to Nigeria in 1921. He briefly worked for the colonial government before going into private practice to set up his own clinic. Life Akinola Maja was born Sope Akinola Pearce. His father, James Adaramaja Pearce, was a carpenter, while his mother was a bread seller. The popular Breadfruit Street in his native Lagos is named so because of his mother's vocation. The Pearces belonged to the ascendant Saro community. Maja's father died young, and he was picked as the one child to be extensively educated and look after the rest of the family thereafter. His mother saved enough money to send him to school overseas. He arrived in Scotland shortly thereafter. A significant event in Maja's life occurred in 1918, where he was discriminated on the basis of his race. Maja had excelled academically and was due to be awarded a prize for best student at the graduation ceremony. His fellow students and the visiting guests were surprised to see that the best- performing student in the year was actually Nigerian, being mistaken by his surname. Maja was made to wait as the faculty confirmed that he had indeed won the prize for his academic results. Upon seeing the negative reaction to a black man winning the prize among his fellow students, Maja decided to renounce his foreign surname and shortened his father's middle name Adaramaja to Maja as a replacement. He also took an oath that none of his descendants would have non-Nigerian surnames, a tradition which is still carried on today by the male members of the Maja family. Upon his return to what was then Colonial Nigeria, Maja worked in the civil service for a time. Unsatisfied with the career prospects that this offered him, he eventually established a private practice in Lagos. In 1933, Maja was one of the founders of the National Bank of Nigeria, along with T.A. Doherty, Olatunde Johnson and Hamzat Subair. The bank was a durable African institution that later developed a close relationship with the Action Group political party. Some of the bank's founders where affiliated with the National Youth Movement, and they later established Service Press, the publishers of the Daily Service newspaper. Daily Service began operations as a mouth piece of the NYM. During the decade preceding Nigeria's independence, Maja was involved in a number of business ventures with varying degrees of success. In the early 1950s, he co-founded a ceramic venture in Ikorodu in partnership with Sule Gbadamosi. He was also a director of the National Investment and Properties Company used by the Action Group as a source of campaign finance. Maja was married to Chief Comfort Obasa Maja, a daughter of Prince Orisadipe Obasa. Chief Obasa Maja was the Erelu Kuti of Lagos, a chieftaincy title that made her the reigning queen mother of that kingdom. Maja had four children. The Majas lived at Garber Square, in one of the earliest two-storey buildings in Nigeria, and their residence is now part of the Lagos street tour due to its historical importance. His son, Dr. Oladipo Maja was a well-known doctor and philanthropist who set up the Maja Eye Hospital, whose charitable arm recruited the services of prominent ophthalmic surgeons to carry out free surgery for the blind and visually impaired. Maja died in 1976 at the age of 88.

The Corps existed from 1890 to 1951 and was located in the Prins Hendrikbarracks in Nijmegen. History Before the creation of the Colonial Reserve in 1890, a colonial recruitment depot existed in Harderwijk, founded around 1830. Initially the recruitment and training for the Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL) took place here. These included non-Dutch European volunteers. In general, that went without too many problems. It was not until after 1870 that it became more difficult for the Dutch military authorities to recruit sufficient foreign personnel, because countries such as France and Germany undertook measures to discourage the service of their nationals in the armies of foreign powers. The Ministry of Colonies and War was forced to focus on the recruitment of Dutch nationals as volunteers for colonial military service. These recruits were usually recruited in small numbers. Prins Hendrik BarracksThe Koloniaal Werfdepot had been popularly known as the 'gutterhole of Europe', because of the continued recruitment of mercenaries from all over Europe. For Dutch volunteers, service in the KNIL retained a certain social stigma; a prejudice which had a negative effect on recruitment numbers. At the end of the nineteenth century the awareness gradually arose at the Ministry of Colonies that the quality of the military personnel destined for the Dutch Indies had to be improved.https://www.huisvandenijmeegsegeschiedenis.nl/info/KNIL- soldaten_in_de_Prins_Hendrikkazerne In 1890 Lieutenant Colonel Josephus Fredericus Dominicus Bruinsma became the first commander of the Royal Corps Colony Reserve, established by Royal Decree of 24 August 1890, with Captain Johannes Rudolph Jacobs as his adjutant. The Corps was under the command of the Minister of Colonies and was set up to replace the Indian brigade, which had been authorized by Royal Decree of 9 March 1874, number 32, but which had not been successfully established. There was a need for such a reserve corps for the Colonies because the constitution prohibited the use of the Royal Netherlands Army for service outside Europe. The corps was also intended to prepare veteran colonial soldiers returning from the East and West Indies for reentry into Dutch civilian society. In the initial period, the staff of this corps was located in Zutphen, but the instructors and cadres were soon moved to Nijmegen and from 1911 the Prins Hendrik Barracks was their home base. Bruinsma was succeeded in April 1895 by Gijsbertus Godefriedus Johannes Notten as the second commander of the Colonial Reserve Corps. After first having been located in the Waal Barracks in the Lower Town (Benedenstad), the corps left for the newly built Prins Hendrik Barracks in 1911. The soldiers of the (KNIL) were popularly called \\"colonials\\". During their months of training, they were thoroughly prepared for the tropical Indies. They trained with field marches, practiced gymnastics and took lessons in fencing. They learned Malay and were given food from the Indies twice a week. The Corps was dissolved one year after the KNIL, in 1951.https://theses.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/123456789/3594/Bosschaart,%20M.%204482735%2015-08-2016.pdf?sequence=1 International Four Days Marches Nijmegen For the corps, remote mating was of great importance. In recruitment, for example, they could be used as a propaganda tool. The corps members, in fact, walked in striking exotic uniforms and showed themselves in different places to the population. On the other hand, the marches could also be used in the training of soldiers so that they would be well prepared for the long patrols in the Dutch East Indies. The Colonial Reserve was the basis of the Nijmegen Four Days Marches. The first edition, which was organized in 1909 by the Dutch Association for Physical Education (NBvLO), had a different design than today. During that edition, Nijmegen was only the end point of one of the routes. Three years later the Four Days Marches departed from Utrecht. On the third day, the participants then walked from Ede via the Betuwe to Nijmegen to spend the night there in the Prins Hendrik Barracks, home of the Colonial Reserve. On the last day there was a walk through the surroundings of Nijmegen and the barracks were again the end point. This pleased the organization so well that the barracks from 1925 up to and including 1946 were the starting point of the trip. Indies Nijmegen In the period between 1910 and 1930 several prosperous Nijmegen families who had become rich in the Dutch East Indies had built villas. Beautiful examples of mansions where retired KNIL officers have lived can be found at the Oranjesingel and the Groesbeekseweg. The KNIL soldiers were entitled to leave every six years and then returned to Nijmegen, the place where they had left. Depending on their grade, their leave lasted for six to twelve months. It was customary that people would come across accompanied with the whole family during their leave. In Nijmegen there are holiday homes at various places, including the Fransestraat, Javastraat and Burghardt van den Bergstraat in Nijmegen.

The area forms around two thirds of the area of the modern London Borough of Hackney, to which it gives its name. It is 4 miles (6.4 km) northeast of Charing Cross, and includes part of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Historically it was within the county of Middlesex. In the past it was also referred to as Hackney Proper to distinguish it from the village which subsequently developed in the vicinity of Mare Street, the term Hackney Proper being applied to the wider district. Hackney is a large district, whose long established boundaries encompass the sub-districts of Homerton, Dalston (including Kingsland and Shacklewell), De Beauvoir Town, Upper and Lower Clapton, Stamford Hill, Hackney Central, Hackney Wick, South Hackney and West Hackney. Governance Hackney Town Hall, now used for the modern borough Hackney was an administrative unit with consistent boundaries from the early Middle Ages to the creation of the larger modern borough in 1965. Hackney was based for many centuries on the Ancient Parish of Hackney, the largest in Middlesex. It is not known exactly when the parish formed, it may have initially been part of the parish of Stepney, as Hackney was initially a sub-manor of Stepney. Irrespective of whether the parish was independent from the introduction of the parish system, long before the Norman Conquest,Encyclopaedia Brittanica 1993, the article describes how the Parish system in England was already very old at the time of the Norman Conquest or whether it was an early sub-division of Stepney parish, the parish would have been based on the boundaries of this manor of Hackney at the time it was created. Any boundary changes to the manor after around 1180 would not be reflected in changes to the parish boundaries as, across England, they became fixed at around that time, so that boundaries could no longer be changed at all, despite changes to manorial landholdings - though there were some examples of sub-division in some parishes.History of the Countryside by Oliver Rackham, 1986 p19 The manorial system in England had largely broken down in England by 1400, with manors fragmenting and their role being much reduced. Parishes in Middlesex were grouped into Hundreds, with Hackney part of Ossulstone Hundred. Rapid Population growth around London saw the Hundred split into several 'Divisions' during the 1600s, with Hackney part of the Tower Division (aka Tower Hamlets). The Tower Division was noteworthy in that the men of the area owed military service to the Tower of London - and had done even before the creation of the Division.The London Encyclopaedia, 4th Edition, 1983, Weinreb and Hibbert The Ancient Parishes provided a framework for both civil (administrative) and ecclesiastical (church) functions, but during the nineteenth century there was a divergence into distinct civil and ecclesiastical parish systems. In London the Ecclesiastical Parishes sub- divided to better serve the needs of a growing population, while the Civil Parishes continued to be based on the same Ancient Parish areas. The Metropolis Management Act 1855 merged the Civil Parishes of Hackney and Stoke Newington under a new Hackney District. This proved very unpopular, especially in more affluent Stoke Newington and after four unsuccessful attempts the two parishes regained their independence when they were separated by mutual consent under the Metropolis Management (Plumstead and Hackney) Act of 1893. The London Government Act 1899 converted the parishes into Metropolitan Boroughs based on the same boundaries, sometimes with minor rationalisations. Neighbouring Stoke Newington was smaller than the desired size for the new boroughs, and there were proposals to re-merge Stoke Newington and Hackney, or to detach the northern part of Hackney and join it with Stoke Newington. These proposals were rejected due to the experience of ‚Äúintolerable and interminable feuds‚Äù between the districts when they were previously \\"forced together\\", and because the First Lord of the Treasury, Arthur Balfour recognised that there was \\"great ill-feeling and mutual ill-will... between the inhabitants of the two districts\\".Arthur Balfour, Hansard:Vol 71, Col 979, https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1899/may/18/london- government-bell In 1965, Hackney merged with Shoreditch and Stoke Newington to form the new London Borough of Hackney. Hackney's traditional boundaries, together with electoral wards as of 1916 Prior to 1994, a small part of Victoria Park was part of Hackney, but a minor boundary alteration was made so that the whole park came under the control of Tower Hamlets. Place name origin The first surviving records of the place name are as Hakney (1231) and Hakeneye (1242 and 1294). The name is Old English, but the meaning is not certain. It seems clear however that the ‚Äòey‚Äô element refers to an island or a raised or otherwise dry area in marshland. The term 'island' in this context can also mean land situated between two streams.The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, Eilert Ekwall, 1990 The 'island' may have been beside the Lea or perhaps near the confluence of the Hackney Brook and Pigwell Brook in the Hackney Central area. The Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names examined various interpretations of the place name and favoured the interpretation that Hackney means ‚ÄòHaka‚Äôs island‚Äô, with Haka being a notable local person The Dictionary suggests that the ‚ÄòHack‚Äô element may also derive from: * The Old English ‚ÄòHaecc‚Äô meaning a hatch ‚Äì an entrance to a woodland or common. * Or alternatively from ‚ÄòHaca‚Äô meaning a hook, and in this context, a bend of the river. * James Rendel Harris theorised that 'Hack' means 'woodpecker.' Picus Who Is Also Zeus, J. Rendel Harris, 1916 History =Pre-Roman= Hackney is a mostly low-lying area in proximity to two rivers, the Lea and the Hackney Brook. This would have made the area attractive for pastoral and arable agriculture, meaning most of the area is likely to have been deforested at an early date. There is archaeological evidence for settlement and agriculture as far back as the Stone Age.https://historicengland.org.uk/content/docs/planning/apa-hackney-pdf/ During the late Iron Age, the area was part of the territory of the powerful Catuvellauni tribe. =Roman= There will have been a network of probably minor, local roads in Hackney before the Romans conquered southern Britain after 43AD, but the areas proximity to the provincial capital, Londinium, meant that it was soon crossed by two large long-distance routes. The first was Ermine Street (modern A10) which emerged from Bishopsgate and headed north to Lincoln and York. The second was a route which branched off Ermine Street just outside Bishopsgate and headed SW-NE across Hackney, across the Dalston, Hackney Central and Lower Clapton areas to cross to the Lea on its way to Great Dunmow in Essex.http://www.lamas.org.uk/images/documents/Transactions59/039-060%20Crown%20Wharf.pdf This crossing appears to have crossed the Lea 168 metres south of the Bridge at Mandeville Street near Millfields Road (sometimes known as Pond Lane Bridge).p54 http://www.lamas.org.uk/images/documents/Transactions59/039-060%20Crown%20Wharf.pdf Three Roman sarcophagus burials have been found, two of stone and one of marble. These, particularly the marble example indicate a high status settlement of some sort. The stone examples had a coin hoard found nearby. =Anglo-Saxon= The area around Millfields Park, Lower Clapton is sometimes described as the site of a battle in which Aescwine, having rebelled against Octa, King of Kent, defeats him in battle and becomes the (reputed) first King of Essex. The ford over the Lea is referred to in the (much later) accounts of the battle. Historical records describing this period are extremely sparse, so the historicity of the battle, and even Aescwine himself is disputed. The place name Hackney is Old English, so was probably first applied in this era. Hackney was part of the territory of the Middle Saxons, a people who seem to have formed a province of the East Saxons, albeit not part of their core territory. The area was a part of the huge manor of Stepney, an area owned by the Bishop of London, and its great size and proximity to the City means it may have been part of the grant of land made when the Diocese of London (The East Saxon Diocese), was re-established in 604 AD. Later, the Middle and East Saxon area would become subject to various other Kingdoms, culminating in Wessex as it led a long process to unite England as it rolled back the partial Viking conquest of the country. A coin of Egbert of Wessex was found on Stamford Hill. The Kings of Wessex divided their kingdom into shires, with Hackney becoming part of the shire of Middlesex, an area named after the Middle Saxons. =The Norman Conquest= After their victory at Hastings the Normans needed to secure London. To this end they burned Southwark, crossed the river upstream and harried much of Middlesex and Hertfordshire. The Manor of Stepney was less badly hit than much of the rest of Middlesex, though the area along Ermine Street (the A10), in Hackney, is believed to have been badly affected.Medieval London Suburbs, Kevin McDonnell, Phillimore Publishing, 1978 p 14 The Domesday Book of 1086 covered England at manorial level, so Hackney is only assessed as part of Manor of Stepney, of which it was a sub-manor. The landscape at this time was largely agricultural, Domesday returns for Middlesex indicate that it was around 30% wooded (much of it wood-pasture), about double the English average.Trees and Woodland in the British Landscape, Rackham, p50 Hackney would have had a lower proportion than the county as a whole, consisting of mostly lower land, close to rivers that made it more attractive for farming. The proportion of woodland in England decreased sharply between the Conquest and the Black DeathTrees and Woodland in the British Landscape, Rackham, p55 due to the pressure of a rapidly increasing population, and the same pressures would have been experienced here. =Post- medieval= From the Tudor period onwards, the various settlements in Hackney grew as wealthy Londoners moved to what they saw as a pleasant rural alternative to living in London; but which was, nonetheless close to the capital - in some ways it was comparable to a modern commuter town. A number of royal courtiers lived in Homerton, while Henry VIII had a palace at Brooke House, Upper Clapton, where Queen Mary took the Oath of Supremacy. Sutton House, the oldest surviving residential building in the district was built in 1535. Morris Dancers perform at Sutton House. =Urbanisation= The main ‚ÄòHackney Village‚Äô grew much larger than the others, in 1605 having as many houses as Dalston, Newington (ie West Hackney), Kingsland and Shacklewell combined. In 1727 Daniel Defoe said of the hamlets of Hackney The growth of the East End of London was stimulated by the building of Regent's Canal between 1812‚Äì6, with construction work on a new town at De Beauvoir beginning in 1823 and continuing through the 1830s. The arrival of the railways, around 1850, accelerated the spread of London and the expansion of the existing nuclei, so that Hackney was almost entirely built up by 1870. Victorian housing stock at Cassland Road and Cassland Crescent, South Hackney =Edwardian= In 1907, the Fifth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party held at the Brotherhood Church on the east side of Southgate Road. The conference was held in the UK after being banned in other countries. The Christian Socialist Brotherhood Church, on Southgate Road, hosted a congress attended by Lenin, Stalin and other Russian radicals Attendees included Lenin, Stalin, Maxim Gorky, Rosa Luxemburg and Leon Trotsky. The congress debated strategy for a communist revolution in Russia and strengthened the position of Lenin's Bolshevik and debated strategy for a communist revolution in Russia.https://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/heritage/southgate-road-de- beauvoir-chapel-lenin-russian-october-revolution-1917-1-5245129 =World War One= The first bomb of the first air raid on London, fell on 16 Alkham Road, West Hackney in May 2015. The German Army airship LZ 38 had begun the first assault on the capital by a foreign power since William the Conqueror ravaged Southwark and the countryside around London ‚Äì including parts of Hackney, in 1066.

The 2/10th was assigned to the 175th (2/3rd London) Brigade, in the 58th (2/1st London) Division, fighting on the western front and finishing the war in the Peruwelz area of Belgium. A third Hackney battalion, the 3/10th was based in the UK and used as a training unit, providing reinforcements to the two frontline battalions. details on the wartime service of the 1/10th and 2/10th Hackney https://www.forces-war- records.co.uk/units/4899/london-regiment =Blitz= Hackney was badly affected by wartime bombing that left the area with 749 civilian war dead, with many more of its citizens injured or left homeless. Many other Hackney residents were also killed on active service around the world. The number of devices hitting Hackney was upwards of 613 high explosive bombs, 16 parachute mines, 37 V-1 'doodlebugs', 10 V-2 rockets and many thousands of 1kg incendiary devices.Bomb density records http://planningdocs.hackney.gov.uk/NorthgatePublicDocs/00092912.pdf Notable buildings destroyed by bombing included Tudor-era Brooke House in Upper Clapton and West Hackney church. =Post-war and Olympic Games= The post-war period saw extensive re-building, and the area became increasingly multi- cultural in character. During the 1930s, 1940s and 1960s the area's large Jewish and other minority populations made it a target for provocative rallies by Oswald Mosley and the far-right organisations he founded. These were actively opposed by many local people, together with organisations such as the 43 Group and this led to a number of violent confrontations, notably in the Ridley Road area of Dalston. Hackney was one of the host areas when London staged the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, with three venues falling within its part of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park: * Copper Box Arena hosted events including Handball, Modern Pentathlon and Goalball. This 7,000 seat multi- sport venue is still used for community and elite sport. * The Riverbank Arena was a temporary venue which hosted Field Hockey during the Olympics, and Football 7-a-side and Football 5-a-side during the Paralympics. * London Olympics Media Centre. The facility is still in use and now known as Here East. =Affordable housing= Hackney's solution to affordable housing has been able to put more affordable housing on the market by making use of inclusionary practices. This district built a significant number of affordable units and subsidised them with market rate units. In Hackney about half of the new units are affordable. In an effort to avoid displacing current residents, construction was completed in phases. Geography The outline of Hackney's traditional boundary resembles a right-angled triangle with the right-angle in the SW and the Lower Lea Valley, running NW-SE forming the hypotenuse. The western boundary is based on the N-S axis of the Roman A10, though the sub- district of De Beauvoir Town lies beyond it, as do small areas of Dalston and Stamford Hill. The district's southern boundary follows the Regents Canal- Hertford Union Canal in part, and for the remainder marches a little to the north of it, with Victoria Park also forming part of the southern boundary. The highest points around Stamford Hill and Clapton Common are over 30m AOD, with the lowest areas being along the River Lea. The Hackney Brook was the largest natural internal watercourse, entering Hackney in the NW, at the foot of the southern foot of Stamford Hill and exiting in the south-east, however this watercourse was fully culverted in the 19th century. The boundaries of Hackney take in the sub-districts of Homerton, Dalston (including Kingsland and Shacklewell), De Beauvoir Town, Upper and Lower Clapton, Stamford Hill, Hackney Central, Hackney Wick, South Hackney and West Hackney. The Lea and Hackney Marshes are underlain by alluvium soils; and the higher ground between Homerton and Stamford Hill is formed on a widening bed of London Clay. Brickearth deposits are within tongues of clay extending beneath Clapton Common, Stamford Hill and Stoke Newington High Street. The centre and south western districts lie on river terrace deposits of Taplow Gravel. The area around Victoria Park and Well Street Common lie on flood plain gravel. Open spaces Open spaces in Hackney include: * Clapton CommonClapton Common 30 June 2009 (Planning Inspectorate Casework) accessed 19 Sept 2009 * Hackney Downs * Hackney Marshes * Mabley Green * London Fields * Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (part) * Springfield Park and Spring Hill Recreation Ground * Stoke Newington Common, originally known as Cockhangar Green, and part of Hackney rather than Stoke Newington proper * Victoria Park (outside of Hackney, but forming part of the southern boundary) * Well Street Common * West Hackney Recreation Ground Transport = Rail = Hackney is served by six stations, including by the London Overground at Hackney Central railway station, and it is named after the central area of Hackney, as well as Hackney Downs. Central was open by the North London Railway opened as Hackney on 26 September 1850, to the east of Mare Street. It closed on 1 December 1870 and was replaced the same day by a station to the west of Mare Street, designed by Edwin Henry Horne and also named Hackney. This station passed in due course to the London & North Western Railway and later on to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, which closed the entire North London Line east of Dalston Junction to passenger traffic in 1944. Downs was opened on 27 May 1872 when the Great Eastern Railway opened the first part of its new line from Enfield Town to Stoke Newington.Forgotten Stations of Greater London by J.E.Connor and B.HalfordChronology of London Railways by H.V.Borley A pedestrian link between Hackney Downs and Hackney Central stations was opened in 2015 by London Overground Rail Operations. Until Hackney Central's closure in 1944, a passenger connection had linked the two stations. However, when Hackney Central re-opened in 1985, the footway was not reinstated and passengers transferring between the two stations were obliged to leave one and walk along the street to the other, until the link was rebuilt. Hackney Wick opened on 12 May 1980 by British Rail on the re-routed line which bypassed the site of the former Victoria Park station as part of the CrossTown Link line. In 1872, London Fields railway station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway.Body, p.109 It closed in 1981 due to a fire, repairs were eventually carried out and the station reopened in 1986.\\"A Very Political Railway\\" De Burton, Alan; Electric Railway Society 4 March 2015; Retrieved 23 May 2016 In February 2006, a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) report called Horizon 2020 was commissioned, which suggested that the DLR be extended to Hackney Central from Bow Church via Old Ford and Homerton, taking over the old parts of the North London Line to link up with Poplar and Canary Wharf. = Buses = Hackney is served by a large number of London Buses routes, 26, 30, 38, 55, 56, 106, 149, 236, 242, 253, 254, 276, 277, 388, 394, 339, 425 and 488 as well as the D6, and W15. Hackney is also served by the London night bus network with routes N26, N38, N55 and N253 all running in the area. Route N277 also serves here when the 277 route was withdrawn between Dalston and Highbury Corner and the N277 was retained.

Outdoor group fitness classes led by a personal trainer or a fitness professional became a popular form of outdoor exercise. A variety of training courses for fitness professionals and certifications for companies specialising in outdoor fitness developed. Outdoor fitness can be studied as a specialism of exercise physiology. The trend towards outdoor fitness led to a proliferation of outdoor gyms.

One of these projects that is occurring in Mexico is the ISFL Program whose goal is to protect and manage forests. They also help fund the UCW Project that aims at doing research on child labor and the public policy that causes it so that they can help prevent this from occurring. Another funded project is the Proyecto Guadalajara to help promote environmental management systems to help small and medium-sized enterprises learn to stop polluting the environment. For a project that helps production and selling of grain, they helped establish the Grain Storage and Information Services for Agricultural Competitiveness.

This result admits an analogous statement for measures on the real line. It was first discovered by Norbert Wiener. Statement * Given a real or complex Borel measure \\\\mu on the unit circle \\\\mathbb T, let \\\\mu_a=\\\\sum_j c_j\\\\delta_{z_j} be its atomic part (meaning that \\\\mu(\\\\\\\\{z_j\\\\\\\\})=c_j eq 0 and \\\\mu(\\\\\\\\{z\\\\\\\\})=0 for z ot\\\\in\\\\\\\\{z_j\\\\\\\\}. Then :\\\\lim_{N\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{2N+1}\\\\sum_{n=-N}^N\\\\widehat\\\\mu(n)^2=\\\\sum_jc_j^2, where \\\\widehat{\\\\mu}(n)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb T}z^{-n}\\\\,d\\\\mu(z) is the n-th Fourier coefficient of \\\\mu. * Similarly, given a real or complex Borel measure \\\\mu on the real line \\\\mathbb R and called \\\\mu_a=\\\\sum_j c_j\\\\delta_{x_j} its atomic part, we have :\\\\lim_{R\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{2R}\\\\int_{-R}^R\\\\widehat\\\\mu(\\\\xi)^2\\\\,d\\\\xi=\\\\sum_jc_j^2, where \\\\widehat{\\\\mu}(\\\\xi)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R}e^{-2\\\\pi i\\\\xi x}\\\\,d\\\\mu(x) is the Fourier transform of \\\\mu. Proof * First of all, we observe that if u is a complex measure on the circle then :\\\\frac{1}{2N+1}\\\\sum_{n=-N}^N\\\\widehat{ u}(n)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb T}f_N(z)\\\\,d u(z), with f_N(z)=\\\\frac{1}{2N+1}\\\\sum_{n=-N}^N z^{-n}. The function f_N is bounded by 1 in absolute value and has f_N(1)=1, while f_N(z)=\\\\frac{z^{N+1}-z^{-N}}{(2N+1)(z-1)} for z\\\\in\\\\mathbb{T}\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}, which converges to 0 as N\\\\to\\\\infty. Hence, by the dominated convergence theorem, :\\\\lim_{N\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{2N+1}\\\\sum_{n=-N}^N\\\\widehat{ u}(n)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb T}1_{\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}}(z)\\\\,d u(z)= u(\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}). We now take \\\\mu' to be the pushforward of \\\\overline\\\\mu under the inverse map on \\\\mathbb T, namely \\\\mu'(B)=\\\\overline{\\\\mu(B^{-1})} for any Borel set B\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb T. This complex measure has Fourier coefficients \\\\widehat{\\\\mu'}(n)=\\\\overline{\\\\widehat{\\\\mu}(n)}. We are going to apply the above to the convolution between \\\\mu and \\\\mu', namely we choose u=\\\\mu*\\\\mu', meaning that u is the pushforward of the measure \\\\mu\\\\times\\\\mu' (on \\\\mathbb T\\\\times\\\\mathbb T) under the product map \\\\cdot:\\\\mathbb{T}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{T}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{T}. By Fubini's theorem :\\\\widehat{ u}(n)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{T}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{T}}(zw)^{-n}\\\\,d(\\\\mu\\\\times\\\\mu')(z,w) =\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb T}\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb T}z^{-n}w^{-n}\\\\,d\\\\mu'(w)\\\\,d\\\\mu(z)=\\\\widehat{\\\\mu}(n)\\\\widehat{\\\\mu'}(n)=\\\\widehat{\\\\mu}(n)^2. So, by the identity derived earlier, \\\\lim_{N\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{2N+1}\\\\sum_{n=-N}^N\\\\widehat{\\\\mu}(n)^2= u(\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\})=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb T\\\\times\\\\mathbb T}1_{\\\\\\\\{zw=1\\\\\\\\}}\\\\,d(\\\\mu\\\\times\\\\mu')(z,w). By Fubini's theorem again, the right-hand side equals :\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb T}\\\\mu'(\\\\\\\\{z^{-1}\\\\\\\\})\\\\,d\\\\mu(z)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb T}\\\\overline{\\\\mu(\\\\\\\\{z\\\\\\\\})}\\\\,d\\\\mu(z)=\\\\sum_j\\\\mu(\\\\\\\\{z_j\\\\\\\\})^2=\\\\sum_jc_j^2. * The proof of the analogous statement for the real line is identical, except that we use the identity :\\\\frac{1}{2R}\\\\int_{-R}^R\\\\widehat u(\\\\xi)\\\\,d\\\\xi=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R}f_R(x)\\\\,d u(x) (which follows from Fubini's theorem), where f_R(x)=\\\\frac{1}{2R}\\\\int_{-R}^R e^{-2\\\\pi i\\\\xi x}\\\\,d\\\\xi. We observe that f_R\\\\le 1, f_R(0)=1 and f_R(x)=\\\\frac{e^{2\\\\pi iRx}-e^{-2\\\\pi iRx}}{4\\\\pi iRx} for x eq 0, which converges to 0 as R\\\\to\\\\infty. So, by dominated convergence, we have the analogous identity :\\\\lim_{R\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{2R}\\\\int_{-R}^R\\\\widehat u(\\\\xi)\\\\,d\\\\xi= u(\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}). Consequences * A real or complex Borel measure \\\\mu on the circle is diffuse (i.e. \\\\mu_a=0) if and only if \\\\lim_{N\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{2N+1}\\\\sum_{n=-N}^N\\\\widehat\\\\mu(n)^2=0. * A probability measure \\\\mu on the circle is a Dirac mass if and only if \\\\lim_{N\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{2N+1}\\\\sum_{n=-N}^N\\\\widehat\\\\mu(n)^2=1. (Here, the nontrivial implication follows from the fact that the weights c_j are positive and satisfy 1=\\\\sum_j c_j^2\\\\le\\\\sum_j c_j\\\\le 1, which forces c_j^2=c_j and thus c_j=1, so that there must be a single atom with mass 1.)

Her work was significant in Miami and Cuban art communities of the later Twentieth Century and covered by many critics and scholars. Life =Early years= Lourdes was born in Havana in 1933. Her family was well- established in Cuba and she was raised in Havana's wealthy Vedado neighborhood of stately homes. Her grandfather was Cuban leader Porfirio Franca (born 1878), a lawyer, banker, and economist who was a member of Cuba's Pentarchy of 1933. Her early life, however, was marked by repeated tragedy that proved to be highly formative to her life and artistic career. Her mother, Josefina, was killed by thieves when Lourdes was 10 months old, causing her father to subsequently deteriorate mentally and physically as he suffered from depression, tuberculosis, and possibly schizophrenia. He was institutionalized when Lourdes was five, after which she and her older sister were raised by their grandparents. Their father died in 1946 when they were 13 and 14, respectively. Lourdes and her sister were both present in the hospital and witnessed his last words. Their grandfather then died in 1950. Art proved to be a powerful outlet for Lourdes early on. She started painting as an untrained prodigy by the age of three, focusing mainly on religious themes such as the Madonna and Child for her first years. She was encouraged by teachers while attending the Escuela de Margot Parraga, the St. George's School, and the Merici Academy. She formally studied painting at the prestigious Academia San Alejandro at the age of 20. By the 1950s Havana newspapers and art critics were praising her impressionistic style. One of her non-religious painting series covered were domestic depictions of her grandfather's home, showing its high ceiling, marble floors, and curving grand staircase. She first became a known and respected artist in Cuba at this time, even championed by leading Cuban art figures such as Victor Manuel and Carlos Enriquez. By the end of the decade, however, her life would take several dramatic turns that resulted in major shifts in her career. =Paris period= Lourdes had achieved significant early success and recognition in her home country during its mid-century artistic flourishing. Despite this, she wanted to expand her audience and be known outside of Cuba, as well as learn new skills. She then went to Paris in 1957 at the age of 24 and spent several months there. Though spanning less than a year, this period proved to be a highly significant and pivotal point in her life and career. She studied fine art directly under two leading masters of the time, learning painting from Andre Lhote and etching and engraving from Stanley Hayter. She was living in the Cite Universite and immersed in the mid-century Parisian art scene. It was also in this time when schizophrenia began to surface in Lourdes' life, a key development that greatly impacted much of her work thereafter. Though it was initially gradual, it became progressively worse until she experienced a sexual assault incident that precipitated a mental breakdown. She was then hospitalized shortly afterwards, her first in a series of mental health hospitalizations throughout her life. After her Paris hospitalization, Lourdes returned to Cuba accompanied by a psychiatrist and for a short time was able to find a new balance in her life. She would revisit her traumatic Paris period several times in later paintings and poems. = Miami period and later life = Following the events of the Cuban Revolution and Fidel Castro's rise to power, Lourdes relocated permanently to Miami in November 1960. She would remain there and continue to paint the rest of her life until her death in 2018. Over the course of her more than fifty-year career in the United States, she participated in several exhibitions of her paintings and published poetry collections in both Spanish and English. As in Cuba, Lourdes was a significant presence in the exile community in Miami but often struggled to expand her audience beyond it into a broader mainstream. This was partly due to the crippling impact of her mental health on her career when it came to sustaining high-profile events such as book launches and major art exhibitions, which would remain a constant regret for the remainder of her life. Despite this, she befriended several prominent figures in the South Florida art market who would become important contacts for her throughout the enduring Miami period of her career. Chief among these contacts was Coral Gables-based Cuban fine art patron, dealer, and collector Marta Permuy. Their relationship was a significant aspect of Lourdes' US career as she became a key figure in the Permuy Gallery during the 1970s as well as Permuy's subsequent art salon social circles in the decades following. Lourdes painted portraits of the Permuy family and Permuy was a frequent dealer of her artwork for much of her career. Lourdes would often use her private Coral Gables residence, the Permuy House, as a studio to paint. The two remained close friends with Lourdes referring to Permuy as \\"mi hermana\\" (\\"my sister\\") in portraits; the two ultimately died within months of each other (Permuy in 2017 and Lourdes in 2018). Permuy also introduced Lourdes to leading Latin American art collectors Marcos and Josefina Pinedo, who would also become major collectors of her work. Another prominent art dealer and promoter of Lourdes' artwork was Coconut Grove-based Barbara Greene. Greene represented her for ten years from 1993 to Greene's death in 2003. She became an emphatic supporter of Lourdes after seeing one of her paintings of a cathedral over a fireplace at the home of artist Pablo Cano. She was active in the period of Gomez Franca's career that included the launch of her last poetry collection, El Ni√±o De Guano. Other significant friends and professional contacts included fellow Cuban exile artists Dionisio Perkins (b. 1929) and Miguel Jorge. The three would often attend art and social events as a trio and had supported as well as influenced each other's work and careers. Lourdes and Perkins had known each other from their youth in Cuba while Jorge lived in close proximity to the Permuy Gallery. Jorge, who died in 1984, wrote the artist statement used for Lourdes' 1981 solo exhibition in Coral Gables. Pablo Cano also became a key friend and artistic collaborator. In addition to introducing Greene to Lourdes, the two worked together on her last two poetry collections published in her lifetime. Cano, thirty years her junior and now better known for his sculptural work, provided the illustrations to each poem in a style that was strongly reminiscent of Lourdes' own, reflecting her influence on him as a mentor.  Style  Stylistically, Lourdes is known for her vivid use of color, heavy impasto, and flowing, childlike Expressionistic imagery. She displayed a deliberate lack of realism with her distinct expressionism that occasionally incorporated aspects of Surrealism and Fauvism, such as curving and floating objects, vivid and unnaturally colored faces, disproportionate size, and so on. She also frequently used symbolism, such as in her color and stylistic choices (e.g. painting individuals blue during their \\"blue periods\\") to express more in layers. Noted Cuban art historian Lynette Bosch described lourdes as \\"a strong painter\\" who used high color contrast as signature feature, creating an \\"emotional chiaroscuro\\" effect. Her subject matter ranged from interpretive portraits of friends to lush landscapes, often rural and tropical, and seasides recalling both scenes of her childhood in Cuba as well as new found inspiration from life in Miami. Her Cuba-inspired work was often a nostalgic look back to Cuba as a Paradise Lost that resonated deeply with both the Cuban exile community as well as those who had never been to Cuba since the decades-long embrago, enhancing its mystique. Other common themes and series include still lifes (especially flowers and fruit), animals associated with Cuba (especially roosters and fish), and spiritual imagery, such as angels and the Virgin Mary. She left many of her works untitled and undated, letting them speak for themselves in her typically pure and straightforward manner; when titles are given, they are likewise simple, unpretentious, and directly descriptive. She usually signed her paintings simply with \\"Lourdes\\" (as she was known by most) and on occasion would leave preliminary sketches on the backside of her canvases, offering a playful glimpse into her creative process. Many of her works are introspective and psychological, showing unique glimpses into her perspective as a female immigrant as well as her life-long struggle with mental illness. As such, she captured the world as she saw and experienced it. Her paintings often reflected her immediate moods in the moment they were painted, serving as snapshots of her frame of mind in that general period. As such, those works painted in darker periods of her life were often departures of her \\"classic\\" style, instead using darker colors and more muddied composition.

She won several awards, including Second Prize for oil Painting from the CINTAS Foundation in 1966, Third Prize for oil painting during the 1966 University of Miami Group Exhibition, and First Prize for oil painting in the 1969 Arcadia Exhibition. Her career was covered extensively by media in both Cuba and the United States,https://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/sur-de-la- florida/article1997039.htmlhttps://www.elnuevoherald.com/entretenimiento/article18688653.html conducted several interviews, and was profiled by El Nuevo Herald (including \\"Lourdes Gomez Franca ‚Äì Imagenes Tortuadas\\"; June 27, 1988 and \\"Lourdes Gomez Franca: De La Furia A La Calma Una Tragica Historia Personal\\"; June 10, 1990) and The Palm Beach Post (\\"An Artist and Her Demon\\"; July 18, 1993 ‚Äì redistributed on the San Francisco Chronicle, August 15, 1993). Lourdes has been praised by leading scholars in Cuban art. Prominent Cuban art critic and Smithsonian Institute affiliate Giulio V. Blanc, who famously coined the term \\"the Miami Generation,\\" called her \\"The most underrated artist in Miami\\" in Arts Magazine. He also wrote the foreword for her 1989 book The Thorns Are Green My Friend, a poetry collection written primarily during one of her hospitalizations. In it, he said of Victor Manuel and Enriquez \\"That these two notoriously acerbic and difficult men should have found something to praise in Lourdes is telling.\\" He also went on to describe Gomez Franca as \\"an undiscovered Treasure of Miami.\\" She has also been discussed in several books by noted Cuban art historians, such as Cuban-American Literature and Art: Negotiating Identities (by Isabel Alvarez Borland and Lynette M. F. Bosch, 2009), Cuban-American Art in Miami: Exile, Identity and the Neo-Baroque (Lynette M. F. Bosch, 2004), Memoria : Cuban art of the 20th century (by Jos√© Veigas, Cristina Vives, Adolfo V Nodal, Valia Garz√≥n, and Dannys Montes de Oca; 2009) and Paradise Lost or Gained: The Literature of Hispanic Exile (by Fernando Alegria and Jorge Ruffinelli, 1990). Lourdes was also featured on the 1993 Art Now Gallery Guide: National & international (Volume 12, Issues 7-8) and 1990 edition of Arts Magazine (Volume 65, Issues 1-4). Her work is included in the University of Miami's Lowe Art Museum as well as several prominent collections of Cuban art, including the Permuy and Pinedo collections.

All of them (PLIN1,ADRP,TIP47,S3-12 and PLIN5) have similar functionality, relating to lipid droplets. They have a 1,252% similarity with 76 identical positions. On the other hand, PLIN5 has its most similarity with PLINS 2 and 3, with over 150 similar positions and 18,644% similarity.  Structure  Perilipin 5 is a relatively large protein. It is composed of 463 amino acids, weighing an average of 50.8 kDa. It contains four basic regions: * from amino acid 1 to 173: key region for lipid droplet targeting. * from amino acid 1 to 108: interaction with LIPE, a gene that encodes the formation of hormone-sensitive lipase, also known as HSL, whose main function is to mobilize the previously stored fats. * from amino acid 185 to 463: interactions with PNPLA2 and ABHD5. * from amino acid 444 to 463: targets mitochondria for lipid droplet- mitochondria association. PLIN5 is expressed in 183 organs, having its highest expression level on the stomach fundus. Protein Kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates residues 2, 148 and 322. Phosphorylation by PKA enables lipolysis probably by promoting the release of ABHD5 from the perilipin scaffold. = Evolution = Perilipins are considered to have evolved from a common ancestral gene. This family began to split during the first and second vertebrate genome duplication, giving birth to six types of PLIN genes, expressed throughout the animal kingdom. However, not all types are present in all animals. In fish, PLIN 1 to 6 can be found, whereas in mammals only PLIN1 to 5. Perilipin-5 possible evolution and its expressions in other species  Function  Perilipin 5 is a protein often found in the adipose tissue, especially in those with high oxidative stress, including the heart, liver, skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue (BAT). The perilipin family contributes to the creation of lipid droplets and it also plays a pivotal role in determining what the lipid droplet's function is within the cell. In addition, perilipin 5 regulates the activation of hepatic stellate cell, implicated in fibrosis, which is the creation of new tissue to repair the one damaged. The 3D structure of Perilipin 5 on humans. It is 66.122% identical to PLIN5 on rats, with 80 identical spots. = Beta oxidation = PLIN5, as well as the other members of this protein family, is involved in lipid storage and also has energetic functions. Perilipin 5 coats the lipid droplet acting as a barrier to triglyceride, thus increasing its storage. Under basal condition, PLIN5 decreases lipolysis to prevent energy waste. If energy is needed, perilipin facilitates lipid droplets with lipases and promotes enzymatic activity, regulating energy consumption. = Perilipin 5-Nucleus interactions = The mechanism by which OXPAT5 balances energy remain to be fully clarified. It interacts mainly with LDs, though recent data suggest that this protein also targets the nucleus. When needed, perilipin 5 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, which allows it to access the nucleus and enter the complex SIRT1/PGC-1Œ±, involved in fatty acid oxidation. PLIN5 removes SIRT1 inhibitor DBC1, therefore increasing its activity. As a consequence, PGC-1Œ± boost activity levels activating certain types of genes that enhances mitochondrial function. PLIN5 is phosphorylated and it accesses the nucleus displacing DBC1 inhibitor = Mitochondria and Perilipin 5 = Higher levels of perilipin 5 are closely related to the association between lipid droplet and mitochondria. This is useful in case of starvation (energy shortage). When energy is needed and no glucose is available, the cell uses lipids to feed itself. In order to do that, lipid droplets move towards the mitochondria to transfer the stored fatty acids. The perilipin family opens the channel, giving way to lipids to access the mitochondria. On the other hand, this association may occur with the aim of protecting the mitochondria against toxic levels of fatty acids in the cytosol. = Mean Corspuscular Volume = PLIN5 is an enhancer of the erythrocytes count in blood, as well as hemoglobin concentration. = Lipid Droplet Formation = Mammalian Plin's are not necessary for Lipid Droplet biogenesis, but as they are the primary regulators of lipolysis, they control cellular TAG/CE levels, long-chains whose functions is to provide enough metabolic precursors as polar lipids, which will then create Lipid Droplets.  Clinical importance  PLIN5 is an important regulator of cardiac and liver LDs. Both overexpression and deficiency result in serious consequences. = Overexpression = Perilipin 5 overexpression causes LD enlargement, accumulation of triglycerides (TAG) and mitochondria dysfunction, causing severe health issues.  Cardiac steatosis  An increase in PLIN5 expression leads to the accumulation of triglyceride content and to the enlargement of LDs and a reduction in its number. This results in cardiac steatosis, an abnormal retention of lipids within a cell. Despite massive steatosis, overexpression of cardiac PLIN5 is compatible with normal heart function and lifespan. Overexpression of PLIN5 also results in concentric hypertrophia on the left ventricle.  Fragmentation of mitochondria  Overexpression of PLIN5 causes a decrease in mitochondria function as it leads to the \\"recruitment\\" of mitochondria to the LD and its fragmentation. This results in smaller mitochondrial structures partly or completely surrounding individual LDs or entire LD cluster. Such LD-mitochondria assemblies typically move in unison due to their tight association. This aberrant mitochondrial phenotype was only observed in close proximity to LDs. Fractions of mitochondria located apart from LD were still elongated.  Fatty liver disease  PLIN5 plays an important role in regulating lipid accumulation and its breakdown in the liver. It appears that statins, a class of lipid- lowering medication, were effective in treating fatty liver diseases in non- alcoholic patients, as it decreased the hepatic expression of PLIN5, thus decreasing lipid accumulation. = Deficiency = When LDs are lost due to a deficiency in PLIN5, FAs are not sequestered as TAG in LD and therefore larger amounts of FAs are oxidized in the mitochondria leading to an excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Medium and high concentrations of ROS can induce apoptosis and eventually cause necrosis through oxidative stress. PLIN deficiency also reduces superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Furthermore, deficiency in PLIN5 initiates excessive phosforilation of PI3K/Akt which contributes to ischemia-reperfusion injury aggravation. PLIN5-knockout diabetic mice might avoid excess accumulation of lipotoxic molecules such as DAG and ceramide, a common problem among diabetic patients. The built up of DAG and ceramide disrupts several signaling pathways, including PKC pathway. However, in humans, the association is not clear and the packaging of TAG into lipid droplets may be of critical importance in determining whether the accumulation of excess lipids exert a toxic effect on the myocardium. It was found that a deficiency in Plin5 reduces mitochondrial oxidative capacity in mouses. Mitochondria from hearts suffering from a Plin5 deficiency had a membrana whose fatty acyl composition was altered, and its depolarization was compromised. It was also discovered in mice that, if a whole body deficiency of Plin5 was to happen, cardiac lipid droplet formation ability would be reduced, increasing fatty acid oxidations and promoting cardiac dysfunction. This, however, could be prevented by anti-oxidative therapy.  Atherosclerosis  Deficiency in PLIN5 increases monocytes which are critical participants in the inflammation process. Because inflammation is essential to atherosclerosis, a deficiency in PLIN5 increases atherosclerosis risk.

Background  = PewDiePie vs T-Series = In mid-to-late 2018, the subscriber count of the Indian music label T-Series rapidly approached that of Swedish YouTuber and web comedian PewDiePie, who at the time was the most-subscribed user on YouTube. As a result, fans, along with celebrities and other YouTubers, showed their support for each channel by encouraging others to subscribe. During the competition, both channels gained a significant number of subscribers at a rapid rate, jumping from approximately 60 million to 100 million subscribers within a few months. The two channels surpassed each other in subscriber count on a number of occasions in February, March, and then in April 2019, when PewDiePie declared an end to the \\"subscribe to PewDiePie\\" meme and T-Series became the most-subscribed YouTube channel. = Song content = The title of the song references a viral Facebook Messenger screenshot, popularized on Reddit, in which an Indian man, in broken English, demands nude photos and calls the recipient \\"bitch lasagna\\" when his messages go unanswered..

According to security forces, Vel√°zquez was a senior member within Los √Åntrax, one of the Sinaloa Cartel's assassin squads responsible for fighting rival gangs, guarding drug shipments, and protecting the family of Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, one of Mexico's most-wanted men. He was commonly referred to by his aliases \\"El Sargento Phoenix\\" (The Phoenix Sergeant), \\"El Gato Negro\\" (The Black Cat), and \\"El Talib√°n\\" (The Taliban). Vel√°zquez was known for his long beard and shaved head. Originally a truck driver in Sinaloa, he was recruited by Los √Åntrax in 2008 and became a trusted member due to his adept combat abilities in the field. He was arrested later that year after turning himself in to allow his boss Jos√© Rodrigo Ar√©chiga Gamboa (alias \\"El Chino √Åntrax\\") to escape during a shootout. While in prison, authorities suspected that he controlled one of the prison sectors. He was released in 2014 and re-joined Los √Åntrax as its second-in-command. In 2016, he was killed in a clash with the Mexican Army in Culiac√°n. Personal life and career Ren√© Vel√°zquez Valenzuela was known by his aliases El Sargento Phoenix (The Phoenix Sergeant), El Talib√°n (The Taliban), and El Gato Negro (Black Cat). His nickname El Talib√°n was given to him for his appearance and violent personality, likely an allusion to the Taliban. He was known in the criminal underworld for the way that he executed his victims and for his long beard. In several pictures, Vel√°zquez wore a turban and posed next to a portrait of Osama bin Laden. His behavior and lifestyle were publicized through online pictures and through narcocorridos (drug ballads) about him. Several singers and music groups wrote songs detailing his personal life, including Larry Hernandez, Gerardo Ortiz, Ariel Camacho, Enigma Norte√±o, Jorge Santa Cruz, and Los Nuevos Rebeldes. Songs described Vel√°zquez as a violent person adept in using multiple types of weapons. He was also described as someone who preferred black clothing, shaving his head, and having a long beard. Prior to his involvement in organized crime, he worked as a truck driver in Sinaloa. In 2008, however, he joined a hitman squad known as Los √Åntrax and held to a senior role as one of its first members. Los √Åntrax was a group of assassins aligned to the Sinaloa Cartel, a criminal group based in Sinaloa. It was formed that year by Jos√© Rodrigo Ar√©chiga Gamboa (alias \\"El Chino √Åntrax\\") and other members to provide armed protection to the family of Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, one of Mexico's most-wanted men. The group originated after the Sinaloa Cartel and the Beltr√°n-Leyva Cartel broke their alliance in 2008. Vel√°zquez oversaw the street drug distributions in southern Culiac√°n, Sinaloa before becoming a dedicated squad member of Zambada's family security force. He was later tasked with protecting Ismael Zambada Imperial (alias \\"El Mayito Gordo\\"), Ismael Zambada Sicairos (alias \\"El Mayito Flaco\\"), and Vicente Zambada Niebla (alias \\"El Vicentillo\\"), three of El Mayo's children. When he joined Los √Åntrax, he shaved his head and grew his beard to show loyalty to El Vicentillo, his former boss and friend. El Mayito Gordo was the one who originally contacted Vel√°zquez to join Los √Åntrax. As a high- ranking member, he reported directly to Ar√©chiga Gamboa and Eliseo Imperial Castro (alias \\"El Cheyo √Åntrax\\"). Vel√°zquez gained the trust of his superiors due to his successes at leading Los √Åntrax during offensive operations, and for his violent methods and tactical strategies in the field. Los √Åntrax were responsible for fighting off rival gangsters of the Sinaloa Cartel, which included the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel and Los Zetas, as well as protecting drug shipments owned by the Sinaloa Cartel. With the arrest of El Vicentillo in 2009, the Sinaloa Cartel instructed Vel√°zquez to form a perimeter of scouts across in Culiac√°n Municipality. The purpose of this group was to report on law enforcement activities or incursions from rival criminal groups.  Arrest and release  Shortly after joining Los √Åntrax, Vel√°zquez was involved in a shootout with the Mexican Army in Culiac√°n that resulted in his arrest. According to law enforcement reports from 25 February 2008, Vel√°zquez opened fire at an Army unit, which triggered a shootout between his men and the Army in Miguel Hidalgo street. The Army responded to the aggression by shooting at the vehicle's tires and forcing Vel√°zquez's vehicle to a stop. He was arrested along with his brother Jos√© Fidel Vel√°zquez Valenzuela, Francisco Angulo Estrada, and Marco Antonio L√≥pez Armend√°riz. When the Army proceeded to apprehend him, he was in possession of multiple firearms, including an AK-47 on his lap, 40 mm grenade, and 5.7√ó28 mm pistol. His accomplices had other weapons in their possession, and the trunk of the vehicle had additional firearms and ammunition. Investigators also discovered of marijuana in the vehicle; Vel√°zquez's post-arrest medical examination confirmed he was addicted to marijuana. Vel√°zquez told law enforcement that the weapons were owned by Octavio Villarreal (alias \\"El Salchi\\"), a friend of his. Vel√°zquez said he offered to take care of the weapons for him, and that he decided to keep them in his vehicle because the Army was raiding homes in the neighborhood days prior to the incident and he was worried they would raid his home and find the weapons there. He tried to explain to law enforcement that his brother Jos√© Fidel was with him because his car would not turn on and he helped him get it to a mechanic, who he claimed was L√≥pez Armend√°riz. Vel√°zquez explained that they were arrested after he offered to drive his brother and the mechanic home. In addition, Vel√°zquez complained that when he surrendered, the Army units kept shooting at the vehicle in an attempt to kill him. Vel√°zquez claimed he had to throw himself to the ground to avoid the gunfire. He then said that the soldiers kicked and pistol-whipped him. The Army rejected Vel√°zquez's version and stated they acted in accordance to the law once Vel√°zquez attacked them. Investigators suspected Vel√°zquez fired at the Army to distract them and allow El Chino √Åntrax to escape the scene. He then reportedly turned himself in by walking towards the officers with a grenade in his hand. He was imprisoned at the Penal de Aguaruto, a low-security prison in Aguaruto, Culiac√°n, and held under federal charges. In trial, he was found guilty on 26 April 2011 of illegal possession of firearms, cartridges, and grenades, illegal possession of military-exclusive weapons, and drug possession. He was originally sentenced to 8 years, 10 months, and 3 days, but his defense appealed the decision and was able to reduce the term to 6 years, 10 months, and 6 days after the judge considered that Vel√°zquez had good conduct in prison. Vel√°zquez told the prosecution he would reintegrate himself in society again by working as a deliveryman for a local restaurant upon his release. While in prison, however, Vel√°zquez reportedly held a leadership role among the inmates, and presumably \\"controlled\\" module five, one of the prison's sectors that held Sinaloa Cartel-affiliated criminals wanted for organized crime and drug trafficking. He also enjoyed several luxuries as an inmate; he had access to social media and uploaded pictures of his lifestyle behind bars. In one of the pictures he uploaded, Vel√°zquez was seen walking along the prison yard surrounded by an entourage of inmates. In other pictures, he was smoking a marijuana joint, playing with a raccoon pet, and enjoying visits from his friends, like Roque Landeros (alias \\"Roque √Åntrax\\"), another suspected assassin of Los √Åntrax. In August 2012, Vel√°zquez's defense issued a writ of amparo to request a reduction to his sentence. His accomplices also did the same. A court in Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa, however, rejected the motion issued by Vel√°zquez but granted it for his accomplices. They were released immediately. Vel√°zquez remained in prison until 22 August 2014, when Sinaloa district judge Alba Lorenia Galaviz Ram√≠rez granted his release. His defense cited Article 84 of Mexico's Federal Penal Code, which grants inmates immediate release from prison if they have fulfilled of their sentence for intentional crimes, or of their sentence for unintentional crimes. Vel√°zquez was also required to pass a personality test showing he was ready to return to the community and not commit crimes again, have good conduct, and agree to repay the damages caused in the crimes he committed. Shootout and death At 4:00 a.m. on 30 October 2016, Vel√°zquez was killed in a clash with the Mexican Army in Las Quintas neighborhood in Culiac√°n. It occurred on Miguel Hidalgo street on the intersection with Esteban Flores and Alejandro Quijano streets. According to law enforcement reports, the Army was initially heading to Sanalona, a town in Culiac√°n Municipality, after receiving a report of armed men in the area. As they were heading there, the Army overheard gunshots near the 9th Military Zone in Culiac√°n, and re-routed their efforts back to the city. Approximately 70 soldiers in at least 15 vehicles headed to the scene; two tankettes arrived later when called as reinforcements. After arriving at Las Quintas, the Army discovered that several leaders of Los √Åntrax, including Vel√°zquez, were at a home gathering. When they noticed law enforcement's presence, several members of Los √Åntrax attempted to flee the scene in their vehicles; others tried to escape by running across the rooftops and yards of the neighborhood's houses. This caused panic among several neighbors when they overheard the gunshots. Vel√°zquez and other gunmen decided to stay back and engage in a gunfight with the Army. The Army was able to neutralize the situation and kill three suspected leaders of Los √Åntrax. Vel√°zquez was killed by gunfire; his corpse was found covered in gunshot wounds inside a red armored Toyota Tacoma. He was quickly identified by security forces due to his particular physical characteristics: his beard and shaved head. The other two men killed were Jes√∫s Rogelio Mart√≠nez Armenta (alias \\"El Chuy Piedra\\") and Gilberto Alejandro Simental Casta√±eda (alias \\"El Til√≠n\\"). Intelligence reports indicated that Los √Åntrax was in Las Quintas to provide security to El Mayito Flaco, the last of El Mayo's children that remained a fugitive. Authorities suspect that Vel√°zquez and others decided to attack the Army to allow El Mayito Flaco to escape. However, Los √Åntrax suffered three casualties, three injuries, and six arrests. The injured were Jos√© Carlos L√≥pez Alan√≠s (alias \\"El Cali\\"), Juan Carlos Aristegui Murillo (alias \\"El Toto\\"); and Jes√∫s Javier G√≥mez Armenta. The Army's service team provided first aid to the wounded and filmed them in their efforts. Authorities also arrested Abelardo Salazar (alias \\"El 50\\" and/or \\"El 90\\"), Jes√∫s Manuel Ibarra Ch√°vez (alias \\"El Ni√±√≥n\\"); and Carlos Meza Gonz√°lez (alias \\"El Carlillos\\"). = Investigation and aftermath = At the scene, the Army requested support from the Criminal Investigation Agency (AIC), a branch of the Attorney General's Office (PGR), to help gather evidences and carry out other legal procedures. They seized five assault rifles, one fragmentation grenade, and ten vehicles. Multiple bullet casing from AK-47s and other assault rifles were found at the scene. The home where the gathering took place was seized by the PGR. Investigators confirmed that they took Vel√°zquez's corpse five hours after the shootout. The injured were taken to a public hospital in Culiac√°n; the Army sent 50 troops to the hospital and supervised people accessing the building to prevent Los √Åntrax from attempting to rescue the survivors. The PGR stated that they would open an investigation against those involved in the shootout for violating Mexico's Federal Law of Firearms and Explosives. Once authorities confirmed the details surrounding the shootout, they release information of Vel√°zquez's role within Los √Åntrax. They confirmed that he was the group's second-in- command and was the acting head of the assassin operations. He was said to have worked under El Cali, who headed the group after the arrest of El Chino √Åntrax two years before. In addition, the Government of Sinaloa (es) told the press that they did not discard the possibility of a violent reaction from Los √Åntrax against the government after Vel√°zquez's death. State official Gerardo Vargas Landeros stated that municipal, state, and federal forces were working together to create a front against Los √Åntrax. Investigators highlighted that operatives like the one that resulted in Vel√°zquez's death were part of a larger military-led campaign headed by the federal government since 30 September 2016, when gunmen of the Sinaloa Cartel ambushed and killed five soldiers of the Army in Culiac√°n. Neighbors described to the press that the scene was cordoned and under surveillance for at least twelve hours, and that the Army was questioning everyone who got close to the scene. They said the Army was the last law enforcement corporation to leave the neighborhood. When asked about the shootout, some omitted giving more information, but did state that the house where Vel√°zquez was last in hosted parties often. They said they did not know who lived there. Other neighbors, who spoke on the condition of remaining anonymous, told the press that Vel√°zquez and others were not armed and were likely extrajudicially killed, in an apparent tit-for-tat for previous attacks against the Army. The press also received information from anonymous sources that the Army found out about Vel√°zquez's location from an unknown tip, which they believed suggested he was likely betrayed by someone in the Sinaloa Cartel. That person who reportedly betrayed Vel√°zquez and Los √Åntrax was alleged to be Iv√°n Archivaldo Guzm√°n Salazar, son of Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, once Mexico's most-wanted man and former associate to Zambada. Guzm√°n Salazar and Vel√°zquez's former boss El Chino √Åntrax reportedly had a fall out at a bar in Sinaloa at least two years prior to Vel√°zquez's death. The press also stated that Vel√°zquez was not at the party when the shootout broke out in Las Quintas, and that he was in fact in Guadalupe neighborhood. Radio communication conversations pointed to the possibility that Los √Åntrax requested him at the scene with reinforcements. = Funeral and burial = On 1 November 2016, authorities handed over Vel√°zquez's corpse to his family. His relatives and friends held a wake for him at a home in El Salado, a town in Culiac√°n Municipality. At around 5:00 pm, his coffin was driven on a hearse through the town's streets. The press covered the funeral in detail, and highlighted the fact that Vel√°zquez's ceremony was discreet and modest, unlike other organized crime members who host ostentatious funerals. His coffin was worth less than MXN$35,000 (close to US$1,700 in November 2016). A crowd of friends and family members walked along the hearse and played tambora as they headed to El Salado's church, where a ceremony was held. His coffin was adorned with floral arrangements containing red roses. The flowers had several notes attached to them, including one from Vel√°zquez's wife and daughters, and another from Rafael Guadalupe F√©lix N√∫√±ez (alias \\"El Changuito √Åntrax\\"), a suspected member of Los √Åntrax. Vel√°zquez was then buried at a local cemetery that same day. Several residents from El Salado claimed to have met Vel√°zquez, but omitted giving many details of his personal life. \\"We hardly saw him here. He rarely visited. But when he did, he was very kind\\", one of the residents said.

The built route mostly uses the route of the Solothurn‚ÄìHerzogenbuchsee railway, which was closed in 1992. The Solothurn‚ÄìWanzwil section is single-track and, together with the Mattstetten‚ÄìRothrist line, was the first line in Switzerland to use the European Train Control System in regular operation. The maximum speed from Solothurn to Subingen is 140 km/h and from there it is 200 km/h. The turnout at the transition to double-track can also be run at 200 km/h. The line is mainly used by the ICN services on the St. Gallen‚ÄìLausanne/Geneva route, which pass through without stopping between Olten and Solothurn. Additional colour light signalling was planned as a response to concerns that the ETCS system would not be ready for operation for the opening of the line (on 12 December 2004). Two conditions in the planning approval of the department of transport required that this fallback would be removed at the latest ten years after the start of operations. Additional work to optimise operations were planned as part of demolition work planned for late 2013 and early 2014, which were to cost CHF 7.4 million.

He is widely considered one of China's greatest violinists, known as \\"China's Menuhin\\". In 1980, he was named by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as \\"one of the world's greatest artists\\".  Biography  Sheng was born into a musical family in 1941 in Chongqing, China's temporary capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War. His father was the renowned violinist and music professor Sheng Xue (ÁõõÈõ™), and his mother was the vocalist Zhu Bing (Êú±ÂÜ∞). His parents named him \\"Zhongguo\\", the Chinese name for China, hoping for the revival of the country's fortune. He was the eldest of eleven children, nine of whom became violinists. Sheng was taught to play the violin by his father from the age of five. He made his public debut at age seven, and was recognized as a child prodigy. In 1960, he entered the Moscow Conservatory in the Soviet Union, where he studied under the preeminent violinist Leonid Kogan. Two years later, he became one of the first violinists from China to win an award at the International Tchaikovsky Competition. He returned to China in 1964, but was unable to perform during the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976). After 1978, he performed more than 100 concerts per year. When Yehudi Menuhin visited China in 1979, he performed Bach's Concerto for Two Violins with Sheng and highly praised him afterwards. Sheng subsequently gained the nickname the \\"Chinese Menuhin\\". In 1980, Sheng toured Australia and held twelve concerts in six cities. He was subsequently named by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as \\"one of the world's greatest artists\\", making him one of the first internationally famous Chinese violinists. Sheng recorded 12 albums and won the Golden Record Award in China. Sheng married the Japanese pianist Hiroko Seta (ÊøëÁî∞Ë£ïÂ≠ê) and frequently performed in Japan with his wife. After the Great Hanshin earthquake hit Kobe, Japan in 1995, he toured the disaster-stricken area and was honoured by the Japanese government as a cultural ambassador. Sheng was President of the Chinese Violin Society and taught at the Central Conservatory of Music. The violinist L√º Siqing was one of his students. On 7 September 2018, Sheng died of heart disease in Beijing, at the age of 77.

History The pub opened for business on Saint Patrick's Day, 1900. Owners James and Catherine Ward bought a former guesthouse and converted it to a pub. In 1933 the Wards' daughter, Mary, married James Brennan, who remained behind the bar until 1981 when his two daughters, Nan and Patricia, took over the business. Nan worked while Patricia cooked (or so Nan told The Irish Times shortly before her death). Part of the pub's appeal in its latter years was its lack of television, internet, and other modern conveniences (including live music), as well as its ban on swearing. Even professional musician and songwriter Phil Coulter, encouraged one evening to sing \\"The Town I Loved So Well\\", was not allowed to get away with breaking into song. In May 2015, TheJournal.ie named it on its list of \\"18 of the greatest Irish pubs that tourists (mostly) don't know about\\", stating: \\"Retreat here and find peace.\\" In 2013, Brennan's was featured in an RT√â documentary, The Irish Pub. In March 2016, a reporter with The Boston Globe wrote a feature on the pub. In 2017, the sisters appeared together in a screen advertisement for Guinness. Nan's death in her early eighties in mid-August 2017 was reported in the national media. An elder sister, Cait, was reported to still be living in Dublin, while a younger brother, Seamus, had died in 2007.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999 The second highest mountain in the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area, Whitetop Mountain and nearby Buzzard Knob are a commanding presence with a vertical elevation of 3500 feet and good views over the South Holston River at Damascus. The area is part of the Mount Rogers Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 2.4 miles southeast of Konnarock, Virginia between Va 603 on the north, and US 58 on the south and east, and Va 605. It is next to the Lewis Fork Wilderness to the east. The Appalachian Trail extends for 6.3 miles through the area, entering on the west from Lewis Fork Wilderness, climbing to Buzzard Knob and then leaving at Va 601, Beech Mountain Road, on the west. Several roads provide access to the area. VA 600 (Whitetop Road) connects US 58 with VA 603 (Little Laurel Road) while passing through Elk Garden, the point where the Appalachian Trail crosses the road. Forest Road 89 begins on VA 600 and reaches the summit of Whitetop Mountain. Forest Roads 89A, 89B, and 89C are short spur roads off FR 89 . Boundary of the Whitetop Mountain wildarea as identified by the Wilderness Society.The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 786 (Mount Rogers). and Map 318 (Mount Rogers High Country) A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land‚Äôs coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Whitetop Mountain wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Konnarock, Whitetop Mountain and Park. Natural history The fir-spruce mountain meadows on Whitetop Mountain Unusual species include the northern flying squirrel, northern saw-whet owl, purple finch, Swanson‚Äôs thrush, magnolia warbler, red crossbill, winter wren, peregrine falcon, Blue Ridge St. John‚Äôs wort, mountain rattlesnake root, mountain bittercress, Grays lilly, and three-toothed cinquefoil. There is a salamander special management area on the north side of Whitetop Mountain with the greatest known diversity of salamanders for any area on earth of comparable size. The pygmy salamander, shovelnose salamander and Weller's salamander are found here. Several stands of old growth forest have been identified on the southern side of the area. Frazer Fir and red spruce are found at the summit of Whitetop, while beech and maple are dominant below 4700 feet. Six streams in the area, Daves Branch, Big Branch, Pennington Branch, Helton Creek, Whitetop Creek , and Sturgill Branch, are recognized for their water quality.

The section to the east of Whitetop Rd, containing the drainage of Helton Creek, provides a wildlife link between the Lewis Fork Wilderness and the Whitetop Mountain area to the west. Elk Garden is at a wind gap between Mount Rogers and Whitetop Mountain. The gap, at the divide between the New River and Tennessee River drainages, was formed by a primeval stream left dry by changing erosion patterns between the two drainages. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Whitetop Mountain was not inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The mountain balds, dating back to the 1800s or earlier, are maintained by prescribed burning, with burns every two or three years depending on conditions. Most of the area is part of the 5100 acre ‚ÄúWhitetop Mountain Special Area. The special area‚Äôs management goal is to provide habitat for rare species. While not suitable for large-scale timber harvesting, some logging is allowed.

Synthesis  The first preparation of a tellurophene, tetraphenyltellurophene, was reported in 1961 by Braye et al. by reacting 1,4-dilithiotetraphenylbutadiene with tellurium tetrachloride, with the former synthesized by reaction of diphenylacetylene and lithium metal. The tellurophene, upon recrystallization from a dichloromethane/ethanol mixture, was obtained in 56% yield, and found to appear as yellow-orange crystals with a melting point of 239-239.5 ¬∞C. The same compound was obtained from 1,4-diiodotetraphenylbutadiene and lithium telluride in 82% yield. Capliertellurophene In 1966, Mack report a synthesis of an unsubstituted tellurophene through the reaction of sodium telluride with diacetylene in methanol at 20 ¬∞C. This method could be generalised to prepare 2,5-derivatives of tellurophene by selecting a suitably-substituted diacetylene precursor. The product was obtained as a pale yellow liquid with a melting and boiling point of ‚àí36 ¬∞C and 148 ¬∞C, respectively. Taticchi et al. improved upon this synthesis by using a Schlenk line to exclude oxygen and moisture from the reaction vessel, using pure butadiyne (to decrease unwanted oxidation and polymerization side reactions), and by not using a vacuum to remove the methanol as it leads to loss of the product. This improved procedure allowed the tellurophene to be isolated in 47% yield. improvedsynthesis The geometry of tellurophene was first determined in 1973 through microwave spectroscopy, and has been further refined through X-ray diffraction studies. It has been found that the Te-C bond has a length of 2.046 √Ö, which is longer than that of selenophene. Further, the C-Te-C angle has been determined to be 82¬∞, smaller than that found in selenophene, an observation attributed to the larger size of the tellurium atom. These findings are also consistent with the aromaticity of selenophene being greater than that of tellurophene; amongst its congeners, the order of decreasing aromaticity has been demonstrated to be: benzene > thiophene > selenophene > tellurophene > furan. A variety of protocols for the synthesis of tellurophenes have been developed, such as metal-catalyzed cross coupling reactions and cyclization of enynes. Some examples are shown below. In 2008, Zeni et al. reported on the copper-catalyzed cyclizations of chalcogenoenynes to obtain 3-substituted chalcogenophenes which could be further functionalized using boronic acids via palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling. 5.05Wk4 In 2016, Taylor et al. reported a synthetic route to a perfluoroaryl substituted tellurophene through Stille coupling. This compound was then subjected to further iodination and sequential Sonogashira couplings to generate a receptor for anions such as Cl‚àí and Br‚àí. Taylor Tellurophene However, metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions to synthesize 3-functionalized tellurophenes were deemed to be cumbersome as they required 3-bromo- or 3-iodo-tellurophenes, the syntheses of which could be quite complicated. An alternative method was reported by Seferos et al. in 2013, but this method was hindered by low yields and the use of expensive starting materials such as the Weinreb amide. In 2018, Han et al. reported on a one-pot procedure for the synthesis of a variety of functionalized tellurophenes without the use of transition metals. This was done by reacting substituted 1,1-dibromo-1-en-3-ynes with telluride salts (Na2Te/Na2Se) under mild conditions. The telluride salts were synthesized through an earlier protocol, wherein Te/Se was reduced with sodium borohydride in ethanol. The synthesis of the 3-functionalized tellurophenes is as follows: 330x330px It was found through mechanistic studies that the reaction was highly influenced by the polarity of the solvent. Polar solvents such as water were thought to polarize the Te-H bond, thus increasing the negative charge on Te and making it more nucleophilic. To obtain a wider scope of the reaction, the authors used dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent since DMF not only has a higher dielectric constant (and therefore, higher polarity) than water, but also was found to be able to dissolve enynes better compared to water. Using a solvent combination of DMF and t-BuOH, the authors were able to synthesize 2,4-disubstituted tellurophenes at room temperature. Synthesis of 2,4-difunctionalized tellurophenes.  Reactivity  = Anion receptor = Ethynylene-linked bistellurophene anion receptor In 2016, Taylor et al. developed a bidentate and electron-deficient bistellurophene receptor in which the tellurophenes were linked through an ethynylene bridge. As the tellurophene was thought to function as a Lewis acid in its interaction with the anion (Lewis base), 2,5-diaryltellurophenes with electron-deficient arene substitutents were synthesized. Through monitoring the change in the optical absorption spectrum upon addition of Bu4N+Cl‚àí in tetrahydrofuran (THF), it was found that 2,5-bis[(perfluoro)aryl]tellurophene was able to bind Cl‚àí with an association constant (Ka) of 310 ¬± 20 L mol‚àí1, and would also bind Br‚àí and BzO‚àí. Using computational studies, it was found that an ethynylene linkage between two tellurophenes would place the chalcogen bond donors at an appropriate distance such that the receptor could form two chalcogen bonds with the chloride. Through sequential Sonogashira coupling reactions, an ethynylene-linked bistellurophene was synthesized from 2-iodo-5-(perfluorophenyl)tellurophene. Upon addition of [Bu4N]Cl to a solution of the receptor in THF, changes to the absorption spectrum were found showing a Ka = 2290 L mol‚àí1. The significantly higher Ka was found to be in agreement with density functional theory calculations which showed that the minimum-energy geometry was one where the chloride anion was in between the tellurium atoms, with Te-Cl bond distances of 3.23 √Ö and Cl-Te-C angles of 170¬∞. One significant difference of the bidentate receptor was that there was no anion-arene stabilizing influence, and operated through purely chalcogen bonding, unlike the monodentate receptor. = Halogen photoelimination = GAMESS.alt=left In 2013, Seferos et al. reported the first example of photoreductive elimination (PE) of Cl2 and Br2 from an isoindigo-substituted tellurophene, 2,5-bis[5-(N,N‚Ä≤-dihexylisoindigo)]tellurophene. Due to the extensive œÄ-conjugation which resulted in low-energy absorption, relatively low-energy light (505 nm) was used to photoexcite the halogenated species to drive the photoreductive elimination (PE). However, the quantum yields for PE of Cl2 and Br2 were found to be 0.19% and 0.18%, respectively. Through DFT calculations, it was found that the main transition upon photoexcitation was a HOMO to LUMO+2 transition at 535 nm, with the LUMO+2 state possessing Te-X antibonding character. It was postulated that the low quantum yields were due to the fact that there were no lower energy excited states with Te-X antibonding character, and that this would limit the efficiency of the reaction. Therefore, it was thought that by changing the substituents on tellurophene such that the main transition upon photoexcitation would be HOMO to LUMO, this would significantly improve the reaction by removing efficiency losses through relaxations from states that did not possess Te-X antibonding character and did not promote Te-X bond dissociation.Photoreductive elimination of halogens using 2,5-diphenyltellurophene (PT) In 2015, Seferos et al. demonstrated that 2,5-diphenyltellurophene (PT) could participate in photoreductive elimination of fluorine, chlorine, and bromine via the two- electron Te(IV)/Te(II) photocycle, with quantum yields of up to 16.9%. This was the first report of an organotellurium compound that could perform photoreductive defluorination. The HOMO and LUMO orbitals of 2,5-diphenyltellurophene were calculated through DFT using the computational program GAMESS, and it shows that the LUMO is delocalized over the entire molecule, in agreement with the orbital pictures reported by Seferos et al. Using DFT calculations using the B3LYP functional, the authors was found that the two strongest optical transitions for PT was the HOMO to LUMO and HOMO to LUMO+1 transitions. Upon addition of halogen, however, it was found that the HOMO-LUMO energy gap decreased, with the LUMO possessing significant Te-X antibonding character. Because of this, it was postulated that by filling the œÄ* orbital with electrons, this would facilitate breaking of the Te-X bond, and hence, halogen dissociation. And indeed, upon addition of excess halogen, the peak at 342 nm corresponding to the tellurophene decreased, while a red- shifted absorption peak appeared, with the peak being more red-shifted as one moved towards the heavier halogens (PT-F2: Œªmax = 395 nm, PT-Cl2: Œªmax = 416 nm, PT-Br2: Œªmax = 433 nm). Upon irradiation of the PT-Br2 sample with a 447.5 nm lamp, it was found that the absorption spectrum of the sample rapidly changed back to that of PT in 12 seconds. This was also observed using 1H NMR spectroscopy. With F2, however, it was found that there were significant decomposition products owing to the halogen's high reactivity towards PT. This was circumvented by using water as a halogen trap instead of DMBD (2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene), since fluorine exhibits a high reactivity in water to form hydrofluoric acid. = Photooxidation = Treatment of tellurophene with hydrogen peroxideIn 2013, Seferos et al. reported the first example of a water-soluble tellurophene by attaching octaethylene glycol monomethyl ether (OEG) substituents on the para-position of the phenyl groups on 2,5-diphenyltellurophene. This was done by first synthesizing iodo-OEG, which was then added to iodophenol to form iodo-4-OEG-benzene. This was then subjected to a Sonogashira coupling, and the resulting butadiyne was treated with sodium telluride, producing the desired product. Treating the tellurophene with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) resulted in a red-shifted absorption peak at 435 nm in the UV-vis spectrum, with a peak appearing at 280 nm with a concomitant decrease of the peak at 435 nm upon treatment with excess peroxide. Through studying the reaction rate, it was found that the reaction was first order in both H2O2 and tellurophene. It was also found that the product with absorption peak at 435 nm was a dihydroxytellurophene, and the product at 280 nm was a telluroketone. The telluroketone was also found to be generated upon irradiation of a solution of the tellurophene in water with blue LED light, showing that it could be oxidized by singlet oxygen. Further, by treating a solution of the telluroxide to a -0.5 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl), it was found that its absorption peak decreased with the concurrent increase of the peak at 354 nm corresponding to the diaryltellurophene. This process could be reversed upon applying a potential of 0.8 V, thus indicating reversible oxidation. Synthesis of a water-soluble tellurophene In 2017, Seferos et al. reported the oxidative ring opening of 2,5-diphenyltellurophene (PT) under aerobic conditions, and with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). Through DFT calculations, it was found that upon oxidation of PT, the resulting Te(IV) oxide PT-O had a lower HOMO level, with the LUMO being significantly stabilized. This led to a large decrease in the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, which predicted a red shift in the maxima of the absorption spectrum. Furthermore, it was found that the electron density of the LUMO included a Te-O œÉ* orbital. This orbital picture has been further reproduced using Avogadro and GAMESS, as shown on the orbital diagram below.(a). LUMO+2, (b). LUMO+1, (c). LUMO, (d). HOMO, (e). HOMO-1 of telluroxide (PT-O) calculated with the B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d) basis set using Avogadro and GAMESS.Addition of 1 equiv of mCPBA to a solution of PT led to an immediate colour change from colourless to yellow. However, upon adding more mCPBA (4 equiv), there was a gradual decrease in the absorbance at 388 nm and a resulting absorption increase below 300 nm. As one would expect a red shift based on computational calculations, the observed blue shift suggested that upon formation of telluroxide, a different reaction pathway prevented the formation of the tellurone (PT-O2). By analyzing the reaction by 1H NMR spectroscopy, it was found that the yellow solid that had formed as the product had a downfield shift at 1123.3 ppm upon addition of mCPBA. NMR spectra and the absorption spectrum of the product in solution led to the authors attributing this product as the telluroxide. Upon addition of a large excess of mCPBA (8 equiv), the solution became bright yellow, which slowly diminished upon stirring overnight. The final product was an insoluble white solid (TeO2) and a colorless solid which was found to be (Z)-1,4-diphenylbut-2-ene1,4-dione, (Z)-ED, through a combination of mass spectrometry and 1H NMR data. This result confirmed that the tellurone is not formed even after addition of excess mCPBA.Two different pathways for the photooxidation of 2,5-diaryltellurophene using oxygen and mCPBA By using a singlet oxygen trap, 9,10-diphenylanthracene, the authors investigated the formation of singlet oxygen upon irradiation of PT. Upon irradiation of a solution containing both PT and 9,10-DPA with white light, a decrease in the absorbance at 355 nm was observed, which was indicative of 1O2 formation since 9,10-diphenylanthracene undergoes 1,4-addition with 1O2 to form the endoperoxide. A solution of PT in CDCl3 was then irradiated with 365 nm light, and it was observed that after 1 hour, complete conversion from PT to (Z)-ED had occurred with the concomitant formation of TeO2. It had been reported by Nakayama et al. that addition of 4 equiv of mCPBA to a tetraphenylselenophene solution also resulted in the formation of ene-dione compounds and SeO2. The proposed mechanism was where the first equivalent of mCPBA forms the selenoxide, with the extra three equivalents reacting with selenophene to produce a selenone diepoxide intermediate. This mechanism was consistent with the formation of telluroxide upon addition of mCPBA, and the formation of an ene-dione product upon addition of 4 equivalents of mCPBA. = Optoelectronic properties = thumb Compared to thiophenes, tellurophenes have been found to have lower optical band gaps, significantly lower LUMO levels, and higher charge carrier mobilities. In 2014, Rivard et al. reported the phosphorescence of pinacolboronate-substituted tellurophenes at room temperature, in contrast to previously reported phosphorescent materials made of expensive rare metals such as iridium and platinum. The phosphorescence was found to be aggregation- induced, as the tellurophene was non-emissive when dissolved in THF, but glowed bright green in the solid state and upon aggregation in THF/water solutions. A dibrominated Te(IV) tellurophene, B-TeBr2-B, was found to be non- emissive, indicating that the Te(II) center in B-Te-B plays an important role in phosphorescence. By replacing the pinacolboronate esters with thiophenes, there was no luminescence, indicating that both Te(II) and BPin played a cooperative role leading to emission. DFT calculations on B-Te-B revealed that the HOMO has significant contribution from the lone pair on the Te p-orbital, with the LUMO being significantly delocalized over the B-C bond. Furthermore, the energy of the triplet state (T3) was found to be degenerate with the singlet excited state (S1), which was proposed to lead to efficient singlet- triplet crossing to occur, leading to emission. This was in contrast to the sulfur and selenium analogues, where the triplet state was found to be ~1 eV higher in energy. 170x170px In 2018, Okuma et al. reported the synthesis of various 2,5-diaryltellurophenes substituted with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups through sequential ditelluride exchange and intramolecular cyclization reactions. By having both electron-donating (e.g. OMe) and electron-withdrawing (e.g. CN) groups on the tellurophene simultaneously, this resulted in a sharp reduction of the HOMO-LUMO gap. Furthermore, the authors observed significant solvatochromism, since the emission maxima shifted to longer wavelengths with increasing solvent polarity. Through DFT calculations, the authors was found that the HOMO was localized on the œÄ-orbitals of the tellurophene and the electron-donating substituent, with the LUMO localized over the œÄ*-orbitals of the tellurophene and the electron-withdrawing substituent. It was concluded that having both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents stabilizes the LUMO, with the HOMO-LUMO transitions having significant charge-transfer character, which in turn explained the solvatochromic effect. This work therefore showed how one can tune the optoelectronic properties of œÄ-conjugated tellurophenes. GAMESS.left The same molecule was subjected to DFT calculations using the computational program GAMESS, where it was found that the HOMO and LUMO orbitals were in qualitative agreement with the orbital pictures reported by Okuma, showing that the HOMO and LUMO show extensive orbital delocalization on the p-anisyl and p-cyanophenyl substituents, respectively. = Polymers = In 2016, Seferos et al. reported the synthesis of well-defined, high-molecular- weight poly-3-alkyltellurophenes (P3ATe) through catalyst transfer polymerization (CTP). CTP is an important route to synthesize polymers with a narrow molecular weight distribution and a well defined end-group, but it was found in 2013 that applying CTP-conditions for the synthesis of P3ATe led to polymers with low molecular weights, and broad polydispersities. To obtain P3ATe with a narrow polydispersity, the authors investigated the optimal conditions using kinetic studies and DFT calculations. It was found experimentally that the branched side chain played an important role on the polymerization rate and polymer quality. To mitigate this effect, monomers with various other side chains were synthesized. From this, it was found that moving the ethyl branches away from the heterocycle to the more remote 3- and 4- positions led to an improved polymerization rate and control, such that P3ATe with narrow polydispersities and high molecular weights were obtained. This improvement was attributed to the lack of steric hindrance. Furthermore, it was found that upon moving the branching point away from the heterocycle led to a red-shift in the optical absorption, which was attributed to a decrease in the degree of twisting, resulting in an increase in the conjugation between the tellurophene backbone. Synthesis of P3TeV using Stille coupling Heeney et al. reported the synthesis of the first tellurophene- vinylene copolymer through Stille coupling of 2,5-dibromo-3-dodecyltellurophene and (E)-1,2-bis(tributylstannyl)ethylene, resulting in P3TeV in 57% yield with an approximate Mn of 10 kDa and a polydispersity of 2.4. By synthesizing thiophene and selenophene analogues, it was found that there was a reduction in the optical band gap as a result of the stabilization of the LUMO, resulting in a small band gap of 1.4 eV for P3TeV. By constructing organic field effect transistors (OFETs), it was found that the selenophene polymer had the highest charge mobility, and that the tellurium analogue did not lead to an increase in mobility despite the larger size of tellurium, and possibility of closer interchain Te-Te interactions, which was attributed to the low solubility of P3TeV which resulted in poor film formation. Therefore, the authors remarked that future work entailed modifying the side-chains to increase solubility. = Frustrated Lewis Pair chemistry = Synthesis of telluroether with pendant borane In 2015, Stephan et al. reported a vinyl telluroether with a pendant borane which acted as an intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP). This was achieved by reacting tellurium acetylide with B(C6F5)3 in pentane at room temperature, affording bright orange crystals in 94% yield. It was found through 11B NMR that the product had a four-coordinate boron, which indicated a weak Te-B interaction due to the broad signal. Reacting this compound with phenylacetylene at room temperature resulted in a cis-1,2-addition across the alkyne bond, generating a zwitterionic, six-membered Te-B heterocycle, as observed using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. It was found that the coordination geometries around tellurium and boron were pseudo-trigonal pyramidal, and pseudo-tetrahedral, respectively. The C-C bond length was observed to be 1.326(4) √Ö, much longer than a C-C triple bond and closer to a C-C double bond, indicating that the compound had activated phenylacetylene through FLP chemistry. However, unlike other reported FLP compounds, it was unable to activate H2 or bind CO2, which was attributed to the fact that telluroethers are poor nucleophiles. Although the telluroether did not undergo oxidation by halogens to produce the corresponding Te(IV) dihalide compounds, it was found to react with iodine to afford a five-membered Te-B-I heterocycle. 210x210px Later, Stephan et al. reported the synthesis of various Te-B heterocycles through reaction of 1-bora-4-tellurocyclohexa-2,5-diene and two equivalents of a terminal alkyne upon heating, with loss of a diarylalkyne. X-ray crystal studies revealed that the C-C bond distances in the heterocycle were close to that of C-C double bonds, indicating delocalization within the molecule. The reaction was proceeded with high regioselectivity, with the terminal CH carbon of the alkyne attaching to the boron. Consistent with this observation, it was proposed that the Te and B act as a FLP, undergoing a [4+2] cyclcoaddition to the alkyne such that the boron adds to the CH carbon, due to the steric bulk at the boron center. In 2018, this FLP chemistry was developed further through the synthesis of 4H-1,4-telluraborine, which was found to be a useful hydroboration reagent for alkenes, ketones, and aldehydes. = Hydrogen-bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) = Chalcogen heterocycles capped with MIDA boronates Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are porous organic materials that are connected by non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds and œÄ-œÄ interactions. However, due to the relatively weak strength of hydrogen bonds, HOFs rarely exhibit permanent porosity upon removal of solvent molecules. Nonetheless, the weak interactions in HOFs allow the formation of single crystals, which are more amenable to crystallographic studies compared to COFs. Second, HOFs can be easily regenerated through dissolution and recrystallization due to their weak interactions. In 2016, Seferos et al. reported the synthesis of HOFs from chalcogen heterocycles capped with N-methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates which contain both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. MIDA-capped thiophene, selenophene, and tellurophenes were synthesized through Stille coupling. Crystal structures of DPT-MIDA and DPSe-MIDA showed the presence of C-H‚ãØO hydrogen bonding and C-H‚ãØœÄ interactions. DPTe-MIDA was not amenable to crystallographic analysis, and it was found through powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) that DPTe-MIDA had lower crystallinity compared to DPT-MIDA and DPSe-MIDA. However, the main diffraction peaks of DPTe-MIDA were similar to those of DPT-MIDA and DPSe- MIDA, suggesting that all three frameworks self-assembled into similar structures. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that acetonitrile molecules are removed at around 150 ¬∞C for DPT-MIDA and DPSe-MIDA, and 70 ¬∞C for DPTe-MIDA, with all three HOFs decomposing above 350 ¬∞C. DPT-MIDA had the highest surface area, as found by CO2 adsorption at 0 ¬∞C. Furthermore, it was found that DPT-MIDA and DPSe-MIDA adsorbed 1 mol of CO2 per mol of building block, whereas DPTe-MIDA adsorbed 0.5 mol of CO2. Furthermore, it was observed that DPTe-MIDA exhibited weak fluorescence compared to DPT-MIDA, which had a quantum yield of 6.6%.

The book eventually led to the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to Murad.  Synopsis  Part I details Murad growing up in the Yazidi village of Kocho, Sinjar District, with her mother, two older sisters and eight older brothers. Murad outlines the fallout of several incidents and disputes related to nearby Sunni villages and terrorist attacks she remembered. She then describes the August 2014 occupation of Kocho by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the subsequent Kocho massacre perpetrated by ISIS. Some had escaped to the Sinjar Mountains, and the rest were kidnapped by ISIS. Men still in Kocho refused to convert and were killed, and young women were taken as sexual slaves. Murad criticized Peshmerga troops for escaping Kocho a day before the massacre. In Part II, Murad recounts her and surrounding experiences during the Second Iraqi Civil War. Along with other women, she was transported to an institute in Solagh. She was then taken to Mosul, which had been captured by ISIS in June 2014. Yazidi women who weren't enslaved were assaulted indiscriminately. A high-ranking militant wanted to buy Murad, but she convinced a skinnier judge instead. When Murad was in Al-Hamdaniya District, she unsuccessfully attempted to escape through a window. She was subsequently raped by the guards and relocated to an ISIS checkpoint. She was imprisoned there and raped by people passing, until she was bought by someone in Mosul again. There, she successfully and easily escaped her captor, who had left the front door unlocked, and described the circumstances as miraculous. Murad narrates her escape of ISIS-held territory in Part III of the book. After wandering Mosul for almost two hours, she approached a family for help. An escape was arranged, and, using fake identities, Murad escaped with the younger son, who the family worried would join ISIS. They successfully entered Iraqi Kurdistan, but kept their fake identities so that Murad's status as a former slave would not be politically exploited. After being unable to leave Sulaymaniyah, Murad decided to tell her story to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The PUK leaked the interview, and the family who helped Murad was compromised in Mosul. Murad reunited with some of her family's members, and was waiting to learn about the rest. Her mother had been killed in Solagh, and Nadia's niece Kathrine, who had previously been turned in six times when she tried to escape, was killed in an explosive device blast which also injured Lamiya Aji Bashar. Six of Murad's brothers had been killed, and a nephew of hers had become an ISIS soldier.  Release  Murad's attorney, Amal Clooney, a Lebanese-British barrister, wrote the foreword to The Last Girl. The Last Girl was simultaneously released in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands on October 31, 2017, with rights sold in twenty other territories. According to the Associated Press, Murad noted in a statement \\"that she had lost numerous friends and family members to ISIS and hoped her story would 'influence world leaders to act. The release followed the October 2017 Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish conflict.  Critical reception  Writing for The Washington Post, Alia Malek stated that Murad \\"writes with understandable anger but also with love, flashes of humor and dignity\\". Ian Birrell wrote for The Times that Jenna Krajeski, the American journalist who co-authored the book, \\"captures Murad's tremulous voice well\\". Anna Della Subin of The New York Times praised the book as a primer on Yazidi religious beliefs. Ashutosh Bhardwaj wrote for the Indian newspaper The Financial Express that Murad's book \\"vividly details the customs and life of Yazidism\\" and that she \\"cites instances how the Yazidi stories were misinterpreted by the Sunnis who termed them 'devil worshippers. Critics focused on the fact that the Iraq conflict was still ongoing at the moment the book was published. Subin wrote that the book is \\"difficult to process\\", that it contains \\"open wounds and painful lessons\\", and that it can be \\"co-opted for any number of political agendas\\". Subin also wrote that \\"it places Murad's tragedy in the larger narrative of Iraqi history and American intervention\\". According to Subin, the book is \\"intricate in historical context\\" to avoid being manipulated by sensationalism and Islamophobia. Malek had \\"[no] doubt [that] controlling her story was part of [Murad's] motivation to tell it in this book\\". However, Malek opined that Murad harshly criticized Sunni Arabs for not standing up to ISIS and classified others as exceptions to the rule. The Evening Standard Arifa Akbar wrote that the book \\"initially defers its shock\\", being \\"a history lesson\\" about the genocide and about her family's life, and that the latter two parts of the book \\"deliver true horror, and a surreal sense of Murad's parallel existence as a sex slave in a city filled with ordinary Sunni Muslim families\\". Malek wrote: \\"She takes the time to introduce Kocho and its people before the arrival of the Islamic State. [...] So when the Islamic State strikes, we know that these are real people ‚Äî and we know that the stakes are high and the devastation is visceral.\\" Bhardwaj wrote that Murad's statement, that everyone is more interested in the sexual abuse aspect of the genocide, was \\"[perhaps] her most damning comment\\" and that \\"[her] account [reflects] the collective guilt of civilisation\\". Malek concluded her review with: \\"Nonetheless, Murad gives us a window on the atrocities that destroyed her family and nearly wiped out her vulnerable community. This is a courageous memoir that serves as an important step toward holding to account those who committed horrific crimes.\\" Birrell felt that the final segment of the book was \\"slightly rushed\\", and finished his review with: \\"It is not always easy to turn the pages as Murad descends into hell. But this is an important book by a brave woman, fresh testament to humankind‚Äôs potential for chilling and inexplicable evil. Perhaps the ultimate tragedy is that this joins a packed library of similar tomes from the past.

He's best known for his role in the so-called Altamuran Revolution (1799), advocating peace and helping the refugees, who had fled Altamura after the battle with the Sanfedisti, to be allowed in Terlizzi.  Life  Gioacchino de Gemmis was the seventh of eight children of baron Tommaso de Gemmis and Francesca Bruni, belonging to the barons of Cannavalle, Gioacchino de Gemmis was initiated into the ecclesiastical career and took sacred orders in 1770. He moved to Naples, where he graduated both in civil and canon law, was appointed in 1774 as archdeacon of the Terlizzi Cathedral and, in 1776, he was appointed as vicar of the diocese of Giovinazzo and Terlizzi. In 1783, he became archpriest of the Altamura Cathedral. He became first bishop of Altamura, and during the period 1789-1818, he was also prelate nullius, after the nomination by Pope Pius VI.bolognese-zecher, p. 12 He was also appointed as rector of the University of Altamura, established in 1748 by his predecessor Marcello Papiniano Cusano, with the purpose of promoting, together with the teachings of his friend Antonio Genovesi, the study of natural sciences with a special focus on agriculture. The university included courses ranging from economics and law to scientific subjects, with the help of the vicar Vitangelo Bisceglia, who promoted in particular the study of botany thanks to research conducted with Vincenzo Petagna and Michele Tenore. The reform of the University of Altamura promoted by de Gemmis was intended to stimulate economic development by teaching young people the new science applied to production systems. Many students from neighboring cities attended the new courses of botany, of mineralogy, of chemistry and physics, with the help of academic and mathematician Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi. De Gemmis collected many books and founded a university library. Pope Pius VI, recognizing his merits, appointed him as titular bishop of the Diocese of Listra in 1798. He also restored and embellished Altamura Cathedral, which he reconsecrated on 7 October of the same year, as written on the plaque. In 1799, during the so-called Altamuran Revolution, by risking his life, he went in person outside the city in order to talk to cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo and persuade him to let Altamuran rioters flee; nonetheless Fabrizio Ruffo denied his request. Because of this, king Ferdinand IV of Naples suspended him from his ecclesiastical functions on the charge of having favored the republican regime. During Joseph Bonaparte's rule of the Kingdom of Naples, he was re- established and, in 1808, he promised to be loyal to the new king Joachim Murat. In 1818, he was promoted bishop of the Diocese of Melfi-Rapolla-Venosa, serving with wisdom and charity. He was decorated with the knight's cross of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. He died in Terlizzi on 12 December 1822 and he was buried inside the de Gemmis family chapel. Gioacchino de Gemmis Reliquary authenticated by Gioacchino de Gemmis (second half of the 18th century, exhibited in Altamura Diocesan Museum Matroneum)  The Altamuran Revolution  Gioacchino de Gemmis distinguished himself for his authentic pastoral spirit and showed courage and unexpected mental openness. He always supported Altamuran people, first taking part in the planting ceremony of the Liberty Tree in the main square of the city (piazza del Mercato, today called piazza Duomo) and then ordering a Te Deum to be played that same evening inside Altamura Cathedral.bolognese-zecher, pag. 20 During the clashes he went to Ruffo himself, asking in vain to forgive rioters and risking his life in doing this. Unlike what happened to Raffaele Vecchioni and the two engineers Vinci and Olivieri, Gioacchino de Gemmis was allowed to return. Being him from Terlizzi, another of his greatest merits was helping the refugees who had fled Altamura on the night of 9 May 1799, after the fall of the city, to be allowed in Terlizzi.bolognese-zecher, pag. 22  Episcopal genealogy  * Cardinal Scipione Rebiba * Cardinal Giulio Antonio Santori * Cardinal Girolamo Bernerio, Ordine dei frati predicatori * Archbishop Galeazzo Sanvitale * Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi * Cardinal Luigi Caetani * Cardinal Ulderico Carpegna * Cardinal Paluzzo Paluzzi Altieri degli Albertoni * Pope Benedict XIII * Pope Benedict XIV * Pope Clement XIII * Cardinal Marcantonio Colonna * Cardinal Giacinto Sigismondo Gerdil, Chierici regolari di San Paolo * Cardinal Giulio Maria della Somaglia * Archbishop Camillo Cattaneo della Volta * Bishop Gioacchino de Gemmis See also * Altamura * Terlizzi * Altamuran Revolution * University of Altamura * Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi * Vitangelo Bisceglia  References   Bibliography  * Gaetano Valente Feudalesimo e feudatari.

Often, outsider art expresses extreme mental states, unconventional ideas, or elaborate fantasy worlds.  Biography  Born in Mexico City, as a teenager Noriega Rivero took part in various contests, and in 1971 her artistic interests led her to attend the workshops of great masters, such as Ra√∫l Anguiano, Rodolfo Nieto, Luis Velasco, Guillermo Zapfe, and Pascual Santill√°n.Guillermo Tovar de Teresa et al., Repertorio de artistas en M√©xico: artes pl√°sticas y decorativas, Mexico, Grupo Financiero Bancomer, 1996. Although at the same time she studied advertising and psychology, she recognized herself as a painter, and she devoted most of her time to pursuing this activity.  Techniques and style  She has made incursions into many techniques: engraving and wood carving; paper engraving; graphic projects for sculpture, as well as painting with charcoal, pigments with oil or water, resins, marble powder, sand and soil, all of them on canvas, wood, clay, stone and paper. She has specialized in handling graphite and charcoal on paper, as well as mixed techniques with pigments and water or oil, ground marble, sands and resins on canvas. She continuously renews herself, having developed a personal avant-garde style with some influence from abstract expressionism and surrealism. Outsider art is conventionally considered as one of the trends of informalism, but in this painter it is fused with neo-figurative art, an expressionist revival in modern form of figurative art. The term \\"neo- figurative\\" emerged in the 1960s in Mexico and Spain to represent a new form of figurative art.Hal Foster, The Return of the Real: the Avant-Garde at the End of the Century, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1996, 1999). The greatest exponent of outsider art, the French Jean Dubuffet, influenced by Hans Prinzhorn's book Artistry of the Mentally Ill,Hans Prinzhorn, Artistry of the Mentally Ill, New York, Springer-Verlag, 1972 (translation from the original work in German, Bildnerei der Geisteskranken, Berlin, Julius Springer, 1922). coined the term art brut, which may be approximately translated as \\"art in the rough\\", to refer to the art made by non-professionals, who do not follow aesthetic rules, such as social misfits, children, mentally troubled people, prisoners, etc.Jean Dubuffet, \\"Art Brut in Preference to the Cultural Arts\\", translation from French by Allen S. Weiss and Paul Foss, in Art Brut: Madness and Marginalia, Allen S. Weiss (ed.), special issue of Art & Text, No. 27, 1988, p. 33. Dubuffet gathered a collection of this kind of paintings, which includes works by the Swiss Alo√Øse Corbaz, the Spanish Alfredo Pirucha and the Swiss Adolf W√∂lfli.Serge Fauchereau (ed.), En torno al art brut, translation by In√©s B√©rtolo, Madrid, Ediciones Arte y Est√©tica, C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes, 2007. Dubuffet aspired to create an art free from intellectual worries, in which elementary, childish and often cruel figures prevail.  Features  Some traits of Noriega's work in line with outsider art are: * Rough, spontaneous, grotesque and thoughtless quality, akin to the unconscious. * Images that reflect her inner world. * Use of onirist-like devices. * Rejection of the traditional approaches to composition (coherence, organization, homogeneity, etc.). * Great freedom in drawing and palette (earthy, pale or bright colors prevail depending on the mood of each painting). * Use of very different materials mixed with the paint (plaster, sand, cement, gravel), which add texture and relief. * Expressive effects through richly material, textured effects. * Recurring motifs developed during extended periods of time (flower vases, the human body, musical instruments, hearts, animals).Andr√© Breton, \\"El arte de los locos, la llave de los campos\\", chapter 5 of Antolog√≠a (1913-1966), twelfth edition, selection and prologue by Marguerite Bonnet, translated by Tom√°s Segovia, Mexico, Siglo XXI, 2004.

The company has two segments - the desktop segment and the data center segment. Asetek was founded in 1997 and is based in Aalborg, Denmark. The company is known for supplying desktop water coolers for companies like Corsair and NZXT. It‚Äôs been credited for \\"taking liquid cooling mainstream\\".  History  Asetek was first founded by Andr√© Eriksen in 1997, with the discovery that CPUs perform better at sub-zero temperature. A year into its existence, Asetek's network of VapoChill re-sellers grew to over 35. In 2000, Asetek received an award from the Danish Ministry of Trade and Industry for being Denmark's most innovative company that year. The company was also officially incorporated on the same year. In 2001 the Asetek released the first 2 GHz personal computer and started a business partnership with Asus. In 2002, the new generation VapoChill was released. In 2003, Asetek released the WaterChill brand of liquid coolers. In 2005, they released the first 12 volt pump system. = Gen 1/2 = In 2007, Asetek announced its first OEM design to be used by HPs Blackbird Gaming PC. In 2008 Acer used Asetek to cool its new Predator Gaming PC's. In 2009, Dell made liquid cooling a standard feature on its Alienware computers. = Gen 3 = The gen 3 pump was released in 2010. It offered a reduced size when compared to their gen 2 but without compromising performance. The reduced height aimed to facilitate the cooling of GPUs such as the GTX 580 from PNY Technologies. These pumps are used by Corsair, PNY and Antec. They can be identified by the exposed motor portion on the cap. = Gen 4 = The gen 4 pump platform was released in 2012. It brought advances in the liquid flow and thermal performance compared to gen 3. The exposed section of the motor was removed from the top of the pump. It was the most used platform in the companies history, being used by Corsair, NZXT, Thermaltake, Dell, HP, Intel and other companies. = Gen 5 = The gen 5 pump was released in 2015. It was focused on reducing noise and increasing thermal performance. It achieved this through material and chamber optimizations. Gen 5 also brought a more efficient motor. The side inlets/outlets of the previous generations were replaced with a vertical inlet and outlet. = Gen 6 = The Corsair H115i liquid cooler uses the Asetek 6 gen pump First revealed at Computex by Corsair in 2017 and released in 2018 by Corsair with the release of the H150i and the H115i. As of yet Asus, Corsair and Gigabyte have released gen 6 Asetek pumps. Gen 6 pumps go back to the side-mounted inlet and outlet like gen 4 pumps. They also have a smaller cold- plate, the first change to the cold-plate in years.  Products  Asetek manufactures and designs many OEM liquid cooling pumps for computers, both for data centers and desktop computers. The water coolers are used to cool Central processing units (CPUs) and Graphics processing units (GPUs). = CPU coolers = * 510LC: Mainstream liquid CPU cooler, competitive pricing, competes with mid-range air coolers. * 545LC: 92mm sized designed for smaller cases and MicroATX. * 550LC: Higher end with better performance then the 510LC. * 570LC: Higher end with dual push-pull fan support. * 570LX: Supports 2 120mm fans, extra thickness. * 570XLF: Supports 2 120mm fans, standard thickness. * 591LX: 27mm thin, fits 3 adjacent 120mm fans. = GPU and mixed coolers = *550QC: Delivers the same cooling as the 550LC, but with easier expansion options to collect with the 740QC for GPU cooling. *740QC: Nvidia GPU with quick connect to use with 550LC. *740GN: GPU liquid cooler for Nvidia 600 and 700 series GPUs.  Patents and lawsuits  The company is very well known for its patents. It holds patents to many OEM liquid cooling solutions and many liquid cooling pumps. The company also holds the patent to having the pump inside the water block (the part that goes over the CPU or GPU). Many companies have also released models of liquid cooling AIO (all-in-ones) with this design. As such, Asetek has taken many companies to court on such charges. Asetek has sued Cooler Master, Corsair and CoolIt over these charges. All three times they won the lawsuits.  Partners  Asetek has contracts with many companies to make water coolers.

History Location: The factory and warehouse buildings as well as the residential block were commissioned by a window and door builder. It set up their production there. After this company went bankrupt, the property was taken over by a tobacco company. This then produced cigarettes until the production was closed due to falling demand. Terxo was then set up in these premises. A portion of the production space has been sub-leased to an adhesive company, which is also a direct customer of bottles and closures that Terxo manufactures. A development department of the locking system manufacturer Kaba Group is accommodated in the premises. Company Werner Dubach founded the company Createch AG in N√ºrensdorf, which manufactures various bottles and closures for the medical, cosmetics and food sector in the injection-blow, injection-blown and injection-molding process. It was planned to build a company building consisting of several parts, with office, production and storage facilities. On the one hand, granting problems, which led to massive changes in the construction project, led to financial problems. In addition, copyright complaints were filed for the production of food-grade food packaging for Danone yoghurts and quarks by the toy manufacturer Lego. This led to the bankruptcy of the company Createch. The main building was not completely finished and a part is still in the shell and is used as a warehouse. The Createch was passed on by the Credit Suisse until the Dutch Medisize Group took over the company. The Createch was then renamed to Medisize AG Switzerland. In the meantime Werner Dubach had founded Terxo with some former Createch employees and the financial commitment of Markus Schellenberg in Wetzikon. Werner Dubach had designed and patented some closures. These are partly still produced today by the Medisize Schweiz AG, the Terxo and the German Terxo partner company Bericap. Werner Dubach retired a few years ago, the company Terxo is now under the leadership of Markus J. Schellenberg. Products Terxo manufactures, in particular, closures for food packaging by means of injection molding machines and injection blow- molding machines as well as assembly machines for further processing, but also parts for medical technology as well as for adhesives, bottles for adhesives and bottles for milk drinks. The Terxocut screw caps for Tetra Pak's are also co-produced by the German partner company and shareholder (30% of Terxo shares) Bericap under license worldwide. The Actifit bottles (Polyethylene) for the Emmi AG milk processor, which Terxo manufactures, is a major competitive pressure. This is because the company Medisize manufactures these bottles also for Emmi. In addition, the injection molding and injection blow molding tool manufacturer Ganahl, who has produced the corresponding tools for Terxo and Medisize, is also producing such bottles.

The Medisize Switzerland was original created as Createch AG.  History  Medisize is a Stock company at N√ºrnsdorf in Switzerland. Management: J√ºrg Wiedler. Werner Dubach founded the company Createch in N√ºrensdorf, which produced various bottles and closures for the medical, cosmetics and food sector in the injection blow, injection blow stretching molding and injection molding process. It was planned to build a building consisting of several parts, with office, production and storage space. On the one hand, granting problems, which led to massive changes in the construction project, led to financial problems. In addition, copyright complaints were filed for the production of food-grade food packaging for Danone yoghurts and quarks by the toy manufacturer Lego. This leads to the bankruptcy of the company Createch and the main building was not completely finished. A part is still in the shell and is used as a warehouse. The Createch was passed on by the Credit Suisse Bank until the Dutch Medisize Group took over the company. The Createch was then renamed to Medisize Switzerland AG. In the meantime Werner Dubach had founded the company Terxo AG Switzerland in Wetzikon with some former Createch employees and the financial commitment of Markus Schellenberg. Werner Dubach had designed and patented a number of closures, some of which are still produced today by Medisize, Terxo and the German Terxo partner company Bericap. Werner Dubach retired some years ago. Products Branch of industry: Plastic industry and packaging industry, food and medical packaging Medisize Switzerland produces mainly closures for food packaging and cosmetics by means of injection molding machines and injection blowmachines, injection stretch blow molding machines as well as with assembly machines for further processing, but primarily packaging for medical products such as, for example, Eyedrops as well as bottles for drinks. The Actifit bottles (polyethylene) for the milk processor Emmi, which produces medisize, have a great competitive pressure. This is because the company Terxo manufactures these bottles for Emmi too. In addition, the injection molding and injection blow molding machine manufacturer Ganahl, who has produced the corresponding tools for Terxo and Medisize, also manufactures such bottles by themselves. This means that there are three companies in the canton of Zurich, which all supply the same customer with the same product. Equipment Medisize uses injection molding machines of Japanese and German origin. Three Italian machines are available for the injection blow-molding machines, but the majority of injection-molding machines are Jomar machines with vertical plasticizing cylinders, which come from the US. Medisize Switzerland is the first production company to use a fully electric injection blow molding machine. This was developed by a German toolmaking company.

It was designed by Pierce Collits and built in 1823. It is also known as Collitts Inn and Golden Fleece Inn. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Pierce Collits was transported to New South Wales in 1801. His wife, Mary, accompanied him on the Minerva as a free woman, and in 1803 she received a grant of on the Castlereagh flood-plain. Macquarie pardoned Pierce in 1810, he became a substantial grazier and held various government positions. After obtaining an additional at Prospect, the Collits family was allowed to settle over the Blue Mountains in 1821 with 145 head of cattle, but Pierce remained as Chief constable on the Nepean until 1823. In 1823 both Lawson's Long Alley down from Mount York, by-passing Coxs Road of 1812, and Bells Line of Road descending midway along Darling Causeway were created. Collits built an inn near the convergence of these roads in the same year, 1823: the inn is shown on Surveyor Hoddle's 1823 map of Bells Line. Until Mitchell opened Victoria Pass in 1832, Collits Inn, the Golden Fleece, was the premier hostelry on the old western road. It was also a leading place for stock mustering and stock sales, so Collits had substantial holding paddocks on the portion 27 (where the Inn was sited) and on the adjacent of portion 29 to the south (where the cemetery was established). By 1828 Collits was running 360 cattle and 300 sheep of his own. After a decade of success, with visits from Governors in 1829 and 1832 and the post office franchise in 1830, the Golden Fleece declined after 1834 and Collits opened new inns first in Little Hartley, then in Hartley. The Hartley Vale property then became primarily a farm retained by Pierce Collits until his death in 1848. It passed from the Collits family in the 1860s when the pioneer family of Sodwalls, the Whalans, bought it and retained it as a private house until at least the 1880s. In 1911 Job Commens, son of John Stephen Commens of Duddawarra in Kanimbla and his wife Grace born a Dalziell of Rosevale also in Kanimbla, bought the farm and renamed it Mount York Farm. Job and Grace, with their son Alan, farmed there until 1920, when the farm was leased for three years because of Grace Commens' fourth pregnancy late in life. The Commens sold Mount York when the lease expired in 1923. In 1946 a Croatian immigrant, S Pilarcik, bought the property, joined by his wife in 1965. In 1986 a Permanent Conservation Order (no. 455) under the NSW Heritage Act was placed on the property with a defined curtilage. In 1998 Mrs Pilarcik sold the property to Mr and Mrs Stewart, whose family already held adjacent property.

Description  Collits' Inn is a single story Old Colonial Georgian building, of weatherboard and brick nog construction. The Collits Inn group consists of the Inn, the Stables, the Barn, the Outbuilding, the Woolshed, the Pit toilet and the External Septic Toilet lying on of Portion 27 in the County of Cook. The Inn is an excellent example of a wayside Inn from the Colonial period with many of the characteristics of the old Georgian style, including its pleasant human scale, symmetrical facade, stone flagged verandah below a broken-back hipped roof, small pane sash windows and simple chimneys. The Inn has remnant gardens in its vicinity and is set behind a screen of substantial pine trees on the road. = Condition = As at 27 November 2001, the initial archaeological assessment report on the Collit's Inn complex had predicted the potential survival of substantial and significant archaeological evidence relevant to all prior occupation phases. The completion of the work described in this report confirmed the high archaeological potential of the area within and around Collit's Inn. As a sample transect across the site and through the main Inn building the trenches overall confirmed th epredicted intactness of the archaeological resources of the site. The nature of the historic occupation of the site and of the documentary evidence, means that additional material or deposits, particularly informally established features such as rubbish dumps, may be expected to be present elsewhere in or around the Inn. For this reason unnecessary disturbance of the deposits around or within the Inn itself must not occur within any other future projects.Excerpts of \\"Archaeological Potential\\", in Lavelle, 2002, 13. The Inn is in a generally intact condition with some alterations and additions to the exterior and interior. Within the site around the Inn there is likely to be evidence of a number of early structure shown on maps in the 1830s. = Further information = Draft Landscape Conservation Management Principles:Beaver, 2000, 3. *A key objective is to conserve the landscape setting of Collit's Inn as a simple and unpretentious rural cottage garden, stocked with 19th century plant varieties and surrounded by paddocks, apple orchards and remnant natural areas; Existing trees, shrubs and other plants within the curtilage of the Inn shall be conserved in accordance with their relative significance; New garden plantings should predominantly be of species and varieties known to have been grown in the local area during the mid-19th century (refer to list).Beaver, 2000, 3.  Heritage listing  As at 10 August 2007, Collits' Inn and its group of surviving buildings is of national significance for its rare historical, aesthetic, technical and social values. It was built by Pierce Collits and his family and was initially known as the Golden Fleece. It was the first wayside inn built west of the Blue Mountains and was sited to service people and stock using the first roads descending Mount York. Pierce Collits had held various NSW Government positions in the early 1800s and also became a significant early grazier west of the mountains. The inn was well known at the time and operated until Mitchell's construction of Victoria Pass in 1832. The buildings and much of the surrounding property then remained in direct Collits ownership until 1875 as Mount York Farm. The family were later involved in a number of other local inns in the Hartley area. Collits' Inn has an important range of strong historical associations such as those with early Governors of NSW, early surveyors, possible early military connections, a focal point for all roads crossing the mountains for many years and the first country post office. The adjacent cemetery has direct associations with the first settlement west of the Blue Mountains. Aesthetically the group of buildings are remarkably well preserved and the Inn, clad in weatherboard, is an excellent example of a wayside inn from the colonial period with many of the characteristics of the Old Colonial Georgian style including its pleasant human scale, symmetrical facade, stone flagged verandah below a broken backed hipped roof, small paned sash windows and simple chimneys. The Inn has remnant gardens and orchards in its vicinity and is set behind a screen of substantial Monterey pines on the road. The setting in a remote site in the Vale of Clywdd below a spur of the Blue Mountains and its visual relationship to Mount York also contributes to this aesthetic significance. The range of intact early construction materials and evidence of early building techniques are of high technical significance. The brick nog construction of the earliest sections of the inn are extremely rare in NSW. Other important issues which could provide opportunities for further research are the range of early building materials and techniques such as the use of dry pressed bricks, local sandstone, joinery and other timberwork including the rough timber construction for the surviving outbuildings such as the barn. The interiors are relatively simple in form and finish but are relatively intact retaining a high degree of original fabric. The archaeological potential of the site is high. The Inn has had social importance to a number of different groups over the years. Initially it was intrinsically linked with the lives of all early NSW travellers and settlers west of the mountains providing an important service to the region and a rare social meeting place. During the years while operating as a substantial farm it was important to the Hartley community possibly as a symbol of the first grazing and inn keeping family to settle in the region. While in the years since the turn of the (20th) century and particularly since the unique Australian operetta called \\"Collits\\" Inn' was produced in 1934, a broader community attachment has developed by those with a specific academic interest in the inn to those with a romantic image of its early history, but also including those with a general interest in Australian history and the part that Collits' Inn played. The comments in the visitors books since the 1930s testify to this community value. Also the descendants of the Collits family are now substantial in number, live throughout Australia and are a cohesive group who regard the Inn and its unique history as pivotal to the past, present and future lives of their families..Stewart, with Aitken, 1999, 57. The Collits' Inn complex contains an historical archaeological resource of local, state and national heritage significance. The Inn was one of the earliest historic sites to be established west of the Blue Mountains. It exemplifies the development of the early Western Road and reflects the first phase of the great westward expansion of the colony during the early decades of the 19th century after the first crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813. The Inn has strong associations with significant historical figures including Governors (Darling, Bourke), inn keepers (Pierce Collits and family), surveyors or road builders and early travellers (Dumaresq). The main Inn and surrounding site has considerable historical archaeological value and research potential to demonstrate the general character of its types of occupation from the early 19th century onwards. In themselves colonial period inns are a significant class of buildings which have been little studied archaeologically. Although a number of city hotels have been archaeologically excavated in recent years that is not the case for roadside inns, especially those in rural and remote locations. There is strong scientific research potential inherent to this site because substantial sections of its archaeological deposits remain intact. Examination of the material culture of the Inn would be possible as would research questions about the types of treatment given to members of different social classes, dependence on supplies from Sydney versus local products, indeed any questions relevant to the organisation and running of such an early Inn..Lavelle, 2002, 13. Collits' Inn was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Collits Inn and its group of surviving buildings is of National Significance for its rare historical, aesthetic, technical and social values. It was built in c 1823 by Pierce Collits and his family and was initially also known as the Golden Fleece. It was the first wayside inn built west of the Blue Mountains and was sited to service people and stock using the first roads descending Mount York. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Collits Inn has an important range of strong historical associations such as those with early Governors of NSW, early surveyors, possible early military connections, a focal point for all roads crossing the mountains for many years and the first country post office. The adjacent cemetery has direct connections with the Collits family and the Inn is historically important in itself for its associations with first settlement west of the Blue Mountains. Its importance declined when Mitchells Road was built, so that its period of greatest significance was short. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The setting at a remote site in the Vale of Clwydd below a spur of the Blue Mountains and its visual relationship to Mount York also contributes to this aesthetic significance. The group of buildings are remarkably well preserved, and the Inn is an excellent example of a wayside Inn from the Colonial period with many of the characteristics of the old Georgian style. The buildings as a group together with their early gardens, orchards, vegetable gardens and pond constitute a cohesive early farm development. The building group demonstrates a wide range of early and vernacular materials and techniques. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item has scientific significance and is assessed as rare on a state basis. While in the years since the turn of the century, a broader community attachment has developed by those with a specific academic interest in the Inn to those with a general interest in early Australian history and the part that Collits' Inn played. The comments in the visitors book since the 1930s are of value to all the community. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as rare on a state basis. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. This item is assessed as representative on a state basis.

The dominant style of Maldivian cinema is melodramatic cinema, which developed since 1990s and characterizes most films to this day. Cinema was introduced in Maldives in 1979. Linguistically, Maldivian films tend to use Dhivehi language, intelligible to native speakers, while modern Maldivian films also increasingly incorporate English. During the 1990s, many Maldivian films were inspired by Bollywood, with some of the films being unofficial remakes of those films. The industry continued to grow, and some successful Maldivian films were produced. History =1979‚Äì2009: Early releases= In the late 1979, a trend of screening Hindi films at the limited cinemas arises. A group of Maldivians came up with the idea of making a regional film for the Maldivian audience though several obstacles emerged including incapability to secure finance and equipment. However, they were successful to acquire a small camera which resulted in the first Maldivian song \\"Noorey Vidhee Moonun Roashan Ujaala\\" featuring Hassan Afeef and Rahma. Shot at Sultan Park, the song gets leaked prior its official release hence the project of making a film was dismissed. During the time, an independent organization called Bronze Movie Society was introduced to encourage film making. After three years, the first Maldivian film was release under the helm of then Minister of Health, Musthafa Hussain. Titled Thin Fiyavalhu (1982), the film stars Hassan Afeef in lead role and tells a story of a romantic relationship between a girl who comes to Male' from an island and a boy who lives in the house she resides in Male'. The film was accepted and appreciated by the audience resulting in the second release Copy. During the time, Television Maldives was working on another film titled Orchid: Eynage Maa, giving \\"the required push\\" for those interested in film-making. In the 1980s and 1990s most of the Maldivian feature films were influenced in film-making, style and presentation by Bollywood movies. Though few off-track movies of different genres were made, majority of them are strictly influenced by Bollywood, awakening a necessity of a realism and naturalism cinema movement. In 1994, Mohamed Niyaz released his only directed feature film Dheriyaa which requisites the style of film- making the industry follows. The same year, Gaumee Film Awards was inaugurated to honour both artistic and technical excellence of professionals in the Maldivian film industry. Dheriyaa was bestowed with 8 Gaumee Film Awards. 1996 witnessed the release of the most successful Maldivian film, Easa Shareef's horror film Fathis Handhuvaru. Successful actors at the time included Reeko Moosa Manik, Ali Shameel, Hassan Afeef, Moosa Zakariyya, Hussain Sobah while successful actresses included Aishath Shirani, Mariyam Nisha, Jamsheedha Ahmed and Waleedha Waleedh. During the 2000s, a trend of remaking Bollywood films was followed. Hussain Adil's Hiyy Halaaku (1999) was an unofficial remake of Karan Johar's romantic drama film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) starring Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Rani Mukerji in the lead role while Aishath Ali Manik followed the same trend while making Assad Shareef, Sheela Najeeb, Ali Seezan and Niuma Mohamed starrer Hiiy Edhenee (2001) was copied from Dharmesh Darshan's romantic film Dhadkan (2000) starring Akshay Kumar, Suniel Shetty and Shilpa Shetty. Similarly, Aslam Rasheed's romantic thriller Dheevaanaa (2001) was an unofficial remake of Ram Gopal Varma's romantic thriller Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya released in the same year, while Easa Shareef's horror film Ginihila (2003) is drawn from Vikram Bhatt's Raaz (2002). The decade also saw the trend of established directors like Fathimath Nahula and Abdul Faththaah making melodrama entertainers like Naaummeedhu (2001), Loabi Nuvevununama (2002), Aan... Aharenves Loabivin (2003), Kalaayaanulaa (2003), Zuleykha (2005), Vehey Vaarey Therein (2005) and Yoosuf (2008). In 2005, the first Maldivian romantic disaster film was released, Abdul Faththaah's Hureemey Inthizaarugaa which was heavily relied on the effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on the Maldives. Majority of the films released during the decade was directed by Amjad Ibrahim. These films were often not the subject of critical acclaim. On the other hand, Moomin Fuad and Ali Shifau have been credited for redefining the Maldivian cinema with their own distinct brand of socially conscious cinema with art film like Heylaa (2006) and Happy Birthday (2009). These films focused on realistic parallel cinema and include believable narratives and strong messages, earning critical acclaim though they were commercial failures. Successful actors at the time included Yoosuf Shafeeu, Ali Seezan and Mohamed Manik while successful actresses included Niuma Mohamed and Sheela Najeeb. =2010‚Äìpresent: International recognition= Majority of the films released in 2010s were based on themes; romance, drama and horror. In 2010, some family drama films dealt with social issues; Yoosuf Shafeeu‚Äôs Veeraana revolves around a child being sexually abused by a pedophilia while Niuma Mohamed‚Äôs debut direction, Niuma showed the titular character being sexually assaulted by her father and brother. Also, Shafeeu-directed Heyonuvaane revolves around a male who is victimised of domestic abuse. It also marks the first film released in theaters along with English subtitles. The following year, Moomin Fuad's crime tragedy drama film Loodhifa was released attracting widespread critical acclaim though it fails to leave much impact financially. Prior to release, the film is marketed to be one of the most bold and risky movies released in the industry. The year introduced a war drama film, Ali Seezan's Wathan, where the genre was later experimented in 2016 by Ash'har Waheed in Haadharu. In 2010, ten Maldivian feature films were released while in 2011 the number was increased to thirteen. 2012, witnessed a big drop in film releases, due to the only theatre, Olympus Cinema, being closed for upgrading. The following year, Ali Shifau-directed horror film Fathis Handhuvaruge Feshun 3D (2013) was released which marks the first 3D release for a Maldivian film and the first prequel made in the industry. It was followed by Ravee Farooq's experimental suspense thriller Ingili (2013) which initiated the recognition of Maldivian cinema in international platforms. The regional success was recommenced with Ali Seezan's psychological thriller Insaana (2014) and Farooq's Vishka (2017). The decade also saw the rise of a new generation of popular actors like Mohamed Jumayyil, Ravee Farooq and Ahmed Azmeel while popular actresses include Aishath Rishmy, Mariyam Majudha, Fathimath Fareela and Maleeha Waheed. Challenges for Maldivian Cinema Raajje.mv identifies six major challenges that have influenced the progress of Maldivian popular cinema: * There are only a small amount of actors and actresses, which could be a factor that the industry is unable to successfully gain much improvement over the recent years even with much hard work and dedication. * Most of the Maldivian films are set in one location due to failure to attain what they seek. * Filmmakers are not provided with opportunities to submit their productions to other international festivals. * Lack of budget and resources to finance the films. * Lack of government support. Genre conventions Maldivian films are mostly melodramatic and horror films. They frequently employ formulaic ingredients such as star- crossed lovers, enraged parents, love triangles, cunning in-laws, sacrifice, dramatic reversals of fortune, and convenient coincidences. Some films include elements of musicals and are expected to contain catchy music in the form of song-and-dance numbers woven into the script. A film's success often depends on the quality of such musical numbers. A film's music is often released before the movie to attract the audience. However, there are few Maldivian films with more artistic aims and more sophisticated stories. They often lost out at the box office to movies with more mass appeal. Awards The Gaumee Film Awards ceremony is one of the most prominent film events given for Maldivian films. Presented by National Centre for the Arts to honour both artistic and technical excellence of professionals in the Maldivian film industry, it is the oldest film events in Maldives. The 1st Gaumee Film Awards ceremony was held in 1994 and films released prior to this year was judged. Till the 8th Gaumee Film Awards ceremony, films released on a span of two or more years were judged for each ceremony. Notable awards ceremonies for Maldivian films, held within Maldives are: * Gaumee Film Awards ‚Äì since 1994 * Maldives Film Awards ‚Äì 2011-2013 Most of these award ceremonies are lavishly staged spectacles, featuring singing, dancing, and numerous celebrities.

It was published in Shogakukan's Big Comic Original from December 2002 to September 2006. After a seven-year hiatus, it was followed by a sequel Shin Kurosawa: Saiky≈ç Densetsu, and ran from May 2013 to March 2020. A spin- off focused on the first series' secondary character Sh≈´hei Nakane, titled Saitsuyo Densetsu Nakane, started in Yawaraka Spirits online magazine in December 2017. Plot The story depicts the sorrow and hardships of Kurosawa, a 44-year-old construction worker. In December 2002, when no one celebrates his birthday, he suddenly realizes that his life is too unsatisfactory, and begins to feel anxious. Thus, he desires to be respected and takes the opportunity to change his life. After a series of twists and turns, Kurosawa wins the trust of his younger coworkers, but new problems keep following him one after another, and unexpectedly, he has to go through all sorts of carnage to earn his title of \\"the strongest.\\" Characters =Anahira Construction= ; : An unmarried veteran blue-collar worker who has been employed at Anahira Construction for 26 years since graduating high school. Although he is assigned as a site foreman on paper, the reality is that while his colleagues leave the site due to promotion or restructuring, he can't move up, and even so, he can't quit, so he is left alone with a low monthly salary. Since he has no special qualifications and is not well-liked (especially at the beginning of his career), he is sometimes treated coldly, such as being removed from work under the guise of being a traffic control helper. He is also a large man, over , although his middle-aged weight makes him significantly unattractive to look at. Because of his job, he is proud of his physical strength, and as he admits, he is not very educated or knowledgeable, but is very strong and often uses his wits to overcome a difficult situation. Despite being slightly cowardly, he has the guts to put his own life on the line if his pride is at stake. Generally clumsy in his interpersonal relationships, he tries to break the ice with the people around him or, conversely, tries to get rid of his enemies. In order to achieve this goal, he often engages in outlandish ideas and behaviors, which, coupled with his bad luck, leads to misunderstandings from the people around him, and has even gotten him in trouble with the police. From the middle of the story, he shows his strong personality and is called \\"a natural monument\\" and \\"a dinosaur on the verge of extinction\\" by Sakaguchi. : In Shin Kurosawa, he has been in a coma for eight years after his last battle, but gradually wakes up and undergoes rehabilitation, slowly recovering from his condition. ; : Kurosawa's younger coworker thought to be around his 20s, with his words and actions suggesting that he was a former delinquent. Unlike Ono, he has a cool personality and doesn't show that side of him, but he has a rebellious spirit and doesn't come to accept people as quickly. At one point in the early part of the story, he disliked Kurosawa partly because of a misunderstanding, but one day, when Kurosawa struggled with his work, he and his colleagues, Asai, Arita, and Nakanishi, formed a friendship with Kurosawa. He is often involved in Kurosawa's schemes, and he is often reluctantly forced to cooperate, but by the end of the story, he rather willingly cooperates with him. He has an older sister who is a stylist. In Shin Kurosawa, he gets married and has a child. ; : Kurosawa's younger coworker, he is immature in both his looks and personality. His hobby is video games and he likes to sing karaoke of Sh≈çgo Hamada's songs. It is later revealed he was a victim of bullying in the past, and shows a great deal of concern towards Kurosawa when he is attacked by middle schoolers. Along with Sakaguchi, he often watches over Kurosawa. ; : Kurosawa's younger coworker. He gets along well with Sakaguchi. His zodiac sign is Gemini. ; : Kurosawa's younger coworker. He gets along well with Sakaguchi. For unexplained reasons, he does not make an appearance for the last battle of the story. ; : Kurosawa's younger coworker. He has a number of qualifications and is very good at giving precise instructions in actual work. In addition, he voluntarily performs heavy work, and his humble nature, which he does not take pride in, makes him highly popular. He also makes some pretty bold decisions, such as allowing four people to leave early at once. At the beginning of the series, he was Kurosawa's rival, but after Kurosawa's battle scenes became more frequent, his appearances in the series became less so. He is 28 years old and has a beautiful wife and kids. ; : The president of Anahira Construction, where Kurosawa works. At first glance, he appears to be a mild-mannered old man, but he is also a shrewd veteran manager who gently persuades Kurosawa, who was temporarily isolated at work, to leave the field. But in the second half of the story, every time Kurosawa is detained by the cops, he is often shaken around, including being woken up late at night by a phone call from the police. His hobby is cycling. ; : One of the workers sent to the Anahira construction site. He tends to follow the rumors about Kurosawa the most. While making a big deal out of his own misunderstandings, he endangers Kurosawa's position by buttering him up with fear, talking behind his back and looking for opportunities to counterattack. ; : A newbie worker who works with Anahira Construction. In the countryside, he was a proud fighter and delinquent gang leader, and even now he is a headstrong man with a delinquent temperament who is obsessed with being the strongest in the field. =Fujisaki 2nd Middle School= ; : A juvenile delinquent. She and her group of three hooligans first initiate the assault on Kurosawa. ; : A junior high school student who stands at about tall. He specializes in boxing. After losing the fight with Kurosawa, he sincerely respects him, calling him \\"bro\\" and adoring him. At first glance, he appears to be a complete misfit, but he is actually a returnee who lived in England for three years and speaks English fluently. He also runs a bookie shop, earning 800,000 yen every month, and uses the money to hang out at membership bars and in Hawaii, where he has unfathomable relations with mobsters and wrestlers. He has a distinctive face, and Kurosawa thought he looked \\"like a Martian,\\" but for some reason he is extremely popular with the girls. Truly a perfect human being, Kurosawa even went so far as to feel inferior to his junior high school counterpart. In the spin-off work Saitsuyo Densetsu Nakane, he appears as a 24-year-old company employee working at Suehiro Bank. He has dyed his hair black and seems to have become quite docile not only in his appearance but also in his friendships, and he strives to gain as many likes on Instagram as possible. =Miscellaneous= ; : A 28-year-old part-time clerk at a video rental store. Fed up with his lazy life, he happens to be present at a diner where Kurosawa organized a rally for a duel with the middle schoolers. He overhears Kurosawa's assertions by chance and is emotionally moved by them, calling Kurosawa \\"master\\" and admiring him. ; : A junior high school student who is not attending school. He is at the diner where Kurosawa decides he's going to duel and is affected by it. He states that he doesn't know why he's not going to school, but in reality it's due to bullying and blackmail. Encouraged by Kurosawa's fight, he stood up to the delinquents alone and, with the help of Kurosawa and his father, escaped from getting blackmailed. He later appears in Saitsuyo Densetsu Nakane, where he is Nakane's coworker. ; : One of the homeless people living in a public park.

Despite claiming to have abandoned all hope, on the other hand, he keeps the suit that he used to wear in order to get a job. ; : A widowed old woman living with the homeless people. She has lived an unfulfilling life and always laments that she wasn't instead named \\"Okane\\" (which means \\"money\\" in Japanese) when she was born. ; : A lazy son of the director of a major hospital and medical student himself. He uses his financial muscle and illegal drugs to control a biker gang known as Gallon Kids. According to Nakane, he is an atrocious man who commits acts of violence to \\"make memories,\\" attacks homeless people who sleep in parks, and fleeces them of what little money they have. When Kurosawa happens to be up against biker gang members, he leads an army of about 50 men into a struggle between Kurosawa and a group of homeless people. In Shin Kurosawa, he became the director of his father's hospital and Kurosawa's attending physician. =Shin Kurosawa: Saiky≈ç Densetsu characters= ; : A pair of gay men who are in the same hospital where Kurosawa is.

His eccentric personality is due to his lack of patience since he was young and blaming everyone around him for his failures in life.

He goes to Okutama to practice the \\"Earth Conduction\\" ritual, but collapses on the way from heat stroke and is saved by Kurosawa. Without knowing why, Kurosawa, who pretended to be him, asks him if he is stupid enough to do such a meaningless thing, and he stops practicing the ritual. ; : Misaki's father, 49 years old. He is the head of an aikido dojo, and although he accepted a fixed match from the Aiki school at the national aikido tournament, Koinosuke ignores the arrangement and embarrasses him.

He asks Kurosawa and his friends to take revenge on him by breaking the fixed game by posing as a shill at a fencing and judo demonstration starring Koinosuke. ; : An instructor of the aikido school called Aiki. He is 27 years old and immensely popular among mistresses because of his looks.

In the Islamic view, jihad is two types: # External jihad ( physical jihad): *Jihad (the help of God's religion) is with pen or tongue or sword. # Inner jihad ( spiritual or jihad al-nafs ): *Jihad al-nafs is against all evil, anger, lust, insatiable imagination and any other bad morality in humans.

Copper Benchmark is situated on the crest of the Cascade Range between Kangaroo Pass and Copper Pass. It was used as a triangulation station for early surveying. It is protected by the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness within the Okanogan National Forest. Copper Benchmark has a subsidiary peak, Pica Peak (elevation , which is northwest of the summit. The nearest higher peak is Wallaby Peak, to the northeast. Precipitation runoff on the north side of the mountain drains into the Methow River via Early Winters Creek, whereas the other sides of the mountain drain into tributaries of the Chelan River. Climate Copper Benchmark is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Copper Benchmark seen from Wallaby PeakThe history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It was also known as the Blighton Arms and Flemings Public House in its time as an inn, while the main house on the property became known as Mulgrave Place. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups. The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport. Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. On 1 January 1810, Lachlan Macquarie replaced William Bligh as Governor of New South Wales. Under Macquarie's influence, the colony prospered. Macquarie's vision was for a free community of white people, working in conjunction with the penal colony. He implemented an unrivaled public works program, completing 265 public buildings, establishing new public amenities and improving existing services such as roads. Under his leadership Hawkesbury district thrived. On 6 December 1810, Macquarie recorded in his journal that on that day he had named what were to become the five Macquarie Towns in the Hawkesbury district. Following Macquarie's proclamation, Pitt Town became a more permanent township with streets and public buildings. Henry Fleming was a convict on the third fleet, arriving in Sydney in 1791. After obtaining his freedom in 1791, he applied for land at Pitt Town. Presumably he was granted the land now fronting Bathurst Street and set about building first a well, then a kitchen, followed by a barn and finally the main homestead. Fleming operated the Blighton Arms, also known as Flemings Public House, on the site from 1816 until 1819 when his license was withdrawn for operating an \\"irregular and riotous house\\". There is some confusion as to which building this inn operated from. Possibly it was the kitchen block as a new brick building was offered for sale in 1820 and this was probably the present house. Others believe that the inn operated from the barn/stables building, explaining the unusual brick veneer walls to the northeast end of that building. Fleming's brother-in-law, William Johnston was granted a new licence around 1830 for the Macquarie Arms Inn. Johnston's family purchased the property around 1840. By the time of William Johnston's death in the 1870s, the property was no longer used as an inn. Around that time the property became known as Mulgrave Place. Additions were made to the north of the main house around 1900. Johnston's family retained the property until around 1920 when it was sold to the Greenwalls. The Greenwall family sold it to the present owners in 1982 at which time it was in a poor condition. The Macquarie Arms today is the earliest surviving inn in Pitt Town. The siting of the house at the edge of the ridge overlooking Pitt Town Bottoms is also of importance, taking advantage of the views to the Blue Mountains and reinforcing the relationship between the township and the lower farming land. Some of the early plantings on the site are important in adding to the setting of the building.  Description  On this site there are four buildings: the main house/inn; a separate kitchen; stables/barn; and an early () brick cottage. There are also toilets, a brick well with a domed roof and original sandstone key cut cover. The siting of the complex at the edge of the ridge overlooking Pitt Town Bottoms is also of importance, taking advantage of the views to the Blue Mountains and reinforcing the relationship between the township and the lower farming land. Some of the early plantings on the site are important in adding to the setting of the building. ;Inn The main building is an important substantial jerkin-head roofed building with much of its original joinery and fabric intact. The inn building is single-storeyed with a long attic probably used for accommodation, survives in a dangerously derelict condition. The walls show a very interesting type of brick nogging, which may be later brick infill between the principal posts of an original slab building - it ought certainly to be thoroughly recorded. The cedar woodwork in the bar- room was removed in the 1970s. ;Barn The barn/stables is a unique structure with its brick-veneered slab walls and jerkin-head roof. ;Homestead The much grander \\"Mulgrave Place\\" jerkin-head house on the same property is adjacent to the earlier cottage but certainly in existence in by 1823. It is parallel to the street. It is a double-storey homestead with a free-standing cellared kitchen. The kitchen has partly collapsed into the cellar. The appearance of the house from Bathurst Street has been altered by the addition of a verandah in 1870, but the original house is of great importance. The upper storey seems to be largely unchanged from an early colonial date. The five upstairs rooms, which have no artificial lighting, use cedar throughout, one has a superb cedar ceiling, two more have painted wooden ceilings and the remainder have lathe-and -plaster. There are chair rails throughout, three of the doors lack, and have always lacked, handles;the hinges are clearly blacksmith- made.Jack, University of Sydney,1981  Heritage listing  The site of the Blighton Arms / Macquarie Arms Inn and Mulgrave Place is of high historical significance as it contains one of the oldest cottages (), the earliest surviving inn (/7) and an early house (pre 1823), kitchen block and stables/barn - one of the earliest building complexes in Pitt Town. It has all the hallmarks of one of the earliest developments after the moving (due to flooding) of the Pitt Town village in 1815. First licensed in 1816, the inn was established in a converted end of a jerkin-head barn associated with the brick cottage. The inn operated as the Blighton Arms or Fleming's Public House (from /7 until 1819, reopening as the Macquarie Arms from around 1830. The site has strong associations with Henry Fleming, a third fleet convict and an early settler in the town who built the complex and operated an inn from the site from 1816 until 1819. It is also associated with his brother in law William Johnston, who operated the inn from around 1830 and whose family retained the property until the 1920s. The site is of high aesthetic significance as one of the earliest surviving building complexes in Australia. The group comprises four main buildings: the main house, kitchen block, early brick cottage and the barn/stables building. Each of these can be considered to be of individual importance as surviving and substantially intact colonial buildings; as a group, their significance is substantial. The main building is an important substantial jerkin-head roofed building with much of its original joinery and fabric intact. The barn/stables is a unique structure with its brick veneered slab walls and jerkin-head roof. The combination of barn, stables and coach house possible early use as an inn is an interesting juxtaposition of functions. The siting of the group at the edge of the ridge overlooking Pitt Town Bottoms is also of importance, taking advantage of the views to the Blue Mountains and reinforcing the relationship between the township and the lower farming land. Some of the early plantings on the site are important in adding to the setting of the building. As an early and intact colonial group on a site which appears to be relatively undisturbed, Mulgrave Place undoubtedly has high archaeological potential. Macquarie Arms Inn was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 2008. Background Samegao castle is located on Shiroyama hill, a 180-meter hill at the western edge of the Takada Plain, which creates a bottleneck on the route to Shinano Province. The lower portion of Shiroyama contains the Hida Site, the ruins of a Jomon period fortified settlement, which indicates that the location was seen as a strategically important place for over 1800 years. After the Fourth Battle of Kawanakajima in 1560, Takeda Shingen seized most of Shinano Province. Shingen's arch-rival, Uesugi Kenshin had his capital at Kasugayama Castle in what is now the city of Joetsu, only 50 kilometers from the border with Shinano. With few natural obstacles standing between Kasugayama Castle and the border, the Uesugi clan quickly fortified the border area and its remaining holdings in Shinano (i.e. Iiyama Castle) against a sudden invasion by Takeda forces. Structure Samegao Castle was one of the relatively large castles in the area, extending over 300 meters across the hilltop, and consisting of three main areas. The inner bailey consisted of several terraces approximately 50 meters long, protected on its north edge by steep dry moats. The entrance was to the east, which was a kuruwa with dry moats and terraces intermittently extending along a long ridge. South of the inner bailey was the third area, with smaller terraces built up the steep hill in steps, and formed the rear of the castle. History Although built primarily to guard against the Takeda clan, Samegao Castle was more deeply connected with the inner struggle of the Uesugi clan following the death of Uesugi Kenshin. Kenshin had two adopted sons, Uesugi Kagekatsu and Uesugi Kagetora, but died without appointing a successor. The clan quickly fell into civil war, with Kagekatsu seizing Kasugayama Castle and making a peace treaty with the Takeda clan. On the other hand, Kagetora was strongly backed by the H≈çj≈ç clan. In April 1579, Kagekatsu made an all-out attack on Kagetora's headquarters at Otate. Kagetora was defeated, and escaped to Samegao Castle, where he committed suicide. The castle appears to have been abandoned shortly after this time. After Oda Nobunaga destroyed the Takeda clan in 1582 and occupied Shinano Province, his forces threatened the Uesugi clan in Echigo, but there is no evidence that Samegao Castle had been rebuilt by that time. During modern archaeological excavations, traces of burnt buildings and carbonized rice were excavated. These materials are evidence of the battle of this time. The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017,a list intended as a sequel of Top 100 Japanese Castles.

Its shares were previously quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange but after a buyout of outstanding public shares by the investment arm of the founder's family, it became privately owned. Seven-Up Bottling Company Ltd is one of the largest manufacturing companies in Nigeria, producing and distributing some of the nation's most- loved beverages in the country like; Pepsi, 7Up, Mirinda, Teem, Mountain Dew, H2oH!, Lipton Ice Tea and Aquafina premium drinking water. SBC has nine bottling plants with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities strategically located across various regions in the country.http://www.https://www.sevenup.org/ production of its first product, 7-Up started on October 1, 1960. The venture was a brainchild of the El-Khalil family from Lebanon. The family patriarch had founded a transport firm in Nigeria and then decided to divest into the soft drink market to compete with Leventis led Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC). In the 1960s, the firm introduced a brand of howdy products including Howdy, Crush, Howdy Tonic Water, and Howdy Ginger Ale. The firm's initial market was within Mid-West and Western Nigeria due to the location of its factory at Ijora, Lagos. To raise awareness and compete with NBC, they distributed outdoor branded kiosks to retailers. In the 1970s, after the government promulgated an indigenisation decree, El-Khalil family sold their transport business and concentrated on the bottling business. Faysal El-Khalil, who managed the transport firm, joined Seven-Up and later became its Managing Director. As the purchasing power of consumers increased, the firm embarked on an expansion programme at the beginning of Nigeria's oil boom during the 1970s. A new factory was built in Oregun and followed by one at Ibadan and then at Aba. The company's push for nationwide coverage has led to factories being built in Kano, Kaduna, Enugu, Benin and Ilorin. Many of its expansion programs were financed with debt. Currently, the firm markets 7-Up, Pepsi, Mirinda, Teem and Mountain Dew. Marketing Seven-Up developed promotions in the late 1980s has a structural adjustment program adopted by the government led to price increases. The promos involved limited prizes drawn under the crown cork of bottles. Consumers could win money, cars or other gift items during the promos. However, the odds of winning was not favorable and this sometimes led to backlash from segments of community. Seven-Up has a history of sports sponsorship in Nigeria. The firm sponsors a youth football academy. The firm also introduced 35cl and 50cl bottles of Pepsi.

He had a deep sonorous voice. He lived up to what he used to say ‚Äì ‚ÄúSureelo kanth, sureelu-n jeevan (A Melodious Voice, A Melodious Life).‚Äù A knowledgeable professor of Physics, he remained steeped in spirituality. He did not receive any formal training in music. He had a natural genius for it. He had the ear to notice the finer qualities of singing that gave it character and the voice that made them his own. Reading enriched his repertoire and interpretation. He took care to constantly expose himself to genuine poetry and to pronounce its words correctly, retaining the Dhwani that gave them their distinctive aural beauty. He was gifted with that rare quality of voice we call Kharaj ‚Äì notes in the lowest octave - rising from within and through sustenance assuming meditative depth and dignity. He accepted having been encouraged and inspired by Sooryakant Dave, Suresh Jani and Purushottam Upadhyay.  Early life  He was born to Durgaba and Ramanlal Desai of a respectable Nagar family in Patan (North Gujarat). His grandmother Mahalaxmiben used to sing Ramcharitmanas fully in her flowing expressive voice. Father Ramanbhai was a singer of repute too. Rasbhai was married in 1964 to Vibha, who had the distinction of having been recognized as a national level singer by All India Radio. She went on to receive the Best Female Playback Singer Award (1989) for the film ‚ÄòKashino Dikro‚Äô, still regarded as a milestone in the history of Gujarati cinema. In the music world, Vibha and Rasbihari Desai remained complementary names. Together they gave over 1,000 performances in Gujarat, outside Gujarat as also abroad. Young Rasbihari Desai  Career  At the age of 19, Rasbihari had the distinction of being All India Radio approved vocalist in light music to be upgraded in course of time to the Top Grade. AIR, and later Doordarshan, regularly invited him to concerts all over India. He remained the nucleus of musical activities throughout his academic career as a professor of Physics and it was often that talents finely honed by him claimed top places at the university and national levels. For training to students for inter-university events, he was almost always invited. At numerous music-orientation camps and workshops organized by the Gujarat University and Government of Gujarat to mould budding singers, he diligently and insightfully followed the indigenous traditional method of imparting training in music. Pranayama, dhyana, breath- controlling exercises, prayers, poetry recitation and appreciation, a scientific approach to developing voice culture and an emphasis on experiencing the divine through it were integral to his interactive music sessions. He conducted such lecture demonstrations and workshops in the United Kingdom and the United States as well. Again, reminiscent of our Parampara, going back to ancient times, quite a few students in his lifetime were welcome to stay in his family, observe and emulate his lifestyle and learn music in the spirit of a sadhana, experiencing the bliss, the ambience and his dedication offered. Performing with wife Vibha Desai =Shruti Vrunda= Rasbihari Desai was instrumental in the formation of Shruti, a group of non- professional proficient trained singers, which in course of time emerged as the benchmark in group singing with a fragrance of the soil in the songs and a refreshing spontaneity in rendering them. Lataji, Salil Chaudhary and Hridaynath Mangeshkar For over 40 years Shruti gave more than 300 performances in Gujarat, Mumbai, Delhi, Nagpur, Kolkata and other places. Music maestros like Lata Mangeshkar, Hridaynath Mangeshkar, Salil Chaudhary, Madan Mohan, Manna Dey, Mohammed Rafi, Laxmikant Pyarelal and Avinash Vyas were among those who highly commended Shruti‚Äôs significant tenacious endeavour. = Bhavan's Sangeet Vibhag = At the instance of Kanaiyalal Munshi, a leading author, a political leader and the founder of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Rasbihari Desai consented to be the mentor of Bhavan‚Äôs Sangeet Vibhag in 1967 and continued the activity consistently for over 43 years. Under his guidance it significantly contributed to Gujarati Kavya Sangeet and Choir Singing. He inculcated in his students having different voices and varying degrees of proficiency, a sense of dedication to music and humility to let individual identity melt and help the group grow. = Thought provoking lectures-demonstrations and articles = Rasbihari Desai enriched Gujarati Kavya Sangeet not only with his melodious voice and lilting compositions but also with his thought-provoking lectures and demonstrations and articles. Vision, Reason, and Precision were the integral elements of his thought process that lent originality and effective expression to his speeches and writings. He was invited to deliver speeches and lectures and demonstrations at various prestigious seminars, conferences, and workshops on music. His conceptual and innovative articles got published in a number of leading newspapers and magazines. = Lecture-demonstrations / workshops / seminars = # In M.S.

Concluding phase of life  Rasbhai was precise and low profile as much in speaking as in writing. The books he read, and he read many, reflected his ardent love for music and spiritual explorations. Shri Dhyani Maharaj Madhusudandasji was his spiritual Guru. He thought himself fortunate to be in live touch with the enlightened personalities like Shri Chidanandaji of Shivananda Ashram, Pramukhswami Maharaj and Shri Vimlatai Thakar through correspondence. All said, music remained an instrument of a spiritual ascent to him. Spirituality was nurtured in him since his childhood by his Foima (Father‚Äôs sister) Nirmalaben Desai, an affectionate and learned lady who used to tell him inspiring stories from Indian scriptures. His young inquisitive eyes also witnessed some such incidents that cannot be interpreted by mere intellect. The imprints of these childhood memories evoked an urge in him to seek the infinite. Some of the experiences Rasbihari himself recounted go beyond the realm of spirituality and have an element of mysticism about them. A couple of days before his marriage, he had for two days remained engaged in a cloud chamber experiment in the darkroom of the physics lab of his college, Gujarat College. It is difficult to say when and how he slipped from the domain of physics to the one of spirituality. His relations assert he did. His individual consciousness became one with the universal consciousness, it was believed. On his return on the evening of 27 May 1964, he explained his absence for two days to the worried family and added that in the state of meditation, he had an intuitive communication that the then Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had passed away and it indeed was true.395x395px Another such incident took place in the year 2007 when while singing in his Pooja room, he heard a voice, different from his own voice. The immense melody of that divine and blissful voice was so overwhelming that he could not help praying to the Almighty to cease his own voice so that only the divine voice could be heard forever. The prayer was answered in 2012. On October 6, his voice ceased to mingle with the divine. He left this ethereal world to merge with the eternal melody. The then Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Narendra Modi along with the renowned personalities from the field of literature and music expressed deep shock and grief. .A great homage was also paid to him by the electronic as well as print media. A Parichay Pustika by Image Publication titled Rasbihari Desai written by Margi Hathi was released by Shri Morari Bapu in the inaugural ceremony of Kavya Sangeet Samaroh- 2013 jointly organized by Gujarat Samachar and Samanvay. A place near his residence is named ‚Äú Sangeetkar Rasbihari Desai Chowk ‚Äú‚Äò by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation as a mark of respect for his unforgettable and valuable contribution in Gujarati Kavya Sangeet. An Award has been floated in his memory since 2014. Sangat Prerit Shri Rasbihari Desai Sanman is conferred every year to a prominent Gujarati Singer in Anushthan, concert of Gujarati music.

He taught inside the University of Altamura. Because of his being a polymath, he's been described as \\"an encyclopedic spirit, the honor of the Muses\\".#uominiill-1822-vol9  Life  Vitangelo Bisceglie was born in Terlizzi, Italy on 30 November 1749. His father was Francesco Bisceglia , while his mother was Chiara Teresa Carnicella#uominiill-1822-vol9 As a child he was very lively and intelligent. At the age of fourteen, he dressed the clerical dress and the bishop of the time, Msgr. Orlandi, was so impressed that he said, \\"Vitangelo will become a famous birbone, or a distinguished scholar\\". He studied Ancient Greek, Latin, French, philosophy, mathematics and anatomy. He was admired and respected by many scholars of his time, and he began to bring his teachings to Terlizzi, in order to revitalize the academy established by Ferrante de Gemmis. At the age of 21, he started a correspondence with Antonio Genovesi whose answers are published in his Libro delle lettere familiari. Letters of Antonio Genovesi to Bisceglia were headed to Donna Orsola Garappa of Monopoli, a student of Vitangelo Bisceglia and wife to Michele Lioy of Terlizzi.raucci-2003, pag. 356, note 25 He then went to Calabria to teach the daughters of Princess Motta Ruffo di Calabria, close relative of the cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo and later in 1776 he graduated both in civil law and canonical law in Naples. In 1783 he accepted the invitation of rector Gioacchino de Gemmis becoming vicar of Altamura's clergymen and also teacher of the University of Altamura, where Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi was already teaching physics. De Gemmis was also very happy with his idea of reorganizing the professorships; after the publication of his first essay on law in which he defended the rights of Altamura Cathedral against the claims of the bishop of Gravina, Bisceglia obtained many offers of promotion to be a bishop, but he refused in order to continue his research on botany, publishing, in collaboration with famous botanist Vincenzo Petagna, a Memory on the causes of tetanus () and he also wrote about philosophy, economics, botany and agriculture, as well as two short essays about local history, even going back to prehistory. He contributed to the writing of the chronicles of the events of Altamuran Revolution (1799) with his work \\"Memories of events in Altamura from January to May 1799\\" (),This work is not present in the book Biografia degli uomini illustri del regno di Napoli (1822) (volume 9) #uominiill-1822-vol9, probably because in 1822, it was still forbidden inside the Kingdom of Naples to talk about the riots of 1799. The work, however, exists and it is contained in the work cronache-1799. Domenico Sacchinelli also briefly talks about this in the first paragraph of his work Memories. being at that time moderator of the local university. He wrote numerous orations, pronounced eulogies in Terlizzi Cathedral for important events, such as the death of notable people or celebratory events related to politics. As mentioned above, he also wrote a work about law, showing that he was also a talented jurist and historian, in the age-old dispute with the bishop of Gravina on the privileges of Altamura Cathedral and his \\"royal patronage\\", which means his being subject only to the king. In fact, he demonstrated that the privileges and tax exemptions enjoyed by Altamura Cathedral were legally right and encompassed by the law of the kingdom. In his work, he explained the results of his research and it was very well received, especially in the city of Altamura. His research went back as far as the Middle Ages, by including the decrees enacted by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. He was also a member of the Accademia dei Forti in Rome, Accademia dei Georgofili in Florence, Royal Society of Encouragement to Natural Sciences of Naples and of various other academies. He died in Terlizzi on 4 October 1817, apparently killed by the gout.

Two years after its release and having received a great deal of publicity, the first peer-reviewed study demonstrated that Sans Forgetica was not effective for enhancing memory. Back- slanted and with gaps in the letter forms, the typeface is designed to reduce legibility; it adds reading complexity to learning tasks based on the psychological principle known as desirable difficulty. It is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license. Development The Sans Forgetica font was developed by RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia in 2018, and is claimed to be specifically designed by a multidisciplinary team of specialists to help people better recall material they have read. It has features of both Geometric and Humanist typefaces, in the traditions of the International Typographic Style and resembles an obscured and disjointed form of a typeface such as Futura. Readers are believed to scan traditional font without difficulty, using their memory of reading skills. Conversely text in an unfamiliar font that is very difficult to read may be counter productive, and so the designers claim to have found an ideal balance between these two extremes that has proved effective with (about 400) students who took part in the development process.RMIT News release 2018/10/03: Sans Forgetica: new typeface designed to help students study Availability The font has been produced for the Latin alphabet. Sans Forgetica is supplied free of charge as an OpenType font file and also available as an extension to the Chrome browser, which produces on-screen text which is intended to have optimal retrieval difficulty.Sans forgetica free download site The downloadable zip file includes an open type file (SansForgetica-Regular.otf) compatible with most operating systems including Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux (via Font-viewer/install). There is also as a brief explanation of the development process (The story of Sans Forgetica.pdf). Evidence Sans Forgetica was spawned from a study of 96 Australian university students. An online experiment including 303 students followed. As of October 2019, no peer-reviewed research or data has been released that supports the assertions of the Sans Forgetica team. Research involving 882 people, published in the journal Memory and reported in May 2020, found no evidence that use of the font aided learning or memory, and on a paired-word learning task, actually impaired recall. Additional evidence that Sans Forgetica does not improve memory was published in Memory a few months later.

He later continued his education in England, attending the prestigious Christ Church College at the University of Oxford. Prior to his education in England, Gaekwad had made his debut in first-class cricket for the Hindus against the Parsees at the Bombay Gymkhana in September 1909. He played first-class cricket in England in 1910, when he played for the Gentlemen of England against Oxford University. The following year he made his debut for Oxford University in first-class matches, appearing against Surrey at Oxford, with Gaekwad playing for the university four times in 1911. 1911 proved to be a busy season of first-class cricket for Gaekwad, with one appearance for the Marylebone Cricket Club, which was followed by three appearances for the Indians against county opposition as part of their 1911 tour of the British Isles. He made two first-class appearances for Oxford University in 1912 against the touring South Africans and Australians. He made a final first- class appearance for the university in 1913, against HK Foster's XI.

It was built in 1819. It is also known as Moxey's Farm House. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups. The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport. Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. Clear Oaks is located on part of a grant of 100 acres made in 1804 Governor King to the free settler David Langley. Research by Alan Byrnes has shown that Clear Oaks was built for Langley. It is probable that a James Vincent was involved with the actual building. There was already a building on the site when Langley sold the property to a Joseph Onus in 1819. It is likely Onus improved the building by bagging (rendering).  Description  Clear Oaks is a two-storey brick stuccoed farmhouse of law proportions. It features an encircling verandah to ground floor supported on timber posts, gabled roof sloping at rear, nine pane windows, and unusual six pane exterior doors. The majority of the joinery is intact. The siting is important, and the heritage listing includes the land to the roads and to the bottom of the hill behind.  Heritage listing  Clear Oaks is a good representative example of the Colonial Georgian farmhouse of the Hawkesbury valley. It makes a contribution to the townscape, as the house fills the northern vista of Bosworth Street. Clear Oaks Moxey's Farm House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It dealt with the designation of 1544 acres of private land in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana as \\"critical habitat\\" for the dusky gopher frog by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court vacated the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decision that upheld the designation and sent the case back for further review. Background The dusky gopher frog The dusky gopher frog is critically endangered due to habitat loss, numbering 135 as of 2015; the frog needs ephemeral ponds for breeding, and is only found around one pond in De Soto National Forest, Mississippi. In 2012, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service designated 1544 acres of land (\\"Unit 1\\") situated more than 50 miles from the pond in Mississippi where the frog resides as \\"critical habitat\\". The land, owned in part by timber company Weyerhaeuser and with the rest leased to them for harvesting timber, was last known to have the frogs in the 1960s. Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, land that is not inhabited by a species but is \\"essential for the conservation of the species\\" can be classed as \\"critical habitat\\". Unit 1 has five ephemeral ponds, which are of \\"remarkable quality\\" according to the Fish and Wildlife Service, but does not have open canopies, another required characteristic for it to be a habitat for the frogs. Weyerhaeuser argued that the land only has one of the required characteristics for being a habitat for the frog and that \\"Vast portions of the United States could be designated as critical habitat if a single feature used by an endangered species is present\\". The government, by contrast, said that it is feasible to transform Unit 1 into a habitat for the frogs and that there is no immediate impact of the designation, and cited multiple scientific studies to say that the land was vital for the conservation of the frog. It also argued that since the frog is only found in one area, transplanting the frog to other areas is necessary to prevent the extinction of the frog. As the designation could cause $33 million in devaluation of the land over 20 years due to implications on possible future development, Weyerhaeuser challenged the decision. The Eastern District Court of Louisiana upheld the designation in 2013, and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed it 2-1 in 2016, holding that the Fish and Wildlife Service was not arbitrarily designating Unit 1 as \\"critical habitat\\", and that while under the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service \\"may exclude any area from critical habitat if [it] determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat\\", a decision not to exclude based on economic impact was not subject to judicial review. Supreme Court The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in January 2018. Oral hearings occurred on October 1, 2018, prior to Justice Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Court. The Court issued its unanimous decision on November 27, 2018, vacating the Appeals Court decision and sending the case back for further review. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the Court, instructed that the Court of Appeal must review the case in light of how the terms \\"habitat\\" and \\"critical habitat\\" are defined by the Endangered Species Act and the nature of how much degree of modification needs to be made to make a habitat a critical habitat, and to review the Service's decision not to exclude Area 1 from its cost and benefits analysis, as such decisions are eligible for judicial review.

She wrote several texts on the colony and Nyungar peoples of Southwest Australia, especially those she knew at the region around Broome Hill, Albany, and toward Doubtful Islands Bay. Born in 1857 to Sophia Harriet (n√©e Adcock) and William Carmalt Clifton (1820‚Äì1885) in Middlesex, England, her father's occupation as an agent of P&O; had the family located to Mauritius in 1859 then the Western Australian port of Albany in 1861. Ethel Clifton and her elder sisters were placed among an elite of P&O; officials in Albany society, and commercial rivals to the family of Albert Young Hassell, whom she eventually married on June, 22 1878 at a church in Perth. The couple had three daughters and four sons, she died 30 October 1933. Hassell lived at a station at Jerramungup, remote from large towns and a great distance south of the state's capital Perth. She closely associated with the people of the area for an extended period in the late nineteenth century, recording their beliefs and creation stories on flora, fauna, and the landscape in a diary that was published as My Dusky Friends in 1975. Her reverence for the subject matter is regarded as unusual for the period, as is her thoroughness and care in inclusion of material that included interviews with women of all ages. She corresponded with D. S. Davidson on a manuscript (c. 1930) submitted to Macmillan Publishers toward the end of her life, research that he edited for publication as 'Notes on the ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of south-western Australia' (1936). This followed her own work Myths and folktales of the Wheelman tribe of South-Western Australia (1934) on the Willman people. Her work as an amateur ethnographer is rarely cited and largely unknown, although it contains an extensive and intimate record of the people and environment of Jarramungup, a remote part of a region lacking scientific research in the nineteenth century. In contrast to other women writing within the colonial settlements‚ÄîLouisa Atkinson, Caroline Dexter, Eliza Dunlop‚ÄîHassell does not write of frontier history and conflict arising during colonisation, adopting a uncritical position that the historical events she studied and heard were inevitabilities of 'progress'; events such as the disposition of land entitlement in which the Hassell family were themselves involved. A later researcher (Izett, Ms. 2014) suggests the motive may have been a form of 'tactical advocacy' at a time when the traditional culture of Australia's inhabitants was poorly known if not misrepresented as propaganda. Ethel wrote of her friends, The author's observations, aside from their ethnological value, included botanical notes and local history, and comparisons of the changing landscape to early sketches of King George Sound; examples of these were published in her locally printed work Early Memories of Albany (c. 1910).Mrs A.Y.

History  The army was formed in June 1943 from the 6th Fighter Aviation Corps PVO, tasked with the air defense of Moscow and nearby facilities, under the command of Major General Alexander Borman. It initially included four fighter aviation divisions with a total of seventeen fighter aviation regiments and support units.

Major General Alexey Mitenkov became army commander in April 1944. By the end of the war, the army expanded to include the Leningrad fighter aviation corps, three fighter aviation divisions defending Moscow, and one fighter division each defending Arkhangelsk, Murmansk, and Gorky. It was successively part of the Moscow, Western, Northern, and Central Air Defense Fronts. Mitenkov was replaced by Lieutenant General Serafim Pestov in March 1945; the latter led the army until after the end of the war.

Members of the family are commonly known as mud crickets. Description Ripipteryx sp. (possibly R. biolleyi), Cartago, Costa Rica Ripipterygids are small, often dark-colored, cricket-like orthopterans, between 3 and 14 mm in length. They closely resemble the related tridactylids. Like tridactylids, they have greatly expanded hind femora, and have the ability to swim and jump from the surface of water. They can be distinguished from tridactylids by their uninflated tibiae on the middle pair of legs, unsegmented cerci, rows of comblike teeth on the epiproct, and setae at the tips of the cerciform lobes on the paraproct, as well as through characters of the genitalia. Species in the genus Ripipteryx are typically black or dark brown and often metallic; many are boldly colored or strikingly patterned, with striking white, yellow, and/or red markings. Members of the genus Mirhipipteryx are typically smaller and more drably colored. Distribution and habitat Ripipteryx limbata, Cartago, Costa Rica Ripipterygids are restricted to the Neotropics. They can be found from southern Mexico south to central South America. Like tridactylids, they are typically found in riparian areas, on bare soil, sand, and mud, as well as on rocks, and ‚Äì in some species ‚Äì low vegetation in, near, or above water. In at least some species, individuals are not distributed evenly throughout appropriate habitat, but rather are found in groups. Biology Ripipterygids have been comparatively little-studied, and many aspects of their biology are poorly known, with behavioral observations having only been made on a handful of species. =Locomotion= Like tridactylids, ripipterygids walk quadrupedally using only their first two pairs of legs, and the hind legs are only used for jumping and swimming. Ripipterygids fly when disturbed, often landing on water and swimming back to shore. =Diet and foraging= Ripipterygids are herbivorous, and have been recorded feeding on a variety of different plants, as well as foraging on the ground. Foraging ripipterygids may leave networks of shallow tracks in sandy or muddy soil near waterways. =Burrowing= At least some ripipterygids build short burrows or oval-shaped cells in clay soil or sand, on both flat ground and in vertical banks. These burrows are used for temporary shelter, and may also be used for protection while molting. =Daily activity pattern= Species vary in their activity patterns; some are most active during dawn and dusk, and others are active throughout the day even in direct sunlight. One species studied was nocturnal. =Breeding= In Ripipteryx notata in Uruguay (near the southern limit of the family's geographic distribution), females oviposit eggs singly in bare soil in spring and summer. Nymphs are present in summer and early autumn (whereas adults are present year-round). Unlike in grasshoppers, embryonic molt has not been observed to occur in ripipterygids. =Predation= Fish have been recorded preying on swimming ripipterygids. Taxonomy and evolution Ripipteryx diegoi Ripipteryx gorgonaensis Ripipteryx guacharoensis Ripipterygids, tridactylids, and sandgropers comprise the superfamily Tridactyloidea within the suborder Caelifera (grasshoppers). The tridactyloids are sister to the remainder of Caelifera. Within Tridactyloidea, ripipterygids are sister to tridactylids; the two families are estimated to have diverged between 150 and 175 million years ago. Ripipterygids were initially included in the family Tridactylidae. They were first elevated to family rank (as Rhipipterygidae) in 1939. The classification of the family was extensively revised in a series of works by Kurt G√ºnther between the 1960s and 1990s. However, the taxonomic diversity of the family, particularly in Central America, is still incompletely known. Two extant genera of ripipterygids are recognized: Mirhipipteryx and Ripipteryx. Since the 1960s, the genus Ripipteryx has been divided into five species groups, based primarily on characters of the male genitalia. However, there is evidence that these groups are not monophyletic. In addition, Ripipteryx itself may be paraphyletic with respect to Mirhipipteryx, suggesting additional taxonomic revision of the family is required. Both Mirhipipteryx and Ripipteryx have representatives distributed throughout the geographic distribution of the family, as do all of the Ripipteryx species groups apart from the Scrofulosa group, the members of which are all restricted to Central America. =List of species= The following recent genera, species and subspecies of Ripipterygidae are recognized by OSF: * Mirhipipteryx G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx acuminata G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx andensis G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx biloba (Hebard, 1928) * M. b. aberrans G√ºnther, 1989 * M. b. biloba (Hebard, 1928) * M. b. chiriquensis G√ºnther, 1969 * M. b. incurvata G√ºnther, 1989 * M. b. riofriensis G√ºnther, 1969 * M. b. sevillensis G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx columbiana (G√ºnther, 1963) * M. c. columbiana (G√ºnther, 1963) * M. c. tenaensis G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx disparilobata G√ºnther, 1989  Mirhipipteryx hebardi (Chopard, 1931)  Mirhipipteryx hondurica G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx hubbelli G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx imperfecta G√ºnther, 1989  Mirhipipteryx lilo G√ºnther, 1969 * M. lil. granchacensis G√ºnther, 1977 * M. lil. lilo G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx lineata G√ºnther, 1989 * M. lin. anchicayensis G√ºnther, 1994 * M. lin. lineata G√ºnther, 1989  Mirhipipteryx lucieni G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx magdalenensis G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx panamica G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx peruviana (Saussure, 1896)  Mirhipipteryx phallica G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx pronotopunctata G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx pulicaria (Saussure, 1896) * M. pu. interposita G√ºnther, 1969 * M. pu. pulicaria (Saussure, 1896)  Mirhipipteryx schuchmanni G√ºnther, 1994  Mirhipipteryx striatipes (Chopard, 1954)  Mirhipipteryx triangulata G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx unispinosa G√ºnther, 1989  Mirhipipteryx variabilis G√ºnther, 1969  Mirhipipteryx venezuelensis G√ºnther, 1976 * Ripipteryx Newman, 1834  Limbata-Marginata group * Ripipteryx boliviana Bruner, 1916 * Ripipteryx cruciata Bruner, 1916 * Ripipteryx cyanipennis Saussure, 1874 * Ripipteryx furcata G√ºnther, 1976 * Ripipteryx hydrodroma Saussure, 1896 * Ripipteryx lawrencei G√ºnther, 1969 * Ripipteryx limbata (Burmeister, 1838) * Ripipteryx marginata Newman, 1834 * Ripipteryx notata (Burmeister, 1838) * Ripipteryx ornata Chopard, 1927 * Ripipteryx rivularia Saussure, 1896 * Ripipteryx saopauliensis G√ºnther, 1969 * Ripipteryx trilobata Saussure, 1874 * Ripipteryx trimaculata G√ºnther, 1969  Crassicornis group * Ripipteryx antennata Hebard, 1924 * Ripipteryx atra Serville, 1838 * Ripipteryx capotensis G√ºnther, 1970 * Ripipteryx crassicornis G√ºnther, 1969 * Ripipteryx gorgonaensis Baena-Bejarano & Heads, 2015 * Ripipteryx laticornis G√ºnther, 1963 * Ripipteryx nodicornis Hebard, 1924  Forceps group * Ripipteryx carbonaria Saussure, 1896 * Ripipteryx diegoi Baena-Bejarano, 2015 * Ripipteryx ecuadoriensis G√ºnther, 1962 * Ripipteryx forceps Saussure, 1896 * Ripipteryx nigra G√ºnther, 1963 * Ripipteryx paraprocessata G√ºnther, 1989 * Ripipteryx pasochoensis Heads, 2010 * Ripipteryx processata G√ºnther, 1969  Marginipennis group * Ripipteryx amazonica G√ºnther, 1969 * Ripipteryx brasiliensis G√ºnther, 1969 * Ripipteryx bruneri Chopard, 1920 * Ripipteryx difformipes Chopard, 1956 * Ripipteryx femorata Chopard, 1956 * Ripipteryx guacharoensis Baena-Bejarano & Heads, 2015 * Ripipteryx insignis Chopard, 1937 * Ripipteryx luteicornis Chopard, 1920 * Ripipteryx marginipennis Bruner, 1916 * Ripipteryx sturmi G√ºnther, 1963 * Ripipteryx vicina Chopard, 1956  Scrofulosa group * Ripipteryx biolleyi Saussure, 1896 * Ripipteryx mediolineata G√ºnther, 1969 * Ripipteryx mexicana Saussure, 1859 * Ripipteryx mopana Heads & Taylor, 2012 * Ripipteryx saltator Saussure, 1896 * Ripipteryx saussurei G√ºnther, 1969 * Ripipteryx scrofulosa Saussure, 1896 * Ripipteryx tricolor Saussure, 1896 In addition, two fossil species have been described, both based on individuals preserved in amber in regions of the world where the family no longer occurs: Mirhipipteryx antillarum Heads, 2010 (from early Miocene amber from Hispaniola), and Archaicaripipteryx rotunda Xu, Zhang, Jarzembowski & Fang, 2020 (from mid- Cretaceous Burmese amber).

Roux was son of Robert Roux, a schoolmaster, and Marie Petit. Roux learned Latin with the parish priest and then obtained a scholarship to study in a Parisian college. He later took holy orders and in 1786 became parish priest of Vignory. He supported the French Revolution and took the oath for the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, following which in 1791 he was named Episcopal Vicar of the Haute-Marne. Early political career In September 1792 Roux was elected from the Haute-Marne to the National Convention, the third out of seven deputies elected, with 188 out of 405 votes. A fervent Montagnard, he was one of the drafters of the Constitution of 1793. At the trial of Louis XVI, he voted against the appeal to the people, for death and against reprieve. During the Insurrection of 31 May ‚Äì 2 June 1793, he strongly supported the fall of the Girondins. Roux was Repr√©sentant en mission to Oise, Marne and Ardennes, where he zealously applied revolutionary policies. He renounced his clerical orders while on mission and married the daughter of a merchant from Laon in January 1794. In this same city and in Sedan, he then opened temples to Reason. He fell out with his colleague Jean-Baptiste Massieu; despite efforts by Collot d‚ÄôHerbois to reconcile them, Massieu accused him of arbitrary measures. The Jacobin club considered this accusation and dismissed it. Later political career In 1794 Roux supported the Thermidorian reaction against Robespierre. In 1795 during the insurrections of Germinal and Prairial he supported state repression and took his revenge on Massieu by bringing accusations against him. On April 4, 1795 he was elected to the Committee of Public Safety and remained there for three months, in charge of trade and subsistence. After the royalist insurrection of 13 Vend√©miaire, he was elected to the short-lived Commission of Five, charged with bringing forward measures of public safety against the royalists. On October 15, 1795 Roux was elected to the Council of Five Hundred by the Ardennes and Nord. He sat for the duration of the Directory and was a loyal supporter of the regime. Apart from his elected positions, in 1799 he worked at the Ministry of the Interior under Nicolas Marie Quinette and after 18th Brumaire he joined the Commission on Emigr√©s. From 1800 to 1802 Joseph Fouch√© employed him as director of the archives of the Ministry of Police. Unemployed after Fouch√©'s resignation, in 1804 he became a tax collector in Dinant in the department of Sambre-et-Meuse. His political career was briefly revived in 1815, during the Hundred Days, when he was appointed subprefect of Laon, but the Bourbon restoration saw him banished from France as a regicide in January 1816. In March he left France and settled in Huy, in present day Belgium. He died a year later at the age of 64.

Taxonomy Butia arenicola was collected by the Swiss physician and botanist √âmile Hassler in Paraguay, in sandy plains in the highlands of the Cordillera de Altos in January 1898 ‚Äì 1899. It was first formally described as Cocos arenicola by Jo√£o Barbosa Rodrigues in 1903, using this specimen as a type.Conservatoire et Jardin botaniques de la Ville de Gen√®ve - G. Geneva Herbarium ‚Äì General Collection (G). Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/rvjdu1 accessed via GBIF.org on 2018-10-09. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1144614655 Max Burret, working in Berlin, moved this taxon to Butia in 1930. Meanwhile, in the United States, Frambach had taken to calling this taxon Syagrus arenicola, although he did not formally move the species. Dahlgren validated this name in 1936. Sidney Glassman recognised the taxon in 1970 under this last name, but in 1979 changed his mind and recognised it under Butia. In 1970 Glassman, who had not travelled to the region to observe the plants in situ, considered the species identifiable in most of the specimens labelled as such that he had examined, but in his entry about the taxon he presents a large amount of text expressing doubts that this dwarf taxon might merely be immature individuals of Butia capitata (in which he included B. odorata), as he theorized that perhaps certain characters which set this taxon apart, such as reduced pinnae (leaflet) width and size of the trunk and inflorescence, were in fact related to age of the specimen. Note that both B. capitata and B. odorata occur far from where B. arenicola was known to grow at the time. An 1848 collection by Anders Fredrik Regnell in Uberaba, Minas Gerais, much earlier than Hassler's collection of the type, was classified as a combination of an inflorescence of Syagrus aff. arenicola and a leaf of S. flexuosa by Glassman in 1968.Orrell T, Hollowell T (2018).

NMNH Extant Specimen Records. Version 1.19. National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/hnhrg3 accessed via GBIF.org on 2018-10-10. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1320607193 Glassman lastly also identified as S. aff. arenicola a specimen collected by Amaro Macedo in 1950 at a locality likely to be Nova Ponte along the Rio Verde, in √Ågua Clara, Mato Grosso do Sul. Note that this area is also the type locality for Butia matogrossensis. Glassman reclassified all these collections as B. arenicola in 1982. In 1995 Henderson et al. considered this taxon a synonym of B. paraguayensis. Rafa√´l Govaerts followed them in 1996, as did Govaerts & Dransfield in 2005, and Lorenzi et al. in the Arecaceae of the 2010 Flora Brasileira. Larry Noblick, a US palm expert, did not follow this interpretation, and was determining herbarium exxicata as B. arenicola by 2007. Noblick re-examined at least one specimen which had been assigned to B. paraguayensis and reassigned this to B. arenicola: an 1882 collection by Benjamin Balansa in Valenzuela, Cordillera department, Paraguay, also collected earlier than Hassler's collection of the type.Conservatoire et Jardin botaniques de la Ville de Gen√®ve - G. Geneva Herbarium ‚Äì General Collection (G). Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/rvjdu1 accessed via GBIF.org on 2018-10-09. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1144614695 In 2009 Irene M. Gauto recognised this taxon as a distinct species, despite otherwise following Henderson et al. in her work acquiring a Masters in Biology degree at the University of Geneva. In 2011 she, along with two co-authors, published an updated version of this work, in which Butia arenicola was again recognised. Soares in 2015 followed these later works in recognising this taxon as a valid, independent species. He, along with R. Pimenta, collected a specimen in 2012 in between the municipalities of √Ågua Clara and Tr√™s Lagoas in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, which he identified as B. arenicola. In 2015 he published a treatment of the entire genus Butia in which he published his opinion on the matter, and this was followed in the Arecaceae section of the Lista de Esp√©cies da Flora do Brasil published by Leitman et al. in 2015. Description This is a solitary-trunked palm with a subterranean trunk only 5 by 8 cm in size. The 3 to 8 leaves have a 15‚Äì34 cm by 1 cm wide petiole with a margin toothed with tiny teeth to only 1mm in length, and a rachis 70‚Äì85 cm in length with 12-30 pairs of pinnae (leaflets) placed at regular intervals in one plane (each pair forming a 'V'-shape). The pinnae in the middle of leaf are 35‚Äì45 cm in length and 0.5-1.1 cm in width. The branched inflorescence is protected in a woody spathe 30‚Äì40 cm in length, of which the swollen part is 10‚Äì28 cm long by 1.5‚Äì3 cm wide; this spathe is usually glabrous (hairless) but may rarely be covered in a tomentose indumentum. The inflorescence has a 13‚Äì25 cm long peduncle with a 0.5‚Äì15 cm long rachis with 3-22 rachillae (branches) 8‚Äì18 cm long. The flowers are coloured cream-yellow or purple. The pistillate (female) flower is only 0.5‚Äì0.8mm in length; the staminate (male) flower 0.8-1mm. The shape of the fruit and that of the nut within is ovoid. The 2.2-2.4 cm by 1.2-1.8 cm fruit are coloured brownish-yellow, with yellow acidic-sweet flesh, and contain 1 to 2 seeds within the 1-1.3 cm by 0.9-1.1 cm nut. =Similar species= In 1979 Glassman provided a key which contrasted this species with Butia capitata (in which he included B. odorata), in which he considered the main difference to be the small trunk, the generally smaller dimensions of the pinnae, spathe, spadix, as well as a one-seeded fruit and tiny 2mm petiolar teeth as opposed to 11 cm-long spines in B. capitata. He distinguished both B. arenicola and B. capitata from B. eriospatha by the hairless spathes. Soares considers the species the most similar to B. matogrossensis. It can be distinguished by always having smaller vegetative parts and sometimes by differences in the relative sizes of the spathe and inflorescence, with B. arenicola having an inflorescence generally enclosed within the spathe. In his 2017 key to the genus, Marcelo Piske Eslab√£o also contrasts it to B. matogrossensis, distinguishing it from this species by yellow instead of red fruit, and smaller spathes and pistillate flowers. It grows in the same areas as B. lepidotispatha, as well as B. paraguayensis and B. exospadix. In the Yaguaret√© Forest in Paraguay it occurs together with B. lepidotispatha and B. exospadix. Distribution It grows in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil and specimens have been collected in the departments of Amambay, Canindey√∫, Central, Cordillera, Itap√∫a, Misiones and San Pedro in Paraguay. Glassman determined two collections from Mato Grosso do Sul as B. arenicola in 1982: one in Jaraguari in 1936, and one in likely √Ågua Clara in 1950. It is now unclear if these identifications were correct. Gauto et al. state their belief in 2011 that this taxon is endemic to Paraguay; it is unclear if that means they disregarded the Brazilian specimens determined as Butia arenicola by Glassman as misidentified, or were unaware of them. In any case, in 2012 Soares collected it again in Mato Grosso do Sul in Tr√™s Lagoas, confirming its presence. By 2017 it had been collected (or identified as such) in at least two locations in Brazil; the afore-mentioned collection by Soares and a 1987 collection from Bela Vista by E.L. Perez. It may have been collected in Uberaba, Minas Gerais in 1848, but it is unclear if Glassman correctly identified this collection. With an estimated extent of occurrence of approximately 17,500 km2, it has a wider range than most species within the genus Butia. Within this estimated extent of occurrence, it was calculated to occupy some 10,000 km2 (the area of occupancy), giving it an abundance of 57%, which is rather average within the genus Butia. As of 2017 it is known from at least 13 collection localities. Habitat It grows in cerrado in Brazil. It grows in cerrado and a habitat called \\"wet chaco\\" in Paraguay. The areas it grows in have marked seasonal differences, with a cooler, very wet winter where the surface may temporarily be flooded in low-lying places, and hot and dry summers with often prolonged droughts. Conservation In 2011 Gauto et al. considered this species to be of 'least concern' in Paraguay. They consider it probable that it has a wider distribution than at that time known, and that it is likely under-collected, although they mention that so little collection of this taxon has occurred that the low amount of specimens they used in their calculations may cause their method of estimating the population to show a larger extent of occurrence than may actually be the case. As of 2018 the conservation status has not been evaluated by the Centro Nacional de Conserva√ß√£o da Flora in Brazil, but in a 2017 dissertation by Eslab√£o he advocates to classify the species as 'vulnerable' for Brazil as the IUCN categories B1ab (i, ii, iii) apply; this means that the estimated estimated extent of occurrence (see distribution above) was lower than 20,000 km2, it occurs in less than 10 localities in Brazil, and that according to Eslab√£o the population was highly fragmented and in decline. The only known population to be found protected within a nature conservation area is at the Yacyret√° Dam Island Reserve at Parque Nacional Lago Ypacarai in Itapua, Paraguay, with three known localities here.

She was an important figure in the theatre history of India, founded and managed the Sans Souci Theatre (1839-49), one of the first professional English theatres in the city of Calcutta, and regarded as the leading lady of the Calcutta stage in her time.Shaw, Dennis. \\"Esther Leach, The Mrs. Siddons of Bengal\\"‚Äò, Educational Theatre Journal, X, 304-310 She was referred to as the Indian Sarah Siddons.Shaw, Dennis. \\"Esther Leach, The Mrs. Siddons of Bengal\\"‚Äò, Educational Theatre Journal, X, 304-310 Life Esther Leach was the daughter of a British soldier, a \\"Mr. Flatman\\", stationed in Meerut. She married the non- commissioned officer John Leach and became the mother of the actress \\"Mrs. Anderson\\". Esther Leach was given scholastic training by the regimental pedagogue in Berhampur. She performed in amateur theatrical performances given for the army, and attracted great attention and popularity for her performance. The officers presented her with the works of Shakespeare. She can be argued to have been the first professional actress in India. She was active at the Calcutta Theatre and the Dum Dum Theatre in Calcutta and, in 1822, the manager director of the Dum Dum Theatre. Between 1825 and 1838, she was the leading lady and star attraction of the Chowringhee Theatre.P. Guha-Thakurta, Bengali Drama: Its Origin and Development Her career at the Chowringhee Theatre took place in parallel with the theatre's golden age, and its success has been attributed partially to her. She departed India for England in 1838. Upon her return in 1839, she founded the Sans Souci Theatre after the destruction of the Chowringhee Theatre. She founded the theatre in collaboration with the art connoisseur Mr. Stocqueler and the support of the elite of Calcutta, who felt the need for a theatre to replace the Chowringhee Theatre, and the Sans Souci Theatre was inaugurated in a temporary building in August 1839, and inaugurated its own building on 8 March 1841. It was described as an elegant little theatre with room for 400 people. She was remarkably successful with her theatre and attracted both the British as well as the Indian audience in Calcutta. On 2 November 1843, her dress caught fire during a performance on the Sans Souci. She contracted severe burn injuries, and died a few days after. On her deathbed, she transferred the ownership of the theatre to her colleague Nina Baxter.

It was the main venue for British theatre in Calcutta, as well as India, during is duration. It was also to be the only public theatre in Calcutta and India long after its demise. History On May 1838, the British theatre in Calcutta, the Chowringhee Theatre, burned down. One of its most popular star actors, Esther Leach, Dictionary of Indian Biography suggested the construction of a new theatre to replace it. She was supported by the art connoisseur Mr. Stocqueler, and funds collected from the British and elite Indian theatre enthusiasts of Calcutta, such as Governor-General Lord Auckland and Prince Dwarkanath Tagore. She opened the Sans Souci Theatre on 21 August 1839. It was by that time situated on the bottom floor of St. Andrew‚Äôs Library at Waterloo Street, which was converted in to a theatre hall until a proper theatre building could be constructed. The theatre hall had room for 400 seats and was described as an elegant and sufficient locality. The new building of the Sans Souci Theatre was inaugurated on No. 10 Park Street on 8 March 1841. The playhouse was a large building designed by J. W. Collins. The Sans Souci Theatre enjoyed remarkable success during its first years, when Esther Leach was its manager and director. It attracted both British as well as the elite Indian Bengali audience of Calcutta. On 2 November 1843, Esther Leach contracted severe burn injuries onstage and died. She transferred the ownership of the theatre to her colleague Nina Baxter. Baxter is described as a skillful actor, but she had no success. James Barry took over the theatre in 1844. It was on Sans Souci Theatre that Esther Leach's daughter \\"Mrs. Anderson\\" debuted in 1848. The perhaps most significant occasion on the Sans Souci Theatre was on 19 August 1848, when Baboo Baishnab Charan Addy performed the lead role of Othello, which was the first time an Indian actor performed in an English role in an English theatre on stage.The Theatres in Calcutta since 1755 =Closure= The Sans Souci Theatre never really recuperated after the death of Esther Leach, and it was forced to close in 1849. While British theatre companies often visited Calcutta on tours to India, there was no new British theatre founded in Caclutta to replace the Sans Souci Theatre the years after its closure, and the theatre audience took to visit the performances of the school theatres of the David Hare Seminary and the Oriental Seminary.Theatre and National Identity in Colonial India: Formation of a Community References * Theatre History and Historiography: Ethics, Evidence and Truth * Dictionary of Indian Biography * The Theatres in Calcutta since 1755 * Theatre and National Identity in Colonial India: Formation of a Community Category:Former theatres Category:Theatres in Kolkata Category:1839 in India Category:19th century in Kolkata ","title":"Sans Souci Theatre (Calcutta)"},{"id":"58673125","text":"M≈†K Slovan Trenƒçianske Teplice is a Slovak football team, based in the town of Trenƒçianske Teplice.

The battle was part of the Sertorian War and ended in victory for Sertorius and his rebels. The battle was recorded in detail by Frontinus in his Stratagems and by Plutarch in his Lives of Sertorius and Pompey.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.31; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18.3; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 18; John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp 226-227; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 96-101. Background In 88 BC Lucius Cornelius Sulla marched his legions on Rome starting a civil war. Quintus Sertorius, a client of Gaius Marius, joined his patron's faction and took up the sword against the Sullan faction (mainly optimates). After the death of Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gaius Marius, Sertorius lost faith with his faction's leadership. In 82 BC, during the second war against Sulla, he left Italy for his assigned propraetorian province in Hispania.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius , 6. Unfortunately his faction, the Marians, lost the war in Italy right after his departure and in 81 BC Sulla sent Gaius Annius Luscus with several legions to take the Spanish provinces from Sertorius.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 7. After a brief resistance Sertorius and his men are expelled form Hispania. They ended up in Mauretania in north-western Africa where they conquered the city of Tingis. Here the Lusitanians, a fierce Iberian tribe who were about to be invaded by a Sullan governor, approached him. They requested Sertorius to become their war leader in the fight against the Sullans. Sertorius accepted the request and so well into 80 BC Sertorius landed at the little fishing town of Baelo near the Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar) and returned to Hispania.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.64; Spann, Quintus Sertorius, pp. 56‚Äì7 Soon after his landing he fought and defeated the Sullan general Fufidius (the aforementioned Sullan governor) at the Baetis river. After the Baetis victory he defeated several Sullan armies and drove his opponents from Spain. Threatened by Sertorius' success the Senate in Rome upgraded Hispania Ulterior to a proconsular province and sent the proconsul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius with a large army to fight him.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.68. Sertorius used guerrilla tactics so effectively he wore down Metellus to the point of exhaustion while Sertorius' legate Lucius Hirtuleius defeated the governor of Hispania Citerior Marcus Domitius Calvinus. In 76 BC the government in Rome decided to send Pompey and an even larger army to help Metellus.Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 17. In the same year Sertorius is joined by Marcus Perpenna, who brought him the remnants of the army of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the rebel consul of 78 BC.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 15. Thus reinforced Sertorius decided to try and take the Spanish east coast (because the cities there support his enemies). His first target was the city of Lauron.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.96 Prelude Lauron was strategically located between Pompey's legions and those of his colleague Metellus. Sertorius wanted to prevent Pompey from linking up with Metellus and also punish Lauron for siding with his opponents. Pompey wanted to finish off Sertorius quickly and take credit for finishing the war in Spain so both men marched for Lauron.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.47 Sertorius arrived first, and began to lay siege to the city. Pompey had a veteran army (recruited from among Sulla's veterans) of 30,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry and was very confident of victory. When he arrived he built his camp close to that of Sertorius to force Sertorius into battle.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 97. ::Pompey, was delighted with the way things had turned out, for he now positioned his army so that Sertroius was, as he believed, caught between the city and the army. So Pompey sent a messenger to the people of Lauron. He invited them to celebrate, and take their seats along the city wall to see how Sertroius enjoyed being besieged. Sertorius was told of this, and found it highly amusing. Sulla's pupil (as he jokingly liked to refer to Pompey) was due another lesson ‚Äì this time from Sertorius himself.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 18. Sertorius responded by sending out his light troops and cavalry to harass Pompey's foragers. He ordered his men to concentrate on the forage parties in the nearby areas but to leave the Pompeians in the more distant tracts. Eventually, tired of the continual raids, the Pompeians moved their foraging operations to the more remote areas. This was what Sertorius had been waiting for. During the night he ordered ten cohorts of heavily armed troops and ten cohorts of light troops under the command of Octavius Gracinus, along with Tarquitius Priscus and two thousand cavalry to move out of his camp and lay an ambush against the foragers. The battle Pompey's foragers had also been out overnight, and were well loaded with supplies. When they were heading back to camp they were suddenly attacked by the light-armed Iberians. The Pompeians tried to form battle lines but before they could do so the Sertorian heavy infantry charged them from the woods. The charge broke the Roman battle line and routed the entire foraging party, they ran for the safety of Pompey's camp. At this point the Sertorian cavalry was unleashed and started riding down the fleeing Pompeians turning the rout into a massacre. Furthermore a squadron of 250 cavalry had set out for Pompey's camp the moment the opening attack started and were now working their way back killing every Pompeian they encountered.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.31; John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp.226-227; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.96-101. When Pompey became aware of his foragers predicament he sent one of his legates, D. Laellius, with his legion to cover his men's retreat. The advancing legion encountered the Sertorian cavalry and forced them back to the right flank where they fell out of sight. They then encountered the Sertorian infantry. While they were forming up to engage the infantry they were hit in the rear by the Sertorian cavalry who had circled around. As the legion recoiled from the shock of this unexpected attack they were attacked from the front by the Sertorian infantry. Like the foragers before them they broke and fled, and the massacre continued. By that time Pompey was leading out his entire army and forming them up to come to his men's rescue. As he was preparing to march, Sertorius led out his remaining troops and drew up for battle. Pompey now had a dilemma on his hands. If he marched to rescue his men, Sertorius could hit his rear or flank, with disastrous results. If, on the other hand, he would advance on Sertorius then his retreating force would probably be destroyed and he still would have to fight an uphill battle, this seriously increased the odds of Pompey's army suffering a crippling defeat. Pompey's only logical course of action was to stay put and he did. He was forced to become a bystander while his men were cut down before his eyes. The Pompeian army lost ten thousand men.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.31; John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.227. With morale very low, Pompey's army was confined to camp while Sertorius burned down Lauron. It was only the arrival of Metellus and his army who prevented Sertorius from finishing off Pompey. Not willing to be caught between two Republican armies Sertorius had to withdraw.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.101 Aftermath The battle was spectacular victory but not a decisive one, for Pompey and his army remained a force to be reckoned with and Sertorius had to withdraw when Metellus arrived on the scene. The war in Hispania would rage on for several more years and only ended when a number of his own men plotted against Sertorius and assassinated him.

Locksmith scams have been reported in the U.S., the U.K., and New Zealand. The scams work by flooding business-finding services with a multitude of faux business listings. All of the phone numbers of these listings eventually link back to a single operation, usually without a legitimate address or license. The descriptions will be similar to legitimate locksmiths, accompanied by similarly misleading advertising, and usually quoting an unusually low price. The person who turns up may perform shoddy work and then overcharge for the service and parts. Since the customer never knows the real business or people involved, at best they can ask for a single phony listing to be removed - a process that takes time and does not negatively impact the scammer much, as they can simply create more fake listings. Side-effects of the scam include damage to legitimate locksmiths who lose business and tend to get angry calls from people believing them to be responsible. Google Maps has been particularly vulnerable to this operation in the 2010s. It began requiring people advertising locksmith services in the US or Canada to complete its \\"Advanced Verification\\" process as of 2018, but does not do so in other markets. Structure Such scams may involve: * Lead generation, designed to confuse potential customers into believing that the scammer is a legitimate, but low-priced, locksmith:  Creating websites, search engine advertisements and business directory listings designed to resemble those of legitimate locksmiths.  Using retouched photographs depicting locksmith stores at locations where no store actually exists.  Procuring dishonest reviews.  Using names similar or identical to those of legitimate locksmiths.  Using addresses that are either fictitious, or are P. O. boxes, or belong to an existing home or business (sometimes, but not always, a locksmith business).  Driving up the price of online advertisements to make them unaffordable for legitimate locksmiths. (Locksmiths businesses are among those worst affected by click fraud.)  Calls being routed to a call centre, rather than to an actual locksmith.  Unrealistically low prices advertised, or quoted by the call centre, together with the caveat, \\"and up\\". * Lead conversion, in which the mark is bluntly persuaded to part with money:  Using vehicles that have no signage or only magnetic stick-on signage, to reduce accountability.  Using staff lacking identification or uniforms, again to reduce accountability.  Disinterest in the customer's right to access the vehicle or building to which the call-out relates; for example, failing to ask the customer for ID or proof of ownership.  Refusing to provide a written estimate, also to reduce accountability.  Insisting upon the use of destructive rather than non-destructive entry, typically by destroying the original lock and necessitating the purchase of a replacement lock.  Charging excessive prices, even if low prices were advertised or quoted by the call centre (i.e. bait-and-switch).  Insisting upon payment by cash or debit card (because if paid by credit card, the charges are potentially reversible). Legal action Locksmiths and other observers have noted that search engine companies make substantial income from paid-for listings, regardless of whether the listings are legitimate or spam. Writing in 2016, Cory Doctorow claimed that \\"Nearly every locksmith that appears on Google Maps is a fake business that redirects to a call center ... that dispatches a scammy, distant, barely trained locksmith who'll come and charge you 5-10 times more than you were quoted.\\" In the U.S. in 2005, a Bronx-based company was sued by the Chicago Department of Consumer services for alleged consumer fraud. In the U.S. in 2009, three alleged locksmith scammers were unsuccessfully prosecuted in St. Louis. In the U.K. in 2010, a locksmith scammer was successfully prosecuted. In the U.S. in 2014, a locksmith based in Virginia sued Google, Yellowbook (Hibu), and Ziplocal, under numerous laws, requesting that those companies \\"remove fraudulent locksmith listings from their search results\\". This, too, was unsuccessful, due to the companies' immunity under the Communications Decency Act. In the U.S. in 2017-2018, a group of 14 locksmiths filed a lawsuit against Google, Yahoo, and Bing, alleging that these search engines allowed spam listings to drown out legitimate, organic search results. This class action was dismissed by the US Court of Appeals in Washington DC in 2019. In Eastwood v. Atlas Locksmith Solutions, et. al.(Maricopa County Superior Court, AZ), Atlas disclosed it subscribed to 115 telephone numbers in the Phoenix Metropolitan Market, assigned each of those numbers to an address where Atlas had no location or legitimate business interest, then multiplied those phone number/address combinations by 10 different company names on a spreadsheet causing Veritel (a now defunct telephone company run by Clay Van Doren)https://atos.net/en/expert/clay-van-doren to publish 1,150 separate and distinct fraudulent telephone listingshttp://thelocksmithpolice.com/exhibits/Numbered%20Exhibits/EXHIBIT%20057-Veritel.pdf all promulgated and distributed to consumers by Google, Yahoo, and distributed on a wholesale basis by information brokers including Acxiom and others.http://thelocksmithpolice.com/exhibits/EXHIBIT%20005%20-%20ATLAS.DOC.pdf Google says that it has removed billions of advertisements that violated its policies, and to have improved its verification systems to combat listings fraud. However, although Google now requires people advertising locksmith services in the US or Canada to complete its \\"Advanced Verification\\" process, it does not do so in other markets. Also, Google has reportedly resisted removing fraudulent listings.

It was the second theatre in the city of Calcutta, and its main venue for about thirty years. It was the leading theatre of Calcutta until the foundation of the Chowringhee Theatre in the early 19th-century. History The first theatre in Calcutta, The Playhouse, was a modest local at the Lal Bazar, founded in 1753 and turned into an action house in 1756. It was eventually replaced by the Calcutta Theatre or \\"The New Playhouse\\", which was founded by the auctioner George Williamson in 1775. It was situated near the Northern section of Clive Street and to the north of Writers Buildings, and built funded by the subscriptions sharers of one hundred rupees each. Among the share-holders was the governor, Richard Burwell. Bernard Massinck (or Massing) was recommended to the post of manager of the theatre by David Garrick. The theatre staged English tragedy, comedy and farce in the English language by English actors. The theatre are recorded to have performed Hamlet (15.4*1784), The Merchant of Venice' 18.10.1784) 'Romeo and Juliet' (25*10.1784) and again 'Hamlet' on 18.11.1784. The actors consisted of exclusively male amateurs, but they were reportedly given good training and was very well regarded in their ability, particularly a Captain Call from the garrison, who was dubbed the 'Garrick of the East' by the Bengal Gazette. No women, neither amateurs or professional actresses, acted upon the stage, as the Company directors was unwilling to hire actresses or allow women amateurs to perform, pointing to the scarcity of English women in Calcutta at the time and the concern that women on stage could attract to much attention: no actresses appeared in India until May 1789, on Emma Bistow's amateur theatre, and no professional actresses performed until the Chowringhee Theatre of 1813). The value of the shares of the theatre was gradually reduced and the directors sold it to a private entrepreneur, who staged farces upon the stage, which was not as benefitted. In 1808, the debts led to the theatre being closed. The building and the adjoining site was acquired by Gopi Mohan Tagore, who turned it into the New China Bazar.https://puronokolkata.com/2014/04/15/calcutta-theatre- clive-row-calcutta-1776/ References * P.

It is directed by Kashif Nisar and written by Faiza Iftikhar, starring Iqra Aziz, Imran Ashraf and Syed Jibran. It emerged as one of the most iconic dramas in Pakistan television history. The serial is produced by Momina Duraid under their banner MD Productions.  Plot  The story revolves around a beautiful and idealist girl, Noori, played by Momina Aayla whose adult role is played by Iqra Aziz. Noori belongs to a poor family. Her parents live by picking garbage from streets, therefore she is uncomfortable with the environment around her. She rejects her parents' lifestyle and wishes for a better and respectable life. To fulfill this wish of hers, she moves to a city and starts a respectable living by working in a factory. In this journey, she comes to know of Sahir (Syed Jibran) and Bhola (Imran Ashraf). Sahir is a greedy young man, who works in a shop and wishes for a better future; whereas, mentally weak and childlike Bhola owns a mansion and agricultural land in a village, (which his paternal uncle, Nusrat Chacha, takes care of). Bhola is loved deeply by his mother, Fehmida (Asma Abbas). Sahir and Bhola both get attached to Noor Bano's life, one which is by total deceit and the other is an ordeal. Sahir is not serious about Noori, but Noori is always daydreaming about her marriage with Sahir. Noori somehow convinces him to marry her, to which he nonchalantly agrees. One day, when Noori comes to visit Sahir, she sees that there is some investigation going on and becomes worried when Sahir is found guilty of stealing money from the shop he works in. The police demands ransom for Sahir's release and Noori is thinking of the ways she could get the money. When Noori asks her baji for money, she refuses and her husband also sexually harasses Noori by offering her money to be with him. Noori confronts the factory owner and says she doesn't want his money and quits working at the factory. Noori she steals her Baji's jewelry to pay for Sahir's release. Afterwards, Sahir gets released, whereas Noori is jailed for stealing the jewellery. Noori's father makes a deal with Shokha, an aged smuggler, to free his daughter and marry her. On the other hand, Noori threatens her former boss to either take back the case or she will expose him. The factory does it and Noori is free. However, she still has to get rid of Shokha, so she runs away and goes to Sahir, who is arranging to leave the city. Sahir refuses to marry her, (as he was not sincere with his intentions), saying that she had spent a night in the lock-up and who knows if any lustful policeman had disgraced her. Noori, heartbroken, returns to her mentor, Amma Jannate's house. She asks Amma Jannate to help her because she doesn't want to marry Shokha and is considering suicide. Amma Jannate tells her the only way out is to wed, which will also fulfill her desire of living a respectable life. The person Amma Jannate is talking about is actually Bhola, but Noori isn't aware of it until after her marriage. Has all this happened to her for good and a better future? Initially, Noori can't stand him, even feeling for Bhola. She tries to get away from him, but later she develops love, care, and empathy for him, due to his innocence and pure love for her. This intense story develops from there, and so does Noori and Bhola's unconventional romantic relationship. It ends when she has a baby boy who Bhola refuses to meet as he is afraid of him being like Bhola, but when Noori convinces him to see his baby, he kisses him on the forehead and starts to cry.
