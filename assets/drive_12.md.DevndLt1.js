It is famous for Zhuge Liang, a chancellor of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, who lived there for about ten years. Zhuge Liang is also known as Wolong (ÂçßÈæô, meaning Crouching Dragon), and he was posthumously named the Marquis of Wu. History The worship of Zhuge Liang in Wolong Gang dates from the Jin Dynasty. It flourished during the Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty. In 1317, Emperor Renzong of Yuan gave the historic buildings in Wolong Gang the name of Temple of the Marquis of Wu. In 1711, historic buildings were rebuilt according to the traditional Longgang full picture. The Qing Dynasty built the Wolong gang ten scenic spots and Wolong College. Nowadays, Wolong Gang has historic buildings built during the Yuan Dynasty, the Ming Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty. Wolong Gang also has stone inscriptions, steles, and the couplet, all of them dating from the Han Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty.

Development The biplane was based on the Curtiss Carrier Pigeon, a purpose-built aircraft for airmail operations. The Lark also had a longer-span lower wing, similar to the Carrier Pigeon. Some models were converted to floatplane configuration with a central mounted pontoon and wing-mounted floats. The biplane was made of welded tube with fabric covering. It was available with three engine choices, the Curtiss C-6, the Wright J-4 Whirlwind, and the Wright-Hisso E. All four wing panels were interchangeable, giving the aircraft its unusual longer lower wings. A 200 hp Wright J-4 variant was tested for the United States Navy. This installation proved superior in performance to the Curtiss engined model. This version eventually became the basis for the Curtiss Fledgling series of aircraft. Operational history Curtiss Lark at the 1925 National Air Races Patrica Airways operated a Lark for early bushplane operations. The aircraft flew with floats in warm weather, and skis in the winter. The aircraft was pressed into service as an early hearse once, with the cargo needing to be seated upside down in the open seat and secured with haywire. Florida Airways operated a Curtiss Lark Miss Tallahassee on its CAM-10 U.S. airmail route between Miami and Atlanta. The aircraft was bought to take the place of two lost Stout 2-AT Pullman aircraft that could not operate out of the poorly prepared airstrips. Colonial Air Transport owned a Curtiss Lark which was one of the first aircraft to be registered using the new Underwriters Laboratories all-letter system (1921 to 1923). This Lark, registered as N-AABC, was used on the CAM-1 U.S. airmail route.

In a Frieze review, Morgan Falconer describes Lopez's work as \\"All of these objects are marvelously poised between being one strange thing and something stranger still.\\" Michael Wilson of Artforum reviewed Blue Angels when the series appeared at Simon Preston Gallery in New York: ‚ÄúTurning Minimalist form against itself is hardly a new idea-one might even consider, it a genre unto itself- but it still offers room for maneuver. In Vertical Neck, her second solo exhibition at Simon Preston, Brooklyn-based artist Michelle Lopez presented a strong, clean suite of five new sculptures that capitalize on the movement‚Äôs enduring legacy but sidestep parody and polemic to arrive at a more subtly allusive language.... Three roughly folded and heavily crumpled sheets of aluminum lean against the wall and tower above head height, their interiors painted blue or black, their exteriors white or colorlessly reflective. The suggestion that attempts at formal perfection are necessarily doomed to failure is clear, but in their fun- house-mirror distortions, these works direct that argument at not only artistic folly but also the viewer‚Äôs own vanities and imperfections. Still, the news isn‚Äôt all bad; there‚Äôs an insinuation in the aluminum‚Äôs shiny. paper- like surfaces of gift wrap, a hint of celebration and renewal.... [T]here is a hint of nose- thumbing at the consistent anality of the Guys, but Lopez's remake is more understated, more extensive, more radical-and a lot more appealing-than that might imply.\\" (Artforum, November 2011)https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-272102458/michelle-lopez-simon- preston-gallery Lopez first gained critical attention with her sculpture Boy; a leather covered Honda that made its debut in 2000 as part of P.S.1 / MoMA‚Äôs Greater New York exhibition. Her work examines cultural phenomena related to fanaticism, violence, and questions of identity. Lopez' artistic process looks at post 9/11 experience and its abject residue on the sculptural object. Such forlorn themes can be found in \\"Blue Angels\\", \\"The Year We Made Contact\\", \\"Strange Fruit\\", \\"Banner Year\\". In her Smoke Clouds work, Lopez explores themes of disappearance through the shifting image within the material of silver nitrate (mirroring solution) poured onto large-scale architectural glass. Lopez' mirrored smoke clouds reflect the room and the viewer through the original photographic process of silver tinning. The cloud image appears and disappears as a \\"puff of smoke\\" depending on the environment and the viewers position in the room. Lopez questions the status of the object and the artistic desire to make iconography, while also questioning the viewer's desire to claim it. Her sound and kinetic installation, Halyard, is a further iteration of examining invisible structures of power. Her most recent installation (\\"House of Cards\\") of an abject collapsing scaffolding system has steel rope and street rubble lifting spare, minimal lines, as if forms of resistance could actually overcome the well-grooved forms of oppression.

The race car drivers still had to commute to the races using the same stock cars that competed in a typical weekend's race through a policy of homologation (and under their own power). This policy was in effect until roughly 1975. By 1980, NASCAR had completely stopped tracking the year model of all the vehicles and most teams did not take stock cars to the track under their own power anymore. Background North Wilkesboro carried a reputation as one of the fastest short-tracks in auto racing in the late 1940s and 1950s. In 1950, speeds reached 73 mph at the track, compared to the next fastest short-track, Charlotte Speedway, where top speeds only reached 66 mph. Most of the fans in the early years of the sport saw the track as notorious for being a great venue to watch races between the legendary racers of the time. Racing at North Wilkesboro was intense and physical. The 1950 Wilkes 200 was the second Grand National Series race held at North Wilkesboro Speedway. Twenty- six cars entered the race. Twenty-one-year-old Fireball Roberts qualified with a lap speed of 73.266 mph on the dirt track for his first ever Grand National pole, but engine problems dropped him out of the running. Fonty Flock started in the third position and led the most laps in the race with 104, but engine troubles also ended his day. Ultimately, Leon Sales led eight of the 200 laps to become the victor, the fourth NASCAR driver to win an event in his debut race. Jack Smith finished second after leading 55 laps in the race. After hosting only one NASCAR event in 1949 and one in 1950, the track began running two Grand National Series events per year in 1951 (with the exception of 1956, when only one race was held; the track was being prepared for pavement). One race was held in the spring, normally in late March or early April, and another was held in the fall, normally in late September or early October. In 1957, owner Enoch Stanley had the 5/8-mile track paved. The Wilkes 200 in 1952 turned into a battle between brothers. Two sets of brothers competed in the race, and they took the top four spots at the finish. The Flock Brothers (Fonty Flock and Tim Flock) were strong, but the Thomas brothers (Herb Thomas and Donald Thomas) had the better outcome. Herb Thomas, driving his 1952 \\"Fabulous\\" Hudson Hornet, won the pole, led 192 of the 200 laps, and grabbed the victory. Fonty Flock led the first eight laps and finished the race second. Donald Thomas, also in a 1952 \\"Fabulous\\" Hudson Hornet, finished third, and Tim Flock finished fourth. Eleven of the 27 cars entered in the race finished. Six of the top nine positions were driving Hudson Hornets. Race report It took one hour and twenty-four minutes to race 160 laps on a dirt oval track spanning . Thirteen lead changes were given amongst four different drivers. Three cautions were given for 16 laps in front of 2000 loyal spectators. Herb Thomas would make his first finish outside the top six in 25 races in this event. The top ten finishers were: Speedy Thompson (defeating Flock by two laps), Fonty Flock, Ray Duhigg (finished in a car owned by Julian Petty), Bob Welborn, Lee Petty (father of Richard Petty who started his NASCAR career six years later), Buck Baker, Bill Blair, Joe Eubanks, Jimmie Lewallen, and Bub King. Ralph Dutton was the last-place finisher of the race. The mysterious events surrounding Herb Thomas' first finish outside the top six involved a routine pit stop to put gasoline. After that, it was certainly whether Thomas finished the race in a timely manner or not. Not all the driver numbers have been preserved through the years due to the habit of early NASCAR scorers to throw non-essential statistics into the garbage after each race. Any statistics that remain were kept because they were deemed to be \\"essential information\\". Arden Mounts drove in this race (and later at the 1955 Southern 500 and the 1956 Southern 500). Pete Stewart made his NASCAR Cup Series d√©but here. Although the race had no bearing on the season ending points championship, the race was of extreme importance to Petty. The average speed was while Buck Baker qualified with a speed of . T.H. King, Boyce Hagler and Smokey Yunick were the most notable crew chiefs that played a role in the race. They had Bub King, Buck Baker and Herb Thomas as their drivers. =Timeline= Section reference: * Start: Curtis Turner was leading the racing grid as the green flag was waved in the air. * Lap 7: Buck Baker took over the lead from Curtis Turner. * Lap 8: Curtis Turner took over the lead from Buck Baker. * Lap 9: Buck Baker took over the lead from Curtis Turner. * Lap 11: Curtis Turner took over the lead from Buck Baker. * Lap 18: Buck Baker took over the lead from Curtis Turner. * Lap 70: Fonty Flock took over the lead from Buck Baker. * Lap 89: Buck Baker took over the lead from Fonty Flock. * Lap 104: Fonty Flock took over the lead from Buck Baker. * Lap 106: Curtis Turner took over the lead from Fonty Flock. * Lap 110: Buck Baker took over the lead from Curtis Turner. * Lap 120: Fonty Flock took over the lead from Buck Baker. * Lap 136: Speedy Thompson took over the lead from Fonty Flock. * Finish: Speedy Thompson was officially declared the winner of the event. =Results= { class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - !

He graduated from the American University of Beirut in 1931. He served in the United States Foreign Service from 1920 until his retirement in the early 1960s, most notably as the United States' second envoy to the newly independent nation of Syria. He was the father of Edmund Keeley and Robert V. Keeley. Involvement in the Syrian Coup of 1949 On 30 March 1949, Col. Husni al-Za'im seized power from President Shukri al-Quwatli in a bloodless coup d'√©tat. There are \\"highly controversial\\" allegations that the American legation in Syria‚Äîheaded by James Hugh Keeley Jr.‚Äîand CIA engineered the coup. Assistant military attach√© (and undercover CIA officer) Stephen J. Meade, who became intimately acquainted with Colonel Za'im several weeks prior to the coup and was considered Za'im's \\"principal Western confidant\\" during Za'im's brief time in power, has been described as the coup's architect‚Äîalong with the CIA's Damascus station chief, Miles Copeland Jr. Copeland later authored several books with \\"extraordinarily detailed accounts of CIA operations in, among other countries, Syria, Egypt, and Iran,\\" considered \\"one of the most revelatory set of writings by a former U.S. intelligence officer ever published.\\" However, Copeland's memoirs have a strong literary quality and contain many embellishments, making it difficult to gauge the historical accuracy of the events he describes. Moreover, Copeland's account of the Syrian coup in his 1989 autobiography The Game Player: Confessions of the CIA's Original Political Operative contradicts the earlier version presented in his 1969 The Game of Nations: The Amorality of Power Politics. In The Game of Nations, Copeland suggested that Syria‚Äîas the first former colony in the Arab world to achieve complete political independence from Europe‚Äîwas perceived in Washington as a test case for America's \\"capacity for exerting a democratizing influence on Arab countries.\\" According to Copeland, the CIA attempted to \\"police\\" the July 1947 Syrian national elections, which were marred by fraud, sectarianism, and interference by neighboring Iraq and Transjordan. When these elections \\"produced a weak, minority government\\" under Quwatli‚Äîthe stability of which was called into question by Syria's defeat in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War‚ÄîKeeley and other U.S. officials became concerned \\"that Syria was on the verge of complete collapse,\\" which could have empowered the Syrian Communist Party or other \\"radicals\\" (such as the Ba'ath Party and the Muslim Brotherhood). As a result, Keeley became amenable to a military coup \\"as a way of safeguarding ... the long-term prospects of democracy in the country.\\" At Keeley's behest, Copeland wrote, Meade \\"systematically developed a friendship with Za'im ... suggested to him the idea of a coup d'√©tat, advised him how to go about it, and guided him through the intricate preparations in laying the groundwork for it.\\" Available evidence, however, suggests that Za'im was in little need of prodding from the U.S. According to the British military attach√© in Syria, Za'im had been contemplating a coup since March 1947‚Äîover a year before he was introduced to Meade on November 30, 1948. Shortly before the coup, Za'im tried to win Western sympathy by producing a list of individuals, including Keeley, that were supposedly \\"communist assassination targets,\\" but U.S. officials were skeptical. While Za'im directly informed Meade of the upcoming coup on March 3 and March 7, the U.S. was not the only foreign power apprised: Za'im notified British officials around the same time. In his conversations with Meade, Za'im outlined his progressive political program for Syria (including land reform) as well as the communist threat, concluding \\"[there is] only way to start the Syrian people along the road to progress and democracy: With the whip.\\" Za'im struck a different tone in conversations with the British, citing his desire to establish friendlier ties with Britain's major allies in the area‚ÄîIraq and Transjordan. In The Game Player, Copeland provided new details on the American assistance to Za'im's plan, expounding that Meade identified specific installations that had to be captured to ensure the coup's success. However, Copeland also acknowledged that Za'im had initiated the plot on his own: \\"It was Husni's show all the way.\\" Douglas Little notes that U.S. assistant secretary of state George C. McGhee visited Damascus in March, \\"ostensibly to discuss resettling Palestinian refugees but possibly to authorize U.S. support for Za'im.\\" In contrast, Andrew Rathmell describes this hypothesis as \\"purely speculative.\\" Once in power, Za'im enacted a number of policies that benefited the U.S.: He ratified the construction on Syrian territory of the Trans- Arabian Pipeline (Tapline) (which had been stalled in the Syrian parliament), banned the Communist Party, and signed an armistice with Israel.

The clan does not currently have a chief and is therefore considered an armigerous clan. The Clan Little Society had a Guardian in place of a clan chief but, since his death in 2007, no suitable successor has appeared. Marker for the now-gone tower of Clan Little, Meikledale Valley History =Origins of the clan= According to Black, Little is a descriptive name and was originally written in Latin documents as parvus meaning little or small.George F. Black; The Surnames of Scotland; 1946 New York Library; 1999 Birlinn Limited, Edinburgh; pp. 432 Given that the name is descriptive it is impossible to find any clear origin of the Little name in Scotland. In the 12th century David I King of Scots appointed Walter fitz Alan, an Anglo-Norman from Shropshire, as High Steward of Scotland. In his capacity as Steward, Walter granted lands at Cairntable, Ayrshire to Alan Little, a former neighbour on the Shropshire-Cheshire border.Chalmers, G. (1800). A historical and topographical account of North Britain from the most ancient to the present times, with a dictionary of places chorographical and philological (vol. 6). By 1300 the Littles had settled in Dumfriesshire where Nicol Little was recorded as Conservator of the Peace for Lochmabenston in the Scottish West March of the Anglo-Scottish border.Rymer‚Äôs Foedera; Vol 8, pp 46‚Äì65; October‚ÄìDecember 1398. Sometime before 1426, Simon Lytil was granted tenure of Meikledale, Sorbie and Kirktoun in Ewesdale, Dumfriesshire by the then regent, Robert Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany. The grant was confirmed in 1426 shortly after James I returned from his captivity in England. Simon Little, 1st Laird of Meikledale, is therefore considered to be the first chief of the name.R.B. Armstrong (1883), The history of Liddesdale, Eskdale ... and the Debatable Land. In 1587 the Parliament of Scotland passed a statute: \\"For the quieting and keping in obiedince of the disorderit subjectis inhabitantis of the borders hielands and Ilis.\\" Attached to the statute was a roll of surnames from both the Borders and Highlands. The Borders portion listed 17 \\"clannis\\" with a Chief and their associated Marches. Little was listed as a clan of the West March. [Great Britain III Acts of the Parliament of Scotland pp.466‚Äì467]. =Wars of Scottish Independence= About the time of Alan Little's grant of land at Cairntable, Walter the Steward granted lands near Kilmarnock, Ayrshire to Richard le Waleys, also of Shropshire. This Richard was the g-g-grandfather of Sir William Wallace, one of the main leaders in the early Wars of Scottish Independence. Sir William's sister may have married a Little and had a son named Edward, who became a trusted lieutenant. We believe this because Blind Harry the Minstrel mentioned such a person in his poem The Wallace: \\"And Edward Littil his sisters sone so der / Full wel graithit in till thar armour cler\\".Blind Harry the Minstrel (15th century), Wallace. =15th century= Members of the Little clan became established in Ewesdale, Eskdale and Wauchopedale. Following the House of Douglas' forfeiture as tenants-in-chief, following the Battle of Arkinholm in 1455, the Eskdale-Ewesdale lands passed to the Maxwell clan. The exceptions were the homes of the Littles at Meikledale and the Elliots at Arkelton, which were not feudal property. =16th century= By the start of the 16th century, Clan Armstrong had risen to power such that it was reputed in 1528 that they could muster 3,000 horsemen, Littles amongst them. Their leader, Johnnie Armstrong of Gilnockie, posed a threat to King James V, who arranged in 1530 to meet him at Caerlanrig. The Armstrong retinue was surprised by the king's men, and then 33 Armstrongs, Littles, Elliots and Irvings, including Johnnie, were hanged on the spot.G. McDonald Fraser (1986). The Steel Bonnets. In 1568 over 100 Littles rode with Batysons, Armstrongs, Glendinnings and Thompsons on John Maxwell, 8th Lord Maxwell's raid on Stirling. Family tradition has it that the Littles returned with many more horses than they set out with. They were pardoned in 1585, while Maxwell was briefly serving as the Earl of Morton. =17th century= The Union of the Crowns in 1603 meant that James I of England and VI of Scots no longer had a need for strong men in his 'Middle Shires'. The Border reivers had become a nuisance to the king, and efforts were made to disband them using fire, noose and sword. Many Borderers were transported to Ireland, and others fled into north-west Cumberland. At this time Simon Little of Meikledale was chief, followed by his son, Thomas, and grandson, David, chief in 1670. =18th century= David Little was the last Little to be Laird of Meikledale. Following the Pacification of the Border, the lairdship passed to Thomas Beattie, and David was given work as a groom at Windsor Castle. He had two sons: Simon Little of Nittyholm who had seven daughters, and Matthew (William?) Little who lived in Reading and 'went to sea' in 1745. Any descendants of Matthew have yet to be traced. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Littles migrated throughout the United Kingdom and to North America, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand.

In the play, a tramp/narrator falls asleep in the woods and dreams of observing a range of insects that stand in for various human characteristics in terms of their lifestyle and morality: the flighty, vain butterfly, the obsequious, self- serving dung beetle, the ants, whose increasingly mechanized behaviour leads to a militaristic society.

(p. 225). Discussing The Insect Play, Jarka M. Burien stated \\"Capek imbued the play with a vitality and color that made it a more fully entertaining theatrical experience than R.U.R.\\". However, the 1960 BBC TV production was critically reviewed fifty years later, by a critic who called the text \\"pretentious and incoherent\\". Adaptations Several works have been inspired by the play. Flann O'Brien produced a version of the play set in Ireland, Rhapsody in Stephen's Green. This version was thought lost, but a copy of the play was discovered in 1994.Neil Cornwell, The Absurd in Literature, Manchester University Press, 2006 (p. 253). Finnish composer Kalevi Aho composed an opera Hy√∂nteisel√§m√§√§ (Insect Life) in 1987, which was submitted to a competition for the Savonlinna Opera Festival. Aho's opera lost to Paavo Heininen's Veitsi, and was not performed until 1996 with the Finnish National Opera (for which it received great acclaim). Aho also adapted material from his opera into a symphony, Hy√∂nteissinfonia (Insect Symphony), which premiered in 1988. This work, Aho's Seventh Symphony, features six movements, each a portrait of a different species of insect and reflecting the satirical characterizations of the play. Another opera Zo ≈æivota hmyzu (From the Insects' Life) based on the play was written by J√°n Cikker and premiered in Bratislava in 1987.

Leanne debuted as the mother of established character Nicole Miller (Sally Martin) in a guest role in 2010, before reprising the role in more central positions in both 2011 and 2014. Creation and casting The character of Leanne was created as the mother of established character Nicole Miller (Sally Martin) in a storyline that saw her come out as bisexual to her family and reveal her relationship with Maia Jeffries (Anna Jullienne). Jennifer Ludlam was offered the role due to what she believed as, \\"being a certain age, and looking like I could pass for Nicole's mother.\\" Leanne debuted onscreen in April 2010 and Ludlam enjoyed shooting the show due to the outspoken nature of her character. Ludlam was offered a reprisal of the role the following year and she appeared for 5 weeks in recurring role. She made her last appearance on 25 February 2011. Ludlam was offered to reprise the role 3 years later and agreed upon learning she was going to have, \\"my own arc and be a person.\\" Leanne returned in March 2014, in a more central role that saw her become the receptionist at the hospital. Ludlam found it daunting filming at the reception desk due to its \\"iconic\\" nature and having worked with several former actors who played the receptionist role such as Elizabeth McRae (Marj Brasch), Geraldine Brophy (Moira Crombie) and Alison Quigan (Yvonne Jeffries). Ludlam was pleased how the character had developed following her 2014 return, \\"I feel very lucky. I came in for 6 months because I looked like I could play Sally Martin's mother and then years later I am still here and the writers have - and this is fantastic - have really started writing for me.\\" Storylines In late 2009 Nicole Miller (Sally Martin) informed recently discovered half sister Morgan Braithwaite (Bonnie Soper) that her family were eager to meet her, primarily her mother, Leanne. Several months after Morgans untimely death, Nicole's ex-girlfriend Maia Jeffries (Anna Jullienne) and Gerald Tippett (Harry McNaughton) visited Tauranga to find a recently runaway Nicole and ended up staying at Leanne's house. Nicole and Maia were forced to keep their relationship private due to Leanne's conservative nature but when Nicole eventually came out, Leanne disowned her unless she dumped Maia permanently. Nicole at first accepted but later fled Tauranga and reunited with Maia in Ferndale. The following year Leanne arrived in Ferndale and pronounced her new pro-gay attitude, showing open approval of Nicole and Maia's relationship. However, after discovering Maia had cheated on Nicole, Leanne set about sabotaging the two and tried to set Nicole up with both Hunter McKay (Lee Donoghue) and Maxwell Avia (Robbie Magasiva). Whilst out for a walk, Leanne was mugged and injured, extending her stay in Ferndale that eventually saw her receive a job as the hospital receptionist. However Leanne soon realised she was holding Nicole back from a relationship and returned to Tauranga. In 2012 Nicole visited Leanne after her brother Eric (Mick Andrews) had a severe schizophrenic episode. In 2014 Nicole and Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva) returned to Tauranga after Leanne requested help with Eric once again. However, when Nicole suggested Leanne was the issue, she kicked her out only to show up in Ferndale with Eric. Following Eric being sent into care, Leanne made it clear that she thought Nicole should date Vinnie over girlfriend Harper Whitley (Ria Vandervis). She returned to her role as receptionist at the hospital having sold her house in Tauranga. Leanne had a brief flirtation with Murray Cooper (Matthew Chamberlain) after mistakingly believing he and his wife Wendy (Jacqueline Nairn) were swingers. She began to date Nev Carlson (Stuart Devenie) much to the angst of Nicole, but he left her for one of his five ex-wives. Leanne soon found herself becoming a burden to her family but this changed when she began to date Howard Black (Michael Saccente) who lavished her in expensive gifts. Though it soon turned out he had a potentially terminal illness and he returned to America, with Leanne nearly joining him on the day of Nicole's wedding. In 2016 Leanne began to feel elderly and underwent plastic surgery only for the anaesthetic not to work, leading to her being awake during the aborted procedure. Feeling increasingly unwanted at work, Leanne was overjoyed when Howard returned to Ferndale. The two decided to marry and after realising how much she needed to move on, she left Ferndale. 3 months later, Leanne returned to Ferndale temporarily after her honeymoon with Howard although it soon turned out he had fallen overboard of the cruise ship and had drowned. After Howard's death, she has had 3 relationship stints with Damo Johnson, and also worked 2 stints and PA to Chris Warner (current), and a stint as triage receptionist. In 2019, Leanne's long lost son Eddie was reunited with her (Rawiri Jobe), this came as a shock to Leanne because she was unsure how he will react as Leanne wasn't there for Eddie growing up. In September 2019, Willy Marsh (Jim Moriarty) who was Leanne's past Ex and Eddie's dad Shocked Eddie and Leanne with a surprise visit. Damo Johnson was concerned that Leanne might get to close to Willy. After spending days together Leanne and Willy were getting closer together. And while Willy was at Leanne's apartment they had Kissed. Leanne couldn't keep it a secret so she had to tell Damo. He was upset but he forgave her. Damo said to Leanne that she must stay away from him. But Damo then caught Leanne and Willy at the I.V together. Leanne was tempted to go upstairs with him, until Damo found them and heard what they were saying. Damo told other friends that him and Leanne are over. But Dawn (Rebekah Palmer) convinced Damo into giving Leanne one more chance. So he went back to their apartment and forgave Leanne one last time until Leanne said that they are over. Little did Damo know that Willy was upstairs in their apartment packing to go away with Leanne. Damo was upset and that was the last of their relationship together. Leanne and WIlly leave Ferndale in September 2019 together to start a new life together she bid farewell to Nicole and grandson Pele and Damo leaving him heartbroken. In January 2020 Leanne returned to Shortland Street. Reception Ludlam highly enjoyed portraying Leanne throughout her first stint as she liked the extremities of Leanne's homophobia and believed it provided an interesting character to play. However upon her second stint that saw Leanne accepting towards Nicole and Maia's relationship, Ludlam believed that the character had been toned down and found portraying the character to be \\"a lot less fun\\". Leanne's mispronunciation of Ula Levi's (Frankie Adams) name as \\"Ew-la\\" became a running joke throughout the cast and crew, with a 2015 scene showing Ula correcting her after many months, receiving much praise by the audience. Karima Madut praised the relationship between Leanne and her character fellow receptionist Clementine Dean, \\"They are a great team, I guess Leanne is more the older, wiser woman and they develop a great relationship. My character looks up to her and she learns to not become more subdued, but she starts to become more thoughtful.\\" The character proved hugely controversial upon her debut April 2010 after several homophobic comments she made were perceived to be insulting the city of Tauranga in suggesting it was not gay friendly. The controversy surrounded Leanne telling Gerald Tippett (Harry McNaughton) that his shirt was \\"too gay\\" for Tauranga. The episode also featured Nicole referring to the city as not being as gay friendly as Auckland. Bay of Plenty Tourism general manager, Tim Burgess believed the show was establishing a \\"negative stereotype,\\" and that the, \\"only positive thing I can say is they were pronouncing Tauranga and Mauao correctly.\\" In response to the episode he referred to the writing team as \\"disappointing and lazy.\\" Burgess also requested an apology. Matthew Denton of the University of Auckland student magazine, Craccum, named Leanne as the shows 5th most annoying character. He attributed this to her blatant homophobia and the irony of this due to her disregard for relationships after attempting to seduce married man Murray Cooper (Matthew Chamberlain). Leanne's homophobia again drew controversy in 2017, with a stuff.co.nz columnist believing it was sending the wrong message to young watchers. Tara Strong of The Spinoff website praised Leanne and Howard's romance and compared them to Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. She believed their wedding episode was a \\"perfect\\" exit for the character.

Carson was mostly known for his political organizing, and his coordination of public demonstrations. These demonstrations protested the education system that African-American communities in New York were subjected to during the 1960s and 70s. He is also known for his popular autobiography, The Education of Sonny Carson (1972), which was made into a 1974 film. Carson is the father of hip-hop artist Professor X. Biography Robert Carson was born on May 22, 1936 in South Carolina, but moved to Brooklyn as a child.Happy Physical Day, Abubadika Sonny Carson In his youth, Carson joined a street gang called the Bishops. Carson was arrested after robbing a Western Union messenger and was sent to a juvenile-detention center. Carson fought in the Korean War with the 82nd Airborne Division, where he claimed to have met a Korean soldier who asked him, \\"Why would a black man fight for a country that would not let you drink from the same water fountain in Mississippi?\\" This pivotal question led Carson to become a community activist after returning to civilian life. Following his return to civilian life, Carson enrolled in college, and for a period of time he returned to involvement in illegal activities. However, he soon began working for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and by 1967 he was the executive director of the Brooklyn CORE. He broke from the organization in 1968, stating that it had not done enough to help African-Americans. Carson's later founded a group called the Committee to Honor Black Heroes. =Kidnapping conviction= In 1974, Carson was convicted of kidnapping. The kidnapping charges, as the New York Times explained, \\"stemmed from what the defense represented as an attempted citizen's arrest of two other men who had twice robbed a black‚Äêowned hotel in Brooklyn's Bedford‚ÄêStuyvesant section.\\" Carson was incarcerated for 15 months in the Sing Sing prison. =Advocate against drug use= In the 1980s Carson became an advocate against drug use, founding a group called \\"Black Men's Movement Against Crack\\". =Protesting police brutality= In the 1980s, Carson organized a number of demonstrations protesting police brutality.

Accessed March 10, 2014. Carson fared poorly in the mainstream press for his racially discriminatory comments. =Family Red Apple boycott= Carson took a central role in organizing the Family Red Apple boycott, also known as the Flatbush boycott. Carson was investigated by the FBI, under the suspicion that he violated the civil rights of the Korean shopkeepers.Kim, Claire Jean. Bitter Fruit: The Politics of Black-Korean Conflict in New York City. Yale University Press. Accessed March 10, 2014. =Accusations of Racism= Carson was charged by his critics for being anti-Semitic. Carson responded, \\"That's absolutely absurd, 'anti-Semitic.' And so that you don't ask the question, I'm antiwhite. Don't limit my antis to just one group of people.\\" Carson was known for leading groups of activists into schools to tell Jewish teachers that, ‚ÄúThe Germans did not do a good enough job with the Jews.‚Äù In his autobiography, The Education of Sonny Carson, however, Carson described successfully working side by side with Americans of Caucasian and Jewish descent during his time in the U.S. Army, the 1960s Civil Rights Movement and the Brooklyn chapter of CORE. =Protest philosophy= Carson's political tactics often involved the use of public protest. His protest philosophy considered disrupting social order to draw attention to the plight of African-Americans. Several of Carson's protests turned violent. In an interview with The New York Times in 1987, Carson said: \\"You don't give us any justice, then there ain't going to be no peace. We're going to use whatever means necessary to make sure that everyone is disrupted in their normal life.\\" =The Dinkins campaign= Carson was the subject of media scrutiny in 1989, following speculations that the Dinkins mayoral campaign provided payments to Carson. The purpose of the payments was claimed to be either for a \\"get out of vote\\" drive organized by Carson, or, as critics maintained, for the assurance that Carson would refrain from staging protests during the campaign. Carson denied keeping campaign funds.Dinkins Worker Says he used Campaign money in Vote Effort. The New York Times. Accessed March 10, 2014. David Dinkins released a statement apologizing for involving Carson in his campaign. Following one of Carson's \\"Anti-White\\" statements, Dinkins released a public statement critical of Carson stating: \\"Sonny Carson's comment represents the kind of bigotry and intolerance I utterly reject and have fought against my whole life. Had such comments come to my attention, he never would have played a role in my campaign.\\"  Health Issues and Death  A few months before December 2002, Carson suffered two heart attacks and became comatose. He was admitted to the Manhattan Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where he remained until his death on December 20, 2002, at the age of 66.

Towards the latter part of his decades-long career, Morrison traveled the world introducing the lamp and promoting its use.  Early life  George Francis Morrison was born on February 22, 1867 in Wellsville, New York. His father William Morrison was born in County Clare, Ireland and worked as a teamster. His mother Susan Maguire was also from Ireland. The Morrisons initially settled in Harrison, New Jersey, where George's three older sisters Elizabeth, Mary Ann, and Margaret were born. William moved the family to the Wellsville area before George was born, most likely because of the perceived fortunes promised by the nascent crude oil industry in western New York. After ten years and the marriages of George's sisters Mary Ann and Elizabeth, the family returned to Harrison.  Career  Dr. Irving Langmuir and Thomas Edison examining a vacuum tube. Morrison began his career in the summer of 1882 at Edison Lamp Works in Harrison when he was 15 years old. He was hired to unwrap and smooth tissue paper from incandescent light bulbs that arrived from the Corning Glass Works in Corning, New York so that they could be reused in packaging finished lamps. He was paid one and two-thirds cents per hour, equating to only one dollar per week if he worked sixty hours. He continued to perform other basic tasks at the plant but did them very well, which did not go unnoticed and created opportunities for advancement. A graduate of New Jersey Business College in Newark, Morrison was soon promoted to foreman and became associated with Thomas Edison in his experimental lamp testing department. After a few more promotions, Morrison then took charge of the instrument standardization department and eventually became the general foremen of the plant. He was promoted again to Plant Superintendent and then became the General Manager of all of GE's plants by 1903. In January 1917, Morrison was elected as a Vice President of General Electric Company (GE) and in February 1918Electric Club, Westinghouse Club, \\"The Electric journal, Volume 14\\" he became one of the original members of the Association of Edison Pioneers Several innovations during this time, such as the development of tungsten filaments, allowed brighter and longer-lasting bulbs, with production steadily increasing throughout the ensuing years. Morrison was instrumental in the expansion of GE's lamp business and took a leading role in establishing strong relationships with other lamp manufacturers, both domestically and abroad, which ultimately led to standardization within the industry. He was known for having good judgement and being able to see both sides of an issue and arrive to accurate conclusions. He was said to have never made an enemy throughout his career and became close personal friends with all of his business associates. As an executive, Morrison ensured the management and enforcement of GE's patents. On April 28, 1926 Morrison wrote to Gerard Swope, president of GE at the time, to bring attention to the early expiration of three vital patents covering the tungsten lamp, upon which GE's market share virtually completely rested. Morrison went on to acknowledge that cross-patent licensing agreements with Westinghouse, GE's largest lamp manufacturing competitor, was essential to prevent other competitors from gaining share of General Electric's markets.George Ward Stocking, Myron Webster Watkins. \\"Cartels in Action, Case Studies in International Business Diplomacy\\", Towards the latter part of his career, Morrison began traveling around the world looking after GE's foreign interests, as well as to introduce and promote the incandescent lamp. Among the countries he visited were England, France, Russia, Japan, and China. He met Joseph Stalin in Russia, and after introducing the lamp in Japan, Emperor Taish≈ç bestowed upon him the Order of the Rising Sun. Morrison was also the chairman of the board of directors of the Sprague Electric Company and a director of the Intertype Corporation.Frank H. Lancaster, Ernest F. Birmingham, \\"The Fourth estate: a weekly newspaper for advertisers and newspaper makers\\", 1920, He served on the board of directors of both General Electric and International General Electric from 1922 to 1942 and was honorary Vice President at the time of his death in 1943.

Erben  Family  George and his wife Jennie had seven children, Blanche, Jennie, Flora, Beatrice, Georgina, George Jr., and Franklin. He assisted his brother-in-law John Graves, his sister Mary Ann's husband, in obtaining a trucking license in New Jersey after moving to Harrison from Wellsville. Graves eventually built a trucking business called Graves Trucking that maintained a number of large accounts, including that of RCA Corporation. George also did his best to secure jobs for his unemployed family members during the Great Depression. In one instance, he found his niece Dorothy Graves O'Brien a job at the Edison Lamp Works carrying trays of light bulbs from one work station to another. Morrison was the uncle of western film legend George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes, the son of his older sister Elizabeth Morrison and Clark Hayes. Morrison's daughter Georgina was the second wife of William C. Krueger, president of Gottfried Krueger Brewing Company and son of its founder, Gottfried Krueger. Morrison died on October 21, 1943 in his home in East Orange, New Jersey at the age of 76.

Life James, son of Thomas Thompson, proprietor of the Leicester Chronicle, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of John Garton of Halstead, Leicestershire, was born at Leicester on 6 December 1817. He received his education first at a school kept by Mr. Creaton of Billesdon, and then under Charles Berry, minister of the Great Meeting at Leicester. He followed his father's profession of journalist, as a reporter, and then assisting in the editorial department. He soon became an able leader-writer, and for more than thirty years wrote nearly all the leading articles of the Leicester Chronicle, the chief liberal paper in Leicestershire, which had belonged to his father since 1813. In 1841 Thompson became joint proprietor of the Chronicle with his father, and sole proprietor in 1864. In the same year he purchased the copyright of the Leicestershire Mercury, which he merged with the Leicester Chronicle. In politics he was a liberal and a reformer. He worked actively for the abolition of the corn laws and of church rates, and for the extension of the electoral franchise. For some time he was a member of the town council of Leicester; and he was one of the founders of the Mechanics' Institute there, and honorary curator of the Leicester Museum. Works Thompson in early life took a keen interest in the study of archaeology and antiquities. He began by publishing in his journal a series of Passages from the History of Leicester. In 1847, in conjunction with William Kelly, he arranged the ancient manuscripts which were lying in a state of disorder in the Leicester corporation muniment-room. In 1849 he brought out a History of Leicester, from the time of the Romans to the end of the Seventeenth Century. This, his largest and most important work, was the fruit of much original research. In 1854‚Äì6 he edited the Midland Counties Historical Collector, of which only two volumes appeared. In 1867 he published An Essay on English Municipal History, a work which threw much new light on the origin, institution, and development of municipal government in Leicester and other ancient English towns. The manuscripts of the ancient merchant guild of Leicester gave him a mass of original materials for this book, which is referred to by John Richard Green and other writers (cf. Mrs. J. R. Green's Town Life in the Fifteenth Century, 1894, i. 235 seq.). In 1871 he issued a History of Leicester in the Eighteenth Century, supplementary to his earlier history. Thompson was one of the founders of the Leicestershire Architectural and Arch√¶ological Society in 1855, and to its Transactions he contributed numerous papers and communications. He was also local secretary of the Society of Antiquaries, a member of the British Arch√¶ological Association, and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society. To Notes and Queries he was a frequent contributor, under the signature of \\"Jaytee\\". He died at his residence, Dannett House, Fosse Road, Leicester, on 20 May 1877, and was buried on 24 May in the Leicester cemetery. He married at St. Martin's, Leicester, on 24 June 1847, Janet Bissett, daughter of John McAlpin of Leicester, but left no issue. His widow died on 29 Oct. 1879.

For instance, women may not be considered a good fit for a managerial position if being aggressive is seen as a characteristic of a successful manager. Due to stereotype fit, men may be considered more qualified for the position and are not only more likely to be hired, but are also more likely to be promoted as well. Empirical evidence =Women and the workplace= The stereotype fit hypothesis was developed by HeilmanHeilman, M. (2001). \\"Description and prescription: How gender stereotypes prevent women's ascent up the organizational ladder\\". Journal of Social Issues, Gender, Hierarchy, and Leadership 57 (4): 657-674. in order to evaluate the current role of women in high-power positions in the workplace.Whitley, B.E. & Kite, M.E. (2010). The psychology of prejudice and discrimination. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth, 2006, pp. 394, 397, . Since Heilman's initial research, many studies have been conducted to determine how women are affected by job positions which are considered to be more masculine. For example, Lyness & Heilman (2006)Lyness K.S., & Heilman, M. E. (2006). \\"When fit is fundamental: Performance evaluations and promotions of upper- level female and male managers\\". Journal of Applied Psychology, 91 (4): 777-785. utilized archival organizational data from a multinational finances company to study the effects of stereotype fit on performance evaluations and promotions. Their study found upper-level female managers were rated more negatively than men in similar or lower positions and females in lower management positions. The authors also found that out of those promoted, females received more favorable ratings than their male counterparts - suggesting a more stringent threshold for promotion for women (see shifting standards). In a similar study by Eagly & Karau (2002),Eagly, A.H., & Karau, S.J. (2002). \\"Role congruity theory of prejudice toward female leaders\\". Psychological Review 109 (3): 573-598. because of male-manager stereotypes, women are seen as less likely to fit managerial roles and, as a result, when they do achieve those positions, are looked on less favorably when performing the same managerial duties. The stigma of women in the workplace, however, is not set in stone. According to a study by Heilman (2001), women have made considerable progress in attaining managerial positions, but there are still obstacles in the way of organizational equality; if there is any uncertainty about their skills, women are still likely to be viewed as incompetent or socially rejected. Race and the workplace The stereotype fit hypothesis, however, is not only confined to gender. Researchers have also studied the effect of racial and ethnical characteristics on job acquisition and placement in leadership roles. For example, in a study conducted by Rosette, Phillips and Leonardelli (2008),Rosette, A. S., Phillips, K. W., & Leonardelli, G. J. (2008). \\"The white standard: racial bias in leader categorization\\". Journal of Applied Psychology 93(4): 777-758. participants were asked to read an article about a fictitious business project involving either a racially ambiguous \\"leader\\" of the project or an \\"employee\\" working on the project. Leaders were assumed to be White more often than non-leaders - suggesting a congruity exists between the white stereotype and the leadership prototype. This suggests that stereotype fit is just as applicable when using race or ethnicity as a guideline for placement in the workforce. An additional effect of the stereotype fit hypothesis includes rewarding certain groups over others. Studies conducted by Steele and Ambady (2004)Steele, J., & Ambady, N. (2004, January). \\"Unintended discrimination and preferential treatment through category activation in a mock job interview\\". Paper presented at the meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Austin, TX. show that when Asian women were considered for job placement as a computer technician, if the participant's Asian identity was salient over their identity as a female, they were more likely to be given a better recommendation and starting pay.

(received 26 August 1977; in final form, 17 October 1977) A Pair of fast-acting movable limiters are to be installed in the vacuum chamber of the JT-60 tokamak being designed at JAERI.Their purpose is to suppress skin current in the plasma column. They should traval across are vacuum chamber over a stroke of about 1 m in 0.1 s during the built-up phase of the plasma current. Each movable limiter system consists of the drive system, a vacuum seal, a bearing usable at high temperature in a vacuum, and a molybdenum rail limiter head. For the drive a hydraulic mechanism is used with servovalves to control the oil flow. To develop satisfactory movable limiters for JT-60, the full-scale model was constructed and tested. Overall tests with the model showed high reliability, reproducibility, controllability, and safety of the movable limiter. The drive pattern measured is in good agreement with that simulated. The movable limiters should prevent the skin effect of plasma current in the current rising phase and also provide information on particle diffusion during the flat-top phase of plasma current. * 1995 Mystery Writers of Japan Member * 2000 Japan Writer's Association Member * 2001 National Coaching School Cooperative Society Director * 2007 Filmize Midnight Eagle (Shochiku-Universal Pictures) reviewed by Matt Zoller Seitz in The New York Times (23 November 2007)).

The film aired in three parts on the PBS series Frontline in September 1998. Plot =Part 1= Part 1 of The Farmer's Wife recounts the moving story of Juanita and Darrel Buschkoetter's romantic love affair and begins the journey to the core of their emotional struggles, which have pushed their marriage to the brink. David Sutherland eschews the use of a narrator in this film, allowing Darrel and Juanita tell their own story in their own words, without the intrusion of a narrator, and to let the story play out on its own. =Part 2= In Part 2, the camera focuses on the rhythms of everyday life on the Buschkoetters' farm. The film follows Juanita, Darrel, and their three daughters through days reminiscent of a forgotten, simpler time in America. Difficulties arise, however: In September, an early frost destroys 30% of their crop. The loss forces Darrel to go to work at a nearby farm (making $7/hour in return), while he farms his own land at night. Juanita, meanwhile, cleans houses while trying to get a college degree so Darrel can stay home and farm. Darrel, however, worries that if Juanita goes off the farm, she'll find a job and life she likes better. By Christmas, the family is dead broke and unsure of their future. =Part 3= In the concluding episode, Darrel finally harvests the bumper crop he had dreamt about his whole life. It's not quite enough, however, as Darrel has to work for another farmer just to make enough money to feed his family. The resulting stress and exhaustion cause him to explode, prompting Juanita to take their daughters and leave the farm for a week. The move has a deep and profound effect on Darrel. Two months later, through counseling, Darrel learns to manage his anger and undergoes extraordinary personal growth. Darrel agrees to be the at-home parent, farming and caring for his three daughters while Juanita, college degree in hand, works at a respected crop insurance company in order to help other struggling farmers. In the end, through faith, hope, and hard work, the Buschkoetters save their farm and rediscover the love that holds them together.

Jacob, eldest son of Merrick Thompson, a manufacturer of linen check and a well-known member of the Society of Friends, was born in Lanton Street, Penrith, Cumberland, on 28 August 1806. His father was then in prosperous circumstances, but the depression of trade caused by the War of 1812 brought about his failure. Young Thompson's aspirations to become an artist met with little sympathy from his family, and he was apprenticed to a house-painter; but he struggled with energy and perseverance against these adverse influences, and devoted all his leisure time to his favourite pursuit. He at length attracted the notice of Lord Lonsdale, and with his help he came in 1829 to London with an introduction to Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769‚Äì1830), and became a student at the British Museum and the Royal Academy. \\"The Day's Bag\\" He began to exhibit in 1824, when he had in the first exhibition of the Society of British Artists a \\"View in Cumberland,\\" but he did not send a picture to the Royal Academy until 1832, in which year appeared \\"The Druids cutting down the Mistletoe.\\" This was followed in 1833 by a picture containing full-length portraits of the daughters of the Hon. Colonel Lowther. His next exhibit was \\"Harvest Home in the Fourteenth Century,\\" which appeared at the British Institution in 1837, and was presented by the artist to his patron, the Earl of Lonsdale. After this date he painted portraits, views of mansions, &c.;, but he did not exhibit again until 1847, when he sent to Westminster Hall \\"The Highland Ferry-Boat,\\" which was engraved in line by James Tibbits Willmore. \\"The Proposal\\" appeared at the Royal Academy in 1848; \\"The Highland Bride,\\" likewise engraved by Willmore, in 1851; \\"Going to Church: Scene in the Highlands,\\" in 1852; \\"The Hope Beyond,\\" in 1853; \\"The Course of true Love never did run smooth,\\" in 1854; \\"The Mountain Ramblers,\\" in 1855; \\"Sunny Hours of Childhood\\" and \\"Looking out for the Homeward Bound,\\" in 1856; and \\"The Pet Lamb,\\" in 1857. He painted in 1858 \\"Crossing a Highland Loch,\\" which was engraved by Charles Mottram; but he did not again exhibit until 1860, when he sent to the Royal Academy \\"The Signal,\\" which was engraved by Charles Cousen for the Art Journal of 1862. In 1864 he had at the academy \\"The Height of Ambition,\\" engraved by Charles Cousen for the Art Journal, as was likewise by J. C. Armytage \\"Drawing the Net at Hawes Water,\\" painted in 1867 for Lord Esher, but never exhibited. \\"Rush Bearing\\" and a view of Rydal Mount are among his best works. In his later years Thompson devoted himself chiefly to landscape subjects with figures, the themes of which were for the most part drawn from the mountains and lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland, but occasionally from Scotland. His range, however, was limited, and his work was lacking in poetic sympathy. His attempts at classical and scriptural subjects, such as \\"Acis and Galatea,\\" exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1849, and \\"Proserpine,\\" were not a success. His last work was \\"Eldmuir, or Solitude.\\" Thompson died at the Hermitage, Hackthorpe, Cumberland, where he had lived in retirement for upwards of forty years, on 27 December 1879, and was buried in Lowther churchyard. His first wife was a sister of George Parker Bidder, the celebrated calculator and civil engineer. A portrait of Thompson, drawn on wood by himself, and engraved by W. Ballingall, is prefixed to his Life by Llewellyn Jewitt.

Along with Santiago Omar Riveros, he was one of the last two surviving () members of the dictatorship. On 8 September 2016 he was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment for crimes during the dictatorship. Life and times Graffigna was born in rural Clarke, Santa Fe Province. He graduated from the School of Military Aviation, and became Chief of Staff of the Argentine Air Force after the March 1976 coup. He initiated the C√≥ndor missile program during his tenure as Air Force Chief of Staff, and in 1978, the C√≥ndor I sounding rocket was converted into a tactical missile, albeit without a sophisticated guidance system.Argentina: Missile Chronology He succeeded General Orlando Agosti as Commander of the Air Force in January 1979, and continued Agosti's policy of having the post serve as a moderating counterweight to the hard-line Navy stance.

Trials and imprisonment Graffigna was indicted for kidnapping, torture, robbery, invasion of property and forgery of public documents during the historic Trial of the Juntas in 1985. His case benefited from a ruling during the sentencing phase of the trial that punishment should be determined by the relative roles of each branch of the Argentine Armed Forces in each case, thereby lessening sentences for the Air Force commanders on trial. Graffigna and his successor, General Basilio Lami Dozo, were acquitted of all charges.Ciancaglini, Sergio, and Granovsky, Mart√≠n. Nada m√°s que la verdad: el juicio a las juntas. Buenos Aires: Planeta, 1995. In 2003 Graffigna was ordered arrested again by Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral pursuant to a request for his extradition to Spain by Judge Baltazar Garz√≥n on the charge of crimes against humanity.Clar√≠n (13 Apr 2006) Prime Minister Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar of Spain decided that extraditions to Spain of those implicated in crimes during the Argentine dictatorship were now unwarranted, as Argentina had repealed an amnesty absolving those involved of responsibility for crimes, so that they could now be dealt with in Argentina. In 2005, however, the Supreme Court of Spain annulled the Prime Minister's decision and ordered that extradition proceedings begin.La Naci√≥n Graffigna and Lami Dozo unsuccessfully petitioned the Argentine Federal Court for a habeas corpus ruling for what they maintained was a lack of jurisdiction on the part of Spanish courts. On 8 September 2016 Graffigna was sentenced in Argentina to 25 years' imprisonment for the abduction, torture and murder of the married couple Patricia Roisinblit and Jos√© Manuel P√©rez Rojo in 1978 by the air force's Buenos Aires Regional Intelligence (RIBA). Roisinblit was 8 months pregnant; her child was born and given to air force intelligence operative Francisco G√≥mez (sentenced to 12 years in prison for his part) and his wife Teodora Jofre to raise as their own. Roisinblit and P√©rez Rojo were never seen again. Luis Trillo, the head of RIBA, was sentenced to 25 years for the murder. Before sentencing Graffigna made no reference to the crimes, but said that he had behaved in an entirely professional way in the last six years of his career.

It was taken from their album The Fabulous Miracles, and was the follow-up to the group's million-selling Grammy Hall of Fame inducted tune, \\"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\\". The first of three singles released by The Miracles that year, this song was a Billboard Top 40 Pop Hit, peaking at #31, and missed the Top 20 of its R&B; chart by only one position, peaking at # 21. Written and produced by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, \\"A Love She Can Count On\\" features the same bluesy sound and feel of \\"Hold On Me\\", featuring the gospel-inspired harmonies of Miracles members Bobby Rogers, Claudette Robinson, Pete Moore, and Ronnie White, and, like that previous song, begins with the guitar of Miracles member Marv Tarplin. However, that is where the similarities end; unlike the previous hit, with its theme of being in love with someone you don't like, \\"A Love She Can Count On\\" has as its theme undying love and loyalty, with Robinson, as the song's narrator, promising eternal love and devotion: *Every day ... *I'm gonna love you, come what may *'Cause I know that there is nothing that means more *To a woman, *than A Love That She Can Count On. The other Miracles participate in a sing-along call and response with Smokey on the song's bridge, similar to the song that, according to Smokey, inspired both this song and \\"Hold On Me\\", Sam Cooke's 1962 hit \\"Bring It On Home to Me\\". The single and album versions of this song are noticeably different, the album version of \\"A Love She Can Count On\\" featuring a bluesy piano style as was done by its predecessor \\"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\\". For the most part the piano was deleted from the single version, not being featured as prominently. It also features a completely different vocal take. Unlike almost all other singles from The Miracles, and indeed many other songs by the group, \\"A Love She Can Count On\\" has not yet been covered by major acts. This was also the case with the B-side of the single, \\"I Can Take A Hint\\", despite the fact that it was also a chart hit, reaching #107 on the Billboard Pop chart. \\"A Love She Can Count On\\" appears on several Miracles \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections, including their album Greatest Hits from the Beginning, and their 2009 two-CD set, The Miracles‚ÄìDepend On Me: The Early Albums (which features both live and studio versions). The Miracles also performed a special extended version of the song on their first live album, 1963's The Miracles Recorded Live on Stage.

The Club then moved to its present location at King's Park along Gascoigne Road. The hotel was formerly named Hotel Miramar. It opened in 1948, with 32 rooms, as Hong Kong's first post-war hotel. A major expansion in 1953 added 160 new rooms. It was purchased in 1957 from a Spanish mission by the founders of Miramar Hotel and Investment Company, Limited. A new wing was built in two phases, increasing the number of rooms to 380 by 1973. The grand opening of the rebranded and redesigned hotel took place on September 17, 2009.

He would later join the Wisconsin Army National Guard and serve as an instructor before joining the 54th Infantry Regiment. In April 1924 he transferred to the United States Army Air Service. He was later sent to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study aeronautical engineering. During World War II he held command of the 44th Bombardment Group, the 98th Bombardment Group, the 15th Wing, and the 47th Bombardment Wing. Following his service in the war he was given command of the 17th Bomb Operational Training Wing and VIII Bomber Command before being named the Commanding General of Keesler Field in 1946. Later assignments included holing command of the 301st Fighter Wing. He would become a member of the Air Force after its inception in 1947. In 1948 he was given the command of the 51st Fighter Wing, promoted as Major General in 1950 and retired from the USAF in 1951.http://www.generals.dk/general/Rush/Hugo_Peoples/USA.html Awards he received include the Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters.

Allometric shifts will increase the overall variation in one trait relative to the other breaking their typical correlation Allometric engineering is the process of experimentally shifting the scaling relationships, for body size or shape, in a population of organisms. More specifically, the process of experimentally breaking the tight covariance evident among component traits of a complex phenotype by altering the variance of one trait relative to another. Typically, body size is one of the two traits. The measurements of the two traits are plotted against each other and the scaling relationship can be represented as: log(y) = mlog(x) + log(b) . Manipulations of this sort alter the scaling relationships either by shifting the intercept (b), slope (m) or both to create novel variants (see: Allometry, for more details). These novel variants can then be tested for differences in performance or fitness. Through careful testing, one could sequentially test each component of a trait suite to determine how each part contributes to the function of the entire complex phenotype, and ultimately the fitness of the organism. This technique allows for comparison within or among biological groups differing in size by adjusting morphology to match one another and comparing their performances. Examples and application =Lack's hypothesis= Allometric engineering has been used to test David Lack's hypothesis in the lizard Sceloporus occidentalis. In this study, two populations were \\"engineered\\" to fit the morphology of the other by manipulating egg yolk quantity, removing effect of size difference between groups. After manipulation, they found that speed was inversely proportional to body size. =Nature versus nurture= Maternal investment was \\"allometrically engineered\\" by surgically removing an ovary in cockroaches (Diploptera punctata). This effectively reduced number of progeny and increased resource allocation to each offspring. They coupled this manipulation with group effects (faster development in large groups), and found that maternal investment can overcome group effect. =Sexual selection= The male long-tailed widowbird (Euplectes progne) has exceptionally long tail feathers roughly half a meter in length. Male tail feathers were cropped and glued and those with artificially enhanced tail lengths secured the most matings, demonstrating female preference. =Natural selection= The fly Zonosemata vittigera has a banding pattern on its wings that was found to mimic movements of a jumping spider. Greene et al. engineered novel phenotypes, breaking correlation between a behavior and morphology, by cutting and transplanting the wings of this fly with the common housefly. see: Tephritid fly. This manipulation demonstrated that it was behavior coupled with the banding pattern that deterred jumping spiders from attacking, though not other predators. Methods Current uses have involved truncation or cropping, yolk manipulation, hormonal treatments, maternal allocation, temperature manipulation, or altering the nutritional states. Each method undoubtedly has its merits and pitfalls to consider before designing an experiment, but these techniques are opening new avenues of research in comparative and evolutionary biology.

The blue and yellow striped cat first appeared on a school calendar in 1971 with a storyline that he had lost eight of his nine lives due to \\"ignorance of road safety practices\\". This was followed by a short instructional film. In subsequent years other characters were introduced in calendars, instructional films, and comic books including Millie, his girlfriend (1973), Uncle Tom (1974), Hector and Millie's three kittens (1975) and his space friend Ding Dong (1982). A study in 1978 found that, although children enjoyed the characters and stories, the material had a number of inadequacies. It stressed that road safety research findings and child development theory would need to be considered for any future development.

The Hebrew name is Hellenised as Symeon () in the Septuagint, and in the New Testament as both Symeon in Strong's Concordance and, according to most authorities, Simon. Some commentators on the New Testament say that it could be a Hellenised form of the Hebrew Shim'on, but if not then it indicates that Peter came from a \\"Hellenistic background\\"; this was not unheard of in this era, as contemporary Jews such as Andrew the Apostle sometimes bore originally Greek names. Simon is one Latinised version of the name, the others being Simeon or Symeon. This practice carried over into English: in the King James Version, the name Simeon Niger is spelt Simeon (Acts 13:1) as is Simeon (Gospel of Luke) (), while Peter is called Simon ().

It is also called Conradina montana or Cumberland rosemary. It has been classified as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act since 1991.  Physical characteristics  Cumberland rosemary is a shrub which grows about 50 cm high. It has needle-like leaves with an aromatic scent that resembles rosemary. Its flowers are lavender, purple, and more rarely, white. They are 1-2 cm long, with darker spots in the center. In profile, the flowers may have an ‚ÄúS‚Äù shape due to the curving of the floral cup. Cumberland rosemary has a bilabiate calyx, 7-9 mm long, with a glandular- hairy surface. It may be hard to distinguish individual Cumberland rosemary plants by eye. What looks like separate plants can actually be one sprawling plant. This is because Cumberland rosemary‚Äôs stems fall over when they grow higher than 30 cm. These horizontal branches will root at the nodes and grow new (vertical) stems. Because the plant lives in a gravelly environment with periodic flooding, sand and rocks can cover up these horizontal connections. When it is not flowering, Cumberland rosemary may resemble other plants with needlelike leaves such as Aster linariifolius, Hypericum densiflorum, and Pycnanthemum tenuifolium. However, none of these other plants have a rosemary aroma.  Life history and reproduction  Cumberland rosemary flowers from the middle of May to early June. The flower initially produces pollen for up to a day before the female parts become receptive. It is mainly pollinated by bumblebees and honeybees. Unpollinated flowers will last for a week. Pollinated flowers will fall off in two days. Seeds mature in the middle of June. They are dark brown and 1 mm in diameter. Various studies report low seed viability. Roulston (1994) found that less than 10% of seeds germinate. A later study by Albrecht and Penago (2012) reported a higher percentage of 26%. The poor seed development may be attributed to the Cumberland rosemary‚Äôs clonal nature. Pollinating insects transport pollen between nearby flowers, which are actually the same genetic individual. However, even with outcrossing, seed viability remains low. The germination process takes two weeks, and it more likely to happen in warmer temperatures. Cumberland rosemary is only triploid species in the Conradina genus.  Habitat  Cumberland rosemary lives on the rocky river banks of the Cumberland Plateau. It grows best in full sunlight and in well-drained soil with no visible organic matter. The soil may be mostly sand, or sand mixed with gravel. Thus, it also benefits from topographic features which enhance sand deposition. It relies on periodic flooding to eliminate taller plants which might leave Cumberland rosemary in the shade. Extended flooding may induce rooting at the lower stem nodes and disperse seeds and viable plant fragments downstream. It has been hypothesized Cumberland rosemary may thrive with alternating floods and extreme droughts, as this regime helps eliminate competition, but data is lacking on this. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not designate a critical habitat for Cumberland rosemary at the time of its federal listing. The plant‚Äôs locations are isolated and visitors are unlikely to stumble upon them. Announcing a critical habitat might attract collectors, or curious locals who might unknowingly cause damage. FWS stated that they would contact private landowners who have colonies of Cumberland rosemary growing on their property.  Range and population  Cumberland rosemary is only found in the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee and Kentucky. At the time of its federal listing in 1991, there were three populations in Tennessee: one along the South Fork Cumberland River, one along the Caney Fork River, and one along the Obed River system. In total, there were 44 known colonies. The population in Kentucky is also along the South Fork Cumberland River, and had four colonies. In 1996, it was reported that there were 79 colonies in Tennessee and 12 in Kentucky. In 2010, observers were able to count a total of 60 colonies. In 2017, number of colonies was 66.  History of ESA listing  Cumberland rosemary was first collected by Albert Ruth in 1894. In 1933, H.M. Jennison named the plant Conradina verticillata. 7 months later, J.K. Small named the plant Conradina montana. The Endangered Species Act was signed in 1973. In 1975, The Smithsonian Institution included Cumberland Rosemary in a review of threatened, endangered, or extinct plant species. FWS funded a survey of the plant in Tennessee and Kentucky from 1979 to 1981, and declared Cumberland rosemary as a category 1 species, meaning that the agency has enough information to classify it as endangered or threatened. (This category is now outdated, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses ‚Äúcandidate species‚Äù instead.) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officially proposed Cumberland rosemary as ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù in January 1991. It was federally listed in November 1991. A recovery plan was published in 1996. In Tennessee, the plant was listed as endangered in 1985. It does not have legal protection in Kentucky.  Major threats  The biggest threat faced by Cumberland rosemary is habitat degradation affecting the rivers. For instance, the construction of Wolf Creek Dam in Kentucky extirpated one population. Dams can impact Cumberland rosemary in two ways: either by permanently flooding its habitat, or by altering the natural flood regime. Without flooding, the plant is unable to compete with taller plants for sunlight. Also, nearby coal mining can affect the water quality by making it more acidic. Cumberland rosemary can be found in the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area, a popular site for camping, hiking, and white water-rafting. Visitors may unknowingly damage the plant, especially with off-road vehicles. In recent years, invasive exotic species such as tree-of-heaven and mimosa have threatened the population in the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area. The National Park Service designated various sites‚Äîsome of which overlap with the Cumberland rosemary population‚Äîto control these invasive species. While the specific impact of these invasive species on Cumberland rosemary is unknown, it is likely that they leave Cumberland rosemary in the shade and hinder its growth. Cumberland rosemary is also considered moderately vulnerable to the effects of climate change.  Conservation efforts  According to the 1996 recovery plan, Cumberland rosemary will be considered for delisting when there are five protected colonies on five rivers for a total of 25 colonies. Each colony must have 50 genetically distinct individuals. The five rivers are: Big South Fork Cumberland River, Caney Fork River, and Obed River, along with its tributaries, Clear Creek and Daddy‚Äôs Creek. The recovery plan predicted a completion date of 2005, but as of 2018 Cumberland Rosemary is still considered threatened. In 1993, Cumberland rosemary was being propagated ex situ at the North Carolina Arboretum and some other nurseries in the southeastern US. As of 2018, NCA only has seeds in storage. Although much of Cumberland rosemary's population is found on National Park Service land, there have not been changes made to the trails on BSFNRRA to guide visitors away from the plant. But there is also unclear data on the severity of human impact; most of it is anecdotal.

It was Hartford- Davis‚Äô penultimate film before his death in 1977.  Plot summary  In Los Angeles, a nighttime robbery of an illegal mafia bookmaking operation is carried out by the militant African-American organization BAG (Black Action Group). Though successful, several of the bookmakers and one of the burglars are killed. The mastermind behind the robbery, a Vietnam veteran named Scott, is the brother of a prominent nightclub owner, Gunn. Seeking safe haven, Scott hides out at his brother's mansion after a brief reunion. Meanwhile, mafia caporegime and used-car dealer Russ Capelli (Martin Landau) meets with a female West Coast crime boss, Toni Lombardo, to report the theft of daily payoff records and monies. Though Capelli receives an unrelated promotion for years of loyal service, he nonetheless fears the consequences of a loss of face and status as well as incriminating mob financial information. He therefore orders his men, led by psychotic assassin Ray Kriley , to shake down anyone who might have a connection to the robbery and to recover the lost goods using any means necessary.  Cast   Release  The film was released theatrically in the United States by Columbia Pictures in December 1972. The film was given a VHS release by Goodtimes Home Video in the United States. It was later released on DVD in 2004 via Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. This release is anamorphic in 1.85:1 aspect ratio.

It was recorded during the sessions that would in 1975 be released on The Basement Tapes but was not included on that album. These sessions took place in three phases throughout the year, at a trio of houses, and \\"Santa-Fe\\" was likely put on tape in the second of these, at a home of some of the Band members, known as Big Pink. The composition, which has been characterized as a \\"nonsense\\" song, was copyrighted in 1973 with lyrics that differ noticeably from those on the recording itself. In the decades following this collaboration, the over 100 tracks recorded at these sessions were at different stages obtained by collectors and released on bootlegs. The first batch of these leaked to the public beginning in the late 1960s; the second in 1986; the third, which included \\"Santa-Fe\\", in the early 1990s; and a fourth batch of Basement Tape tracks became public in 2014. The song was released officially on the Columbia album The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961‚Äì1991. It has been subject to mixed opinions by critics and biographers, with some praising it for its expressiveness, and others regarding it unmemorable, while criticizing its inclusion on The Bootleg Series at the expense of more worthy candidates. Background =Recording near Woodstock= \\"Santa-Fe\\" is believed to have been recorded at Big Pink, West Saugerties, New York, shown here in 2006 In 1965 and 1966, Dylan was touring with the Hawks‚ÄîRick Danko, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel, Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm, although Helm quit the group in late November or early December 1965. In July 1966, Dylan suffered a motorcycle accident and spent several months recuperating at his house in Byrdcliffe, near Woodstock, New York. By spring 1967, all of the members of the Hawks, except Helm, had joined Dylan in the Woodstock area, with Danko, Manuel and Hudson living in nearby West Saugerties in a house nicknamed Big Pink. Dylan and the four Hawks began recording informal music sessions, first at Dylan's house in what was known as \\"the Red Room\\", followed by the basement of Big Pink. Earlier on they recorded mostly covers and traditional music, but later moved onto original material written largely by Dylan. In total, over 100 songs and alternate takes were put on tape. Helm returned to the group in October 1967 and performed on some final Woodstock-area collaborations between Dylan and the Hawks, these ones at a different house that some group members had moved to. In the fall of that year, the Hawks, who soon renamed themselves the Band, continued writing and rehearsing songs for their debut album, Music From Big Pink. Dylan biographer Sid Griffin has noted that, because no written records were kept of these 1967 recording sessions, \\"the world will have to live with the fact that it will never know exactly which Basement Tapes tune was recorded when and where\\". Nonetheless, using clues such as the sound quality of different batches of songs, and where they appear on the original reels of tapes, attempts have been made to place the songs into a rough chronology and guess the locations at which they were likely recorded. Biographer Clinton Heylin places \\"Santa-Fe\\" in the summer of 1967 at Big Pink. The liner notes of The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3 date it in the fall of that year. Griffin lists it among the probable Big Pink recordings, and in a group of songs from around July, but concedes it is also \\"unlikely [but] possible\\" it came from the Red Room. =Circulation of Basement Tape songs= In late 1967, an acetate of fourteen of Dylan's compositions was made, from which demos circulated among music groups who might be interested in recording some of the songs. Artists including Peter, Paul and Mary, Manfred Mann and the Byrds eventually did. Dylan's demo tapes were soon heard by music journalists, including Rolling Stone's Jann Wenner, who wrote a front-page story in that magazine entitled \\"Dylan's Basement Tape Should Be Released\\". This made the general public hungry to hear the music, and in July 1969 a bootleg called Great White Wonder, which included some of the Big Pink songs, came out. Other Basement Tape bootlegs followed. In 1975, the Columbia album The Basement Tapes was compiled, mainly by Robertson and engineer Rob Fraboni. Robertson and Fraboni put thirty-five of the songs onto composite reels of tape, and Heylin believes these represented a short list of candidates for the album. \\"Santa-Fe\\" was included on these composite reels, but was not ultimately chosen for the album. The Basement Tapes included sixteen Dylan songs recorded at Big Pink in 1967, as well as eight Band demos from various times and locations between 1967 and 1975. One Dylan song on the album, \\"Goin' to Acapulco\\", had not appeared on his 1967 fourteen-song acetate or on bootlegs, and this alerted the world to the possibility that there might be more Basement Tape songs in existence. In 1986, at least twenty-five previously unknown 1967 songs by Dylan and the Band passed into collectors' hands by way of a former roadie of the Band's. In the early 1990s, a third batch of songs, these ones from Garth Hudson's archives, came to light around the time Columbia was preparing The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3; \\"Santa-Fe\\" comes from this group. In his liner notes for The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3, John Bauldie commented on these second and third stages in which groups of Big Pink songs had come to light: \\"Despite the ... emergence [in 1986] in collectors' circles of a further couple of hours of Basement Tapes, it seems as though there's a good deal left unheard. 'Santa-Fe' is just one example of a batch of previously unsuspected Basement tracks\\". By 1992, the \\"Santa-Fe\\" batch of songs had been obtained by bootleggers, and almost all known Dylan Basement Tape songs were assembled onto the 5-CD bootleg The Genuine Basement Tapes. \\"Sante-Fe\\" was also included on the 2014 compilations The Basement Tapes Raw and The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete; the latter album officially released a fourth batch of previously uncirculating Basement Tape songs. Personnel The liner notes for The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3 list the song's personnel as Dylan, guitar and vocals; Robertson, guitar; Hudson, organ; Manuel, piano; Danko, bass; and Helm, drums. However, Griffin argues that Helm did not arrive in Woodstock until after the song is believed to have been recorded. Furthermore, the drumming sounds to Griffin more like Manuel's style. Heylin and biographer Greil Marcus similarly do not include \\"Santa-Fe\\" among the songs they believe were recorded after Helm's arrival. Griffin also argues that no organ is audible on the track and proposes the following musician line-up as being more likely: Dylan, acoustic guitar and vocals; Robertson, electric guitar; Hudson, piano; Danko, bass; Manuel, drums. Copyright and lyrics Different Basement Tapes songs were copyrighted in stages between 1967 and 1975, with \\"Santa-Fe\\" being registered in September 1973; still other songs from the sessions were not copyrighted until the 1980s. Researcher Tim Dunn indicates that in the original 1973 copyright the song was registered as \\"Santa-Fe\\" with a hyphen, but that some later documents relating to the renewal of the copyright omit the hyphen. The liner notes of The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3 print the title as \\"Santa-Fe\\", while Dylan's official website, Bobdylan.com, spells it without the hyphen but with an accent on the e: \\"Santa F√©\\". Heylin has noted that, as is the case with a number of other of Basement Tapes tracks, Dylan's copyrighted, published \\"Santa-Fe\\" lyrics differ from what can be heard on the song. Heylin speculates that the \\"dramatic reworking\\" in the later version arose from Dylan's \\"1973 musing in Malibu\\", where Dylan had moved to, and that new lines like \\"build a geodesic dome and sail away\\" and \\"My shrimp boat's in the bay\\" sound like the work of \\"someone sitting on the dock of the bay, not up on Meads Mountain [in Woodstock]\\". Heylin also notes that the website maintained by Olof Bj√∂rner, Words Fill My Head, contains a transcription of the song as Dylan performed it. The 1973 copyrighted lyrics are printed on Bobdylan.com. In his notes for The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3, Bauldie describes the song as \\"a typical combination of nonsense and fun, just for the hell of it, really ...\\"; author Oliver Trager likewise describes it as a \\"nonsense\\" song. Heylin writes that the lyrics \\"revolve around 'dear, dear, dear, dear, Santa Fe'‚Äîintended to be both a woman's name and the town in New Mexico. After five verses of rolling said words around, he moves on.\\" Appraisal Opinions about the song have been mixed. AllMusic critic Thomas Ward calls it \\"one of the great good-time songs in Dylan's canon\\". Ward comments that \\"Dylan sings it as if he is having the time of his life\\", adding that \\"rarely has he sung with such expressiveness\\". Anthony Varesi, author of The Bob Dylan Albums, similarly praises the song's \\"breadth of feeling\\" and \\"unparalleled expressiveness\\", noting that \\"it appears Dylan simply improvised the song on the spot, and the passion within him allows the song to flow forth naturally\\". Biographer John Nagowski has described the song as \\"delightful\\", while a New York Times review rates it one of the highlights of Volume 2 of The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3, commenting that it is one of only a couple of mid-60s songs on the compilation that \\"live up to their vintage\\". Griffin describes it as \\"catchy but slight\\" and \\"a slight if charming little ditty\\", but criticizes the decision to include it on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3 rather than the \\"masterpiece\\" composition \\"Sign on the Cross\\". Heylin concurs, characterizing \\"Santa-Fe\\" in 1995 as a \\"pleasant enough throwaway\\" but suggesting that \\"Sign on the Cross\\" or another 1967 composition, \\"I'm Not There\\", would have been much better choices (\\"I'm Not There\\" was eventually released in 2007 on the I'm Not There soundtrack, and both it and \\"Sign on the Cross\\" were included on The Basement Tapes Raw and The Basement Tapes Complete in 2014). By 2009, Heylin's opinion had changed little and he writes that \\"of all the 'missing' basement-tape originals that appear on that three-CD set, 'Santa Fe' hardly represented an A-list candidate. Just another discarded ditty, it relies on the usual wordplay and slurred diction to obscure any pretense to a deeper meaning\\". Marcus dismisses it as no more than \\"a riff\\", while a review in Stereophile magazine calls it \\"the most lightweight tune on all three CDs, with indecipherable lyrics\\". Author Peter James, referring to Dylan and the Band's Woodstock output, writes that \\"many great songs were written and recorded in [Big Pink's] basement in 1967, unfortunately 'Sante- Fe' is not one of them.\\" He goes on to describe the song's inclusion on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3 as \\"little more than a joke\\". Cover versions The song has been covered by Howard Fishman on his album Performs Bob Dylan & The Band's The Basement Tapes Live at Joe's Pub. Fishman played more than sixty songs from Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes sessions over three nights, of which selected tracks were included on the CD and an accompanying DVD. \\"Santa-Fe\\" has also been covered by Steve Gibbons. On November 7, 2007 at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, J Mascis and the Million Dollar Bashers performed the song at a special concert featuring numerous music artists celebrating the release of Todd Haynes's film I'm Not There. Thomas Ward notes that Dylan himself has never played the song live.

The northern end of The Centre, known as Magpie Park, is skirted on its western edge by Colston Avenue; the southern end is a larger paved area bounded by St Augustine's Parade to the west, Broad Quay the east, and St Augustine's Reach (part of the Floating Harbour) to the south, and bisected by the 2016 extension of Baldwin Street. The Centre is managed by Bristol City Council. The name 'The Centre' (or 'The City Centre') appears to have been applied to the area from the mid-twentieth century; before that, from 1893 when the upper part of St Augustine's reach was covered, it was known as the Tramways Centre and Magpie Park. The Centre is not the historic or civic centre of Bristol, nor is it a major shopping area. It is, however, an important local transport interchange and cultural destination. Many local bus services terminate at or pass through here, and it is also served by ferry services to Hotwells and Bristol Temple Meads station, and has busy taxi ranks. The Centre has been altered on a number of occasions, originally to ease traffic flow but latterly to try to strike a balance between its use as both public open space and an important traffic corridor. In 2017, alterations to accommodate the MetroBus bus rapid transit scheme were completed.  History  = Before the culvert = The Centre owes its form to the channel dug in the 1240s to provide additional quays and wharves for the burgeoning Bristol Docks. This channel, St Augustine's Reach, became the heart of Bristol Docks. As trade flourished and ships became larger the docks expanded, but the completion of the Floating Harbour in 1809, and the building of docks at Avonmouth and Portishead, made the wharves at the northern end of St Augustine's Reach increasingly marginal. The northern end of St Augustine's Reach was narrower and accessed by opening The Drawbridge, which crossed the docks at the end of Clare Street (where present-day Baldwin Street was built in 1881). The Drawbridge was rebuilt for the fourth and final time in 1868, but by 1893 when it was replaced by a fixed structure it had been a source of \\"great congestion\\" to traffic (including the new trams) for many years, often being left open for twenty minutes while ships were roped up. = Magpie Park = In 1892 The Drawbridge was replaced by the elegant stone St Augustine's Bridge; at the same time the docks to the north were infilled. The new area, which was called Magpie Park, was enclosed by Colston Avenue. It was named after the newspaper The Bristol Magpie, whose offices were located on the western side of Colston Avenue. The Bristol Industrial and Fine Arts Exhibition was held here in 1893; this popular attraction saw 500,000 attendees and raised ¬£2200 for charity. This is now the site of the Bristol Cenotaph, unveiled in 1932. The Cenotaph continues to be the focus of local remembrance. = Tramways Centre = During the 1890s, Bristol's tramway system was expanded and electrified. In 1896 the Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company (BT&CC;) moved their head office to premises at 1‚Äì3 St Augustine's Parade, where they remained until 1970. The need for a central interchange was recognised and to this end a large triangular traffic island, later nicknamed 'Skivvy's Island' because of its use by domestic servants, was built between the BT&CC; offices and St Augustine's Bridge. The Tramways Centre became the most important of the BT&CC;'s three central termini, serving more routes than the others at Bristol Bridge and Old Market. It was the terminus for trams from the north and east of the city, and trams from Hotwells to Temple Meads station and Brislington also stopped here. Passengers could straightforwardly alight from one tram and board another to continue their journey without the need to cross roads. A large three-faced ornamental clock was fixed high on the Tramways offices, and 'under the clock on The Centre' became a popular meeting place. J. B. Priestley visited Bristol in 1933, and described The Centre as 'a place where trams and coastal steamers seemed in danger of collision'. Buses first started to use the Tramways Centre in 1910, initially only on the route to Clifton. By 1913, ten bus routes started from The Centre. In 1938 and 1939 the tram routes serving the Tramways Centre were replaced by buses, so that trams ceased to use the island. Trams elsewhere in the city ceased completely in 1941. = Inner Circuit Road = In 1938 construction started on a culvert covering the area between St Augustine's Bridge and the southern end of Broad Quay. This created a route for the Inner Circuit Road, which had already bisected Queen Square, to continue northwards. Construction continued despite the outbreak of war. A large elongated roundabout was formed, with the central space initially being used as a car park. The Tramways Centre island remained, devoid of trams. After the war the central space was planted with lawns, ornamental borders and golden Irish yews and became known as the Centre Gardens. = 1957 remodelling = The Inner Circuit Road was extended northwards into Colston Avenue in 1957‚Äì58. The Tramways Centre island was removed and the Centre Gardens island was extended to a point near the end of St Stephen's Street. Magpie Park was reduced in length, Colston Avenue was widened and many of the (by then) mature plane trees were felled. = 1998 remodelling = It had been recognised since the 1960s that the southern half of the Inner Circuit Road had badly impacted the amenity of Queen Square and The Centre, and by the 1990s tentative steps were being taken towards downgrading this part of the road and transferring traffic along less sensitive routes. By the mid-1990s, the road across Queen Square had been closed and plans were being developed to re-balance The Centre in favour of pedestrians and public transport. The water fountains and paddling area in 2006, part of the 'Promenade Option'. The sail structure, removed in 2009, is shown behind Bristol City Council launched a consultation exercise in 1996, in which the public were asked to choose between a 'Dock Option' (reopening the old harbour as far as St Augustine's Bridge) and a cheaper 'Promenade Option'. Both options involved closing the road across Quay Head; the Promenade Option used the new space to create a larger pedestrianised area in place of the Centre Gardens, with fountains, a cascade leading down to the waterside, and a sail structure to evoke Bristol's maritime past. The remaining road space in both options would be designed to give greater priority to public transport. The Council decided to build the 'Promenade Option'. This soon came under criticism for its poor safety, particularly after a number of pedestrians were injured by vehicles and at least two people struck by buses and killed. The new design was also criticised for its traffic noise and fumes, \\"dribbling\\" fountains, poor traffic flow, poor cycling infrastructure, and delays to public transport. Few were happy with the new design, and many were disappointed that the 'Dock Option' had not been pursued. The area around the pedestrian crossing at the Baldwin Street end of Broad Quay was altered in 2003 after the Bristol Coroner called for improvements following an inquest on the death of a pedestrian hit by a bus. Despite remedial work in 2007, the sail structure was found to be unsafe and removed in 2009. In 2011 plans were again being developed for major changes to The Centre. These plans include the possibility of prohibiting private vehicles from crossing The Centre on the east-west axis, as mooted in the 1996 consultation. = 2015 remodelling for MetroBus = Between 2015 and 2018 the layout of The Centre was changed once more, this time to accommodate the MetroBus bus rapid transit scheme. Private motor traffic was routed along the western edge of The Centre, and the gyratory traffic system was replaced by extended and more accessible pedestrian spaces. The new layout reduced the number of routes available to general traffic, some of which was diverted away from the area, whilst improving segregation for cycles and buses. The taxi ranks were relocated, and new bus stops were constructed for MetroBus services. Early indications suggest that journey times have been improved by these changes.  Sites of interest  As well as the Cenotaph, Magpie Park has a bronze statue by James Havard Thomas of MP Edmund Burke (1894) and had a statue of slave trader Edward Colston (1895, by John Cassidy). On 7 June 2020, the statue of Colston was pulled down during a Black Lives Matter demonstration, following the killing of George Floyd in the United States. A drinking fountain commemorates the 1893 Industrial and Fine Art Exhibition. St Mary on the Quay stands on Colston Avenue to the west of the park, and St Stephen's Church stands nearby to the east. The southern end of The Centre (the Centre Promenade) has a 1723 lead statue of Neptune, moved to The Centre from Temple Street in 1949 and now Grade II* listed. There is a modern water feature with fountains, and another stepped water feature leads down to a ferry landing stage at the current head of St Augustine's Reach. There is a busy taxi rank on Colston Avenue, near its junction with Baldwin Street. The Hippodrome stands to the west of the Centre Promenade on St Augustine's Parade. Further north is the Colston Tower and just west of this on Colston Street is the soon-to-be-renamed Colston Hall. On Broad Quay, the former head office tower of the Bristol and West Building Society was repurposed in 2011 into a hotel and serviced flats. The Centre is part of the College Green Conservation Area.

It was released exclusively in Japan. The game is notable for featuring nearly every monster in the Godzilla franchise up until the time of its release. Story While the game does not feature a distinguishable story, the basic premise is that hundreds of monsters have arisen all over Japan and Godzilla is the only one who can defeat all of them. Human armies will attempt to slow down Godzilla and the other monsters' rampage. The game ends with a final battle between Godzilla and Super MechaGodzilla, with Godzilla emerging as the victor and retaining his title as the King of the Monsters. Gameplay Godzilla facing the first boss monster in the game, Ebirah. The game is a 2D side-scroller, with Godzilla being the only playable character. Godzilla can use a wide variety of attacks, including a punch, a kick, and a tail whip. He can also use his signature atomic breath, which can be fired up, down, or straight. Using the aforementioned attack drains him of his health. If Godzilla stops moving, his health gradually gets restored. Buildings on the background can sometimes be interacted with, and if destroyed, will sometimes refill Godzilla's health quickly. The game does not feature a save system, and it only allows the player to continue for three times if they are killed. There are five levels, with each level containing a final boss monster that Godzilla needs to defeat before he is able to progress further into the game. Aside from monsters, various human vehicles such as warships, gunships, fighter jets, and tanks also serve as enemies in the game. However, they do not deal significant damage to Godzilla and can be destroyed easily. Bosses Below is a list of the boss monsters in the game, in the order by which they appear.

He also represented his state in Australian rules football.  Biography  Smith, who played his football as a ruckman, had an imposing figure, standing two metres tall and weighing 100 kg.The Argus, \\"'Giant' to train with Bulldogs\\", 8 April 1952. p. 9 On the cricket field he was a fast-medium paceman, who opening the bowling, usually with Len Johnson. He played regularly in the Queensland Australian National Football League for Yeronga and in 1950 was picked in the state squad to go to the Brisbane Carnival, only to withdraw with an injury. The Queenslander made his first-class cricket debut in the 1946/47 season, against the touring Indian team, but failed to pick up a wicket. He went for 75 runs in the first innings and then 42 from just five overs in the second. Another opportunity came two years later and from then until 1953/54 he missed few matches for Queensland. In the 1951/52 Sheffield Shield season, Smith took 20 wickets at 28.65, the best return of his career. He had also taken his innings figures, 7-58, in a match against Victoria at the SCG. It was the first time in Sheffield Shield history that a Queensland bowler had taken Victorian wickets in one innings. The Victorians continued to see the best of Smith throughout his career, with his final tally showing 32 wickets at 23.34. He played another international side that season, with the West Indies in the country for a Test series. Although he only took two wickets, both of them were an opening batsman, Jeff Stollmeyer. Another Test batsman who Smith had success with over the course of his career was Sam Loxton, whom he dismissed five times in first-class cricket. He was invited by Footscray president, Con Weichart, to train with the Victorian Football League club in April 1952. Weichart had spotted Smith at the MCG, when he was playing a Shield match against Victoria, and was impressed by his agility. He trained with coach Charlie Sutton for two weeks but in the end decided to stay in Queensland.The Courier-Mail, \\"Smith Not Keen To Go Away\\", 29 April 1952. p. 7 Footscray instead debuted ruckman Brian Gilmore in 1952, who would play in the club's first ever premiership in 1954. After returns of 19 wickets at 31.57 and 16 wickets in 35.37, over the next two Shield season, Smith wasn't picked again for Queensland. The selectors had needed to drop a bowler, in order to fit former New South Wales bowling all-rounder Ray Lindwall in the team, and Smith was the one to make way.

Subgroup members (formulae from IMA): *Whiteite-(CaFeMg), IMA1975-001, CaFe2+Mg2Al2(PO4)4(OH)2¬∑8H2O *Whiteite-(MnFeMg), IMA1978-A, Mn2+Fe2+Mg2Al2(PO4)4(OH)2¬∑8H2O *Whiteite-(CaMnMg), IMA1986-012, CaMn2+Mg2Al2(PO4)4(OH)2¬∑8H2O *Rittmannite, Mn2+Mn2+Fe2+2Al2(PO4)4(OH)2¬∑8H2O In the whiteite formulae, the symbols in brackets indicate the dominant atom in three distinct structural positions, designated X, M(1), and M(2), in that order; for instance, magnesium Mg is always the dominant atom in the M(2) position for all the whiteite minerals. Whiteite was named after John Sampson White Jr (born 1933), associate curator of minerals at the Smithsonian Institution, and founder, editor and publisher (1970-1982) of the Mineralogical Record. Unit cell All members of the series belong to the monoclinic crystal system with point group 2/m. Most sources give the space group as P21/a for the Ca Fe rich member, which was the first of the series to be described, but Dana gives it as P2/a. The other members are variously described in different sources as having space groups P21/a, P2/a or Pa. There are two formula units per unit cell (Z = 2). The cell parameters vary slightly between the group members, but to the nearest angstrom they all have a = 15 √Ö, b = 7 √Ö and c = 10 √Ö, with Œ≤ 112.5 to 113.4. Individual values are: *Whiteite-(CaFeMg) a = 14.90 √Ö, b = 6.98 √Ö, c = 10.13 √Ö, Œ≤ = 113.12 *Whiteite-(MnFeMg) a = 14.99 √Ö, b = 6.96 √Ö, c = 10.14 √Ö, Œ≤ = 113.32 *Whiteite-(CaMnMg) a = 14.842 √Ö, b = 6.976 √Ö, c = 10.109 √Ö, Œ≤ = 112.59 Appearance The whiteite minerals are generally brown, pink or yellow, and whiteite-(CaMnMg) may also be light lavender coloured. They are transparent to translucent, with a vitreous luster and a white to brownish white streak. They occur as aggregates of tabular crystals, or thick tabular canoe-shaped crystals. Whiteite from Rapid Creek in the Yukon, Canada, is often associated with deep blue lazulite crystals (33 out of 49 photos on Mindat.org). Optical properties The optical class is thought to be biaxial (+), but whiteite-(CaFeMg) may be biaxial (-). The refractive indices are Nx = 1.580, Ny = 1.584 to 1.585 and Nz = 1.590 to 1.591, similar to those for quartz. Physical properties Whiteite is invariably twinned, giving the crystals a pseudo-orthorhombic appearance, and the cleavage is good to perfect. Whiteite is quite soft, with hardness 3 to 4, between calcite and fluorite. Its specific gravity is 2.58, similar to that of quartz. Whiteite is not radioactive. Occurrence The type locality for whiteite-(CaFeMg)and whiteite-(MnFeMg) is the Ilha claim, Taquaral, Itinga, Jequitinhonha valley, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and for whiteite-(CaMnMg) it is the Tip Top Mine (Tip Top pegmatite), Fourmile, Custer District, Custer County, South Dakota, US. The type material is conserved at the National School of Mines, Paris, France, and at the National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC, US, reference 123013. At the Lavra da Ilha pegmatite, Taquaral, Brazil, whiteite is found in a complex zoned granite pegmatite associated with eosphorite, zanazziite, wardite, albite and quartz. At Blow River, the Yukon, Canada, it is found in iron-rich sedimentary rocks with siderite, lazulite, arrojadite and quartz. At Ilha de Taquaral, Minas Gerais, Brazil, it occurs along joints and fractures in quartz and albite associated with other phosphates.

It runs from Leipzig through the valley of the White Elster via Zeitz, Gera, Triptis, the Orlasenke lowland and Saalfeld to Probstzella. Since it runs parallel with the Saal Railway but is higher, it is also called the Obere Bahn (\\"upper railway\\"). Route  Gera Hauptbahnhof Southern section of the route The line begins in Leipzig Leutzsch and runs south from the city. The line then runs through the flat Leipzig Bay along the Elster through the former central German lignite mining area. This section of the line was once used to transport lignite to nearby power plants, but this traffic has declined considerably. The line reaches Zeitz at the southern edge of the lowlands, where it connects with other lines, although some of the network has been closed since 1990. The hills on either side of the White Elster south of Zeitz are steeper. Near Ahlendorf (the administrative centre of Heideland-Elstertal), the line crosses the border between Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. The line now runs on a long curve through the communities of Crossen an der Elster and the brewery town of Bad K√∂stritz to Gera, where it meets several other lines. Until 1998, the Crossen‚ÄìPorstendorf line ran from Crossen an der Elster station via Eisenberg and B√ºrgel to Porstendorf (north of Jena). The line runs to the south from Gera Hauptbahnhof. Once out of the city it runs along the banks of the White Elster before running along the valley of the Weida. To the west of the town of Weida the line crosses a crest on the approach to Triptis at an altitude of about 375 metres above sea level. The line now runs through the Orlasenke lowland and continues on a straight path to the south-west through the town of Neustadt an der Orla, continuing to Oppurg, where until 1944 the Orla Railway branched off towards P√∂√üneck unterer (lower) station and Orlam√ºnde. It then runs through P√∂√üneck ober (upper) station to Saalfeld, where it connects with the Saal Railway, which links Berlin and Munich. History  The second quarter of the line was opened in 1859. At that time, a line was built from Wei√üenfels (connecting there with the Thuringian Railway opened in 1846) via Zeitz to Gera. It was the first line to Gera, which was capital of the Principality of Reuss Younger Line and had about 14,000 inhabitants at that time. The northern section of the line between Zeitz and Leipzig traffic was opened in 1873. Until the completion of the connecting curve between the Thuringian railway and the Saal Railway at Gro√üheringen in 1900, it was the most important link between Prussia and Bavaria, except for the Saxon-Bavarian Railway. Although the curve at Gro√üheringen meant that the Saal Railway was 25 km shorter, the north‚Äìsouth connection (Nord-S√ºd-Verbindung) through Gera continued to be used as a long- distance line from Leipzig in the north to Nuremberg in the south. The section from Gera to Eichicht (now part of Kaulsdorf) was opened on 20 December 1871. It was of great importance for the nearby towns. It allowed the textile industry in the Orlasenke, especially in P√∂√üneck, to grow rapidly before the First World War. P√∂√üneck thus became a centre of the Thuringian textile industry along with Apolda and Greiz. Also of importance to this section was the former Maxh√ºtte steel and rolling mill in Unterwellenborn as well as the steel works, now known as the Thuringian Steelworks (Stahlwerk Th√ºringen). The line built in 1871 ran through the following states (starting in Gera): Reuss Younger Line, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Prussia, Saxe-Meiningen, Prussia, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Sachsen-Meiningen. A temporary terminus was built in Eichicht as the route for the continuation of the line and connection to Bavaria was still unclear. Before the Second World War the entire line was double track. In 1946 the second track was dismantled as reparations to the Soviet Union. The line at Knautnaundorf was realigned for the establishment of an open cut lignite mine under the East German regime. The section from Saalfeld and Probstzella was electrified by 1939. Seven years later, all components of the electrification along with the second track were removed for reparations to the Soviet Union. Because of the division of Germany the line had little importance for the next four decades. Double track has been restored on the sections between Leipzig Hauptbahnhof and Zeitz, between Gera Hauptbahnhof and Gera S√ºd and between Unterwellenborn and Probstzella. Electrification has been restored on the section between Saalfeld and Probstzella. Operations until 2012 Regional-Express (RE) 12 services and Regionalbahn (RB) 51 services run between Leipzig and Gera. The RB and RE services both run every two hours, alternating with each other to create an hourly service. In addition, on Saturdays (during the summer timetable), a pair of RE trains run from Leipzig via Gera and Saalfeld to Blankenstein (Schiefergebirgs-Express) and to Katzh√ºtte (Schwarzatal Express). The Gera- Saalfeld section was served by RE 4 services between Gera and Saalfeld every two hours. In addition, RB services alternate with the RE services every two hours between the two cities. These are mostly operated by class 612 and class 642 diesel multiple units. Until 2012 all services had been operated by DB Regio. Current operations  Since 2012, passenger services on the Leipzig‚ÄìZeitz‚ÄìGera‚ÄìSaalfeld section are operated by Erfurter Bahn. Since 15 December 2013 S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland trains use this line between Leipzig- Leutzsch and Leipzig-Plagwitz.

Biography Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, graduating high school at Sioux County High School, Skavdahl received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1989 from the University of Wyoming. He received his Juris Doctor in 1992 from the University of Wyoming College of Law. At the University of Wyoming, Skavdahl was an active member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity. Skavdahl worked as a litigation associate at Brown & Drew (now Brown, Drew & Massey) from 1992 to 1994. From 1994 to 1997, Skavdahl served as a judicial law clerk to Chief Judge William F. Downes of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. From 1997 to 2003 Skavdahl worked at the law firm of Williams, Porter, Day & Neville. From 2001 to 2003 he worked as a part-time federal magistrate judge. In 2003 Skavdahl became a judge on the Seventh Judicial District Court, in Casper, Wyoming upon appointment by Governor Dave Freudenthal. On January 31, 2011 Skavdahl left the state bench to once more become a full-time federal magistrate judge. Federal judicial service In November 2010, Governor Dave Freudenthal recommended Skavdahl to fill the Wyoming vacancy that was to be created when Judge William F. Downes retired on July 24, 2011. On February 16, 2011, President Barack Obama formally nominated Skavdahl. On September 8, 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported his nomination to the Senate floor by voice vote. On November 3, 2011, the Senate voted 96‚Äì0 to confirm Skavdahl. He received his commission on November 7, 2011. He became Chief Judge on June 1, 2018 succeeding Nancy D. Freudenthal. Notable case In a June 21, 2016, decision, Skavdahl held that Congress did not authorize the Bureau of Land Management to regulate hydraulic fracturing. The BLM's \\"Oil and Gas; Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands; Final Rule\\" (43 CFR Part 3160) sought to set standards for wellbore construction, chemical disclosure, and water management for hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands. He rejected the BLM's reliance on longstanding land management statutes as authorizing the rule. Instead, he looked to the statute that regulated hydraulic fracturing in its 2005 Energy Policy Act. There, Congress deprived the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) except when diesel fuels are used. The court reasoned that Congress had not indirectly conferred far broader authority on the BLM via general land management statutes than it had given directly on the EPA.Federal Judge Strikes Down Obama Administration's Fracking Rules, National Public Radio, Camila Domonoske, June 22, 2016.

Genetic Alliance UK's aim is to improve the lives of people affected by genetic conditions, ensuring that high quality services and information are available to all who need them. Activities The group's work is primarily policy campaigns. It has campaigned for improved regulation and governance of clinical research, including animal research, improved access to new technology such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and has responded to Government consultations on the restructuring of the National Health Service between 2010 and 2012 to ensure that the needs of those with genetic conditions are properly addressed. The group also commissions projects covering issues of common interest to its members; these have included insurance, prenatal diagnosis, patient access and patient information. It also works on gathering evidence of need through research projects and on directly improving information and services to patients. The work has expanded outside the United Kingdom into the European Union. The group works through EGAN (European Genetic Alliance Network) to promote the interests of those with genetic conditions at European Commission and European Parliament.  History  1989: The group was founded in 1989 as Genetic Interest Group, after a group of approximately twelve charities proposed an alliance, with the backing of the British Clinical Genetics Society.UK charity becomes Genetic Alliance UK phg foundation 7 June 2010 1993: Genetic Interest Group became a founding member of the European Alliance of Genetic Support Groups (EAGS) ‚Äì now known as the Patients‚Äô Network for Health and Medical Research (EGAN). 1995: The Disability Discrimination Act passed. Genetic Interest Group lobbied to amend the Bill to ensure people pre-symptomatic for a genetic disorder would be protected against discrimination. 2003: Genetic Interest Group lobbied the Department of Health for more investment in rare disease research. There was a successful outcome in the White Paper on genetics on 24 June 2003, with ¬£3 million earmarked to fund research into rare diseases. 2008: The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 passed. Genetic Alliance UK's lobbying work influenced the law on a number of issues including preimplantation genetic testing, saviour siblings and human-animal hybrid embryos. Rare Disease UK was launched to campaign for a strategic approach to rare diseases in the UK. 2010: Genetic Interest Group became Genetic Alliance UK \\\\- the decision was made to change the name and branding of the organisation to better reflect its work. 2011: SWAN UK (syndromes without a name) was relaunched as a project of Genetic Alliance UK, to continue supporting families of children with a syndrome without a name ‚Äì taking over from Liz Swingwood, the grandmother of a child with an undiagnosed genetic condition. 2013: The UK Strategy for Rare Diseases was launched in November following years of hard work by our Rare Disease UK campaign. 2014: Genetic Alliance UK published its first patient charter, on the NICE Highly Specialised Technology Programme. Five patient charters on access to medicines and on genome sequencing have now been published. The group now represents over 200 voluntary organisations and has representation on numerous bodies in the UK, Europe and the rest of the world.  Rare Disease UK  Rare Disease UK (RDUK) is a joint initiative of Genetic Alliance UK with other interested bodies. It focuses on the unmet healthcare needs of families with inadequate access to integrated care and support from the National Health Service. It aims to ensure the efficient use of scarce expertise, and promote the targeted use of health care resources to maximise benefits for all patients and families affected by rare diseases in the UK. Its programme advocates a coherent UK national strategy consisting of: *Research into rare diseases *Prevention and diagnosis of rare diseases *Treatment of rare diseases *Information on rare diseases for patients and the public *Planning and actual commissioning of rare diseases facilities *Care and support for rare disease patients In the past decade, there have been innovative strategies for the establishment of multidisciplinary centres of excellence for patient and family care. The group plans to build on this existing infrastructure and expertise to expand the nationwide availability of such resources. The Rare Disease UK initiative is based on the European Council's Recommendation for action in the field of rare diseases. The recommendation stressed strengthening research programmes in the field, encouraging the development of national rare disease policies, and developing and sharing common European guidelines, such as access to high quality information.  SWAN UK (syndromes without a name)  SWAN UK (syndrome without a name) is the only dedicated support network available for families of children and young adults (0‚Äì25 years) with undiagnosed genetic conditions in the UK. SWAN UK is free to join and has been run by the charity Genetic Alliance UK since 2011. In 2015, SWAN UK created an animation called ‚ÄòEllie's story' explaining what it means to have an undiagnosed genetic condition and how SWAN UK helps, supported by House of Fraser.

A 2/4 seater with a single pusher engine, it was built in France and the United States in small numbers with several variations. Design and development Designed in 1975 and first flown in 1981, the Orion was one of the earliest kitbuilt aircraft to be constructed from composite materials. It is a low wing cantilever monoplane with a T-tail, of conventional layout except for its pusher configuration; this places the cabin well ahead of the leading edge and provides an excellent downward view. The Orion is built from Kevlar reinforced glassfibre shells, with foam filling in the wings. The latter, which have 4.5¬∞ of dihedral, are straight edged and only slightly tapered, with blunt tips. They carry electrically driven split flaps. Its cabin seats four in two side-by-side rows and is entered by centrally hinged gull wing doors. The engine, a Lycoming O-360 variant of either 180 hp or 200 hp (134/149 kW) is mounted over the wing trailing edge line and drives a three-bladed propeller, mounted at the extreme tail, via a long shaft. Behind the wing the fuselage tapers on its underside; it carries a broad fin with a straight, swept leading edge and rudder, on top of which is the straight, tapered tailplane and horn balanced elevators. Below the fuselage is a long, shallow ventral strake. The tricycle undercarriage is electrically retractable. The main legs fold inwards; when deployed, they splay out strongly. Operational history The first prototype of the plan- built G-801 Orion flew for the first time on 2 June 1981, configured as a two- seater and powered by a 65 hp (48.5 kW) engine. The first kit-production aircraft, designated G-802 Orion, differed from the G-801 chiefly by having a wider cabin and a slightly longer fuselage (increased by 140 mm or 5.5 in). This first flew in November 1983, powered by a 180 hp Lycoming. By early 1985 140 plans for G-801s and 80 G-802 kits had been sold, but the development programme was halted by the death of its designer on 3 April 1985 whilst demonstrating the aircraft. Grinvald G-802 Orion Plans and kits were distributed by A√©rodis in France and by Aerodis America Inc. in the USA. Individual builders, often using the original moulds at Brienne-le-Chateau, continued to innovate. Around 1990 Jaques Darcissac built an Orion with a fuselage strengthened with wire mesh and with a more robust undercarriage, which he named the Darcissac-Grinvalds DG-87 Go√©land (Seagull in English) and this name has been used by three other builders. Other builders have also given their aircraft different names, such as Gerfaut, Gypa√®te and Scorpion. A new version of the Orion, tailored for US market was designed, known as the AA200. By the end of 2008 about 17 Orion variants had been flown, with another nine under construction. Most have been registered in France, though three are on the US register.

It consist of seven volumes published in Paris, Parma, Firenze (Ex Tipographia A. Stocchii between 1856 and 1877. It is written in Latin. The subject is the Diptera of Italy. A prodromus is a preliminary publication intended as a basis for future work - Rondani's Expression is \\"un programma, o, per meglio dire, una proposta che vuol essere esaminata e discussa e quindi riformata, dietro le considerazioni dei dotti in tale materia\\", in English a programme, or, better to say, a proposal to be examined and discussed and therefore changed, after the considerations of scholars in such materia\\". Nineteen publications and twenty memoires, fragments and commentaries by R√≥ndani complement the prodromo. These are not part of the work but integrate sections, add further information, modify, complement and illuminate the prodromo text. Volume 1 Volume I is an overview presented as a dichotomous key of classification of the thirty-two families and eighty-four stirpi (subfamilies) of European Diptera.It is titled Genera italica ordinis depterorum ordinatim disposita et distincta et in familias et stirpes aggregata and also keys to genera very many of them new Carl Robert Osten-Sacken said of Volume 1 Osten-Sacken, C. R., 1903 Record of my life and work in entomology. Cambridge (Mass.) quoting Hermann Loew Loew, H. 1858, Dipterologiae Italicae prodromus Berlin Ent Zeit 1858:338-340 \\"The first volume of the \\" Prodromus\\" contains dichotomic tables of the families and genera of Italian Diptera, published in advance of the intended work upon them. The number of genera (according to Loew's statement, loc. cit., p. 338) is 587 ; among them a considerable number are new ones, the names of which are introduced without any other description but that contained in the data of the dichotomic tables, connected with the name of the typical, often as yet undescribed, species. Loew was right in calling this premature publication a failure calculated to impede, rather than to advance, the future progress of dipterology. Loew enumerates a large number of errors, misspelling of names and misprints\\". This, however, is the technical view and whilst it is true that the Prodromus causes some nomenclatural problems the review overlooks the fact (recognised by both Osten-Sacken and Loew) that the work is a prodromus, a regional fauna and an identification manual as well as a systematic treatise in a universal language (Latin).The problem of nomina nuda was resolved as the succeeding volumes were published and the errors, misspelling of names and misprints identified by Loew were largely corrected in later errata and the Prodromus as a whole is one of the most cited works on European Diptera.

The site was first excavated in the 1890s and again as recently as the 2005 to 2011 archaeological field school led by Dr. Kevin E. Smith. A number of important finds have been associated with the site, most particularly several examples of Mississippian stone statuary and the Castalian Springs shell gorget held by the National Museum of the American Indian. The site is owned by the State of Tennessee and is a State Historic Site managed by the Bledsoe's Lick Association for the Tennessee Historical Commission. The site is not currently open to the public. Site The Castalian Springs site is the largest of four Mississippian mound centers on the eastern edge of the Nashville basin, located on a flood terrace of a tributary creek of the Cumberland River. It was occupied from 1100 to 1450 CE, with the main occupation dating to 1200-1325 CE. The palisaded village and surrounding habitation area was approximately in size and consisted of a dozen platform mounds, a burial mound, plaza and a number of dwellings and civic structures. The site was first noted in the early 1820s by Ralph E.W. Earl, who did extensive digging at the site. He described a low earthen embankment with raised earthen towers enclosing , the remnants of what is now known to have been a wooden palisade. Earl also described the principal mound ( Mound 2) inside the enclosure as being a compound structure consisting of a rectangular platform long by wide and to in height and aligned in an east-west direction. On the western end of the platform was a conical shaped mound with a flattened top, approximately to in height. On the southern side of the mound was a plaza, which was bordered on its eastern edge by a in diameter tall burial mound (Mound 1) and on its western edge by another large platform mound (Mound 3). Outside of the palisade to southwest on the banks of Lick Creek was a stone mound (Mound 4) in diameter and , similar examples of which have been found at the Beasley Mounds and Sellars Indian Mound sites. Over the years since Earls first description Euro-Americans have plowed the area for agricultural purposes and consequently the main platform mound and a few raised impressions are all that are still visible of the embankment and the 12 platform mounds once contained within it. Scattered throughout the area archaeologists have also found stone box graves, mortuary caves and other features thought to be associated with the Castalian Springs site. The karst terrain of the area produced numerous small caves, one of which is located a few hundred yards west of the Castalian Springs site. Known locally as the \\"Cave of the Skulls\\" (40SU126), this small cave was explored by Myer at sometime during one of his three excavation of the site. Excavations In the early 1890s and again in 1916-1917, amateur archaeologist William E. Myer (later a ‚Äúspecial archeologist‚Äù with the Smithsonian,) excavated parts of the site, including the stone box graves. He also excavated the large burial mound, which contained well over a hundred graves. Myer discovered several artifacts containing S.E.C.C. imagery, including many shell gorgets which were later acquired by the Museum of the American Indian in 1926. The State of Tennessee purchased the site in 2005, and modern excavations were instituted by the Middle Tennessee State University. Dr. Kevin E. Smith conducted an archaeological dig school at the village site from 2005 through 2011. The Castalian Springs Archaeological Project is a multi-year research project sponsored by the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Middle Tennessee State University, the Bledsoe's Lick Historical Association and the Tennessee Division of Archaeology. Its stated objectives are to develop an initial understanding of the size and extent of the site, to develop trails and other facilities on the site without negatively impacting archaeological deposits, to give university students training in the methods and techniques of professional field and laboratory archaeology, and to emphasize to the public the value of archaeological research. =Important finds= A number of Mississippian stone statues have been dug up at the site, the first being sometime before 1823 when it is first mentioned. Since then several others have been found, including one believed to have been dug from the platform section of the main mound and several from one of the associated village areas. In 1892 an etched stone tablet was discovered at the site by Myer. The by limestone tablet is engraved with symbolic imagery associated with the S.E.C.C., specifically the upper torso of a human figure ceremonially dressed as a raptorial bird with a sun symbol on its chest. The iconography is very similar to depictions of the falcon dancer found on Mississippian copper plates excavated from locations across the Midwest and Southeast. The tablet was the second of only six such tablets that have been found in the Central Tennessee area. Another more famous engraved stone, the Thruston tablet, was found a short distance away from Castalian Springs site in 1878 on the banks of Rocky Creek in what is now Trousdale County, Tennessee. The tablet is wide by tall by and on both sides depicts multiple figures dressed in S.E.C.C. regalia. It is named for Gates P. Thruston, a Nashville lawyer turned avocational archaeologist who excavated many sites in the Nashville area and built up an extensive collection of artifacts, even though he did not discover the stone nor was it ever part of his collection. He did champion the stone and wrote an article for \\"The Antiquities of Tennessee and the Adjacent States\\" journal in 1890 when the tablet was held by the Tennessee Historical Society. It is presently part of the collection of the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville. Myer also found a cache of over thirty engraved shell gorgets, several of which are now held by the N.M.A.I. The most important of the gorgets is carved in what is known as the Eddyville or Braden style, believed to have been associated with the Cahokia polity near Collinsville, Illinois. The gorget depicts a warrior figure holding a ceremonial mace in his left hand and severed head in his right. The figure also has the Forked Eye Surround Motif, the Bellows apron motif and the Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif, all of which are associated with the S.E.C.C. Falcon dancer. Although the design is often shown with the figure upright, holes drilled in the edge of the gorget for its suspension as a neck ornament show it was meant to be seen with the figure oriented sideways, although it is as yet unclear what this may signify. Also in the cache were two Cox style and two Nashville I style gorgets. In 2005 a waterline replacement crew working on the right of way of State Route 25 discovered an intact Cox style gorget carved from a dark gray shale. This artifact is one of a very few Cox style motifs utilized on a material other than marine shell. The Castalian Springs site is also one of only three sites in Middle Tennessee where ceramic sherds of a type known as Angel negative painted have been found. This type of Mississippian culture pottery is typically associated with Angel Phase sites along the Ohio River.

Meyer is best known for his work on the evolution and adaptive radiation of African cichlid fishes, fish-specific genome duplications, molecular phylogenetics of vertebrates, and the role of ecological and sexual selection in speciation.  Education and previous employment  Meyer (left) and Ernst Mayr in Konstanz in 1998 Meyer attended the gymnasium (high school) Katharineum in L√ºbeck. He was an undergraduate at the Universit√§t Marburg (1979‚Äì1982), and completed his undergraduate thesis at the Universit√§t Kiel and the University of Miami, Florida (1982). He received both his master's and PhD from the Department of Zoology at the University of California Berkeley in 1984 and 1988 respectively. He spent one year as a visiting student in Harvard University's Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (1986‚Äì1987). Meyer was an Alfred P. Sloan Postdoctoral Fellow in Molecular Evolution at University of California Berkeley with Allan C. Wilson, before joining the faculty in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook as an assistant professor. In 1993 he received tenure and was promoted to associate professor. Meyer joined the Universit√§t Konstanz Department of Biology as a full professor in 1997.  Communication of science  Meyer is active in the communication of science to the public. He has written more than 70 articles for major German newspapers including Die Zeit and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In addition, he contributed a weekly column, Quantensprung, on matters related to science and evolution to the Handelsblatt from 2005‚Äì2010. The first 100 articles of Quantensprung were published in 2008 in the book Evolution ist √ºberall. In 2008 for his effort in communicating with the public he received the EMBO Award for communication in the Life Sciences. \\"MBO awards the prize annually to a practicing scientist in Europe for outstanding communication with the public.

Labtimes Online . and has been covered by national and international press and media.  Controversies  = Scientific misconduct = In 2003, Meyer was accused of several cases of misconduct in a complaint that was filed by 16 former students and postdocs. The initial accusations included violation of intellectual property rights, plagiarism, disregard of author rights, misappropriation of research funds, fabrication of results, threats against lab members and posting misleading job advertisements, however, most of the allegations could not be confirmed. In reaction to the accusations, the University launched an investigation lead by law professor Dieter Lorenz. The commission published their report in 2004 and found Meyer to be not guilty of any fabrication of results or misappropriation of funds. However, the commission stated Meyer was ‚Äú‚Äòdamaging the scientific interests‚Äô of lab members by, for example, placing ‚Äòmisleading job advertisements‚Äô and ‚Äòblocking the publication of a lab member's paper for more than 2 years.‚Äô\\" The report was also criticized, as the job advertisements in question were placed in accordance to common practice and signed by the rectorate, and because the commission also did not speak to any of the 16 complainants before affirming their accusations. The final report criticized Meyer for not respecting personal matters of research assistants. According to Science, the internal commission reported that ‚ÄúMeyer claimed ownership of other people's intellectual property‚Äù. However, Professor Lorenz, stated that the phrase intellectual property was not meant \\"as a legal term\\". The complainants noted at the time that they were met by institutional resistance from the University of Konstanz and any consequences imposed by the University were never reported. In 2004, 36 of Axel Meyer‚Äôs students, postdocs and scientific collaborators published a letter of support in Nature with the title: ‚ÄûMeyer: disagreements but no misconduct‚Äú. They claimed they ‚Äû[‚Ä¶] were surprised by the committee's decision to accept some of the complaints [‚Ä¶]. Our own experiences of working in or collaborating with Axel Meyer's lab have been far more positive. Those of us who have published with Meyer found that he provided crucial intellectual contributions to manuscripts.‚Äù Furthermore the group underlines: ‚ÄúCollaboration with Meyer took place in a fair, open and cooperative atmosphere.‚Äù = Laziness and dishonesty of students = In 2015, Axel Meyer wrote an article for FAZ (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung) describing German university students as lazy and dishonest. Despite a long history of publicly funded post secondary education in Germany, Meyer argued that the tuition-free education system made today's students spoiled and entitled compared to those in the United States ‚Äì though the US faces increasingly high rates of student debt. Meyer was compelled to write the piece after his office had been broken into two days before an exam. Upon finding markings around the lock to his office at the University of Konstanz he notified the police who informed him that occasionally students attempt to break into offices to steal exams. Though the police also reported that several offices had been compromised for the purpose of stealing cash and no evidence suggested the culprit was a student. Regardless, Meyer contemplates in his article: \\"Would students break into the office of a professor to steal the exam topic?\\" And then goes on to say: \\"At least I would not be surprised if that were the case.\\" One of his most inflammatory statements colorfully illustrates his view of students: ‚ÄúIn jeder Hinsicht wird ihnen der Hintern gepudert und mit viel F√ºrsorge und Verst√§ndnis jede Faulheit und Inkompetenz vergeben‚Äú ‚Äî which translates to ‚ÄúIn every way are their butts carefully powdered and laziness and incompetence is forgiven with care and understanding.‚Äù The rector of the University of Konstanz, Ulrich R√ºdiger, apologized personally and described several passages in Meyer's article as \\"defamatory and insulting,‚Äù suggesting possible consequences for Meyer though no official consequences were reported. In a circular letter of the Rector of the University professors, the rector testified that Meyer had publicly spread several \\"false factual claims about the conditions at the University of Konstanz.‚Äù Meyer apologized for his choice of words but not for his message. Students countered that Meyer himself was not giving his lectures, but rather divvying them up among his PhD students and postdoctoral researchers.  Scientific impact  With an h-index of 110 according to Google Scholar, Axel Meyer is one of the most cited evolutionary biologists in the world. He has published more than 400 peer-reviewed papers in disciplines ranging from zoology, phylogenetics, evolutionary developmental biology, to molecular evolution and comparative genomics, including a 1989 PCR protocol that is a citation classic. Of those, more than 20 scientific articles were published in NATURE, the world‚Äôs most highly cited interdisciplinary science journal, and nine in SCIENCE.

Houses in this neighbourhood are typically owned by a few landlords who then rent out houses to students. Rents are comparatively higher than those of the general area. Most rentable homes are dilapidated, furnished poorly and usually suffering from animal infestation. Due to the developing state of the campus and general area, basic services are poor at best. Fiber internet is not available in this area, and cellphone reception is very poor. However, as of the year 2016 TELEKOM MALAYSIA is now operating the fiber internet and mobile services is now available. History Originally Taman Tasik Semenyih was developed by a low profile Malaysian developer, Bandar Tasik Semenyih Sdn Bhd or BTS Land Capital as an out of town, low density residential development meant for low to middle income people who works in Klang Valley. In the beginning, the town failed to grow as originally envision, with most of the residential and commercial lots undeveloped. However, following the inception and opening of the adjacent university campus. The town has shifted in role and now prominently houses students from the university in the form of off-campus accommodation. Commercial activity is slowly increase albeit at a very slow rate with much of the commercial area still void of any activity. Most of the area is made up of low density residential housing with pockets of medium- density housing. In the early 2010s, with the boom of short-term student housing, numerous house are being converted into student hostels. Typically a three bed room landed house is expanded upon and made into 8-10 room hostel. This has raised the issue of added congestion, noise pollution and general health and safety risk. There is also general worry that sewage lines within the estate may not be able to cope with the increasing amounts of solid waste being made. However, since 2016 Indah Water Sewerage treatment plant located along Jalan TTS1/1 have been upgraded and extended to cope with new developments in the area. Geography There is a small commercial area located to the south of the town. Due to a lack of economic activity and patronage, most of the shops are closed and the area can be classified as a ghost town. A small drain runs along the major arterial road of this town. With the rise in student population, more restaurants have started appearing along this commercial area, particularly to the shophouses located adjacent to the main roads. Restaurants are typically offering middle eastern, south Asian or local cuisine, with most of the international ones offering delivery service. Food prices are typically higher than average. Taman Tasik Semenyih can be further classified into 7 zones: =Taman Tasik Semenyih 1= An intended high income area, of bungalow land lots surrounding a man-made lake. This area comprises 52 bungalow lots ranging from 12,000 sq ft and above. This is the zone with one family club house with a cafeteria open to public, a 20-acre public lake garden and a golf driving range. TTS Tetris Apartments A premium 3 block of 4-storey walk up apartments are located within this area. Designed and built for University of Nottingham Malaysia off-campus students. This area is served frequently by a handful of buses and taxis from the university. =Taman Tasik Semenyih 2= Lower-medium cost terrace houses fill this small area, a number of houses of this area has been converted to student housing, due to the dense nature of hostel occupancy, parking shortage is an increasing problem. =Taman Tasik Semenyih 3= Bungalow lots typically filled with single storey bungalows. Some of these bungalows have been renovated and expanded into 2 storey dwellings and some into student hostels. There at least 5 fraternity and sorority houses located within the area. One of them, dubbed the \\"white house\\" was a former church converted into a hostel. However, since Sept 2013, the \\"white house\\" was closed. This was due to the widespread cases of theft and break-ins that were occurring within the area. =Taman Tasik Semenyih 4= A mixture of bungalow houses and terrace dwellings, generally student populated and very noisy at night. The deeper parts of this zone is gated. Being a middle income area, this area features, a sizable park, a surau (small prayer hall), and is often promoted as a wifi precinct. =Taman Tasik Semenyih 5= The zone of nearest access to campus due to presence of pedestrian bridge. Typically terrace house with lines of 2 storey bungalows, due to location, one of the popular, and highly inflated rent areas. Houses near to the bridge has been openly converted to private student hostels. A converted house in this area tend to have 10-24 beds. Due to the noisy, raucous behaviour of students and the chance to cash in on student rentals there has been a mass exodus of family homes, with estimates of 39.4% homes currently lived by families. While student population over the academic year making up an excess of 62.1% of the living population. TTS EDU Square EDU Square is a collective of semi detached and interlinked terrace buildings, purpose built as student hostels. These were built by BTS Land Capital. Some of these are managed by varying parties. Rent here is comparatively expensive compared to regular TTS accommodation, but is typically viewed as being safer due to the use of permanent private security personnel on-site. Though crime index seems to suggest otherwise. =Taman Tasik Semenyih 6= Low cost terrace area. Unlike the other areas this area, this area is not popular with students and family home still account for 83.4% of the houses. Predominantly a Malay area, this area is made up of low-income residents, ethnic Malay students and staff. =Taman Tasik Semenyih 7= The newest area with upper-medium cost semi detached houses, with inflated rent that is comparable to those in TTS 5. This zone is located at the deep end of the arterial road and is generally opinion- ed as being situated too far from campus. Unlike other areas, which have vestiges of non-student residence. TTS 7 is fully occupied by students. Houses here, are typically rented in sets of whole units, though single rooms are also available.  Geography and climate  The temperature generally ranges from 30 ¬∞C to 34 ¬∞C during the day and 25 ¬∞C to 28 ¬∞C during the night, with cooler temperatures during and after a heavy rainfall. The humidity level is at 80% throughout the year. As such, air conditioning is widely used, causing ambient temperatures within this area to rise above the normal average. As with other places in Malaysia, Taman Tasik Semenyih is in the tropical rainforest climate where there are minimal changes in seasons, however from May till September and January till early March the campus faces a dry season and from mid-November till December a mild wet season. Due to these changes, the changing colours of leaves and the flowering of certain plants may be observed. In late March a tropical variation of cherry blossom may be observed on certain trees from following the dry season. Transportation Taman Tasik Semenyih being a student town has a number of university operated bus services serving the area. The main one is the UNMC-Kajang Shuttle bus service, an hourly bus service. This service is supported by a Semenyih shuttle bus, which provides frequent bus service to this area at certain times of day. Aside from this, this area is also served by the return leg of UNMC-Tesco shuttle services. Similar to most outlying townships in the Klang valley area, this area is not served by any public bus service. Previously, in 2004-2005 a RapidKL service was available but due to poor ridership. The bus route was retracted. Pedestrian sidewalks in Taman Tasik Semenyih are virtually non- existent. Pedestrians are typically expected to share the available road space with vehicles, or walk on grass land.

She became a member of several esoteric societies in London, and was a close friend and co-worker of Anna Kingsford. Biography Isabelle Lace was born in Liverpool, the daughter (and one of seven children) of Joshua Lace, a solicitor. She was educated first in Liverpool, then in Stratford-upon-Avon. In 1861, she married a Swiss cotton merchant, Rudolf Adolf von Steiger von Riggesberg. The couple divided their time between England and Switzerland, then settled down, for professional reasons, in Egypt, where her husband died of Tuberculosis in 1870.Steiger, Isabelle de, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Isabelle de Steiger returned to England in 1874 and studied art, first at the Heatherley School of Fine Art, then at the Slade School of Fine Art in London. Having obtained her degree, she began a career as a professional painter, going on to exhibit at various galleries, such as the Royal Academy in London, and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. Her style was strongly influenced by Lawrence Alma-Tadema and his historical paintings, such as Cleopatra after the Battle of Actium etc. She was also known for her flower painting and book illustrations. She illustrated, for example, the occult magazine The Unknown World (1894-1895), edited by A. E. Waite.The Unknown World (Answers.com). She painted some figures in the Theosphical movement but unfortunately much of her work was destroyed in a fire. She also experienced the prevailing prejudice against women which made it difficult to rent studio space and attend life classes, as well as social obstacles to women having an independent career.Holden, 1983 In the early 1870s, Steiger was drawn towards spiritualism and in 1878 joined the Theosophical Society. She came into contact with Madame Blavatsky, Mabel Collins and Anna Kingsford, the latter being especially esteemed by Steiger and becoming a close friend. Later, after a split within the Theosophical society, she became a member of the Hermetic Society, founded by Kingsford; she was also a member of the Society for Psychical Research. Steiger became a friend of the alchemist Mary Anne Atwood, and her own writings were also strongly influenced by Alchemy; on Atwood's death, in 1910, she successfully republished Atwood's principal work, A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery. She joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1888, and, after a factional split of the society in 1903, left with A. E. Waite, joining his \\"Holy Order of the Golden Dawn\\", despite their disagreements on the subject of Alchemy. She also founded, in 1912, an Alchemical Society. Towards the end of her life she followed the teachings of Anthroposophy.Pert, Alan. Red Cactus: The Life of Anna Kingsford (Alan Pert, 2006) p. 80.. Steiger wrote several books on mystical subjects, including a translation of Karl von Eckartshausen's \\"Cloud upon the Sanctuary\\", and an autobiography. She also wrote articles which appeared in various journals. She died in Rock Ferry, Cheshire in January 1927.

The targets were a convoy of civil guards who were escorting workers and weapons from the nearby Esperanza y Cia Arms factory to Bilbao. A total of six civil guards were killed, while two ETA members were killed by hand grenades that they had thrown. The attack was the deadliest of 1980, the year when ETA killed more people than any other.Timeline: Eta campaign, BBC News, 8 September 2010 accessed 17 February 2010 The attack The attack occurred on a Friday morning. ETA had observed similar convoys from the factory and planned their ambush based on information that they had gathered. The convoy consisted of four vehicles, the first carrying technicians, the third mortar devices produced by the factory and the second and fourth vehicles carrying three civil guards each.Seis guardias civiles mueren ametrallados en Vizcaya, La Vanguardia, 2 February 1980, p5-6 The vehicle left the factory at 7:30 am and at approximately 8:15 am, had to slow down at a part of the road which consisted of numerous bends. The ETA members had chosen a spot near a small hill, where they were hidden from view by dense vegetation. After allowing the vehicle carrying the factory workers to pass, ETA launched a grenade at the second vehicle, causing it to be stuck in a layby and then attacked the civil guard's vehicles with assault rifles, machine guns and grenades, firing over 100 shots. In order to ensure that no civil guards survived, the ETA members approached the vehicles and threw a hand grenade into the first civil guard's vehicle. When they repeated this with the second vehicle, two ETA members, Gregorio Olabarr√≠a Gorrotxategui Bengoa and Javier Argote, were killed as a result of injuries suffered when they failed to escape in time before the grenades exploded.ETA, una historia de muerte y destrucci√≥n, Diario Vasco, 23 March 2006 accessed 16 February 2011 One of these was subsequently found 6 kilometres away from the attack, having apparently been moved there by his comrades. At 8:45 am, a man had approached a bar near the scene and had asked in Basque for medical assistance. The drivers of the third vehicle, which had been trapped between the civil guard's vehicles, were allowed to go free and ordered to go down the hill by the ETA members, where they eventually reached a main road. The weapons in the third vehicle were seized by the ETA team. Having been alerted by a local resident who had heard the gunfire and explosions, the police arrived on the scene at 9:00 am and found a large quantity of grenades, 9 millimetre ammunition and guns of Belgian origin. Reactions The attack took place at a time when devolution of power to the Basque autonomous region was imminent, with the first elections taking place one month later. The attack was condemned by the Basque General Council, the forerunner of the modern Basque government, and most of the region's main parties like the Basque Nationalist Party, Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), Euskadiko Ezkerra and the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD). During the funeral of one of the ETA members killed in the attack, Gregorio Olabarr√≠a, the priest gave a homily attacking ETA violence. For this he was heckled by some of those attending the funeral who shouted slogans in support of the group such as \\"Gora ETA!\\"Vivas a ETA en el funeral del terrorista muerto en el atentado de Lequeitio, El Pais, 5 February 1980 There were also disturbances at the funeral of the six civil guards. Protestors shouted insults at Government ministers, who had to be protected by a police cordon. Members of the press and the PSOE were not allowed to attend the funerals, though members of the UCD and Popular Alliance were in attendance.Bilbao: Tensi√≥n en los funerales de los seis guardias civiles, La Vanguardia, 3 February 1980, p14 Arrests and judicial processes On 25 June 1982, five people, Francisco Esquisavel, Angel Recalde, Jes√∫s Trocaola, Juan Ram√≥n Ibarlueca, Ana Guerenabarrena and Mar√≠a Isabel Mendiola appeared in court accused of having participated or cooperated in the attack. Esquisavel and Recalde were accused of direct participation while Trocaola was accused of having sheltered ETA fugitives who had taken part. Mendiola was accused of having driven a get away car for one of those involved in the attack while Ibarlueca and Guerenabarrena were accused of having cleaned away blood stains from a car used.Juicio por el atentado de Isp√°ster, donde murieron 6 guardias civiles, El Pais, 26 June 1982 accessed 16 February 2011 In 1984, Jaime Rementer√≠a Beotegui was found guilty of participation in the attack, fined 60 million pesetas, and sentenced to prison. Having been in prison since August 1983, he was released in January 2004.Todas las vidas rotas, Diario de Burgos, 31 January 2010 Francisco Esquisavel was also found guilty of participation and was released from prison in 2002 after 22 years incarceration. In 1999, the only outstanding case was settled. Jose Luis Ansola Larranaga (\\"Peio the Elder\\") was acquitted of involvement in the attack on the basis of lack of evidence. The Chief Prosecutor, Eduardo Fungairi√±o, and the Association of Victims of Terrorism had alleged that Ansola had been the author of the operation and had requested 174 years in prison for him.El etarra Peio el Viejo, libre tras ser absuelto por falta de pruebas, El Pais, 22 June 1999 accessed 16 February 2011 Subsequent attacks On 13 July 1980, ETA attempted to repeat the tactics of the Ispaster attack with an ambush at Orio. However, after killing 2 civil guards, the ETA unit was counter-attacked by civil guards, resulting in the deaths of two ETA members.

He is best known for his arrangement for cello and piano of C√©sar Franck's Violin Sonata in A major. Musicologist Lynda MacGregor described Delsart as \\"one of the foremost French cellists of the period, with faultless technique, a precise bow and a sweet, though not large, tone.\\" He was the owner of the 1689 'Archinto' Stradivari. Life and career Born in Valenciennes in 1844, Delsart began his studies at the Acad√©mie de Musique in his native city before transferring to the Conservatoire de Paris, where he earned a First Prize in cello performance in 1866.Van der Straeten, pg 535 His principal teacher was Auguste Franchomme, whom he succeeded as professor of cello at the Conservatoire upon Franchomme's death in 1884. He remained in that position for the rest of his life. His students included Paul Bazelaire, Horace Britt, Marcel Casadesus, Louis Feuillard, Louis Fournier, V√≠ctor Mirecki Larramat, Henri Mulet, and Georges Papin. Following his graduation from the Paris Conservatoire, Delsart embarked on several successful tours throughout Europe. On 26 February 1881 he premiered in the Salle Pleyel the cello sonata of Marie Ja√´ll, with the composer playing the piano. In 1882 she dedicated her cello concerto to him. He made numerous appearances in London, including performing in the world premiere of David Popper's Requiem for three cellos and orchestra alongside the composer and Edward Howell as his fellow cellists at St James's Hall on 25 November 1891. In 1892, at La Trompette, accompanied by Louis Breitner, he premiered Chant saphique, Op. 91, a piece for cello and piano by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, which was dedicated to him. Other works dedicated to Delsart included David Popper's Nocturne, L√©on Bo√´llmann's Cello Sonata, and Benjamin Godard's On the Lake. Delsart was also active as a chamber musician. From 1875, along with the founder Martin Pierre Marsick, Louis van Waefelghem and Guillaume R√©my, he was the cellist of the Quatuor Marsick, one of the best and most famous string quartets in Paris of the time.Cobbett, page 435 With Andr√© Messager and Guillaume R√©my, he played in a piano trio which premiered Ernest Chausson's Trio in G minor, Op. 3, in 1882.Cobbett, page 266 He also played in a trio led by Pablo de Sarasate.Applebaum, page 283 In addition to the cello, Delsart occasionally performed on the viola da gamba, which he began studying in 1887. His interest in this instrument led him to found the Soci√©t√© des Instruments Anciens (SIA) with Louis Di√©mer (harpsichord), van Waefelghem (viola d'amore) and Grillet (vielle) in 1889. The SIA performed successfully throughout Europe for a decade, although Delsart was only a member during its early years. He was succeeded in the Soci√©t√© by two of his pupils, Papin and Casadesus. Delsart died in Paris in 1900, aged 55, and was buried at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. During his lifetime, his portrait was painted by Jean-Andr√© Rixens and Julien Decle; both paintings are in the Mus√©e des Beaux Arts, Valenciennes.Collections: Delsart pp. 1 at Culture:fr, retrieved 26 February 2011 There is a Rue Jules Delsart in Valenciennes. Arrangements Delsart's arrangement for cello and piano of C√©sar Franck's Violin Sonata in A major was sanctioned by the composer, and has become a standard part of the cello repertoire. After thorough historical study based on reliable documents, Delsart's transcription for cello (the piano part remains the same as in the violin sonata) was published by G. Henle Verlag as Urtext edition. He also arranged for cello and piano the M√©ditation from Massenet's Tha√Øs (normally played by violin and orchestra); and Faur√©'s Three Romances sans paroles, Op. 17, for piano.

During the 1920s and 1930s Kravchenko was a staff actress with Mezhrabpom Film Studio. She enjoyed a stellar career in Soviet silent films. Kravchenko was married to popular actor Andrei Fajt, and the couple was part of Moscow cultural milieu during the 1920s and early 1930s. During the 1930s she was married to the son of the powerful Soviet leader, Lev Kamenev, who was a political opponent of Joseph Stalin. After the party leader Sergey Kirov was assassinated on 1 December 1934, Kamenev was secretly tried and sentenced, on false accusations for having contributed to the crime. In August 1936, however, Kamenev and Zinovyev were tried again in the first public-show trial of the Great Purge. Accused of conspiring to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, Kamenev was brutally pressured and eventually confessed to the fabricated charges in the vain hope of saving his family. He was shot, and his wife perished in the Gulag. Five decades later, Lev Kamenev was cleared of charges by the Soviet Supreme Court in 1988. Kravchenko suffered a blow to her acting career and personal life. She was censored under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin, and was practically unemployed for more than 20 years. After the death of Stalin, Kravchenko returned to Moscow and struggled to survive until the late 1950s, when Nikita Khrushchev initiated the \\"Thaw\\" in cultural life in the Soviet Union. At that time, Kravchenko was an almost forgotten aging actress, and her career was limited to playing bit parts as mothers and grandmothers in low-budget Soviet films.¬´–ú–æ–∑–∞–∏–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—à–ª–æ–≥–æ¬ª –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–π—Ç–µ Google Books–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –≤–µ—Ö–∏ –ì. –°. –ö—Ä–∞–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ Kravchenko made a comeback as Maria Lvovna Kuragina, the omnipresent socialite in War and Peace (1967) by director Sergei Bondarchuk.

She later wrote a book of memoirs describing her joy of working with Bondarchuk in War and Peace. Kravchenko was designated Honorable Actress of Russia in 1980. Both her late husband and her father-in-law, Lev Kamenev, were posthumously cleared of all charges during Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms. Kravchenko died on 5 March 1996 in Moscow.

Preliminary history  In the 1820s, the Saint-Simonists got caught by the idea of creating a canal between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. In 1833, Enfantin and some of his followers travelled to Egypt hoping, amongst other matters, to further this idea. He did not succeed in getting the Khedive Muhammad Ali Pasha to be interested, but was able to discuss his ideas with the French consul de Lesseps, with Linant de Bellefonds, a high ranking engineer in the Egyptian public works administration, and with lieutenant Waghorn, the developer of the Overland Route. He returned to Paris in 1836 after some of his followers working on the Delta Barrage had died from plague. Although disappointed by the result of that journey, Enfantin kept the idea alive over the following ten years.  The Society  Members of the society set up by Enfantin in 1846 were the French Enfantin, Arl√®s-Dufour, Jules, Lon and Paulin Talabot, the British Robert Stephenson and Edward Starbuck, the Austrian Alois Negrelli, inspector of the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway, and Feronce and Sellier of Leipzig as representatives of the German interest. The office of the Society was located at Enfantin's private house. The Society was not intended to be a purely private matter, but was seen as a semi official commission supported by the Khedive and by Linant-Bey in the public works department.Wilson, Arnold T. (1939). The Suez Canal. 2nd ed., London: Oxford University Press In September 1847, the Society sent three groups of engineers and surveyors to Egypt. The groups led by Stephenson and Negrelli explored the coastal areas. Paul-Adrien Bourdaloue and his group, commissioned by Talabot, proceeded at the survey and leveling of the Istmus of Suez. They found that the difference in levels between the Mediterranean and Red Sea was negligible,Coversheet of the report of the French group contrary to the conclusions of Jacques-Marie Le P√®re, an engineer on Bonaparte's Egyptian Expedition, who had calculated a difference of some 9 m.Jacques-Marie Le P√®re, M√©moire sur la communication de la mer des Indes √† la M√©diterran√©e par la mer Rouge et l'Isthme de Sueys, in Description de l'√âgypte, √âtat moderne I (p. 37‚Äì370, leveling difference on p. 336), Imprimerie Imp√©riale, Paris, 1809 (Volume 11), on Google books Following the revolutions of 1848, the increasing importance of railways, the lack of interest of the British members and the death of Muhammad Ali Pasha, the society was limited in its influence and activity in Egypt. The former viceroy of the Ottoman Empire in Egypt, Muhammad Ali, died in 1848, and his position went to his grandson Abbas, who was not open to foreign influence. It was not until Abbas' assassination in 1854 and control passed to his uncle, Sa'id, that interest again was spurred in a canal, this time under the sole influence of Ferdinand de Lesseps - who corresponded at least once with the Soci√©t√© and gained details about a canal plan in the intervening period, and, who had also acted as a mentor of Sa'id when Sa'id was a young man.

It covers and runs from the Tennessee-Georgia state line in Bradley County to Dayton joining US 27. Route description =Bradley County= SR 60 begins at the Georgia border in Bradley County, heading north on two-lane Dalton Pike, a primary state route. At the state line, the route continues into Whitfield County, Georgia as SR 71 (Cleveland Highway) to Dalton. From the border, SR 60 passes a mix of hilly farmland and woodland as it reaches a junction with SR 317. The route continues through the agricultural valley, entering the community of Waterville. Continuing northeast, the road enters Cleveland and passes residential development as it turns to the north. SR 60 heads into commercial areas and intersection with McGrady Drive, a connector to APD-40 (US 64 Bypass/US 74, SR 311). The road heads northwest into residential areas, turning north into business areas, and intersects SR 74 (Spring Place Road S.E.). TDOT lists the route as turning southeast to form a concurrency with Spring Place Road, but it is signed as continuing north with SR 74 at this intersection along Wildwood Avenue SE. and then east with US 64 to the interchange with APD-40. S.R. 60 as part of APD-40 near the interchange with 20th Street NE. At this point, SR 60 splits from SR 74 by heading north along APD-40 on a four-lane divided highway, becoming a primary route again. The road passes through wooded areas near some residential development, bypassing Cleveland to the east. Upon reaching a cloverleaf interchange with US 64/US 74 (SR 40), US 64 Bypass terminates and SR 60 continues north as a freeway. The route comes to an interchange with Benton Pike before coming to the Overhead Bridge Road exit, at which point the freeway widens to six lanes, influenced by the exit ramps at each end of a long bridge. SR 60 passes over a Norfolk Southern railroad line and interchanges with 20th Street NE, making a turn to the northwest and narrowing back to four lanes. The road then enters the metropolis of Cleveland, passing developed areas of homes and businesses as it becomes a surface road again, and APD-40 ends. SR 60 comes to intersections with US 11 (SR 74, Ocoee Street) and US 11 Bypass (SR 2, Keith Street) in this area, becoming 25th Street. The road passes through a patch of woods before passing more commercial establishments as it comes to the I-75 interchange. At this point, SR 60 turns north and becomes Georgetown Road, a secondary route that passes through residential areas, where it narrows into a two-lane undivided road. The route comes to an intersection with Paul Huff Parkway, and leaves Cleveland, heading into a mix of farmland and woodland before passing near more residential and commercial areas as it comes to the SR 306 junction in Hopewell. Following this, the road continues northwest through forested areas with some farm fields and residences. SR 60 continues into more agricultural areas before it becomes the border between Meigs County to the northeast and Hamilton County to the southwest. =Hamilton and Meigs Counties= S.R. 60 in Georgetown at the Bradley-Hamilton-Meigs County line. The route passes through Georgetown, where it passes a few residences and businesses. A short distance past Georgetown, SR 60 passes crosses onto the Hamilton-Meigs County line, passing through more rural areas as an unnamed road and comes to a junction with SR 58. The road passes through more agricultural and wooded areas, turning to the north and entering more forested surroundings. After a turn to the northwest, the route continues through wooded areas with a few farm fields fully within Hamilton County, reaching an intersection with SR 312 (Birchwood Pike). At this point, SR 60 turns north again and passes through the residential community of Birchwood. From here, the road becomes Hiwassee Highway and curves northwest into farmland with some woods and homes, crossing into Meigs County. =Rhea County= Upon crossing the Tennessee River on the Tri-County Veterans Bridge, SR 60 enters Rhea County and turns north into forested areas with a few farms. The road continues to wind through rural areas with some residential development before SR 60 reaches its northern terminus at US 27 (SR 29) in Dayton. History In Cleveland, the route originally turned south about 1/4 mile east of the interchange with I-75 onto a road which is still called Georgetown Road, and briefly ran together with US 64 through downtown Cleveland before splitting off onto Wildwood Avenue. It was moved onto 25th Street after it was widened to four lanes in the mid 1960s and APD-40 after that section was completed in 1974. Originally, the route did not cross the Tennessee river into Rhea County, and commuters used Blythe Ferry, which dated back to the early 1800s. In 1994, the current bridge across the river was completed, and Blythe Ferry closed. Between late 2010 and early 2013, Dalton Pike was widened to five lanes and straightened out south of the intersection with McGrady Drive. The original route was a hazardous two-lane road with several dangerous curves prone to accidents. In 2016, the parallel bridges on APD-40 across 20th Street, the railroad, and Overhead Bridge Road were designated as the Dustin Ledford Memorial Bridge in honor of a man who was killed by an intoxicated driver near the Overhead Bridge Road exit. TDOT has begun right-of-way acquisition to widen the route to four lanes between Cleveland and the intersection with SR 306. This project has been proposed since at least 2009.

Initially working as a teacher in Butzbach, he then spent a short time as a pastor in Ober-Gleen, a district of Gie√üen. In what is now Hesse and the Middle Rhine, he was one of the main figures of the Vorm√§rz and a pioneer of the 1848 Revolution. Biography Weidig was born in the Oberkleen district, Langg√∂ns, northwest of Wetterau. The son of a chief forester and his wife, her maiden name being Liebknecht. He went to Butzbach in 1803 to go to school. During his theological studies in the Ludoviciana in Gie√üen he was a member of the 'fr√§nkischen Landsmannschaft'.Eduard Ey√üen: Das Stammbuch eines Gie√üener Franken von 1810. In: Deutsche Corpszeitung 41 (1925), S. 248. In 1812 he became headmaster at the boys' school in Butzbach. Following Friedrich Ludwig Jahn's example, Weidig taught his pupils drill and physical exercise and in 1814 founded a parade ground on the Schrenzer, a north-eastern foothill of the Taunus - later historians and biographers thus called him the \\"father of Hessian drill\\". From 1818 Weidig was monitored by the authorities for his political activities in teaching, preaching and in private - he was one of the liberal democrats who aspired to establish Germany as a unified democratic nation state. In 1832 he thus travelled to south-west Germany and helped in the preparations for the Hambach Festival. In 1833 Weidig was arrested for the first time, but in 1834 he still published four illegal issues of \\"Leuchter und Beleuchter f√ºr Hessen (oder der Hessen Notwehr)\\". The same year saw his first meeting with Georg B√ºchner, with whom he worked on a manuscript that Weidig then published against B√ºchner's wishes as Hessischen Landboten. Weidig and his students also organised the printing and distribution of illegal pamphlets. On 5 April 1834 Weidig was suspended from his teaching post and demoted to a small village called Ober-Gleen, now in Kirtorf, im Vogelsberg. When the \\"Hessischen Landboten\\" project was betrayed in summer 1834, B√ºchner fled to Stra√üburg but Weidig refused to emigrate to Switzerland with his family. Soon afterwards he was arrested in the Klosterkaserne barracks in Friedberg and in June 1835 put into house arrest in Darmstadt, where on 23 February 1837 he committed suicide after two years' questioning and physical abuse by state investigators, including Konrad Georgi, a known alcoholic. Ill and desperate, he had written letters to his wife from prison, which were retained by his questioners \\"for state-political reasons\\" for many years after his death. His friends noted on his gravestone that he was a freedom fighter, but this was bricked up by the authorities. Namesakes The Weidigschule gymnasium-school in Butzbach is named after him, as is the Weidigsporthalle in Oberkleen.  Bibliography Weidig, Friedrich Ludwig: Gesammelte Schriften.

He was named People's Artist of the USSR in 1961Rostislav Yanovich Plyatt from the Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979) and awarded the USSR State Prize in 1982. Biography Born in Rostov-on-Don (modern-day Rostov Oblast of Russia) as Rostislav Ivanovich Plyat, the future actor was so obsessed with theatre that he decided to \\"correct\\" his name at the passport office to make it more euphonious and memorable. His father, Ivan Iosifovich Plyat, was a lawyer of Polish descent, \\"although a very russified one\\". His Ukrainian mother Zinaida Pavlovna Zakamennaya came from Poltava and died eight years later from tuberculosis. Ivan Plyat then moved to Moscow where he married Anna Nikolaevna Volikovskaya who raised Rostislav as her own son. He was baptized in Russian Orthodoxy and spoke Russian language only.Rostislav Plyatt (1991). Without an Epilogue. ‚Äî Moscow: Iskusstvo, pp. 7‚Äî96 (Memoirs) Plyatt studied in the Moscow secondary school where he visited drama classes led by a popular Maly Theatre actor Vladimir Lebedev and then ‚Äî by a Moscow Art Theatre actress Varvara Sokolova-Zalesskaya who introduced him to the basics of the Stanislavski's system. After that he decided to become a professional actor and in 1926 unsuccessfully tried to join the Moscow Art Theatre troupe. He then entered the Theatre-Studio led by Yuri Zavadsky where he spent the next 11 years, performing in mostly comedy roles, although with years he established himself as a serious drama actor. Among his lifetime roles was George Bernard Shaw whom he portrayed in 1933 in The Devil's Disciple and then reprised in 1963 in both Caesar and Cleopatra (where he also played Caesar) and Jerome Kilty's Dear Liar: A Comedy of Letters.Leonard Conolly, Ellen Pearson (1991).

In 1943 he moved to the Mossovet Theatre where he had served for the rest of his life. He was known for his long-lasting friendship with Faina Ranevskaya, and they reguraly performed together in both plays and movies. They appeared in two leading roles in the popular The Rest Is Silence play, the Mossovet stage adaptation of Make Way for Tomorrow where Ranevskaya performed till the end of her career; Plyatt's Barkley Cooper is universally praised as the peak of his acting skills.Rostislav Plyatt at the official Mossovet Theatre website (in Russian) Among Plyatt's famous movie roles were Bubentsov in Grigori Aleksandrov's Spring (1947), Petukhov in A Groom from the Other World (1958) and flat owner in Strictly Business (1962), both by Leonid Gaidai, Dankevich in Sergey Mikaelyan's Going Inside a Storm (1965) and pastor Schlag in Tatyana Lioznova's Seventeen Moments of Spring mini-series (1973). He also worked a lot as a voice actor, narrating films and cartoons, dubbing foreign movies and performing in radio plays.

It runs to Cogload Junction (east of Taunton) where it joins the Bristol to Exeter and Penzance line. Since 1906 it has served as the principal route from London Paddington to Devon and Cornwall, having been built by the Great Western Railway (GWR) joining up several earlier railway lines. These included the Berks and Hants Railway from Reading to and part of the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway from to . The section from Reading to Westbury is sometimes called the \\"Berks and Hants Line\\". History The GWR's cut-off lines to the west of England (shown in red). The Great Western Railway first ran trains from London to Plymouth in 1848. These trains ran via Bristol. The London and South Western Railway completed the rival West of England line in 1860, which provided a more direct route from London to Exeter. The GWR's longer route via Bristol became nicknamed the \\"Great Way Round\\" (after its initials GWR). The direct line from Reading to Taunton was created from three earlier routes. These had been created by companies that had been absorbed into the GWR: *The Berks and Hants Railway's route between Reading and Pewsey, which was part of a route that was extended west to Devizes and Trowbridge. The line was opened as a branch to Hungerford in 1847, then extended west in 1862. *The Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway's route between Westbury and Castle Cary, which was part of a route from Chippenham to Weymouth. These sections opened in stages from 1848 to 1856. *The Bristol and Exeter Railway's route between Langport and Taunton, which was part of the branch to Yeovil they had opened in 1853. The first step of creating the direct line was in 1900 when the Stert and Westbury Railway was built from Patney and Chirton (west of Pewsey) to Westbury. In addition to being part of creating a long-distance line from Reading to Taunton, it also created a shorter GWR route from London to Weymouth. The last stage to be built was the Langport and Castle Cary Railway from Castle Cary to Taunton. This route shared some of the route of the Yeovil‚ÄìTaunton line west of Langport, but joined the existing main line further south at Cogload Junction. This route opened on 2 July 1906. The various sections of line were opened: * Reading to ‚Äì 21 December 1847 *Hungerford to ‚Äì 11 November 1862 *Patney & Chirton to , Wiltshire ‚Äì 29 July 1900 (the Stert and Westbury Railway) *Westbury to , Somerset ‚Äì 7 October 1850 *Frome to ‚Äì 1 September 1856 *Castle Cary to ‚Äì 2 July 1905 *Charlton Mackrell to ‚Äì 20 May 1906 goods trains, 2 July 1906 passenger trains *Somerton to Curry Rivel Junction ‚Äì 12 February 1906 goods trains, 2 July 1906 passenger trains *Curry Rivel Junction to Athelney Junction ‚Äì 1 October 1853 as part of Taunton to Yeovil line *Athelney Junction to Cogload Junction ‚Äì 2 April 1906 *Cogload Junction to ‚Äì 1 June 1842 In 1933, bypass lines were built at Westbury and Frome.R Tourret, GWR Engineering Work 1928‚Äì1938, Tourret Publishing, Abingdon, 2003, The Great Western was nationalised on 1 January 1948 as part of the new British Railways (BR). Resignalling in the 1980s enabled faster running. This was followed by privatisation in the 1990s, with the line being transferred first to Railtrack and then to its successor Network Rail. In 1977 the Parliamentary Select Committee on Nationalised Industries recommended considering electrification of the BR network, and by 1979 BR presented a range of options that included electrifying numerous Western Region routes including Reading to Taunton line by 2000. Under the 1979‚Äì90 Conservative governments that succeeded the 1976‚Äì79 Labour government the proposal was not implemented. Route =Reading to Bedwyn= ;Communities served: Reading‚ÄìTheale‚ÄìAldermaston‚ÄìMidgham and Woolhampton‚ÄìThatcham‚ÄìNewbury‚ÄìKintbury‚ÄìHungerford‚ÄìGreat Bedwyn After Reading railway station the line curves to the left to follow the route of the old Berks and Hants Railway. The Great Western Main Line is on the right and between the two routes is the former Reading TMD, now an engineering depot. Just beyond the depot lies Reading West, a local station that is elevated above a road at one end but is in a deep cutting at the other. At the far end of the cutting is Southcote Junction where the line to Plymouth curves sharply to the right away from the other Berks and Hants Line to Basingstoke. A third line used to curve to the left to a goods depot but this is long closed and the trackbed blocked by a footpath. The route, which is marketed as the \\"Kennet Line\\", follows the River Kennet through the outer suburbs of Reading to Theale. The line passes through Berkshire countryside and local stations at Aldermaston, Midgham and Thatcham. Newbury race course lies alongside the line on the left and has its own station a short distance east of the main Newbury railway station, where the town centre is close by on the right of the line. The station has a bay platform on the right for local terminating trains, and the through platforms are on loop lines that allow fast trains to overtake the local services that continue beyond the town. Some long distance trains also call here. Beyond Newbury the railway follows the route of the Kennet and Avon Canal which crosses below to run on the left side of the line through Kintbury then crosses back to the right before it reaches Hungerford. The line crosses into Wiltshire and the canal crosses back to the left to run close beside the line through Little Bedwyn to reach Bedwyn railway station which is actually in Great Bedwyn. This is the outer limit of the London suburban services and there is a turn-back siding on the right just beyond the station. =On to Taunton= ;Communities served: Pewsey‚ÄìWestbury‚ÄìFrome‚ÄìBruton‚ÄìCastle Cary‚ÄìTaunton Long distance trains continue to follow the Kennet and Avon Canal which runs along the line. Beam engines are preserved at Crofton Pumping Station that once pumped water to the summit level of the canal. The canal goes beneath the line in a tunnel beneath the site of the closed Savernake Low Level railway station, and the remains of the bridge that carried the Midland and South Western Junction Railway. There was never a station at Burbage but the siding served a wharf which allowed transhipment of goods between the canal and railway. Some trains call at Pewsey railway station, where one platform building is a replica of an earlier building but the building on the main platform is original. The site of Patney and Chirton railway station marks the start of a cut-off line that avoided the long loop (to the right) through Devizes railway station on the Berks and Hants Extension Railway. A westbound service from London passing Westbury with the Westbury White Horse in the background Approaching Westbury, non-stop trains curve to the left to pass under the Wessex Main Line and avoid the complex of junctions around the station, but trains that call here diverge to the right at Heywood Road Junction. Another line curves sharply to the right to join the Wessex Main Line towards Trowbridge at Hawkeridge Junction, a route that forms a diversionary route for the Great Western Main Line. The line curves left past the Panel Signal Box to join the Wessex Main Line in the opposite direction and enter the station. There are sidings on both sides of the line west of the station. On the right are those used for stabling the local DMUs between services, and a Network Rail distribution centre for ballast. The sidings on the left are mainly used by stone trains from Mendips quarries further west along the line. Our line diverges right from the Wessex Main Line (which continues towards Salisbury) and curves around behind the virtual quarry to reach Fairwood Junction where trains that avoided the station rejoin the historic route, which here was constructed by the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway. Crossing from Wiltshire into Somerset, the line passes through Clink Road Junction, where a branch line diverges on the right to Frome railway station, where a rare wooden train shed survives, and Whatley Quarry. Frome is served by Heart of Wessex Line local services but few long-distance trains call there instead of following the avoiding line to Blatchbridge Junction. The next junction on the right is at Witham, where the old East Somerset Railway carries stone trains from Merehead Quarry and continues to Cranmore. After passing through Bruton railway station, the line passes the remains of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway at Cole, and then arrives at the junction station at Castle Cary. Here it curves right, away from the Heart of Wessex Line which continues to Weymouth via Yeovil Pen Mill, a diversionary route that is used when the usual route to Exeter is blocked. The main line is now on the Langport and Castle Cary Railway that opened on 2 July 1906 to shorten the so-called \\"Great Way Round\\" via Bristol. After passing through Somerton Tunnel the line soon finds itself crossing the low-lying and comes onto the Somerset Levels and on to Langport and Curry Rivel Junction, where the old Yeovil branch line. used to join from the left, only to diverge right at Athelney to join the Bristol to Taunton Line at Durston. The 1906 openings saw an additional cut-off from Athelney to Cogload Junction where the line joins the route from Bristol, the old Bristol and Exeter Railway. The Taunton and Bridgwater Canal runs alongside the railway. The line passes the site of Creech St Michael railway station and the junction of the former Chard Branch Line. Current services High Speed Train crosses Langport Viaduct (between Castle Cary and Taunton). Passenger services on the route are operated by Great Western Railway (GWR). These are principally Class 802s from London Paddington to Plymouth, or . There is also an overnight Night Riviera sleeper service. Some other services between these places are routed between Reading and Taunton along the Great Western Main Line to Bristol, and then on to the Bristol to Taunton Line, thereby missing this Reading to Taunton line entirely. A few services from London travel only part way along the line, terminating at Westbury or Frome. GWR also provide local services along parts of the line, between Reading and Bedwyn, and between Westbury and Castle Cary. Infrastructure The route is double-track throughout, with passing loops at certain locations. The highest line-speed on the route is . The route has a loading gauge clearance of W7 except Reading to Westbury which is the larger W8, and is open to rolling stock up to Route Availability 8. Signalling requires four minutes between trains on most of the route, but 8 minutes approaching Cogload Junction. Signalling is by multiple-aspect signals, controlled from panel signal boxes at Reading, Westbury and Exeter, and level- crossing boxes at Colthrop (near Thatcham) and Kintbury. Most of the signals are three-aspect, but some sections of two- or four-aspect signalling also exist. During 2010, control of the area signalled by Reading panel transferred to a new Thames Valley Signalling Control Centre at Didcot. = 2007 plans = The Network Rail Business Plan (2007) says the heaviest traffic flows are on the section through Newbury, from where there is large commuter traffic to London. The main pinch-point is between Reading West and Southcote Junction where the route is shared with trains to and from Basingstoke and south-coast ports. It was forecast in the report that demand for journeys towards London can be met up to 2016 by increased service levels; three trains each hour will be needed to the west of England. By 2026 seating demand was forecast to be in excess of capacity from as far west as Westbury, and by as much as 14%. Plans for the route included making the down loop at Newbury Racecourse reversible to improve train handling on race days; the extension of the turnback siding at Bedwyn to accommodate six-car DMUs; increase line speed as far as Cogload Junction; a third track from there and direct access to the northern bay platform at Taunton. =Electrification= The section between Reading and Newbury was earmarked for electrification as part of a scheme to electrify the Great Western Main Line, to allow commuter services to use electrically powered trains to run the entire distance from London Paddington to Newbury. A 2009 DfT white paper called for electric services beyond Reading to be operated by cascaded and completely modernised Class 387 commuter trains from the end of 2018. This would allow the existing DMUs that operate on this section to be cascaded to the Bristol area, the South West and Northern England. Electrification from Reading to Newbury was completed in January 2019. As part of this work, changes were made to the layout of Reading station which included the building of a bridge to carry the main lines of the Reading to Didcot route over the Plymouth to Reading line to remove conflicts between the two routes. An additional four platforms were built on the north side of Reading station for the relief lines, allowing the existing platforms to be used mostly by fast trains between London and the West. The improved station was officially opened by the Queen in July 2014, and railway upgrades in the area were completed in the summer of 2015.  Accidents  Serious incidents on the line include: * Taunton train fire, Somerset ‚Äì sleeping car fire, 6 July 1978. * Ufton Nervet derailment, Berkshire ‚Äì fatalities following a collision with a car that had stopped on a level crossing, 6 November 2004.

It is a major branch of the Great Western Main Line and runs from Exeter to Plymouth, from where it continues as the Cornish Main Line. It was one of the principal routes of the Great Western Railway which in 1948 became part of the Western Region of British Railways and are now part of the Network Rail system. History The line only became a through route on 2 July 1906 when the Langport and Castle Cary Railway was completed. Before this, from 5 May 1848, through trains from London to Plymouth had run via : this is often called the \\"Great Way Round\\" and a few trains still take this route. The various sections of line were opened: *Exeter to - 30 May 1846 *Teignmouth to Newton - 30 December 1846 * Newton to - 20 July 1847 * Totnes to - 5 May 1848 * Laira to Plymouth - 2 April 1849 The entire line between Exeter and Plymouth was built by the South Devon Railway Company. The nominally independent companies had all been amalgamated into the Great Western Railway by 1 February 1876, and the remaining broad gauge lines were closed on 20 May 1892 and converted to standard gauge over the following weekend. A series of cut- off lines were constructed during the following 15 years which saw the through route established. The Great Western was nationalised on 1 January 1948 as part of the new British Railways. In 1977 the Parliamentary Select Committee on Nationalised Industries recommended considering electrification of more of Britain's rail network, and by 1979 BR presented a range of options to do so by 2000. Some included electrifying the Bristol to Exeter line, Exeter to Plymouth Line, Riviera Line and Cornish Main Line. Under the 1979‚Äì90 Conservative governments that succeeded the 1976‚Äì79 Labour government the proposal was not implemented. Currently, there are no proposals to electrify the line. Resignalling in the 1980s allowed faster running. This was followed by privatisation in the 1990s, being transferred first to Railtrack and then to its successor Network Rail. South West Trains Class 159 unit 159103 crossing Totnes viaduct, with a service from London Waterloo to Plymouth. South West Trains also operated to Paignton and Penzance, however, since the December 2009 timetable change, they no longer operate west of Exeter. Route =Exeter to Newton Abbot= By the sea at Coryton Cove Communities served: Exeter - Starcross (and Exmouth via a seasonal ferry service) - Dawlish Warren - Dawlish - Teignmouth - Newton Abbot On leaving the line to climbs away on the left passing the Panel Signal Box by the entrance to the Exeter TMD where local Great Western Railway DMUs are maintained. The old South Devon Railway main line, crosses the River Exe and a parallel flood relief channel, and then passes above the suburbs of Exeter along a stone viaduct on which is situated Exeter St Thomas railway station. On the left a short line went down to the Exeter Canal at City Basin; on the right a longer branch ran to Heathfield on the Newton Abbot to Moretonhampstead branch. The line crosses marshes as it runs alongside the canal and river, passing the site of Exminster railway station, with a George Hennet station house on the right. A square pond to the left of the line is the site of Turf engine house. This stretch of the line used to have long water troughs between the rails from which steam locomotives could refill their water tanks without stopping. From Powderham Castle the railway is right alongside the river; on the right of the line is the castle's deer park, while on the left, across the river, trains on the Avocet Line run near . The line now enters the village of Starcross beyond which is the pier for the Exmouth to Starcross Ferry and, on the right, the old Starcross engine house. A little further along the river the railway crosses the mouth of Cockwood harbour. Near the shipwreck here on the left was the long Exe Bight Pier, in use from 1869 for about ten years. The railway line opens out into four lines at Dawlish Warren railway station, where the platforms are alongside loop lines that allow fast trains to overtake stopping services. The railway now comes onto the South Devon Railway sea wall which it shares with a footpath. Approaching Dawlish railway station, the Coastguard's Cottage was used by the railway during its construction and then sold to the coastguard; their boat house is below the footbridge. The footpath along the sea wall now ends and the line enters its first tunnel, the Kennaway Tunnel beneath Lea Mount, beyond which is Coryton beach and then Coryton tunnel. The next beach is the private Shell Cove and then the railway passes through Phillot Tunnel and Clerk's Tunnel, emerging onto a section of sea wall at Breeches Rock before diving into Parson's Tunnel beneath Hole Head. The last two tunnels are named after the Parson and Clerk Rocks, two stacks in the sea off Hole Head. When the tunnel was dug the workers cut into a smugglers tunnel which ran from a hidden entrance above the cliff down to a secluded cove. The sea wall is known for its maintenance problems, in particular, all services on the line were suspended after the line collapsed at Dawlish during storms on 5 February 2014, but the line reopened on 4 April 2014 after extensive reconstruction work. Beyond Parson's Tunnel is a short viaduct across Smugglers Lane and then the footpath resumes alongside the line for the final stretch of the Sea Wall past Sprey Point to the cutting at Teignmouth Eastcliff. On the right side of the railway near Sprey Point can be seen the remains of a lime kiln used during the construction of the line. The railway passes through to Teignmouth railway station then continues through a cutting to emerge behind the busy Teignmouth Harbour, after which the railway resumes its course alongside the water, now the River Teign. The cuttings on both sides of the station were originally tunnels and were opened out between 1879 and 1884. The railway passes under the long Shaldon Bridge and then follows the river past the small promontories at Flow Point, Red Rock, and Summer House. After leaving the riverside the line crosses Hackney Marshes and passes between the railway sidings at Hackney Yard (left), and the race course and former Moretonhampstead branch (right). The industrial area to the left of Newton Abbot railway station is the site of the South Devon Railway Company locomotive workshops ‚Äî the older stone buildings are the only surviving railway buildings. =Newton Abbot to Plymouth= engine house at Totnes Communities served: Newton Abbot - Totnes - Ivybridge - Plymouth Just outside Newton Abbot a line branches off on the left but continues to run alongside the main line. This is the Riviera Line to and the two routes part company at Aller Junction when the main line curves to the right to start the climb up past Stoneycombe Quarry to Dainton Tunnel. The line from Exeter to Plymouth was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as an atmospheric railway which allowed steeper gradients, sharper curves, and lighter structures. Atmospheric trains never ran beyond Newton Abbot but the legacy of the aborted scheme means that line speeds on towards Plymouth are lower than elsewhere on the route. Once through Dainton Tunnel the line drops down past Littlehempston and shortly the South Devon Railway, a heritage railway, on the right. The line immediately crosses over the River Dart and arrives at , which has passing loops to allow slower trains to be overtaken. Behind the right-hand platform can be seen a dairy which is built around the old atmospheric engine house. The line then passes under the concurrent A385 and A381 roads carried on a steel girder bridge. The steep climb up Rattery Bank starts right from the end of the platform, a stiff challenge in former days to trains that called at Totnes. At the top is Rattery Viaduct and the Marley Tunnel. The original single-track tunnel had a second bore added alongside it in 1893 when the line was doubled. The line is now running along the southern edge of Dartmoor. Brent railway station was once the junction for the Kingsbridge branch line which joined the route in the cutting just before the station. Curving to the left the line passes over the Brent Mill Viaduct and then the Glazebrook Viaduct. After passing through the Wrangaton Tunnel the line passes through the remains of Wrangaton railway station; Monksmoor Siding on the right used to serve a naval stores depot. Just beyond the site of Bittaford Platform is the Bittaford Viaduct. The industrial buildings on the right were built as china clay dries where clay dug on Dartmoor was treated; the Redlake Tramway was built alongside the pipeline that carried the liquid clay. The line now comes to Ivybridge railway station. The platforms here are staggered with the one on the left nearer Totnes than the one on the right. This is a modern station opened in 1994; the original station was closed in 1965 and was on the far side of the curving Ivybridge Viaduct where an old goods shed can be seen on the left. After the Blatchford Viaduct is the old Cornwood railway station where George Hennet's station house is on the right. Slade Viaduct brings rises to the top of Hemerdon Bank, the steepest climb for trains heading towards Newton Abbot. A fast run down the bank to the site of Plympton railway station, and then Tavistock Junction. The large goods yard here includes a maintenance shed for on-track equipment and a connection to the china clay drier at Marsh Mills. This is on the former South Devon and Tavistock Railway although the junction originally faced Plymouth. The line swings left under the Marsh Mills Viaduct of the A38 road and then runs alongside the tidal estuary of the River Plym on the left, with the grounds of Saltram House at Plymstock on the far bank. Underneath the Embankment Road bridge which carries the A38 over the line again and Laira TMD on the left. Laira maintains Great Western Railway's High Speed Trains in Devon. A triangle of lines takes a freight route down to the Plymouth waterfront via the closed Plymouth Friary railway station, which was the terminus for trains on the competing route from London Waterloo station. Passing through the short Mutley Tunnel, trains emerge past the former Mutley station site and former Royal Eye Infirmary into Plymouth railway station, which was originally known as North Road Station as trains continued beyond it to . Current services Most of services on the route are operated by Great Western Railway. These services include the high speed trains from London Paddington to , Plymouth or . Some of these services travel through Reading and Bristol, and join at Taunton, before continuing to Exeter on the Bristol to Exeter line. The operator also provides local services along the full length of the line. CrossCountry Class 220 \\"Voyager\\" unit 220032 on a curve at Langstone Rock near CrossCountry services operate along the entire line. These services travel north from Plymouth through Exeter, before continuing through Taunton and to either North East England and Scotland or North West England; some continue westwards beyond Plymouth. Infrastructure The route is double track throughout with passing loops at certain locations. The highest line-speed on the route is . The route has a loading gauge clearance of W7, and is open to rolling stock up to Route Availability 8. Signalling requires four minutes between trains on most of the route, but 6 minutes west of Newton Abbot. Signalling is by multiple-aspect signals, controlled from panel signal boxes at Exeter and Plymouth. Most of the signals are three-aspect, but some sections of two- or four-aspect signalling also exist. Accidents There has been a number of serious accidents on the line over the years. Some of the notable ones are: * - collision, 22 September 1921. * Sea Wall - landslip, 16 February 1855 and various other dates including 5 February 2014. * - collision, 31 October 1853. * Totnes - boiler explosion, 13 March 1860. * Totnes ‚Äì derailment, 5 April 1865. * Rattery near Totnes - collision, 1 August 1853. * - collision, 29 July 1862. * - boiler explosion, 27 June 1849. * Plympton - collision, 13 September 1866. * - buffer stop collision, 13 September 1866.

It is situated between Kalgoorlie and Menzies along the Goldfields Highway. The town's name is Aboriginal in origin and is taken from a hill close to town. The word barduk means near or close in the local dialect. The town was gazetted on 3 June 1896.Western Australian Government Gazette, file 4204/95, 3 June 1896, p.917. Alluvial gold was first discovered in the area in 1894, and by 1895 over 400 men were working the area. Some of the mines that were operating in the area included Zoroastrian, Excelsior and Wycheproof. A telegraph line was established in 1896 and four hotels were known to be open in town. More gold deposits were found in 1896 particularly at the Mount Eva and neighbouring The Australian leases, which were described to have \\"stone hat exceeds the richness of anything stuck so far in Bardoc\\". Parcels of ore were being sent to the Mount Burgess battery for treatment. A police station was constructed by 1897, and in 1898 a coach service to Kalgoorlie was running three times a week. The population of the town was 206 (170 males and 36 females) in 1898. The area had received good rainfall and had abundant herbage on the ground in 1900. A 10-head stamp mill was being constructed at the Zoroastrian mine in the same year. A crushing plant at the Nerrin Nerrin mine, which was open for public crushing, and a 20 head mill was in action of the Excelsior lease about 5 miles north of the town. By 1908 no mines were in operation and the town was effectively deserted. A drought hit the area over 1911 causing further hindrance to mining. A petition was submitted to extend the branch pipeline from the Goldfields Water Scheme later the same year. The plan was to extend the line to Ora Banda via Bardoc and Broad Arrow. The police station was closed the same year and eventually relocated to Westonia in 1914. The area was flooded following heavy rains with the few remaining residents receiving provision from Broad Arrow and fuel being available a Vetters Station.

He, D. Cai, P. Niyogi, Tensor subspace analysis, in: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systemsc 18 (NIPS), 2005. Here are some examples of data tensors whose observations are vectorized or whose observations are matrices concatenated into data tensor images (2D/3D), video sequences (3D/4D), and hyperspectral cubes (3D/4D). The mapping from a high- dimensional vector space to a set of lower dimensional vector spaces is a multilinear projection.. When observations are retained in the same organizational structure as the sensor provides them; as matrices or higher order tensors, their representations are computed by performing N multiple linear projections. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms are higher-order generalizations of linear subspace learning methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA).  Background  With the advances in data acquisition and storage technology, big data (or massive data sets) are being generated on a daily basis in a wide range of emerging applications. Most of these big data are multidimensional. Moreover, they are usually very-high-dimensional, with a large amount of redundancy, and only occupying a part of the input space. Therefore, dimensionality reduction is frequently employed to map high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional space while retaining as much information as possible. Linear subspace learning algorithms are traditional dimensionality reduction techniques that represent input data as vectors and solve for an optimal linear mapping to a lower-dimensional space. Unfortunately, they often become inadequate when dealing with massive multidimensional data. They result in very-high-dimensional vectors, lead to the estimation of a large number of parameters.H. Lu, K. N. Plataniotis, and A. N. Venetsanopoulos, \\"MPCA: Multilinear principal component analysis of tensor objects,\\" IEEE Trans. Neural Netw., vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 18‚Äì39, January 2008.S.

TVP-based: Bayesian Multilinear Canonical Correlation Analysis (BMTF) *A TTP is a direct projection of a high- dimensional tensor to a low-dimensional tensor of the same order, using N projection matrices for an Nth-order tensor. It can be performed in N steps with each step performing a tensor-matrix multiplication (product). The N steps are exchangeable.L.D. Lathauwer, B.D. Moor, J. Vandewalle, A multilinear singular value decomposition, SIAM Journal of Matrix Analysis and Applications vol. 21, no. 4, pp. 1253‚Äì1278, 2000 This projection is an extension of the higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) to subspace learning. Hence, its origin is traced back to the Tucker decomposition in 1960s. *A TVP is a direct projection of a high-dimensional tensor to a low-dimensional vector, which is also referred to as the rank-one projections. As TVP projects a tensor to a vector, it can be viewed as multiple projections from a tensor to a scalar. Thus, the TVP of a tensor to a P-dimensional vector consists of P projections from the tensor to a scalar. The projection from a tensor to a scalar is an elementary multilinear projection (EMP). In EMP, a tensor is projected to a point through N unit projection vectors. It is the projection of a tensor on a single line (resulting a scalar), with one projection vector in each mode. Thus, the TVP of a tensor object to a vector in a P-dimensional vector space consists of P EMPs. This projection is an extension of the canonical decomposition, also known as the parallel factors (PARAFAC) decomposition.R. A. Harshman, Foundations of the PARAFAC procedure: Models and conditions for an \\"explanatory\\" multi-modal factor analysis . UCLA Working Papers in Phonetics, 16, pp. 1‚Äì84, 1970. = Typical approach in MSL = There are N sets of parameters to be solved, one in each mode. The solution to one set often depends on the other sets (except when N=1, the linear case). Therefore, the suboptimal iterative procedure inL. D. Lathauwer, B. D. Moor, J. Vandewalle, On the best rank-1 and rank-(R1, R2, ..., RN ) approximation of higher-order tensors, SIAM Journal of Matrix Analysis and Applications 21 (4) (2000) 1324‚Äì1342. is followed. #Initialization of the projections in each mode #For each mode, fixing the projection in all the other mode, and solve for the projection in the current mode. #Do the mode-wise optimization for a few iterations or until convergence. This is originated from the alternating least square method for multi-way data analysis. = Pros and cons = This figure compares the number of parameters to be estimated for the same amount of dimension reduction by vector-to-vector projection (VVP), (i.e., linear projection,) tensor-to-vector projection (TVP), and tensor-to-tensor projection (TTP). Multilinear projections require much fewer parameters and the representations obtained are more compact. (This figure is produced based on Table 3 of the survey paper) The advantages of MSL over traditional linear subspace modeling, in common domains where the representation is naturally somewhat tensorial, are: *MSL preserves the structure and correlation that the original data had before projection, by operating on a natural tensorial representation of the multidimensional data. *MSL can learn more compact representations than its linear counterpart; in other words, it needs to estimate a much smaller number of parameters. Thus, MSL can handle big tensor data more efficiently, by performing computations on a representation with many fewer dimensions. This leads to lower demand on computational resources. However, MSL algorithms are iterative and are not guaranteed to converge; where an MSL algorithm does converge, it may do so at a local optimum. (In contrast, traditional linear subspace modeling techniques often produce an exact closed-form solution.) MSL convergence problems can often be mitigated by choosing an appropriate subspace dimensionality, and by appropriate strategies for initialization, for termination, and for choosing the order in which projections are solved.

The earliest occupation of the site dates to the Ubaid period (ca. 5200‚Äì4900 BC), and was excavated by a Danish team from 1990‚Äì1995 in four seasons. Overview The tell, now flooded by the al-Hassakah Dam project, was around in area. The western side of the tell formed a high mound, rising to a height of more than . The lower and flatter eastern side rose above plain level. The mudbrick houses, found at the earliest level of the tell, had small rooms with fireplaces, grinding stones, mortars and painted pots. The later levels show a shift in occupation to other parts of the tell, where areas inhabited earlier were turned into a refuse midden and later a cemetery. The site was later abandoned for hundreds of years only to be rebuilt again in the fourth millennium BC. This level had a large tripartite building measuring about 11.5 by 10.5 m. =Boat models= One of the most remarkable finds at the Ubaid level of the site were fragments of two pottery boat models, excavated in 1991. The models represented long, narrow canoes with pointed sterns. The boats were probably made of reed coated with bitumen to make them waterproof. The findings strongly suggest that people of the Khabur region had already made use of boats for transport and fishing by c. 5000 BC, if not before. Similar models have been unearthed from other Ubaid sites such as Eridu, Ubaid, Uqair and Abada.

It was one of the principal routes of the pre-1948 Great Western Railway which were subsequently taken over by the Western Region of British Railways and are now part of the Network Rail system. History The line was built by the Bristol and Exeter Railway with Isambard Kingdom Brunel as the engineer. The section from Bristol to Bridgwater was opened on 14 June 1841 and it was completed to Taunton on 1 July 1842. It was initially operated by the Great Western Railway (GWR) as an extension of their line from London Paddington and formed part of the broad gauge trunk route to Penzance on which through trains were run from 1867, but in the same year the section between Highbridge and Durston was reconstructed as a mixed gauge line to accommodate local gauge traffic. The remainder of the line was laid with mixed gauge by 1 June 1875 and broad gauge trains ceased operation on 20 May 1892. The Bristol and Exeter Railway took over its own operations from 1 May 1849 but amalgamated with the GWR on 1 January 1876. On 1 July 1906 the Langport and Castle Cary Railway line was opened which enabled London to Taunton trains to run on a shorter route instead of the \\"Great Way Round\\" through Bristol. The Great Western Railway was nationalised on 1 January 1948 into the Western Region of British Railways. In 1977 the Parliamentary Select Committee on Nationalised Industries recommended considering electrification of more of Britain's rail network, and by 1979 BR presented a range of options to do so by 2000. Some included electrifying the Bristol to Exeter line, Exeter to Plymouth Line, Riviera Line and Cornish Main Line. Under the 1979‚Äì90 Conservative governments that succeeded the 1976‚Äì79 Labour government the proposal was not implemented. At present, there are no plans to electrify the line or any other lines mentioned, although locals are campaigning for electrification of the line from Bristol to Weston-Super-Mare. The Bristol to Taunton Line is now part of Route 13 of the Network Rail system. Route =Bristol to Taunton= The Bristol to Taunton section is a main line linking the Great Western Main Line at to the Reading to Taunton Line at , Somerset. Passenger services are operated by Great Western Railway and CrossCountry. Bristol to Weston-super-Mare Communities served: Bristol (including the suburb of Bedminster) - Nailsea - Backwell - Yatton - Weston-super-Mare (including the suburb of Worle) On leaving Bristol Temple Meads the line passes through suburban and railway stations. This section of the route has three tracks and, as far as Bedminster, the centre track is reversible to give some flexibility for regulating trains in the Temple Meads area. After passing through a short, deep cutting at Parson Street, the Portbury branch line diverges on the right. The line climbs westwards up past Long Ashton village and under the A370 road to enter a cutting with Flax Bourton tunnel at the summit. The remains of Flax Bourton railway station are near the tunnel. The line descends to Nailsea and Backwell railway station, which is on a road bridge between Backwell on the left and Nailsea over the low hill on the right. It then continues past the isolated church at Chelvey (left) to Yatton railway station. This was once a busy junction station with branches to Clevedon (right) and Wells (left); the latter is now a footpath and cycleway as far as Cheddar. Beyond Yatton the line runs across the low- lying North Marsh with level crossings at Hewish and , where an old signal box is retained to supervise the two level crossings. The line passes beneath the M5 motorway approaching Puxton and then comes to Worle railway station on the outskirts of Weston-super-Mare. A short distance beyond the station is Worle Junction where a single-track branch diverges to the right to serve and railway stations. There is a crossing loop at Weston-super-Mare, beyond which the single track continues to rejoin the main line at Uphill Junction. Weston-super-Mare to Taunton ;Communities served: Weston-super-Mare - Highbridge - Burnham-on-Sea - Bridgwater - Taunton The line has now swung round to head south. At Uphill there is a short, deep cutting crossed by a high brick bridge built by Brunel, known locally as \\"Devil's Bridge\\". Beyond this lie the remains of Bleadon and Uphill railway station (right). Passing across the Somerset Levels the line comes to the site of Brent Knoll railway station with the isolated hill that it was named for close by on the left. The next open station is ; this is in Highbridge but also serves co-joined Burnham-on-Sea. The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway used to cross the line on the level just north of the station; their locomotive works were on the site of the industrial units visible to the left as the line passes through the station. More level ground brings the line to with the only operational goods yard on the whole line, which is mainly used for waste traffic from Hinkley Point B Nuclear Power Station. Beyond the station, on the right, used to be the carriage works of the Bristol and Exeter Railway but the site is now lost beneath modern industrial units. The line now crosses over the River Parrett on the Somerset Bridge and then passes below the M5 again. The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal now joins on the right for most of the way to . At the former Yeovil branch line joins from the left. A short cutting brings the line to Cogload Junction; the line towards Taunton climbs up here and crosses above the Reading to Taunton Line which it then joins to complete the journey to Taunton, passing and the former junction of the Chard branch line on the left. The final run into Taunton sees the River Tone appear alongside on left and the canal passes beneath line to join the river at Firepool, behind the site of the former goods yard on the same side. =Taunton to Exeter= ;Communities served:Taunton - Tiverton and Willand - Exeter The line leaves Taunton with the abandoned engine shed on the left, and passes the engineer's depot at Fairwater Yard on the same side. The former Norton Fitzwarren railway station is the location of two serious collisions and a fatal train fire. The West Somerset Railway diverges on the right and work is under way to provide new facilities here for this heritage railway which includes relaying track for a short distance along the old Devon and Somerset Railway that formed a third route in between the main line and the West Somerset. On the left of the line an embankment marks the remains of the Grand Western Canal. After passing over Victory Crossing at Bradford-on-Tone, the line starts to climb upwards. It passes through the remains of Wellington station and then under the A38 road at , which was the site of the line's terminus while work was underway to excavate the Whiteball Tunnel at the top of Wellington Bank. It was coming down here that City of Truro became the first locomotive to exceed . Through the tunnel and into Devon, the M5 motorway comes alongside on the left and the line arrives at , the railhead for much of north Devon via the A361 road that joins the motorway next to the station. A short distance further is Tiverton Loops, the site of the former Tiverton Junction railway station. The motorway service station on the left marks the site of Cullompton railway station, and then the line passes the remains of and stations. At the old Exe Valley Railway used to join from the right, and then the railway sweeps through the valley of the River Culm to where it joins the River Exe near Cowley Bridge Junction. Here the Tarka Line from Barnstaple joins on the right and the line then passes (on the same side) Riverside Yard and an old transhipment shed. Until 20 May 1892, when the then GWR lines were converted from the broad gauge, the shed was used to transfer goods between broad gauge wagons and the standard gauge wagons used by the London and South Western Railway to Yeovil and Barnstaple. Passing over the wide Red Cow level crossing, the line comes to Exeter St Davids railway station. Services A approaching Most services on the route are operated by Great Western Railway. Local trains generally operate from to (calling at all stations except and ) and from to , combining to give a half-hourly service between Weston-super-Mare and Bristol Temple Meads throughout much of the day. A number of other through trains are also operated, mainly to and from ; a few services continue towards . Local trains are mostly formed from a mix of and DMUs. London services are operated using Class 800 and Class 802 sets. The other operator on the route is CrossCountry, which provides trains between Scotland and north-east England and , or . Trains are mostly formed of and units, working either singly or in pairs, although each day also sees a few workings using HST sets. Heritage trains often operate on the route on rail tours and summer weekends for several years have featured regular steam-hauled Torbay Express services. Infrastructure The route has a line speed limit of with local variations, the main one being the 110 mph from approx. Bleadon (138-44) to Huntspill (147-00); trains from Bristol to Taunton are described as travelling in the 'down' direction. It is constructed to Route Availability 8 and freight loading gauge W8. It has Multiple Aspect Signals (MAS) and Track Circuit Block (TCB) controlled from the panel signal box at Bristol. A local signal box at controls the two level crossings at Hewish and Puxton, and an emergency panel at can take control of the section from Hewish to Uphill Junction if required. With the coming upgrade to the Great Western Main Line, the main line from London to Bristol is due to be electrified. However, the electrification will not extend beyond Bristol to , so the line will continue to be served by diesel trains. This could entail the removal of direct London services, as electric trains would not be able to operate beyond Bristol. however the new trains are a hybrid of diesel and electric power therefore can run on non electrified routes so this is no longer a problem. The group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supports the electrification continuing to Weston, as does MP for Weston-super-Mare John Penrose. The / corridor is one of the main axes of the proposed Greater Bristol Metro, which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area. There have also been calls for a dedicated railway line to Bristol Airport, branching off from the main line somewhere near Flax Bourton.

At the time, two uranium mines were operating, both in the Northern Territory, Ranger and Nabarlek. However, this new policy left a loophole, as it permitted uranium to be mined as a by-product of other mining operations. The later exception allowed for development of the Olympic Dam mine, located in South Australia, as it also contained gold and copper. The following year, 1983, Labor won the federal elections and came into power for the first time since 1975. The three-mine policy was officially introduced in 1984, after the federal elections that year had confirmed Bob Hawke of the Labor Party as Prime Minister of Australia. The policy restricted uranium mining in Australia to three existing mines, Ranger, Nabarlek and Olympic Dam. The policy was abandoned in 1996, after the 1996 federal election replaced the Labor Party with John Howard's Coalition in power.Beyond the Three Mines - In Situ Uranium Leaching Proposals in South Australia Parliament of Australia ‚Äì Parliament Library: Research Paper 12 1997-98, published: 12 May 1998, accessed: 18 February 2011 The new policy was to develop the country's uranium mining industry and uranium exports. The Australian Labor Party changed back its policy in the 1990s to a \\"no new mines\\" policy to allow uranium mines already approved by the Coalition government to go ahead.Beazley's mines gamble The Age, published: 25 July 2006, accessed: 18 February 2011 With the opening of a fourth uranium mine in Australia in 2001, the Beverley uranium mine, and the approval of a fifth mine, the Honeymoon uranium mine, Labor's stand had essentially become a \\"five-mine policy\\", as Nabarlek had since been closed. The Labor Party, however, continued its opposition to increased uranium mining until 2006, when, under the leadership of Kim Beazley, discussions to abandon the \\"no new mines\\" policy were initiated.Beazley flags 'three mine' policy debate Australian Broadcasting Corporation, published: 29 March 2006, accessed: 18 February 2011 In April 2007, the Labor party, under the new leadership of Kevin Rudd voted at their national conference to abandon the policy. The vote was only won by a narrow margin- 205 to 190, and heavy internal criticism resulted.Labor abandons \\"three mine policy perthnow.com.au, published: 27 April 2007, accessed: 18 February 2011 Ministers Peter Garrett and Anthony Albanese remained outspokenly opposed to the decision due to the unresolved problems of nuclear waste storage and nuclear weapons proliferation. Premier Mike Rann  South Australia  South Australia's Premier Mike Rann and treasurer Kevin Foley had lobbied the Federal government to abandon the policy, and Rann reflected on this during his opening address at the 2010 AusIMM International Uranium Conference. Of the Rann Government's role, he said: > \\"Our support for the exploration and mining of uranium can also be seen in > the role we played in having the ALP overturn its \\"no new uranium mines\\" > policy in 2007. I have to say, it was one of the more difficult tasks that > I've been given over the years, but I personally campaigned strongly for > that out-dated and illogical policy to be discarded and it has been. It's > gone now, for all time.\\" South Australian Liberal party Senator Nick Minchin supported the lobbying efforts of the Rann government, saying: > \\"We of course welcome Mr Rann's advocacy of getting rid of one of the most > stupid policies the federal Labor Party has ever had.\\" At a working dinner of the South Australian Minerals & Petroleum Expert Group (SAMPEG), the opening address by the Minister for Mineral Resources Development Paul Holloway responded to the result of the vote. It was recorded in the meeting's minutes thus: > \\"The narrow vote in the recent scrapping of the no new mines policy made > apparent the amount of ignorance there is present regarding uranium. It will > now be a challenge for the SAMPEG group to address the lack of knowledge in > both the public and government... SAMPEG can now make sure the world is > aware that South Australia is open for business in regards to uranium.\\" At the same meeting, the SAMPEG Chair Dr Ian Gould spoke on uranium. The minutes reflect: > \\"SAMPEG should consider that the public doesn't understand the industry and > members could directly contribute to the continued enhancement of resources > information in this state. Information has never been presented in > relatively simple terms to the public. A lot of people at a Ministerial > level still don't understand uranium.

Then he would give a sort of sermon in the Huthaus, the administrative building, which was decorated for the occasion. Singing miners' songs such as Der Steiger, the miners would give thanks to God for the products of the mine. A simple, traditional meal ended the shift. The meal usually consisted of bratwurst with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut as well as herbed schnapps and a cigar (gaahlem Gelecht). Also common are gl√ºhwein, tea and bacon-fat butterbrot. The idea of the Mettenschicht has spread from the Ore Mountains to many exhibition mines as an idea for a Christmas celebration with elements of mining tradition. They vary from end-of-year celebrations focusing on strict historical authenticity, often held in the mine itself, attended by sponsors, friends, and in many cases honorary officials of the mine, through incentive events for which tickets are sold, to mining folk events put on in the city hall for bus tours.

SSI SCHAEFER - Fritz Schaefer GmbH  Headquarter of SSI Schaefer In 1937, Fritz Schaefer started a small company in his garage and produced a selection of sheet metal products. After switching to the serial production of transport boxes and containers, the company was able to expand its business and had to set up a larger facility in Neunkirchen-Salchendorf in 1948. With the death of Fritz Schaefer, his four sons - Hans, Gerhard, Manfred and Theo - took over. After producing boxes for bottled milk for a while, the company then developed fixed storage boxes in 1953, which were originally made from sheet metal, but are now also available in a plastic version. This marked the beginning of the company's rapid ascent. The production of shelves started in 1958. In 2000 the company bought SSI Schaefer Noell GmbH (Giebelstadt), a supplier of solutions for intralogistics. SSI Schaefer Peem GmbH (Graz, Austria), a provider of order picking technology, was acquired in 2001. Finally, SSI Schaefer took over Salomon Automation GmbH (Friesach near Graz) in 2008, to add logistics software to the portfolio. = Products = The range of products of SSI Schaefer GmbH can be divided into 5 groups: * Logistics software: software to control and monitor warehouse operations * Storage and conveyor technology: High rise racking; platforms; storage and retrieval devices, boxes and containers * Workstation systems: office-, workshop and business equipment * Logistics systems: automated storage, conveying and picking systems * Waste management: waste containers; waste disposal solutions  Schaefer Werke GmbH  When the mine \\"Pfannenberger Einigkeit\\" was closed down in April 1962, the premises were sold to Theo and Manfred Schaefer, sons of the entrepreneur Fritz Schaefer. They established the Pfannenberg GmbH, which started producing workbenches. Soon thereafter, the company was renamed Sch√§fer Werke KG and began manufacturing radiators and boilers. In the early 1970s, a new facility was set up in Betzdorf called ‚ÄûSchaefer Ausstattungssysteme‚Äú (Schaefer equipment systems). Here, the company developed and produced cabinets, workbenches and other workplace equipment. Today, this also includes IT-system equipment such as server cabinets and network racks. In addition to heating technology, a polyurethane-covered keg was developed in the following of a crisis in 1978. Perforated plates further broadened the range of products. The sales of heating products spiked in 1994, since they were in high demand in Eastern Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Another facility was established in Ledec nad S√°zavou in the Czech Republic in 1995. Since then, Schaefer Sudex is producing containers for beverages and chemicals there. The company set up a fourth facility in Dresden in 1995, and rebuilt it in 2002. Finally, in 2005 the company decided to sell the entire heating division to the Turkish company Demir D√∂k√ºm.

Early life He is now thought to have been born in the years 1633 to 1636 at Todenham in Gloucestershire, the son of George Dwight, a farmer, and his wife, Joane Greenough. The family then, shortly afterwards, moved to North Hinksey. He studied at Oxford University, and worked as an assistant to Robert Boyle in the later 1650s. In 1661 Dwight was appointed registrar and scribe to the diocese of Chester, and the same year he proceeded to the degree of B.C.L. at Christ Church, Oxford. He lived at Chester for some time, where he acted as secretary to successive bishops. At the end of the 1660s he fell out with John Wilkins, and turned to a new career. Potter Dwight was living in Wigan at the end of the 1660s, when he sold his church posts, and invested in a career as a potter. He moved to London, where he was supported by Boyle and Robert Hooke. In 1672 he was granted a patent of 14 years for \\"the mistery of transparent earthenware, commonly known by the names of porcelain or china, and of stoneware, vulgarly called Cologne ware\\". He then established the Fulham Pottery. The staple output was brown stoneware. Ambitious to replace all imported ceramics by his own products, Dwight experimented on a large scale. He also took out a second patent, and attempted to enforce it with extensive litigation: the targets of his legal action included John Philip Elers and the Wedgwood brothers of Burslem. Death Dwight died in 1703, and his business was carried on by his descendants for some time, but with gradually diminishing success. Works He is the earliest clearly documented maker of stoneware in England,Bergesen, 71; MoL although immigrant Dutch or German potters were probably doing so several decades before. From the earliest days, Fulham was a significant manufacturer of salt-glazed stoneware, initially brown, but later white as well.Bergesen, 71 But Dwight was a very early experimenter with porcelain, approaching the matter scientifically, keeping records of his trials. Excavations in the 1970s uncovered many of his coded test pieces, which the Museum of London feels able to call \\"porcelain\\", although such wares never seem to have been produced for sale.MoL The British Museum contains a number of the best of Dwight‚Äôs pieces, of including a bust of Prince Rupert. Other specimens are in the Victoria and Albert Museum. On 3 March 1674 Dwight's six- year-old daughter Lydia died. In her memory he produced two ceramic sculptures, which are among the oldest examples of this type in Europe. In one she is standing in her burial clothes with a skull at her foot. Lydia Dwight Resurrected, V&A; Museum Another half-length figure shows the girl dead in her bed, holding a posy of flowers.Lydia Dwight Dead, V&A; Museum These was private images for the family of the dead girl. In the same year he exhibited similar sculptures to the Royal Society, indicating that he was developing his method of manufacturing salt-glazed stoneware in order to enable it to be used for this purpose. Statues and figures are mentioned in his revised patent of 1684, although he does not seem to have produced any after this date, almost all the known examples having been made in the 1670s. The names of the modellers of the sculptures are not known. Most of the small number of examples in the London museums were made as one-off hand-modelled pieces, rather than using moulds to allow repetition, and seem to have come from a sale after Dwight's last descendant died in 1859.\\"Neptune\\" and \\"Bust\\" (of Dwight), both V&A; Museum Notes ReferencesElliott, Gordon, \\"The Elers in Staffordshire\\", in Aspects of Ceramic History: A Series of Papers Focusing on the Ceramic Artifact As Evidence of Cultural and Technical Developments, 2006, Gordon Elliott, , 9780955769009, online *Bergesen, Victoria, Bergesen's Price Guide: British Ceramics, 1992, Barrie & Jenkins, *\\"MoL\\" \\"Porcelain test piece\\", Museum of London Sources 1703 deaths English potters Alumni of the University of Oxford Year of birth unknown ","title":"John Dwight (potter)"},{"id":"30910226","text":"Emil Kriewitz (1822‚Äì1902) was a German immigrant and veteran of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, who came to this country with the Adelsverein colonists. After John O. Meusebach successfully negotiated the Meusebach‚ÄìComanche Treaty, Kriewitz lived among the Penateka Comanche as an intermediary between the whites and Penateka. In 1993, his home in Castell, Texas, was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark, Marker number 9444. Early life Emil von Kriewitz de Czepry was born on January 18, 1822, near Potsdam, Germany. Texas Kriewitz emigrated to Texas as part of the Adelsverein colonization program. He left Bremen, Germany, on October 28, 1845 aboard the Franziska, and disembarked at Galveston, Texas on January 11, 1846. From there, Kriewitz accompanied other Adelsverein colonists to Indianola, which Adelsverein Commissioner-General Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels had renamed Carlshafen in honor of himself, Count Carl of Castell-Castell and Count Victor August of Leiningen-Westerburg-Alt-Leiningen whom Solms claimed had been christened Carl. Prince Solms' choice of Carlshafen and its inadequate accommodations as a port of entry, as well as the isolated route to New Braunfels, was to keep the Germans from interacting with any Americans.King (1967) pp.52‚Äì58 John O. Meusebach, as successor to Prince Solms, had arranged with the Torrey brothers for transporting the colonists inland, but the United States hired the Torrey brothers for use in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War to serve Zachary Taylor's army in Corpus Christi.King (1967) pp.85,87 An epidemic of spinal meningitis broke out at Carlshafen and spread with the emigrants to New Braunfels and Fredericksburg.King (1967) p.88 Fellow German colonist and veteran of the French Foreign Legion Augustus Buchel formed the First Regiment of Texas Foot Rifles, serving as its captain. Kriewitz was a co-founding member of the company of 80 volunteers. On May 22, 1846, the company was drafted into the service of Col. Albert Sidney Johnston as Company H, First Texas Rifle Volunteers. The unit saw service at Matamoros, Tamaulipas and Camargo. A combination of bad climate and bad living conditions decimated the unit, and most of the members were discharged. Life with the Comanches May 9, 1847, the vested party representatives of the Penateka Comanche and German colonists met in Fredericksburg to ratify and sign the \\"Treaty Between the Comanche and the German Immigration Company\\". In accordance with the terms of the treaty, Meusebach paid the Penateka Comanches $3,000, slightly less than $70,000 in today's money, in food, gifts and other commodities for their participation in the signing of the agreement.King (1967) Un-numbered plateMeredith, Howard L. A Short History of the Native Americans in the United States. Malabar, FL: Krieger Publishing Company, 2001: 31. The Penateka also requested that a representative of the German colonists serve as an in-house intermediary and live among them. Kriewitz was assigned to be the intermediary, and went to live at the camp of war chief Santa Anna. In the camp, Kriewitz began to assimilate into the culture to gain the confidence and friendship of Santa Anna, who otherwise was not totally trustful of the white settlers. Santa Anna's group traveled to New Braunfels in August 1847 to meet with Meusebach and his successor Hermann Spiess. Because of his assimilated appearance, the German parties did not recognize Kriewitz, whom Santa Anna had forbidden to speak during the meeting. Kriewitz communicated with the German parties by tapping one beneath the negotiating table, which prompted the German to pass a pencil and paper to Kriewitz under the table. Kriewitz was able to slip out to visit friends, but Santa Anna became distrusting thereafter. Afterward, Kriewitz requested, and received, permission from Santa Anna to visit his old friend Wilhelm Victor Keidel, who had served with him in the Mexican War. Kriewitz, however, never returned to the Penateka camp after that. Settlements Adelsverein Vice President and Executive Secretary-Business Director Count Carl Frederick Christian of Castell-Castell, made a deal with the socialistic organization Darmstadt Society of Forty to colonize 200 families on the Fisher‚ÄìMiller Land Grant territory in Texas. In return, they were to receive $12,000 in money, livestock, equipment, and provisions for a year. After the first year, the colonies were expected to support themselves.King (1967) p.122 Beginning in 1847, Kriewitz was assigned with building a road into the territory and to serve as guide for the Society of Forty immigrants into the territory to begin their settlements. The society began Castell, Leiningen, Bettina, Schoenburg, and Meerholz in Llano County; Darmst√§dler Farm in Comal County; and Tusculum in Kendall County. Of these, only Castell survives. Post Comanche life On December 15, 1847, Kriewitz was one of the petitioners requesting the creation of Gillespie County. In 1852, Kriewitz settled in Castell and went into retail partnership with Franz Kettner. In 1870, Kriewitz was elected justice of the peace for Precinct Four of Llano County. In 1871, he served as a county election judge. On December 27, 1876, Kriewitz was appointed postmaster in Castell, serving until the appointment of Ed Buckholtz in 1883. Kriewitz spent the rest of his life as a rancher and land speculator. Personal life and death In 1857, Kriewitz married Amelia Markwordt at Cherry Springs. The couple had eight children. Emil Kriewitz died on May 21, 1902, in Castell, and is buried in the Llano City Cemetery.

Environment This type of riparian vegetation and its accompanying ecosystem is found in the Western Cape, South Africa, on freshwater floodplains, along the lower stretches of rivers and around seasonal vleis and estuaries. The terrain is typically flat and the soil is rich and silty. It is restricted to a winter rainfall area. This used to be one of the major ecosystems on the Cape Flats of Cape Town. The Cape Flats used to have a great many wetlands, rivers and seasonal vleis, but these have largely been drained and built over for housing. A few remain at places such as Rondevlei. Ecology The flora consists of a range of species of tall reed (e.g. Phragmites australis, Typha capensis), Restios, sedges, grasses, floating aquatics and a great many species of shrub. Plant cover is very high. Sedgelands predominate on the floodplains, floating aquatics grow in the open pools, taller shrubs and small trees grow in drier soils (e.g. Erica and Restio sp.) and the taller, bigger reed-beds dominate on the fringes of permanent water. Some of the most noticeable and dominant species are Senecio halimnifolius, Paspalum vaginatum, Pennisetum macrourum, Triglochin bulbosa, Bolboschoenus maritimus and Juncus krausii. Plant species which are endemic to this vegetation type include: Passerina paludosa, Aponogeton angustifolius, Aponogeton distachyos, and Cotula myriophylloides. This ecosystem is not particularly rich in endemics (by Cape Floristic Region standards) but is an exceptionally rich and important habitat for the Waterbirds and Frogs of the Cape. It is also the breeding ground of the endangered Western Leopard Toad. Threats and Conservation These ecosystems are threatened by invasive alien plants such as Kikuyu grass, Water Hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes), Red River Gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) and Port Jackson (Acacia saligna), as well as the draining and diversion of water for agricultural reasons and development. A significant proportion of these wetlands have now been transformed and lost and the ecosystem as a whole is now classed as endangered. All remaining wetlands are protected by national legislation.

Since its construction in 1835, the Classical-style building has been used by four different Nonconformist Christian denominations: the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, Wesleyan Methodists, the Salvation Army and Plymouth Brethren. The Brethren occupied it last and for the longest time. After about 150 years of religious use, it was sold for residential conversion. English Heritage has listed the former chapel at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History Steyning was founded early in the Saxon era, and was already an important trading settlement when St Cuthman founded St Andrew's Church in the 8th century. He was later buried there, as was King √Üthelwulf of Wessex, increasing the village's significance. Throughout its early history, Steyning was one of Sussex's main settlements, but its importance declined from the 16th century. Residential growth resumed in the 19th century, though. Sussex was a hotbed of Protestant Nonconformity in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Puritans were active in Steyning from 1587 or earlier. Quaker and Baptist communities became established: a 17th-century timber-framed house now called Penn's House (after William Penn, who lived nearby and was associated with it) was used by Quakers as a meeting house, and a short-lived Baptist chapel existed on Steyning High Street. In 1835, Rev. Edward Lambert, described as a \\"Dissenting minister\\" from Brighton, visited Steyning and founded another chapel. It was originally associated with the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, a small Calvinistic Methodist denomination found mostly in Sussex, but the cause was unsuccessful. Rev. Lambert returned to Brighton, where he was later associated with Zion Chapel in the town's Bedford Street. Jarvis Lane, on which the originally unnamed chapel stood, was named after its most prominent building‚ÄîJarvis House, a 15th-century timber-framed farmhouse. The land around it was part of a tenement called Gervases in 1403, and the name originated with the family of Robert Gervays, recorded in 1255. Meanwhile, Wesleyan Methodism was growing in strength in Sussex. In 1807, the Lewes and Brighton Wesleyan Circuit was formed; it covered a wide geographic area and controlled ten chapels by 1841. In that year, the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion congregation stopped meeting at the Jarvis Lane chapel and it was sold to a local butcher. According to deeds and newspaper reports, a Wesleyan congregation was formed in Steyning in about September 1841 and acquired the chapel in 1843. The Methodist trustees paid ¬£350 for the building, and its conveyance was legalised on 13 October 1843. The chapel became part of the Lewes and Brighton Circuit by March 1844. By 1855, when a local guide noted that \\"the Wesleyans have a neat chapel at Steyning\\", the place of worship had a name: Trinity Chapel. Its membership was 33 in 1844, but this declined over the next decades: in 1850 the chapel had 17 members, and there were 10 in 1865. Nevertheless, attendances at services held up‚Äîespecially in the evenings, when Anglicans from St Andrew's Church are believed to have contributed to the typical figure of 150 worshippers. The chapel's Sunday school was also very successful: 64 children attended in 1876, despite the building's shortcomings (it had a large, tall single space which could not be partitioned). Around this time, the name Rose Villa Chapel also existed. The Methodist community moved into the new Steyning Methodist Church, partly funded by the sale of Jarvis Hall, in 1878. The trustees debated extending the premises, but in June 1874 it was resolved to take no action. Later that year, Henry Northcroft‚Äîa leading figure in Methodism in nearby Lancing (to whose chapel he had given money in 1872) and Worthing‚Äîgave some land on Steyning High Street to the Methodist cause. In 1875, the trustees successfully sought permission from the Methodist Conference to sell Jarvis Hall and establish a new larger chapel. At an auction on 27 May 1878, the chapel, its land and all fixtures and fittings were sold to a local builder, William Watson, for ¬£235. After expenses, the trustees had ¬£223.16s.8d. in the building fund for their new chapel, which had begun in the meantime. The new Steyning Methodist Church, in flint and yellow brick, opened on 13 April 1878. William Watson sold the building on to the firm of Kilner & Burgess, who used it as a mineral water processing and bottling factory. It re-entered religious use in about 1883 when the Salvation Army started meeting there for worship. Meanwhile, from as early as 1875, and certainly by 1884, a congregation of Plymouth Brethren became established in Steyning; they met in a barn on the farmland belonging to Jarvis House. They moved into the chapel in 1907, and it became known as the Christian Meeting Hall. The congregation shared the building with a school gym at first, and a theatre and dance school occupied the building for a time during the 1960s. An independent Christian fellowship also shared the chapel from 1970. Brethren worship continued in the chapel for nearly a century, but in 1987 planning permission was granted to convert the building into flats. Jarvis Hall was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 9 May 1980, when it was still a Brethren meeting hall. This status defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 1,628 Grade II listed buildings, and 1,726 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Horsham. Architecture Jarvis Hall is a plain Neoclassical building with a single storey. The walls are stuccoed. The fa√ßade has four tall pilasters reaching from ground level to a cornice, above which is a giant pediment with a circular recess which had a clock-face during the chapel's years of Methodist ownership. There are two tall arched windows flanking a double doorway with panelled doors. This has a straight-headed fanlight and sits below a cornice.

It is operated by the Thiruvananthapuram division of the Southern Railway zone of the Indian Railways. Etymology Vanchinad was one of the names of the old princely state of Travancore, which actually had the shape of a ship. The train runs along most of what was once Travancore, and hence the train has been given this name. History and relevance The train was introduced in 1985 between Thiruvananthapuram Central and Ernakulam Junction. During initial period the train had only 2 stops at Kottayam and Kollam railway stations and was one of the fastest trains running in Kerala. At that time Vanchinad Express started from Ernakulam Jn at 0600 and arrived Trivandrum Central at 0950 am. On the return run, it started at 1710 from Trivandrum Central and arrived Ernakulam Junction at 2100. The train was given a lot of additional stoppages starting in the mid 1990s due to political pressure from MLAs and MPs which resulted in increased running time of the train and revised schedule. Today, Vanchinad Express has 17 stops between Trivandrum Central and Ernakulam Junction. Coach composition When the train was introduced in 1985 the train had one first class compartment and the rest were second class compartments. Later an additional first class coach was added. Today the first class coaches have been removed and replaced with one AC chair car. Pantry car facility was also available in earlier times which was also withdrawn later. Today the train has 19 or 20 coaches depending on the availability of coaches with one reserved AC chair car and one reserved Second Sitting coach, for which tickets can be reserved in advance. Other second sitting coaches can be boarded with unreserved tickets issued from the counter.

(pg. 69, 196) Stivers and the other Little Big Horn water carriers faced great danger, especially with Sioux braves hidden in bushes along the river, and at least one of the soldiers was wounded in an ambush. He and the rest of the water carriers were cited for gallantry, along with five others for direct combat actions, and awarded the Medal of Honor two years after the battle though Stivers received his posthumously. Stivers was discharged on August 5, 1876, while encamped with his unit at the mouth of Rosebud Creek in the Montana Territory, and returned to Kentucky where he attempted to go into business for himself. He died less than a year later, murdered over a business dispute, in Kingston on June 28, 1877, at age 27. Stivers was buried in the city cemetery of nearby Richmond, Kentucky. Stivers was one of three Kentuckians, along with Privates William M. Harris and George D. Scott, who were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle, and as such, they have received special honors by their home state. Their role at the Little Big Horn is mentioned on a marker at the Richmond Cemetery where Stivers and Harris (both Marion County natives) are buried, though the location of Scott's gravesite is unknown. Kentucky Highway 1295, a state highway which runs through Kirksville to Garrard County, was later designated as the Harris-Scott-Stivers Memorial Highway. On June 26, 1999, a special commemoration ceremony to honor Kentucky's Medal of Honor winners was held for Stivers, Harris and Scott, at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond;Johnson, Harry C.

Mosimann had come to Furrer's attention when he won a Gold Medal for his cooking, at a competition in Lucerne. When the Dorchester's restaurant achieved a two star rating in the Michelin Guide it was the first hotel restaurant outside France to do so. Cuisine naturelle Mosimann has said \\"I created what I call cuisine naturelle. Its main characteristic is that it does without such ingredients as butter, cream, and alcohol. The focus is concentrated even more on the flavour of the individual ingredients. The dishes are only lightly cooked. In nouvelle cuisine and also cuisine naturelle, enormous emphasis is put on the presentation of the dishes.\\" His book, Cuisine Naturelle, was published in 1985. Later career After leaving the Dorchester Mosimann opened a private dining club in a converted Scottish Presbyterian church in Belgravia in 1988.

History  Wealthy landowners, woods and fabrics and wool merchants were settled outside the city in the Valley district, facing the path of Pavia, at the foot of the terrace of the Ticino river, parallel to the coast of the municipality.Ardizzi's family. Unfortunately still unknown how and why the surname originated compound Pozzo Ardizzi, the more relevant hypothesis is that this change was due to reasons of nobility (for example, political situations or union between families) . Its first member was Antonio Pozzo Ardizzi, a descendant of Francesco Ardizzi (d. Vigevano in the year 1399). Antonio, along with his son Cardinal Abramo Ardizzi (also referred to as the Abraam Pozo-Ardicio), bishop of Senigallia, founded in Vigevano, among 1421 and 1424, a church in San Martino valuation under the title Assunzione Beatissima della Vergine Maria, e di S. Jeronimo Dottor della Santa Chiesa, e di S. Maria Maddalena. For this action, obtained from Pope Eugene IV plenary indulgence of three years imprisonment and a period of quarantine for the feast of \\"Madonna della Assunzione\\" and the feast of \\"Santo Ieronimo\\": Traditiio possessionis ac litentia concessa etc. On the altar wall of the chapel, on the right hand, it could read the inscription: D.

Abramo Ardizzi played an important role as a diplomat in the peace achieved on June 6, 1449 between Vigevano and Count Francesco Sforza. Following the agreement, Vigevano accepted Francesco Sforza as Lord prompting the entry of an armed contingent, the cancellation of the right to loot and put the city under the protection of The Duchess Bianca Maria Visconti (wife and daughter of the Duke Francesco Filippo Maria Visconti, ruler of Milan). Abramo was governor of Alessandria, ambassador of the Duke Filippo before the king of France, Carlos VII and King Naples Renato, Duke of Anjou (Anji), Count of Provence. In 1455 he was mayor of Vigevano. He obtained from Filippo the castle and the land of Colonnella in Abruzzo, with the title of Count, in return for services in the embassies.[Miscellanea di storia italiana, (1892). volumen 29.

His contribution to the genre was with the creation of various works and in the direction of radio companies. He also wrote in the newspaper La Raz√≥n, La Prensa, the editorial Atlantida and the Caras y Caretas magazine. Published humorous stories, novels and poetry.Luis Hip√≥lito Antonio Pozzo Ardizzi - Bibliographic notice. La Pichona Cart \\"La Pichona\\" A son of Cesare F. Antonio Pozzo Ardizzi, C√©sar Juan Bautista, bought in 1909 in the city of Tandil, at 17 years of age, a cart called \\"La Pichona\\". The vehicle was about 6 meters long by 1.30 wide, plus two rear wheels of 3.26 meters in diameter and 1600 kilos Lapacho wood built with 22 spokes. \\"La Pichona\\" was drawn by 16 horses, all solid blacks, who were called by their names. Using a five-foot whip and drawing circles in the air, without touching the animals, the wagon was mobilized for 80 km to transport wool and grain from the city of Carmen de Patagones to Stroeder (which end of the rail was until 1922, in the railway corridor coming from the city of Bah√≠a Blanca) where the route was normally 5 days and complications of time could be extended to 20 days. After returning to Patagones products from Buenos Aires. \\"La Pichona\\" was the last major-drawn transport and the location of the tracks until Patagones in 1922, the Pozzo Ardizzi family reduced communicating their actions near the sites that were not served by rail.

After several political efforts to rescue the cart had not proven, in 2009 the Pozzo Ardizzi family decided directly retrieve \\"La Pichona \\" and Alberto Pozzo Ardizzi requested for the restoration to the blacksmith Luis Facio. Upon completion of the work that required 8 months of arduous and meticulous work, \\"La Pichona\\", possibly one of the few vehicles of similar characteristics that are still in Argentina, was deposited in a square on January 8, 2011, between Bernal and Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen streets of the city of Carmen de Patagones province of Buenos Aires.

Beginnings Mick Wayne's first group was 'The Outsiders', with Jimmy Page on guitar. After recording one single for Decca Records in 1965, the Outsiders broke up the following year at which point Wayne joined Hull musicians 'The Hullaballoos', replacing Ricky Knight briefly before they too broke up. He made an attempt to form a new line-up in Hull with drummer John Cambridge but soon returned to London (Cambridge later joined Hull band 'The Rats', with guitarist Mick Ronson). Wayne next joined the 'Bunch of Fives' (including ex- Pretty Things drummer Viv Prince) during 1966 and this band evolved into 'The Tickle', with band members Mick Wayne (guitar), Mike Docker (vocals), Dave Williams (keyboards), Richard Dowling (bass) and John Beckerman (drums).Junior's Eyes biography, by David Wells - 'Battersea Power Station - Plus' liner notes (2000) The Tickle's only single - \\"Subway (Smokey Pokey World)\\" - has appeared on many psychedelic compilation albums, including Acid Drops, Spacedust & Flying Saucers: Psychedelic Confectionery. Junior's Eyes After the break-up of the Tickle, Mick Wayne formed Junior's Eyes in early 1968, initially with drummer John 'Candy' Carr and then with John 'Honk' Lodge (ex-Graham Bond Organisation) (bass) and Steve Chapman (drums). They recorded a debut single with the help of pianist Rick Wakeman and producer Tony Visconti. The trio added singer Graham 'Grom' Kelly and (briefly) organist John Redfern in late 1968 and began work on an album. Battersea Power Station was released in June 1969. That same month, Mick Wayne and Rick Wakeman were among the guest musicians who recorded David Bowie's breakthrough hit \\"Space Oddity\\". For the follow-up Space Oddity album recorded between June and September 1969, Bowie and producer Visconti were backed by a new line-up of Junior's Eyes comprising Mick Wayne (guitar), John 'Honk' Lodge (bass), John Cambridge (drums) and Tim Renwick (guitar, flute, recorder). The same band backed Bowie on a BBC Radio Dave Lee Travis Show session in October 1969, and (without Wayne) on single B-side \\"Conversation Piece\\", recorded in January 1970. Wayne had also helped record James Taylor's debut album between July and October 1968, and Honk had played on the album Think Pink (track \\"Rock and Roll the Joint\\") by Pretty Things drummer Twink in July 1969. These recording session for other artists disrupted the progress of the band, and the new line-up recorded only one single. They played their final gig on 3 February 1970, supporting Bowie. At this gig Cambridge introduced Bowie to his former 'Rats' bandmate Mick Ronson, and within days Cambridge, Ronson and Visconti (playing bass) were Bowie's new backing band 'The Hype', but Cambridge departed at the end of March. Later careers Honk and Renwick formed Quiver, but Honk soon left (briefly joining ex-Pink Fairies drummer Twink in the 'Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band' in Cambridge). Renwick continued with the band, which later joined up with the Sutherland Brothers, and he later recorded with Mike + The Mechanics and both Roger Waters and the David Gilmour-led Pink Floyd, as well as releasing a number of solo albums. Mick Wayne left for the USA after Junior's Eyes to back Joe Cocker, and spent a few years doing session work there before returning to London and joining a 1972 Steve Peregrin Took recording session along with Pink Fairies rhythm section Duncan Sanderson and Russell Hunter, whose band was temporarily defunct following the departure of guitarist Paul Rudolph. None of the tracks were completed to Took's satisfaction, due to what Wayne later described as \\"dope- induced thinking\\" and consequently, Wayne, Sanderson and Hunter formed a new incarnation of the Pink Fairies, releasing the single \\"Well, Well, Well\\" / \\"Hold On\\", as well as doing a radio session for BBC Radio One. However Sanderson and Hunter became unhappy with the musical direction Wayne was taking the band in, and they convinced Larry Wallis to join the group as a second guitarist and shortly afterwards sacked Wayne. He later formed pub-rock bands 'Juniors' and 'Ozo' in the mid-1970s before retiring from music. He was about to record a comeback solo album when he died in a fire at his producer's house in 1994.

It is one of the few organizations of its kind, specifically grouping Romanians who want to study, are studying, or have studied abroad. The main goal of LSRS is to develop the community of Romanian students and graduates of universities around the world, facilitating their contribution to Romania's democratic future. LSRS affirms that highly trained, young Romanians represent a strategic resource for the country's development and should be promoted within society as decisive factors for Romania's future success. History LSRS was founded by two Romanian students, Sebastian Burduja (Harvard University) and Costin Elefteriu (King's College London), in January 2009, who perceived a need to organize the ever-growing community of Romanians studying abroad. Now, this community numbers tens of thousands of people. LSRS is one of the fastest growing Romanian non-profits, gathering over 5,000 members (defined as registered users of their websitehttp://lsrs.ro/FAQ#howsignup) in two years of activity. It has signed an official Memorandum with the Romanian Senate, granting it special recognition from Romanian authorities and acknowledging, for the first time, the potential of Romanian students abroad. Organization LSRS is organized into branches on four continents. In 2010, there were 23 active branches, spanning most Western European countries, but also Turkey, China, Chile, Russia and others. Branches are headed by Coordinators, who have nearly complete control over the activities of the branch. The general direction is set by Coordinators together with the Executive Committee and the Director's Council. The Director's Council gathers the President, the Secretary General, and five Vice-presidents: Internal Relations, External Relations, Projects, Treasury, and Communications. The League is defined by a strong organizational culture. Members and volunteers commonly refer to it as ‚Äúthe family‚Äù or ‚Äúthe home away from home.‚Äù Activities LSRS has undertaken a wide variety of projects on a national and international scale. It seeks to promote good relations with other countries, supporting Romania's image around the world through the activities of its branches. Every year, LSRS branches around the world organize small and medium-sized events to promote the Romanian culture and traditions. The main celebrations take place on December 1 of every year, Romania's National Day. At the same time, LSRS organizes projects in Romania. The ‚ÄúLSRS Caravan‚Äù. takes Romanian students and alumni from abroad on a journey through Romanian high schools and colleges. There they provide advice and counseling for facilitating the admission of new students to top foreign universities. Equally important, the League organizes an annual Gala of Romanian Academic Excellence, offering prizes to the best and the brightest Romanian students abroad. The event routinely gathers around 800-1000 participants and in 2010 was held in the prestigious Palace of the Parliament (Casa Poporului). The League's policy is to invite civil society activists, journalists, but also politicians as representatives of the State. For instance, Romania's Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi was present in 2011, along with Mircea Geoana, President of the Romanian Senate, and Crin Antonescu, President of the National Liberal Party. The event has been tremendously successful in 2010-2011. The 2011 winner, Cristina Ghenoiu, is a world-leading specialist in cancer research at the Rockefeller Center. In Europe, Graduate Student of the Year went to a talented researcher called Radu Beleca from Brunel University. Another winner is Cristina Grigore, Romanian Fulbright Alumna at Vanderbilt University. LSRS also organized a Conference on Sustainable Development in the Black Sea Region, together with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), bringing together students, diplomats, and scholars to explore new development solutions. Another activity is the Jobs on the Horizon website, developed jointly with the Dinu Patriciu Foundation. The website provides an online job-search platform for Romanian graduates of foreign universities. In 2010, LSRS spoke out on the controversial subject of Rosia Montana, protesting against the potential mining operations by pointing out the environmental costs involved. The subject is still being debated in Romania as of February 2011. LSRS seeks to defend and promote the legal rights and academic, professional, social, and cultural interests of its members, and smoothens up the path toward a prosperous and democratic Romania. LSRS has been created for Romanian students and graduates abroad, as well as for other Romanians interested in studying outside their home country.

He became well known for his new matte feldspar glazed stoneware in hare's fur and crystal glazes and for his stoneware animal sculptures. Over five decades, Nylund crafted some 30 reliefs and sculptures commissioned for public spaces. Moreover, in the 1940s he was commissioned to do several freelance projects, including designing bathroom fixtures and interiors for the Swedish bathroom manufacturer If√∂. He also designed a number of products for refrigerator use. From 1955, he was artistic director for Str√∂mbergshyttans glassworks in Hovmantorp, and later freelanced for the company. In the early 1960s, Nylund returned to Copenhagen. There he started producing stoneware for Nym√∂lle Keramiska Fabrik in Lyngby. After a change of ownership at R√∂rstrand in the mid-1960s, he re-turned to Nym√∂lle as a freelancer, producing a more industrial class type of stoneware. At this time he also created Europe's largest stoneware fountain the ‚ÄúScanisarius‚Äù in Brom√∂lla, Sweden. Background Nylund was born in Paris in 1914, where his Danish mother, the artist Fernanda Jacobsen-Nylund and his Finland-Swedish father, the sculptor Felix Nylund, were studying. In 1917, the family moved to Copenhagen, moving later to Helsinki, where Nylund attended elementary school. When the Finnish civil war broke out, he moved with his mother in 1918 to Denmark and continued his studies at boarding school. Following graduation in 1923 and completing an architecture internship and studies in ceramics in Helsinki, he started studying architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Charlotteborg, Copenhagen. He became practiced in sculpture by assisting his father Felix, who encouraged him in the study of animals. Nylund did some extra work at the Bing & Grondahl Porcelain factory, designing new products for a Paris exhibition. He was then offered full-time employment by the company and as a result gave up his architecture studies. At Bing & Gr√∂ndahl, his mentor was Paul Gauguin's son Jean. Nylund created a few thousand unique pieces at Bing & Gr√∂ndahl. Gunnar Nylund was renowned for his revolutionary stoneware in matte glazes and novel colors, and also for the mass production that Nylund & Krebs started in Patrick Nordstr√∂m's workshop, which they later took over. Prior to a major exhibition in 1930 at Bo in Copenhagen, they launched SAXBO, a groundbreaking Nordic series of iconic stoneware, mostly undecorated in matte glazes and novel colors. The SAXBO stoneware generated a lot of attention at a Svenskt Tenn exhibition, the same year that Nylund was recruited to R√∂rstrand, at that time owned by Arabia. In order to start crafting stoneware the young ceramist was moved to the company's factory in Lidk√∂ping, which was relatively unknown at that time and which focused solely on porcelain production. There he succeeded, thanks to his own specially developed technique, to produce the first Swedish matte glazed stoneware and sculptures in shimmering colorful stoneware chamotte, which was very popular and had an important impact on modern Swedish ceramics. Nylund's stoneware at that time featured Song-inspired crackel√© and oxblood glazes ‚Äì pieces that ranged from monumental original sculptures in stoneware chamotte and two-feet high urns to moderately priced miniature vases and bowls. In the mid-1930s, the Chamotte was produced both in series and original sculptures. After a one- year break at Bing & Gr√∂ndahl in Denmark, R√∂rstrand's new chief Fredrik Wehtje managed to get Nylund to return to Lidk√∂ping in 1937. Here he designed numerous tableware series and laid the ground for all the factory's 1940s collections, featuring innovative glazes. Public works From the mid-1940s, Nylund devoted much of his time to reliefs and other work for the decoration of public spaces, for example the ‚ÄúTheater¬¨ Cavalcade‚Äù at the Malm√∂ Stadsteater, ‚ÄúThe Jungle Awakens‚Äù now found at the entrance of the library of the University of Agriculture in Uppsala, the ‚ÄúThree V√§stg√∂ter‚Äù, relief for the V√§stg√∂ta nation Uppsala, ‚ÄúLife in the square‚Äù for Lidk√∂ping's Sparbank, ‚ÄúOur Times‚Äù relief for the G√∂te-borgsposten, ‚ÄúSymfonica‚Äù relief for the m/s Gripsholm ship, as well as altarpieces, etc., for the Lidk√∂ping crematorium, the altar of Skara cathedral and the ‚ÄúThorn of Crowns‚Äù. He also created sculptures such as ‚ÄúSt. George and the Dragon‚Äù for the National Institute of Arts and Crafts and the ‚ÄúMermaid‚Äù fountain for the National Museum in Stockholm in 1943, a work that has been moved to the R√∂rstrand museum in Lidk√∂ping, where other reliefs such as ‚ÄúThe oven is empty‚Äù are found. Sculptures in museums Most of Nylund's original sculptures in stoneware chamotte ended up in museums, as did much of his other work. For example, the impressive ‚ÄúLion Head‚Äù is found at the National Museum in Stockholm, ‚ÄúBlue Bird‚Äù is at the S√®vres museum in Paris, his antelope head ‚ÄúAbyssinian mountain nyala‚Äù, is at the R√∂hsska museet in Gothenburg and the ‚ÄúHamadryas Baboon‚Äù is at the Malm√∂ Museum. The museum in Riga is home to the ‚ÄùMagnus Gabriel de la Gardie‚Äù, and the Danish Museum of Art & Design houses the ‚ÄúHannover‚Äù portrait, among other works. His piece ‚ÄúBulls head in oxblood‚Äù was bought by the Ateneum museum in Helsinki. And a lot of his other work can be found at other museums around the world. Literature exhibitions Gunnar Nylund's work and a number of his many tableware collections and kitchen series are included in most reference books on 20th century ceramics. However, such information contains inaccuracies, which is why he has elected to publish his memoires. In the book he tells of his life and most of his work in conversation with his daughter Bie Nylund. The book also contains press clippings as well as a lot of photographs cataloging Nylund's great collections primarily from his half century with R√∂rstrand as well as his other activities, even after 1970 - as a pensioner with a workshop in Lomma, Sweden. He describes the many exhibitions he designed and arranged. The book is expected to be published at the end of 2012/early 2013 in conjunction with the anniversary of his most important Swedish exhibitions: Gallerie Moderne in Stockholm, R√∂hsska museum in Gothenburg 1932-33 and the chamotte exhibition in the mid-1930s, and the hugely successful exhibition ‚ÄúR√∂rstrand through three centuries‚Äù at the National Museum in Stockholm 1943.

The barracks are situated at the southern edge of the city, south of Colinton, and adjacent to the Edinburgh City Bypass. History The present barracks complex was largely built in 1937‚Äì1939 to designs by William Alexander Ross. The barracks were upgraded in 1989‚Äì1992, with the addition of several new buildings. The four original buildings are protected as a category C(s) listed building. The barracks were built in the grounds of Dreghorn Castle, a 17th-century mansion built by Sir William Murray, Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland. The castle was extended around 1805 by Archibald and James Elliot. The castle was acquired by the War Office in 1893, and was eventually demolished in 1955. A monument outside the barracks on Redford Road commemorates the insurgent covenanters of the Pentland Rising who were defeated at the Battle of Rullion Green in 1666. The monument was erected in 1884 by R A Macfie of Dreghorn House, and incorporates columns taken from the 18th-century Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, designed by William Adam and demolished the previous year.

He was a member of the exploration party led by surgeon Belgrave Ninnis which explored areas west of the Adelaide River as far as Howard River and King Creek on HMS Beatrice and arrived at Port Darwin in April 1865. =Murders of Aborigines= During the Finniss expedition Auld was involved in a punitive expedition against a tribe of Aborigines from Chambers Bay, some from Escape Cliffs, who had stolen goods and seriously wounded several horses with their spears. During this action an aboriginal man was shot, presumed dead, and Auld was accused of the crime. (from a letter from Auld to his father) :The Colonel (Finniss)Northern Territory, Settlement of Australian States and Territories - \\"in 1864. Colonel Boyle Travers Finniss was responsible for the settlement,\\" then gave orders that seven horsemen were to be in readiness to start next morning and try to find the natives' camp, and recover the goods they had stolen from us, and to treat them as felons. I went over to Chambers' Bay with two men, acting as scouts. Fifty (natives) tried to surround us. I shot at one, and sent one of the men to tell the footmen to come to our assistance. They were showing real fighting. Directly the footmen made their appearance the blacks disappeared like magic into the shrub. We recovered a quantity of the stores and goods. The Doctor, (Dr Walker, Protector of Aborigines) I believe, has brought a charge against me for shooting the black. He sent it to the Governor, but he would not receive it; so I hear be intends sending it to Adelaide.

There have been two shot by our party here; one, I think was justifiable, and the other a cold-blooded murder. The two deaths referred to were presumably that inflicted by Alaric Ward (no relation to Ebenezer Ward, mentioned below) on 9 August 1864 and that of 8 September 1864 for which Auld was charged. At the trial no evidence was brought for the prosecution, rather there was a report that the man shot at (named Dombey or Bombey) was still alive.South Australian News, Perth Gazette and W.A.

The idea of default traps is related with the asymmetric information between the borrower and the lender about the expectation of borrower's future output (GDP), the negative output shocks that increase the borrower's future default probability and other possible factors like political shocks. The definitions were mostly based on this paper. Two phenomenon in sovereign debt =Vicious circles of borrowing and default= In sovereign borrowing history, borrowing and default happened periodically. In the 1820s, the wave of loans to most of the newly independent nations of Latin America was followed by widespread default. Later, all the waves of lending to foreign governments in the 1870s, in the late 1920s, in the 1930s, in the 1980s and in recent years were seen with at least some occurrence of repayment breakdown. For instance, Argentina defaulted or restructured its debts for 4 times during 1824 to 1999, Brazil 7 times, Egypt twice, Philippines once, Chile 3 times, Colombia 7 times, Mexico 8 times, Turkey 6 times and Venezuela did this 9 times during the same period. The average default or restructure frequency among the above 9 countries was 5.2 times. According to institutional investor ratings in September 2002 based on the default history of the above countries, the average repay probability of these countries is 41.6 which is lower than other emerging market countries without default history during the same time. For example, from 1824 to 1999, India, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand have no default history and each of their default probability is over 45 and the average probability of them is 61.7. It is apparent that the Latin American countries mentioned above borrow periodically but default for multiple times and therefore were prone to fall into serial default . In the literature, Lindert and Morton find that countries defaulted over 1820-1929 were 69 per cent more likely to default in the 1930s and that those that incurred arrears and concessionary scheduling during 1940-79 were 70 per cent more likely to default in the 1980s. Rogoff, Reinhart, and Savastano indicates that serial default is only loosely related to countries‚Äô indebtedness levels and other fundamentals. They show that serial defaulters have lower credit ratings and face higher spreads (spread is defined as the borrower's debt interest rate minus risk free interest rate) at relatively low indebtedness levels. =Default rarely entail permanent exclusion but re-pricing of country risk (higher interest rate)= Different from domestic debts, in international lending, there is no explicit mechanism deterring a government from repudiating its external debts. However, the international capital market may still take a number of retaliatory actions to penalize defaulting debtors. Permanent exclusion from international capital market (Eaton and Gersovitz) or random re-entry rules which are not price-dependent (Aguiar and Gopinath) (Arellano) are regarded as the crucial ways to punish and restrict the borrowers‚Äô decision to choose default in early literature. But the two ways are too difficult to perform in reality. The more consistent assumption with the reality and which will help to understand default traps is that default is often punished by a worsening of the terms on which the country can borrow again. In the renegotiation process after default, the defaulting country pays the higher rate of return (relative to a risk-free rate) on debt (for example a new bond) that is issued subsequently than non-defaulting countries. Default traps mechanism The above two phenomenon are explained by including two structural features: high conditional volatility of output, a well-documented fact in Kose et al. and in Arellano and Cat√£o and Kapur that higher output volatility tends to raise higher interest rates; high persistence in output shocks discussed in Aguiar and Gopinath that greater output persistence tends to raise sovereign default risk. From these literatures, it is clearly that countries with more volatile and persistent output shocks are more likely to face higher spreads (lower debt issuing price) and thus more likely to fall into default traps. Without output shock persistence, default will not have information on the expected future output and future default probability and thus on the change of the future debt to expected output ratio. Volatility on the one hand increases the need for international borrowing to help smooth domestic consumption and on the other hand causes low enough output realizations for borrowers to default. Apart from the above two features, asymmetric information between the borrowers and the lenders on the nature of the borrowers‚Äô output shocks is also a key to the default traps. In terms of asymmetric information assumption, borrowers are better informed than lenders about the persistence of their output shocks. If borrowers default at first period, upon observing this default, lenders will make an inference about the likely realization of the magnitude of borrowers‚Äô first period shocks indirectly and update their expectations to be pessimistic on borrowers‚Äô future output and their repayment prospects on future loans. Although borrowers can get fresh lending again, they need to pay higher interest rates than the case they did not default in the past. The gap between the interest rates for fresh lending with and without past default is defined as default premium, which can also be seen as the difference between the new debt issue prices with and without past default. Therefore, if borrowers default, they will face a positive default premium, namely higher interest rates and lower new debt issuing price. If the investment requirement is relatively inelastic, in another word, the amount of investment requirement relatively not affected by debt issuing price, borrowers have to issue more debts to compensate for low issue prices to acquire the required amount of investment. As a result, the ratio of debt to expected output increases and induce a higher probability of future default. Debt-to-GDP ratio and default probability The final important chain in the default trap mechanism is that the increase in the ratio of debt to output will induce a higher probability of future default. Is this positive relationship between debts to output ratio with default probability true? Rogoff, Reinhart, and Savastano supported this relationship by tracing a history of default back to 1820s. In their conclusion, they argued that the safe international debt to GNP threshold are low, perhaps as low as 15 percent in some cases and country-specific threshold depends on a country's default history. The probability of default for a given debt-to-GNP level is increasing with the number of past defaults. Moreover, If a country ever defaulted before, even a lower debt to output ratio may be enough to make it default again compared with another country of the same debt level but of no default history. The higher the ratio to output it is, the higher the risk of the default it will be. From the 1970s to 2002, the 9 Latin American default countries like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Mexico, Philippines, Turkeys and Venezuela had their average institutional investor ratings (approximate as repayment probability) as 39.4 and average debt to GNP ratio as 44.1, while the no default countries like India, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand had 61.8 as their repayment probability and 27 as average debt to GNP ratio. De Paoli, Hoggarth and Saporta demonstrated the relationship between external debt-to-GDP ratio, bond spreads and credit ratings in figure1. In the left panel of figure1, given an external debt-to- GDP ratio, most past defaulters have higher bond spreads (high new bonds issuing price) than non-defaulters, although Chile and Egypt are exceptions. In the right panel of figure 1, we can see that most past defaulters have a higher debt to GNP ratio but lower repayment probability (higher default probability) than non-defaulters. Expansion on default traps =Political shock and default probability= Apart from economic conditions, Political factors play a nontrivial role as determinants of defaults as well. Tomz and Wright reported that even though most default activities occur in periods of low output, the correlation between default decisions and economic conditions is weaker than that implied by existing quantitative models of sovereign default (without political turnover). Political shocks may probability induce default decision in addition to output shocks. The political turnover, says the replacement of a patient (investor-friendly) government by an impatient (less investor-friendly) government is likely to lead to a political default on sovereign debt. Default risk becomes higher after the government turnover. Take Argentina for example to see the relationship between political turnover and the defaults. After president De La Rua resigned on December 20, 2001, Congress appointed Rodriguez Saa as the interim president on December 23, 2001, and the next day, Rodriguez Saa announced the suspension of all payments on debt instruments (similar to default), which was linked to a decline in sovereign bond prices (post-default spreads lower than pre-default spreads). If we compare the mean value of the index of political risk in the eight years prior to the default date with the mean value between the default date and June 2006, the pre-default mean value of the index is 74.4, and the post- default value is 64.3. A higher value of the index indicates less political risk. These figures show that this government turnover in Argentina was related with higher post-default governments default risk than that of the pre-default governments in the subsequent debt. =Lender‚Äôs limited memory and upper limits of credit history= In the case that lenders have the limited memory about the borrower's default history, the credit history will be upgraded at a certain point (the upper limits of credit history) and the default probability will be lower than in the case lenders of full memory. In a word, as the credit history increase, the default probability is weakly increased, given a debt-to-GDP ratio. It may be that at one point, the credit history is upgraded so quickly that the default probability decreases. This is because the periods which the country needs to pay default premium are so short, the impact of default premium on the default probability is quite small. =Remedies for default traps= What policies should countries adopt to avoid the problem of default traps? Default trap is a chronic long term problem to address. Policymakers in emerging markets need to internalize the country-specific ‚Äúsafe‚Äù debt threshold which depends heavily on the country's default and inflation history. They need to calculate the true long-term costs of defaulting. They also need to be aware that default often exacerbates the problems in the weak fiscal structures and weak financial systems, making these countries more prone to future default. Other factors from economic, political and institutional perspectives are also needed to be considered to find the safe debt threshold.

It is assigned to Tenth Air Force under the Air Force Reserve Command and is based in Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. When mobilized, Air Combat Command directs group assets into theater to support wartime tasking and other operations, like humanitarian relief. United States Northern Command may gain group assets directly to support disaster relief, search and rescue tasking in the aftermath of catastrophic events like hurricane, tornado, wildfire, flooding and earthquake, when they occur in the US, or its territories. The group and its subordinate squadrons are assigned to the 920th Rescue Wing based at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida. Mission The mission of the 943rd Rescue Group is to provide leadership, management, policy formulation, planning, and standardization for operations, training and support of Air Force Reserve Command rescue assets, consisting of 3 squadrons and 3 flights at Davis-Monthan AFB and 1 additional squadron at Portland Air Reserve Station, Oregon. The group is equipped with six (6) Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base to support worldwide combat rescue operations. As an Air Force Reserve Command unit, the 943rd is under the control of the 920th Rescue Wing at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida and is the only Air Force Reserve rescue unit in the Southwestern United States. Upon mobilization, the 943rd would come under the control of the Air Combat Command. History =Need for reserve troop carrier groups= After May 1959, the reserve flying force consisted of 45 troop carrier squadrons assigned to 15 troop carrier wings.There were an additional four rescue squadrons not assigned to the wings. Cantwell, p. 156 The squadrons were not all located with their parent wings, but were spread over thirty-five Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept. The concept offered several advantages. Communities were more likely to accept the smaller squadrons than the large wings and the location of separate squadrons in smaller population centers would facilitate recruiting and manning.Cantwell, pp. 156, 169 However, under this concept, all support organizations were located with the wing headquarters.Cantwell, p. 156 Although this was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult. This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961. To resolve this, at the start of 1962, Continental Air Command, (ConAC) determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed.Cantwell, pp. 189‚Äì191 =Activation of the 943rd Troop Carrier Group= As a result, the 943rd Troop Carrier Group was established at March Air Force Base, California on 17 January 1963 as the headquarters for the 729th Troop Carrier Squadron, which had been stationed there since October 1960.Maurer, pp. 724‚Äì725 Along with group headquarters, a Combat Support Squadron, Materiel Squadron and a Tactical Infirmary were organized to support the 729th. The group was equipped with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars for Tactical Air Command airlift operations. The group was one of four C-119 groups assigned to the 452nd Troop Carrier Wing in 1963. The others were the 942nd and 944th Troop Carrier Groups, also at March, and the 945th Troop Carrier Group at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The group flew routine tactical airlift missions in the western states, inactivating its Flying Boxcars in 1969. It then was moved east to Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina, where it was updated to the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter heavy intercontinental transport. the group's crews augmented Military Airlift Command units for strategic airlift missions worldwide, including contingency and humanitarian operations and took part in strategic mobility exercises for training. Inactivated in 1973 as part of an Air Force Reserve reorganization. Reactivated at March Air Force Base in 1985 with Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports. Inactivated in 1993 when the 302nd Tactical Airlift Wing was moved to Norton Air Force Base and the reserve's C-141s were moved to March. =Rescue Group= The 943rd Rescue Group was reactivated in the Air Force Reserve on 12 February 2005 at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.

They organized a total of 21 action-exhibitions during the group‚Äôs active period. In that period Jerman experimented with photography producing grey, unfocused photographs. He also created photo collages, making further interventions with the media by using different photo techniques, photo chemicals, texts, drawings, colours etc. He would also frequently cut and partially burn the final products. Further experimentation lead him to apply chemicals directly onto the photo surface without the use of a camera. He also became interested in multimedia art and started using text more frequently in his work. One of his most famous installations is This is not my world, a sentence that he wrote on photo paper with developer in 1976, and exhibited on a street in Belgrade.

Like all ascidians, these sessile animals are filter feeders.WoRMS - World Register of Marine Species - Pycnoclavella diminuta (Kott, 1957) Description Pycnoclavela diminuta lives in colonies composed of small clusters of zooids that originate from a common stalk. Each zooid is approximately in length. They are golden yellow-orange in colour and have white spots. The spots vary in shape and size, but are well defined, and are consistent throughout the colony. This species can be confused with Pycnoclavella flava (formerly Clavina flava), which may also have white spots. But Pycnoclavela diminuta can be differentiated in that the spots are always clearly defined and always constant. Distribution This species occurs in numerous locations, including: *Western Pacific Ocean *Indo-West Pacifichttp://www.sealifebase.org/Summary/speciesSummary.php?GenusName=Archidistoma&SpeciesName;=richeri *Australiahttp://www.sealifebase.org/summary/speciessummary.php?id=93835 *Lord Howe Island *New Caledonia *Indonesia *Philippines Behaviour Pycnoclavella diminuta is a sessile suspension feeder. Habitat This ascidian lives in depths from 5 to 20 metres in the benthic zone in caves and under ledges. It often occurs in environments with soft corals such as Dendronephthya and Scleronephthya.

RNAS Kingsnorth was commissioned in April 1914 under the control of the Admiralty, first through the Naval Airship Branch, then through the Royal Naval Air Service when the Royal Navy reformed its air branch in July 1914.Naval Aviation History & FAA Origins - Fleet Air Arm Archive The RNAS took over the base's two huge airship sheds and its development and training functions. =Flying Units= RNAS Kingsnorth initially used the first two airships: Astra Torres No. 3 and Parseval No.4, to escort troopships carrying the British Expeditionary Force to France in the summer of 1914. RNAS Kingsnorth was involved in the development and flight testing of non-rigid airships, with the SS-class airship (Submarine Scout) being the first type to operate from there, providing anti-submarine defences to the Thames Estuary and southeast coast. The C-Class airship (Coastal Class) type followed, with aircrews trained at the site until the then-named RNAS Cranwell took over this role mid-war. By the start of 1915, there were less than 100 British airmen who could actually fly an airship. It was then decided that RNAS Kingsnorth would be used as a flying training station. Students who had completed the free ballooning courses and ground instruction at RNAS Wormwood Scrubs, would then be passed on to RNAS Kingsnorth for instruction at an operational airship station. Intensive training was given to the pupils, and due to the operational requirements for qualified pilots, the initial stage was omitted and student aircrew found themselves on the immediate instruction course on an operational airship. Training was given in both theory and practice, with students completing courses in aeronautics, navigation, metrology, engineering, and practical flying. Instruction was given in Submarine Scout ships which were perfectly suited as they had a two- seater configured fuselage. Testing of the NS-class airship (North Sea) also took place at RNAS Kingsnorth, with successful flight trials first completed in February 1917. =Aviation Support Units= By 1914, RNAS Kingsnorth was also home to a newly formed Naval Met Service, which provided weather information to airships operating locally over the North Sea. Royal Air Force (1918-1921) On 1 April 1918 the Royal Flying Corps and the RNAS combined to form the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the station became known as RAF Kingsnorth before decommissioning in 1921. The site is now occupied by Kingsnorth Power Station.

It then continues by forecasting the position of the European Union (EU) for the first decades on the 2000s. Summary The EU is a response to and function of Europe's unique historical experience. The past decade has shown that there is policy space for greater EU engagement in European security, although the EU has not been able to play all roles with the same degree of accomplishment. There are particular concerns over its security and defence dimension where attempts at pooling resources and forming a political consensus have failed to generate the results expected. These trends, combined with shifts in global power patterns, have been accompanied by a shift in EU strategic thinking whereby great-power ambitions have been scaled down and replaced by a tendency towards hedging vis-√†-vis the leading powers. On an operational level the track record shows that the EU's effectiveness is hampered by a \\"consensus‚Äì expectations gap\\", owing primarily to the lack of an effective decision-making mechanism. The sum of these developments is that the EU will not be a great power, and is taking the place of one of the small powers in the emerging multipolar international order.(summarized on page 11). Critiques The book received warm reviews from Robert Kagan: \\"The great strength of Asle's Toje Absorbing, detailed and much-Needed study is to show What role the European Union Might Be Expected to play under multipolarity\\".

He was baptized in the parish church of St. Mary Major (Santa Maria Maggiore) on March 27, and was given the name Nicola. His father was called Giovanni, an honest and religious man, a good farmer endowed with the simple and popular wisdom of the old country families of Abruzzo. His mother, Virginia Ferrara was a strong but considerate woman, known for her piety and Christian spirit. She was able to transmit to her son a genuine religious sense of life, sensitiveness, an outstanding kindness and peace of mind. On the Feast of Corpus Domini, June 8, 1950, he received his first Holy Communion and three years later on October 17, 1953, he was confirmed. He went to the primary school in Villamagna, close to Madonna del Carmine, where according to the teachers and his contemporaries, he distinguished himself for his diligence, kindness and availability for others. He never missed serving Holy Mass at the parish church, where he was constant even in winter, though his home was several kilometers away, at the border with neighboring Bucchianico, the birthplace of St. Camilles de Lellis. At the seminary in Rome A priest of the religious order of St. Camilles, a native of his village, invited him to join the Camillian seminary in Rome. Nicola accepted the proposal with joy and he immediately revealed his decision to his parents. But they objected. Because, his mother wanted him to go to the diocesan seminary in the neighboring town of Chieti, and his father did not want to lose the promising strong hands for the fields. Even his two unmarried paternal aunts, who lived with the family, were blandishing him with the promise of making him the sole heir if he could only stay. All the life of little Nicola was simple and genuine. The opposition from his family lasted for a year. Nicola lived this period in prayer and study, until he finally obtained the permission to join the Seminary of St. Camilles in Rome. It was on October 3, 1955 that he entered, the feast of St. Theresa of Lisieux, of the Child Jesus, who would later become his spiritual guide. Though the Seminary was brimming with students, just like all other centers for vocation to the priesthood at that time, the young Nicola did not escape the notice of those who were supposed to observe the distinguishing signs of a true vocation. They immediately noticed in him the determination to model his total personality, entrusting himself completely to the superiors to guide him spiritually. Two years later, he came to know that his father wanted to withdraw him and take him back home. He then wrote a strong letter about his resolute decision to continue with the formation to the Priesthood in the Order of St. Camilles, whatever that would cost. He gave many motivations in support of his decision, among which was the saying of St. John Bosco: \\"The most beautiful blessing for a family is to have a son Priest.\\" (1) As a novice On October 6, 1960, he was dressed for the first time in the Habit of the religious order of St. Camilles, which marked the beginning of the novitiate year. At the end of the spiritual exercises, for this important stage in his life, he wrote: \\"...Jesus, if one day I have to throw the sacred Habit, like many do, please let me die before I receive it for the first time; I am not afraid of dying at this moment, now that I have your grace. What a gracious thing to be able to come and see You together with Your and my mother: Mary.\\" (2) Throughout the year of the novitiate he wrote in his \\"Diary\\" his objectives and small victories, moments of struggle and spiritual dryness. From his writings, one notices a strong will to continue in pursuit of the divine call, entrusting himself to God's help, which is synthesized in this statement: \\"We can win the evil only by staying close to Jesus and Mary with the Sacraments and prayer.\\" (3) Already at this moment, he intensively lived the spirituality of the Order of St. Camilles. This was observed especially when he had to assist an older brother who was seriously ill from cancer in the throat. It is particularly important to remember what he said to this priest on the feast of Good Friday that year: \\"Father, unite your pains to those of Christ in agony, today is Good Friday, a blessed day for you who suffers together with Jesus.\\" (4) The first religious vows On the morning of October 7, 1961, the feast of the Blessed Virgin of the Rosary, after a year of intense training, which his superiors judged excellent, he took the vows of Poverty, Chastity, Obedience and Charity towards the sick even in cases of contagious diseases. These vows were binding for three years. So on that day he started a period of formation as a professed Camillian religious. He was serene and content, available to everyone, observed well the dispositions of community life with humility and simplicity, was assiduous at prayer and diligent in his studies. His immediate Superiors, -the Provincial and the mentor of the clerics, - were his guide and the witnesses to his slow but continuous advancement on the way to the top of the Holy Mountain of God. He had a deep love for the Eucharistic Jesus, whom he received every day and visited often during the day in the church of the Seminary or in the chapel of the Gregorian University. He even enrolled himself to the \\"Guard of Honor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus,\\" choosing the time from 8.00 am to 9.00 am as his hour of reparation. (5) He had both a filial and tender devotion to the Virgin Mary and a strong devotion to St. Theresa of the Child Jesus, making his own her spirituality of the little way. He had a profound love for his Father and Founder, St. Camilles, and deeply studied his spirituality while dreaming about future intense days of work and service to the sick, when he would finally become a priest one day. He was not afraid to show to anybody, his enthusiasm for the vocation in the Order of St. Camilles. Being diligent in his studies, he took his scholastic duties seriously and both loved and respected his teachers. He was docile and careful, anxious to receive the knowledge that was being imparted, because he considered it necessary for the good exercise of his Priesthood at the service of the suffering brothers. During the short period of life as a student of the religious Order of the Camillians, he showed great love and attachment to his new family. He limited his outings, and preferred to stay in the House to dedicate his heart, mind and time to the several necessities and the most urgent needs of the religious community. The time of suffering and illness Towards the end of 1962 he started to feel the first symptoms of the illness that would later lead to his death at the age of 21. He obediently accepted the decisions of his Superiors and doctors from the very beginning. In June 1963, he was operated upon in the Urological Ward of St. Camilles Hospital in Rome. (6) The result of the histological analysis made on the removed part gave the indisputable answer of a certain end: cancer. (7) During his recovery at the Hospital chaplaincy after the operation, he revealed himself as a person who is always patient and smiling, careful not to disturb his brothers who were concern for him. Afterwards, on August 19, he was admitted to the Polyclinic Umberto 1st of Rome for the cobalt-therapy, because his doctor had the secret hope of circumscribing the illness. From the 24th of the same month he continued this therapy at the outpatient clinic of the same hospital. His behavior during this period is a great example to all, both for his patience in tolerating the pain and the willingness to do the will of God. No matter what it was. As to whether he already by this summer knew or at least suspected to be suffering from a serious illness, could be deduced from a note found in his papers, where he wrote: \\"End of June: in 2-3 days it assumes enormous proportions. Treatment of Penicillin and Strepto dissolved with vitamins B and C,\\" and ahead -besides the dates of admission at the two hospitals in Rome and of the surgical operations - he wrote: \\"12/8- Beginning of the treatments with gamma- rays and not gamma (200 in a day)...20/8, VIIth application, two X-rays of the lungs, blood tests...23/8, Xth application, 22 X-rays to the digestive apparatus...\\" When the Academic Year resumed in autumn, his superiors enrolled him in the first year of philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University, even though he was already seriously affected by the cancer. (8) Even here, his diligence, serenity and kindness were noted by the teachers and the other students. At the beginning of January 1964 another X-ray was performed on the thorax. The right lung appeared largely infected by the illness. (9) Even though nobody up to now had talked to him about the gravity of his state, and on the contrary all were trying to hide from him the reality of his now hopeless situation, Nicola definitively realized his actual state of health. This can be deduced from a conversation he had with his brother, Tommaso, in which he alluded to the certainty of his approaching death, but that his only worry was the great suffering his death would cause to their mother. (10) Towards the end of March that year, he asked for a meeting with the provincial superior, in order to know from him the exact truth about his state of health. With his back against the wall, the superior was unable to hide the truth, which he accompanied with words of great hope especially trust in the goodness and power of God, to whom nothing is impossible, even a great miracle like the one Nicola needed. After knowing the truth about his health, he did not react with desperation, on the contrary, after a moment of intense reflection spent before the Eucharistic Jesus in the church of the Seminary, he recovered his usual smile and intensified his prayers, giving more time to meditation. When he had the occasion to talk with some friends about his approaching death, he neither avoided the topic nor dramatized about it, he spoke with serenity and detachment. People who lived with him remember that he gave them the impression of a person who was already living the reality of the life to come, as something already present in his existence, which was very prematurely drawing to its end. They still strongly remember that his conversation about life after death was calm and peaceful, with no strain or fanaticism, and a great spirit of faith enlightened his life, which he continued to conduct normally, sharing in the common life of the Seminary. With a hidden hope of obtaining a great miracle, his Superiors decided to send him on a pilgrimage to Lourdes and Lisieux. Nicola accepted to go, out of obedience, but he went above all with the intention of beseeching the help of the Immaculate Virgin and his little, great Saint Theresa, to do God's will up to the last hour, peacefully united with the Cross of Christ. It was May 10, only 33 days before his meeting with God for the eternity. To God with all himself With the dispensation \\"super triennium\\" Pope Paul VI allowed him to take the Perpetual Vows. On May 28, the feast of Corpus Domini, in the church of the Camillian Seminary, he consecrated himself to God forever; it was the last act of love of a short life, lived fervently through \\"praying and loving\\". The morning of June 5, feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in full consciousness, he accepted to receive the Anointing of the Sick as his Provincial Superior had proposed. It was a moment of intense commotion for all his brothers, at the end of the Holy Mass celebrated in the small room on the ground floor where he had been placed for some months now, in order to facilitate his movements that were by now only possible in a wheel-chair, and where he received his numerous friends and his mother. An awful, dramatic and continuous pain marked the last days of his life on earth. The cancer, which advanced and completely invaded his lungs, did not only cause terrific pain, but also moments of suffocation. Nicolino lived this pain heroically, united to the Cross of Christ, invoking help from the Virgin Mary and the Saints Camilles and Theresa of Lisieux, always calm and never abandoning himself to desperation, careful not to inconvenience those assisting him and trying to do his very best to hide the inevitable mask of suffering in order to avoid bringing sorrow to his mother, who stayed close by him. This extraordinary confidence in God's will is a cause for admiration and devotion even for those who knew him from childhood. A flower at the heart of God The last day for Nicolino came on June 12, 1964. It was a long agony, which started at 16.00 to close his last evening at 21.15, after a day spent in prayer and manifestation of his deep faith and burning Love for Jesus and Mary, with the help of his two beloved Saints and the comfort of the touching prayers of the brothers and friends. Up till now, his superior remembers his last moments thus: \\"I would lead the prayers and all the young brothers reunited around him in his small room would answer with hearts full of faith. Sometimes he would ask us to continue, saying: again, again, ....stronger , now and then he would add his own personal invocations to ours, which revealed his deep faith in an ultrasensitive reality that he felt really near.\\"(11) This contact with the ultrasensitive world was also noticed by other people who assisted at his death. Heaven opened its doors to him while he, lucid up to the end, continuously repeated the act of offering his life and all his pains, refusing the analgesics and inviting those present to pray with him and for him. A conclusion, very much coherent with the ideals he had chosen to live up to in his life. The strong impression that with his death a Passion was accomplished, can be noticed in the simple words of a country lady, an old family friend: \\"Having verified his death, the doctor opened the door and said to his mother: Lady, here is your son! Just as if it were the Virgin Mary receiving her crucified Son.\\"(12). A confr√®re who was a great friend of Nicola wrote during the days immediately after his death: \\"Now down here with us remains only a cut stem, his stem. The flower is up there, engrossed in the Heart of God. For this reason every time that I think or speak of beloved Nicola I feel I have to look up there as in a dream, bowing. My Hero! I had seen vaguely, I had only dreamed the ideal of holiness, without reaching it, because to touch something you've got to be close to it, and to have an admiration with no obscurity, you've got to be similar to the hero who inspires it. I've touched my hero and then...he seems to vanish. But, like the little Theresa with Celina, I believe that he will always walk at the side of every person who is able to discover him. I loved him, he died in my arms, and he looked at me with his last gaze, waving his hand to me to say \\"goodbye.\\" I love him, by now he's my great, little Saint together with his, and my little Theresa.\\" (13) Waiting for the Resurrection At the sacred funeral rites there was a great multitude of conf√®res, friends and acquaintances. His mother's sad and tormented prayers persuaded the superiors to allow the burial of the remains of Nicola D'Onofrio in Villamagna, his birthplace, in the family grave. His last journey back home was on June 15, accompanied by his confr√®res and superiors. After the Solemn Requiem Mass he was buried in the Ferrara Chapel, his mother's family. Since October 8, 1979, Nicola D'Onofrio rests near the Crypt of the Sanctuary of St. Camilles in Bucchianico, reunited to his religious family, waiting for the Resurrection of the last day, when Christ who triumphed over death will come again. ...IT COMES FROM AFAR! The way he touched people who were close to him or those who managed to know him during the well-known period of his rapid end, which he faced with serenity and with a smile on his lips, proves his exceptional behavior. But this was not improvised or even superficial. His ascent to the Holy Mountain of God comes from afar. The pages of his original writings reveal to us that this way started from the first days of his life at the Camillian Seminary. The last period of his existence and his death are only the revealing moment of his spiritual dimension. THE SPIRITUAL INHERITANCE The extraordinary wave of affective and religious emotions that accompanied his death, which was rendered more tragic by the terrible suffering caused by the sickness, is to be attributed to the fact that: \\"In suffering one becomes a completely new person... When this body is seriously sick, completely disabled and the person is almost incapable of living and acting, then one's inner maturity and spiritual greatness become more manifest, thus offering a touching lesson for all the normal and healthy people. (14) Except for arbitrary cases of incomprehension, all people felt that God had stimulated extraordinary answers in his soul, and that his journey to the Holy Mountain was really fast. A religious woman, his contemporary and friend since childhood, wrote that on learning of his death she felt the words of Wisdom ringing in her heart: \\"Having come to perfection so soon, he has lived long; his soul being pleasing to the Lord, he has hurried away from the wickedness around him.\\" (Wis. 4:13-14a) Such a conclusion to life cannot be improvised. It comes from afar and the moment of death is only the occasion that reveals the interior work done. And he founded it essentially upon the Passion and Cross of the Lord Jesus, with his eyes always fixed on the Glory of the Resurrection. This is clear from his \\"Writings\\" and from the testimony of the people who knew him. FROM HIS WRITINGS The key to understanding his spiritual journey appears almost immediately at the beginning of his new life in the minor seminary, when listening to a meditation on the love of God the Father for Man, during the annual Spiritual Retreat, he wrote: \\"We could say that he was not concerned for his only Son, if only he could save us. Jesus died for us and his blood, up to the last drop, washed our soul. How much Jesus loved us!\\"(16) And some few months later, at the end of the monthly retreat, he notes down a dictated meditation in this way: \\"Jesus has come into the world to glorify the Father who sent him, and to come down here \\"exinanivit se\\" he annihilated, humbled himself. The Incarnation, the Crucifixion, the Eucharist, are acts of self-destruction for the love he has for us, and for the glory of the Father. Now it is upon us to follow him, in order to give to the Sacred Heart that due glory as a response to his love.\\"(17) ...CRUCIFIED JESUS, HIS MODEL The crucified Christ entered his life and became his daily reference. The religious life that he started with the Novitiate during the Vespers on October 6, 1960, is a good school for the spirit which convinced him of the necessity to control the human faculty necessary for the practice of mysticism: the will. For a whole year, the messages received from his spiritual guides found him well disposed at the eve of the first religious vows consecrating him to God. He writes thus at the end of the first day of spiritual exercises: \\"The will has to be strong, complete, and heroic in the mystical ascent. One that does not change direction according to the winds, but remains faithful to the principles of the Crucified Christ. A will, which is not caught up in the many fatuities of this world, but stays vibrant and strong in sustaining and facilitating the progress of our journey towards God. Moreover, our ascent requires a heroic will because the goal is difficult. We aim at imitating a crucified Christ, who does not present to us anything else but the Cross, to embrace everyday. Heroic too, because our ascent is not in phases, but continuous and demanding, an ascent which ought to consume us completely. But to reach this point Confession and Spiritual Direction are indispensable. (18) \\"I am glad to have had the opportunity to assist beloved Father Del Greco, during the night between Wednesday and Holy Thursday. During this night there was the adoration of Jesus from eleven to midnight here in the house. I instead, have done it close to the suffering Jesus in the person of Fr. Del Greco. (I have really done it with this intention). Now he seems to feel better, let's hope for the best!\\" (19) The assisted camillian priest, who had been operated for a cancer in his throat, completed later what D'Onofrio did not write in his Spiritual Notes: \\"I was almost dying, and the cleric D'Onofrio assisted me and comforted me saying: 'Father, unite your pains to the suffering of Jesus in agony. Today is Good Friday, a beautiful day for you, who are suffering together with Jesus!\\" I have never forgotten those words suggested to me by our cleric, with so much lovableness and faith.\\"(20) ...AND FOR IMMACULATE MOTHER MARY Along with his devotion to Crucified Jesus, Nicolino had a tender and really filial relationship with his Mother, the Immaculate Virgin Mary. In his Writings, and on the death bed, he had sweet and tender expressions for Her, that we must contemplated within the realm of a inner and secret relationship of the soul, deserving of respect and great consideration. Exactly as we do, when contemplating similar relationships of the Saints proposed by the Church as life models. This is an extract from his writings: \\"I'm tired, I would say almost discouraged...I find life in the novitiate hard...Why?... It is the deadly enemy of my soul who overworks me, it is the Lord who purifies me...When will this place of exile come to end?... Ah, difficult world!... I would like to die soon, if it is pleasing to God, to fly in my Mothers' arms. I want to go to rest in Heaven...yes...sweet Mum...But here, serenity comes back slowly into my soul, so I can aim further...This is God's will... \\"Tota vita Christi crux fuit et martyrium\\"...and so, what do I pretend?... To live like a lord? No, no, no. But everything for you, Jesus, Mary!\\"(21) ...ON THE \\"LITTLE WAY\\" OF ST. THERESA One of the intermediate life models that guided his way to the Lord was St. Theresa of the Holy Child and of the Holy Face. Her \\"little way\\" became the code of behavior for his life. In a letter to his mother, who might have been worried about eventual penances imposed by the religious life, Nicolino, wrote reassuring her about the normality and simplicity of the daily acts: \\"...All is done for the Lord, for his love. There are no extraordinary things to do, like exceptional penances, or sleeping on the ground...Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus, a Carmelite French nun, did nothing special during her life, she did nothing unique, she only did her duty; at the age of 24 she died of tuberculosis and became a saint....\\" (22) We have a Prayer written by Nicolino, which comes from a mystic soul. We are not sure whether it belongs to St. Theresa. We present here a little extract which can largely explain our thesis: \\"Give me the suffering, give me the martyrdom of love, only and always what is more pleasing to you, to possess you forever completely ...I am in love with Christ Crucified. Far from me every other joy, every other liking that is not for my beloved Crucified Bridegroom. I desperately want to own your torn Heart completely, to be inside it, incarnated into one reality: I want to renounce myself completely, to completely be You, my Love. I want to renounce myself always, even in the most hard way, not me anymore, but You, You, Crucified Love.\\"(23) At the foot of the page Nicolino annotated: \\"I will recite this prayer at least three times every day: if it is possible, in the morning, at midday and in the evening, before going to bed.\\" He collected every published work of St.Theresa, asking directly from the Convent of Lisieux the last editions. He knew very well the French language and started to translate her poems. To complete these few considerations, we would like to quote stanzas from \\"To Live for Love,\\" which reveal to us his inner tension to conform himself completely to His beloved Crucified Jesus: \\"...Living for love on this Earth does not mean/ to pitch a tent on the top of Tabor. / It means climbing Calvary together with Jesus. / It means considering the cross as a treasure! / In Heaven, I will live of joy. / Then, the affliction will have disappeared forever, / but here, in suffering, / I want to live for love!...To die for love is too sweet a martyrdom, / and that's what I'd like to suffer. / Oh Cherubim! light the lyres, / because I feel it, my exile is close to end.../ Arrow of fire consume me restlessly, / tear my heart in this sad sojourn. / Divine Jesus, please realize my dream: to die for love!\\"(24) This is the secret of the great emotion, esteem and enthusiasm caused by his tragic last year of life and by his passage to Heaven. Everyone could basically feel the spiritual dimension in which he was absorbed, and which is faithfully synthesized in the following passage of the last letter he wrote to his parents: \\"I'm really glad to have the possibility of suffering a little bit now that I'm young, because these are the most beautiful years to offer (something) to the Lord. St. Theresa of Lisieux is the saint that I like most, because she is very similar to me. She too fell sick when she was only about twenty years old, she suffered a lot and died at the age of 24...Dearest parents, you too pray that the Lord may help me to recover the strength, so that I may become a priest and work a lot more for the souls. But if the good Lord wants something different from you and me, may God be blessed, because He knows what he does and what is really good for us. There is no way, we can't know those things...Only God knows...\\"(25) SOME TESTIMONIES Everyone who was able to read the signs of his behavior during the time of the extreme test of his life understood his Message. The demonstrations of esteem expressed at the moment of his death, which as we said were concretized in an extraordinary wave of affective and religious feelings, went beyond the realm of the Camillian Community and time. We are not going to expound the proof of what Nicolino left to us in writing with our own words, rather we shall use a short selection from what the Testimonies have written for the General Postulation of the Order of St. Camilles. ...MILITIAMAN OF THE IMMACULATE: With these words the review of the Militia of the Immaculate presented him to the readers: \\"He has reached the third grade of the M.I.: the one of the total donation: to give himself completely to Mary, accepting every suffering with spirit of faith and generosity in order to conform himself to the Mystery of the Passion and Death of Jesus Christ, to the point of martyrdom. Nicolino, consumed by pain, offered himself as a victim for so many brothers and sisters in need of hope and spiritual salvation. Even though the circumstances and the mode were different, we can compare his offering to that of Father Kolbe, who found in the Immaculate Mother the strength and love to give himself completely, not only for the father of a family, but for all the human kind. The death of the young camillian and the martyrdom of Father Kolbe find their explanation and message in the eternal Word of the Gospel... Nicolino, so young but yet so wise, understood very well what Father Kolbe says in one of his writing: \\"There's only one life to live, not two. We have to become saints completely, not half-way, for the greater glory of the Immaculate, and through her, for the greater glory of God.\\"(26) ...REDEMPTIVE SUFFERING \\"He saw God's plan in everything, directed to Him all his action and accepted with joy the pains and suffering. He used to say to me: \\"Suffering is the best currency with which we can buy Heaven.\\" His death was peaceful and I had the grace to be present at this moment. The following months his illness started to become more and more serious and he was evidently suffering, but with great dignity. He intensively prayed for the sinners and considered the Passion of Jesus and the suffering of St Theresa of Lisieux as models to be imitated, almost literally... During his illness he, like Christ, was able to face the stages of the long Calvary, walking with joy towards the Father, in the Kingdom promised to the good and faithful servants. \\"During that night I was assisting Nicola D'Onofrio and I was woken up at dawn by his troubled screams. I run into his small room; leaning on his elbows, as the strength permitted him, he asked God in a loud voice to be healed: \\"I'll become a priest... I will save many souls...I pray You my Lord, heal me...Mother Mary, please intercede...St.Camilles...! Please father; help me...let us pray together, I have to obtain this miracle... I have to get well...!\\" I raised him and helped him until, shortly after, he became calm, exhausted. Then, speaking softly and full of submissive abandonment, he said: \\"Well...but if it's not possible...let it be as you will my God!\\" This is the gist of his words, even though I may not remember them literally. I was very impressed by that submission to God, that extreme acceptance, so much that it was impossible for me not to compare it with that of Christ on the Cross, who asks imploring and ends with a wonderful submission to His Father's Will.The Doctors in charge almost immediately decided for a surgical operation. Always docile and obedient as usual, he accepted in a spirit of deep union with the Suffering Christ, following the example of St.Theresa of Lisieux in the last period of her illness, and accepted to subject himself to such a delicate operation...But he accepted everything without reacting, and submissively let himself be gradually laid and nailed on his Cross...He spent the Easter period in a special, deep recollection and meditation on the Passion of the Lord, endeavoring to conform himself as much as possible to Him. In fact, he had no doubt anymore about the nature of his illness, he felt it stronger everyday, expanding in his body. Even the easiest things were becoming difficult for him, because he increasingly breathed with difficulty. Though every possible means and cure were attempted in order to sustain him and stimulate his appetite, he kept on losing weight day by day.\\" \\"But it was pleasing to Jesus, the Eternal Priest, to shorten his time of waiting, and he took him soon to the top of Calvary, where Nicolino, became an holocaust for everyone, offered himself to God with heroism as a victim of Love, after the example of St.Theresa of Lisieux, who wanted him as her guest in her city, in France, just before his passage from earth to the realm of the blessed, passing through the narrow door indicated by Jesus for the elected few.\\" \\"I saw him again on his death-bed. His face impressed me. A gaunt, serious and pallid face. His passage must have been a real martyrdom. His last hour absorbed in darkness. Nicolino had tasted the bitterness of Jesus' Cup. And he still had on his face the sign of disgust for the bitterness. I remember now, the physiognomy of the Suffering Servant of Isaiah: \\"He has no appearance or beauty / to attract our eyes / no splendor to delight us\\" (Is. 54, 2). So, like Jesus, Nicolino was \\"eliminated from the land of the living.\\"(Is 54,8). We conclude with the expression used by his mother's friend, who lived for many years in Rome and assisted the young camillian student throughout all his suffering. Simple soul, who after so many years remembers those moments in this way: \\"He seemed to me like Jesus Christ on the Cross, so calm and confident, with prayers on his lips, calling Our Lady 'Mum'. Then, he reclined the head on the left, his tongue moved a little, and he died so peacefully. The Doctor verified the fact, then opened the door and called the mother: \\"Lady, here is your son!\\" As if she was Our Lady receiving Her Crucified Son. The mother fell on her son, then knelt down crying loudly, loudly...\\" ...HIS MESSAGE The title of the small and successful biography written some months after his death, \\"When Love Prays\\", (27) was the incipit of one of the reflections that Nicola D'Onofrio used to jot down on paper in order to be able to follow them for a long time. It was lost. But his teacher in the major Seminary, who had seen it, attests that: \\"the concept, expressed in four short verses, was connected to the words of St Augustine: \\"Love and do what you like.\\" Actually it affirmed that, when love resembles the Love of God, through prayer and service to Him, then it is possible to walk confidently towards the goal.\\" When the Lord called him to live like St. Paul: \\"I complete in my flesh what is missing in the suffering of Christ, for his body, which is the Church.\\"(Col. 1, 24), Nicola D'Onofrio did not draw back. Strongly united to the Mother of God, he lived with coherence the phrase he wrote on a quiet evening in the Novitiate, \\"Tota vita Christi crux fuit et martyrium,\\" adhering to it strongly with \\"All for you, Jesus, Mary\\". The \\"new maternity\\" that the Virgin Mary received from Her Son dying on the Cross, \\"spiritual and universal to all the human kind, so that everyone, in the pilgrimage of faith, could remain strongly united to Her up to the Cross, and, for the strength of this Cross, every suffering, regenerated, could from weakness of man become power of God\\" (28), found its complete realization in Nicola D'Onofrio, and remains a wonderful example for ages. The young camillian student, having gone with joy and serenity through the mystery of human suffering, elevated by Christ to the level of redemption (29), was and remains a credible testimony of the fact that the choice to live the Gospel Values reveals \\"the heavenly treasures already present in this world, shows better the new and eternal life acquired from the Redemption of Christ, and preannounce as well the future Resurrection and the Glory of the Heavenly Kingdom.\\" (30) Young people who get to know his short experience on earth are fascinated by it. Of these, we remember Marie- Louise, a girl who, wanting to follow the invitation of John Paul II, at Compostela: \\"N'ayez pas peur de devenir saints! - Don't be afraid to become saints!\\" wrote to us saying that she has decided to take \\" Nicolas D'Onofrio as a life model...I was looking for a contemporary model of life, and I found in the life of this young boy the plans that I've decided to follow, a few moments ago.\\" (31) For years now, Marie-Louise has dedicated her life to one of the new institutes of consecrated life in the world, serving God through the service to the sick and poor brothers and sisters. Miracles attributed by the intercession of Servant of God, Nicola d'Onofrio Maria Mercedes Correa Maldonado, a 23-year-old Chilean woman who in explicably \\"woke up\\" from cerebral palsy when she was 18, is now pregnant, in what could be the second miracle attributed to Italian seminarian Nicola D'Onofrio (1943‚Äì1964), whose cause of beatification is open in the Diocese of Rome. Maria Mercedes suffered from grave cerebral palsy but on a March afternoon in 2003, after her mother had incessantly prayed to the Italian seminarian for his intercession, she woke up in her hospital bed in Puataendo, sat up and said, \\"I'm hungry.\\" Inexplicable from a medical point of view, the case drew the attention of the Sons of St. Camillus, who are following D'Onofrio's beatification process in Rome, which began in 2000. Now, five years after her miraculous recovery, Maria Mercedes says she is experiencing a new miracle from D'Onofrio, as she has become pregnant despite doctors' diagnoses that it would be impossible. \\"All the specialists who examined her came to the conclusion that she could never have any children. But now she is pregnant. It is a new miracle,\\" her mother said. \\"I realized she could be pregnant; I took her to the doctor and tests confirmed it. For me, this is the second miracle by Nicola, a way of closing Maria Mercedes' cycle of recovery,\\" she told the Chilean daily \\"El Mercurio.\\" \\"I feel good and I'm happy about this new stage in my life and happy to know that my son is going to be born healthy. I'm a little bit afraid to go back to the hospital even though I spent eighteen years there,\\" Maria Mercedes told \\"El Mercurio.\\" A married couple in Texas was told that the birth of a child would be ‚Äùimprobable‚Äù after 7 years of trying. Within a week of praying to D‚ÄôOnofrio, the wife was pregnant; and 9 months later gave birth to a boy who was named Nicola after the Italian seminarian. Prayer for the beatification of the Servant of God, Nicola D'Onofrio Good and merciful God, who hast called Thy servant Nicola D'Onofrio to follow Jesus Christ by offering the riches of his young spirit and his burning heart in the service of Thy Son in the person of the sick: Glorify Thy faithful servant and grant that the young people of our days recognize in him a model of life in the way of love and sacrifice, to bring all souls to Thee, who reignst and livest with the Son and the Holy Spirit in the hearts of Thy children. Amen.

It follows the protagonist of the game, Gordon Freeman, also voiced by Scott, who acts as a combination of narrator and running commentary, often criticizing and satirizing the game world's conventions in a style similar to that in Mystery Science Theater 3000. The series ran from 2007 to 2014 and consists of 71 episodes (including episode 0 and two bonus episodes). A sequel series, titled Freeman's Mind 2, debuted in 2017, and is ongoing. Character differences While the character profile behind the character Gordon Freeman remains mostly the same, he takes on a vastly different personality from the \\"blank slate\\" silent protagonist of the original plot. In Freeman's Mind, Gordon is portrayed as an extremely neurotic, selfish, egocentric individual with a history of drug abuse and racketeering, among other juvenile offenses. Gordon's thoughts often consist of his superiority to his colleagues, critiques of the Black Mesa complex, and a fascination with guns. Most of the characters in the series are the same as in the gamevaguely helpful but more often than not telling Gordon what they need him to do. Since Gordon is still perceived as a silent protagonist by the game's non-player characters, virtually every one of them that he interacts with do not react to his inner dialogue. He has a tendency to berate the NPCs for perceived offenses against him, as well as verbally assaulting the intelligence of the soldiers and aliens he meets along the way. Ross Scott describes Gordon's personality as having \\"shifting paranoia, egomania, mild schizophrenia, over-aggressiveness, petty motivations, and immaturity in general\\", and that \\"the only hint I thought they gave to his personality was how proficient he immediately was in weaponry for being a physicist.\\" From the start, Gordon is shown to have a questionable moral compass that impacts his responses to his environment. For example, in the first episode after a security guard mentions that he is running late, Gordon comments: \\"If I'm fired I could probably jack some office supplies or computer equipment on the way out.\\" Later on in the series, Gordon attempts to rationalize his increasing body count of HECU marines, but eventually drops the pursuit, because \\"no one's going to believe a few dozen counts of self- defense with a submachine gun.\\" Filming techniques Structurally, Freeman's Mind is filmed from the first person perspective of Gordon Freeman. All of the visuals and most of the animations come from the original game, however, many scenes of the series are manipulated through the use of cheats or modifications to the game's engine. Often in the series, Gordon avoids places where the player is usually forced to go. For example, Gordon performs pull- ups throughout the series to navigate to otherwise inaccessible areas. A typical way to film this is through the use of the noclip mode.

It was discovered by David Bayford in 1761 and first reported in a paper by the same in 1787. Pathophysiology During development of aortic arch, if the proximal portion of the right fourth arch disappears instead of distal portion, the right subclavian artery will arise as the last branch of aortic arch. It then courses behind the esophagus (or rarely in front of esophagus, or even in front of trachea) to supply blood to right arm. This causes pressure on esophagus and results in dysphagia.

Jackson, and a full-length figure of his wife. The last was shown at the academy exhibition of 1882 and the international exposition at Munich in 1883. Friedrich Pecht, in his Modern Art at the International Exhibition, says of it: \\"The most skillful of all these ladies' portraits is the one in full figure by Carl L. Brandt, in fact, a most charming picture, a masterpiece good enough for a Netcher.\\" Brandt did some work as a sculptor, and in 1886 had nearly completed a colossal bust of Alexander von Humboldt. Brandt died at Savannah in 1905.

History  Tatars among other nations are native population of multinational region of Central Eurasia, especially its steppes ‚Äì modern territories of Russian Federation, Ukraine, Kazakhstan. During the second half of 19th century Volga Tatars from central Russia, as citizens of Russian empire, in great number moved to the Donbas area of southern Ukraine to work at mines and factories. The number of Volga Tatars at the Luhansk region grew up to about 400,000. Tatars had their own mosques and schools. During Soviet era, authorities closed almost all of them, so people had no place to gather, to pray and to listen about God during that period. Great changes in social life of Central Eurasia and Eastern Europe in the 1980s‚Äì1990s ‚Äì decay of Soviet Union, independence of Ukraine led also to revival of religious, cultural and social life of different communities (among them Tatar communities of Ukraine) and society in whole. After great period of religious intolerance in central Eurasia it became possible to build and open new mosques and other religious and cultural establishments and buildings. Luhansk Cathedral mosque was built by the Muslim community (mostly Tatars) of the Luhansk region. It was officially opened on 29 May 2010. The mosque building is a two-storied construction with an area of 550 square meters. In a basement floor there is a sports hall and a kitchen.

Its offices are in Brussels, Belgium. IMPALA's main mission is to grow the independent music sector, along with promotion of cultural diversity, and improving the perceptions of the industry. IMPALA is a member of the Worldwide Independent Network (WIN), a coalition of independent music bodies from countries throughout the world. History IMPALA was founded in 2000 by national trade associations and key independent labels, as a non-profit organisation dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises in the music industry. In 2008 an Action Plan for Music was launched and in 2010 an Action Plan for Finance was published. In January 2015, IMPALA launched its Digital Action Plan, a ten-point plan calling for a new European industrial policy to drive the digital market through the cultural and creative sectors. The action plan calls on the EU to reinforce copyright, and other key measures, including promoting diversity in a measurable way and devising a new regulatory, competition, social and fiscal framework for smaller actors. To celebrate IMPALA's 15th anniversary, from September 2015 various initiatives took place across Europe under the \\"IMPALA 15\\" banner, such as the Reeperbahn Festival at Hamburg, Germany. In March 2016, IMPALA launched a monthly feature to put the spotlight on Europe's most inspiring young independent labels, known as the Young Label Spotlight. On 24 September 2018, Paul Pacifico, CEO of the UK's Association of Independent Music and Michel Lambot, co-founder and Co- President of the PIAS Group, co-represented IMPALA, the body representing European indie record labels, at the expert workshop organised by the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels (BOZAR), the European Cultural Foundation and the British Council about Brexit and the cultural sector. The goal was \\"to reaffirm our shared intent and common values, and to produce practical recommendations from the cultural and creative sectors that go beyond those that have already been made\\", and a list of recommendations was afterwards published on the IMPALA website. As part of its role of representing independent music companies at EU level, IMPALA was involved in the discussions on the EU copyright directive, and is working on competition issues such as Sony's buyout of EMI in 2018, or more recently the sale of Universal Music Group's shares. Members IMPALA has almost 5000 members, including national associations as well independent music companies as direct members.

Overview  The system anatomy was first used in a project at Ericsson, and Jack J√§rkvik is considered the inventor of the concept. After that, the system anatomy and the similar project anatomy (also integration anatomies) have been used widely in different Ericsson projects and now they are being spread to other major companies with complex system development as well. Anatomies can be said to be a human centric way of describing a system, since they are used as a means to obtain a common view of the system under development. The anatomies are especially useful in development of large complex systems in incremental and integration driven development, and as a means to coordinate agile development teams. Advantages and limitations The system anatomy, unlike its siblings (project anatomy, integration anatomy), is actually just another view of the system, different from product structure modeling, UML diagrams and flowcharts. By focusing on the system's capabilities ‚Äì both internal and money making ones ‚Äì and the dependencies between those, the development team gets a common picture of the system to be developed, that is easier to grasp than many other models. One of the key features of the system anatomy is its simplicity. That, of course, means that the anatomy cannot replace other models or design tools. It is only another way of describing the design, in SW tools, on paper or in the heads of the system engineers. The system anatomy can be used as a starting point when creating an integration anatomy (aka project anatomy) that has more use as a project management tool.  Example  The following example is a simplified example of a system anatomy for an issue management system. This anatomy is drawn with the most basic capabilities at the top. The notation is that the capability at the end of the arrow is a dependent of the capability at the beginning. In this example the anatomy also shows development progress (blue boxes).

It is mainly used in incremental development and Integration Driven Development projects.  Overview  The project anatomy has evolved from the system anatomy and in its purest form the work items (called work packages) reflect the development of system capabilities. Often a more pragmatic approach is taken, though, where work packages may contain other items with important dependencies as well, e.g. HW deliveries for embedded systems. = Benefits = Simple * Easy to grasp view of what to do, what is done and the dependencies between work packages * Collaborative * Common view for developers, project managers and sponsors * Helps in finding and managing risks and delays * Can be used to manage dependencies between teams and sprints in large agile development projects = Limitations = Can include, but not manage, lead time aspects * Can include, but not manage, resource aspects  History  Project anatomies evolved from system anatomies at Ericsson since the late 1990s. Both the terminology and the methodology have differed between organizations and the difference between \\"system anatomy\\", \\"project anatomy\\", \\"delta anatomy\\" and \\"integration anatomy\\" is sometimes diffuse or non-existent. In 2004 FindOut Technologies presented a SW tool (Paipe) for managing anatomies with more properties. The company has, since then, worked to establish the term Project Anatomy.  Example  The project anatomy below is an example showing the work packages needed to develop a simple issue management system. Work packages with many dependencies are called spiders and indicate a risk. The risk may be managed by splitting the work package or by moving dependants of it to later shipments (increments). The colors indicate the current status of work packages, where green means \\"on track\\", yellow means \\"at risk\\" and red means \\"off track\\". Blue work packages are done.

Life and career Jean Cousin served with Johannes Ockeghem and eleven other singers in the chapel of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon from 1446 to 1448 at his chapel in Moulins. Between 1448 and 1461, Cousin was employed in the orchestra at the French court, and perhaps as early as 1452, as Ockeghem at this time became an employee of the French king. It was not until 1461, however, that Cousin is recorded as a member of the court orchestra. At the funeral of Charles VII, he was given a robe. King Louis XI asked the Pope for Ockeghem, Cousin and other members of the royal chapel to receive three benefices, which the Pope provided in his Bull of December 5, 1463. Until at least 1474, Cousin served as a singer and priest of the French king, and by 1473 he had reached third place in the hierarchy of the orchestra. It is unclear when his employment was ended due to loss of the court orchestra bills for the period after 1474. Cousin was recorded as taking part in the Tours city election assemblies in 1463-1464.

This heritage includes the traditions which dominate in contemporary political discourse; it combines conservatism and liberalism with the Christian vision of Western identity and the republican ethos of civic participation. It derives its political, institutional, and legal conceptions from the analyses of particular social relations and avoids constructing any abstract, a priori models of public life. It perceives the fundamental values of our time, such as liberty, equality, democracy, the rule of law, efficient public policy, civil society, and self-government as remaining far from any harmony and coherence. In fact, this heritage leaves much room for axiological skepticism, inspires a movement of ideas, and requires cognitive obiectivism.

It is a remake of the \\"Dreamhouse\\" episode from the film anthology Screamtime.\\"PSYCHOSIS\\" (DVD REVIEW) Fangoria The film was released in the United Kingdom in July 2010 and 11 January 2011 in the United States. The film was budgeted at $1 million.  Plot  In 1992, a group of young Anarchists seeking to preserve local wildlife are brutally murdered. The killer is later found collapsed by a river due to wounds he had sustained while attempting to kill a lone surviving anarchist. The movie flashes forward 15 years to 2007, as successful crime novelist Susan moves into a nearby house with her husband David, who purchased it in hopes of helping her with her writing. Susan is quickly made uneasy as she witnesses the house's gamekeeper, Peck, having enthusiastic sex in the woods and later exposing himself to her. She also begins to witness strange visions in the house, all surrounding bloody bodies, the killer from earlier in the film, and people who appear one moment and disappear the next. It is later revealed that Susan had previously suffered a mental breakdown due to seeing and hearing things that were never there, which was part of the reason for the house's purchase. After David leaves for a \\"business trip\\" (quickly revealed to be an excuse to indulge in incredibly raunchy affairs), Susan is drugged and taken advantage of sexually by Peck. The next day, Susan confides in a local priest about her past mental illnesses and her fears of her new home. The priest has a psychic examine the house, only for him to declare that there are no presences currently in the house. Immediately after they are escorted outside by her husband, Susan witnesses a series of brutal murders involving all of the people she had earlier seen in her visions. The vision end up destroying what little sanity Susan has left, resulting in her accidentally killing Peck as he was checking up on her. Upon discovering what she has done, Susan is sent to a mental institution. The movie then shows that Susan had been channeling her visions into her latest book, which has become an instant bestseller. David is shown receiving money for the book and it is implied that he had married her only for her money, and that Peck's actions were done in an attempt to get blackmail material for a divorce. David then goes back to the house one last time to finalize the sale to a new owner, where we are an shown all of the people Susan had seen during her visions. He is then gruesomely murdered by the killer Susan had been seeing all along (who had survived, been incarcerated, and escaped), revealing that her visions had never been due to insanity, and were predictions of the future murders that would happen in the house.

Biography  ‚ÄòHe always lived in an inverted world, through the looking glass, a world with its own laws, its own sky, its own land. He was and remains the Don Quixote of the Soviet era.‚Äô (Mikhail Roginsky) Pavel Leonov had many lives: village librarian, cart- horse driver, miner, tin-smith, plasterer, factory worker, sign painter. Alongside these varied occupations he had one constant dream‚Ä¶to be an artist. Born in 1920 in the village of Volotovskoye in the Orel region, Leonov‚Äôs life mirrored many of the convulsions of the communist era. Escaping from a tyrannical father who Leonov described as \\"a professional alcoholic\\", he left his village at the age of eighteen with five roubles in his pocket and a ticket for the train to Orel. His objective was nothing less than to participate in the building of a new society. In 1938 he was arrested for the first time. Many of Leonov‚Äôs large repertoire of skills were acquired as a prisoner of the Gulag system. As a boy Leonov taught himself to draw from a manual. In the early 1960s he attended the People‚Äôs Free University in Moscow (ZNUI). There he received encouragement from the artist Mikhail Roginsky. By 1970 Leonov‚Äôs work had received serious critical attention and in the 1980s he was included in ‚ÄòThe World Encyclopaedia of Na√Øve Art‚Äô. However, it was at this time that he also disappeared. It was not until 1990, after almost twenty years, that he was discovered living in extreme poverty in Mekhovitzi, a village in the Ivanovo region, sharing a one-room shack with his wife and teenage son. Unable to sell his paintings he had glued them to the walls as extra insulation against the severe winters. With the encouragement, among others, of Moscow-based art historians Olga Diakonitsina and Ksenia Bogemskaia, Leonov‚Äôs fortunes changed. Russian institutions like The Pushkin Museum, The Moscow Museum of Outsider Art and The Moscow Museum of Na√Øve Art embraced Leonov as a unique visionary artist. His work was lauded internationally, receiving the Grand Prix at INSITA in 1997. Despite his change in fortunes, his living conditions remained basic. Leonov cared little about his physical circumstances. The astonishing beauty of his work was the opposite of the life, what mattered to him was the creation and distribution of his ‚Äòinventions‚Äô, as he called his paintings. Still invigorated by the ideals of his youth, Leonov worked at a furious pace during the 1990s, concentrating a lifetime‚Äôs insight into a decade of phenomenal productivity. In his remote village materials were hard to come by: his canvases were sometimes sackcloth, table linen or old curtains; his paints were often cheap house paint; when his brushes wore out he would resort to sticks and bristles. Aware of but far from the social and economic anarchy of the post-Perestroika period, Leonov found the space, physically and spiritually, to construct his diagrams for a better society. As arthritis gripped his hands his work began to take on a monumental scale, echoing the Soviet murals he had seen on his travels. Figures were superimposed on carpet-like backgrounds, featuring cells of idealised activity where nature and man worked in harmony together. Friends and visitors became incorporated into his work, their faces generalised, all imbued with an inner vitality. \\"I want to show people as the best they can be,\\" he said.

They were part of an opposition that included politicians, labor leaders and immigrant groups. Membership was open to anyone who opposed the KKK and was \\"not a Protestant\\". They had significant support amongst various ethnic groups in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Bryce Bauer has written that, \\"Instead of only admitting white, native-born Protestants as the Klan did, the organization vowed to accept anyone who was anything other than that.\\" They were one of a number of national organizations in the USA organized in the 1920s in opposition to the growing influence of the KKK. Notable outbreaks of violence took place in the Mahoning Valley of Ohio and in \\"Bloody Williamson\\" county of Southern Illinois.  Prohibition Era  During the early to mid 1920s the Klan primarily targeted Catholics and immigrants instead of blacks. They supported the Volstead Act during the era of Prohibition, and were willing to enforce the liquor laws through vigilantism. They blamed Catholics for bootlegging, and informed on moonshiners to local law enforcement. They blamed the lack of enforcement of the Volstead Act on corrupt law enforcement. One Klan member wrote the following, referring to Catholics as fish eaters (a derogatory reference to the Catholic practice of eating fish on Fridays): \\"We have a Klan Sheriff but our prosecuting attorney is a fish eater and will do anything he can to fish the Klan\\". At times, the Klan burned crosses in front of Catholic homes. The name \\"Knights of the Flaming Circle\\" refers to the Klan's burning cross. In 1923, the same year that the organization was founded, the editors of Catholic World wrote that Catholic citizens would act against the Klan in \\"self- defense, even to the extent of bloodshed.\\" In some parts of the country, Catholic members of the Red Knights responded with \\"mass, armed counterattacks\\" significant enough for the National Guard to be called during at least one of these actions. = Ohio = On Aug. 15, 1923, a Klan motorcade from East Liverpool, Ohio, and Chester, West Virginia, came downriver to Steubenville, Ohio where they met at a hotel for dinner. The opponents of the Klan, members of the local Flaming Circle, gathered outside the hotel. Six or seven cars were overturned and the Klansmen were attacked with bricks, bottles and clubs. Reports noted between 2,500 and 3,000 people participated in the melee. Although many injuries were reported, no deaths seemed to have taken place.Jim Joyce.

Violence prevented a second parade from taking place the next month in June. The Klan rescheduled for November 1, 1924, and the Knights of the Flaming Circle announced plans for a competing counter-march, promising 10,000 participants. On October 29, someone bombed the home of the city's mayor because he refused to revoke the parade permit. Tensions escalated and resulted in 18 hours of full-blown rioting ended only with 10 days of martial law.November 1, 1924. \\"Ohio City In Terror, Fearing Klan March.\\" The New York Times. 17; \\"About Niles, Ohio.\\" City of Niles website. http://www.thecityofniles.com/about.htm ; and William D.

He was one of the founding members of the Exat 51 group whose active members between 1950 and 1956 were the architects Bernardo Bernardi, Zdravko Bregovac, Bo≈æidar Ra≈°ica and Vladimir Zaharoviƒá, and the painters Vlado Kristl, Ivan Picelj and Aleksandar Srnec. He was also a member of the New Tendencies movement (from 1961). He designed exhibition pavilions (Bruxelles 1958, Turin and Milan), several museum buildings, and was involved in industrial and interior design. From 1962 he began to explore the medium of sculpture, which resulted in the Reliefmeter series among many other works of art. In 1955, Vjenceslav Richter organized the first Zagreb Triennial, an art and design festival that sought to bring together a wide range of design disciplines, including applied arts, industrial design, and fine arts. The second triennial was not held until four years later, and was equally unsuccessful in its aim of popularising modernist design. He exhibited at many shows in Croatia and abroad, including: the Museum of Arts and Crafts, Zagreb, (1964), Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, (1968), Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb, (1968), Staempfly Gallery, New York, (1968), Galerie Semiha Huber, Zurich, (1969), at the Venice Biennale (1972), Gallery 58, Rapperswill, (1972), Galleria del Naviglio, Milan, (1973), Galleria all Centro, Napoli, (1973), Galleria Visconti, Milan, (1976) and Galleria La Loggia, Udine, (1977). He won many awards, including the City of Zagreb Award (1959), the Golden Medal at the 13th Triennial in Milan (1964), the 11th S√£o Paulo Biennale Award for Sculpture (1971), and the Herder Prize (1981). He received two life achievement awards: the Viktor Kovaƒçiƒá Award (1988) and the Vladimir Nazor Award (1993).

Delehaye, Propylaeum ad Acta sanctorum Nouembris, col. 591, c.f 783 f. This connection is disputed, as Christian tradition holds that Agabus was martyred at Jerusalem, and not at Antioch as Muslims believe of Habib.Encyclopedia of Islam, Habib Al-Nadjdjar: \\"...it is not stated that this was at Antioch, but either at Jerusalem or in some place not specified...\\" All Muslim sources list Habib's occupation as a carpenter.Almost all sources, including al-Masudi, Mutahhar, Balami and al-'Thalabi apply Habib's occupation as a carpenter Historical narrative Although Habib is not mentioned in the Qur'an, an old Muslim tradition speaks of some of Christ's disciples, including John, Jude and Peter, who were sent to town of Antioch to preach the faith of God.Muhammad, Martin Lings, Chapter XXVIII The people of Antioch had regressed to idolatry. When the disciples came, many of the people questioned them, asking them of what religion Jesus had sent them to preach.Hughes Dictionary of Islam, Habib the Carpenter Baidawi provided a detailed account of Habib's narrative. He related that the disciples met Habib in Antioch and made known to him their mission. Baidawi further related that the disciples, by the will of God, performed various miracles including healing the sick and blind. After Habib's son was healed, Habib's faith was further strengthened and he tried to help in preaching the Gospel to his fellow people. Yet still, many refused to hear God's message. Instead, the disbelievers decided to stone Habib to death. The legend ends with Habib, upon having been stoned, entering paradise as a martyr.Hughes Dictionary of Islam, Habib the Carpenter In the Quran The legend of Habib the martyr was, by early Quran commentators, identified with the following verse of the Quran: The people who are described as preaching to the town in the Qur'anic verse are mentioned as 'messengers'. Therefore, the identification of Christ's disciples and Habib with the figures in the Qur'anic verse is believed to be false by many modern commentators. This is because the term 'Messenger' or 'Apostle' usually denotes a Prophet in the Qur'an, unlike the New Testament which describes some disciples of Jesus as apostles. Many people translates Rasulullah as 'Apostle of God'.

World War I Day was the son of William John and Elizabeth Day, of Wernddu, Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. He joined the RNAS as a probationary temporary flight officer, and was commissioned as a temporary flight sub-lieutenant on 30 June 1917. He first served in No. 10 Naval Squadron, flying a Sopwith Triplane. He scored his first aerial victory with them, sending an Albatros D.V down out of control on 12 August 1917. He was then posted to No. 8 Naval Squadron and flew the Sopwith Camel for his remaining ten victories. During December 1917, he teamed with Guy William Price to drive down DFW two-seater reconnaissance aircraft on three different days. Fighting solo, Day destroyed one enemy aircraft and drove down three others during January 1918. On 2 February 1918, he joined Robert J. O. Compston and three other RNAS pilots in destroying a German reconnaissance aircraft, and in driving down an Albatros D.V later in the day. On 5 February, he joined three other RNAS pilots in destroying a reconnaissance machine; that brought his total to one enemy aircraft destroyed solo, two more shared, and eight driven down out of control. He then dived on another German aircraft. Day's Camel came to pieces during the dive, plummeting him to his death.Franks (2003), p.23. G√ºnther Schuster of Jasta 29 was credited with the victory.

It is the successor of the Thailand Cricket League, which was formed in 1971 and elected to ICC in 1995. Since 2005, it's one of the associate member of the ICC. The main aims of the organization is to promote and popularize Cricket throughout all the provinces of Thailand and to propagate the ‚ÄúSpirit of Cricket‚Äù. Cricket Association of Thailand operates all of the Thailand's national representative cricket sides, including the Thailand national cricket team, the Thailand national women's cricket team and youth sides as well. CAT is also responsible for organising and hosting the cricket matches of different formats with other nations, and scheduling the home international fixtures. History Cricket was introduced to Thailand by the children of elite Thai families who learnt the game during education in England. They founded the Bangkok City Cricket Club in 1890, and the side played its first game in November of that year at Pramane ground. But cricket has never been a popular sport in Thailand, where other sports like football, Muay Thai, tennis and golf have high visibility. In 1971, after the establishment of Thailand Cricket League, cricket has been organized as competitive sport. The Sports Authority of Thailand renamed the TCL to the Cricket Association of Thailand in 2004. Since then many constructive efforts are made to popularize cricket among the Thai people. The past ten years has seen a heartening growth of the game at grass root level. Bangkok Cricket League The Bangkok Cricket League is a professional league in Bangkok, which has run under the guidance of the Cricket Association of Thailand since 2002. It's the most premier and largest league of Cricket in Thailand which is also officially recognized by the Sports Authority of Thailand.

The water temperature is above average, ranging from 24-29 ¬∞C. Choriaster granulatus has been found individually or in groups in the Indo-West Pacific region along coral reefs. It has also been found in the Red Sea, Fiji, and Great Barrier Reef. The sandy habitat is characterized by rubble slopes and detritus and they have been found among corals and sponges. Choriaster granulatus  Diet  Choriaster granulatus is a carnivore and has its mouth on the underside of its body, like other sea stars. Their prey is absorbed outside their mouths by forcing out their digestive organs from their stomach. Its prey include carrion and small invertebrates such as coral polyps.  Life cycle and reproduction  Embryos hatch into planktonic larvae before becoming juveniles with five arms. These juveniles will grow up to be sea stars with stubby arms. The Asteroidea class of organisms use both asexual and sexual means of reproduction.  Threats  The arms of Choriaster granulatus can become deformed when small parasitic limpets attach to the underside of the arms.

The pottery's distribution is not confined to the Khabur region, but spreads across northern Iraq and is also found at a few sites in Turkey and Iran. Archaeologists associate the pottery with the cuneiform texts dated to the reign of Shamshi-Adad I, although it is not clear how much earlier it was manufactured. Overview =History= Four main Khabur ware phases are established, 1-4. While the starting date for phase 1 is inconclusive, a tentative date of ca. 1900 BC is suggested based on evidence from Tell Brak. The beginning of the second, and the main, phase of Khabur ware is dated to the reign of Shamshi-Adad I (ca. 1813 BC), based on evidence from Chagar Bazar, Tell al-Rimah, Tell Taya and Tell Leilan. The third phase of Khabur ware is dated to ca. 1750, and lasts until ca. 1550. The fourth and last phase, is a period shared between Khabur ware and Nuzi ware, and ends with its disappearance ca. 1400 BC. =Designs= The pottery is wheel-made and decorated with monochrome designs in red, brown or black. The designs found on the pottery are combinations of simple motifs, usually geometric with horizontal bands, triangles and others. Naturalistic designs become more common in its later phases. Its final phase manifests jars with button bases and tall vertical necks, a form characteristic of the painted Nuzi ware, of the Late Bronze Age, which indicates an overlap between the two wares until the disappearance of the Khabur ware.

Released in 2008, it is a concept album about Lammendam, the remains of a castle that are haunted by a \\"ghost lady in a white dress\\". Dennis \\"Seregor\\" Droomers claims that he was inspired to write the album by a local legend that he has been familiar with since childhood. The legend centers around series of events that supposedly occurred in Schinveldse Bossen, a forest area northeast of the Dutch region of South Limburg and of the town of Schinveld, near the German border. In several interviews, Seregor has described the legend as being about a young woman who lived in the castle in the 17th century. This woman was involved in a love triangle between two men; when both of the men found out about each other, several fights broke out. One night, under mysterious circumstances, her castle was burned, leading to the young woman's death, and her ghost remains on the land. Shortly after her death, her two lovers soon also died. According to the legend, her ghost appears in the forest on nights of the full moon wearing a long white dress. The name Lammendam is a Dutch adaptation of the French term \\"La Dame Blanche\\", which translates to \\"The White Lady.\\" This name was given to the ghost that appeared in Schinveldse Bossen by French farmers who had evacuated to the Netherlands during the French revolution. Style The album features symphonic black metal with progressive song structures. The style has been compared to Ninnghizhidda, Anorexia Nervosa, and Dimmu Borgir. A reviewer of Sputnikmusic observed that singer Seregor's vocals were unique since they are \\"relatively easy to understand and decipher upon first listen\\" when compared to other bands in the genre. The lyrics however are not written in the traditional verse-chorus-verse structure of the genre. Critical reception Lammendam received positive reviews that nonetheless marked that the band was still at the beginning of their career. Metal Hammer Germany wrote that an own identity of the band was still needed. The Sonic Seducer magazine praised the technical skills of the band and the diversity of emotion portrayed by the album. Also Sputnikmusic was favorable of the band's instrumental skills.

This album tells the legend of a ghost ship (an interpretation of the Flying Dutchman) from its beginnings. While a wide variety of interpretations of the Flying Dutchman legend exist, the band says that the album is based on the Dutch interpretation of the story. However, they took some creative liberties with it to make it a more horrifying story. The album starts in the future, when a boat with an electronic communication device sails to the sea. The boat picks up signs of an eerie voice cursing its captain's name through the radio. Then a ghost ship comes across the sea. The sailors then remember stories about how people who saw that ship died in horrible ways. In track No. 3, in the same day of the sighting, later that night, the captain is haunted by the ghost of the seas. He kills his wife and daughter while sleepwalking and then kills himself with a shotgun. After that, it begins telling the story of Van der Decken and how he became the captain of an evil ship. Style The album contains symphonic black metal although the vocals are kept clear. Parallels to Dimmu Borgir have been observed in the keyboard lines and the vocals' timbre. The structure of the songs has been described as \\"bulky\\" with many abrupt breaks, which is contrary to traditional black metal structures. Reception Death Came Through a Phantom Ship received positive reviews from Sputnikmusic and the German edition of Metal Hammer. The former observed that the band had even improved their instrumental qualities compared to their debut album Lammendam and recommended the new album for listeners new to the genre. Metal Hammer praised the diversity of the songs but was sceptical of their unusual structure.

The quartet, originally, was the Kortschak String Quartet, named for Hugo Kortschak (1884‚Äì1957), a member of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 1907 until 1914 (serving as assistant concertmaster from 1910 until 1914). Kortschak was a key figure in organizing the Berkshire Chamber Music Festival founded by Coolidge.Kortschak Recital at Cummington, _The Springfield Republican_ , col 6, pg. 6E, August 17, 1941 The original Berkshire String Quartet disbanded sometime after 1941. In July 1948, the successors of the Gordon Quartet were about to disband for a lack of funding and loss of its founder, Jacques Gordon (1897‚Äì1948), who had disbanded the quartet in 1947 due to ill health. Coolidge came to the rescue. She underwrote enough additional performances to make the quartet's summer season possible. But, according to Time magazine, Coolidge, for one of the few times in her life, asked a sentimental favor in return. \\"Would the quartet please call itself the Berkshire Quartet?\\"Music: Patroness, _Time_ , July 12, 1948 The quartet agreed and, at the urging of Wilfred Bain, moved its permanent residence to the Indiana University School of Music.

The Nachrichenregiment 14 (NR-14) ‚ÄûHarro Schulze-Boysen‚Äú was a signal regiment-sized unit of the National People's Army (NVA) Air Forces of the National People's Army of the former East Germany (GDR). The primary task of that unit consisted in the signal support to the Air Force Command (Kdo LSK/LV) as well as of the Main Operation Centre (MOC), the so-called ZGS LSK/LV. Note: In German language the wording Nachrichtenregiment might be ambiguous or misleading and could be mixed up even with intelligence/ signal intelligence. However, this regiment was unequivocal a primary signal unit. In order to avoid misunderstanding and according to NATO terminology signal typical terms will be chosen as far as possible.  History  The NR-14 was established in 1956 as a battalion-sized signal unit (de. Nachrichtenbataillon 2) in Waldsieversdorf (Rotes Luch).NR-14 auf der Homepage des Milit√§rarchivs; eingesehen am 16. Juni 2009 After interim steps in 1960 this battalion was expanded to become the Signal Regiment 19 (NR-19), a regiment-sized unit. In 1967 the name of honour Harro Schulze- Boysen was dedicated to this particular signal regiment. Subsequent to restructuring in 1970 the unit received finally the designation Nachrichtenregiment 14 (NR-14), Harro Schulze-Boysen.  Organization  The NR-14 was direct supported to the NVA Air Force Command (Kdo LSK/LV) with the organization structure as follows: *Signal battalion HQ Kdo LSK/LV (stationary)  Signal Operation‚Äôs Office / COMMCEN Strausberg (Eggersdorf), alternative COMMCEN-22  Radio Relay Axis (RVG-961, stationary) with 10 radio relay sites (in bunkers)  Radio Transmitter Center (stationary) with 4 RX sites  COMMCEN Ranzig / Beeskow, alternative COMMCEN-23 * Signal battalion MOC Kdo LSK/LV (stationary)  COMMCEN F√ºrstenwalde Bunker Fuchsbau, Alternative COMMCEN-21  Transmission Center F√ºrstenwalde 2  Two radio companies, key telegraph, RX center (HF) * Training battalion communications and Air Traffic Control  Two training companies * Radio battalion (deployable) with TX stations HF long distance (stationary) Telephone, teleprinter, switchboard, carrier frequency telephone/voice frequency telegraphy  HF, Aeronautical mobile service  Radio relay stations (deployable, up to 24 standard telephone channels)  Field cable laying equipment (cable: LFL, FFK 36/250, FVK 60)  Special equipment: Battle command center (de: GFZ)  TX site HF (partial stationary) TX Center-2 * Repair and maintenance company  Organization after disbandment of the NVA With the disbandment of the NVA in 1990 the stationary HF transmitter site (Limsdorf) was long-lasting integrated into the organization structure of the German Air Force (GAF). Also some handheld equipment and the so-called aeronautical radio equipment east were integrated to the equipment pool Deployable Air Situation Display and Interface Processor System (DASDIPS). After that the NR-14, meanwhile Fernmeldeabteilung 14 (FmAbt-14), was disbanded April 1, 1993. The Bundswehr site Waldsieversdorf (Rotes Luch) was given up as well. The in-service support management for DASDIPS equipment, in operation at present, is with GAF Weapon Systems Command. The operational responsibility to DASDIPS is with the German Air Force Command. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"right\\" width=\\"285px\\" + Commanding officers -  bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  1956‚Äì1961  bgcolor=\\"#dfefff\\"  LtCol H.

They are evidently the source of the county's name. The group may have been established as early as 577, when the Saxons conquered part of the area from the Britons, but they are not mentioned by name until 845. They may have been related to the obscure Glastening or Glestinga, who may be the source of the name Glastonbury. Name The name Sumors«£te is Old English and may be a shortened form of Sumort≈´ns«£te, meaning \\"the people living at or dependent upon Sumort≈´n\\", i.e. the modern town of Somerton. The origin of Somerton itself is unknown; it may mean 'The sea-lake enclosure' from the Old English sae, mere and tun or possibly \\"summer farmstead\\", from sumer and -t≈´n. The first known use of the name Somers√¶te was in 845, after the region fell to the Saxons. When King Alfred coined the future county motto 'Sumors«£te ' in the ninth century, he referred to the people of Somerset as the Sumort≈´ns«£te. History The Sumoraete may have been related in some way to the obscure Glastening or Glestinga, about whom almost nothing is known, but whose name has been connected to nearby Glastonbury. One of the Harleian genealogies dating to the 10th century begins with a certain \\"Glast\\", who came to \\"Glastening\\" from Luit-Coyt (modern Lichfield in England). This pedigree also appears in later versions, though it is unclear if these version intend a person named \\"Glas\\" or a kindred group. The native Britons of the Southwest at this time spoke a variant of the Common Brittonic language ancestral to Cornish. Anglo-Saxon settlers introduced Old English. The Anglo-Saxons established control over much of what is now England by 600, but were held off at British-held Somerset. However, by the early 8th century King Ine of Wessex had pushed the boundaries of the West Saxon kingdom far enough west to include Somerset. The Saxon royal palace in Cheddar was used several times in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot. The earliest fortification of Taunton started for King Ine of Wessex and √Üthelburg, in or about the year 710 AD. However, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle this was destroyed 12 years later. Somerset, like Dorset to the south, held the West Saxon advance from Wiltshire/Hampshire back for over a century, remaining a frontier between the Saxons and the Romano-British Celts. The Saxons conquered Bath following the Battle of Deorham in 577, and the border was probably established along the line of the Wansdyke to the north of the Mendip Hills. Then Cenwalh of Wessex broke through at Bradford-on-Avon in 652, and the Battle of Peonnum possibly at Penselwood in 658, advancing west through the Polden Hills to the River Parrett.

His first musical experiences were courtesy of his mother, who played piano and sang to him as a child. Later, at George Washington Carver Elementary School, Tillis decided to join the school's drum and bugle corps. As he became more proficient on trumpet, Tillis found his first professional job as a musician in jazz bands when he was twelve years old, earning him the nickname \\"Baby Tillis\\". Tillis' band director at Central Side High School,Central High School, the first black high school in Texas (founded 1885), merged with Ball High School in 1968 Fleming S. Huff, suggested that he start playing the saxophone. =Post- secondary education= In 1946, Tillis was accepted at Wiley College on a music scholarship, and thus became the first person in his family to receive a college education. He graduated from Wiley in 1949 with a B.A. in music, accepting the position of college band director there almost immediately. He also married fellow Wiley music major Louise at this time. They moved from Texas in 1951 so that Tillis could attend the University of Iowa for graduate music studies. At this time, he also decided to volunteer in the United States Air Force at the outbreak of the Korean War, and became director of the 356th Air Force Band. He later went back to get his PhD under the GI Bill at University of North Texas College of Music, but then returned to the University of Iowa to finish his doctoral studies.Aaron Horne, Brass Music of Black Composers: A Bibliography, Greenwood Publishing Group (1996) Career as educator and composer Completing his PhD in 1963, Tillis then held a succession of academic positions at Wiley College, Grambling College, and Kentucky State University.

He retired in 1997, but still held the title of Professor Emeritus in the Department of Music and Dance. Tillis served as Director Emeritus of the University Fine Arts Center and Director of the Jazz in July Workshops in Improvisation at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Tillis wrote music since the age of twenty, and was influenced by Schoenberg, Bach, Prokofiev, Mussorgsky, African-American composers, and world music.

Mathematically, the group SL(2,R) acts on the Heisenberg group by outer automorphisms, and the Schr√∂dinger group is the corresponding semidirect product. Schr√∂dinger algebra The Schr√∂dinger algebra is the Lie algebra of the Schr√∂dinger group. It is not semi-simple. In one space dimension, it can be obtained as a semi-direct sum of the Lie algebra sl(2,R) and the Heisenberg algebra; similar constructions apply to higher spatial dimensions. It contains a Galilei algebra with central extension. :[J_a,J_b]=i \\\\epsilon_{abc} J_c,\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :[J_a,P_b]=i \\\\epsilon_{abc} P_c,\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :[J_a,K_b]=i \\\\epsilon_{abc} K_c,\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :[P_a,P_b]=0, [K_a,K_b]=0, [K_a,P_b]=i \\\\delta_{ab} M,\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :[H,J_a]=0, [H,P_a]=0, [H,K_a]=i P_a.\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Where J_a, P_a, K_a, H are generators of rotations (angular momentum operator), spatial translations (momentum operator), Galilean boosts and time translation (Hamiltonian) correspondingly (Notes: i is the imaginary unit, i^2=-1. The specific form of the commutators of the generators of rotation J_a is the one of three- dimensional space, then a,b,c=1,\\\\ldots,3.). The central extension M has an interpretation as non-relativistic mass and corresponds to the symmetry of Schr√∂dinger equation under phase transformation (and to the conservation of probability). There are two more generators which we shall denote by D and C. They have the following commutation relations: :[H,C]=i D, [C,D]=-2i C, [H,D]=2i H,\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :[P_a,D]=i P_a, [K_i,D]=-iK_a,\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :[P_a,C]=-iK_a,[K_a,C]=0,\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :[J_a,C]=[J_a,D]=0.\\\\,\\\\\\\\! The generators H, C and D form the sl(2,R) algebra. A more systematic notation allows to cast these generators into the four (infinite) families X_n, Y_m^{(j)}, M_n and R_n^{(jk)}=-R_n^{(kj)}, where n ‚àà ‚Ñ§ is an integer and m ‚àà ‚Ñ§+1/2 is a half- integer and j,k=1,...,d label the spatial direction, in d spatial dimensions. The non-vanishing commutators of the Schr√∂dinger algebra become (euclidean form) :[X_n, X_{n'}] = (n-n') X_{n+n'} :[X_n, Y_m^{(j)}] = \\\\left( {n\\\\over 2} -m\\\\right) Y_{n+m}^{(j)} :[X_n, M_{n'}] = -n' M_{n+n'} :[X_n, R_{n'}^{(jk)}] = -n' R_{n'}^{(jk)} :[Y_m^{(j)}, Y_{m'}^{(k)}] = \\\\delta_{j,k} (m-m') M_{m+m'} :[R_n^{(ij)},Y_m^{(k)}] = \\\\delta_{i,k} Y_{n+m}^{(j)} - \\\\delta_{j,k} Y_{n+m}^{(i)} :[R_n^{(ij)},R_{n'}^{(kl)}] = \\\\delta_{i,k} R_{n+n'}^{(jl)} +\\\\delta_{j,l} R_{n+n'}^{(ik)} -\\\\delta_{i,l} R_{n+n'}^{(jk)} -\\\\delta_{j,k} R_{n+n'}^{(il)} The Schr√∂dinger algebra is finite-dimensional and contains the generators X_{-1,0,1}, Y_{-1/2,1/2}^{(j)}, M_0, R_0^{(jk)} . In particular, the three generators X_{-1}=H, X_0=D, X_{1}=C span the sl(2,R) sub-algebra. Space-translations are generated by Y_{-1/2}^{(j)} and the Galilei-transformations by Y_{1/2}^{(j)}. In the chosen notation, one clearly sees that an infinite-dimensional extension exists, which is called the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìVirasoro algebra. Then, the generators X_n with n integer span a loop-Virasoro algebra. An explicit representation as time-space transformations is given by, with n ‚àà ‚Ñ§ and m ‚àà ‚Ñ§+1/2M. Henkel, J. Stat. Phys. 75, 1023 (1994) : X_n = - t^{n+1}\\\\partial_t -{n+1\\\\over 2}t^n\\\\vec{r}\\\\cdot\\\\partial_{\\\\vec{r}} -{n(n+1)\\\\over 4}{\\\\cal M}t^{n-1} \\\\vec{r}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{r} -{x\\\\over 2}(n+1) t^n : Y_m^{(j)} = -t^{m+1/2} \\\\partial_{r_j} - \\\\left(m+{1\\\\over 2}\\\\right) {\\\\cal M} t^{m-1/2} r_j : M_n = - t^n {\\\\cal M} : R_n^{(jk)} = -t^n \\\\left( r_j \\\\partial_{r_k} - r_k \\\\partial_{r_j}\\\\right) This shows how the central extension M_0 of the non- semi-simple and finite-dimensional Schr√∂dinger algebra becomes a component of an infinite family in the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìVirasoro algebra. In addition, and in analogy with either the Virasoro algebra or the Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra, further central extensions are possible. However, a non-vanishing result only exists for the commutator [X_n, X_{n'}], where it must be of the familiar Virasoro form, namely : [X_n, X_{n'}]= (n-n') X_{n+n'} + {c\\\\over 12}(n^3-n)\\\\delta_{n+n',0} or for the commutator between the rotations R_n^{(jk)}, where it must have a Kac-Moody form. Any other possible central extension can be absorbed into the Lie algebra generators. The role of the Schr√∂dinger group in mathematical physics Though the Schr√∂dinger group is defined as symmetry group of the free particle Schr√∂dinger equation, it is realized in some interacting non-relativistic systems (for example cold atoms at criticality). The Schr√∂dinger group in d spatial dimensions can be embedded into relativistic conformal group in d+1 dimensions SO(2,d+2). This embedding is connected with the fact that one can get the Schr√∂dinger equation from the massless Klein‚ÄìGordon equation through Kaluza‚ÄìKlein compactification along null-like dimensions and Bargmann lift of Newton‚ÄìCartan theory. This embedding can also be viewed as the extension of the Schr√∂dinger algebra to the maximal parabolic sub-algebra of SO(2,d+2). The Schr√∂dinger group symmetry can give rise to exotic properties to interacting bosonic and fermionic systems, such as the superfluids in bosons , and Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids in fermions. They have applications in condensed matter and cold atoms. The Schr√∂dinger group also arises as dynamical symmetry in condensed-matter applications: it is the dynamical symmetry of the Edwards‚ÄìWilkinson model of kinetic interface growth.M. Henkel, Eur. Phys. J. Spec. Topics 226, 605 (2017) It also describes the kinetics of phase-ordering, after a temperature quench from the disordered to the ordered phase, in magnetic systems.  References  C. R.

Communique issued at the conclusion of the Twenty-Ninth Meeting of the Conference. http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/29hgc_2008_communique.jsp = Past efforts at standardisation of border controls = In 2007, CARICOM hosted ICC Cricket World Cup during the period 13 March to 28 April 2007. In preparation for this surge of international visitors to the nine host countries, the Region introduced several standardised security measures to facilitate the ease of processing visitors. Dominica also agreed to implement the standardised security. Such features included the introduction of an Advance Passenger Information System, a standardised Embarkation/Disembarkation (E/D) Card and a Common CARICOM Visa. Another significant feature was a standardised wristband that was applied to persons travelling via air or transiting to cruise ship vessels. This security band, which featured a different random colour for each day, allowed persons who had already entered one of the Participating nine countries or Dominica to be considered as domestic travelers. The wristband travelers were recognised by immigration as travelling within a virtual Single Domestic Space,The Single Domestic Space was in effect from February 1 to May 15, 2007. Site www.caricomimpacs.org and as such were not processed as international travelers. The wristband initiative was a collaborative effort between the Participating CARICOM Member States, the Joint Regional Communications Centre (JRCC) and the Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (IMPACS).

Legislation  In CARICOM, the introduction of any new system must be accompanied by relevant legislation. For CARIPASS, two pieces of legislation are required for the document to be recognised as a valid travel document, and to ensure the automatic gates are recognised as legitimate immigration checkpoints. These are the CARIPASS Treaty and CARIPASS national legislation. The CARIPASS Treaty entered into force following the signature of six CARICOM Member States in March 2010.http://www.belize.org/bcci/resourcesmodule/.../id/.../@random4c7452c28f4ac/ To date, seven CARICOM Member States are party to the CARIPASS Treaty, six of which are participating states in the CARIPASS System. The model CARIPASS legislation was coordinated through the Office of the General Counsel, CARICOM. The model legislation is pending review by the Legal Affairs Committee of CARICOM, but would be completed and distributed to all CARICOM States in 2011. Each State must be party to the CARIPASS Treaty and enact any relevant national legislation prior to launching the System. Below is a list of the participating member states with details on the CARIPASS Treaty.Haiti is also a signatory to the CARIPASS Treaty, although not currently a Participating Member State in the CARIPASS System. http://caripass.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=68:progress&catid;=1:latest- news&Itemid;=95 ;Member states who have signed the treaty * Antigua and Barbuda (12 March 2010) * Grenada (12 March 2010) * St. Kitts and Nevis (12 March 2010) * Saint Lucia (11 March 2010) * Trinidad and Tobago (12 March 2010) ;Member states who have acceded to the treaty *Guyana (27 April 2010) ;Member states who have not yet signed the treaty * Barbados * Dominica * Jamaica * St. Vincent & the Grenadines Eligibility The Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM agreed to the eligibility categories for the introduction of the CARIPASS. Given that the CARIPASS uses biometric technology to match the cardholder against the information within the CARIPASS System, the cardholder must be a minimum of sixteen (16) years of age. One reason for the age requirement is that biometrics, such as fingerprints and iris shape can change with age.The Sisyphean Struggle for Biometric Security - Richard Adhikari http://www.technewsworld.com/story/71067.html Under the proposed free movement of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas (2001), the Conference of Heads of Government supported the movement of CARICOM nationals and therefore agreed to first implement the CARIPASS for CARICOM nationals of and resident within Participating States. Although the CARIPASS will be used within a permanent virtual Single Domestic Space, CARICOM continues to hold discussions towards reintroducing a Common Visa Regime. As such, it was also agreed that the CARIPASS would be open to some non-CARICOM nationals who had legal resident status in one or more of the Participating States but would not require a visa to enter any of the Participating States.  Use of the CARIPASS  CARIPASS offers access to either the automatic immigration gate or the designated CARIPASS immigration lane. Random immigration compliance checks continue to be a policy practiced by immigration officials in all states, and this system is expected to reflect this international norm. In CARICOM, all travelers are still required to complete an Embarkation / Disembarkation (E/D) card. The automatic gate dispenses a receipt which replaces the traditional stamp in a passport, and provides the cardholder with proof of entry or exit from the State. This receipt is a legal document which also guides persons as to length of stay or any other immigration guideline that should be noted upon landing. CARICOM citizens using the CARIPASS are automatically granted a six- month stay when visiting another participating state, while eligible non- CARICOM citizens are automatically granted three months.  Future  Although the CARIPASS System was projected for launch in 2009, several challenges have affected this initial timeline. Installation of the System began in November 2010.CARICOM to launch Multilateral Automated Travel Document - http://www.planetbiometrics.com/article-details/i/401/ Media coverage of the progress of the project reflects several launch dates, including January 2009, July 2009, and July 2010. While the Caribbean Community anticipates the expansion of the acceptance of this travel document to all CARICOM Member and Associate States, the proffered launch dates have passed without movement forward. Marked increases in skepticism among the Caribbean public with respect to both the relevance and direction of CARICOM and its regional integration process in general, may affect the successful launch and expansion of CARIPASS.CARICOM: It's Leadership that's needed - Ronald Sanders http://www.trinidadexpress.com/commentaries/Caricom__It_s_leadership_that_s_needed-116369794.html  See also CARICOM passport *APEC Business Travel Card *NEXUS  References   External links  *Caribbean Community Secretariat website *CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and Security website *21st Inter- Sessional Heads of CARICOM Meeting *CARICOM Law website *Idnoticias website Caribbean Community Institutions of the Caribbean Community International travel documents Expedited border crossing schemes ","title":"CARIPASS"},{"id":"30914137","text":"J.

Its name derives from a field where the topsoil was removed and the clay beneath was stripped, and mixed with chalk and ash to create bricks. The field could then be used for horticulture. In Kent it was often planted with fruit trees. Brickfields were mainly created from 1770 to 1881, when a new shaly clay was discovered at Fletton. This period coincided with the housing and railway boom in London and cheap river transport in Thames sailing barges. Brickfields existed elsewhere, but often the clay layer was deeper or there was no chalk in the proximity. Geology The southeast of England consists of rock strata that is more recent than most of Great Britain. It consists of a large denuded anticline, an anticline that has been eroded away leaving a series of escarpments separated by low lying vales, The Cretaceous ridges are known as the North Downs and South Downs. The Downs have been cut through, with the Medway Valley being the most prominent. The Hoo peninsula is an Eocene (Thanet sands) ridge. The London basin is an Eocene structure composed of London Clay. All this solid geology is covered with a layer of brown structureless loam (Head), and muds deposited by the rivers. Both the head and the fluvial mud are called brickearth. Water is also needed, the rivers are saline so wells and boreholes need to be dug through the three Cretaceous chalk layers to the impermeable Gault Clay. Taking the parish of Frindsbury as a referenced example: about of acidic topsoil covers about of head, which lies on the alkaline Thanet Sands. There are five layers of sands with different properties- the light grey sands are themselves marketable and are used in the brickmaking process, and as moulding sand for metal foundries. Process A field was leased from the farmer and it was 'uncallowed' (the topsoil removed). The soil had been farmed and in the Medway area it had been chalked every five years with 'fat chalk' extracted from the 'dene holes'. The head, or clay was now dug from the field in winter by workers (diggers) on piecework rates. This was calculated on the volume extracted. 44 ft by 8 ft by 6 ft would make 33000 bricks. The dug clay was left exposed in heaps to weather. =Washmill= The washmill was usually a sunken circular pit that was brick lined. It was deep, and in diameter. A horse pulled a centrally pivoted beam with rakes that broke up the weathered clay and mixed it into a slurry. It was here that the correct proportion of chalk, some river mud and even rags were added. The rags would help the combustion. Clay alone would be too brittle. The popular Kentish yellows (London stock bricks) used 10-17% of chalk. The surface of the porous yellow stock, reacted chemically with the sulphur dioxide in the polluted air to form an impermeable glaze as well as an attractive colour. =Washback= When the liquid slurry was ready it was 'laundered' along wooden pipes into square washbacks, the water seeped away leaving a stiff clay mix . This process was dependent on the weather. =Brickmoulding= The brickmaking was done by 'gangs' of persons who were usually a family unit. They each had a 'berth', situated in front of a washback. It contained a bench with a pugmill behind. The pugmill had an inlet hopper, and moved the clay mix along a six-foot tube using an Archimedes screw. The pugging process cut up the clay and made it more pliable. Pugmills were attached to a power source by lineshafts and belting. The gang consisted of a 'temperer', who cut the clay out of the washback and loaded it into a wheeled barrow, and took it to the berth where he emptied it into the hopper. The 'flatie' took the extruded clay and rolled it in sand, and handed it to the moulder. The moulder had a rectangular mould that he sprinkled with sand, that slotted onto a base on the bench. The clay was thrown into the mould with great force. That done, tapping the mould release the newly formed brick (green brick). They were removed from the bench by the 'off bearer' who staked them next to the bench. A 'barrow loader' stacked 30 green bricks in a barrow. The 'pusher outer' wheeled the green bricks to a 'hack' where they would dry off. The hack would contain 1000 bricks stacked on boards, seven courses high. These were dried for 5 weeks losing about in weight- these were now called 'white bricks'. =Cowl= The traditional method of firing bricks was to use a cowl (or clamp). A cowl was a stack of 750 'white bricks' laid on edge, and about apart leaving channels for the fuel. The stack would be 32 courses high. The white brick stack was covered with rejected bricks that would help retain the heat. The fuel was known as 'rough stuff' or 'London mixture'. It was made in winter by 'scrying' sifting out the half burnt coal from domestic rubbish which had been retrieved from London by barge, then left to rot for a year or so. The finer ash was added to the slurry, and the larger remains used in the cowls. The cowl was fired and a 'scintler' moved outer bricks during the firing to aid airflow. The centre of the cowl fired at 900 deg C. When the firing was complete, 'sorters' dismantled the cowl. Bricks were sorted into: * First stocks ‚Äì yellow facings * Second stocks ‚Äì straw facings * Third stocks ‚Äì interior walls * Roughs ‚Äì used for footings * Burrs ‚Äì used for hardcore * Chuffs ‚Äì rejected Later, in the larger brickfields these cowls were replaced by permanent kilns. =Scotch kilns= The updraught kiln, also called a Scotch Kiln, was rectangular and open-topped with fire holes along the bottom; it was a permanent cowl. It was filled with bricks and it allowed the hot gases to rise amongst them. The downdraught kiln was circular and about 15 ft in diameter; the hot gases rose but were deflected back down onto the bricks. This was more efficient in fuel consumption; opening ports in the roof allowed more fuel to be introduced during the firing when necessary. The Hoffmann Continuous Kiln was the first move towards mass production. It was a series of downdraught kilns, connected in a circle or in a long rectangle. Each kiln had an access channel to the next so as soon as the one kiln was fully firing process, the waste heat would begin to fire the next. The fires would thus burn around in sequence. When the firing was complete, the bricks had time to cool before they were removed. the kiln was reloaded with green bricks and in turn the kiln would be fired once more. There was always an empty kiln ready to take fresh green bricks so production was not interrupted by waiting for a firing to be completed. A kiln of this type is still in use at a brickworks in Rainham. The next development was the Long Continuous Kiln where bricks were stacked on flat wagons which were slowly passed through a chamber where hot gases could circulate around them.

These individual acts of protest mostly took place in front of a government building following an unsuccessful approach to the authorities. Four self-immolators have died of their burns so far. It began on 12 January, when 26-year-old Mohamed Aouichia set himself on fire in Bordj Menaiel in the compound of the daira building. He had been sharing a room of 30 square metres with seven other people, including his sister, since 2003; he had repeatedly approached local authorities to get on the social housing list and been rebuffed. He has so far survived. On 13 January, Mohsen Bouterfif, a 37-year-old father of two, set himself on fire. He had gone with about twenty other youths to protest in front of the town hall of Boukhadra in Tebessa demanding jobs and houses, after the mayor refused to receive them. According to one testimony, the mayor shouted to them: \\"If you have courage, do like Bouazizi did, set yourself on fire!\\" His death was reported on 16 January, and about 100 youths protested his death causing the provincial governor to sack the mayor. However, hospital staff the following day claimed he was still alive, though in critical condition. Al Jazeera described the suicide as \\"echoing the self-immolation that triggered the protests that toppled the leader of neighbouring Tunisia.\\" He finally died on 24 January at a hospital in Annaba. These suicides were followed by dozens more attempted or successful self-immolations across the country, so far without triggering nationwide demonstrations, most of them after the Tunisian dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled his country on 14 January; cases included: * 14 January:  Said H. (26 years old, unemployed bachelor), in front of the Urban Security offices in Jijel; taken to hospital with no visits allowed.AFP, 17/01/2011, Un Alg√©rien s'immole par le feu , El Watan, 17/01/2011, Jijel : Le jeune Sa√Ød √©vacu√© √† A√Øn Na√¢dja , Jijel.info, 19/11/2011, \\"Prions pour Sa√Ød\\" * 15 January:  Senouci Touati (34 years old, unemployed), in Mostaganem - had not heard of the previous Algerian cases; frustrated by what he considered an unjustified discharge from the army without a pension. * 16 January:  About 20 harraga (would-be illegal emigrants) from Annaba, who attempted to set their boat on fire when approached by the coast guard; the fire was extinguished, but the fate of two of the people on the boat is unknown. * 17 January:  Maamir Lotfi (36 years old, unemployed father of four), in front of the El Oued town hall; had unsuccessfully asked to meet the governor; taken to hospital with second- degree burns; died on 12 February * 18 January:  Karim Benidine (35-year-old bachelor said to have mental problems), in front of the town hall in Dellys, critically burned and transferred to hospital.AFP, 19/01/2011, Alg√©rie: 7e tentative d'immolation par le feu dans l'est du pays ; Le Temps, 19/01/2011, 3 personnes s‚Äôimmolent par le feu √† Dellys, Sidi Bel Abb√®s et El Oued He died from his burns on 22 January at Douera hospital in Algiers.  A young man (23 years old), at Berriane in the Sahara; attempted to burn himself in front of the daira office; saved with only light burns on his right foot * 19 January:  Afif Hadri (37-year-old father of six), in El Oued, saved in time by onlookers.  G. Seguir (54 years old, blind and handicapped), in M'Sila, covered himself in an Algerian flag and sprinkled himself, his 11-year-old son, and his 8-year-old daughter with petrol while standing in front of the wilaya seat, threatening to set himself and them on fire. After an hour of tense negotiations with an official, he let the children go and tried to set himself on fire; the onlookers managed to stop the fire and took him to hospital. Reportedly, the immediate provocation was that his family's electricity had been left cut off by Sonelgaz even after he scraped together the money to pay the bill.; ;  K. L. (26 years old), inside the tribunal of Ras El Oued near Bordj Bou Arreridj, after the authorities refused to return his motorcycle which was confiscated after an accident; he was stopped quickly, and survived with only light burns. The Ministry of Religious Affairs responded to this wave of self-immolations by devoting the Friday sermons of 21 January to admonitions of patience and reminders that suicide is forbidden in Islam. However, some cases continued to be reported over coming days: * 23 January:  A teenager in Oued Taourrira near Sidi Bel Abbes set himself on fire, apparently following a family altercation. * 25 January:  Kamel Bouria (38-year-old fireman, father of one), in Oum El Bouaghi, set himself on fire following workplace difficulties. Another fireman at the same station, Karim Mehanaine, had threatened to do the same some days earlier, but been dissuaded. * 26 January:  A young man (26‚Äì28 years old, unemployed) in front of the wilaya seat at Djelfa, who shouted \\"Hagrouni\\" (They have wronged me) as he burned; said to have been protesting exclusion from the housing list * 28 January:  Abdelhafid Boudechicha (destitute 29-year-old day labourer living with his parents and five siblings), at Medjana, who shouted repeatedly \\"I'm fed up!\\" then asked his mother's forgiveness - died the next day of his burns. Said by his friends to have despaired of ever finding a job or housing. * 29 January:  B. S. (29 years old, son of an entrepreneur from Aachacha), in front of Mohamed Khemisti High School next to the wilaya seat at Mostaganem - suffered third-degree burns. According to security forces, this was related to disappointment in love. * 30 January:  A Local Development Bank security guard at Staoueli (Algiers) attempted to burn himself in the course of a protest by bank workers against the bank's director.  S. Hakimi (about 30 years old, working at the water company ADE) - sprinkled himself with petrol at ADE's director's office in Tizi Ouzou but was stopped from setting himself alight, apparently protesting an arbitrary transfer. * 6 February:  At a protest called for by the National Committee for the Rights of the Unemployed, a young man with a job as a security guard on 6000 dinars a month drenches himself in petrol, but is stopped before managing to light a match. * 9 February:  A 25-year-old man from Chrea near Tebessa sets himself on fire in protest of police's failure to respond to his complaint of having been beaten up; he is taken to hospital badly injured. * 18 February:  A married man threatens to set himself on fire at the daira office of Sidi M'hamed (Algiers), but is dissuaded, and instead got to see the governor, Rabah Mokdad, about his housing problems. * 21 February:  Three fathers formerly working at Socothyd (a cotton factory), M. Ahmed, K. Sadek et S. Farid, between 35 and 43 years old, attempt to set themselves on fire in Issers near Boumerdes, after their requests to return to the jobs they had been fired from in 2006 were rejected. They had been fired in the wake of a strike campaign against the privatisation of the factory. They were stopped with some injuries and taken to hospital. * 4 October A 19-year-old, who was refused permission to resit the Baccalaureat exam at his former secondary school in Oran * 8 October  An Algerian woman who had been evicted from her flat in Oran died after setting herself and her three-year-old son on fire.

History Pueblo Criminal arose in 2006 out of the hardcore formation Chlambr√ºd consisting of the five members Viero (guitar), Victor T (bass), Chriss (vocals), Pipo (organ) and Neyman (drums). Due to a musical reorientation towards ska-punk with influences of reggae and Latin music, the band has been augmented steadily. In 2006, alto and baritone saxophonist MR Sax and trombonist Gabriela joined Pueblo Criminal. After some first experiences at the Basel City Studios in 2001 with Chlambr√ºd, the recordings of the debut album Bang Gang of Pueblo Criminal were started in 2006 at the band's own studio in Schwerzenbach ZH. By the end of August 2009, all tracks were recorded. After this long work, Pueblo Criminal went to the Red Led Studios in Madrid, where producer Tony L√≥pez (Ska-P) and audio engineer Rub√©n Su√°rez finalized the CD in December 2009. Almost at the same time, the band was completed by trumpeter Sam and second guitarist Millo. In October 2010, Bang Gang was released as CD and download. After several gigs in Switzerland, Pueblo Criminal was invited for a small tour of D√ºsseldorf and Bochum in November 2010. At the beginning of December 2010, the formation played at Eulachhalle in Winterthur as a support act for Ska-P. On 7 December, the CD release party of Bang Gang took place at the Mascotte club in Zurich, where the band won the \\"4th Band-Cover-Contest\\" two months later. In summer 2011, Pueblo Criminal played at many festivals as at the Heitere Open Air in Zofingen and Imagine Festival in Basel. After the two-week tour of Costa Rica in July 2011, the band could gain a foothold in Central America.

Early surfing years  Townend, born in Coolangatta, Queensland (Australia), was considered to be one of the best surfers in the world throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Townend had an extensive r√©sum√© apart from surfing, including movie stuntman, contest organizer, writer, publisher, marketer, and coach to future champions.World Champions of Surfing ‚Äî. Ed. IDW Publishing. 2011. Web. 18 Feb. 2011.. Townend began surfing in 1967 and attended his first competition in 1969. By this time he was already shaping boards as well as doing promotional work for Gordon and Smith Australia and working as a UPI journalist for the Sydney Daily Mirror. Townend was building a life in the surfing industry and simultaneously funding his travels. Townend was very competitive, as evidenced by his repeated contest performances at the Australian National Titles. He took 2nd in the juniors division in 1971 and then 2nd in the men‚Äôs division in 1972, 1973, 1974, and 1976. He later made history when, at 23 years old, he became the first IPS/ASP World Surfing Champion in 1976. Shortly afterwards Townend co-founded the Bronzed Aussies in an attempt to not only legitimize surfing, but build a global franchise and attract well-funded sponsors to the sport. Many surfers, however, did not accept the clean living lifestyle and the movement eventually fell apart. Townend spent much of 1977 riding waves as William Kat's stunt double in the filming of Big Wednesday. By 1978, Townend was again focused on competition with back-to-back IPS 5th-place finishes in 1978 and 1979.\\"Peter Townend Biography and Photos  SURFLINE.COM.\\" SURFLINE.COM  Global Surf Reports, Surf Forecasts, Live Surf Cams and Coastal Weather. Aug. 2000. Web. 18 Feb. 2011. . He finally took a much deserved first-place victory at the Hang Ten contest in Durban, South Africa in 1979.  Other jobs  In the same year, Townend moved to Huntington Beach, California to serve as America's National Team coach and executive director. During his tenure, he coached many future world tour contenders including three-time world champion Tom Curren. He also coached the Americans to a win at the World Amateur Championships. By 1984, Townend had begun working for Surfing Magazine, eventually moving up to associate publisher and advertising director. This led to a position as marketing director for Rusty surf wear in 1999. He also got a job as the voice for Prime Ticket and ESPN as a color commentator for the Association of Surfing Professionals World Championship Tour and the Bud Pro Surfing Tour. Townend was president of the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association (SIMA) for two years and helped found Surfing America, \\"an organization that oversees ASP North America and the Fosters Pro Surfing Tour and helps focus amateur surfers towards professional competition\\". As of 2010, Townend serves on the Board of Directors for USA Skateboarding with the goal to get skateboarding into the Olympics and is founder and owner of ActivEmpire, a company which specializes in action sports brand and media consultancy, coaching, athlete management and promotions. Awards Townend was inducted into the Huntington Beach Walk of Fame in 1998 and the Australian Surfing Hall of Fame in 2001, as well as the International Surfing Hall of Fame. He received the lifetime achievement award from SIMA in 2013.

It was unsuccessful financially, and was leased to the Great Western Railway in 1861. The network suffered from being on the broad gauge when many pits and rival railways used the narrow (standard) gauge, but the GWR extended the network into Cwm Clydach and the line became heavily used. The Ely Valley Extension Railway and the Ely and Clydach Valleys Railway were nominally independent additions to the network, also controlled by the GWR. A limited passenger service was started in 1901. The use of the network declined in the 1920s but the passenger service continued until 1958. The general mineral traffic collapsed in the 1960s but final closure only occurred when Cwm Colliery closed on 2 March 1987. First railways The mineral resources of the upper end of the valley of the River Taff encouraged the development of iron smelting industries at Merthyr and Dowlais, and these were dominant by the first decades of the nineteenth century. Transport of the products to market was always a problem, and the Glamorganshire Canal of 1794 and primitive tramroads connecting to it were an early response.Charles Hadfield, The Canals of South Wales and the Border, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, second edition 1957, The Taff Vale Railway was opened in 1840 and 1841 throughout from Merthyr to Cardiff Docks, and was immediately successful. It was a narrow (standard) gauge line; its course was through the present-day Abercynon and Pontypridd.D S M Barrie, The Taff Vale Railway, Oakwood Press, Tisbury, second edition 1950 reprinted 1982 Mineral extraction at Dihewyd, near Llantwit Fardre, attracted interest, and a private railway was built from pits there to the Glamorganshire Canal at Maesbach. The pits and the railway were owned by Thomas Powell. The line had a rope-worked incline to descend into the Taff valley. It opened in April 1844 and was known as the Llantwit Fardre Railway. Colin Chapman, The Llantrisant Branches of the Taff Vale Railway: a History of the Llantrissant and Taff Vale Junction Railway and the Treferig Valley Railway, The Oakwood Press, Headington, 1996, D S M Barrie, revised by Peter E Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 12: South Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, second edition ,1994, Promoters associated with the Great Western Railway obtained authorisation for a trunk line from near Gloucester to Milford Haven, connecting South Wales to the GWR network and London, and the first section of their line between Chepstow and Swansea opened on 18 June 1850. Both lines were engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, but the South Wales Railway was built on the broad gauge. It had a station called Llantrisant, although it was two miles from the town of that name.The station is now known as Pontyclun. As a trunk railway, the South Wales Railway made few connections to collieries and iron mines, and the development of these industries in the area close to the main line was as yet limited.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume I: 1833 - 1863, part 2, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927 In 1840 there was mineral activity in the Rhondda but at this stage it was limited to the area around Dinas, served by tramroads with which an 1841 branch of the Taff Vale Railway connected; the westward extension was in the future. In 1845 a Rhondda and Ely Valley Railway was proposed; it would leave the South Wales Railway at Llantrisant and run to the head of the Rhondda Fawr, connecting also to proposed railways in the Ogmore Valley. On 16 September 1845 the promoters published their intention to obtain an Act of Parliament authorising their line; the Taff Vale Railway had been aware of the move (from prior public meetings) and simultaneously published its own corresponding proposals to reach the Rhondda Fawr; the far greater resources resulted in the Ely Valley scheme being abandoned immediately.Colin Chapman, The Ely Valley Railway: Llantrisant ‚Äì Penygraig, The Oakwood Press, Usk, 2000, Ely Valley Railway authorised In October 1856 it was announced that the Ely and Rhondda Valleys Railway was being promoted, although at first it would only build eight miles of line, from Llantrisant to Dinas (Penygraig). In November the statutory Parliamentary notice was published; the company name had been altered to the Ely Valley Railway; it was to be a broad gauge line miles long from Llantrisant to Penrhiwfer, with two branches. It was primarily a mineral railway, and passengers would not be carried. The Bill went to Parliament and encountered only limited opposition, and it received the Royal Assent on 13 July 1857, with capital of ¬£70,000. At the first formal board meeting it was decided to seek powers to build a branch to the productive Mwyndy iron ore mine, and possibly on to Brofiscin Quarry. This was successfully achieved in the 1857 session, with an additional ¬£13,000 of capital authorised. Construction work was soon under way, and the directors decided that it was a high priority to open to the Mwyndy mine so as to bring some money in. Temporary track and horse traction was used to manage this, and an informal opening took place before 22 February 1859. Ely Tidal Harbour The Ely Tidal Harbour and Railway Company had been incorporated by Act of 21 July 1856 to build a harbour at the mouth of the River Ely, to the west of Cardiff, and to build a narrow (standard) gauge railway to meet the Taff Vale Railway at the place that is now Radyr. The primary purpose of this was to relieve the congestion at the Bute docks on the east side of Cardiff, and on the approach lines of the TVR. The following year, on 27 July 1857 the Company changed its name to the Penarth Harbour, Dock and Railway, and the scope was increased to add the dock. The harbour was relatively quickly made ready, opening for business on 18 July 1859, but the dock took considerably longer, in fact until 1865. As well as carrying the traffic of the TVR to its new harbour, the Penarth company was interested in the traffic that might come from the Ely company, located as it was on the west side of Cardiff. A meeting took place between the two companies on 15 December 1858, at which the Penarth company suggested a narrow (standard) gauge link between them. When the Ely Valley Railway was planned, the only other railway in the vicinity was the broad gauge South Wales Railway, and it seemed obvious at the time to make the EVR line on the same gauge. On reflection, however, this posed some serious disadvantages; iron ore bound for the Merthyr and Dowlais smelters had to travel via Neath and the Vale of Neath Railway, and be transhipped near the end of the journey. Moreover there were limited facilities at Cardiff for supplying ships from broad gauge wagons. The Penarth company now recommended a narrow gauge connection, and the idea seemed attractive to the Ely Valley Railway directors. In addition to the EVR converting its system to the narrow gauge, this could best be achieved by the South Wales Railway laying a third rail, to make mixed gauge track between Llantrisant and the junction for Penarth; in fact the scheme escalated to include the route as far as the Bute East Dock, mutual running powers being offered. The South Wales Railway was not hostile to these arrangements, but wished to get GWR acquiescence. In fact the GWR were entirely opposed to the plan, seeing no benefit to compensate for the expense of carrying it out, and the negotiations were at an end; the EVR had wrapped up a number of secondary, but important, issues in the talks, and now these were lost as well. As a fallback, the EVR and the Penarth company discussed the building of a connecting line between the two systems; all seemed to be going well, with discussion of assistance with funding. But in March 1860 the magnitude of the costs involved in building the new line and converting the existing EVR system was addressed, and it was quickly seen that the whole thing was not affordable. MacDermot, volume I part 2, page 580 Opening the line The EVR was not yet fully open, and thoughts now turned urgently to the working arrangements for their line. On 15 June 1860, an agreement was concluded with the joint operating committee of the South Wales Railway and the Great Western RailwayThe GWR was working the South Wales Railway by contract. as to the working of the Mwyndy branch by the GWR, and a corresponding agreement for the Ely Valley main line was finalised soon after. The effective date of these agreements was to be 1 August 1860. On 2 August 1860 a ceremonial opening of the lines took place. As well as the Mwyndy branch, the main line ran from Llantrisant station to Penrhiwfer, a little beyond Tonyrefail, where there were important collieries. There were two short branches: one was to Castellau, diverging north-eastward not far north of Llantrisant; the other was to Gellirhaidd, running to the west from a point not far south of Penrhiwfer.MacDermot, volume I part 2, page 861 The Mwyndy branch was extended to Brofiscin, opening on 8 January 1862. Barrie and Baughan say that Gellirhaidd opened in January 1862. Lease to the Great Western Railway For some time the Great Western Railway, quite independently of the South Wales Railway, had taken an interest in the developing collieries near Gyfeillon, in the Rhondda a little west of Pontypridd, where excellent quality steam coal was being extracted. In 1854 the GWR had leased a colliery belonging to John Calvert, using it to supply locomotive coal. It became known as the Great Western Mine. The GWR now approached the EVR with a proposal to acquire the network; the plan was to extend it to Gyfeillon, giving the GWR broad gauge access from the colliery to its system. The EVR asked for ¬£100,000 in cash to purchase, and difficult negotiations progressed, ending with a 999 year lease, taking ¬£35,000 worth of EVR shares and guaranteeing 5% per annum on ¬£80,000. This was agreed and was effective from 1 January 1861, being ratified by Act of Parliament of 29 July 1862. (in fact the Gyfeillon extension was never built.) Narrow gauge lines at Llantrisant  At the time these discussions were proceeding, the Taff Vale Railway were encouraging the promotion of what became the Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway, a line to Llantrisant from near Treforest, connecting up numerous small mines on between, and forming an intrusion into territory that the broad gauge companies considered their own. The L&TVJR; was authorised on 7 June 1861, and opened part of its line at the northern end on 17 September 1863. However the southern end of the L&TVJR; was a junction with the broad gauge Ely Valley Railway at Maesaraul. The Cowbridge Railway was designed to give the town a connection to the merging railway network, but was short of funding. When the Taff Vale Railway assisted it by taking part of the share issue, it was inevitable that the line would be built on the narrow gauge. The Cowbridge Railway intended to cross the South Wales Railway main line and connect with the L&TVJR; at Maesaraul, but this proved beyond its means, and it settled for running into a platform alongside the South Wales Railway station at Llantrisant. That left a gap between the two narrow gauge systems; as part of the negotiation in Parliamentary committees, the GWR undertook to mix the gauge on the Ely Valley Railway between Maesaraul and Llantrisant, enabling through running; the necessary running powers were granted to the Cowbridge Railway.Colin Chapman, The Cowbridge Railway, Oxford Publishing Company, Poole, 1984, In fact a second, narrow gauge, line was built from Llantrisant to Mwyndy Junction, the lines being mixed onward from there. The Taff Vale Railway worked the trains on both the Cowbridge and L&TVJR; systems, so that passenger trains ran through from Pontypridd to Cowbridge, reversing at Llantrisant. This started on 18 September 1865, when the Ely Valley Railway had finally got approval from the Board of Trade for passenger operation over the mixed gauge section. The Cowbridge Railway had opened for goods traffic on 30 January 1865. The Ely Valley Railway had separately undertaken to lay mixed gauge track to enable access for the L&TVJR; to Mwyndy, but, no doubt encouraged by the Great Western Railway, was very slow to do so, and a legalistic point over the extent of the branch was used to delay matters. It was not until 5 December 1864 that the installation of mixed gauge was done. North from Penrhiwfer The northern terminus of the Ely Valley Railway was at Penrhiwfer, near Tonyrefail; there were important pits there. There were further productive pits a little further north, near Penygraig, in Cwm Clydach. In 1860 a Parliamentary Bill to build such an extension was withdrawn, but the EVR negotiated privately with the landowners; with their agreement a mineral railway could be built without Parliamentary sanction. The agreement was finalised in October 1860 and the extension was opened to traffic in December 1862. The northern terminus was now at Dinas Goods Station, immediately north of Penygraig colliery. The extension was ratified by Act of 30 July 1866. Ely and Clydach Valleys Railway Cwm Clydach was a little further on and the existing pits were served by the TVR Pwllyrhebog branch. This involved a 1 in 13 incline, at this stage a rope worked incline operated on the balanced load system without a stationary steam engine. This was causing congestion as traffic volumes increased, and when a new pit was sunk further up the valley at Clydach Vale in 1872, potentially overwhelming the incline, the Ely Valley Railway considered it was time to compete with the TVR. A nominally independent Ely and Clydach Valleys Railway was promoted in 1872, to run from a junction near Dinas on the EVRNow effectively part of the Great Western Railway. to the head of Cwm Clydach, nearly two miles away. The company obtained its authorising Act on 5 August 1873. It opened, at least in part, on 10 August 1878, but the anticipated traffic was a long time in coming, partly because of an agreement between the coalmaster and the Taff Vale Railway for exclusivity of carriage of its output. The Ely and Clydach Valleys Railway was vested in the Great Western Railway effective from 27 August 1880, by Act of Parliament of 6 August. Ely Valley Extension Railway The terminus of the Gellirhaidd branch appeared ideal for a westward extension into the Ogmore Valleys, and from 1857 a number of schemes were out forward. These were without success until 28 July 1863 when the Ely Valley Extension Railway was authorised, though in a much reduced form compared with its promoters' intentions. Instead of forming a link from Gellirhaidd into the Ogmore Valley, it was reduced to a stump from Hendreforgan to Gilfach Goch only; at this stage Hendreforgan had not been reached by any railway.MacDermot volume II, page 83 At the same time the Ogmore Valley Railway was authorised to build from Tondu via Blackmill to the present-day Nantymoel at the head of the Ogmore Valley. The promoters had observed the disadvantages of small railways adopting the broad gauge, and they determined that their line would be on the narrow (standard) gauge. However their isolated position among broad gauge lines challenged the ability of their line to get the mineral products away to Cardiff or anywhere else. The Great Western Railway and the South Wales Railway had now merged, and the promoters of the OVR met with the GWR to ascertain whether they would lay mixed gauge on the main line to accommodate the OVR trains, but this was refused. The OVR proprietors were unabashed, and decided to continue with the construction of their line on the narrow gauge. To get access to a waterway, they now planned to build a line to connect to the narrow gauge Penarth Harbour, Dock and Railway company. This company was friendly to the Taff Vale Railway and the Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway lay in between; an alliance between those companies, and some use of existing railways, would provide an affordable scheme. This was considered in the 1865 session of Parliament and rejected, but a second attempt in 1866 was more successful. Notwithstanding its opposition to laying mixed gauge on the South Wales Main Line, the GWR had given a Parliamentary assurance that it would do so on the portion of the Ely Valley Railway to enable narrow gauge trains to run from Hendreforgan to Common Branch Junction (near Ynysmaerdy) reaching the L&TVJR; there. In the 1865 session of Parliament, the Ogmore and Ely Valley Railways (Amalgamation) ActChapman, Ely Valley Railway, page 33; this may be a mistake for \\"Ogmore and Ely Valley Extension Railways Act\\". was passed, by which the Ely Valley Extension Railway was taken over by the Ogmore Valley Railway. The Ely Valley Extension Railway opened its line on 16 October 1865, and was worked by the Great Western Railway as part of the Ely Valley line. (It was converted to narrow gauge in May 1872 and remained detached from the Ogmore network until the completion of the Black Mill to Hendreforgan line in September 1875.)MacDermot, volume II, page 83 The L&TVJR; secured its New Lines Act on 23 July 1866. It would build a new line on a north-west to south- east diagonal, from the Ely Valley Railway at Ynysmaerdy to Waterhall Junction south of Radyr, on the Penarth Harbour line. The Ogmore Valley Bill was passed on the same day, authorising a connection between Blackmill and Hendreforgan, although the OVR had hoped for much wider extensions elsewhere. Following authorisation, the emphasis on the flow from the Ogmore Valley to Penarth was much reduced, and these lines were slow to be completed; the Blackmill to Hendreforgan line of the OVR (merged to form the Llynvi and Ogmore Railway) was opened on 1 September 1875, and the Hendreforgan ‚Äì Ynysmaerdy link opened on 25 February 1875. The L&TVJR; line to Waterhall Junction, for Penarth, took much longer still, opening on 11 September 1886. Absorption of the South Wales Railway The South Wales Railway had been formed as an independent company, but it was worked throughout its life by the Great Western Railway. Merging of the companies was to be a positive move, and the GWR absorbed the South Wales Railway, effective from 1 August 1863. The Ely Valley Railway was already leased to the SWR and the lease now transferred to the GWR. Castellau branch closed In 1864 a local newspaper reported that \\"The Castella Colliery of Dr Lloyd is nearly exhausted.\\"Cardiff Times, 12 February 1864, quoted in Chapman, Ely Valley Railway and when serviceable permanent way materials were urgently needed to keep the main lines going at a time of great financial pressure, the track of the branch was taken up, some time after 31 January 1867. Gauge conversion For some years the GWR had accepted that the broad gauge was a liability that had to be got rid of, but the latter half of the 1860s were very difficult financially, and the matter was delayed. From 11 May 1872 all the broad gauge lines in South Wales were progressively converted, including the Ely Valley Railway and all other leased and independent lines, the process being completed on 29 May. The two single tracks, broad and narrow gauge, from Llantrisant to Mwyndy Junction were now installed as conventional double track.MacDermot, volume II, page 64 Cil Ely Colliery The GWR had earlier taken a lease on a colliery at Gyfeillon for engine coal, but never used it and relinquished the lease. Now in April 1874 it negotiated a lease with the owner of Cil Ely Colliery, a short distance north of Tonyrefail, and this became a prime supplier to the GWR. Passengers From the outset the Ely Valley Railway had decided that it did not wish to carry passengers, and the relatively small income in a sparsely populated area did not justify the outlay. Over the years the population in the area built up, and the company came under pressure to provide passenger trains. It continued to refuse to do this but in 1893 Glamorgan County Council took the Company to the adjudication court of the Railway and Canal Commissioners. In the days when railways were often a local monopoly, there was legal precedent for Courts to require the provision of a passenger service. Legal argument was finely balanced, and in 1894 the EVR won its case on the basis that it was agreed that substantial infrastructure improvements‚Äîdoubling much of the line (because of the density of mineral traffic), building stations etc‚Äîthat the Court did not have the power to demand. As this was an obvious technicality, the GWR considered how a passenger service might be provided. A double track section between Common Branch Junction and Gellirhaidd Junction, with passing loops at other places, Penrhiwfer and Penygraig, was a starting point, and this was done, opening on 20 December 1896. The section between Gellirhaidd and Penygraig was next on the agenda; there was a summit at Penrhiwfer, and as part of the work, the line would be lowered by 20 feet there. This was carried out some time at the end of 1897 and in 1898. The passenger service started on 1 May 1901. The new stations were at Tonyrefail and Penygraig. There were typically five trains each way daily except Sundays. Coed Ely station was opened further down the valley on 13 July 1925. Absorption by the GWR The Ely Valley Railway network was leased to the Great Western Railway for 999 years. In 1920 the question of absorption was considered by both companies. Both were agreeable to the idea and it took place on 1 July 1903, authorised by Act of 11 August 1903. Ely Valley shareholders received ¬£120 Great Western 5% guaranteed for ¬£100 Ely consolidated.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume I: 1833 - 1863, part 1, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927, page 438 Road competition In the 1920s road competition for passenger transport became active: tramways and trolleybuses at first and then motor buses as interurban roads were improved. Carryings on the passenger trains of the Ely Valley Railway fell disastrously. Freight traffic fared as badly; ordinary goods business was susceptible to more flexible road lorry competition in the same way as the passenger services. The decline of some of the pits, partly from overseas competition, led to falling volumes of mineral traffic. The passenger service on the Ely Valley Extension Railway line (now GWR) was suspended between 5 March and 26 March 1928, and withdrawn finally on 22 September 1930. Goods services continued until 5 June 1961. The end of the Mwyndy branch, actually from Mwyndy siding and Brofiscin, was closed from November 1936. On 31 March 1952 the Llantrisant to Pontypridd passenger service was closed; this had run over part of the Ely Valley network as far as Maesaraul Junction. The last ordinary passenger trains on the Ely Valley Railway itself, between Llantrisant and Penygraig, ran on 7 June 1958, but there was a special excursion to Porthcawl the following day. The entire Ely Valley Extension Railway network was closed on 30 June 1960, as well as the EVR Gellyrhaidd branch, except for a short stub used for stabling banking engines, which remained until 1 March 1964. The line was singled above Gellyrhaidd Junction on 9 September 1963, and south from there to Mwyndy Junction on 3 October 1965. The Cambrian Colliery at Clydach Vale closed on 31 March 1967 and the line above Coed Ely Colliery was closed on 2 April 1967, the line up to that point being operated as a long siding. The Mwyndy branch from Maesaraul Junction was closed on 7 October 1968. The last revenue earning train left Coed Ely colliery on 4 October 1983,Chapman; Barrie and Baughan say total closure above Mwyndy Junction from 30 November 1983. although a special railway enthusiasts' train was allowed to use the line on 31 March 1984. When Cwm Colliery closed on 2 March 1987 the Maesaraul stub which connected the former L&TVJR; line was closed, after 2 March 1987, although an enthusiasts' special train ran on 11 April 1987. Llantrisant locomotive depot There was a locomotive depot at Llantrisant. The original EVR depot was close to the station, but in 1900 this was replaced by a new depot on the eastern side of the line between the station and Mwyndy Junction; this was built to the specifications of William Dean, the GWR Locomotive Superintendent. The stone- built locomotive shed measured ; it had a northlight roof, and contained three tracks for the stabling of locomotives. Alongside this were the depot offices, measuring , and the stores, measuring . The coal stage measured and also carried a water tank with a capacity of . There was also a turntable, a sand drier and some sidings. Access to the depot complex was provided at both ends, although locomotives could not run direct from the station to Mwyndy Junction via the depot without a double reversal. Like Tondu depot to the west, Llantrisant depot was within the Newport division, so locomotives requiring attention which was beyond the capabilities of their equipment would be sent to Ebbw Junction depot at Newport, which was the main shed for the division. In the 1910s, the GWR introduced depot codes, and Llantrisant was coded \\"LTS\\"; these letters were painted on the locomotives, at first inside the cab, but later on towards the front of the locomotive on the framing. A separate code for accountancy purposes was introduced in 1932, and under this system, Llantrisant depot was no. 86; the last digit \\"6\\" denoting the Newport division. In February 1950, British Railways decided to use the depot coding method of the former London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and so Llantrisant was allocated code 86D, the figures 86 denoting the Newport division. This was altered to 88G in October 1960, the figures 88 denoting the Cardiff division; the main depot for the division becoming Cardiff (Canton) at the same time. In January 1938, there were 23 locomotives allocated to Llantrisant; at the end of 1947, 15 steam locomotives were allocated there, plus one Diesel railcar; there were 19 in 1950, and 16 in 1959. Locomotive classes allocated to the shed included members of the 455 class (2-4-0T), the 1400 class (0-4-2T), the 4200 class (2-8-0T) and the 5700 class (0-6-0PT). In addition to these, there was no. 1205, a former Alexandra Docks & Railway 2-6-2T built in 1920, which was used as the Llantrisant shed pilot. The depot closed in October 1964.

Featuring interviews with several well-known philosophers, the film aims to examine the relevance of Karl Marx's ideas in relation to the Great Recession. The film's title is a wordplay on The Matrix Reloaded, the sequel to The Matrix, which is parodied in the documentary. Background According to the film's website, \\"Marx Reloaded ‚Ä¶ examines the relevance of German socialist philosopher Karl Marx's ideas for understanding the global economic and financial crisis of 2008‚Äì09.\\" The film also considers, in the context of an alleged revival of Marxist thinking, whether \\"communism might provide the solution to the growing economic and environmental challenges facing the planet\\". In an interview with Verso Books, writer-director Jason Barker described his intention in making the film \\"to reload or reimagine Marx as a thinker, without the usual totalitarian moralising.\\" Barker criticised the \\"clich√©\\" according to which \\"Marx's diagnoses of capitalism are validated whereas his 'prescription' of communism is rubbished on the grounds that it's 'utopian'.\\" Asked whether the renewed popularity of Marx is evidence of a return of communism as a political force, or \\"just the spectre of Marx haunting the academies\\", Barker replied that \\"political thinking today is again converging on precisely the type of social conditions in which Marx lived.\\" In a separate interview, Barker also discussed the film's use of animation, in particular his decision to parody The Matrix, admitting that although it was an \\"obvious parody\\" and \\"fun to make\\", there was also a philosophical dimension to the animation scenes in which Marx meets Leon Trotsky and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. Film Marx Reloaded features interviews with several well-known philosophers, among them those often associated with Marxism and Communist ideas, including John Gray, Michael Hardt, Antonio Negri, Nina Power, Jacques Ranci√®re, Peter Sloterdijk, Alberto Toscano and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. The film also includes animation scenes with Marx trapped in a surreal world resembling the 1999 science fiction-action film The Matrix, which starred Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. In one such animated scene Marx (Jason Barker) encounters Leon Trotsky (Ivan Nikolic) in a pastiche of the red pill and blue pill scene in The Matrix in which Reeves' character Neo first meets Fishburne's character Morpheus. Reception Marx Reloaded had its TV premiere on Arte on 11 April and was repeated on 20 April. The film was subsequently broadcast on the Romanian television channel B1 TV on 12 August 2011, followed by a studio debate involving political analyst Dinu FlƒÉm√¢nd, journalist Cristian Tudor Popescu and writer Vasile Ernu. Yongjune Park, Jason Barker and Taek-Gwang Lee at DMZ Docs 2011. On 25 September 2011 the film was screened (out of competition) at the 2011 DMZ International Documentary Film Festival. The screening was followed by a panel discussion involving writer-director Jason Barker, Professor Taek-Gwang Lee of Kyung Hee University and Yongjune Park, the editor of Indigo, an English-language Korean humanities magazine. Both the film and director were the subject of national press coverage in the Hankook Ilbo. On 3 October 2011 the film had its Serbian premiere at the Centre for Cultural Decontamination in Belgrade, with further screenings planned in the same venue on 20, 21 and 24 October. Marx Reloaded premiered in the UK on 10 February 2012 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, where it screened to sell-out audiences until 20 April. Reviews of the film have been positive. Time Out London described it as containing \\"enough interesting ideas to make this well worth a watch for those with an interest in philosophy, politics and the general state of the world as we know it.\\" Little White Lies called it an \\"engaging hour-long talking-head-meets-animation doc\\"; \\"the film shines a light on the many causes of the financial crumble, creating a compelling dialogue of Marx's theories on capitalism as they apply to its contemporary form.\\" Subtitledonline.com awarded the film three out of a possible five stars, although criticized it for its \\"failure to balance quirky presentation with challenging content\\". However, writing in CounterPunch, Louis J. Proyect gave an unqualified endorsement: \\"I can't recommend this film highly enough... The film is a fast-paced and even exciting treatment of what might induce a yawn on the printed page\\". As well as reviews The Financial Times featured the film as part of its \\"Capitalism in Crisis\\" series, followed by an interview with Jason Barker and the editor of New Left Review, Robin Blackburn. The London Evening Standard cited the film alongside the 2012 re-edition of The Communist Manifesto (introduced by Eric Hobsbawm) and Owen Jones' best-selling book Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class as evidence of a resurgence of left-wing ideas. Blue or Red Pill? On 16 December 2011, the first in a series of public debates entitled \\"Blue or Red Pill?\\" (Crvena ili plava pilula?) was held at the Centre for Cultural Decontamination (CZKd), Belgrade, in which the social and political themes from the film were explored. Serbian film director ≈Ωelimir ≈Ωilnik ‚Äì himself noted for his socially-engaged film- making, most recently in the 2009 film Stara ≈°kola kapitalizma ‚Äì participated in the event along with Jason Barker. A second debate took place on 15 February 2012 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), in which the BBC Newsnight economics editor Paul Mason, the blogger and The Independent journalist Laurie Penny, and Robin Blackburn joined Jason Barker. The debate considered the implications of Marx's work in the context of a growing popular resistance to the global economic and financial crisis, and whether the revolutionary change advocated by Marx had finally arrived: \\"Is humanity standing at a crossroads where a decision ‚Äì and by whom or in whose name? ‚Äì for \\"another world\\" must be taken?\\" See alsoKarl Marx in film References External links Marx Reloaded Review at Der Tagesspiegel (German site) *Marx Reloaded Review at The Original Sonic Truth blog Marx Reloaded blog (Korean site) 2011 films German films German documentary films Works about Marxism Documentary films about philosophy Documentary films about ideologies Documentary films about the Great Recession 2011 documentary films Films about communism Cultural depictions of Karl Marx Cultural depictions of Leon Trotsky ","title":"Marx Reloaded"},{"id":"30914918","text":" The Salem Social Library (1760-1810) or Social Library in Salem was a proprietary library in Salem, Massachusetts. \\"Twenty-eight gentlemen ... subscribed 165 guineas. ...

World War I On 9 November 1916, Kitto was transferred from the Welch Regiment to the Royal Flying Corps; he was commissioned a second lieutenant and appointed a flying officer. By early 1917, he was posted to 43 Squadron on the Western Front. Using a Sopwith 1 1/2 Strutter, on 17 March 1917, he drove down a German Albatros D.II east of Arras for his first aerial victory. He repeated his feat on both 8 April and 17 August 1917. He then transferred to 54 Squadron as a Sopwith Camel pilot. On 1 December 1917, temporary lieutenant Kitto was appointed a flight commander, with the usual promotion to temporary captain. Between 15 March and 4 July 1918, he scored six more aerial victories, to bring his total to four German planes destroyed and five driven down out of control. On 22 June 1918, he was awarded the Military Cross for his exploits. His citation read: :Temporary Captain Francis Mansel Kitto, General List and R.F.C. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. While engaged in attacking ground targets with machine-gun fire and bombs he observed a large party of troops, amongst whom he dropped the remainder of his bombs with the most excellent results. On a later occasion he attacked a formation of enemy scouts, and having caused one of these to crash to the ground, he pursued another and attacked it eleven miles behind the enemy's lines, bringing it to the ground and destroying it. In addition to these he has shot down two other hostile machines, and has shown throughout, the greatest determination and dash.\\" Postwar career Kitto transferred to piloting Airco DH.9 bombers during 1919.Franks (2003), p.61.

Dutton. Summary It tells the story of brilliant financial speculator Henry M. Galt. Through his own vision and work ethic, Galt takes over the failing Great Midwestern Railroad during an economic crisis, turning it into a hugely productive and profitable asset for the benefit of himself and the rest of the nation. The novel begins against the backdrop of the panic of 1893 and the free silver movement when many real-life railroads went bankrupt. In large part due to Galt's efforts, the country's economy is restored. Galt's acquisitions and fortune continue to grow and he becomes the wealthiest person in America. Instead of celebration, there is envy and distrust among those who marvel at but fail to understand Galt's genius. His enemies, along with the federal government, set out to destroy Galt and topple the empire he has built. Possible Ayn Rand connection Justin Raimondo observed similarities between The Driver and Atlas Shrugged, a 1957 novel by Ayn Rand, which has a railroad executive as its main character and another character named John Galt. In contrast, Chris Matthew Sciabarra argued Raimondo's \\"claims that Rand plagiarized...The Driver\\" to be \\"unsupported\\", and Stephan Kinsella doubts that Rand was in any way influenced by Garrett. Writer Bruce Ramsey observed, \\"Both The Driver and Atlas Shrugged have to do with running railroads during an economic depression, and both suggest pro- capitalist ways in which the country might get out of the depression.

The area has grown and has become a major tourist center, with great infrastructure (shopping center, bars, shows, restaurants, nightclubs, hotels and pousadas ). It is also the residential beach area, where the largest number of residents who exceed 10,000. Today, many even say that Ingleses is a city and not a neighborhood. North of Praia dos Ingleses, is Praia Brava, and south, Praia do Santinho, also in Ingleses do Rio Vermelho district. Praia dos Ingleses means Beach of the Englishmen‚Äùin Portuguese. The beach's name is due to an English ship that ran aground there. There are two theories about the ship's fate. The first says that she floated and went her way, leaving some of the crew on the island. The other says that it sank.

Its goal is to measure or set a limit on the Œ∏13 mixing angle, a neutrino oscillation parameter responsible for changing electron neutrinos into other neutrinos. The experiment uses reactors of the Chooz Nuclear Power Plant as a neutrino source and measures the flux of neutrinos they receive. To accomplish this, Double Chooz has a set of two detectors situated 400 meters and 1050 meters from the reactors. Double Chooz is a successor to the Chooz experiment; one of its detectors occupies the same site as its predecessor. Until January 2015 all data has been collected using only the far detector. The near detector was completed in September 2014, after construction delays and is taking physics data since beginning of 2015.  Detector design  Double Chooz uses two identical Gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator detectors placed in vicinity of two 4.25 GW thermal power reactors to measure antineutrino disappearance. The two detectors are aptly referred to as \\"near\\", 400 meters from the reactor; and \\"far\\", 1,050 meters from the reactor. The far detector is placed inside a hill such that there is a 300 meters of water equivalent of shielding from cosmic muons. The detector itself is a calorimetric liquid scintillator consisting of four concentric cylindrical vessels. = Neutrino target and Œ≥-catcher = The innermost vessel is made of acrylic plastic and has a diameter of 230 cm, a height of 245.8 cm, and a thickness of 0.8 cm. This chamber is filled with 10,000 liters of gadolinium (Gd) loaded (1 gram/liter) liquid scintillator; it is the neutrino target. The next layer out is the Œ≥-catcher. It surrounds the neutrino target with a 55 cm thick layer of Gd-free liquid scintillator. The casing for the Œ≥-catcher is 12 cm thick and made of the same material as the neutrino catcher. The materials are chosen so that both of these vessels are transparent to photons with a wavelength greater than 400 nm. = Buffer vessel and PMTs = The buffer vessel is made of stainless steel 304L with dimensions of 552.2 cm wide by 568.0 cm tall and 0.3 cm thick. The remainder of the interior space that isn't occupied by the acrylic double vessel is filled with a non-scintillating mineral oil. On the inner surface of the buffer vessel are 390 10-inch photomultiplier tubes. The purpose of the buffer layer is to shield from radioactivity in the PMTs and the surrounding rock. These to layers in addition to the neutrino target and Œ≥-catcher are collectively referred to as the \\"inner detector.\\" =Inner and outer vetos= The inner veto surrounds the buffer vessel with a 50 cm thick layer of scintillating mineral oil. In addition, it has 78 8-inch PMTs distributed on the top, bottom and sides. This inner veto layer serves as an active veto layer for muons and fast neutrons. The surrounding 15 cm thick steel casing further serves to shield against external Œ≥-rays. The outer veto covers the top of the detector tank. It consists of strips with a 5 cm x 1 cm cross section laid in orthogonal directions. =Data collection= Signals from the inner detector and the inner veto are recorded by 8-bit flash ADC electronics with a sampling rate of 500 MHz. The trigger threshold for the detectors is set to 350 keV, much lower than the 1.02 MeV expected of the electron anti- neutrinos. For several years Double Chooz has operated with only the far detector and has used models such as Bugey4 to calculate the expected flux. The completed near detector will allow increased precision in the next years of data taking.  Experimental techniques  =Neutrino mixing= Neutrinos are electrically neutral, extremely light particles that only interact weakly, meaning they can travel vast distances without ever being noticed. One of the properties of neutrinos is that as the propagate they have a chance to oscillate from one flavor (e, \\\\mu, \\\\tau) to another, and this is the principle under which the experiment operates. The goal of Double Chooz is to more tightly constrain the value for the \\\\theta_{13} mixing angle. The Chooz experiment, performed in the 1990s, found that the \\\\theta_{13} mixing angle is constrained by : \\\\sin^2 (2\\\\theta_{13}) < 0.2 which was the best experimental upper limit for over a decade. The goal of the Double Chooz experiment is to continue to explore the \\\\theta_{13} angle by probing an even smaller region : 0.03 < \\\\sin^2 (2\\\\theta_{13}) < 0.2 Observations of the mixing angle are accomplished by observing the \\\\bar{ u}_{e} flux that comes off of the reactors during their fission reactions. The expected \\\\bar{ u}_{e} flux from the reactors is about 50 per day. Because one of the neutrino mass- squared differences is much smaller than the other, the Double Chooz experiment only needs to consider a two-flavor oscillation. In the two-flavor model the survival probability of any given neutrino is modelled by :P= 1 - \\\\sin^{2}(2\\\\theta_{13})\\\\, \\\\sin^{2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1.27\\\\Delta m^2_{31} L}{E_{ u}}\\\\right)\\\\quad \\\\mathrm{(in\\\\; natural\\\\; units).} Here L is the length in meters the neutrino has travelled and E_{ u} is the energy of the \\\\bar{ u}_{e} particle. From this the value of the mixing angle can be measured from the oscillation amplitude in reactor neutrino oscillations. =Observations= The neutrinos from the reactor are observed via the inverse beta decay (IBD) process :\\\\bar{ u}_e + p \\\\to e^+ + n. Since there are backgrounds to consider, candidates for (IBD) are determined by the following: visible energy from the prompt signal must be between 0.5 and 20 MeV; the delayed signal must have an energy between 4 and 10 MeV; the time difference between those two signals must be between 0.5 and 150 microseconds; the distance between the vertices of the two signals should be less than 100 cm; and no other signals (except for the delayed signal) are found 200 microseconds before or 600 microseconds after the prompt signal. Detection of the prompt signal has reached nearly 100% efficiency, however it is not as easy to detect the delayed signal due to issues such as Gd-concentration and neutron scattering models.  Results  =Mixing angle= In November 2011, first results of the experiment were presented at the LowNu conference in Seoul, hinting at a non-zero value of Œ∏13.Herve de Kerret, \\"First results from the Double Chooz experiment\\", talk at the LowNu conference, Seoul, November 2011, via: In a 2012 article using 228 days of data, Œ∏13 was measured and the no oscillation hypothesis was excluded at 2.9 sigma. Neutron capture on hydrogen was used to produce independent data, which was analysed to yield a separate measurement in 2013: : \\\\sin^2 (2\\\\theta_{13}) = 0.097\\\\pm 0.034 \\\\, \\\\mathrm{(stat)} \\\\pm 0.034\\\\, \\\\mathrm{(syst)}. Using reactor-off data, a background-independent measurement was published July 2014 in Physics Letters B: : \\\\sin^2 (2\\\\theta_{13}) = 0.102 \\\\pm 0.028 \\\\, \\\\mathrm{(stat)} \\\\pm 0.033\\\\, \\\\mathrm{(syst)}. An improved measurement with reduced background and systematic uncertainties after 467.90 days of data was published in the Journal of High Energy Physics in 2014: : \\\\sin^2 (2\\\\theta_{13}) = 0.090^{+0.032}_{-0.029}. =Other results= Double Chooz was able to identify positronium formation in their detector, which delays positron annihilation and distorts the scintillation signal. A tagging algorithm was developed that could be used in neutrino detectors for improved background rejection, which was similarly done by Borexino for cosmogenic 11C background. An ortho-positronium lifetime of was measured, compatible with other dedicated setups. Limits on Lorentz violation parameters were also set.

He is most famous for writing memoirs in favor of the 1917 October Revolution in Russia: he had been both a witness and a participant.  Early life  He was born in Greenwich, Ohio, on September 28, 1883, to David Thomas Williams, a Congregationalist minister, and Esther Rees (Rhys). Both of his parents were immigrants from Wales, Britain. All of Rhys's brothers (he was the second of four) followed in the footsteps of their father and became ministers. Of them, David Rhys Williams (one of two youngest) had a long and distinguished career in the Unitarian ministry. At the end of the 1880s the family settled in the New York State resort community. In 1897, Albert graduated from high school in Hancock, New York. Then, he worked for some time in a lumber yard in Apex, New York. Later, he moved to Ohio where he worked at a clothing store until he was old enough to enter college. In 1900, he went to a college in Marietta, Ohio, where he studied until 1904. At Marietta College, he made his first steps in journalism, being an editor of the college newspaper. Also, he helped to organize a union for retail clerks in Marietta. In 1904 to 1907 Williams studied at the Hartford Theological Seminary, having graduated it with a license to preach. There, he also edited a labor column for the Hartford Evening Post. With a preacher's license in the summer of 1907, Williams worked at the Settlement House of the Spring Street Presbyterian Church, in New York City. In New York, Rhys met Norman Thomas (later the Socialist Party presidential candidate), who was then a Presbyterian seminarian. In those years, they both organized men's club debates. In 1907 to 1908 Williams was studying on a fellowship at Cambridge University and the University of Marburg. There, he met members of the British Labour Party and other socialists. On his return to the United States, Williams worked for the 1908 presidential campaign of Socialist Eugene Debs. Then, Williams returned to his main profession as a minister of the Maverick Square Congregational Church in East Boston (1908 to 1914). However he did not abandon the labor and social issues at all. In 1912, Williams raised money and spoke up for the workers during the 1912 textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Williams first met John Reed, whose acquaintance played a role in his upcoming interest in Russia and then his trip to this far overseas country. World War I In 1914, however, upon outbreak of war in Europe, he went to Belgium, originally to perform relief work for civilian refugees. He later wrote a book about his early experiences during his stay in Belgium in 1914 was In the Claws of the German Eagle, published in 1917. He joined a group of British reporters and cameramen and recounted somewhat humorously how some so-called 'action-photos' were taken at the time: bored soldiers willingly posed for simulated scenes of fighting. He himself was posed as a 'German spy' and photographed. The photograph later got printed and was used worldwide in the printed media as an authentic picture. Soviet sympathizer In Russia, he met and conversed with Lenin on multiple occasions and stayed in the country until September 1918. Back in the United States, he worked as a pro-Soviet and Communist activist. Williams was appalled when President Woodrow Wilson sent troops in an attempt to defeat the Bolshevik government. \\"I never ceased to feel shame for the role my country played in this joint effort to strangle bolshevism in its cradle and socialism for good and all.\\" Williams volunteered to join the Red Army but Vladimir Lenin rejected the offer and said he was more important to him in the field of propaganda. He later wrote. \\"If I helped in some small way to mitigate the guilt of being an American, I am satisfied.\\" He went to the USSR in 1922 and stayed there until 1928. During his stay, he married Lucita Squier (in 1923). He visited the country again in 1930, 1937, and 1959. Meanwhile, he wrote a number of reports from his travels in the Soviet Union, as well as a book about the Russian Revolution, which was completed by his wife after his death. He maintained his pro-Soviet stance for the rest of his life. He died February 27, 1962. Works In the Claws of the German Eagle. New York, E.P.

In 1991, the Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker, devised a list of events not permitted to be broadcast solely on pay television services. The practice was placed on a statutory footing by the Broadcasting Act 1996, which required the ITC to create a permanent list of such events, dubbed the \\"crown jewels of sport\\".; In 1997, the initial list was drawn up, and was revised in 1999, where the code was divided into two categories, A and B. The code was further amended in 2000 to give the ITC responsibility over UK-based broadcasters wanting to transmit listed events in other countries.  Eligible broadcasters  Listed events may only be televised by eligible broadcasters, carrying a signal on a PSB multiplex on Freeview that covers at least 95% of the population, and must be carried by cable, satellite, and streaming IPTV services. As of July 2019, the eligible broadcasters are the BBC (including BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Four, BBC News, BBC Parliament, CBBC and CBeebies), ITV (including ITV2, ITV3, and ITV4), and Channel 4 (including Film4 and More4). Channel 5 is currently ineligible to broadcast listed events, as Ofcom deems that its My5 streaming services serve an insufficient number of platforms. Category A Category A events are events which must have live coverage made available to free-to-air channels, although pay television networks may share live coverage. As of 2000, these events are: Association football: *FIFA World Cup (all matches) *UEFA European Championship (all matches) *FA Cup Final * Scottish Cup Final (in Scotland only) Horse racing: *Grand National *Epsom Derby Rugby league: *Challenge Cup final Rugby union: *World Cup final Tennis: *Wimbledon Championships finals (both men's and women's) Multi-sport events: *Olympic Games (both summer and winter) *Paralympic Games (both summer and winter) Category B Category B events can be shown on pay television, provided sufficient secondary coverage (highlights, delayed broadcast, etc.) is made to free-to-air broadcasters.

During the 2019 Cricket World Cup, bowing to public pressure, Sky stated that it would sub-license the final to Channel 4 (who sub-licensed highlights rights) if England were to qualify. England would advance, and beat New Zealand to win the title, in one of the first top-flight cricket matches aired free-to-air since 2005. Following the tournament, renewed calls emerged for test matches and/or the Cricket World Cup to be added to Category A.  Proposed changes  =2009 review= In 2008 (in the lead-up to digital switchover), Ofcom began an independent review, led by David Davies, into the contents and organisation of the listed events criteria. On 30 July 2009, the BBC proposed that the list be expanded and reorganised to include a new \\"A1\\" category above the existing category A (renamed A3), designating that the event must be aired live in their entirety on free-to-air channels (such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro, and the Olympics), and \\"A2\\" for events seen as only important to one Home Nation and that must be broadcast in their entirety on free-to-air channels within said nation (such as the FA Cup final in England and the Scottish Cup final in Scotland). List A3 (requiring FTA highlights) would add the Cricket World Cup final and ICC World Twenty20 final, British and Irish Lions tours, and FIFA Women's World Cup, UEFA Women's Championship and Women's Cricket World Cup matches involving Home Nations. The Davies review panel recommended the abolition of Category B in its entirely, leaving a single slate of listed events that must be televised in their entirety on British FTA television unless otherwise noted, including the Summer Olympics, FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship, the FA Cup final (outside of Scotland), the Scottish Cup final (inside Scotland), the Rugby World Cup, the Grand National, and Wimbledon. It was also proposed that qualifying matches for Euro and the World Cup that involve Home Nations (within the participating nations), the Ashes home tests, and Wales matches at the Six Nations Championship (in Wales) be added to the list. The Epsom Derby, rugby league Challenge Cup final, and the Winter Olympics were removed under the proposal. = 2019‚Äì2020 changes = In July 2019, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Jeremy Wright announced a consultation on adding the FIFA Women's World Cup and Paralympic Games to Category A. The 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup was televised in its entirety by the BBC, with total viewership of 28.1 million across the entire tournament. In September 2019, Wright's successor Nicky Morgan stated that she had begun to seek input with rightsholders on adding more women's sporting events to category A, in order to place them on \\"equal footing\\" with their men's counterparts. She was also pursuing updates to the listed event rules to account for changes in viewer habits prompted by digital platforms. The summer and winter Paralympics were added to Category A in January 2020; The Times reported a final decision on the FIFA Women's World Cup and UEFA European Women's Championship is to come in the future, but both events are likely to see inclusion. The government declined to add the Ashes, the UEFA Champions League Final, and the Open Championship to the list. In March 2020, BBC director-general Tony Hall called for the Six Nations Championship to be promoted to Category A, amid reports that the competition was seeking to include a pay television component (or otherwise sign exclusively with a pay television broadcaster) in its broadcast contract for 2022 onward. The Six Nations is currently divided between the BBC and ITV, airing FTA in its entirety. An associated proposal by the committee of DCMS was rejected.

However, Massachusetts has two kinds of charter schools - Commonwealth Charters and Horace Mann Charters. Horace Mann charter schools differ from Commonwealth charter schools as they must be located within a school district. Both kinds of charter schools are free to structure their curriculum and school environment; for instance, many charter schools fit more instructional hours into a year by running longer school days and providing instruction on weekends and during the summer. Because few charter schools are unionized, they can hire and fire teachers and administrative staff without regard to the collectively bargained seniority and tenure provisions that constrain such decisions in most public schools. Although charter students made up only 2.9 percent of U.S. public school enrollment in 2008‚Äì2009, charter enrollment has grown rapidly and seems likely to accelerate in the near future. The growth of charter schools is an important component of the contemporary education reform movement's pursuit of accountability and flexibility in public education. Proponents see charter schools' freedom from regulation as a source of educational innovation, with the added benefit of providing a source of competition that may prompt innovation and improvement in the rest of the public system. At the same time, charter schools are controversial because, after a transition period in which the state provides subsidies, they receive a tuition payment for each enrolled student paid by students' home districts. In Massachusetts, tuition payments are determined largely by the average per-pupil expenditure in sending districts. Not surprisingly, therefore, public school districts are concerned about the revenue lost when their students enroll in charter schools. There are 78 charter schools operating in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts during the 2016‚Äì2017 academic year. Individual school profiles are available at the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. In 2015, 40,200 students were enrolled in Massachusetts charter schools representing 4.5% of the total public school enrollment, with another 32,600 students on wait lists to attend one. Overview of Charter Schools in Massachusetts The 1993 Massachusetts Education Reform Act opened the door to charter schools in Massachusetts. Non-profit organizations, universities, teachers and parents can apply to the state's Board of Elementary and Secondary Education for a charter (there are no for-profit charter schools in Massachusetts). Massachusetts charter schools are generally managed by a board of trustees and are independent of local school committees. Like other public schools, charter schools charge no tuition and are funded mostly by sending districts according to formulas set by the state. Massachusetts charter schools have a number of organizational features in common with charter schools in other states. First, they are typically outside local collective bargaining agreements. As a result, they have greater flexibility than traditional public schools when it comes to staffing, compensation, and scheduling. The increased freedom coupled with increased accountability infuses all aspects of the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education's oversight of charter schools, beginning with the rigorous application process that groups must go through to receive a charter. Once the Board of Education has awarded a charter on the basis of a successful Application for a Public School Charter (step 1), the new charter school has the freedom to organize around the core mission, curriculum, theme, or teaching method described in the application. It is allowed to control its own budget and hire (and fire) teachers and staff. In return for this freedom, a charter school must demonstrate good results within five years or risk losing its charter. The Board of Education is obligated by Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 71, Section 89, and regulations under 603 CMR 1.00 to conduct an ongoing review of charter schools and, by the fifth year of a school's operation, decide whether its charter should be renewed. Specifically, the renewal of a public school charter is based on affirmative information in three areas of inquiry: #Academic program success #Organizational viability #Faithful to the terms of the charter The State Board of Education authorizes two types of charter schools: Commonwealth charters are those approved directly by the state board; Horace Mann charters are normally conversion schools approved by the school board and teachers union before state approval. The current regulations on charter schools, put in place by the Education Reform Act of 1993, include several restrictions including: *No more than 9 percent of a school district's spending can go to a charter school; 72 Commonwealth charters and 48 Horace Mann charters allowed *The number of charter schools in the state is limited to 120. *A maximum of 4 percent of the state's student population may be enrolled in charter schools. *The first three charter school approvals every year must be in schools districts with average or below average performance on statewide standardized tests. In the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, 26,384 Massachusetts students attended 62 operating charter schools, including 16 in Boston. State law caps the number of charter schools at 72, and total enrollment at 30,034, so the statewide charter cap is not a constraint. However, a provision limiting local charter spending to nine percent of the district total generates binding or near- binding caps in specific districts, including Boston, where charter enrollment is already relatively high. The question of whether this local cap should be lifted is currently the subject of intense debate, fueled in part by the availability of federal stimulus money for states that facilitate new charters. In 2009, Governor Deval Patrick proposed to increase the funding restriction from 9 percent to 18 percent in 30 of the state's lowest performing districts. In Central Massachusetts, the districts in that group include: Southbridge, Worcester, Winchendon, Webster, Fitchburg, Athol- Royalson, North Brookfield and Gardner. In 2011, the state's education commissioner has recommended 17 charter schools (14 Commonwealth charter schools and 3 Horace Mann)‚Äî including 10 in Boston ‚Äî be granted charters by the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. In the November 2016 state election, there was a proposal to lift the cap on charters, which was supported by Governor Charlie Baker and The Boston Globe. Some of the other issues associated with this question included the alleged increased financial cost of municipalities, and the principle of local control. This measure was soundly defeated. Charter school accountability The state Charter School Office reviews and makes recommendations on charter applications, reviews the performance of existing charter schools, and decides whether charters should be renewed. Charter schools are held accountable via annual reports, financial audits, and site visits, and are required to file for renewal every five years. Renewal applications must show that a school's academic program is successful, that the school is a viable organization, and that it has been faithful to its charter. Since 1994, the state has received a total of 350 charter applications and has granted 76. Nine of the 76 Massachusetts charters ever granted were surrendered or revoked as of 2009. =Approval process= The Massachusetts charter school law states that any person, group, or entity may apply for a public school charter, with the exception of for-profit companies and private schools. In applying for a charter, the school's founders must submit an application detailing why the school should be granted a charter. The application details must include the school's vision, educational philosophy, curriculum, assessment plans, structure, governance, management, facilities, transportation, and student population, including its plans for serving special student groups. The final application is followed by intensive reviews from a state panel and the local school district, as well as public hearings and interviews with the applicants and the school's proposed board of trustees. After gathering feedback and documentation from all parties, the Commissioner of Education makes recommendations to the Board of Education, which makes the final decision. The process for gaining charter approval in Massachusetts is nationally recognized as being extremely rigorous. The Center for Education Reform‚Äôs annual report on the strength of charter school laws ranks Massachusetts sixth out of 41. In 2003, the Thomas B. Fordham Institute published a comprehensive study on the quality of states‚Äô charter authorization processes, in which Massachusetts‚Äô authorization process was ranked first in the nation:‚ÄúMassachusetts has in place comprehensive application review and oversight processes. For new schools, it now involves an approval cycle that lasts nearly two years from initial application to school opening.‚Äù =Academic performance= Charter schools must follow the same state educational standards, administer the same state tests, and abide by the same laws and regulations as other public schools in the Commonwealth. A charter school application itself serves as the first stage of public accountability, as it is used to determine if the school has been faithful to the charter, particularly with respect to its core mission, academic programs, financial integrity, and record of student achievement. The record on the accountability of Massachusetts charter schools is strong (and stronger than that of district schools). Like all public schools in the Commonwealth, charter schools must administer the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) tests. Most charter schools supplement MCAS test performance data with results from other nationally recognized standardized tests, such as the SAT 10, ITBS, or TerraNova. Results from all assessments are used in the charter school accountability process and are central in evaluating whether a school is an academic success. In 2005, a higher percentage of students in charter schools scored proficient or advanced on all 10 MCAS tests compared with their districts‚Äî9.2 percent, 8.7 percent, and 8.3 percent higher in English, math, and science, respectively. *In Boston, 15 percent, 12 percent, and 12 percent more students achieved proficiency in English, math, and science, respectively, in charter schools than in district schools. *In Worcester, 16 percent, 8.5 percent, and 7.5 percent more students achieved proficiency in English, math, and science, respectively, in charter schools than in district schools. *In Springfield, 19 percent, 26 percent, and 6 percent more students achieved proficiency in English, math, and science, respectively, in charter schools than in district schools. 2010 MCAS results for all Massachusetts schools and districts is available at the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. It's important to note thought that because of the lottery system, charter schools do not get any transient students, have more dedicated parents, more stable home lives, and have much lower percentages of disavantaged students. For example: * Greenfield MA, 45.6% economically disadvantaged (poor) students while their local charter School (Four Rivers Charter School) has 25.8% * Hilltown Charter has 6.6% disadvantaged while the town it's in (Easthampton) has 22%. =Evaluation= Charter schools must submit an Accountability Plan that establishes ‚Äúspecific five-year performance objectives to measure the school‚Äôs progress and success in raising student achievement, establishing a viable organization, and fulfilling the terms of its charter.‚Äù No such plan is currently required of traditional district schools unless they are ‚Äòunderperforming.‚Äô The Department of Education conducts also annual site visits for every charter school. In addition, after the conclusion of each academic year, a charter school must submit a publicly released Annual Report to the Department of Education that documents the school's most recent activities. This document specifically reports the school's performance record in accordance with the objectives and methods of measuring achievement found in its Accountability Plan. Both of these documents, the Accountability Plan and the Annual Report, are unique to charter schools and are not required of traditional public schools in the state. The following are the rules for charter schools in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: *Charter schools may not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, creed, sex, ethnicity, sexual orientation, mental or physical disability, age, ancestry, athletic performance, special need, or proficiency in the English language or a foreign language, or academic achievement. *Charter schools must provide special education services, English language instruction, and other special services to meet the needs of their students. *Charter schools may not charge an application fee, or charge tuition or fees for required educational programs. *Charter schools may not give an entrance exam, or otherwise test applicants for aptitude or knowledge before admission. *Charter schools must give preference to students who live in their districts. *Charter schools can decide which grade levels they want to include. *Students who enroll in charter schools can withdraw at any time and attend local district schools in their city or town. =Revoking charters= When charter schools do not perform to expectations, they are closed. Charter school closures are believed to be the evidence of accountability in action. As of February 2009, only six Massachusetts charters had ever been closed (Boston University Residential Charter School, Frederick Douglass Charter School, Lynn Community Charter School, North Star Academy Charter School, Roxbury Charter High School and YouthBuild) - half of those were closed for academic deficiencies. =Teacher retention= Massachusetts is believed to have an exceptionally high number of qualified teachers who are educated from top universities. This is another reason why charter schools that don't require teacher certification are able to hire and retain young, intelligent teachers. Teachers in Massachusetts charter schools tend to be significantly younger than teachers in either traditional or pilot schools in the Commonwealth. Sixty-eight percent of faculty members in charter schools are under the age of 32 while less than half of the faculty in traditional and pilot schools fall in this age bracket. Meanwhile, less than 10% of staff in charter schools are over the age of 49, compared to 41% and 24% of staff in traditional and pilot schools, respectively. However, a 2009 study of charter school staffing by Stuit and Smith examined how teacher turnover differed between charter and traditional schools. The study found that charter schools had a teacher turnover rate of 25% while the rate at traditional public schools was 14%. One of the reasons could be the greater autonomy charter schools have in hiring and laying off their staff. Nearly all charter schools in Massachusetts indicated that they are able to remove teachers who either do not meet their school's performance standards or do not fit the needs of the school and students, compared to 36% of traditional schools that felt they were able to remove teachers who did not meet the school's performance standards. The other reason could be the salary and the benefits of teachers in charter schools. Salary and benefits are the primary tools used to attract teachers to work in traditional and pilot schools while charter school principals report that school reputation is an important way to convince teachers to join their faculty. When asked about which factors attract qualified teacher candidates to their school, all of the traditional schools principals and over 80% of the pilot school principals agreed that level of salary and benefits offered helped to attract candidates. Meanwhile, only 28% of charter school principals agreed that the level of salary and benefits helped to attract candidates, whereas nearly 90% agreed that the reputation of their school helped to attract candidates. This is not surprising considering that the average teacher salary in the 2006‚Äê07 school year in Boston Public Schools (traditional and pilot) was approximately $71,000 and for Boston charter schools it was $48,600. =Union representation= Charter school finance A basic premise of charter school reform in public education is offering more autonomy in the use of funds and the design of curriculum in exchange for greater accountability in academic and financial outcomes. This premise poses a significant policy challenge for state policymakers to establish an appropriate level of regulation; charter schools must be sufficiently independent yet still conform to most state and federal education and financial management laws. In crafting legislation, state policymakers strive to strike a balance between creating an overly prescriptive charter law and failing to sufficiently safeguard public investments. Management and oversight of public funds is a serious responsibility. Exercising this responsibility includes monitoring the appropriate use of funds and implementing consequences for financial mismanagement that range from interventions to school closure. =Tuition and State Funding= =Foundations and grants= Charter schools often will operate a school foundation (501c-3) as well as a general fund. The foundation is set up to fund extra operating expenses of the school beyond the state funding. The foundations generally rely on donations from a variety of sources. If the foundation owns the school building and has positive operating funds, the state cannot claim ownership in the case of revocation of a school's charter- if a foundation is not in place, the building and all assets can be taken over by the state. The following law is MA charter law, 603 CMR 1.00: (8) Upon the revocation, non-renewal, or voluntary return of a Commonwealth charter, title to all of the property of the charter school shall immediately vest in the Commonwealth, subject to the rights of any secured party holding a perfected security interest in the property of such charter school. Any funds remaining after the satisfaction of the charter school's obligations shall be deposited in the General Fund. 603 CMR 1.13(8) shall not apply to the extent the charter school or any other interested party demonstrates that charter school property was purchased solely by, or solely with funds paid to the school by, persons or entities other than the Commonwealth, in which case ownership of the property shall be transferred to such persons or entities, unless otherwise voted by the board of trustees. (9) Upon the revocation, non-renewal, or voluntary return of a Horace Mann charter, title to all of the property of the charter school shall immediately vest in the school district in which the school is located, subject to the rights of any secured party holding a perfected security interest in the property of such charter school. 603 CMR 1.13(9) shall not apply to the extent the charter school or any other interested party demonstrates that charter school property was purchased solely by, or solely with funds paid to the school by, persons or entities other than the district or Commonwealth, in which case ownership of the property shall be transferred to such persons or entities, unless otherwise voted by the board of trustees. =Financing Facilities= Admission lottery Each charter school collects applications and holds its own lottery in years the school is over-subscribed. Siblings of students already attending the school are guaranteed a seat, as are students continuing on from earlier grades. Students can apply to as many charter schools as they like; the lotteries are statistically and administratively independent. Students may therefore be accepted or wait-listed at more than one school. When admitted students decline, slots open up for additional offers farther down the lottery list. Thus, some students may be offered spots immediately, while others may be offered seats closer to the beginning of the school year. Charter school lottery records were matched to MCAS and SIMS data using applicants' names and year and grade of application.

Sudan has experienced two civil wars since 1955, the second of which lasted 22 years. During this time, the U.S. was the largest provider of foreign aid to Sudan, largely focused on humanitarian aid through the U.S. Agency for International Development. Sudan is listed as the U.S. government's highest priority in Africa due to \\"its importance for counter-terrorism and regional stability, as well as the magnitude of human rights and humanitarian abuses\\" U.S. foreign aid to Sudan has begun to see some positive indicators of performance although critical reaction has said that aid to Sudan is neither strategic nor focused. Location of Sudan in Africa U.S. foreign aid overview =History= In 1961 Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act, which separated the U.S.'s non-military and military foreign assistance programs. As part of the Act, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was created. This act was passed in the wake of the Marshall Plan, in which the U.S. provided aid to European countries devastated as a result of World War II. President John F. Kennedy supported the creation of USAID based on three tenets: #Current foreign aid programs were ill-equipped to meet the needs of the U.S. and developing countries. #Allowing developing countries' economies to collapse would be \\"disastrous to our national security, harmful to our comparative prosperity, and offensive to our conscience.\\" #The 1960s was considered to be a good time for developed countries to assist developing countries. =Current allocation to Sudan= According to the U.S. embassy in Chad, there are three key U.S. strategic objectives in Sudan: # A definitive end to conflict, gross human rights abuses, and genocide in Darfur # Implementation of the north-south CPA that results in a peaceful post-2011 Sudan, or an orderly path toward two separate and viable states at peace with each other # Ensure that Sudan does not provide a safe haven for international terrorists The bulk of U.S. foreign aid to Sudan should, as a result, pertain to one or more of these objectives. The U.S. also wants to encourage local governments to be more active in assisting its people in reaching these objectives. As of 2010 the current allocation of U.S. foreign aid from USAID to Sudan is $420,349,319. The U.S. had been involved with foreign aid to Sudan for many years. They gave close to $270 million between 1977‚Äì1981 and were Sudan's largest source of foreign aid by 1984. In the mid-1980s the U.S. provided Sudan with food aid, insecticides, and fertilizers. When Sudan failed to repay loans in 1985, the U.S. ceased all non-food aid. USAID continued to provide humanitarian assistance through 1991. Since 2005 the U.S. government has contributed upwards of $8 billion in humanitarian aid as food aid, health care provisions, water, sanitation, and hygiene. They have also given money towards nutrition, agriculture, protection, and economic recovery programs. A large portion of this funding is through USAID, which funds solely through bilateral programs rather than pooling efforts within multilateral organizations. Programs Visual identity of USAID. The logo is on the left and the brand mark on the right. USAID focuses on six main areas of development in Sudan. =Humanitarian assistance= USAID funds activities which support the CPA, long-term recovery, and a transition to a more peaceful and secure nation. USAID has been active in Darfur since 2004. $127.6 million for water sanitation, hygiene, health, shelter, and infrastructure was provided to Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad in 2009. =Food aid= USAID has been Sudan's largest food aid donor since 2004. USAID provides an annual $30 million for a multi- year food aid development program as well as almost $680 million in emergency food aid. Darfur, displaced peoples and returnees, basic services, and food security are USAID's priorities. =Peace and security= A goal of USAID in Sudan is to build local Sudanese capacity to address the causes and effects of political conflict, violence, and instability. USAID wants to strengthen consensus-building through political processes. Civil and community organizations in Darfur are also supported. =Governing justly and democratically= USAID supports the CPA's core political processes. It strengthens the systems to meet the needs of citizens and government, as well as developing governmental priorities at multiple levels. In southern Sudan and three other areas, USAID assists with governmental transparency and increasing incomes. It also support elections, consultations, and referenda. A major goal is to promote participation in the civic process, consensus building, and international observation. =Investing in people= USAID focuses on health by supporting mother and child health services and reducing the impact of HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases. It supports training medical officers to increase access to health care and immunizations. To support education, it trains teachers, improves schools, and encourages parent participation in education. USAID also promotes education for girls. =Economic growth= By improving infrastructure and connections from isolated communities, USAID creates a more favorable environment for market development. Improved land management for areas rich in biodiversity is also a focus. U.S. policy on conflict mitigation and reconciliation =History of funding for the program= Funding from 2006‚Äì2011 In 2005 USAID reported on its Sudanese funding strategy. Sudan is the U.S. government's highest priority in Africa due to \\"its importance for counter-terrorism and regional stability, as well as the magnitude of human rights and humanitarian abuses\\". This explains the high level of U.S. funding, particularly within the peace and security sector, during the years immediately after the 2005 signing of the CPA in Sudan. The U.S. government's priority was to assist in the implementation of the agreement, as Sudan's ability to achieve stability rested primarily on the CPA. Since 2007, of the $144.71 million of U.S. funding allocated towards conflict mitigation and reconciliation in Sudan, $141.77 million has gone towards the Economic Support Fund. USAID states the following as key objectives for the Economic Support Fund: * Supporting strategically significant friends and allies through assistance designed to increase the role of the private sector in the economy, reduce government controls over markets, enhance job creation, and improve economic growth * Developing and strengthening institutions necessary for sustainable democracy. Typical areas of assistance include technical assistance to administer and monitor elections, capacity building for non- governmental organizations, judicial training, and women's participation in politics. Assistance is also provided to support the transformation of the public sector to encourage democratic development, including training to improve public administration, promote decentralization, and strengthen local governments, parliaments, independent media and non-governmental organizations. * Strengthening the capacity to manage the human dimension of the transition to democracy and a market economy and to help sustain the neediest sectors of the population during the transition period One use for these funds is to \\"assist countries and regions at risk of civil unrest by helping these countries fight poverty, build democratic institutions to guarantee human rights, and provide basic services and economic opportunities to their populations.\\" As Sudan falls under this description for \\"at-risk states\\", the Economic Support Fund will specifically help Sudan implement the CPA and support peace processes in Darfur. Overall U.S. funding for foreign aid to Sudan has decreased from $924.1 million in 2009 to $427.8 million in 2010, with the department requesting $440.0 million in 2011. Of this funding, the amount allocated towards conflict mitigation and reconciliation in Sudan has fluctuated dramatically in recent years. U.S. funding for conflict mitigation and reconciliation within Sudan falls under the umbrella of peace and security funding, which is primarily administered by USAID and the United States Department of State. USAID defines its work for peace and security in Sudan in the following way: \\"USAID works to strengthen Sudanese capacity to address the causes and consequences of political conflict, violence, and instability. This includes building the capacity of local authorities to deliver peace dividends and enforce the rule of law. USAID also assists existing mechanisms that support consensus-building through key political processes to mitigate potentially catalytic conflicts. In Darfur, USAID supports civil society and community organizations in early recovery and peace-building activities\\". =Results= The U.S. Department of State has a list of performance indicators used to determine the value of funding towards peace and security objectives. The information used to assess performance is attained by Department of State agencies, its partners, and multilateral global bodies such as the United Nations and the World Bank. Because of the integrated approach to Sudanese funding from the U.S. and the global community as a whole, it is challenging to attribute specific results to U.S. funding for conflict mitigation and reconciliation in Sudan. As program evaluations have become a higher priority for the U.S. government, quantifiable program results are beginning to appear. In 2008 USAID funding towards Peace and Security in Sudan resulted in the following: * strengthening 38 formal and informal peace-building and community-strengthening networks in Darfur, including neighborhood youth associations * engagement of 102,407 people in community-based reconciliation projects throughout northern Sudan * construction of six early warning posts in volatile areas of the Greater Upper Nile =Reactions= The impact of U.S. aid to Sudan has been a controversial topic. A June 2010 USAID report stated \\"capacity building efforts in Southern Sudan are currently neither strategic nor focused. With few exceptions, the objectives are sweeping, unspecific, detached from actual performance, impossible to measure, and thus unlikely to succeed\\". One claim is that the capacity of the governmental bodies within Sudan are not enough to effectively use such funding. Aid money is either not provided where expected or used ineffectively and is therefore mostly wasted. Flag of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army Although not specifically linked to U.S. funding for conflict mitigation and reconciliation, one criticism of U.S. foreign aid towards Sudan has been in the use of such funding to provide assistance towards the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which enlists child soldiers. As of December 2009, the SPLA included around 1,200 children‚Äîboth boys and girls‚Äîaged between 12 and 17 years old.

In 1919 he began playing at the Fifty-Sixth Street Theater. He became the premiere theatre organist in the Philadelphia area for decades, earning the nickname ‚ÄúMelody Mac‚Äù. MacClain was also popular on radio, where he had his own show. In 1935 he debuted an instrument called the ‚ÄúPhotona‚Äù on the CBS Radio network.

The administrative center was in Murmansk. Proposals to change the administrative-territorial structure =1921= At the time of its creation, the governorate was administratively divided into nine volosts and had three cities and towns. However, just one month after the creation of the governorate, a new project of the administrative-territorial division was proposed at the First Congress of the Governorate Soviets. According to the project, the governorate's territory was to be divided into four uyezds: *Murmansky, which was to cover the eastern coast of the Arctic Ocean up to the Yokanga River, the area of the Kola Bay excluding Alexandrovsk, and all the areas adjacent to the railroad; *Ledovity, which was to include the western part of the Murman coast, bordering Finland in the west and Kolsko-Loparskaya Volost in the south; *Kolsky, which would include the territory of Kolsko- Loparskaya Volost; *Tersky, which would include the territories of Kuzomenskaya, Ponoyskaya, Tetrinskaya, and Umbskaya Volosts and have the administrative center in Kuzomen. The proposal, however, was shelved and a special commission was appointed to study the possibilities of changing the administrative-territorial structure of the governorate. =1922‚Äì1924= By 1922, the Murmansk Governorate Statistics Bureau and the Economics Council of the Governorate jointly developed a new project of the division of the governorate into districts. The districts were delineated using the economic principles and included: *Oceanic fishing-based, which consisted of two areas‚Äîthe western coast of the Kola Peninsula (Alexandrovskaya and Novozerskaya Volosts) and the eastern coast (Teriberskaya Volost)‚Äîand had its administrative center in Murmansk. The division into the western and eastern areas took into the consideration the ethnic composition of the population‚Äîthe population of the western coast was predominantly Finnish while that of the eastern coast was mostly Russian. *Sea fishing-based, located on the coast of the White Sea south of the Ponoy River. Administratively, it included the territories of Kuzomenskaya, Tetrinskaya, and Umbskaya Volosts. It was also proposed to transfer the eastern portion of Kandalakshskaya Volost of Kemsky Uyezd of Arkhangelsk Governorate to this district, and to make Kandalaksha its administrative center, as the volost's populace voted in 1921 to transfer the volost to Murmansky Uyezd and that de facto they were paying taxes to the Murmansk Department of Finance. *Timber industry-based, on the territory of Kolsko-Loparskaya Volost. As the territory of the proposed district was to be quite large, it was suggested that it is to be further subdivided into the northern and southern areas. *Reindeer herding-based, on the territory of Lovozerskaya and Ponoyskaya Volosts. This district was also proposed to be subdivided into two areas: western (all of Lovozerskaya Volost and the territory of Ponoyskaya Volost in the upper streams of the Ponoy River with the administrative center in Lovozero) and eastern (the remaining territory of Ponoyskaya Volost with the administrative center in Ponoy). Reindeer herding was to play major role in the western area, whereas the eastern area, while having some of reindeer herding activity of its own, would primarily specialize in fur trade. *The fifth district (Belomorsky) was supposed to shape the borders of the governorate more neatly. It was to be composed of the part of the territory of Kemsky Uyezd of the Karelian Labor Commune and of Onezhsky Uyezd of Arkhangelsk Governorate. The district was to be divided into two sub-districts: Kemsko-Sorotsky (comprising Kemskaya, Keretskaya, Kovdskaya, Pongomskaya, Pudozhemskaya, Sorotskaya, and Vychetaybolskaya Volosts of Kemsky Uyezd; with the administrative center in Soroka) and Onezhsky (comprising Kolchachinskaya, Koledomskaya, Kusheretskaya, Lapinskaya, Maloshuyskaya, Nimencheskaya, Nyukhotskaya, Sumskaya, and Vorzogorskaya Volosts, as well as Podporozhskaya Volost with the town of Onega, southwestern portion of Kokorinskaya Volost, and western portions of Mardinskaya, Navolotskaya, Piyalskaya, Posadno-Kirillovskaya, and Prilutskaya Volosts of Onezhsky Uyezd; with the administrative center in Onega). The project was approved at the session of the Murmansk Governorate Economic Conference on January 2, 1923 and sent for further consideration to the North-Western Economic Conference in Petrograd. There, however, the project was declined, and in 1924 the Murmansk Governorate Planning Commission developed yet another plan to divide the governorate into districts. The new plan proposed only minor changes to the volost borders. However, it again included a provision to transfer Kandalakshskaya Volost from the Karelian ASSR (into which the Karelian Labor Commune was transformed in 1923) to Murmansk Governorate; as this merger was approved by the volost population once again during the peasant conference on February 10, 1924. The plan was approved by the Presidium of the Murmansk Governorate Executive Committee on July 8, 1924 and forwarded to the administrative commission of the VTsIK. While the VTsIK approved the transfer of some inhabited localities between the volosts; in general the plan was declined and Kandalakshskaya Volost remained a part of the Karelian ASSR. =1925‚Äì1927= On January 12, 1925 the VTsIK suspended all work on the changes to the administrative-territorial divisions of the territory of the RSFSR in order to re-group and to improve planning. No changes were proposed until October 16, 1925, when at the Murmansk Governorate Commission meeting work on compiling the lists of the urban and rural localities was initiated. The commission categorized Murmansk, Alexandrovsk, and Kola as urban; however, a recommendation was sent to the VTsIK to demote the latter two to rural localities due to economic conditions, sparse population, low trade volume, lack of industrial enterprises, and \\"general regress\\". On March 15, 1926, the VTsIK approved the recommendation, and Murmansk remained the only town on the governorate's territory, while Alexandrovsk and Kola were re-categorized as rural. The work on the redistricting of the governorate resumed in spring 1926, for which purpose a special Redistricting Commission had been established. At the first meeting on May 17, 1926, the commission decided to transform the governorate into an okrug and suggested two possible redistricting schemes. The first scheme suggested the creation of eight districts with the administrative centers in Alexandrovsk, Kandalaksha, Kola, Kuzomen, Lovozero, Ponoy, Teriberka, and Umba. The other scheme suggested six districts: Alexandrovsky (with the administrative center in Alexandrovsk), Kolsko-Loparsky (Kola), Kandalakshsko- Umbsky (Kandalaksha), Tersky (Kuzomen), Lovozersky (Lovozero), and Teribersky (Teriberka). Both scheme assumed the transfer of Kandalakshskaya Volost to the okrug, so the third scheme, without such a merger, was also proposed as an alternative. By the summer of 1926, two redistricting projects were refined and offered for consideration. The first project suggested the replacement of the existing nine volosts with six districts, each of which would have a certain economic specialization: *Zapadny Murmansky, with the administrative center in Alexandrovsk and including the territories of Novozerskaya and Alexandrovskaya Volosts (the latter without Minkinsky Selsoviet). Its specialization was cod fishing. This district was the only one where the ethnic composition of the population was taken into consideration. *Vostochny Murmansky, with the administrative center in Teriberka and including the territory of Teriberskaya Volost. This district's specialization also was cod fishing. *Lovozersky, with the administrative center in Lovozero and including the territory of Lovozerskaya Volost. The specialization of this district was deer herding and related industries. *Kolsky, with the administrative center in Kola and including the territories of Kolsko-Loparskaya Volost and Minkinsky Selsoviet of Alexandrovskaya Volost. The district's industries were mixed, and included deer herding, fresh water fishing, as well as forest and railroad industries. *Tersky, with the administrative center in Kuzomen and including the territories of Kuzomenskaya, Tetrinskaya, and Umbskaya Volosts. The district specialized mainly in salmon fishing. *Ponoysky, with the administrative center in Ponoy and including the territory of Ponoyskaya Volost. Despite the fact that the economic activity in this district was similar in nature to Lovozersky and Tersky Districts', Ponoysky District was still to be a separate entity due to its size and remoteness from the administrative centers of other districts. The second project suggested the incorporation of Kandalakshskaya Volost into the okrug, which would become a separate Kandalakshsky District with the administrative center in Kandalaksha and including additionally the territory of Umbskaya Volost and the southern portion of Kolsko-Loparskaya Volost, namely Yona-Babinsky Selsoviet and a part of Ekostrovsky Selsoviet; the joint territory was then to be divided into three new selsoviets (Babinsky, Khibinsky, and Yensky). Other differences from the first project included the creation of Kuzomensky District with the administrative center in Kuzomen and including the territories of Kuzomenskaya and Tetrinskaya Volosts (as opposed to larger Tersky District suggested by the first project) and a smaller Kolsky District, which, compared to the first project, would cede its southern portion to Kandalakshsky District. The chairs of the volost executive commissions approved the first project during their meeting on June 25, 1926, but the extended Murmansk Governorate Redistricting Commission made several amendments on July 14, 1926. The names of proposed districts were changed from Zapadny Murmansky to Alexandrovsky, from Vostochny Murmansky to Teribersky, and from Kolsky to Kolsko-Loparsky. Furthermore, Iokangsky Selsoviet of Ponoyskaya Volost was to be included into Teribersky District, and Pyalitsky Selsoviet of Tetrinskaya Volost‚Äîinto Ponoysky District. The Presidium of the Murmansk Governorate Executive Commission approved this amended project on July 19, 1926, and the Plenary Session of the Murmansk Governorate Executive Commission and the members of the Murmansk City Soviet followed suit on August 3, 1926. However, on April 18, 1927 the Presidium of the Murmansk Governorate Executive Commission changed the scheme yet again, increasing the number of districts to seven: *Kolsko-Loparsky, on the territory of Kolsko-Loparskaya Volost and Minkinsky Selsoviet of Alexandrovskaya Volost; *Alexandrovsky, on the territories of Novozerskaya and Alexandrovskaya Volosts; the latter without Minkinsky Selsoviet; *Teribersky, on the territory of Teriberskaya Volost; *Ponoysky, on the territory of Ponoyskaya Volost; *Tersky, on the territories of Kuzomenskaya and Tetrinskaya Volosts; *Umbsky, on the territory of Umbskaya Volost; *Lovozersky, on the territory of Lovozerskaya Volost. The Presidium revised and approved this scheme one last time on May 23, 1927; the number of districts was again reduced to six‚ÄîUmbsky District was taken off the list with the territory of Umbskaya Volost to be included into Tersky District instead. Transformation On August 1, 1927, the VTsIK issued two Resolutions: \\"On the Establishment of Leningrad Oblast\\" and \\"On the Borders and Composition of the Okrugs of Leningrad Oblast\\". Murmansk Governorate was transformed into Murmansk Okrug (which was divided into six districts) and included into Leningrad Oblast. Karelian border issue Until 1923, the border between Murmansk Governorate and the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was the same as the border between the historical Kemsky and Kolsky Uyezds of Arkhangelsk Governorate established in 1857.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 41‚Äì42 Consequently, all of the populated places in the south of Kolsko-Loparskaya Volost were unambiguously a part of Murmansk Governorate. This changed in 1923, when the usage rights for two forest divisions in the south of Murmansk Governorate were passed to the colonization department of the Murman Railway. Since the forest divisions' territories were located in both Murmansk Governorate and the Karelian ASSR, for convenience purposes the colonization department's maps showed the Kandalaksha Forest Division as being entirely on the territory of the Karelian ASSR, which in practice meant that the map showed several inhabited localities of Ekostrovsky Selsoviet of Kolsko-Loparskaya Volost of Murmansk Governorate as being located on the territory of the Karelian ASSR. The governorate's documents, however, continued to list these inhabited localities as being a part of Ekostrovsky Selsoviet. Later, when the NKVD was creating maps for its own use, it used the colonization department's map as a basis, and the resulting map was used by the NKVD for official purposes. The Murmansk Governorate Executive Committee pointed out this discrepancy on several occasions, but the problem was not resolved by the time the governorate was transformed into an okrug.

Publication history The chapters titled \\"The Courts of the Conjurer\\" and \\"Ghosts of Stone\\" originally appeared, in a different form, as \\"The Pillars of Chambalor\\" and \\"The Silk of Shaitan\\" in the magazine Fantastic Stories v. 14, no. 3 (March 1965) and no. 4 (April 1965), respectively. The April 1965 issue featured the Brak story in its title illustration. As a novel, Brak the Barbarian was first published in paperback by Avon Books in July 1968. It was reprinted by Pocket Books in July 1977, and by Tower Books in April 1981. The first trade paperback edition was published by e-reads.com in 1999. British editions were issued by Tandem in 1970 (reprinted in 1976) and Star/W. H. Allen in December 1987. The novel was later gathered together with The Mark of the Demons and two stories from The Fortunes of Brak into the omnibus collection Brak the Barbarian / Mark of the Demons, published as an e-book by Open Road Integrated Media in July 2012. The novel has been translated into German. Plot Brak, a blond, braided and broadsword-wielding barbarian from the frozen north, is an outcast from his people for questioning the traditional war gods. He seeks to reach the glorious southern realm of Khurdisan the Golden, rumors of which have reached even his country. The book (and indeed the series) deals with Brak's episodic quest as he overcomes threat after threat, with the dream of Khurdisan ever before him. His first stop is the city of Kambda Kai, once great but now afflicted by worshipers of the demon god Yob-Haggoth. Here too his religious skepticism gets Brak in trouble, immediately bringing him into conflict with the corrupt and evil cult. Destined to be sacrificed to the evil god, Brak wins free‚Äîbut the demon worshipers and their foul monsters infest all the lands between him and his goal, and in consequence every step of his journey brings new challenges. There is the evil, soul-taking Septegundus, who promises a dire revenge for Brak's humbling of himself and his dark god. Later Brak is enslaved at the terrible mines of King Ushiram of Toct and starts a slave rebellion; confronts the conjurer Ankhma Ra whose Silk of Shaitan can rip the living heart out of anyone it touches; confronts the treacherous Zama Khan at the ruins of cursed Chambalor and frees thousands of ghosts who had been trapped there in prolonged torment; and saves the life and throne of Queen Rhea of Phrixos (after she first saved him at considerable risk to herself) averting her enforced betrothal to the odious Lord of the Tigers. In nearly every episode Brak also confronts a gigantic monster of one kind or another‚Äîsome of them cultivated by human villains, others seeking human prey on their own account: The Doomdog, haunting the caverns of Toct; the Fangfish, in a deep pool at a sinister mountain pass above the realm of Tazim, Lord of the Tilling; T'Muk, The Thing Which Crawls, a highly poisonous giant spider at Chambalor's desert; and a giant scavenger slug, which in the aftermath of battles at Phrixos feeds on dead (and wounded) soldiers. Though a most formidable fighter when aroused, Brak is not particularly bloodthirsty or aggressive. In most cases, the villains he fights have picked a fight with him in the first place (a costly mistake). Nor is he especially greedy, several times turning up chances to win great treasure. His wants are limited to a few dinshas in his purse, enough to buy food, a pony to ride on (several of the poor beasts get killed in the course of the book and need replacing) and of course a properly sharp broadsword, without which he feels naked. Brak acts according to his own strict code of honor. He keeps his word, once given, even when knowing his \\"civilized\\" interlocutor intends to double-cross him at the first opportunity. He has a strong inhibition against harming women, even vile women who mock his honor and try their worst to harm him. Indeed, in the early episodes Brak encounters an entire collection of very nasty women: The demonic immortal witch Ariane, who wants his soul; the cruel and sadistic Princess Vian; the wanton and corrupt Princess Jardine. In later parts, this is counterbalanced by the warm-hearted Dareet, Zama Khan's daughter who deplores her father's evil ways, and later Queen Rhea, a veritable paragon of virtues. Good women or bad, Brak is clearly determined not to settle down in any one place, but rather continue on his endless, Quixiotic quest for fabled Khurdisan. Even when a young, beautiful and courageous queen is deeply in love with him, he firmly if regretfully declines her offer. The heartbroken queen, left behind, vows to await his return, for decades if need be, and take no other consort‚Äîbut Brak sets out on further wanderings and has many more adventures, detailed in the various sequels. Christian elements Though set in a fictional world, with its own complicated history, Brak early on encounters a religion bearing strong resemblance to Christianity‚Äîthe Nestorians, followers of a religion founded by the goat-herd Nestoriamus, who believe in a universal \\"Nameless God\\" whose symbol is the Cross. They are reminiscent of the Nestorians of our own world, involved in a centuries-long effort to spread Christianity in the Far East. Though not a convert to their religion, Brak is sympathetic to its adherents, like the fatherly Friar Jerome‚Äîespecially since their god is the mortal enemy of the evil demon god Yob-Haggoth, which by definition makes them Brak's allies. To Brak's protestation that \\"I am not a child of your god,\\" Jerome replies \\"You are his child but you do not know it.\\" Later on, when helping Dareet bury her evil and cynical father, who had followed no god, Brak fashions a rude cross to put on his grave. The scene where the demonic Ariane in her flying chariot shows Brak all the wondrous kingdoms of the world and promises them to him in return for his soul is clearly reminiscent of the Temptation of Jesus in the New Testament, where Satan showed Jesus \\"all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them.\\" The basic assumption made in that episode‚Äîthat the minions of evil may physically bind you but can never take your soul unless you voluntarily surrender it‚Äîclearly follows the teachings of Christian theology on that issue. Reception Lin Carter calls Brak the Barbarian \\"a splendid job,\\" \\"one of the best Sword and Sorcery books of the year, and marvelous entertainment.\\" He notes \\"[t]he Brak stories are unabashedly Conanesque in style and flavor: Howard's hero formed the pattern for the genre and John Jakes has limited himself to working in strict traditional confines. Where he differs from the Howardian method, however, he produces excellences and delights. A certain strain of imaginative invention all his own permeates these stories.\\" His \\"imaginative fertility fill[s] the book with a freshness, originality, and color that is Jakes' alone.\\"Carter, Lin.

Together with N√∏rre Voldgade and √òster Voldgade it forms a traffic artery which arches around the Zealand side of central Copenhagen all the way to Kastellet (at Oslo Plads on the coast north of the city centre. The three streets follow the course of Copenhagen's long gone Bastioned Fortification Ring and thus marks the transition between the Old Town and the new neighbourhoods that developed after the fortifications were removed in the second half of the 19th century. History The Philosopher's Path seen from the Haymarket, with Lucia Mill on one side and Vejerboden on the other The street in about 1880 H√•ndv√¶rkerstiftelsen's building on the corner of Vester Voldgade and Ny Kongensgade, 1900 Vester Voldgade was originally a narrow alley which ran along the inner margin of Copenhagen's West Rampart, part of the Bastioned Fortification Ring which enclosed Copenhagen. The city's haymarket was located at the site of the current City Hall Square until the New Haymarket was inaugurated on 1 January 1888. The section from the haymarket to the harbour was originally known as Filosofgangen (English: Philosopher's Path). That section of the ramparts was one of the last to be decommissioned, surviving until 1885. Lange Bridge was located at the far end of the street until 1903 when it was moved to the end of Vestre Boulevard (now H. C. Andersens Boulevard). Notable buildings and residents No. 11 was built for Niels Gade's Music Academy in 1887 in the Renaissance Revival style by Christian L Thuren. It now houses the Russian Center of Science and Culture. No. 19 and 21 are both from the late 1790s and are listed. Hotel Kong Frederik at No. 23-25 first opened in 1900. The building was designed by Phillip Smidth who also designed Politikens Hus on the corner with Vestergade in 1904-07\\\\. The newspaper Politiken has been based in the building since 1912. Vester Voldgade Voldgade 33 is a Functionalist extension from 1934. The low yellow building at No. 119 is a former hay storage from about 1799, part of the Royal Horse Guards Barracks. The building was originally considerably longer but was shortened when Thorvald J√∏rgensen's Post Giro Building (No. 133) was built in 1938. The 45-bay, half-timbered building on the other side of the Post Giro Building, part of F√¶stningens Materialg√•rd, a former military storage facility, is from 1748. Vester Voldgade School (89) was completed in 1890 to a design by Ludvig Fenger. It has housed Den Classenske Legatskole since 1938. The low building on the corner of Stormgade (Stormgade 18) was the first home of Overformynderiet which later moved to a new building on Holmens Kanal. The building was designed by Hans J√∏rgen Holm and is from 1884.

He headed the Itihas Sankalan Samiti (history compilation wing) of the RSS. He was given the responsibility of leading the Akhil Bharatiya Itihas Sankalan Yojana in 1988. He started this work under the guidance of veteran RSS pracharak Moropant Pingle, who had a major role in founding this project. Early life and education Born on February 16, 1915, at Jhandavi village under Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh. Thakur Ramsingh became a swayamsevak in 1941 while doing MA (History) from FC College of Lahore. He topped the college in final year exams of MA in 1942 and was presented a gold medal for it. Keeping in view his extraordinary talent, the college principal had then offered him the lecturership in the same college. But he politely rejected the offer and became an RSS pracharak. Life as a pracharak In 1942, a total of 58 workers had become pracharaks from Lahore alone. The then prant pracharak Shri Madhavrao Mule deputed Thakur Ramsingh in Kangra district. After two years, he was given the responsibility of vibhag pracharak of Amritsar in 1944. At that time Gurdaspur, Sialkot, Kangra, Chamba, Mandi, Suket and Bilaspur were also part of Amritsar Vibhag. Since the Prant Sangh Karyalaya of Punjab was shifted from Lahore to Jalandhar due to Partition in 1947, Thakur Ramsingh also shifted to Jalandhar. When Madhavrao Muleji was jailed in 1948 due to ban on RSS, the work of Punjab Zone was assigned to Shri Bhai Mahavir and Thakur Ramsingh was told to assist him.In 1949, Shri Bala Saheb Deoras called Ramsinghji to Calcutta. The planning was to expand the Sangh work in north-eastern states. Shri Ganga Bishan, Shri Baburao Paldhikar and Shri Agarkar were also called for the same meeting where M. S. Golwalkar gave the responsibility of Assam Prant to Ramsingh. He efficiently held this responsibility for 22 years from 1949 to 1971. After that he was appointed sahprant pracharak of Punjab. Later, he rose to become uttar kshetra pracharak also. Thakur Ramsingh was given the responsibility of Akhil Bharatiya Itihas Sankalan Yojana in 1988. He started this work under the guidance of veteran pracharak Moropant Pingle who was basically the founder of this project. He was unanimously elected national president of Akhil Bharatiya Itihas Sankalan Yojana at the second national convention held at Warangal in Andhra Pradesh in 1992. It was a big challenge for him but he accepted the challenge and started the work from Delhi. All his activities in Akhil Bharatiya Itihas Sankalan Yojana were focused on knowing the real history of the country. He inspired many historians, scholars and senior workers for this objective and very shortly expanded the work in different parts of the country. He was successful in associating many scholars, historians and intellectual with the Yojana. He conducted four national seminars in Himachal Pradesh on human creation in Vaivastar Manvantar, social system, invasion of Sikandar on India and his killing by Dogra warriors in Jammu region, Maharaja Sansar Chand and on many other important topics. It is due to the inspiration of Thakur Ramsingh and the efforts of Akhil Bharatiya Itihas Sankalan Yojana that Thakur Jagdevchand Memorial Research Institute was formed at Neri in Hamirpur district. Ramsingh was its founder patron. Many important projects have already been started at this Institute. Despite growing age and sickness, he remained active like a warrior throughout his life. Just one month back on August 5 he returned from Neri to Ludhiana and participated in a function organized to start a Rs 197 crore history writing project at the National Hamir Museum. Even being at the hospital in Ludhiana he called Shri Vijay Naddha on July 23 and gave him some handwritten facts about the Indian calendar for the Museum. At the later stage of his life, he was completely dedicated to the cause of history and discussed only about the project. Even at the time of being shifted to Ludhiana hospital from Hamirpur he was discussing about the project only.

Before the Tzimtzum, all potential plurality is nullified into simple unity within the absolute Divine Atzmus source. After the emergence of plural manifestations, as Hasidic thought explains, all Creation still remains nullified in truth into non-existence in the absolute Divine source, from the perspective of Daat Elyon (Divine perspective). Only from the paradoxical perspective of Daat Tachton (Creation's perspective) does Creation and plurality appear to exist, seemingly independent of God. Since the innate consciousness of the root souls of Israel in Kabbalah derive from the world of Atziluth, still nullified in the awareness of Daat Elyon, innate Jewish faith senses the falsity of plurality, and would not worship the Torah or the soul community of Israel. God: At Sinai, in Rabbinic commentary, all the People heard the revelation \\"I-Anochi am the Lord-Tetragrammaton your God-Elokecha..\\" The \\"Lord spoke to Moses..\\" is God's essential infinite name. \\"Your God\\" is the concealed Divinity within finite Creation. \\"I\\" is the Atzmus narrator of the Torah, revealed at Sinai, uniting the opposites of Spiritual and Physical in Mitzvot and the ultimate future Atzmus/Atzmut ( from the Hebrew Etzem ) meaning \\"essence\\", is the descriptive term referred to in Kabbalah, and explored in Hasidic thought, for the divine essence. Classical Kabbalah predominantly refers to the Godhead in Judaism with its designated term \\"Ein Sof\\" (\\"No end\\"-Infinite), as this distinguishes between the divine being beyond description and manifestation, and divine emanations within creation, which become the descriptive concern of systemised Kabbalistic categorisation. Reference to atzmus is usually restricted in Kabbalistic theory to discussion whether \\"Ein Sof\\" represents the ultimate divine being in itself, or to God as first cause of creation. Hasidic thought however, concerns itself with relating transcendent esoteric Kabbalah to the internalised psychological experience of man. In Hasidism, the essential divine atzmus above emanation is related to its description of omnipresent divine panentheism in the physical World, and focus on the essential divinity in daily Jewish spiritual experience. This underlies Hasidism's adjustment of Jewish values to extol the innate sincerity of the common folk, and to shape its concern with selfless spiritual motivation in learning, prayer and benevolence, beyond traditional Talmudic mastery for its own sake alone. The concealed divine soul essence that each person possesses becomes revealed in the Hasidic doctrine of the Tzadik leader as divine channel of physical and spiritual sustenance for the community, while the elite perception of essential divine unity of creation in ideal contemplation by the capable few, realises the union of the soul in God. In the Habad investigation of Hasidic thought, atzmus relates, beyond the revelations of Kabbalah, to the essential divine unity and purpose of creation, revealed in the eschatological future as the ultimate Dirah Betachtonim (divine \\"dwelling place in the lowest physical realm), through the essential will in Mitzvot Jewish observances. This relates to the divine essence of Torah and the soul, both reflecting the essential fifth level of Yechidah (\\"Singular\\"). While esoteric Kabbalah relates to the transcendent fourth level of Torah interpretation and the soul, the level of Chayah (Chochmah-Wisdom insight), the nature of Yechidah (innermost Keter-Will delight), enables its higher divine source to permeate and descend lower into perception, as essence permeates all while remaining distinct. The essence of the divine is not restricted to Ein Sof limitlessness or to transcendent Kabbalistic emanation alone. Through seeking to reveal the divine closeness and Omnipresence to all the community, religiously learned or illiterate, Hasidism, across its different schools, sought to hasten the ultimate Messianic realisation of atzmus unity.  Background  = Perceptions of God in Jewish philosophy and Kabbalah = Medieval Jewish philosophers like Maimonides, articulate a transcendent negative theology where it is only possible to describe God in terms of what He is not. Here Divine Unity means that God's singularity is unique and bears no relation to any concept one can conceive. Kabbalah, influenced by the philosophical argument, but seeking the Biblical God who is also immanent, gives a different, more radical solution. It distinguishes between God in Himself and in His emanations. The Infinite Divine, the Ein Sof (\\"Limitless\\") is beyond all understanding, description or manifestation. Only through the 10 Sephirot Divine attributes is God revealed to Creation, and the sustaining lifeforce that continuously recreates existence is channeled. The final sephirah Malchut (Kingship) becomes the feminine Shechina (Divine presence), the immanent indwelling Divinity in Creation. In manifestation God is anthropomorphically described as both male and female, where male denotes outward giving and female denotes inward nurturing. In Kabbalah there are traces of Panentheism, such as the Zohar's description of the two forms of sustenance, the \\"Light that surrounds\\" and the \\"Light that fills\\" all Worlds, and Moshe Cordovero's description of Panentheism in his 16th century quasi-rational hierachical systemisation of Kabbalah. Cordovero reconciles previous opinions regarding the Divine nature of the sephirot, by describing them as lights invested in vessels. Only the vessels differentiate, while the light, originating from the Ein Sof, is undifferentiated, removing any notion of plurality, in the manner water pours into different coloured vessels or light streams through different colours of glass. Regarding perception of Divinity, influenced by the negative theology of the philosophers,The Jewish Religion: A Companion, Louis Jacobs, Oxford University Press. Entry on Moses Cordovero Cordovero says: > Whenever one forms a conceptual image of God, he should immediately > backtrack, recoiling from the false notion, as any notion is shaped by man's > spatial world. Rather, he should \\"Run and Return\\" towards imagining > Divinity, and then rejecting it. In Lurianic Kabbalah the first act of Creation is the primordial Tzimtzum (self \\"Withdrawal\\") of God, to resolve the problem of how finite Creation could emerge from the Infinite. Beforehand, the Ohr Ein Sof fills all reality, nullifying potential creation into non-existence. The tzimtzum constitutes a radical leap, withdrawing the infinite light into God, to allow the latent potentially finite light to emerge, from which Creation unfolds. Subsequently, the sephirot reconfigure as Partzufim, recasting Cordovero's linear hierarchy with one of enclothement, allowing lower Creation to conceal within it higher Divine origins. = Opinions in Kabbalah about the Ein Sof and Atzmus = Before Moshe Cordovero and Isaac Luria gave subsequent systemisations of Kabbalah in the 16th century, Medieval Kabbalists debated the relationship between the Divine Will Keter and the Ein Sof. This involved the philosophical need to divorce the sephirot from any notions of plurality in God, and involved the question of whether the Ein Sof describes the essential Divine Being, or God as first cause of Creation. Cordovero lists Keter as the first sephirah, part of Creation. Luria takes an intermediate view that the Ein Sof does not represent the essence of God, nor that Keter is listed as the first sephirah within Creation, but instead the Ein Sof sublimely transcends Keter, mediating between Atzmus and Keter. He agrees with Cordovero's inclusion of Keter in the sephirot if one is describing the lights in the Sephirot, but in unqualified reference begins the sephirot from Chochmah (Wisdom), as this lists the vessels of the sephirot in Creation. = Ten stages of God‚Äôs Infinite Light before the beginning of Creation = Chabad Kabbalist Yitzchak Ginsburgh describes 10 unfolding stages in the revelation of the Ohr Ein Sof (Light of the Infinite Ein Sof), based on Kabbalah and Chabad thought:[https://www.inner.org/worlds/worlds.htm Introduction and \\"10 stages of God‚Äôs Infinite Light before the beginning of the creative process\\" from inner.org 1 Atzmut (God‚Äôs Absolute Essence) 2 Yachid (The Single One) 3 Echad (The One) 4 Sha‚Äôashuim Atzmi‚Äôim (The Delights of Self) 5 Aliyat Haratzon (The ‚Äúascent‚Äù of God‚Äôs will to create the world) 6 Ana Emloch (The Primordial ‚ÄúThought‚Äù of ‚ÄúI Shall Rule‚Äù; God‚Äôs Primordial Will to be ‚ÄúKing‚Äù) 7 Ein Sof (Infinity) 8 Kadmon (The Primordial One) 9 Avir Kadmon (Primordial Atmosphere) 10 Adam Kadma‚Äôah Stima‚Äôah (Concealed Primordial Man)  Atzmus in Hasidism  = Hasidic Panentheism = The Baal Shem Tov (1698‚Äì1760), founder of Hasidic Judaism, gave a new stage to Jewish mysticism, by relating the transcendent, esoteric structures of Kabbalah to inner psychological perception and correspondence within the experience of man.Overview of Chassidut from inner.org This brought Kabbalah into tangible daily life, while elevating man through the perception of Divinity within himself. The central focus of this was the Divine immanence in all Creation, experienced by both common folk and scholars in joy and cleaving to God amidst materiality. In Hasidic philosophy is also a higher, elite perception of the Panentheistic nullification of Creation within the Omnipresent Divine Unity. \\"All is God, and God is All\\". The ideal mystical perception during moments of prayer is Bittul (\\"Nullification\\"/annihilation of ego) in the Divine reality, beyond the emotional fervour of Divine immanence. In a renowned parable of the Baal Shem Tov: > ...To understand this, we must turn to the Zohar (eg. II 146b), which says > that the gates of the heikhalot (Heavenly palaces/chambers) of prayer are > one above the other, and the angels receive the prayers and transfer them > upward to the Throne of Glory... Now this must be understood: do we not know > of God, blessed be His Name, that \\"the whole earth is full of His glory\\" > (Isaiah 6:3), and that :there is no place empty of Him\\"? (Tikkunei Zohar 57) > If so, then His blessed glory is found wherever anyone prays. In that case, > why is it necessary for our prayers to be received by angels who go and > transmit them from heikhal to heikhal? It seems to me that the answer > follows upon...a parable that my teacher, the Besht, once told before the > sounding of the shofar on Rosh Hashanah: > > There was once a great and wise king who magically created the illusion of > walls and towers and gates. He commanded his people to come to him by way of > these gates and towers, and had treasures from the royal treasury displayed > at every gate. There were some who went as far as the first gate and then > returned, laden with treasure. Others proceeded to gates deeper within the > palace and closer to the king; but none reached the king himself. At last, > the king's son made a great effort to go to his father, the king. Then he > saw that there was really no barrier separating him from his father, for it > was all an illusion. > > ...I heard from my teacher (the Besht) of blessed memory on the verse \\"all > the workers of iniquity shall be scattered\\" (Psalms 92:10): by means of > man's knowledge that \\"the whole earth is full of His glory\\", and that every > motion and thought, everything, comes from Him - by this very knowledge are > all the workers of iniquity scattered. hence, all the angels and the > heikhalot were created and made, as it were, from his essence, like the > snail whose shell is formed of itself. So, by means of this knowledge, there > is no longer any barrier or sundering curtain between man and God.Ben Porat > Yosef p. 140, by Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonne As this ideal was not within the reach of everyone, mainstream Hasidism instituted the social mysticism of the Tzadik Rebbe Divine intermediary, who could inspire the followers during pilgrimage to their court, and channel Divine spiritual and physical blessing to them. Through attachment to the Tzadik, they could transcend their limited physical perceptions through emotional faith. = The Divine soul in Hasidism = Besht, founder of Hasidism, related transcendent Kabbalah to internal correspondence in Jewish spiritual experience.Overview of Hasidut The elite could learn scholarly lessons from the common folk, as the \\"simple faith of the simple Jew reflects\\" the soul's innate essence in \\"the simple unity of God's Atzmus\\"Emunah-Faith, highest soul power, rooted in the Yechidah unity of the soul essence in Atzmus In the Tanya (1797), a classic early work of Hasidic thought, Shneur Zalman of Liadi gave Hasidic doctrine a metaphysical and psychological systemisation. He builds divine service around the conflict between the Divine soul and the natural soul, stating that deeply concealed within the unconscious of each soul of Israel is \\"an actual part of God above (Atzmus), literally\\". This notion underscores general Kabbalah and Hasidism, but is read in a literalist way in the Tanya. Modernist critical Neo-Hasidism has read this statement in existentialist, rather than literalist terms, applicable equally to Jews and non-Jews.  Hasidic investigation of Atzmus  The school of Habad, founded by Schneur Zalman of Liadi (1745‚Äì1812), differed from mainstream Hasidism in seeking to intellectually articulate Hasidic thought in systematic study, with the mind as the route to the heart. Consequently, it retained the mystical ideal to communicate as widely as possible the elite nullification of Creation in Divine Unity.Communicating the Infinite: The Emergence of the Habad School, Naftali Loewenthal, University Of Chicago Press, 1990 In the second section of the Tanya, Schneur Zalman philosophically presents the Panentheism of the Baal Shem Tov, drawing in previous Kabbalistic description. Two levels of Divine Unity are described, both paradoxically true; Lower Unity of emanated Creation dependent on God, Higher Unity of illusionary Creation nullified within God. The follower of Habad method contemplates (Hisbonenus) at length the paradoxical ascent to God during private prayer, or learns Habad thought before communal prayer. The second leader of Habad, Dovber Schneuri expands the thought of his father into practical understanding. His \\"Tract on Ecstasy\\" instructs the intellectual contemplation to reach the consummate complete Bittul of no self-awareness. Superficial emotional \\"Enthusiasm\\" is to be rejected, as it involves the ego. At the supreme level, Divine Atzmus is encountered through the follower perceiving the Divine Etzem essence of his soul. After the Tract on Ecstasy, Dovber withdrew it from general circulation, instead outlining a lower contemplative instruction, accessible to all, in the \\"Gate of Unity\\". It is necessary for the follower to know their spiritual ability. For the average follower, to aim for self-unaware Bittul, beyond emotion, would instead lead to falling below the beneficial spiritual inspiration of emotions. Today, normative ideal Habad practice is to study Hasidic philosophy before prayer, including amongst many texts those on Divine Panentheism, while using the emotional love and awe of God generated, in the subsequent communal morning service. Comsumate Bittul remains for select elite, though all who study Habad thought gain some intellectual and emotional appreciation of the complete Divine Unity. = Dirah BeTachtonim and the purpose of Creation = thumb140pxrightTorah: Habad discourse from 2nd generation. Habad differed from emotional emphasis of Mainstream Hasidism, seeking philosophical investigation of Hasidic thought.Communicating the Infinite: The emergence of the Habad school, Naftali Loewenthal, Chicago University Press The interconnection of previous Habad thought with other aspects of Torah, relation to Messianism, and ultimate Atzmus, emerges in the discourses and talks of the 7th Lubavitcher RebbeHeaven On Earth: Reflections on the Theology of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Faitel Levin, Kehot pub. The book compares the Atzmus-Dirah BeTachtonim theology of the 7th Rebbe with the previous views of Habad Hasidic thought. It sees the sources for this new edifice in the preceding 6 generations of Habad teaching. In The Lubavitcher Rebbes Holiday Maamarim 2 Vol Set, translated by David Rothschild, published by Collel Tzemach Tzedek Tzfat, distributed through Kehot, introduction to Vol 1, Yitzchak Ginsburgh also reviews the generational development of Habad thought. He sees Kabbalistic significance in the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th leaders' teaching, representing new outward development of Being, while the 2nd, 4th and 6th leaders clarified inward Non-Being. Based on the advancing progression of a seminal idea from \\"point to line to area\\", he summarises the cumulative generational advance in teaching, according to the Habad conception that in each generation the teachings of Jewish mysticism ascend in depth, progressively drawing down from a higher source in Divinity to prepare for the Messianic era.

Biography Taschner was born in Krnov (in German, J√§gerndorf), Czechoslovakia, of Moravian origins. After studying with his grandfather,Music Web International he played Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 5 at his debut in Prague, when aged only 7. He studied with Jen≈ë Hubay in Budapest 1930-32, and with Bronis≈Çaw Huberman and Adolf Bak in Vienna. At age 10, he played three concertos with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra under Felix Weingartner. By age 17, having undertaken tours in the United States and Germany, he was concertmaster at the City Theatre of Brno. In 1941, still aged only 19, he was chosen by Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler as Concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic, while also forging a solo career. He attracted immediate attention, and his portrait was used on advertisements for the orchestra's upcoming programs. In 1943, aged 21, he married the 37-year-old pianist Gerda Nette-Rothe.Archipon, Gerhard Taschner; The Early 78 RPM Recordings Gerda Nette-Taschner was born 21 November 1906; a student and adopted daughter of Robert Teichm√ºller; she was still performing in 1999, aged 93. She died 15 October 2012 She then became known as Gerda Nette-Taschner. In the dying days of the Second World War, the sacked German munitions minister Albert Speer devised a plan to protect the players of the Berlin Philharmonic from the invading Soviet forces. They would play a concert under Robert Heger and then be whisked away to a safe location out of Berlin.This occurred on either 28 March or 12 April 1945; sources differ on the exact date. Gerhard Taschner played the Beethoven Violin Concerto. At the end of the concert, however, the players voted to remain in Berlin, in solidarity with their patrons, who were unable to escape. However, Taschner left in a car driven by Speer's chauffeur, taking with him his wife, two children, and the daughter of another musician. They took refuge in Thurnau. From 1946 to 1950 he lived in R√ºdesheim am Rhein. After the War he joined the pianist Walter Gieseking and the cellist Ludwig Hoelscher in a celebrated piano trio. He also played the violin-piano repertoire with Gieseking and Edith Farnadi and the concerto repertoire under conductors such as Karl B√∂hm, Georg Solti, Joseph Keilberth and Carl Schuricht.Violinist.com He was mainly responsible for making Khachaturian's Violin Concerto in D minor known in Germany, having had the score made available to him by the Soviets. In 1947 he made only the third recording of the work, after its dedicatee David Oistrakh in 1944 and Louis Kaufman in 1946. Wolfgang Fortner dedicated his Violin Concerto to Gerhard Taschner. He premiered it in 1947 and went on to become its greatest champion. Fortner also dedicated his Violin Sonata to Taschner. In 1948 Taschner played the Dvo≈ô√°k Violin Concerto in Vienna under Leonard Bernstein, who declined to invite him to the United States at that time. Gravesite of Gerhard Taschner His personal nature was difficult and uncompromising, often leading to irreparable rifts with students, peers and others. He had very strong and inflexible ideas which sometimes put him at odds with conductors and composers. In 1944 he suggested to Jean Sibelius that the final movement of his Violin Concerto in D minor be played more slowly than the composer had indicated; a suggestion not taken up by Sibelius.Music Web International During a rehearsal in the late 1940s, he and the conductor Herbert von Karajan were unable to agree on some matters of artistic interpretation, which led to Taschner storming out of the rehearsal and refusing to play the concert; the two never played together again. In 1950 Taschner was appointed a professor at the Musikhochschule in Berlin. He also concertised internationally; in South America he was dubbed \\"the Manolete of the violin\\".Tahra In Europe, he was seen as the successor to Adolf Busch, Huberman and Fritz Kreisler. A back condition caused his withdrawal from the concert platform in the early 1960s when still aged only 40. He continued to teach and play chamber music, and served on various competition juries such as the 1957 Henryk Wieniawski Competition in Poznan; the 1957 and 1959 Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud Competition in Paris, the 1960 Paganini Competition in Genoa and the 1963 Queen Elisabeth Competition in Brussels. Gerhard Taschner died in Berlin in 1976, aged 54. He is buried in the III. Municipal cemetery Stubenrauchstra√üe in Berlin-Friedenau. Posthumous reputation Taschner never had a major recording contract. However, he made numerous radio broadcasts and many of these recordings have been re-released, or released for the first time, leading to a latter-day following. Many of the radio recordings were confiscated by the invading Soviet forces at the end of the war, and came to light only after their return in 1991. Critical reaction to these recordings varies considerably: one critic compares him with Jascha Heifetz, Bronis≈Çaw Huberman, Nathan Milstein and Ginette Neveu when it comes to intensity of expression and richness in sound colours, but another says he is not in the same league as Joseph Szigeti, Isolde Menges, Emil Telm√°nyi or Szymon Goldberg. Of his recording of the Ravel Violin Sonata, one critic says: Taschner projects the Ravel Sonata's jazz-tinged nuances to perfection, but another says His Ravel sonata misses the jazzy comical element and is rather straightforward and serious. The Berlin University of the Arts created the \\"Gerhard Taschner Prize for Violin\\" in his honour. There is a biography of him: Gerhard Taschner ‚Äì das vergessene Genie.

The volost was established in 1868 when Ekostrovskaya, Pechengskaya, and Voronyinskaya Volosts of Kemsky Uyezd were merged. In 1871, Murmansko-Kolonistskaya Volost was split off from it. When Kolsky Uyezd (known as Alexandrovsky since 1899 and, alternatively, Murmansky since 1920) was restored on , 1883, Kolsko-Loparskaya Volost was one of the six volosts transferred to it from Kemsky Uyezd. On , 1912, Teriberskaya Volost was split off. On January 8, 1918, the community assembly of Voronezhskoye (Voronyinskoye) Rural Community decided to establish a separate Lovozerskaya Volost out of four of the pogosts of Kolsko-Loparskaya Volost (Lovozersky, Lyaozersky, Semiostrovsky, and VoronezhskyAdministrative- Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 68‚Äì69). The request was considered by the Alexandrovsk zemstvo on March 29, 1919, but no final decision was made and the matter was postponed pending the review of the reasons substantiating the request. The new volost was not established until the restoration of the Soviet power on the Kola Peninsula in 1920. On March 2, 1920, the Murmansk Soviet of the Commissars issued Resolution No. 4 which established the new volost under the name of Loparskaya (instead of Lovozerskaya), the population of which was predominantly Sami.A Guide to the State Archives, p. 192 The Murmansky Uyezd Executive Committee issued its own resolution on June 1, 1920. The creation of selsoviets within the volost started in February 1920. In the beginning of 1921, as a result of the Treaty of Tartu signed between Russia and Finland on October 14, 1920, portions of Kolsko-Loparskaya Volost (a part of Songelsky Selsoviet in particular) were ceded to Finland. The volost became a part of Murmansk Governorate at the time of its establishment on June 13, 1921. By the Resolution of the volost Executive Committee of August 26, 1921, new Pulozersky Selsoviet, with the administrative center in the pogost of Pulozero, was established in the first half of 1922 on the territory split off from Yekostrovsky Selsoviet. Imandrsky Selsoviet was mentioned in some of the documents in 1922‚Äì1924, but its existence is not corroborated by other documents, which included the station of Imandra as a part of Yekostrovsky Selsoviet. In 1923, when the pogost of Notozersky was moved down the Tuloma River, the settlement of Restikent became the administrative center of Notozersky Selsoviet. On July 8, 1924, the Presidium of the Murmansk Governorate Executive Committee issued a resolution transferring the pogost of Motovsky to Novozerskaya Volost. While the resolution was never approved by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, it was nevertheless implemented in practice. On December 9, 1924, the volost Executive Committee issued a resolution to move the administrative center of Yekostrovsky Selsoviet from the selo of Polovinka to the station of Khibino. The volost was abolished on August 1, 1927 along with the rest of the volosts of Murmansk Governorate when the latter was transformed into Murmansk Okrug, redistricted, and transferred to the newly created Leningrad Oblast.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 34 The territory of the former Kolsko-Loparskaya Volost became a part of Kolsko- Loparsky District.

He produced over 100 records, 23 films and published more than a dozen books in his lifetime and much of his work was carried out under the auspices of UNESCO.Liner notes, Argo LP ZFB 52 \\"Songs of Krishna\\", 1971. Early life Bhattacharya was born to an old Bengali Brahmin family that was settled in Benares for over 130 years. As a young man, he was influenced by the work of English poet Lewis Thompson, which prompted him to move to England, where he worked for the BBC as a radio producer. Knowing a lot of Indians in London, he started to record Indian musicians on a Baird tape recorder. When Bhattacharya had the idea to do field recordings in India, he was met with a financial dilemma of needing ¬£80 for the tape recorder, ¬£20 for the transformer, ¬£25 for 20 blank tapes, plus about ¬£60 for a one way boat ticket to Bombay. Sunday Wilson ‚Äì a producer for the overseas service, commissioned him for six five- minute programmes, which garnered ¬£30.6.0. Weeks after that, the poet Stephen Spender, who had started his new magazine Encounter, approached Bhattacharya to write an article on Indian poetry and advance him on two further articles. The London based company Argo Records Ltd. that specialized in classical music also advanced ¬£25 and paid for the Gaumont-British machine, and the tapes against future royalties. He returned with enough material to make four or five records, and one of them was published, called \\"Songs from Bombay\\". This led to a trip through the Middle East, recording music in every country, as well as other projects. Career Bhattacharya continued to earn international recognition as an expert on ethnic folk music, dance and poetry and was employed to help teach ethnic music and bring ethnic musicians to Sweden. Living for periods of time in London and Stockholm he began making films in 1962 when his BBC Third Programme producer, Robert Leighton, introduced him to David Attenborough, who was then an executive at BBC Television. When Bhattacharya told him that he would be going to India with an experienced cameraman, Attenborough offered him ¬£1,000 to help with his expenses. Upon his return, the BBC edited the material into two films: Kathakali, the classical dance drama of South India, and Storytellers From Rajastan. Following this, Swedish Television gave him money to make a film in Hungary. This led to film making in Romania, Tibet, China, Bangladesh, Nepal and many other countries. Towards the end of his career, Bhattacharya had archived over 16,000 photographs related to his various projects.

It aired on ABC from December 29, 1975 to April 9, 1976. It included five female neighbors as contestants, who were asked gossip questions about each other. Regis Philbin co-hosted the show with Jane Nelson, and Joe Seiter was the announcer. It was produced by Bill Carruthers. Gameplay Two female neighbors competed for cash by answering questions about a panel of three of their neighbors. Philbin read a statement about one of the two contestants and the contestants must guess which contestant most of the panel felt that question applied to. Correct answers scored $25. In round 2, the contestants must guess which panelist made a particular statement about that player. A correct selection scored $50 while the selected panelist earned $25 whether correct or not. In round 3, a statement would be read about one of the two contestants, made as a unanimous opinion by all three panelists. The first player to buzz in and choose the correct neighbor earned money. Choosing the wrong neighbor won the opposing neighbor the money. The first question scored $50, the second question was worth $100, $150 for the third, $200 for the fourth, and $300 for the fifth question. After the fifth question, the player with the most money won a bonus prize. Episode Status The tapes of Neighbors episodes are believed to have been destroyed, though a clip surfaced on a 2000 E! True Hollywood Story profile of big money game shows (including Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, which Regis Philbin hosted at the time). At least three episodes are known to exist and are in the hands of private collectors. On August 7, 2013, an episode of the show was uploaded on YouTube. The pilot episode also exists, featuring an opening song different from one used for the rest of the series. On February 6, 2015, another episode of The Neighbors was uploaded to YouTube. The episode in question was recorded from its original airing by a viewer of KABC-TV and aired sometime in March 1976, but is missing its intro.

It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 as a part of the County Courthouses in Iowa Thematic Resource. In 2012 it was listed as a contributing property in the Montezuma Downtown Historic District. The courthouse is the second building the county has used for court functions and county administration. History Poweshiek County's first courthouse was a two-story frame building constructed on the northeast corner of the town square in 1850. It served the community as a school, church, and meeting place as well as a courthouse. The courtroom was on the first floor and the county offices were located on the second floor. In time the building was remodeled as a house. The present building was built for $1,928.15 in 1856. Drake & Dryden designed and built the Greek Revival structure, which is one of the oldest courthouses and one of few that are left in this architectural style in Iowa. with An addition was added to the building in 1890 and major repair work was completed in 1933. Another addition on the south side of the building was completed in 1982. Architecture The courthouse is a two-story structure composed of dark red brick. A large square brick tower on the main facade rises to a white octagonal bell tower with a white dome. The arched main entrance is located at the base of the tower. The building also features pedimented gable ends, a wide triglyph frieze, and pilasters whose caps crowd the tops of the second-story windows. The raised basement is composed of course stone. The significance of the courthouse is derived from its association with county government, and the political power and prestige of Montezuma as the county seat.

GIPC3 is a member of the GIPC (GAIP-interacting protein C terminus) gene family that also includes GIPC1 and GIPC2. The encoded protein, GIPC3, features a centrally located PDZ domain, which is flanked on each side by a single GIPC-homology domain. Function GIPC3 is thought to be important for acoustic signal acquisition and propagation in hair cells of the mammalian cochlea. Gene The human GIPC3 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 19 at p13.3. The locus extends over about 8 kbp and contains the six coding exons that give rise to an open reading frame of 639 nucleotides encoding the GIPC3 protein of 312 amino acids. A single PDZ domain is located at amino acid position 122-189. In the mouse, Gipc3 is located on chromosome 10 at cytogenetic band qC1. The genomic region covers a distance of 5.5 kbp. The six coding exons encode a protein of 297 amino acids. The PDZ domain is located at amino acid position 107-174. Genetics In the mouse, a missense mutation in Gipc3 (c.343G>A) leads to a non-synonymous amino acid replacement (p.G115R) in the loop connecting two beta strands of the PDZ domain. Glycine 115 is conserved in all GIPC proteins. Missense (c.785C>T; p. L262R) and nonsense (c.903G>A, p.W301X) mutations in human GIPC3 cause congenital sensorineural hearing impairment in families segregating non-syndromic hearing loss DFNB15 and DFNB95. Phenotypes Mice of the Black Swiss strain develop early-onset slowly progressing sensorineural hearing loss. A genetic study identified two quantitative trait loci (QTL) that control hearing function. One QTL, named age-related hearing loss 5 (ahl5) localizes to chromosome 10 and accounted for ca. 60% of the variation in hearing thresholds. A second QTL, ahl6, localized to chromosome 18 and has a smaller effect size. Besides their hearing impairment, Black Swiss mice also are hypersensitive to acoustic stimulation, reacting with seizures (audiogenic seizures) to loud white noise. A genetic locus conferring susceptibility was identified (juvenile audiogenic monogenic seizures1, jams1) on chromosome 10. A positional cloning approach aimed to decipher the genetic basis of both the hearing loss and audiogenic seizure susceptibility subsequently identified the glycine to arginine substitution in Gipc3 as the underlying cause. In humans, individuals with the p.W301X missense mutation (DFNB95) exhibit bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with threshold shifts of 70-80 dB hearing levels as early as 11 months of age.  Interactions  The PDZ domain of GIPC family proteins interact with: * Frizzled-3 (FZD3) class of WNT receptor, * insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF1R), * receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA, * TGF-beta type III receptor (TGF-beta RIII), * integrin alpha6A (ITGA6), * transmembrane glycoprotein TPBG, and * RGS19/RGS-GAIP.

Note, due to historical circumstances (i.e. Russian occupation) first hierarchs of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church carried titles without mentioning of Kyiv. Although sometimes being referred to as primates out of all hierarchs only Mykhailo Levitsky officially carried the title of primate which was granted by the Austrian Emperor as the Primate of Halychyna and Lodomeria, but not approved by the Pope of Rome. Brief overview Following the Union of Berestia, in the 16th century the Eastern Orthodox Metropolitan of Kyiv, Halych and all Rus located in the Polish-Lithuania Commonwealth broke relations with the Patriarch of Constantinople and placed themselves in communion with the Patriarch of the West, thus establishing what later was known as \\"Ruthenian Uniate Church\\" or \\"Ruthenian Catholic Church\\". Certain dioceses in the Carpathian region including Halychyna and Subcarpathian Ruthenia stayed loyal to the Patriarch of Constantinople for another 100 years. In 17th century dioceses in Halychyna eventually joined the Union of Brest, while the Orthodox diocese in Subcarpathian Ruthenia came under communion with the Pope of Rome through the Union of Uzhhorod and was temporarily placed under the Latin bishop of Eger. Following the partitions of Poland, the Russian Empire occupied most of the territory of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Carpathian region with Halychyna and Subcarpathian Ruthenia was passed to the Habsburg Monarchy. The Russian Emperor refused to have primates of the Uniate Church to be approved by the Pope. The Uniate Church under Habsburg Monarchy (later the Austrian Empire) was forced to reorganize. After losing its main archdiocese in Kyiv, the Uniate Church had its historical metropolis of Halych reinstated, centered in the archdiocese of Lemberg (Lviv). At the same time, the diocese (eparchy) of Munkacs (Mukachevo) was ceded from the jurisdiction of the Latin bishop of Eger, but instead of rejoining the Uniate Church it was given a self-rule on demand of the R√°k√≥czi family. In 19th and 20th centuries the Church lost most of its dioceses, most of which were taken over by the Russian Orthodox Church. During this time, some emigrants of Austria-Hungary established the Ruthenian Catholic Church in the United States. In 20th century dioceses were created in various parts around the globe.

Metropolitans of Kyiv: * Irakliy (1808‚Äî1809) * Hryhoriy (1809‚Äî1814) * Josafat (1818‚Äî1838) Following the Synod of Polatsk (1838), the Ruthenian Uniate Church was forceably abolished on the territory of the Russian Empire, and its property and clergy transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church. Greek Catholic Church Upon the partition of Poland, Eparchies that ended up within the Habsburg Monarchy were reorganized. The Eparchy of Lviv was converted into archeparchy and its bishop became a Metropolitan bishop governing the rest of the eparchies of the former Ruthenian Uniate Church. The new Metropolia received name of Halych and in way became a successor of the 14th century Metropolia of Halychyna. All primates were approved by the Pope. Metropolitan of Halych and Archbishop of Lviv: * Antin II (1808‚Äî1814) * Mykhailo II (1816‚Äî1858), also served as a Primate of Halychyna and Lodomeria * Hryhoriy II (1859‚Äî1866) * Spyrydon (1866‚Äî1869) * Josyf II (1870‚Äî1882) * Sylvester (1882‚Äî1898) * Julian (1899-1900) * Andrei (1900‚Äî1944) * leading bishop Josyf Slipyj (1944-1945) In 1945 Josyf Slipyj as leading bishop of the Greek Catholic Church was arrested by the Soviet authorities.

O'Connell attended the Massachusetts Bay Community College in Wellesley, Massachusetts and Massasoit Community College in Brockton, Massachusetts.  Political career  O'Connell launched her first State Representative campaign against incumbent Democratic State Representative James Fagan in June 2009, citing comments Fagan made in 2008 during a debate on a child sexual assault bill as her inspiration to run. O'Connell went on to beat Fagan in the 2010 General Election by 44 votes on election day, prompting a recount. O'Connell held on in the recount, with her margin of victory shrinking to 31 votes. O'Connell won re-election in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018, facing a Democratic opponent in each election. In 2019 O'Connell ran for Mayor of Taunton and won, becoming the 50th Mayor and first female Mayor in Taunton's history. O'Connell faced controversy at the start of her mayoral campaign, with Commonwealth Magazine reporting that Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito gave O'Connell notice that incumbent Taunton Mayor Thomas Hoye would not run for re-election.

According to the USGA, and Golf Magazine, its golf course is one of the first in the United States, and was home to the first Massachusetts Open in 1905, won by golfer and course designer Donald Ross. History Vesper Boat House 1905 The Vesper Country Club is the merger of the Vesper Boat Club, founded in 1875, and the Lowell Country Club, founded in 1892.Over One Hundred Years of Tradition In the 1880s, Wickasee Island (former home of Chief Wannalancit who left in 1686), now known as Tyngs Island in the Merrimack River, was a favorite recreation spot for the area. People would gather for outings and picnics, as well as an amusement park was built, but in 1887 a fire destroyed most of the buildings. A few years later, in 1893, the Lowell Country Club purchased Tyngs Island in the Merrimack River for $7,123.00, and built the original club house. The following year, 1894, a 1/3 mile oval bicycle track was installed, circling two baseball fields, and that is when the two clubs, the Vesper Boat Club, and the Lowell Country Club voted to merge. In 1895, the island was developed with six links golf course as the game of golf became popular. Just two years later, golf became the club's main attraction, as the course expanded to 9 holes. The two clubs officially became the Vesper Country Club in 1899. In 1903, Vesper became a charter member of the Massachusetts Golf Association, and in 1905 as the new clubhouse was complete, the first Massachusetts Open was held at Vesper, won by Donald Ross. Vesper Foot Bridge 1908 In 1908, the 550 ft long, steel cable, suspension foot bridge was installed.http://www.bridgemeister.com In 1914 Ross returned as a course designer, and the golf course was expanded to have 18 holes, with the other 9 being on the mainland. In 1923, the Clubhouse burned to the ground, but was rebuilt by the next year. The Great Flood of 1936 destroyed most of Vesper, as the Merrimack river overflowed its banks, but the club rebuilt, despite losing 50% of its membership. In the late 1990s into the early 2000s, Vesper underwent another major renovation of its golf course.North Shore Golf, \\"Remarkable renovation at Vesper\\" May 28, 2010, by Gary Larrabee In 2008, the membership voted to completely rebuild all 18 greens to USGA specifications and to restore the bunkers on the course. The rebuilding of the greens and the restoration of the bunkers was overseen by architect Brian Silva, Golf Course Superintendent Chris Morris and Assistant Golf Course Superintendents Chris Hans and Christopher Orlich. The restoration attempted to be faithful to the original design and plans of Donald Ross. This rebuilding project was completed at the end of 2009. In the March 10, 2011 issue of Golf Week magazine, Vesper's golf course was ranked as one of the top 100 classic golf courses in the U.S.http://www.golfweek.com/news/2011/mar/10/2011-golfweeks- best-classic-courses/ The course record for Vesper is 62 shot by a professional.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 as a part of the County Courthouses in Iowa Thematic Resource. In 1985 it was listed as a contributing property in the Albia Square and Central Commercial Historic District. The courthouse is the third building the county has used for court functions and county administration. History Monroe County was originally called Kishkekosh County, and its first courthouse was a log structure built in 1846. It featured a half-story sized room above the courtroom for jury deliberations. It was torn down in 1860 and replaced by a Tudor Revival-style building in the town park. The new building was ordered by Judge James Hilt, who ran the county from 1851 to 1861. There was considerable opposition to the new courthouse, and a local newspaper said that Judge Hilton chose the worse of the two proposed designs for the building. The cornerstone for the present courthouse was laid on August 29, 1902. It was designed by Des Moines architect O.O. Smith, and constructed by James Rowson & Sons for around $100,000. with Architecture The exterior of the three-story structure is composed of buff-colored sandstone. Its architectural style is primarily derived from the Neoclassical, but the heavy rock-faced exterior is from the Richardsonian Romanesque style. All four elevations feature slightly projecting center pavilions that rise to a pediment above the roofline. On the north and south elevations, the pavilions are flanked by square towers that terminate with a decorative cap. A projecting cornice runs below the roofline. Above the main entrance is a large round-arch window flanked by Ionic columns. A square stone tower with clock and four small parapets rises from the center of the building. Its original spire has been removed. The significance of the courthouse is derived from its association with county government, and the political power and prestige of Albia as the county seat.

An aircraft based on an aircraft carrier is called carrier-based aircraft. Characteristics A navalised aircraft typically differs from its land-based equivalent by: * The airframe, engine and avionics are marinised against salt water corrosion. * It is designed to be used on a flight deck. For a fixed wing aircraft this typically means catapult attachment points, a tailhook and strengthened undercarriage. Naval helicopters usually have wheels rather than skids and may have mechanisms to attach to the deck. * It is designed to occupy minimum hangar space ‚Äì for example the wings, tail-boom or rotors may fold. * There is enhanced protection against water ingress (including that from hosing down with fresh water to get rid of salt water). * Equipment such as sensors and weapons are optimised for naval roles. * The avionics is compatible with the complex electronic equipment of a warship, and that there is no electromagnetic interference between the two. * There is provision for ditching at sea. * Helicopters may have provision for receiving fuel through the cabin while hovering adjacent to a ship. For safety reasons, the aviation fuel provided by ships may be different (e.g. AVCAT) from that provided by airfields and tanker aircraft.Shell Fuels Technical Data Sheet - F-44 Examples The T-45 Goshawk is a navalised version of the BAE Hawk jet trainer.

The group is accused of racketeering offenses, bank fraud schemes, kidnappings, and drug trafficking. Armenian Power (also known as AP-13) which originated 20 years ago in East Hollywood and has over 200 members, has developed from a street gang into an international criminal organization. Apprehension On February 16, 2011, in an operation conducted by the Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force which includes the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Office of Inspector General for U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the Burbank Police Department, the Glendale Police Department and the Los Angeles Police Department, law enforcement apprehended 74 members and associates of the Armenian Power transnational criminal organization. The suspects were arrested in about 90 locations throughout Southern California. About 1,000 law enforcement agents took part in the operation. The lead Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force was assisted by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Marshals Service, the California Department of Motor Vehicles and the Bureau of Investigation of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. It took approximately two years of investigations including usage of undercover agents to carry out the February 2011 arrests. Dubbed \\"Power Outage\\" the operation is recognized as the biggest one against Armenian Power syndicate to date. A total of 113 defendants from four U.S. cities of Los Angeles, Santa Ana, Denver and Miami have been charged with racketeering, assault, robbery, bank fraud, kidnappings, firearms and drug trafficking, health care fraud, identity theft and credit card fraud. According to U.S. Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer, \\"the crimes alleged in these indictments were calculated, wide-ranging, and sophisticated\\" and ties of Armenian Power group transcend prisons and international borders. It is alleged that more than 400 crimes have been conducted by the group. One of the cases of kidnapping and racketeering involved kidnapping of a businessman and extorting $500,000. The arrests of Armenian Power members follow the 2010 Medicaid Fraud committed by other Armenian American criminals. Arrests took place in a similar crackdown in October 2010. Charges Two federal indictments have been put forth in relation to the arrests. The first indictment charges 29 defendants with RICO conspiracy in violation of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970, alleging the indicted criminals have conducted white-collar crimes including identity theft, credit card skimming and production and use of counterfeit checks. The 134-count indictment includes a specific case of bank fraud and counterfeit credit card scheme which victimized hundreds of customers of 99 Cents Only Stores in Southern California, eventually stealing more than $2 million by acquiring customer account information data at cash registers using secretly installed skimming devices and creating counterfeit debit and credit cards. Additionally, the indictment includes charges against Armenian Power members for kidnapping, extortion, bank fraud, aggravated identity theft, credit card fraud, marijuana distribution, and carrying out illegal gambling activities. FBI stated that the arrested criminals, if convicted, might face different sentences from 10 to 20 years in prison. The second indictment from grand jury of Orange County charges 20 defendants, two of whom were also a subject of the first indictment, with bank fraud scheme which targeted elderly victims. Investigations revealed that the members of Armenian Power were cooperating with members of African-American street gangs and bribed some bank employees to obtain information which allowed them to take over bank accounts consequently causing losses amounting to a grand total of $10 million. Additionally, Los Angeles County District Attorney charged 11 defendants in seven cases filed in superior court. Federal authorities also charged 13 members in Miami and one in Denver. The Denver PD has arrested Nadezda Nikitina, 24 of Denver, Colorado, for her role in the Armenian Power-led fraud. A Russian immigrant, Nikitina is charged 10 counts of bank fraud, wire fraud and with conspiring with others to make false statements on credit and consumer, home equity loan applications. Some examples of racketeering and extortion include kidnapping a victim, threatening him with violence in an auto body shop belonging to one of Armenian Power members as well as targeting another victim with an extortion scheme for repeated payments lasting several months by threats to the victim himself and his family. The defendants were allegedly also in possession of marijuana and firearms. Financial crimes part of the indictments alleges that the members of Armenian Power also engaged in a large scale fraudulent check scheme where they obtained customer information for high value accounts, impersonated the customers of banks to order checks and then cashed and deposited checks thus emptying accounts of actual customers. In addition to ordering checks, members of the group allegedly went to the residences of victims and stole blank checks. A grand total of damages caused by members of Armenian Power is $20 million.

It was designed and built by the architect Henri Sauvage in 1901-1902. The villa is one of the first and most influential examples of the Art Nouveau architectural style in France. It served as a showcase for Majorelle's furniture and the work of other noted decorative artists of the period, including ceramist Alexandre Bigot and stained glass artist Jacques Gruber. It is now owned by the city of Nancy, and is open to the public certain days for tours by reservation. History North facade of Villa Majorelle in 1904 The house was commissioned by Louis Majorelle (1859-1926), a Nancy furniture designer and manufacturer. His father, Auguste Majorelle, a craftsman who made fine lacquered furniture, had begun the family firm in Nancy in 1860, making and selling finely-crafted lacquered furniture, and had been awarded prizes and achieved an international reputation for his work at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1878. His son Louis also planned an artistic career, and entered the course of painting at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1877, when he was only eighteen. His father died two years later, and Louis took over the family firm. At the time that Louis took over the firm, Nancy was growing rapidly, due largely to the arrival of thousands of French residents of Alsace and parts of Lorraine who left their homes after they became part of Germany following the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. The city grew from 50,00 inhabitants in 1872 to 120,000 in 1911. Many of the new arrivals were prosperous, and they wanted fine furniture for their new homes. Louis Majorelle decided to expand the workshops of the firm, then located in the southern part of Nancy. In 1897 he bought a parcel of 3500 square meters in what was then a rural area west of the city, and built a new factory there. He then planned the construction of his new residence close to the factory, a common practice in that period. East facade of Villa Majorelle in 1904 To design his house, Louis chose a young architect recommended by his friends from the Ecole des Beaux Arts; Henri Sauvage, who was only twenty-four. The Villa was his first project. Sauvage was assisted by Lucien Weissenburger (1860-1829), who had designed the nearby factory. Weissenburger went on to design many prominent art nouveau buildings in Nancy, in what became known as the school of Nancy. Majorelle also maintained close relations with artists he had known at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, including the sculptor Alexandre Charpentier (1856-1909) and the painter Francis Jourdain (1876-1958), who collaborated with him on furniture and participated in the decoration of the villa. When the house was completed in 1902, Majorelle assured that it was widely publicized as an advertisement for his firm and his art. An article in the Paris magazine L'Illustration, accompanied by photographs and plans of the house, described it as \\"A house made by an artist for an artist\\" and the summit of modernity. The writer assured the public that the house offered fantasy that was always logical, a sense of comfort, and well-reasoned simplicity. His only criticism concerned the large number of chimneys, which he thought was excessive. Another article by Louis Charles Boileau appeared in the professional journal L'Architecture , which described the house as \\"a search for a new art pushed here very far; in the construction of a beautiful work...\\" This was followed by articles in the popular magazines Art et D√©coration and l'Art Decoratif by the architect Frantz Jourdain, designer of the department store Le Samaritaine in Paris, which stated that the villa had broken away from reminiscence about the past, replacing it with \\"art adopted to the realities of life.\\" The success of the Villa opened an important career for Henri Sauvage. He was commissioned by Majorelle to build a new store in Paris for Majorelle's firm, at a site on Rue de Provence which had previously been the site of the shop L'Art Nouveau of art dealer Siegfried Bing. Sauvage was immediately commissioned to design the decoration of the Caf√© de Paris, and then became one of the pioneers of the Art Deco style in Paris. Majorelle established his studio on the top floor of the building, with a view of the countryside. He called the house the Villa Jitka, after his wife. At the time of its construction, the house was surrounded by a park of 3.5 hectares, including a one hectare garden in front of the house, a garden the size of Place Stanislaus, the main square of Nancy. Not long after the construction, Majorelle made modifications to the house. Sauvage had designed a terrace in front of the house, with a ceramic railing by Alexandre Bigot, with a large curved opening extending the terrace into the interior of the building. The interior terrace proved unsuitable in cold weather, and Majorelle had the curved entry replaced by a new room with windows. The beginning of the First World War in August 1914 marked the end of the era of the Art Nouveau, and greatly reduced the business of Majorelle. The furniture factory caught fire and burned in 1916, and in the same year the house and his shop in Nancy were badly damaged by a German aerial bombardment. Majorelle spent most of his time in Paris, using the workshops and factories of his friends. Majorelle died in Nancy in 1926. After his death, his family could no longer afford to live in the Villa Majorelle, and the house and much of the outlying property were sold off in parcels. Majorelle's factories closed in 1931. The park that surrounded was reduced to a small piece around the house. Majorelle's son, a painter, was in poor health, and decided to move to Marrakesh in Morocco, and took much of the furniture of the house with him. The house was sold to the Department of Highways and Bridges of the French government, and was used as offices, while the interior was considerably modified. The house was not declared a historical monument until January 1975. In November 1996, the property reclassified as a \\"national patrimony of the 20th century.\\" The house was acquired by the city, only a few rooms still as they were in 1902, and only one is furnished. Much of the house is still used for offices by local organizations. The house today is supported by the city and by Association des Amis du Mus√©e de l'√âcole de Nancy. Facades The north, and principal facade of the house, was composed of three distinct blocks of different sizes, whose decoration clearly expressed their function. The block to the right, on the western side of the house, was crowned by the studio of Majorelle, with large windows overlooking what was then the garden. On the first floor were the three bedrooms of the house, and a small salon for Madame Majorelle. The master bedroom was on the south facade, and had its own balcony. On the ground floor, this block contained a combination of dining room and smoking room, just under the master bedroom, and the main salon. The salon originally opened through a curved archway onto the terrace, which had a ceramic balustrade and ceramic plaques by the ceramist Alexandre Bigot, whose work also decorated the best-known art nouveau houses in Paris, the Castel B√©ranger designed by Hector Guimard and the Lavirotte Building by Jules Lavirotte.of different sizes which clearly expressed their function. The block on the right was crowned with the large window and balcony of the studio of Majorelle. In the center of the facade, at a lower height than the right block but standing ahead of it, is the portion of the building housing the staircase, expressed by its large windows. Behind the stairway on the ground floor was the vestibule, leading to the dining room/smoking room and salon. Madame Majorelle on the southwest corner. The main bedroom was on the south side of the house, and had a large terrace. On the left, or eastern side of the house, was a third block, which was set back and had smaller windows. It contained the service functions of the house; the entry hall; the servants entrance; the kitchen and office; and the entrance to the cellar. On the first floor were the main bathroom and toilets, and on the top floor was a maid's bedroom. . <gallery mode=\\"packed\\" heights=\\"200px> File:Villa Majorelle stairway facade.JPGFacade of the stairway File:Villa Majorelle entry.JPGEntry to Villa Majorelle File:Le studio de la villa Majorelle (Nancy) (4011409770).jpgWindow of the studio of Louis Majorelle File:Villa Majorelle rear facade.JPGThe rear facade, with dining room windows below and bedroom terrace above Exterior decoration The outside of the villa featured an abundance of decoration in ceramic, metal and wood, each work unique but harmonious with the style of the building. The service entrance, on the east facade, was given an art nouveau doorway and decorative porch. Even the drainpipes and chimneys were given an art nouveau touch, with trim in vegetal forms, and thus became part of the decoration. Much of the work was by the Paris ceramic manufacturer Alexandre Bigot, who had achieved fame for the lavish facade of the Lavirotte Building in Paris, finished in 1901. <gallery mode=\\"packed\\" heights=\\"200px> File:La loggia de la villa Majorelle (Nancy).jpgLoggia on the west facade, outside Majorelle's studio File:Detail Ceramique Murale.jpgceramic wall decoration by Alexandre Bigot File:Villa Majorelle ceramic panel.JPGCeramic panel on the terrace (now enclosed) by Alexandre Bigot File:Villa Majorelle ext√©rieur 03 by Line1.jpgCeramic terrace balustrade by Alexandre Bigot File:Fen√™tre grille villa Majorelle.jpgWIndow grill File:Villa Majorelle d√©tail 01 by Line1.jpgDrainpipe with vegetal form File:Chemin√©e villa Majorelle.jpgChimney with ceramic decoration File:Cloche Portail.jpgBell on the front gate File:Porche, villa Majorelle.jpgPorch decoration File:Villa Majorelle fen√™tre.jpgDecoration of upper windows File:Villa Majorelle Service entrance.JPGService entrance Interior Decoration Only two of the rooms, the dining room/smoking room and the salon, still have some of their original furniture and decoration, and the first floor rooms and studio have been extensively changed, so photographs are the only to see the interior as it used to be furnished. However, much of the original woodwork, ironwork, stained glass and ceramic ornament can still be seen. The charm of the house lay largely in the way that Sauvage was able to harmoniously unify and showcase the works of the different craftsmen who made the ironwork, ceramics, and stained glass throughout the house. =The vestibule and stairway= The vestibule, inside the front door, has preserved many original decorative elements, including a colorful mosaic floor, a glass and wrought iron grill with a floral design behind the front door; and carved wood panelling and stained glass framing the entrance to the main corridor, which originally also had a floral design tapestry curtain. A large mirror and umbrella rack, placed against the wall facing the doorway, matched the floral pattern of the other decoration and reflected the light coming through the glass and iron front grill. The doors to the corridor were decorated with finely-crafted and decorative brass around the locks. The curving stairway was made of massive oak, finely carved. the stairway was lit by stained glass window with a floral pattern by Jacques Gruber on the first landing, and large windows at the top of the stairwell. <gallery mode=\\"packed\\" heights=\\"200px> File:Villa Majorelle entry grill.JPGWrought iron grill of the front entrance File:Villa Majorelle entry hall mirror.JPGMirror and umbrella rack in the vestibule File:Villa Majorelle stairway on ground floor.JPGStairway on the ground floor File:Les escaliers et les vitraux de la Maison Majorelle.jpgStained glass window in stairway by Jacques Gruber File:Villa Majorelle vestibule wood panel.JPGCarved wood panel in the vestibule File:Villa Majorelle door lock.JPGDecorative brass plate on vestibule door =The Salon= The old photographs of the original decor of the salon show that flowers, both live and dried, were an important part of the decor; there were vases of flowers everywhere, accompanying the floral designs in the ironwork, glass and ceramics. Some of the original furniture was removed by Majorielle's son, the painter jacques Majorelle, who took it to the Villa Majorelle in Marrakech. He replaced the art nouveau glass over the fireplace (visible in the 1904 photo of the salon at the left) with brightly-colored glass from Morocco. He also removed the bedroom set, which after his death was purchased and returned and is now in the Museum of the School of Nancy. <gallery mode=\\"packed\\" heights=\\"200px> File:Villa Majorelle Salon.JPGOriginal fireplace with art nouveau glass and decor of the salon (1904) File:Villa Majorelle Salon 2.JPGOriginal fireplace and decor of the salon (1904) File:Villa Majorelle fireplace in salon.JPGSalon fireplace today,with colored glass added by Jacques Majorelle =The dining room/smoking room= The combination dining room and smoking room was in the center of the house, with windows looking out the back. It had an open plan; there was no wall separating the two spaces. the border was marked by the highly unusual ceramic fireplace, designed by Alexandre Bigot, in the middle of the room.

In 1982 the bedroom furniture was purchased by the city of Nancy and the Direction of the Museums of France, and was placed in the Museum of the School of Nancy. The bedroom set is virtually intact and unique, and was never reproduced. The wood is Japanese ash or tamo and alder, and the plaques of wood are encrusted with copper and mother of pearl. The knobs of the commode, armoire and chevet are made of bronze in the shape of stylized plants. As of April 2016, the Association of the Friends of the Museum of the School of Nancy had plans for installing some of the original furnishings now in the Museum back to its original place in the house. <gallery mode=\\"packed\\" heights=\\"200px> File:Villa Majrolle furniture 2.JPGFurniture by Louis Majorelle in the salon File:Chambre √† coucher Majorelle.jpgThe bedroom furniture from the Villa Majorelle, now in the Museum of the School of Nancy File:Villa Majorelle furniture 1.JPGFurniture by Louis Majorelle in the salon References Bibliography *} * Lahor, Jean.

Foraging habits Although no published research pertaining specifically to the eating habits of the Azuero spider monkey exists, spider monkeys in general are frugivores. They dedicate anywhere from 55 to 90% of feeding time to fruit, but also eat plant parts such as leaves, flowers, seeds, and aerial roots.Di Fiore, A., Link, A. & Dew, J.L.

In addition to the primary influence of fruit availability, the location of water resources, sleeping sites, climatic extremes, and patrolling of range boundaries are all factors that influence spider monkey species ranges. Published research on other spider monkey subspecies suggests that their home range requires anywhere from 95-390 ha in continuous forest. These numbers remain unconfirmed for the Azuero spider monkey subspecies. Threats to survival Due to the highly reduced and fragmented nature of the tropical dry forest habitat that originally covered nearly the entire Azuero peninsula, forest remnants large enough to support Azuero spider monkey populations are rare. This deforestation and the hunting of individuals make up the two most influential factors threatening the survival of Azuero spider monkey populations. Research The Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund has provided funding for research on the Azuero spider monkey. This research is looking into aspects of what the Azuero spider monkey eats, what constitutes a corridor, and how spider monkeys are key indicators of forest health.http://www.speciesconservation.org/projects/Azuero-Spider-Monkey/586  References   External links http://www.azueroearthproject.org *http://www.speciesconservation.org/projects/Azuero-Spider-Monkey/586 *http://environment.yale.edu/elti/ *https://web.archive.org/web/20110203132328/http://prorena.research.yale.edu/home.htm Primates of Central America Spider monkeys ","title":"Azuero spider monkey"},{"id":"30918144","text":"Asbj√∏rn Skarstein (7 March 1922 ‚Äì 22 October 1999) was a Norwegian civil servant and diplomat.

The daughter of the modernist poet John Rodker and dancer Sonia Perovskaia Cohen, who placed her into care at age 18 months, where she remained until 11 years old. Later, Rodker lived with her mother and attended Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls in Elstree, Hertfordshire, but did not shine academically. After failing the matriculation exam needed for university admission, she left school at 17. Improving her German in Prague at the insistence of her father, Rodker became attracted to Marxism, and migrated to Moscow in 1934, joining an acting troupe which toured Ukraine. After falling in love with the actor Gerhard Hinze (later known as Gerard Heinz), the couple had a son Ernest in 1937 while in Odessa. During her time in the Soviet Union, Rodker met Regina Fischer, with whom she later corresponded, and who subsequently became the mother of chess grandmaster Bobby Fischer. The relationship with Heinz did not survive the war. Rodker helped to publicise the Sheffield Peace Conference in 1950, and was involved in several other such gatherings. Between 1950 and 1955, Rodker was involved with the Polish Cultural Institute and (with the artist Peter de Francia and John Berger) began the Soho fair. Rodker's Kensington home was described by the Telegraph obituary writer as the nearest Britain ever possessed to a \\"communist salon\\". She provided help and accommodation for people of a similar persuasion, including the American expatriate Clancy Sigal and the novelist Doris Lessing. Lessing used Rodker as a model for her character Molly Jacobs in her novel The Golden Notebook (1962). During her career in television, Joan Rodker was a researcher on such series as Huw Wheldon's Monitor and ITV's Tempo and script editor on Armchair Theatre and the BBC's Thirty-Minute Theatre.

Education and career  Fagan graduated with a BA from Bridgewater State College in 1969. Between 1969 and 1970, he taught at Mulcahey Elementary School in Taunton, where he was also a coach. In 1973, Fagan earned his JD from Suffolk University Law School. After joining a private law practice for two years, Fagan became a Bristol County assistant district attorney, serving at the Taunton District Court; he would hold this position from 1975 to 1976. Following his term as assistant district attorney, Fagan returned to private practice in 1976 as a partner of Fagan & Goldrick, PC. His long tenure in law has given Fagan a reputation as a ‚Äúwell-known defense attorney.‚Äù Fagan has stated that he represents ‚Äúserious people,‚Äù and he has also remarked that ‚Äúthe people I represent know how to bleeping kill a guy‚Äù. Fagan is known for his off-the-cuff remarks, illustrated by his characterization in the Boston Herald as ‚Äúan outspoken lawmaker and defense lawyer.‚Äù In one instance, Fagan‚Äôs local newspaper, the Taunton Gazette notes that Fagan‚Äôs ‚Äúbrash and quick wit‚Äù is viewed by some observers as a ‚Äúpropensity for occasional over-the-top outbursts.‚Äù  Massachusetts House of Representatives  = 1992 = In 1992, incumbent Representative Marc Pacheco decided to run for Massachusetts Senate, leaving open his 3rd Bristol District seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. At the time, the 3rd Bristol district included all of wards 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 in the city of Taunton. Fagan ran in the Democratic Party primary for the seat, facing opponents Carol Doharty, Gail Tardo, Alfred Baptista Jr, and George Bertoldo. In a close race, Fagan won the nomination with 2,106 votes to Doharty's 2,024 and Tardo's 1,993. Fagan faced Republican Audrey Zrebiec in the general election. He defeated her by a 35 point margin, garnering 10,870 votes to Zrebiec's 5,130 votes. This would prove to be Fagan's most competitive election for nearly two decades. = 1994 = Due to the results of the 1990 United States Census, the boundaries of Fagan's districts were altered slightly prior to the 1994 election. The newly drawn district, still wholly within the city of Taunton, now included all of wards 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, as well as ward 7, precinct A; and ward 8, precinct B. Running for re-election, Fagan faced no opposition in the Democratic primary or the general election, and thus secured a second term in the House. = 1996 = In 1996, Fagan again faced no opposition in the primary or general election, and was re-elected to a third term. = 1998 = Fagan's path to a fourth term was easy again in 1998, as he was re-elected without any opposition in the primary or general election for the third consecutive cycle. = 2000 = In 2000, Fagan again faced no opposition in the primary or general election, securing a fifth term with relative ease. = 2002 = As a result of the 2000 United States Census, the district boundaries were somewhat changed prior to the 2002 election. The new 3rd Bristol district, which was still completely within the city of Taunton, now included all of wards 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8, as well as ward 1, precinct B. Fagan again faced no opposition in the primary election, and only minor opposition in the general. He received 7,809 votes compared to 45 votes for all other candidates, sending him to a sixth term in the House. = 2004 = Seeking a seventh term in 2004, Fagan faced only trivial opposition in both the primary and general elections, winning with over 99% of the vote in both contests. = 2006 = Fagan yet again faced only minor opposition in the 2006 primary and general campaigns, prevailing with over 99% of voters for both elections. = 2008 = In 2008, Fagan sought re-election to a ninth term in the House. He faced minor opposition in both the primary and general, and claimed victory with over 98% of votes in both elections. = 2010 = Fagan ran for re-election to a tenth term in the House in 2010. In the primary election, he faced no major opposition, and won with 97.9% of the votes cast. However, for the first time since his initial election in 1992, Fagan faced serious opposition in the general election. His Republican opponent was court reporter Shaunna O'Connell. O'Connell cited comments that Fagan had made on the House floor in 2008 as her inspiration to challenge Fagan. During debate on Jessica's Law, a bill which would set mandatory 20-year prison sentences for child rapists, Fagan noted that the law would require the young victims to take the stand. As a defense attorney, Fagan argued, he would have no choice but to interrogate the victims, stating, > I'm gonna rip them apart. I'm going to make sure that the rest of their life > is ruined, that when they‚Äôre 8 years old, they throw up; when they‚Äôre 12 > years old, they won‚Äôt sleep; when they‚Äôre 19 years old, they‚Äôll have > nightmares and they‚Äôll never have a relationship with anybody. Fagan's comments drew national outrage, yet Fagan himself defended the comments as hyperbole intended to demonstrate the negative consequences of the bill. Nevertheless, O'Connell sought to make the issue central to her campaign; a mailer distributed to voters by her campaign included an audio clip of Fagan making the infamous remarks. O'Connell also questioned whether Fagan's job as a defense attorney was a conflict of interest, as Fagan would be defending people from laws he had a role in crafting. She referenced Fagan's previous support for tough-on-gun stances, yet noted the irony that Fagan would then request leniency for a client charged with illegal firearm possession. In the same interview, O'Connell went a step further, asserting that \\"intimidating, bullying and unnecessarily going after people is classic Jim Fagan,\\" a straightfoward and personal attack on Fagan's well-document outspoken nature. The contentious campaign came to a head when, during a debate between the candidates, Fagan questioned O'Connell's ability to count, a charge that was viewed by some as sexist. During the same debate, O'Connell refused to look at Fagan, and took her cell phone out while he made his closing remarks. The Taunton Gazette endorsed Fagan in the days prior to the election, citing his experience in the House and track record as a lifelong Tauntonian with deep ties to the community. On election night, O'Connell narrowly defeated Fagan by a razor-thin 44 vote margin. Both candidates requested a recount, the results of which showed O'Connell indeed defeating Fagan, albeit by a slimmer margin of only 31 votes. With the victory, O'Connell became the first Republican to represent the 3rd Bristol district in at least 40 years.  Personal life Fagan is a lifelong resident of Taunton. He is married to Christine (n√©e Lussier), a member of the Taunton School Committee. Together, he and Christine had six sons, Michael, Patrick, Daniel, Kevin, Matthew, and James. Fagan is a Roman Catholic. = Patrick Fagan shooting incident= In January 2002, Fagan‚Äôs son Patrick was shot in the aftermath of a ‚Äúfeud.‚Äù Rather than defending his son as a victim, Fagan went on the record admonishing his son and criticizing him for being unemployed. Representative Fagan stated, > I have no bleeping tolerance for this group of morons, and morons is the > politest term I could apply to them. The truth is still the truth. It > doesn't matter if it's your child. I'll make no excuses for what I believe > is intolerable behavior. ... I'm a citizen who's fed up with this bullbleep > just like everybody else.‚Äù = Death of Kevin Fagan = In the early morning hours of 3 February 2008, Fagan‚Äôs son Kevin was killed after accidentally slipping and falling from the Washington Bridge in East Providence, Rhode Island, which was under construction at the time. Representative Fagan lamented, ‚Äúthis is just an absolutely devastating loss to our family.‚Äù References 1947 births Members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Politicians from Taunton, Massachusetts Massachusetts Democrats Bridgewater State University alumni Suffolk University Law School alumni Living people ","title":"James H.

The courthouse is the second building the county has used for court functions and county administration. History Mahaska County's first courthouse was built during the winter of 1844-1845. It was a two-story frame structure that measured . It also served as a church and opera house. The county discontinued using the building in 1855 and rented office space in town to carry out the various county functions. It was rented out by the county until it was sold in 1867 for $3,800. The old courthouse was moved to a different location, and a bank was built on the old location. Concern over county records led to plans to build a new courthouse, but the county failed to pass a bond referendum and it continued to rent office space. The present courthouse was built in the Romanesque Revival style on part of the Oskaloosa public park. It was built at a cost of $132,000 and was dedicated in 1886. It was designed by the Milwaukee architectural firm of H.C. Koch & Company, and built by the O.J. King Company. Architecture The courthouse is a 3¬Ω-story red brick and stone structure. It is built on a rusticated stone foundation. The main facade has a large stone arch that surrounds the first story entrance. The central tower has a square clock tower with spires at the top. It was altered in 1934 and it now has an Art Deco effect, which gives the building a rather odd appearance. with It was originally taller with a pyramid-shaped roof.
