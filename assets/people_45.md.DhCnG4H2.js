He was the first official photographer to be appointed by the British military, and produced several thousand images between 1915 and 1918, more than a tenth of all British official photographs taken during the war. His work was often posed and formal, but several of his less conventional images are marked by a distinctive use of silhouette. Before and immediately after the war he worked as an official photographer to the Royal Family, but was dismissed from this appointment and stripped of his official honours in 1925, for reasons that were not officially made public. Early life A front-line combat photograph: soldiers of the Wiltshire Regiment going \\"over the top\\" on 7 August 1916, during the Battle of the Somme. Wounded British soldiers and German prisoners heading to the rear during the Battle of the Somme, 19 July 1916. Image taken by Brooks during the Battle of Broodseinde, showing a group of soldiers of the 8th East Yorkshire Regiment moving up to the front, silhouetted against the skyline. Brooks was born on 23 February 1876 at Draycott Moor near Faringdon, the son of a farm labourer.Draycott Moor is taken from the 1881 census; in later censuses he often gave Kingston Bagpuize. The date of birth is given as 23 February 1876 in the 1939 Register, and his reported ages match this in all available censuses, but in his Royal Naval service record he dropped two years and gave his birth as 23 February 1878. He grew up near Windsor, Berkshire, where his father afterwards worked in the Great Park, and as a child frequently encountered members of the Royal Family.Brooks (1921), p. 204 After leaving school in 1890, he worked as a boy on the estates, where one of his duties was to look after a mule given to Queen Victoria by Lord Kitchener. In 1892 he enlisted in the 3rd Dragoon Guards, and after leaving the army joined the Glamorganshire Yeomanry as a volunteer.Brooks (1921), p. 204. His service with the Glamorganshire Yeomanry began before 1902 - he marched in the 1902 Coronation procession - and likely in 1901; Brooks mentions in passing that he had \\"Regimental Number 1\\", and this appears to have been assigned in 1901.  Career  His first encounter with photography came after he took a position in the household of Lady Vivian, widow of Hussey Vivian, 3rd Baron Vivian; Lady Vivian's twin daughters each had a camera, and Brooks was entrusted with developing the films. Paying by weekly shilling installments, he bought a camera himself which he used to take pictures of prominent people for publication; his first portrait was sold to several newspapers through an agency, earning him seven guineas.Brooks (1921), pp. 204-5. The identification of the Vivian household (\\"a lady of quality\\") is based on the twins being Maids of Honour to Queen Alexandra, which is referred to by Brooks. Realising that he could support himself on this income, Brooks left Lady Vivian's employment, and returned to Windsor. Here, he worked as a freelance newspaper photographer, using his contacts within the royal household to arrange access to his subjects. After a short period, he became an official photographer to the Royal Family. In 1906 he accompanied Princess Ena to Spain for her marriage to King Alfonso XIII, where he took the first formal portrait of the couple before their wedding.Brooks (1921), pp. 205-07. Brooks' photographs were published in numerous newspapers including the Daily Mirror,Carmichael, p. 36 and the Manchester Guardian;The Guardian carried a photograph of the \\"King's Children at Balmoral\\", 22 September 1910; this is the first picture in their files attributed to Brooks. as his contract with the Royal Family prevented him from selling exclusive rights.Brooks (1921), p. 209 Each photograph sold for around 10s 6d.Brooks (1921), p. 206 In late 1910, he accompanied the Duke of Connaught to South Africa, and the next year went with King George V to India for the Delhi Durbar, where he had the opportunity to photograph the King on a tiger hunt as well as in more formal contexts.Brooks (1921), pp. 207-8 After returning from India he left the royal household to open a studio on Buckingham Palace Road in central London,Brooks (1921), p. 208 meanwhile continuing to describe himself as the Official Photographer to the King and Queen.London telephone directory for January 1914, p. 131; 1915, p. 101 = World War I = After the outbreak of the First World War he served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, enlisting on 25 January 1915. When the Gallipoli landings were being prepared, Winston Churchill (then First Lord of the Admiralty), who had himself been a war correspondent, arranged for there to be journalists and photographers accompanying the expeditionary force. Brooks, as a professional photographer already in uniform, was appointed as the Admiralty official photographer. In March 1916, he was transferred from the Admiralty to the War Office, given the honorary rank of second lieutenant and appointed the official photographer for the Western Front.Carmichael, p. 48 He was the only professional photographer to cover the Battle of the Somme, recording the attack on the first day from the front-line trenches near Beaumont Hamel.Carmichael, p. 49 In 1917 he was appointed a Chevalier of the Belgian Order of the Crown. In 1918, he covered the Italian campaign and naval activity.Bourne, p. 40; Carmichael, p. 66 The same year, he was awarded the French Croix de Guerre. = After the war = He later returned to royal service, accompanying the Prince of Wales on his tour of Canada and the United States in 1919, and Australia in 1920.Brooks (1921), p. 211 The American leg of the tour posed problems with people trying to capitalise on the Prince's appearance for publicity purposes; one prominent actress, Mildred Harris Chaplin, passed herself off as the niece of a local dignitary in order to be photographed, whilst another offered Brooks a bribe of a thousand dollars to arrange a picture. Brooks admitted that he \\"nearly gave in\\", but backed out at the last minute for fear of offending the Prince. He was less successful in avoiding offence with another photograph, this time of the Prince in his bath during the voyage. After it was published, George V called it inappropriate and Brooks was reprimanded.Brooks (1921), p. 212 For reasons that were not publicly disclosed, in 1925 his appointment as a royal photographer was cancelledThe Times, 6 May 1925; p. 19 and his appointment as Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and his British Empire Medal (BEM) were \\"cancelled and annulled\\". This was widely reported in the British press without commentary other than noting who Brooks was; no newspaper gave any further details. It is likely that it was connected to his arrest and conviction for \\"insulting behaviour\\" to a young woman at an international hockey match in April; he was fined ¬£8 and told that he had narrowly escaped imprisonment. Later that year, after his fall from grace, he published a series of articles in the American McClure's Magazine, \\"Kings, Princes, Governors\\", which gave \\"intimate anecdotes\\" of the royal court. An American newspaper speculated that his downfall was connected to another indiscreet photograph of the Prince of Wales, showing the Prince dressed in a woman's kimono and wig after appearing in a play; however, this photograph was taken and published in October, during the Prince's return from a trip to South America, well after Brooks had departed. In 1926, he filed for bankruptcy. However, he continued to work as a photographer; in 1928, he was convicted of disorderly behaviour outside a ball in Grosvenor Square, after claiming that he was acquainted with the hostess and that had been invited there to take pictures. His photojournalism career lasted at least as late as 1936, when he is credited with taking two photographs of Jerome Brannigan being arrested, after Brannigan had reportedly attempted to assassinate King Edward VIII.There are two photographs of this event credited to Brooks in the Hulton Press Library; nos. 2666173 and 3355372 at Getty Images. By the time of the 1939 National Register, he was living in Clapham with his wife and two daughters, and listed his occupation as \\"unemployed press photographer\\". Brooks later moved with his wife to Hendon, where he lived until his death in 1957. Style and legacy Much of his wartime work, though technically proficient and consistent,Carmichael, p. 39 was rather conventional, often involving posed photographs rather than more candid impromptu shots of his subjects.Carmichael, pp. 61‚Äì63 His work was noted as being characterised by a \\"conscious seeking after a publishable photograph\\", and it was recorded that he occasionally persuaded soldiers to pose for staged pictures of routine activity in the trenches.Carmichael, p. 52 However, he was insistent that combat photographs were never faked ‚Äì \\"we have strict instructions not to do ‚Äì we have never done it\\".Fraser He had a fondness for a dramatic use of silhouette, with images composed to show soldiers walking along a ridge against the light. These images, where individual men were not easily recognisable, often were used to illustrate the \\"anonymous heroes\\" of the war.Carmichael, p. 63 Brooks was the first and the longest-serving of the British war photographers, and took more than 4,400 images.Bourne, p.40 This was the most of any individual photographer, and represented more than 10% of all the official photographs.Carmichael, p. 142 A large collection of his photographs is now held by the Imperial War Museum, and a second collection is held by the National Library of Scotland as part of Earl Haig's papers; both have been digitised. Several formal images from his pre-war service with the Royal Family are held by the National Portrait Gallery, including several from the Delhi Durbar as well as a portrait of Prince Arthur of Connaught and Princess Alexandra, taken at their wedding. There are also two portraits of the young Prince John, both in 1913.Two portraits of the prince attributed to Brooks are held in the Hulton Press Library; nos. 3304766 and 3305272 at Getty Images.

Evidence shows that it can improve quality of life and prevent hospitalization in those with COPD. However, it does not appear to affect the risk of death or the frequency steroids are needed. It is unclear if it differs from the similar medication tiotropium or other commonly used medications from the class of LAMAs. Aclidinium is delivered via a multidose dry powder inhaler, the Genuair inhaler. Adverse effects The substance is generally well tolerated. Common side effects (in more than 1% of patients) are sinusitis, nasopharyngitis, headache, cough, diarrhoea and nausea. The latter is less common under the drug than under placebo. Skin reactions such as rash, as well as side effects that are typical of muscarinic antagonists (fast heart rate, palpitations, and urinary retention), occur in less than 1% of patients. on Tudorza Pressair. A small increase of cardiovascular risk cannot be excluded from available data. Patients with relevant cardiovascular diseases were excluded from studies. Interactions No systematic interaction studies have been performed. It is expected that adverse effects of aclidinium increase if it is combined with other muscarinic antagonists. In clinical practice, no interactions with other COPD medications such as glucocorticoids, Œ≤2-adrenergic agonists and theophylline have been described. As aclidinium does not relevantly interact with cytochrome P450 liver enzymes or P-glycoprotein, and is quickly metabolized as soon as it reaches the bloodstream, it is considered to have a very low potential for interactions. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Aclidinium is a long-acting, reversible antagonist at muscarinic receptors, with similar affinity to all five subtypes, but with a dissociation half-life from subtype M3 of 29.2 hours, or six times longer than that from M2. For comparison, M3 dissociation half-lives of the related drugs ipratropium and tiotropium are 0.47 hours and 62.2 hours, respectively. Its action at subtype M3 at the smooth muscle of the bronchioles is responsible for its desired effect: it reduces contraction of these muscles and improves the airflow. M2 affinity is the main reason for adverse effects at the heart. =Pharmacokinetics= About 30% of inhaled aclidinium are deposited in the lung. Its action there lasts for more than 24 hours. From the lung, it is absorbed into the bloodstream, reaching highest blood plasma concentrations after five minutes in healthy persons and after 10 to 15 minutes in COPD patients. The substance is quickly hydrolysed to the carboxylic acid and the alcohol, so that less than 5% of the inhaled dose are found unchanged in the plasma. Hydrolysis is both non-enzymatic and enzymatic, the latter mainly by butyrylcholinesterase. The acid metabolite has a plasma protein binding of 87%, and the alcohol of 15%. These metabolites are found to 65% in the urine and to 33% in the faeces. Elimination half-life is two to three hours. Unchanged aclidinium accounts for only 0.1% of the excreted dose. Chemistry Aclidinium is a quaternary ammonium cation with an asymmetric carbon atom. It is used as the pure R-enantiomer. The salt, aclidinium bromide, is a crystalline powder that is hardly soluble in water or ethanol. Society and culture =Brand names= It is marketed under the brand name Tudorza Pressair in the US, Eklira Genuair in the UK, and Tudorza Genuair in Canada; licensed to Menarini under the brand name Bretaris Genuair for majority of EU member states. An inhalable combination with formoterol is marketed as Brimica Genuair and Duaklir Genuair in the European Union.

The following terminology has been used by individual authors to describe mass killings of unarmed civilians by communist governments, individually or as a whole: * Genocide ‚Äì under the Genocide Convention, the crime of genocide generally applies to mass murder of ethnic rather than political or social groups. Protection of political groups was eliminated from the United Nations resolution after a second vote because many states, including Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union, anticipated that clause to apply unneeded limitations to their right to suppress internal disturbances. Scholarly study of genocide usually acknowledges the UN omission of economic and political groups and uses mass political killing datasets of \\"democide\\" and \\"genocide and politicide\\" or \\"geno-politicide\\". Killing by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia has been labeled \\"genocide\\" or \\"auto-genocide\\" and the deaths under Leninism and Stalinism in the Soviet Union and Maoism in China have been controversially investigated as possible cases. In particular, the Soviet famine in the 1930s and the famine in China during the Great Leap Forward have been \\"depicted as instances of mass killing underpinned by genocidal intent\\". * Politicide ‚Äì the term \\"politicide\\" is used to describe the killing of groups that would not otherwise be covered by the Genocide Convention. Professor Barbara Harff studies \\"genocide and politicide\\", sometimes shortened as \\"geno- politicide\\", in order to include the killing of political, economic, ethnic and cultural groups. Professor Manus I. Midlarsky uses the term \\"politicide\\" to describe an arc of large-scale killing from the western parts of the Soviet Union to China and Cambodia. In his book The Killing Trap: Genocide in the Twentieth Century, Midlarsky raises similarities between the killings of Stalin and Pol Pot. * Holocaust - The term \\"communist holocaust\\" has been used by some state officials and non-governmental organizations. The term \\"red Holocaust\\" was coined by the Munich Institut f√ºr Zeitgeschichte. Professor Steven Rosefielde used \\"Red Holocaust\\" for communist \\"peacetime state killings\\", while stating that it \\"could be defined to include all murders (judicially sanctioned terror-executions), criminal manslaughter (lethal forced labor and ethnic cleansing) and felonious negligent homicide (terror- starvation) incurred from insurrectionary actions and civil wars prior to state seizure, and all subsequent felonious state killings.\\" According to J√∂rg Hackmann, this term is not popular among scholars in Germany or internationally. Alexandra Laignel-Lavastine writes that usage of this term \\"allows the reality it describes to immediately attain, in the Western mind, a status equal to that of the extermination of the Jews by the Nazi regime\\". Michael Shafir writes that the use of the term supports the \\"competitive martyrdom component of Double Genocide\\", a theory whose worst version is Holocaust obfuscation. George Voicu states that Leon Volovici has \\"rightfully condemned the abusive use of this concept as an attempt to 'usurp' and undermine a symbol specific to the history of European Jews.\\" * Democide ‚Äì Professor R. J. Rummel defined \\"democide\\" as \\"the intentional killing of an unarmed or disarmed person by government agents acting in their authoritative capacity and pursuant to government policy or high command\\". His definition covers a wide range of deaths, including forced labor and concentration camp victims; killings by \\"unofficial\\" private groups; extrajudicial summary killings; and mass deaths due to the governmental acts of criminal omission and neglect, such as in deliberate famines as well as killings by de facto governments, such as warlords or rebels in a civil war. This definition covers any murder of any number of persons by any government and it has been applied to killings perpetrated by communist regimes. * Mass killing ‚Äì Professor Ervin Staub defined \\"mass killing\\" as \\"killing members of a group without the intention to eliminate the whole group or killing large numbers of people without a precise definition of group membership. In a mass killing the number of people killed is usually smaller than in genocide\\". Referencing earlier definitions, Professors Joan Esteban, Massimo Morelli and Dominic Rohner have defined \\"mass killings\\" as \\"the killings of substantial numbers of human beings, when not in the course of military action against the military forces of an avowed enemy, under the conditions of the essential defenselessness and helplessness of the victims\\". The term has been defined by Professor Benjamin Valentino as \\"the intentional killing of a massive number of noncombatants\\", where a \\"massive number\\" is defined as at least 50,000 intentional deaths over the course of five years or less. This is the most accepted quantitative minimum threshold for the term. He applied this definition to the cases of Stalin's Soviet Union, China under Mao Zedong and Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge while admitting that \\"mass killings on a smaller scale\\" also appear to have been carried out by regimes in North Korea, Vietnam, Eastern Europe and various nations in Africa. Jay Ulfelder, with Valentino, has used a threshold of 1,000 killed. Professors Frank Wayman and Atsushi Tago used the term \\"mass killing\\" from Valentino and concluded that even with a lower threshold (10,000 killed per year, 1,000 killed per year, or even 1 killed per year) \\"autocratic regimes, especially communist, are prone to mass killing generically, but not so strongly inclined (i.e. not statistically significantly inclined) toward geno-politicide\\". * Repression ‚Äì Professor Stephen Wheatcroft notes that in the case of the Soviet Union terms such as \\"the terror\\", \\"the purges\\" and \\"repression\\" are used to refer to the same events. He believes the most neutral terms are \\"repression\\" and \\"mass killings\\", although in Russian the broad concept of repression is commonly held to include mass killings and is sometimes assumed to be synonymous with it, which is not the case in other languages. * Classicide ‚Äì Professor Michael Mann has proposed the term classicide to mean the \\"intended mass killing of entire social classes\\". \\"Classicide\\" is considered \\"premeditated mass killing\\" narrower than \\"genocide\\" in that it targets a part of a population defined by its social status, but broader than \\"politicide\\" in that the group is targeted without regard to their political activity. * Crime against humanity ‚Äì Professor Klas- G√∂ran Karlsson uses the term \\"crimes against humanity\\", which includes \\"the direct mass killings of politically undesirable elements, as well as forced deportations and forced labour\\". He acknowledges that the term may be misleading in the sense that the regimes targeted groups of their own citizens, but considers it useful as a broad legal term which emphasizes attacks on civilian populations and because the offenses demean humanity as a whole. Historian Jacques S√©melin and Professor Michael Mann believe that \\"crime against humanity\\" is more appropriate than \\"genocide\\" or \\"politicide\\" when speaking of violence by communist regimes.  Estimates  According to Klas-G√∂ran Karlsson, discussion of the number of victims of communist regimes has been \\"extremely extensive and ideologically biased\\". Although any attempt to estimate a total number of killings under communist regimes depends greatly on definitions, several attempts to compile previously published data have been made: * In 1994, R. J. Rummel's book Death by Government included about 110 million people, foreign and domestic, killed by communist democide from 1900 to 1987. In 1993, Rummel wrote: \\"Even were we to have total access to all communist archives we still would not be able to calculate precisely how many the communists murdered. Consider that even in spite of the archival statistics and detailed reports of survivors, the best experts still disagree by over 40 percent on the total number of Jews killed by the Nazis. We cannot expect near this accuracy for the victims of communism. We can, however, get a probable order of magnitude and a relative approximation of these deaths within a most likely range\\". Due to additional information about Mao's culpability in the Great Chinese Famine from the work of Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, in late 2005 Rummel revised upward his total for communist democide between 1900 and 1999 to about 148 million, using their estimate of 38 million famine deaths. * In 1999, the St√©phane Courtois introduction to the Black Book of Communism gave a \\"rough approximation, based on unofficial estimates\\" approaching 100 million killed. In his foreword to the book, Martin Malia noted \\"a grand total of victims variously estimated by contributors to the volume at between 85 million and 100 million\\". * In 2005, Benjamin Valentino stated that the number of non-combatants killed by communist regimes in the Soviet Union, People's Republic of China and Cambodia alone ranged from a low of 21 million to a high of 70 million. Citing Rummel and others, Valentino stated that the \\"highest end of the plausible range of deaths attributed to communist regimes\\" was up to 110 million\\". * In 2010, Steven Rosefielde's book Red Holocaust said that communism's internal contradictions \\"caused to be killed\\" approximately 60 million people and perhaps tens of millions more. * In 2011, Matthew White published his rough total of 70 million \\"people who died under communist regimes from execution, labor camps, famine, ethnic cleansing, and desperate flight in leaky boats\\", not counting those killed in wars. * In 2014, Julia Strauss wrote that, while there was the beginning of a scholarly consensus on figures of around 20 million killed in the Soviet Union and 2-3 million in Cambodia, there was no such consensus on numbers for China. * In 2016, the Dissident blog of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation made an effort to compile updated ranges of estimates and concluded that the overall range \\"spans from 42,870,000 to 161,990,000\\" killed, with 100 million the most commonly cited figure. * In 2017, Professor Stephen Kotkin wrote in The Wall Street Journal that communism killed at least 65 million people between 1917 and 2017: \\"Though communism has killed huge numbers of people intentionally, even more of its victims have died from starvation as a result of its cruel projects of social engineering.\\" The criticisms of some of the estimates were mostly focused on three aspects: (i) the estimates were based on sparse and incomplete data when significant errors are inevitable; (ii) some critics said the figures were skewed to higher possible values; and (iii) some critics argued that victims of Holodomor and other man-made famines created by communist governments should not be counted.  Proposed causes  = Ideology = Klas-G√∂ran Karlsson writes: \\"Ideologies are systems of ideas, which cannot commit crimes independently. However, individuals, collectives and states that have defined themselves as communist have committed crimes in the name of communist ideology, or without naming communism as the direct source of motivation for their crimes\\". Scholars such as R. J. Rummel, Daniel Goldhagen, Richard Pipes and John N. Gray consider the ideology of communism to be a significant causative factor in mass killings. The Black Book of Communism claims an association between communism and criminality, saying: \\"Communist regimes [...] turned mass crime into a full-blown system of government\\" while adding that this criminality lies at the level of ideology rather than state practice. last issue of Karl Marx's journal Neue Rheinische Zeitung from May 19, 1849, printed in red ink Christopher J. Finlay has argued that Marxism legitimates violence without any clear limiting principle because it rejects moral and ethical norms as constructs of the dominant class and \\"states that it would be conceivable for revolutionaries to commit atrocious crimes in bringing about a socialist system, with the belief that their crimes will be retroactively absolved by the new system of ethics put in place by the proletariat\\". Rustam Singh notes that Karl Marx had alluded to the possibility of peaceful revolution, but after the failed Revolutions of 1848 emphasized the need for violent revolution and \\"revolutionary terror\\". Literary historian George G. Watson cited an 1849 article written by Friedrich Engels called \\"The Hungarian Struggle\\" and published in Marx's journal Neue Rheinische Zeitung, stating that the writings of Engels and others show that \\"the Marxist theory of history required and demanded genocide for reasons implicit in its claim that feudalism, which in advanced nations was already giving place to capitalism, must in its turn be superseded by socialism. Entire nations would be left behind after a workers' revolution, feudal remnants in a socialist age, and since they could not advance two steps at a time, they would have to be killed. They were racial trash, as Engels called them, and fit only for the dung-heap of history\\". Watson's claims have been criticized by Robert Grant for \\"dubious\\" evidence, arguing that \\"what Marx and Engels are calling for is [...] at the very least a kind of cultural genocide; but it is not obvious, at least from Watson's citations, that actual mass killing, rather than (to use their phraseology) mere 'absorption' or 'assimilation', is in question\\". Talking about Engels' 1849 article and citing Watson's book, historian Andrzej Walicki has said: \\"It is difficult to deny that this was an outright call for genocide\\". According to R. J. Rummel, the killings committed by communist regimes can best be explained as the result of the marriage between absolute power and the absolutist ideology of Marxism. Rummel states that \\"communism was like a fanatical religion. It had its revealed text and its chief interpreters. It had its priests and their ritualistic prose with all the answers. It had a heaven, and the proper behavior to reach it. It had its appeal to faith. And it had its crusades against nonbelievers. What made this secular religion so utterly lethal was its seizure of all the state's instruments of force and coercion and their immediate use to destroy or control all independent sources of power, such as the church, the professions, private businesses, schools, and the family.\\" He writes that the Marxists saw the construction of their utopia as \\"though a war on poverty, exploitation, imperialism and inequality. And for the greater good, as in a real war, people are killed. And, thus, this war for the communist utopia had its necessary enemy casualties, the clergy, bourgeoisie, capitalists, wreckers, counterrevolutionaries, rightists, tyrants, rich, landlords, and noncombatants that unfortunately got caught in the battle. In a war millions may die, but the cause may be well justified, as in the defeat of Hitler and an utterly racist Nazism. And to many communists, the cause of a communist utopia was such as to justify all the deaths\\". Benjamin Valentino writes that mass killings strategies are chosen by communists to economically dispossess large numbers of people, arguing as such: \\"Social transformations of this speed and magnitude have been associated with mass killing for two primary reasons. First, the massive social dislocations produced by such changes have often led to economic collapse, epidemics, and, most important, widespread famines. [...] The second reason that communist regimes bent on the radical transformation of society have been linked to mass killing is that the revolutionary changes they have pursued have clashed inexorably with the fundamental interests of large segments of their populations. Few people have proved willing to accept such far-reaching sacrifices without intense levels of coercion\\". According to Jacques S√©melin, \\"communist systems emerging in the twentieth century ended up destroying their own populations, not because they planned to annihilate them as such, but because they aimed to restructure the 'social body' from top to bottom, even if that meant purging it and recarving it to suit their new Promethean political imaginaire\\". Daniel Chirot and Clark McCauley write that, especially in Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao's China and Pol Pot's Cambodia, a fanatical certainty that socialism could be made to work motivated communist leaders in \\"the ruthless dehumanization of their enemies, who could be suppressed because they were 'objectively' and 'historically' wrong. Furthermore, if events did not work out as they were supposed to, then that was because class enemies, foreign spies and saboteurs, or worst of all, internal traitors were wrecking the plan. Under no circumstances could it be admitted that the vision itself might be unworkable, because that meant capitulation to the forces of reaction\\". Michael Mann writes that communist party members were \\"ideologically driven, believing that in order to create a new socialist society, they must lead in socialist zeal. Killings were often popular, the rank-and-file as keen to exceed killing quotas as production quotas\\". = Political system = Prosecutor General Andrey Vyshinsky (centre) reading the 1937 indictment against Karl Radek during the 2nd Moscow Trial Anne Applebaum asserts that \\"without exception, the Leninist belief in the one-party state was and is characteristic of every communist regime\\" and \\"the Bolshevik use of violence was repeated in every communist revolution\\". Phrases said by Vladimir Lenin and Cheka founder Felix Dzerzhinsky were deployed all over the world. She notes that as late as 1976 Mengistu Haile Mariam unleashed a Red Terror in Ethiopia. Said Lenin to his colleagues in the Bolshevik government: \\"If we are not ready to shoot a saboteur and White Guardist, what sort of revolution is that?\\" Robert Conquest stressed that Stalin's purges were not contrary to the principles of Leninism, but rather a natural consequence of the system established by Lenin, who personally ordered the killing of local groups of class enemy hostages. Alexander Yakovlev, architect of perestroika and glasnost and later head of the Presidential Commission for the Victims of Political Repression, elaborates on this point, stating: \\"The truth is that in punitive operations Stalin did not think up anything that was not there under Lenin: executions, hostage taking, concentration camps, and all the rest\\". Historian Robert Gellately concurs, saying: \\"To put it another way, Stalin initiated very little that Lenin had not already introduced or previewed\\". Stephen Hicks of Rockford College ascribes the violence characteristic of 20th-century socialist rule to these collectivist regimes' abandonment of protections of civil rights and rejection of the values of civil society. Hicks writes that whereas \\"in practice every liberal capitalist country has a solid record for being humane, for by and large respecting rights and freedoms, and for making it possible for people to put together fruitful and meaningful lives\\", in socialism \\"practice has time and again proved itself more brutal than the worst dictatorships prior to the twentieth century. Each socialist regime has collapsed into dictatorship and begun killing people on a huge scale\\". Eric D. Weitz says that the mass killing in communist states is a natural consequence of the failure of the rule of law, seen commonly during periods of social upheaval in the 20th century. For both communist and non-communist mass killings, \\"genocides occurred at moments of extreme social crisis, often generated by the very policies of the regimes\\". They are not inevitable, but are political decisions. Steven Rosefielde writes that communist rulers had to choose between changing course and \\"terror- command\\" and more often than not chose the latter. Michael Mann argues that a lack of institutionalized authority structures meant that a chaotic mix of both centralized control and party factionalism were factors in the killing. = Leaders = Professor Matthew Krain states that many scholars have pointed to revolutions and civil wars as providing the opportunity for radical leaders and ideologies to gain power and the preconditions for mass killing by the state. Professor Nam Kyu Kim writes that exclusionary ideologies are critical to explaining mass killing, but also important are organizational capabilities and revolutionary leaders' individual characteristics, such as their attitudes toward risk and violence. \\"Besides opening up political opportunities for new leaders to eliminate their political opponents, revolutions bring to power leaders who are more apt to commit large-scale violence against civilians in order to legitimize and strengthen their own power.\\" Genocide scholar Adam Jones states that the Russian Civil War was very influential on the emergence of leaders like Stalin and accustomed people to \\"harshness, cruelty, terror.\\" Martin Malia called the \\"brutal conditioning\\" of the two World Wars important to understanding communist violence, although not its source. Historian Helen Rappaport describes Nikolay Yezhov, the bureaucrat in charge of the NKVD during the Great Purge, as a physically diminutive figure of \\"limited intelligence\\" and \\"narrow political understanding. [...] Like other instigators of mass murder throughout history, [he] compensated for his lack of physical stature with a pathological cruelty and the use of brute terror\\". Russian and world history scholar John M. Thompson places personal responsibility directly on Joseph Stalin. According to him, \\"much of what occurred only makes sense if it stemmed in part from the disturbed mentality, pathological cruelty, and extreme paranoia of Stalin himself. Insecure, despite having established a dictatorship over the party and country, hostile and defensive when confronted with criticism of the excesses of collectivization and the sacrifices required by high-tempo industrialization, and deeply suspicious that past, present, and even yet unknown future opponents were plotting against him, Stalin began to act as a person beleaguered. He soon struck back at enemies, real or imaginary\\". Professors Pablo Montagnes and Stephane Wolton argue that the purges in the USSR and China can be attributed to the \\"personalist\\" leadership of Stalin and Mao, who were incentivized by having both control of the security apparatus used to carry out the purges and control of the appointment of replacements for those purged. Slovenian philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek attributes Mao Zedong allegedly viewing human life as disposable to Mao's \\"cosmic perspective\\" on humanity.  States where mass killings have occurred  = Soviet Union = Memorial about Repression in USSR at Lubyanka Square which was erected in 1990 by the human rights group Memorial in the Soviet Union in remembrance of the more than 40,000 innocent people shot in Moscow during the \\"years of terror\\" Adam Jones claims that \\"there is very little in the record of human experience to match the violence unleashed between 1917, when the Bolsheviks took power, and 1953, when Joseph Stalin died and the Soviet Union moved to adopt a more restrained and largely non-murderous domestic policy\\". He notes the exceptions being the Khmer Rouge (in relative terms) and Mao's rule in China (in absolute terms). Stephen G. Wheatcroft asserts that prior to the opening of the Soviet archives for historical research, \\"our understanding of the scale and the nature of Soviet repression has been extremely poor\\" and that some scholars who wish to maintain pre-1991 high estimates are \\"finding it difficult to adapt to the new circumstances when the archives are open and when there are plenty of irrefutable data\\" and instead \\"hang on to their old Sovietological methods with round-about calculations based on odd statements from emigres and other informants who are supposed to have superior knowledge\\", although he acknowledged that even the figures estimated from the additional documents are not \\"final or definitive\\". In the 2007 revision of his book The Great Terror, Robert Conquest estimates that while exact numbers will never be certain, the communist leaders of the Soviet Union were responsible for no fewer than 15 million deaths. Some historians attempt to make separate estimates for different periods of Soviet history, with casualty estimates varying widely from 6 million (for the Stalinist period) to 8.1 million (for a period ending in 1937) to 20 million to 61 million (for the period 1917-1987).  Red Terror  The Red Terror was a period of political repression and executions carried out by Bolsheviks after the beginning of the Russian Civil War in 1918. During this period, the political police (the Cheka) conducted summary executions of tens of thousands of \\"enemies of the people\\". Many victims were \\"bourgeois hostages\\" rounded up and held in readiness for summary execution in reprisal for any alleged counter-revolutionary provocation. Many were put to death during and after the suppression of revolts, such as the Kronstadt rebellion of Baltic Fleet sailors and the Tambov Rebellion of Russian peasants. Professor Donald Rayfield claims that \\"the repression that followed the rebellions in Kronstadt and Tambov alone resulted in tens of thousands of executions\\". A large number of Orthodox clergymen were also killed. According to Nicolas Werth, the policy of decossackization amounted to an attempt by Soviet leaders to \\"eliminate, exterminate, and deport the population of a whole territory\\". In the early months of 1919, perhaps 10,000 to 12,000 Cossacks were executed and many more deported after their villages were razed to the ground. According to historian Michael Kort: \\"During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 1.5 million Don Cossacks, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000\\".  Joseph Stalin  Estimates on the number of deaths brought about by Stalin's rule are hotly debated by scholars in the field of Soviet and Communist studies. Prior to the collapse of the USSR and the archival revelations, some historians estimated that the numbers killed by Stalin's regime were 20 million or higher. Michael Parenti writes that estimates on the Stalinist death toll vary widely in part because such estimates are based on \\"anecdotes\\" in absence of reliable evidence and \\"speculations by writers who never reveal how they arrive at such figures\\". After the Soviet Union dissolved, evidence from the Soviet archives became available, containing official records of the execution of approximately 800,000 prisoners under Stalin for either political or criminal offenses, around 1.7 million deaths in the Gulags and some 390,000 deaths during kulak forced resettlement‚Äîfor a total of about 3 million officially recorded victims in these categories. However, official Soviet documentation of Gulag deaths is widely considered inadequate. Golfo Alexopoulos, Anne Applebaum, Oleg Khlevniuk and Michael Ellman write that the government frequently released prisoners on the edge of death in order to avoid officially counting them. A 1993 study of archival data by J. Arch Getty et al. showed that a total of 1,053,829 people died in the Gulag from 1934 to 1953. Subsequently, Steven Rosefielde asserted that this number has to be augmented by 19.4 percent in light of more complete archival evidence to 1,258,537, with the best estimate of Gulag deaths being 1.6 million from 1929 to 1953 when excess mortality is taken into account. Alexopolous estimates a much higher total of at least 6 million dying in the Gulag or shortly after release. Jeffrey Hardy has criticized Alexopoulos as basing her assertions primarily on indirect and misinterpreted evidence and Dan Healey has called her work a \\"challenge to the emergent scholarly consensus\\". According to historian Stephen G. Wheatcroft, Stalin's regime can be charged with causing the \\"purposive deaths\\" of about a million people. Wheatcroft excludes all famine deaths as \\"purposive deaths\\" and claims those that do qualify fit more closely the category of \\"execution\\" rather than \\"murder\\". Others posit that some of the actions of Stalin's regime, not only those during the Holodomor, but also dekulakization and targeted campaigns against particular ethnic groups, can be considered as genocide at least in its loose definition. Modern data for the whole of Stalin's rule was summarized by Timothy Snyder, who concluded that Stalinism caused six million direct deaths and nine million in total, including the deaths from deportation, hunger and Gulag deaths. Michael Ellman attributes roughly 3 million deaths to the Stalinist regime, excluding excess mortality from famine, disease and war. Several scholars, among them Stalin biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore, Soviet/Russian historian Dmitri Volkogonov, and the director of Yale's \\"Annals of Communism\\" series Jonathan Brent, put the death toll from Stalin at about 20 million.. = Mass deportations of ethnic minorities = Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and Lavrenti Beria (in foreground), who was responsible for mass deportations of ethnic minorities as head of the NKVD The Soviet government during Joseph Stalin's rule conducted a series of deportations on an enormous scale that significantly affected the ethnic map of the Soviet Union. Deportations took place under extremely harsh conditions, often in cattle carriages, with hundreds of thousands of deportees dying en route. Some experts estimate that the proportion of deaths from the deportations could be as high as one in three in certain cases. Raphael Lemkin, a lawyer of Polish-Jewish descent who initiated the Genocide Convention and coined the term genocide himself, assumed that genocide was perpetrated in the context of the mass deportation of the Chechens, Ingush, Volga Germans, Crimean Tatars, Kalmyks and Karachay. Regarding the fate of the Crimean Tatars, Amir Weiner of Stanford University writes that the policy could be classified as \\"ethnic cleansing\\". In the book Century of Genocide, Lyman H Legters writes: \\"We cannot properly speak of a completed genocide, only of a process that was genocidal in its potentiality\\". In contrast to this view, Jon K. Chang contends that the deportations had been in fact based on genocides based on ethnicity and that \\"social historians\\" in the West have failed to champion the rights of marginalized ethnicities in the Soviet Union. This view is supported by several countries. On 12 December 2015, the Ukrainian Parliament issued a resolution recognizing the deportation of Crimean Tatars as genocide and established 18 May as the Day of Remembrance for the victims of the Crimean Tatar Genocide. The parliament of Latvia recognized the event as an act of genocide on 9 May 2019. The Parliament of Lithuania did the same on 6 June 2019. Canadian Parliament passed a motion on June 10, 2019, recognizing the Crimean Tatar deportation of 1944 (S√ºrg√ºnlik) as a genocide perpetrated by Soviet dictator Stalin, designating May 18 to be a day of remembrance. The deportation of Chechens and Ingush was acknowledged by the European Parliament as an act of genocide in 2004, stating: = Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933 = Within the Soviet Union, forced changes in agricultural policies (collectivization), confiscations of grain and droughts caused the Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933 in Ukraine, Northern Caucasus, Volga Region and Kazakhstan. The famine was most severe in the Ukrainian SSR, where it is often referenced as the Holodomor. A significant portion of the famine victims (3.3 to 7.5 million) were Ukrainians. Another part of the famine was known as Kazakh catastrophe, when more than 1.3 million ethnic Kazakhs (about 38% of the population) died. Many scholars say that the Stalinist policies that caused the famine may have been designed as an attack on the rise of Ukrainian nationalism and thus may fall under the legal definition of genocide. The famine was officially recognized as genocide by the Ukraine and other governments. In a draft resolution, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe declared the famine was caused by the \\"cruel and deliberate actions and policies of the Soviet regime\\" and was responsible for the deaths of \\"millions of innocent people\\" in Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Russia. Relative to its population, Kazakhstan is believed to have been the most adversely affected. Regarding the Kazakh catastrophe, Michael Ellman states that it \\"seems to be an example of ‚Äònegligent genocide‚Äô which falls outside the scope of the UN Convention of genocide\\". = Great Purge (Yezhovshchina)= Mass graves dating from 1937‚Äì1938 opened up and hundreds of bodies exhumed for identification by family members Stalin's attempts to solidify his position as leader of the Soviet Union led to an escalation of detentions and executions, climaxing in 1937‚Äì1938 (a period sometimes referred to as the Yezhovshchina, or Yezhov era) and continuing until Stalin's death in 1953. Around 700,000 of these were executed by a gunshot to the back of the head. Others perished from beatings and torture while in \\"investigative custody\\" and in the Gulag due to starvation, disease, exposure and overwork. Arrests were typically made citing counter-revolutionary laws, which included failure to report treasonous actions and in an amendment added in 1937 failing to fulfill one's appointed duties. In the cases investigated by the State Security Department of the NKVD from October 1936 to November 1938, at least 1,710,000 people were arrested and 724,000 people executed. Modern historical studies estimate a total number of repression deaths during 1937‚Äì1938 as 950,000‚Äì1,200,000. These figures take into account the incompleteness of official archival data and include both execution deaths and Gulag deaths during that period. Former \\"kulaks\\" and their families made up the majority of victims, with 669,929 people arrested and 376,202 executed. The NKVD conducted a series of \\"national operations\\" which targeted some ethnic groups. A total of 350,000 were arrested and 247,157 were executed. Of these, the Polish operation which targeted the members of Polska Organizacja Wojskowa appears to have been the largest, with 140,000 arrests and 111,000 executions. Although these operations might well constitute genocide as defined by the UN convention, or \\"a mini-genocide\\" according to Simon Sebag Montefiore, there is as yet no authoritative ruling on the legal characterization of these events. Citing church documents, Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev has estimated that over 100,000 priests, monks and nuns were executed during this time. Regarding the persecution of clergy, Michael Ellman has stated that \\"the 1937‚Äì38 terror against the clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church and of other religions (Binner & Junge 2004) might also qualify as genocide\\". In the summer and autumn of 1937, Stalin sent NKVD agents to the Mongolian People's Republic and engineered a Mongolian Great Terror in which some 22,000 or 35,000 people were executed. Around 18,000 victims were Buddhist lamas. In Belarus, mass graves for several thousand civilians killed by the NKVD between 1937 and 1941 were discovered in 1988 at Kurapaty. = Soviet killings during World War II = Following the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, NKVD task forces started removing \\"Soviet-hostile elements\\" from the conquered territories. The NKVD systematically practiced torture which often resulted in death. According to the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, 150,000 Polish citizens perished due to Soviet repression during the war. The most notorious killings occurred in the spring of 1940, when the NKVD executed some 21,857 Polish POWs and intellectual leaders in what has become known as the Katyn massacre. Executions were also carried out after the annexation of the Baltic states. During the initial phases of Operation Barbarossa, the NKVD and attached units of the Red Army massacred prisoners and political opponents by the tens of thousands before fleeing from the advancing Axis forces. Memorial complexes have been built at NKVD execution sites at Katyn and Mednoye in Russia, as well as a \\"third killing field\\" at Piatykhatky, Ukraine.

There is a general consensus among historians that after Mao Zedong seized power, his policies and political purges directly or indirectly caused the deaths of tens of millions of people. Based on the Soviets' experience, Mao considered violence to be necessary in order to achieve an ideal society that would be derived from Marxism and as a result he planned and executed violence on a grand scale.  Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries  The first large- scale killings under Mao took place during his land reform and the counterrevolutionary campaign. In official study materials that were published in 1948, Mao envisaged that \\"one-tenth of the peasants\\" (or about 50,000,000) \\"would have to be destroyed\\" to facilitate agrarian reform. The exact number of people who were killed during Mao's land reform is believed to have been lower, but at least one million people were killed. The suppression of counterrevolutionaries targeted mainly former Kuomintang officials and intellectuals who were suspected of disloyalty. At least 712,000 people were executed and 1,290,000 were imprisoned in labor camps.  Great Leap Forward and the Great Chinese Famine  Benjamin Valentino claims that the Great Leap Forward was a cause of the Great Chinese Famine and the worst effects of the famine were steered towards the regime's enemies. Those who were labeled \\"black elements\\" (religious leaders, rightists and rich peasants) in earlier campaigns died in the greatest numbers because they were given the lowest priority in the allocation of food. In Mao's Great Famine, historian Frank Dik√∂tter writes that \\"coercion, terror, and systematic violence were the very foundation of the Great Leap Forward\\" and it \\"motivated one of the most deadly mass killings of human history\\". Dik√∂tter estimates that at least 2.5 million people were summarily killed or tortured to death during this period. His research in local and provincial Chinese archives indicates the death toll was at least 45 million: \\"In most cases the party knew very well that it was starving its own people to death\\". In a secret meeting at Shanghai in 1959, Mao issued the order to procure one third of all grain from the countryside, saying: \\"When there is not enough to eat people starve to death. It is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill\\". In light of additional evidence of Mao's culpability, Rummel added those killed by the Great Famine to his total for Mao's democide for a total of 77 million killed.  Cultural Revolution  Sinologists Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals estimate that between 750,000 and 1.5 million people were killed in the violence of the Cultural Revolution in rural China alone. Mao's Red Guards were given carte blanche to abuse and kill people who were perceived to be enemies of the revolution. For example, in August 1966, over 100 teachers were murdered by their students in western Beijing.  Tibet  According to Jean-Louis Margolin in The Black Book of Communism, the Chinese communists carried out a cultural genocide against the Tibetans. Margolin states that the killings were proportionally larger in Tibet than they were in China proper and \\"one can legitimately speak of genocidal massacres because of the numbers that were involved\\". According to the Dalai Lama and the Central Tibetan Administration, \\"Tibetans were not only shot, but they were also beaten to death, crucified, burned alive, drowned, mutilated, starved, strangled, hanged, boiled alive, buried alive, drawn and quartered, and beheaded\\". Adam Jones, a scholar who specializes in genocide, notes that after the 1959 Tibetan uprising the Chinese authorized struggle sessions against reactionaries, during which \\"communist cadres denounced, tortured, and frequently executed enemies of the people\\". These sessions resulted in 92,000 deaths out of a total population of about 6 million. These deaths, Jones stressed, may not only be seen as a genocide, but they may also be seen as an \\"eliticide\\", meaning \\"targeting the better educated and leadership oriented elements among the Tibetan population\\". Patrick French, the former director of the Free Tibet Campaign in London, writes that the Free Tibet Campaign and other groups have claimed that a total of 1.2 million Tibetans were killed by the Chinese since 1950 but after examining archives in Dharamsala, he found \\"no evidence to support that figure\\". French states that a reliable alternative number is unlikely to be known, but he estimates that as many as half a million Tibetans died \\"as a 'direct result' of the policies of the People's Republic of China\\" by using historian Warren Smith's estimate of 200,000 people who are missing from population statistics in the Tibet Autonomous Region and extending that rate to the borderland regions.  Tiananmen Square  Jean-Louis Margolin states that, under Deng Xiaoping, at least 1,000 people were killed in Beijing and hundreds more were executed in the countryside after his government crushed demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989. According to Louisa Lim in 2014, a group of victims' relatives in China called the \\"Tiananmen Mothers\\" has confirmed the identities of more than 200 of those who were killed. Alex Bellamy writes that this \\"tragedy marks the last time in which an episode of mass killing in East Asia was terminated by the perpetrators themselves, judging that they had succeeded.\\" File:June 4th Museum Photo taking area 2016.jpgReplica of the Goddess of Democracy statue in Hong Kong's June 4th Museum File:Wroclaw-pomnik Tien-An- Men.jpgA memorial to the 1989 Tiananmen Square events in the Dominican Square in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland File:Tiananmen estatua.JPGStatue located in √Åvila, Spain recalling the events of Tiananmen Square = Cambodia = Skulls of victims of the Khmer Rouge Killing Fields in Cambodia The Killing Fields are a number of sites in Cambodia where large numbers of people were killed and buried by the Khmer Rouge regime during its rule of the country from 1975 to 1979, after the end of the Cambodian Civil War. Sociologist Martin Shaw described the Cambodian genocide as \\"the purest genocide of the Cold War era\\". The results of a demographic study of the Cambodian genocide concluded that the nationwide death toll from 1975 to 1979 amounted to 1,671,000 to 1,871,000, or 21 to 24 percent of the total Cambodian population before the Khmer Rouge took power. According to Ben Kiernan, the number of deaths which were specifically caused by execution is still unknown because many victims died from starvation, disease and overwork. Researcher Craig Etcheson of the Documentation Center of Cambodia suggests that the death toll was between 2 and 2.5 million, with a \\"most likely\\" figure of 2.2 million. After spending five years researching about 20,000 grave sites, he concluded that \\"these mass graves contain the remains of 1,112,829 victims of execution\\". A study by French demographer Marek Sliwinski calculated slightly fewer than 2 million unnatural deaths under the Khmer Rouge out of a 1975 Cambodian population of 7.8 million, with 33.5% of Cambodian men dying under the Khmer Rouge compared to 15.7% of Cambodian women. The number of suspected victims of execution who were found in 23,745 mass graves is estimated to be 1.3 million according to a 2009 academic source. Execution is believed to account for roughly 60% of the total death toll during the genocide, with other victims succumbing to starvation or disease. Helen Fein, a genocide scholar, states that the xenophobic ideology of the Khmer Rouge regime bears a stronger resemblance to a phenomenon of national socialism, or fascism. Responding to Ben Kiernan's \\"argument that Pol Pot's Democratic Kampuchea regime was more racist and generically totalitarian than Marxist or specifically Communist\\", Steve Heder states that the example of such racialist thought relative to the minority Cham people echoed \\"Marx's definition of a historyless people doomed to extinction in the name of progress\\" and were a part of general concepts of class and class struggle. French historian Henri Locard argues that the \\"fascist\\" label was applied to the Khmer Rouge by its enemies, the Vietnamese communists, as a form of \\"revisionism\\", but the repression under the Khmer Rouge was \\"similar (if significantly more lethal) to the repression in all communist regimes\\". Daniel Goldhagen explains that the Khmer Rouge were xenophobic because they believed that the Khmer were \\"the one authentic people capable of building true communism\\". Steven Rosefielde claims that Democratic Kampuchea was the deadliest of all communist regimes on a per capita basis, primarily because it \\"lacked a viable productive core\\" and it \\"failed to set boundaries on mass murder\\".

He states that most regimes that described themselves as communist did not commit mass killings. Frank W. Wayman and Atsushi Tago write that, because \\"democide\\" is broader than \\"mass killing\\" or \\"genocide\\", most communist regimes can be said to have engaged in it, including the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, North Vietnam, East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, North Korea, Cuba, Laos, Albania, and Yugoslavia.  People's Republic of Bulgaria  According to Benjamin Valentino, available evidence suggests that between 50,000 and 100,000 people may have been killed in Bulgaria beginning in 1944 as part of agricultural collectivization and political repression, although there is insufficient documentation to make a definitive judgement. In his book History of Communism in Bulgaria, Dinyu Sharlanov accounts for about 31,000 people killed under the regime between 1944 and 1989.  East Germany  According to Valentino, between 80,000 and 100,000 people may have been killed in East Germany beginning in 1945 as part of the Soviet Union's denazification campaign, but other scholars argue that these figures are inflated. A memorial to dead prisoners at an NKVD special camp in Germany Immediately after World War II, denazification commenced in occupied Germany and the regions which the Nazis had annexed. In the Soviet occupation zone, the NKVD established prison camps, usually in abandoned concentration camps, and they used them to intern alleged Nazis and Nazi German officials along with some landlords and Prussian Junkers. According to files and data which was released by the Soviet Ministry for the Interior in 1990, all in all, 123,000 Germans and 35,000 citizens of other nations were detained. Of these prisoners, a total of 786 people were shot and 43,035 people died of various causes. Most of the deaths were not direct killings, instead, they were caused by outbreaks of dysentery and tuberculosis. Death from starvation also occurred on a large scale, particularly from late 1946 to early 1947, but these deaths do not appear to have been deliberate killings because food shortages were widespread in the Soviet occupation zone. The prisoners of the \\"silence camps\\", as the NKVD special camps were called, did not have access to the black market and as a result, they were only able to get food that was handed to them by the authorities. Some prisoners were executed and other prisoners may have been tortured to death. In this context, it is difficult to determine if the prisoner deaths in the silence camps can be categorized as mass killings. It is also difficult to determine how many of the dead were German, East German, or members of other nationalities. In 1961, East Germany erected the Berlin Wall following the Berlin crisis. Even though crossing between East Germany and West Germany was possible for motivated and approved travelers, thousands of East Germans tried to defect by illegally crossing the wall. Of these, between 136 and 227 people were killed by the Berlin Wall guards during the years of the wall's existence (1961-1989).  Socialist Republic of Romania  According to Valentino, between 60,000 and 300,000 people may have been killed in Romania beginning in 1945 as part of agricultural collectivization and political repression.  Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  Josip Broz Tito made bloody repression and several massacres of POW after second world war; European Public Hearing on \\"Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes\\" reports: \\"The decision to \\"annihilate\\" opponents must had been adopted in the closest circles of Yugoslav state leadership, and the order was certainly issued by the Supreme Commander of the Yugoslav Army Josip Broz Tito, although it is not known when or in what form\\". Dominic McGoldrick writes that as the head of a \\"highly centralised and oppressive\\" dictatorship, Broz Tito wielded tremendous power in Yugoslavia, with his dictatorial rule administered through an elaborate bureaucracy which routinely suppressed human rights. Eliott Behar states that \\"Tito's Yugoslavia was a tightly controlled police state\\". According to David Mates, outside the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia had more political prisoners than all of the rest of Eastern Europe combined. Tito's secret police was modelled on the Soviet KGB. Its members were ever- present and often acted extrajudicially, with victims including middle-class intellectuals, liberals and democrats. Yugoslavia was a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but scant regard was paid to some of its provisions.  North Korea  According to Rummel, forced labor, executions and concentration camps were responsible for over one million deaths in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from 1948 to 1987. Others have estimated 400,000 deaths in concentration camps alone. A wide range of atrocities have been committed in the camps including forced abortions, infanticide and torture. Former International Criminal Court judge Thomas Buergenthal, who was one of the UN report's authors and a child survivor of Auschwitz, told The Washington Post \\"that conditions in the [North] Korean prison camps are as terrible, or even worse, than those I saw and experienced in my youth in these Nazi camps and in my long professional career in the human rights field\\". Pierre Rigoulot estimates 100,000 executions, 1.5 million deaths through concentration camps and slave labor, and 500,000 deaths from famine. The famine, which claimed as many as one million lives, has been described as the result of the economic policies of the North Korean government and deliberate \\"terror-starvation\\". In 2010, Steven Rosefielde stated that the \\"Red Holocaust\\" \\"still persists in North Korea\\" as Kim Jong Il \\"refuses to abandon mass killing\\". Adam Jones cites journalist Jasper Becker that the famine was a form of mass killing or genocide due to political manipulations of the food. Estimates based on a North Korean 2008 census suggest 240,000 to 420,000 excess deaths as a result of the 1990s famine and a demographic impact of 600,000 to 850,000 fewer people in North Korea in 2008 as a result of poor living conditions after the famine.  Vietnam  Valentino attributes 80,000‚Äì200,000 deaths to \\"communist mass killings\\" in North and South Vietnam. According to scholarship based on Vietnamese and Hungarian archival evidence, as many as 15,000 suspected landlords were executed during North Vietnam's land reform from 1953 to 1956. The North Vietnamese leadership planned in advance to execute 0.1% of North Vietnam's population (estimated at 13.5 million in 1955) as \\"reactionary or evil landlords\\", although this ratio could vary in practice. Dramatic errors were committed in the course of the land reform campaign. Vu Tuong states that the number of executions during North Vietnam's land reform was proportionally comparable to executions during Chinese land reform from 1949 to 1952.  Cuba  According to Jay Ulfelder and Benjamin Valentino, the Castro government of Cuba killed between 5,000 and 8,335 noncombatants as part of political repression between 1959 and 1970. According to Amnesty International, official death sentences under the Castro government from 1959‚Äì87 numbered 237 of which all but 21 were actually carried out.  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  According to Frank Wayman and Atsushi Tago, although frequently considered an example of communist genocide, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan represents a borderline case. Prior to the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan executed between 10,000 and 27,000 people, mostly at Pul-e-Charkhi prison. Mass graves of executed prisoners have been exhumed dating back to the Soviet era. After the invasion in 1979, the Soviets installed the puppet government of Babrak Karmal. By 1987, about 80% of the country's territory was permanently controlled by neither the pro-communist government and supporting Soviet troops nor by the armed opposition. To tip the balance, the Soviet Union used a tactic that was a combination of \\"scorched earth\\" policy and \\"migratory genocide\\". By systematically burning the crops and destroying villages in rebel provinces as well as by reprisal bombing entire villages suspected of harboring or supporting the resistance, the Soviets tried to force the local population to move to Soviet controlled territory, thereby depriving the armed opposition of support. Valentino attributes between 950,000 and 1,280,000 civilian deaths to the Soviet invasion and occupation of the country between 1978 and 1989, primarily as counter-guerrilla mass killing. By the early 1990s, approximately one-third of Afghanistan's population had fled the country. M. Hassan Kakar said that \\"the Afghans are among the latest victims of genocide by a superpower\\".  People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia  Amnesty International estimates that half a million people were killed during the Ethiopian Red Terror of 1977 and 1978. During the terror, groups of people were herded into churches that were then burned down and women were subjected to systematic rape by soldiers. The Save the Children Fund reported that victims of the Red Terror included not only adults, but 1,000 or more children, mostly aged between eleven and thirteen, whose corpses were left in the streets of Addis Ababa. Mengistu Haile Mariam himself is alleged to have killed political opponents with his bare hands.  Debate over famines  Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933, with areas of most disastrous famine shaded According to historian J. Arch Getty, over half of the 100 million deaths which are attributed to communism were due to famines. St√©phane Courtois argues that many communist regimes caused famines in their efforts to forcibly collectivize agriculture and systematically used it as a weapon by controlling the food supply and distributing food on a political basis. He states that \\"in the period after 1918, only Communist countries experienced such famines, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, and in some cases millions, of people. And again in the 1980s, two African countries that claimed to be Marxist-Leninist, Ethiopia and Mozambique, were the only such countries to suffer these deadly famines.\\" Scholars Stephen G. Wheatcroft, R. W. Davies, and Mark Tauger reject the idea that the Ukrainian famine was an act of genocide that was intentionally inflicted by the Soviet government. Getty posits that the \\"overwhelming weight of opinion among scholars working in the new archives is that the terrible famine of the 1930s was the result of Stalinist bungling and rigidity rather than some genocidal plan\\". Russian novelist and historian Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn opined on 2 April 2008 in Izvestia that the 1930s famine in the Ukraine was no different from the Russian famine of 1921 as both were caused by the ruthless robbery of peasants by Bolshevik grain procurements. Pankaj Mishra questions Mao's direct responsibility for famine, noting: \\"A great many premature deaths also occurred in newly independent nations not ruled by erratic tyrants\\". Mishra cites Nobel laureate Amartya Sen's research demonstrating that democratic India suffered more excess mortality from starvation and disease in the second half of the 20th century than China did. Sen wrote that \\"India seems to manage to fill its cupboard with more skeletons every eight years than China put there in its years of shame\\". Benjamin Valentino writes: \\"Although not all the deaths due to famine in these cases were intentional, communist leaders directed the worst effects of famine against their suspected enemies and used hunger as a weapon to force millions of people to conform to the directives of the state\\". Daniel Goldhagen says that in some cases deaths from famine should not be distinguished from mass murder: \\"Whenever governments have not alleviated famine conditions, political leaders decided not to say no to mass death ‚Äì in other words, they said yes\\". He claims that famine was either used or deliberately tolerated by the Soviets, the Germans, the communist Chinese, the British in Kenya, the Hausa against the Ibo in Nigeria, Khmer Rouge, communist North Koreans, Ethiopeans in Eritrea, Zimbabwe against regions of political opposition and political Islamists in southern Sudan and Darfur. Authors including Seumas Milne and Jon Wiener have criticized the emphasis on communism and the exclusion of colonialism when assigning blame for famines. Milne argues that if the Soviets are considered responsible for deaths caused by famine in the 1920s and 1930s, then Britain would be responsible for as many as 30 million deaths in India from famine during the 19th century, lamenting: \\"There is a much-lauded Black Book of Communism, but no such comprehensive indictment of the colonial record\\". Weiner makes a similar assertion while comparing the Ukrainian famine and the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that Winston Churchill's role in the Bengal famine \\"seems similar to Stalin's role in the Ukrainian famine\\". Historian Mike Davis, author of Late Victorian Holocausts, draws comparisons between the Great Chinese Famine and the Indian famines of the late 19th century and argues that both the Maoist regime and the British Empire share the same level of criminal responsibility for these events respectively. Michael Ellman is critical of the fixation on a \\"uniquely Stalinist evil\\" when it comes to excess deaths from famines and asserts that catastrophic famines were widespread in the 19th and 20th centuries, such as \\"in the British empire (India and Ireland), China, Russia and elsewhere\\". He argues that a possible defense of Stalin and his associates is that \\"their behaviour was no worse than that of many rulers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries\\". He also draws comparisons to the actions of the Group of Eight (G8) in recent decades, saying \\"the world-wide death of millions of people in recent decades which could have been prevented by simple public health measures or cured by application of modern medicine, but was not, might be considered by some as mass manslaughter‚Äîor mass death by criminal negligence‚Äîby the leaders of the G8 (who could have prevented these deaths but did not do so)\\".  Legal status and prosecutions  According to a 1992 constitutional amendment in the Czech Republic, a person who publicly denies, puts in doubt, approves, or tries to justify Nazi or communist genocide or other crimes of Nazis or communists will be punished with a prison term of 6 months to 3 years. Barbara Harff wrote in 1992 that no communist country or governing body has ever been convicted of genocide. In his 1999 foreword to The Black Book of Communism, Martin Malia wrote: \\"Throughout the former Communist world, moreover, virtually none of its responsible officials has been put on trial or punished. Indeed, everywhere Communist parties, though usually under new names, compete in politics\\". Mengistu Haile Mariam, the former communist leader of Ethiopia At the conclusion of a trial lasting from 1994 to 2006, Ethiopia's former ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam was convicted of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by an Ethiopian court for his role in Ethiopia's Red Terror. Ethiopian law is distinct from the UN and other definitions in that it defines genocide as intent to wipe out political and not just ethnic groups. In this respect, it closely resembles the definition of politicide. In 1997, the Cambodian government asked the United Nations for assistance in setting up a genocide tribunal. The prosecution presented the names of five possible suspects to the investigating judges on July 18, 2007. On July 26, 2010, Kang Kek Iew (Comrade Duch), director of the S-21 prison camp in Democratic Kampuchea where more than 14,000 people were tortured and then murdered (mostly at nearby Choeung Ek), was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 35 years. His sentence was reduced to 19 years in part because he had been behind bars for 11 years. Nuon Chea, second in command of the Khmer Rouge and its most senior surviving member, was charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity, but not charged with genocide. On August 7, 2014, he was convicted of crimes against humanity by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal and received a life sentence. In August 2007, Arnold Meri, an Estonian Red Army veteran and cousin of former Estonian President Lennart Meri, faced charges of genocide by Estonian authorities for participating in the deportations of Estonians in Hiiumaa in 1949. Meri denied the accusation, characterizing them as politically motivated defamation, saying: \\"I do not consider myself guilty of genocide\\". The trial was halted when Meri died March 27, 2009 at the age of 89. On November 26, 2010, the Russian State Duma issued a declaration acknowledging Stalin's responsibility for the Katyn massacre, the execution of over 21,000 Polish POW's and intellectual leaders by Stalin's NKVD. The declaration stated that archival material \\"not only unveils the scale of his horrific tragedy but also provides evidence that the Katyn crime was committed on direct orders from Stalin and other Soviet leaders\\".  Memorials and museums  Map of Stalin's Gulag camps in Gulag Museum in Moscow, founded in 2001 by historian Anton Antonov-Ovseyenko Monuments to the victims of communism exist in almost all the capitals of Eastern Europe and there are several museums documenting communist rule, such as the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights in Lithuania, the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia in Riga and the House of Terror in Budapest, all three of which also document Nazi rule. In Washington D.C., a bronze statue based upon the 1989 Tiananmen Square Goddess of Democracy sculpture was dedicated as the Victims of Communism Memorial in 2007, having been authorized by the Congress in 1993. The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation plans to build an International Museum on Communism in Washington. As of 2008, Russia contained 627 memorials and memorial plaques dedicated to victims of the communist terror, most of which were created by private citizens, and did not have a national monument or a national museum. The Wall of Grief in Moscow, inaugurated in October 2017, is Russia's first monument for victims of political persecution by Joseph Stalin during the country's Soviet era. In 2017, Canada's National Capital Commission approved the design for a memorial to the victims of communism to be built at the Garden of the Provinces and Territories in Ottawa. On August 23, 2018, Estonia's Victims of Communism 1940‚Äì1991 Memorial was inaugurated in Tallinn by President Kersti Kaljulaid. The memorial construction was financed by the state and is managed by the Estonian Institute of Historical Memory. The opening ceremony was chosen to coincide with the official EU European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism.

In 1970, Soviet diplomats who were accredited to Mozambique travelled to Eswatini on an unofficial basis, and raised the question of the establishment of official relations between the countries. Swazi King Sobhuza II, under pressure from the South African government, refused to establish such relations. On 3 May 1995, Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a presidential decree instructing the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to prepare the necessary notes to establish diplomatic relations with the Kingdom. On 19 November 1999, the Russian Federation and Eswatini officially established diplomatic relations, when the ambassadors of the two countries to Mozambique met in Maputo and exchanged diplomatic notes. In 2008, bilateral trade amounted to approximately US$1 million, up from the 2007 amount of US$644,000.

Stratton, a member of the United States House of Representatives from New York's 35th congressional district, was considered the most likely Democratic candidate. At first, Kennedy resisted. After President Kennedy's assassination, Robert Kennedy remained as Attorney General for Lyndon B. Johnson. However, Johnson and Kennedy feuded. Kennedy decided to run for the Senate in New York in August, and resigned from the Cabinet on September 3, 1964. While many reform Democrats resisted Kennedy, support from Robert F. Wagner, Jr., and party bosses like Charles A. Buckley, of The Bronx, and Peter J. Crotty,Peter J. Crotty (ca. 1910-1992), lawyer, of Buffalo, President of the Buffalo City Council 1948-51, Peter J. Crotty, Democratic Force In Western New York, Dies at 82 in NYT on March 4, 1992 of Buffalo, helped Kennedy win the nomination at the party convention.The Carpetbagger, 1964 in NYT on February 23, 1999 During the campaign, Kennedy was frequently met by large crowds. Keating accused Kennedy of being a carpetbagger from Massachusetts. Kennedy responded to these charges in a televised town meeting by saying, \\"If the senator of the state of New York is going be selected on who's lived here the longest, then I think people are going vote for my opponent. If it's going be selected on who's got the best New York accent, then I think I'm probably out too. But I think if it's going be selected on the basis of who can make the best United States senator, I think I'm still in the contest.\\" Results The Democratic/Liberal candidate was elected. Campaign help from President Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as the Democratic landslide after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, helped carry Kennedy into office, as Kennedy polled about 1.1 million votes less in New York than Johnson did. The incumbent Keating was defeated.

Baudelaire also wrote a poem entitled \\"Le L√©th√©\\" (\\"Lethe\\"), in which an adored but cruel woman serves as a metaphor for the oblivion of the river Lethe. French Romantic poet Alphonse de Lamartine refers to the Lethe river in \\"Le Vallon\\" (The Vale) > J'ai trop vu, trop senti, trop aim√© dans ma vie; Je viens chercher vivant le > calme du L√©th√©. (I have seen too much, felt too much, loved too much in my > life; I come to seek, still living, the calm of Lethe.) Pushkin's verse novel \\"Eugene Onegin\\" also contains three separate references to the Lethe (–õ–µ—Ç–∞) including this most poignant one in Lensky's soliloquy in Chapter 6, Stanza XXII as he awaits his fate at the dueling ground: > –ê —è, –±—ã—Ç—å –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç, —è –≥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –°–æ–π–¥—É –≤ —Ç–∞–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—É—é —Å–µ–Ω—å, –ò –ø–∞–º—è—Ç—å —é–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ—ç—Ç–∞ > –ü–æ–≥–ª–æ—Ç–∏—Ç –º–µ–¥–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –õ–µ—Ç–∞, –ó–∞–±—É–¥–µ—Ç –º–∏—Ä –º–µ–Ω—è; > but I perhaps will be declining into the tomb's mysterious shade; the trail > the youthful poet followed by sluggish Lethe may be swallowed, and I be by > the world forgot; In Hymn to Proserpine (1866) by Algernon Charles Swinburne, the line \\"We have drunken of things Lethean...\\" laments the decline of pagan tradition and beliefs in ancient Rome following the endorsement of Christianity as the official religion. The river is also mentioned in at least one of the poems of Victorian classicist and poet A.E. Housman (XXIII from More Poems). > \\"Crossing alone the nighted ferry > With the one coin for fee, > Whom, on the wharf of Lethe waiting, > Count you to find? Not me. > > The brisk fond lackey to fetch and carry, > The true, sick-hearted slave, > Expect him not in the just city > And free land of the grave.\\" Here the role of the Lethe as the final barrier to be crossed before reaching Elysium is invoked (NB \\"Lethe\\" is better rhyme for \\"ferry\\" than is \\"Stix\\") and the poem as a whole seems to reflect the associations of the Lethe with forgetfulness and escape from ones former life. The Edna St. Vincent Millay poem \\"Lethe\\" describes the river as > \\"the taker-away of pain, > And the giver-back of beauty!\\" In \\"The Scarlet Woman\\", a poem by African-American poet Fenton Johnson (1888‚Äì1958), a young woman resorts to prostitution in order to avoid starvation.

Remember Thee!\\". In the Aeneid by Vergil, in book 6 Aeneas sees the future Roman heroes drinking from the River Lethe. \\"The drink the soothing fluid and long forgetfullness\\" Emily Dickinson mentions the \\"Lethe\\" in her poetry (#1730 by Thomas Johnson editing).

Distribution It is native to the western United States, in California, Nevada, Utah, and Oregon. It often grows in moist habitat, such as subalpine meadows and creeksides. It often carpets large areas of meadow and hillside with blue-green foliage and sweet-scented bluebell blooms.Southwest Colorado Wildflowers Description Mertensia ciliata is a perennial herb producing a cluster of erect stems from a thick, branching caudex. The leafy stems reach well over a meter in maximum height. The veiny leaves are oval to lance-shaped and pointed. The inflorescence is an open array of many clustered blue bell-shaped flowers each between 1 and 2 centimeters long. The hanging, fragrant flower is tubular, expanding into a wider, lobed mouth. As the individual flowers progress in age they change in color from blue to pink- red.Barker, Joan. The Ultimate Guide to Wild Flowers of North America, page 249. Parragon. 2013.

History  Anjodi is a Luxe motor Dutch steel barge built as a trading barge in Groningen, Netherlands in 1929 and originally carried grain. She was constructed of iron with a high copper content which has contributed to her longevity. She got the name Anjodi in 1963 after the names of the three children of the original owner, Tiemen de Weerd: Andries, Johan and Diana. Anjodi was purchased by Derek Banks in 1982 from a Dutchman, Fopa de Jong, in Amsterdam. She was a retired trading barge and full of old World War II aircraft instruments. The refit in 1982-1983, by European Waterways, made Anjodi one of France's first ever hotel barges. Before making the three-month trip from the Netherlands to the south of France, Anjodi was towed to a shipyard in Belgium where tanks for fresh water, generators, wiring and plumbing were installed and a shell infrastructure of steel was built. She is refurbished on an annual basis and currently operates on the Canal du Midi in southern France.  Hotel barge  Anjodi has four guest bedrooms with private bathrooms and a saloon.

Background Bureau, 1933-1934 Brooklyn Museum Occasional Table, 1937-1941 Brooklyn Museum Beginning in 1932, and continuing up to the time of his death in 1944, Rohde advised Herman Miller's president, Dirk Jan De Pree on design, marketing, and production. Herman Miller was one of a dozen furniture manufacturers where Rohde initiated modern design, among them the Heywood-Wakefield Company, the Widdicomb Company, and the Troy Sunshade Company. Rohde lived in New York City and its environs throughout his life. He was educated in New York City public schools, graduating in 1913 from Stuyvesant High School, which was known at the time for its rigorous vocational studies program. Post-high school studies included classes at the Art Students League and the Grand Central School of Art. A 1927 trip to France and Germany was the prelude to his career in design, and marked the transition from his work in advertising illustration to design. His work reflected American Streamline Moderne design, as well as trends in European art and design (he made two additional trips to Europe in 1931 and 1937), including French moderne, the International Design style associated with the Bauhaus, and later, Surrealism. His biomorphic tables and desks, made by Herman Miller, were the first examples of biomorphic furniture manufactured in America, anticipating forms that would define mid-century modernism. Advocate of Modernity Rohde was a tireless advocate for modern furniture and interiors in American homes, apartments, offices, and commercial and institutional settings. He designed many lines of modular furniture, promoted for its flexibility, functionality, and suitability for apartments and small homes. He became known for experimenting with industrial materials in furniture and interiors, including Plexiglas, Lucite, Bakelite, and Fabrikoid (a leather- like fabric made by DuPont). One of his most innovative designs was a molded Plexiglas chair made in 1939, and shown at the Rohm and Haas display at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Of the two prototypes of this chair, one was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in 2000. Rohde's work is included in major museum collections among them: the Brooklyn Museum, the Wolfsonian, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Henry Ford, the Newark Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Dallas Museum of Art. In Europe his work is owned by the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Vitra Design Museum. His Executive Office Group (EOG) line, launched in 1942 by Herman Miller, was the earliest example of a systems approach to office furniture. The line's 137 individual elements‚Äîdrawers, drawer pedestals, tabletops, and other items‚Äîcould be configured according to individual work requirements. It became the standard approach to high-end office furniture. In addition to his design work, Rohde taught industrial design, first at the Design Laboratory (1935‚Äì37), a New Deal program in New York City sponsored by the Works Progress Administration, where he also served as director. He subsequently taught at New York University, and was a visiting lecturer at the University of Washington in Seattle. He participated in the founding of the Society of Industrial Designers (now IDSA). Far Reaching Rohde's work was publicized through hundreds of articles in design and architecture magazines, newspapers, and in popular magazines such as House Beautiful. His work was featured at several fairs of the 1930s, including the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago in 1933 and 1934, and in the Decorative Arts Pavilion at San Francisco's 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. Consumers could purchase his furniture at upscale department stores in New York (Bloomingdale's), Washington (Woodward & Lothrop), Philadelphia (Wanamaker's), Cleveland (Halle Brothers Co.), and elsewhere. By focusing on design for mass production, Rohde hoped to make modern design the national style of America and to bring modern design to the greatest number of consumers. As part of its Pioneers of American Industrial Design series, the United States Postal Service issued on August 25, 2011 a commemorative first-class Forever stamp featuring a Rohde-designed clock.

People, especially the young, like to explore their surroundings but may not fully understand the dangers inherent within, and surrounding, a mine.  Reasons for mine capping  Cave-ins, poor air quality, wet slippery surfaces, etc. are real dangers when entering a mine, but even the surrounding area can be dangerous. Older mines may have been covered with logs or wooden beams with loose rock and soil over the top. These fail over time, creating sinkholes, that may not be visible on the surface, until enough weight collapses it.  Law requirements  Federal and State laws dictate certain aspects in the capping process, such as allowances for bats to have access. The type of mine, water table, geology, etc. are all considered when choosing which type of cap will be used for a given mine entrance. Types = Concrete caps = Concrete continues to be the preferred method for capping vertical shafts. Considerations can be made in the design to allow for an entrance to the mine, a steel door for humans, a slot for bats, a hole for airflow. The slabs thickness can vary from as little as 6 inches to several feet. = Expanding foam = Expanding foam is quickly replacing concrete for some vertical shafts, typically mines where an entrance for humans is no longer desired. This type of cap is sometimes referred to as a \\"Plug.\\" Plugs usually have a taper to them, smaller on the bottom and wider on the top, like the cork on a wine bottle. Expanding foam plugs need to be quite thick, usually no less than 6 feet deep. Typically, loose rock and soil is placed over the top. = Steel plates = Petherick Mine Cap (Horizontal Shaft), July, 2009 1/4 inch or thicker steel-plating is also used, on both horizontal and vertical shafts. These allow for easier customization than concrete, cutting access holes in steel is far easier than building the concrete forms necessary for the same result. This type of cap is used where easy access is a necessity. The photo at right is of a 1/4-inch steel-plating cap at the entrance to a horizontal shaft at the Petherick Mine, located in Keweenaw County, Michigan.

Emergency and election victory The Janata Party was formed by political leaders and activists of various political parties who had been united in opposing the state of emergency imposed in 1975 by then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. After elections were called in 1977, the Janata Party was formed from the union of the Congress (O), Swatantra Party, Socialist Party of India, Bharatiya Jana Sangh and the Lok Dal. Congress defector Jagjivan Ram, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna & Nandini Satpathy formed the Congress for Democracy and joined the Janata alliance.

The Constitution was amended to make it more difficult for any future government to declare a state of emergency; fundamental freedoms and the independence of India's judiciary was reaffirmed. The new government also proceeded to withdraw all charges against the 25 accused in the Baroda dynamite case, which included the new Minister of Industry, George Fernandes. The Minister of Railways reinstated the railway employees disciplined after the May 1974 strike. The Desai government proceeded to establish inquiry commissions and tribunals to investigate allegations of corruption and human rights abuses by members of Indira Gandhi's government, political party and the police forces. Specific inquiries were instituted on Sanjay Gandhi's management of the state-owned Maruti Udyog Ltd., the activities of the former Minister of Defence Bansi Lal and the 1971 Nagarwala scandal. Both Indira and her son Sanjay were charged with allegations of corruption and briefly arrested. Economic policy The Janata government had lesser success in achieving economic reforms. It launched the Sixth Five-Year Plan, aiming to boost agricultural production and rural industries. Seeking to promote economic self-reliance and indigenous industries, the government required multi-national corporations to go into partnership with Indian corporations. The policy proved controversial, diminishing foreign investment and led to the high-profile exit of corporations such as Coca-Cola and IBM from India. But the government was unable to address the issues of resurging inflation, fuel shortages, unemployment and poverty. The legalisation of strikes and re- empowerment of trade unions affected business efficiency and economic production. The Janata government tried to curb forgery and black money in India by demonetising notes of 1000, 5000 and 10000 Rupees on 16 January 1978. Many decades later, in November 2016, Modi government decided to demonetise 500 and 1000 rupee notes in an effort to stop the counterfeiting of the current banknotes alleged to be used for funding terrorism in India and for cracking down on black money in the country.

The film was released in the United Kingdom on 16 October 2009. George portrays a single mother who goes on a boating trip with several friends. When they are forced to abandon their ship, they board a derelict ocean liner, where they become convinced that someone is stalking them.  Plot  While preparing to take Tommy, her son with autism, on a boat trip along with her friend Greg, Jess hears the doorbell ring, but no one is there. She later arrives at a harbour in Florida without Tommy, explaining that he is at school, and boards Greg's boat. She meets Greg's married friends Sally and Downey, Sally's friend Heather, and Victor, a runaway teen living with Greg. While out at sea, the wind dies and a storm approaches, and they pick up a distress signal while radioing the coast guard. The storm capsizes the boat, during which Heather is swept out into the water, and the others climb onto the overturned boat when the storm clears. They board an ocean liner as it passes; it appears to be deserted, yet there is fresh food in a dining room. Jess experiences a growing sense of d√©j√† vu as they explore. They find Jess's keys in a corridor near a display case for Aeolus, the ship's namesake, leading Sally to believe Heather has also boarded. Jess soon spots someone watching them and Victor gives chase. She and Greg continue on and find \\"Go To Theater\\" written in blood on a mirror. After they part, she returns to the dining room, where the food is now rotting. Victor enters, covered in blood, and tries to kill Jess; she fights him off by aggravating a wound at the back of his head. She hears gunfire and follows it to a theater, where Greg lies dead of a gunshot. Sally and Downey tell Jess that Greg told them she shot him. They accuse her of sending them to the theater. A burlap-masked shooter kills them from a balcony and chases Jess to an outside deck; she fights back and disarms the shooter, who tells her \\"You have to kill them; it's the only way to get home\\" before falling overboard. She soon hears yelling and sees herself and the others alive on Greg's upturned boat. After they board, Jess becomes the earlier unseen figure: she drops her keys near the display case and is spotted shortly after. She attempts to warn Victor when he catches up to her, only to accidentally impale his head on a wall hook. She flees deeper into the ship and finds dozens of duplicates of the shooter's outfit, shotgun, her own locket, and a note saying to kill them all when they board. She takes a shotgun, intending to \\"change the pattern\\", but the shooter, another Jess, kills Greg and Downey before mortally wounding Sally with a knife. The first Jess chases Sally, who sends the distress signal heard on Greg's boat. Jess catches up to her on an upper deck filled with dozens of Sally corpses, and Sally succumbs to her wound as, below them, the newest Jess kills the shooter Jess. The overturned boat returns again, and Jess realises the loop restarts once everyone is killed. Desperate to stop and ultimately prevent the loop, Jess sets everything from the first loop into motion, with herself as the shooter. After she is disarmed during the fight on the front deck, she urges her counterpart to kill everyone when they return, and falls overboard. She awakens washed ashore and discovers that it is the same morning. She returns home and watches from outside her house as her double abuses Tommy out of anger toward his autism. Promising to change, she distracts her counterpart with the doorbell, then kills her, puts the bagged body in the car trunk, and leaves with Tommy. A gull hits their windscreen and dies, but when she picks it up and disposes of it, she sees a pile of dead gulls. Realising that she is still trapped in the loop, Jess hurriedly drives away, but she crashes into a truck and Tommy is killed and the earlier double (who Jess killed) is seen dead at the scene. In the aftermath, the real Jess stands watching the accident scene. A taxi driver approaches her and she accepts a ride to the harbour. After promising to return, she joins the others on Greg's boat, starting the loop again.  Cast   Production  The film, a British-Australian co-production, was written and directed by Christopher Smith. The UK Film Council awarded ¬£1.6 million ($2.8 million) of public money from the National Lottery fund towards the development, production and distribution of the film. Smith was inspired by Dead of Night and Memento. He wanted to make a circular film that explored d√©j√† vu that avoided using the same elements as Jacob's Ladder. The film was shot on sets and on location in Queensland, Australia; the sets include the exterior of a cruise liner, which Smith insisted on constructing as he believed it was important that they avoid shooting everything with green screens. The film is based in part on the story of Sisyphus, a figure in Greek mythology.  Release  The film premiered in the UK at the London FrightFest Film Festival on 27 August 2009. Triangle was theatrically released on 16 October 2009, in the UK; 30 December 2009 in Belgium; 21 January 2010 in the Netherlands. Triangle grossed $894,985 in its native UK and $1,303,598 total worldwide. It did not receive a theatrical release in the US. = Home media = Icon Home Entertainment distributed Triangle on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK, with a release date of 1 March 2010, whilst First Look Studios distributed the title on both DVD and Blu-ray with a release date of 2 February 2010.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports an approval rating of 80% based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 6.53/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"Triangle sails into some strange waters, but this intelligent, well-acted horror outing anchors its idiosyncrasies in a satisfyingly scary story.\\" Empire gave the film a 4/5 stars rating and called it a \\"satisfying mind-twister, with an unexpectedly poignant pay-off\\". Variety said that Triangle only makes some kind of sense on its own fantastic level. Time Out London reviewer Nigel Floyd praised Melissa George's \\"fearless, credible performance\\" that \\"grounds the madness in a moving emotional reality\\". The Guardian critic, Philip French compared it to a \\"M√∂bius strip\\" in which the viewer \\"wonders how Smith will keep things going\\" and added the viewer will \\"leave his picture suitably shaken\\". Fellow Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw wrote that Triangle is a \\"smart, interestingly constructed scary movie\\", complimenting Smith for \\"creating some real shivers\\". Entertainment.ie's Mike Sheridan was less impressed. Although he praised George's acting, he wrote that her performance \\"can't shield the fact that this still an exceptionally non-scary horror, that will have you scratching your head more than jumping out of your seat\\", ultimately rating it 2/5 stars. The Scotsman called it \\"a trickily plotted and slickly made effort that nevertheless can't quite make its premise fly in gripping enough fashion\\".

The program began in 1998 and started to accept records in 2008. As of 2017, NARA was working to overhaul the system in an effort called \\"ERA 2.0.\\"  History  Efforts by U.S. government archivists to preserve electronic records date to the 1960s but the task took on heightened importance toward the end of the 20th century, as the volume and variety of government-produced digital records expanded.Worsham, James. \\"How the National Archives Evolved Over 75 Years of Change and Challenges,\\" Prologue, Vol. 41, No. 2 (Summer 2009). According to Kenneth Thibodeau when he was the ERA program's director, the idea of an initiative to better manage electronic records took shape in the 1990s as NARA officials looked ahead to the expected end of the Bill Clinton administration in January 2001, when the White House would hand over staff email messages for preservation: \\"We estimated the transfer of something in the realm of forty million e-mail messages. No system in the agency could handle that volume. Even if we expanded existing systems a hundredfold, we still could not handle the simple workload of copying those files.\\" In 1998, NARA launched the ERA program, and an office was established in 2000. The agency released a draft request for proposals in August 2003, followed by a final version in 2004. A $308 million, six-year contract to build the system was awarded to Lockheed Martin in September 2005. In 2008, the ERA system began accepting records from four pilot agencies, and in January 2009 it began to take in George W. Bush administration records. Development of the system ended in 2011 and within a few years it was storing hundreds of terabytes of electronic records.  Functions  NARA has described ERA as a \\"system of systems\\" with four primary functions: accepting electronic records from government bodies, assigning metadata to document those records, preserving those records, and allowing access to those records. This adapts the traditional work of archival processing to digital records, a form of digital curation. As of 2012, federal agencies also used ERA to submit proposed record retention schedules, and NARA used the system to review and either approve or reject those schedules. Schedules are used to determine how long records should be retained by the U.S. government before they are destroyed, with only some records deemed worthy of permanent preservation. Only a small fraction of government records, 1% to 3%, are preserved in perpetuity by NARA.  ERA 2.0  In 2012, NARA decided the ERA system required \\"extensive modernization and refactoring,\\" which would come in a project called ERA 2.0. Among other things, the project would incorporate cloud computing technology and an Agile software approach. The new system will include a Digital Processing Environment to accept and process digital materials, and a Digital Object Repository to store materials. A pilot program began in 2015 and the production release was scheduled for 2018.

Smith previously represented the 4th Senate District, which is composed of Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Southgate and the north side of Detroit. From 2003 to 2008, Smith represented State House District 7, compromised of the northern tier of Detroit. Personal life Smith is the son of Third Judicial Circuit of Michigan of retired Chief Judge and former Michigan State Senator Virgil C. Smith. On May 6, 2009, Smith married Anistia Thomas. Smith filed for divorce in July 2009, citing a marital breakdown beyond repair. Thomas denied that there was a breakdown in the marriage and counter sued for an annulment. Smith later consented to his wife's request for the annulment, which Wayne County Circuit Judge Charlene Elder granted on Oct. 6, 2009. The couple have no children. Smith and Thomas consented to an intimate relationship after the annulment, prior to a May 2015 incident at Smith's home, where Smith accused Thomas of intruding at his property, which resulted in Smith shooting at Thomas' vehicle. Education Smith did his undergraduate studies at Michigan State University earning a degree in political science. He received his master's degree in public administration from Western Michigan University. Criminal and civil history =Minor in Possession of Alcohol= In 2000, Smith was arrested for minor in possession of alcohol, according to Michigan Secretary of State spokesman Fred Woodhams. =Impaired Driving= Smith's license was revoked in 2004 after being charged for operating while impaired February 2004 and operating while intoxicated in August of 2004. His license was reinstated in 2008. In 2010, Smith was pulled over by Detroit police for speeding. The officer detected a ‚Äústrong odor of intoxicants.‚Äù Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy recused herself from the case, citing a \\"potential conflict\\" involving Smith's father. The case was then sent to the Washtenaw County Prosecutors office who decided not to move forward with charges because, Smith's BAC ratio at the time of the stop was under the legal limit. =Malicious Destruction of Property= On May 10, 2015, Smith was charged with domestic violence, malicious destruction of property and felonious assault after an altercation between him and his ex-wife, Anistia Thomas at his home in the 18600 block of Wexford, on Detroit's east side. The charges of felonious assault and domestic violence were dismissed on August 29, 2020 citing insufficient evidence. On the morning of May 10, 2015 at approximately 1:00 a.m., Thomas arrived to Smith's home unannounced, after not being able to get in contact with Smith via phone that evening. Smith, who was inside the home was asleep in his bed with another woman. Thomas banged on Smith's bedroom window requesting him to come outside of the home. Smith was awaken by the pounding at the window and met Thomas at the side door in sweatpants and a t-shirt and Thomas forced her way inside of Smith's home. According to Thomas's first police report, Thomas alleged that Smith met her at the door naked with another woman. After Thomas was inside the home, she discovered another woman in Smith's bed. A fight followed, during which Smith was trying to refrain Thomas from attacking his guest. According to Thomas's police report Smith punched her in the face four to five times, which caused swelling and that Smith rammed Thomas' head into the floor and wall, which caused Thomas to fall into a TV. Thomas then alleged Smith put his arm into the back of her neck, preventing her from breathing. Thomas then left the home, and fell over railing causing her to hit her face on the concrete. According to Thomas's police report, when she got up, Smith was \\"holding a big gun in the air\\". Smith then fired several shots into Thomas's 2015 Mercedes Benz GLA250. Thomas ran into a nearby alley and fled into the nearby home of Smith's neighbor, ‚Äúwho allowed her to call 911 and clean her wounds.‚Äù The neighbor later tried to retrieve vehicle, but it was ‚Äúunable to start due to gunshot damage.\\" Evidence technicians later found three bullet holes in the vehicle's hood; two in the driver's side headlight; two in the driver's side front fender; and one each in the driver's side door, windshield, and rear driver's door pillar. Smith called it the stupidest thing he had done in his life. On May 12, 2015, Thomas requested a personal protection order (PPO) against Smith, which was authorized. In the application, Smith alleged two additional domestic violence incidents involving Smith: one in 2007, the other in 2008, but cited in the request she did not call authorities for either alleged incident. In March 2016, Prosecutors agreed to a plea deal with Smith, dismissing two felonies, including a count of possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony, which carries a mandatory two-year prison sentence, and the felonious assault. The misdemeanor count of domestic violence was dismissed also. Smith plead guilty to a felony count of malicious destruction of personal property of $20,000 or more. Part of the agreement called for Smith to resign from his job as a legislator and too not hold public office during the five years of his probation. On March 14, 2016, Smith was sentenced to 10 months in jail with no early release. He was also sentenced to five years of probation, ordered to stay away from alcohol, comply with mental health treatment and to have no contact with his ex-wife. During sentencing, Wayne County Circuit Judge Lawrence Talon ruled that he did not have the authority to impose Smith's resignation as a condition of sentence and removed it from the plea agreement. Talon stated on the record that Smith could be expelled, voted out of office or resign, but requiring him to step down violated the state constitution. Prosecutor Worthy asked Judge Talon to vacate the plea deal, in response to the elimination of the resignation requirement. Judge Talon disagreed and argued that vacating the plea agreement would not serve in \\"the interests of justice and accepted the modified plea.\\" Talon's ruling allowed Smith to receive his $71,685 annual salary plus benefits while serving time in the County jail. On March 31, 2016, Smith submitted a letter of resignation to the Michigan Senate, effective April 12, 2016. Smith was released from jail in December 2016. As a result of Talon's ruling, Smith decided to run for the Detroit City Council, causing Prosecutor Worthy to appeal the ruling in an attempt to keep Smith off the ballot. In August 2017, the Michigan appeals court upheld Judge Talon's ruling in a 2-1 decision. Judges Deborah Servitto and Michael Kelly said it would be ‚Äúcoercion‚Äù to allow prosecutors to try to negotiate a politician's future as part of a plea deal. In dissent, Judge Michael Riordan said the plea deal should have been set aside at the prosecutor's request, after Judge Talon stripped some key conditions. Prosecutor Worthy appealed the ruling to the Michigan Supreme Court, asking them to decide the issue of whether it's a violation of the separation of powers for a judge to essentially sign off on an agreement that prohibits a person from running for office. On January 11, 2018, the Supreme Court heard arguments regarding Smith's eligibility to run for political office. The Supreme Court ruled in June 2018, the prosecutor did not have the authority to include terms inside the plea agreement that Smith could not hold public office or to force his resignation because it would \\"offend public policy.\\" Political career =2002 House Election= Smith won the Democratic primary in 2002 against former state senator Henry Stallings II. =2010 Senate election= In 2010 Smith defeated former House Appropriations Committee Chair George Cushingberry in the August Primary to fill the Michigan Senate seat formerly held by Samuel \\"Buzz\\" Thomas, who left due to term limits. =2014 Senate election= Smith was re-elected in 2014 to a second four-year term after defeating former state Rep. Rashida Tlaib in the Democratic Primary. Smith resigned from the state Senate in April 2016 after his guilty plea for shooting at his ex-wife's Mercedes-Benz in May 2015. =2017 Detroit City Council election= The Detroit City Clerk's office issued petitions for Smith to run for City Council, District 2 on April 7, 2017. Smith finished second in the August Primary, where he faced Roy McCalister Jr. on the General Election ballot. Smith went on to lose the General Election to McCalister.

Early life and education Lefever was born in York, Pennsylvania on November 12, 1919. He grew up in a pacifist tradition and was ordained as a minister in the Church of the Brethren. He attended Elizabethtown College, graduating in 1942. He attended Yale Divinity School, where he was awarded a degree in 1945, later receiving a doctoral degree in Christian ethics from the school, in 1956.Bernstein, Adam. \\"Ernest W.

While there, a visit to the remains of the Bergen- Belsen concentration camp turned him into a self-described \\"humane realist\\", with his sight of \\"scattered rib bones in the red clay\\" convincing him of the tangibility of evil. He took a bone from the camp which he would show at lectures to explain his transformation. Professionally, Lefever served as a foreign affairs consultant to Hubert H. Humphrey when he was in the United States Senate, in a similar role with the National Council of Churches and as a senior researcher at the Brookings Institution. In 1976, Lefever established the Ethics and Public Policy Center to apply \\"the Judeo-Christian moral tradition to critical issues of public policy\\" by defending \\"the great Western ethical imperatives‚Äîrespect for the inherent dignity of the human person, individual freedom and responsibility, justice, the rule of law, and limited government.\\"About, Ethics and Public Policy Center.

State Department nomination President Ronald Reagan nominated Lefever for a post as Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs in the Department of State. The 1981 nomination was cited by The Washington Post as an effort to appeal to \\"ultraconservatives\\" upset that Secretary of State Alexander Haig had failed to appoint conservative \\"hardliners\\" to his policy team. Lefever testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the U.S. should not act to \\"promote human rights in other sovereign states\\".

When a voltage is applied to these probes, electrons are emitted from the tips through a process known as field electron emission. When a body is subjected to ion milling in vacuum, we do not get to know about the geometry of the surface of the body. So to study it we will keep the field emission probes which will emit electrons as soon as a voltage is applied across it. This in turn will cause emission of secondary electrons from the surface of the body that is subjected to ion milling, by collecting these secondary emitted electrons we get a clear image of the surface of the ion milled body. This is the technique that is used in the or scanning electron microscope(SEM). There exist various well defined techniques for preparing field emission probes. Ideally, a field emission probe should be extremely sharp, possibly terminating in a single atom, in order to resolve details at the atomic level; it should have a small aspect ratio to reduce mechanical vibration while scanning, have a stable atomic configuration at its apex to yield reliable and reproducible images, and be clean to ensure a stable tunnel junction, since the presence of contaminants like oxides or etching by products could alter its metallic behavior. Our experimental setup helps us obtain tips with an apex radius of a few nanometres.

Summary Teeing off on the first hole (Atari ST). Leader Board, the first game in the series, was released in 1986 and included four different water-based courses. It was well received, being rated as 97% overall by Zzap 64 magazine and being prized with their \\"Gold Award\\". It was also highly rated by other magazines, with Your Sinclair rating it 9 out of 10, Sinclair User giving it five stars, and Crash rating it 80%. Leaderboard Tournament, released the same year, was a series of expansion disks each containing four new courses. The second game in the series was Leader Board: Executive Edition, which was released in 1987 and contained new landscape and course features, such as trees and bunkers. Despite these additions, the game was less well received than its predecessor, being given an overall rating of 72% by Zzap 64 magazine. World Class Leader Board was the last game in the series and included four courses; Cypress Creek, Doral Country Club, St Andrews, and the fictional Gauntlet Country Club. Three course expansion disks were later released. Special features in this final version included a course overview (overhead view), the punch shot, a printable score card, the use of RealSound, and a course editor which allowed changes to be made to the existing courses. It was considered a vast improvement on Executive, being given a 94% overall rating by Zzap 64 magazine, and 9 out of 10 by Your Sinclair. Reception Leader Board was Access' third best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987. Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"Leader Board has the most realistic putting feel of any golf game I've ever tried. When the ball finally makes it into the cup, the sound of that success is also amazingly realistic.\\" Compute!'s Gazette praised the Commodore 64 version's realism and amazing (\\"there is no other word for it\\") graphics. While noting Leader Boards use of only water hazards, and no difference in color between the fairway and green, the magazine concluded that it \\"is fun, a lot of fun, and as addicting as the real game\\". Computer Gaming World stated that Leader Board for the Amiga improved on the Commodore 64 version, and praised the graphics, but preferred the also- outstanding Mean 18. Info gave the Amiga version four stars out of five, liking the gameplay and \\"nicely done graphics\\" but noting the absence of a practice green or course construction. The magazine concluded, \\"It's tough to choose between this and Mean 18\\". Antic wrote that the Atari ST version \\"will keep you happy for hours\\", praising its graphics. While noting deviations from the rules of golf, the reviewer concluded recommending Leader Board \\"as an entertaining game for anyone, regardless of skill and knowledge of golf\\".

Adult beetles feed on pollen and nectar, but the larvae feed on animal fibres and can be damaging pests to carpets, fabrics and museum specimens. Description Larva with millimeter scale The adult common carpet beetle varies from about in length. The antennae have eleven segments, three of which form a club, and the eyes are notched at the front. The head is black but is largely concealed under the prothorax, which is also black, liberally speckled with white scales apart from a band in the centre. The elytra (wing cases) are black with orange or reddish scales near the midline and variable but symmetric patches of white scales elsewhere. As the beetle gets older, the scales tend to get rubbed off so the beetle changes in appearance. The small white eggs are laid in batches of 30 to 60 and have projections which help them to adhere to carpet fibres. The larvae are brown and moult five times before pupating; the final instar larva is hairy and larger than the adult beetle. Pupation takes place in the last larval skin. Distribution The common carpet beetle originated in the Palaearctic region, but has been widely introduced elsewhere, now being present in most parts of the world. However, it is more common in temperate parts of the northern hemisphere and less common in the tropics and humid regions. Life cycle Adult beetles feed on pollen and nectar, usually selecting white or whitish flowers such as buckwheat, wild aster, daisy, Spiraea and Ceanothus. This diet encourages mating and egg-laying, and the females seek out suitable locations with animal hairs or fibres for ovipositing; these include bird and animal nests, bee hives and the skins of dead animals, as well as indoor sites such as carpets, upholstery, fabrics or preserved animal material. The eggs hatch in two to three weeks, and the larvae chew at whatever animal fibres they find in their environment. After about two months the larvae pupate and the adult insects emerge about a month later and, if indoors, make their way into the open air. Control wasp in an insect collection When the eggs are laid on carpets and household fabrics, the larvae feed on the animal fibres and make holes in the materials. Exhibits in museums may be eaten away, leaving a powdering of fine dust round dried insects in collections; herbarium specimens may also be consumed. Human skin that comes into contact with the discarded larval skins may develop dermatitis. Good hygiene and regular vacuuming may prevent infestations from happening. Small items can be placed in airtight containers to keep the beetles out, and both heat and cold treatments are effective against the larvae and eggs. In enclosed spaces, mothballs can be placed as a repellent. Chemical treatments are possible but may not reach all the recesses where the insects lurk, and fumigation may be necessary in extreme cases.

The theatrical genre of aqua drama that was popular in 19th century France, England, and the United States involved flooding the arenas of circuses for recreations of major naval conflicts and similar aquatic events; some venues participated to such a great extent in this once-popular form as to install permanent water-tanks on stage.Harrison, p. 17 Water-based spectacles, especially those portraying great naval battles, had been popular in Roman times, when they were known as naumachia, and the custom was resurrected at various times during the Middle Ages.  Beginning  At the start of the 19th century, the already established Sadler's Wells Theatre came under the management of Charles Dibdin, Jr., a man who had big plans for the theatre's future. In 1804, he installed a large 90x24x3ft water tank that covered the entire stage.Jane Austin's World The water used to fill the tank was pumped in from the New River, which was adjacent to the theatre, by an Archimedes wheel.Arundell p. 72 This process took twelve men twelve hours: four men would work in four hour shifts and then rotate until the entire tank was full. Even though the tanks were drained and refilled every three weeks they would become filthy. The water would become dirty not only from the shows, but the actors would bathe in the tank, along with rowdy audience members jumping in to see if the water was real.Lewis The Aquatic Drama was popular in the early 19th century, and with Sadler's Wells on the outskirts of London, the audiences, especially in the pit were unruly, loud, and most likely drunk.Goldfarb and Edwin 397 The large water tank that these disruptive audience members would jump into was not the only tank in the theatre, Dibdin Jr. had a second 5x5x5 ft tank above the theatre that was used to simulate waterfalls. 19th century performances The first show Dibdin, Jr. and his crew put on was The Siege of Gibralter. It opened in 1804, and it was a play that depicted the naval battle between the English Navy and the Spanish Armada. A playbill from this performance describes the battle in the show: \\"the conflagration of the town in various places, the defense of the garrison, and attack by the floating batteries, [which] is so faithfully and naturally represented, that when the floating batteries take fire, some blowing up with a dreadful explosion, and others, after burning to the water‚Äôs edge, sink to the bottom; while the gallant Sir Roger Curtis appears in his boat to save the drowning Spaniards, the British tars for that purpose plunging into the water, the effect is such as to produce an unprecedented climax of astonishment and applause.\\"Nicoll p. 43 There were 177 ships on the liquid stage, all equipped with live guns and ready for battle. Over a hundred real scale sized naval ships would not have been able to fit in Sadler's Wells tanks, so Dibdin hired men who worked at the Woolwich Dockyards to build him smaller ships built at a one-inch per foot scale, with exact detailed imitation down to the rigging. Children were cast as some of the Spanish naval officers manning the tiny ships, and were seen ‚Äúdrowning‚Äù after the Spanish had been defeated. The climactic battle of the show was when the English and Spanish went head on, full force, with guns blazing, and the audience members saw incredible spectacle as the English triumphantly destroyed the Spanish Armada.Arundell p. 74 In 1823 Sadler's Wells presented the aqua drama entitled The Island or Christian and His Comrades which dramatized the main events of the Mutiny on board HMS Bounty.Kirk, p. 55 In order to alleviate a twenty-minute delay between a dry land scene and an aquatic scene, the stage was made to ascend to near the roof of the theatre, in full view of the audience.Ledger, p. f  The Fall  Eventually the aqua drama slash began to ripple then calm as audience members were no longer pleased with what was being performed at Sadler's Wells. This could have been due to the fact that Dibdin, Jr. tried to reuse many of his 177 ships from the Siege of Gibraltar, and they were no longer new and exciting to the audiences, but also the Napoleonic wars could have contributed. According to Dan Cuickshank at BBC News, the Napoleonic wars were raging on during the early 1800s and England dipped its toes in the war waters in 1793 with the new Revolutionary France. After a decade of fighting the two countries finally signed at the Treaty of Amiens, which only lasted a month until in May 1803 war broke out between the two countries again.Cuickshank The initial declaration of war could have sparked a rise in nationalism with in England, being a contributing factor into the Dibden, Jr. and his aquatic drama's success. Britain was known for having a large and powerful navy, and they didn't mind flexing their muscles as they asserted themselves as the most powerful navy in Europe at the 1815 after their victory at Waterloo. The citizens of England would have known how powerful their countries navy was. Seeing shows, such as the ones being put at Sadler's Wells, reminded the English people of how strong their military was, making them feel proud and safe initially. Yet, after a few years into the war the citizens began to realize the horrors of war. According to Mather, they were exposed not only to the death of friends and family along with the fear of invasion, but also the raising of taxes to fund the military.Mather A staggering 11.6 million, which is around 570 million pounds in today's market, was spent on forts alone, most of which were protecting dock yards. The British people became fed up with war, especially naval combat and eventually the tanks were taken out of the theatre. Removal of the tanks due to lack of popularity reflects the English nation's view of war.  Legacy  Even though the tanks were removed in 1824, aqua drama was a part of a long lasting theatre's history. The legacy left behind of aquatic theatre is only a few pages in books and websites, and a painting or two, but Sadler's Wells legacy has been alive and well since Richard Sadler first opened his music house in 1683.Crompton Since then the theatre has seen many triumphs and tragedies. After Charles Dibdin, Jr. resigned there was a false fire alarm during one of the shows which lead to 18 people being stampeded to death. In 1843 the theater was once again successful, as the actor manager Samuel Philips put on Shakespeare's plays. Sadly, in 1915 the doors to Sadler's Wells were closed. Lilian Baylis, who wanted everyone in London to have the privilege to see the mesmerizing art of theatre, raised the money to reopen Sadler's Wells. The Sadler's Wells legacy continued as it was once again able to share theatre's magic with the people of northern London in 1931. After many years of putting on progressive theatre that entertained northern London, the play aspect of Sadler's Wells eventually faded out, opera and dance became prominent. Around 1945 Sadler's Wells started to become a strictly dance performance hall. The theatre legacy was replaced over the next half century as the once music hall become an outstanding, well respected dance hall. Sadler's Wells still stands today, not in the same building, but with the murky water of Charles Dibdin, Jr.‚Äôs aquatic theatre running in its historic veins.  New York  New York City's Lafayette Circus (1826-1829) boasted equipment for both equestrian, or \\"Hippodrama\\", and aquatic dramas.Banham, p. 1136 On July 4, 1840, The Bowery Theatre in New York City produced The Pirates Signal.

The law states that insurance companies must provide up to $50,000, annually, on behavioral therapy, up to the age of 16. The law provides coverage for various treatments, including Applied Behavior Analysis, which was previously denied as \\"experimental\\". Ryan's Law also prohibits insurers from refusing other medical care to children because of their autism.Mom wins fight for autism insurance; by Justine Redman; CNN; April 1, 2008 The law does not apply to people who (or companies which) are self- insured. The bill was authored by Lorri Unumb, who was at the time a law professor at the Charleston School of Law, and the mother of a four-year-old autistic boy, after whom the law is named. Passage of the legislation took nearly two years, and was the result of an intense grassroots campaign which was orchestrated by Unumb and supported by hundreds of families in South Carolina. Lacking funds to hire a lobbyist, Unumb and the supporters, known as the Ryan‚Äôs Law Grassroots Gang, personally lobbied South Carolina legislators through visits and letter-writing campaigns. The bill was passed in May 2007, and the law went into effect in July 2008. Terminology related to autism The term \\"autism\\" is used in different ways. It can be used to refer to autistic disorder, or it can be used to refer to any or all of the three conditions on the autism spectrum, autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS. Under the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), the three conditions on the autism spectrum belong to a broader class known as Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), which also includes Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder. Passage of the bill =Initial filing= The bill was written by Unumb and pre-filed in the South Carolina legislature in late 2005. Rep. Nathan Ballentine (R-Irmo) was the primary sponsor in the South Carolina House of Representatives, and Rep. Ray Cleary (R-Murrell's Inlet) was the primary sponsor in the South Carolina Senate. The companion House and Senate bills were first considered by the South Carolina legislature during the 2006 session. The Senate bill (S.958) was assigned to the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee, where it received strong support from the committee's chairman, Senator David Thomas (R-Greenville). Thomas created a subcommittee, which held a public hearing on the bill on January 12, 2006; this hearing was attended by hundreds of supporters. Witnesses in support of the bill included Unumb, Dr. Gina Green, Dr. Jane Charles, Dr. Shelley Holstrum, Dr. Scott Edwards, and Walt Jenner, among others.Adventures in Autism; by John Gilmore; September 1, 2008 =Medicaid waiver= In the South Carolina House of Representatives, the bill (H.4351) was assigned to the House Labor, Commerce and Industry Committee (LCI), chaired by Rep. Harry Cato. During public hearings before the Insurance Subcommittee of LCI, the House bill was amended considerably as part of a deal struck by the insurance industry and some legislators. The insurance language was removed from the bill, and was replaced by language directing the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs to set up a government program to benefit children with autism. As amended, the bill passed in 2006. Shortly thereafter, South Carolina applied to the federal government for a Medicaid waiver, in order to establish the Pervasive Developmental Disorders waiver program. Through this program, parents of autistic children aged 3 through 11 could apply for funding to cover an Applied Behavior Analysis therapy program for their child. Each child could receive up to $50,000 in funding, annually, for up to 3 years. In 2007, approximately one hundred children in South Carolina began receiving therapy services under the new program, and by 2009, over four hundred children were receiving services. =Return to legislature= In 2007, the Ryan's Law Grassroots Gang, led by Unumb, Lisa Rollins, and Marcella Ridley, returned to the South Carolina legislature to make another attempt to pass the insurance legislation. This time, the House bill (H.3468) was sponsored by Rep. Skipper Perry (R-Aiken), with continued support from Nathan Ballentine, lead sponsor in 2006. The Senate bill (S.20) was sponsored by Sen. Dick Elliott (D-Myrtle Beach), with continued support from the 2006 lead sponsor, Sen. Ray Cleary. Additional hearings were held on the companion bills during the 2007 session, and numerous legislators co-sponsored the bills. Sen. Joel Lourie (D-Columbia) played an instrumental role in arranging negotiations between those in favor of the bill and those representing the insurance companies, and in furthering discussions during intense deadline pressure. On May 25, 2007, the General Assembly passed the Senate bill. =Veto and override= In a turn of events, South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford vetoed the bill on June 6, 2007, the penultimate night of the 2007 legislative session.Sanford's veto The next morning‚Äîthe last day of the legislative session‚Äîthe Ryan's Law Grassroots Gang showed up in force at the South Carolina State House to plead with the legislators to put their bill on the day's agenda, and to override the governor's veto. On June 7, 2007, the South Carolina Senate overrode the governor's veto on a voice vote, and the South Carolina House overrode the veto on a roll call vote. Both chambers' override votes were unanimous, creating a dramatic and emotional ending. Message that Unumb sent to the Ryan‚Äôs Law Grassroots Gang on June 7, 2007 In April 2008, CNN profiled the passage of Ryan's Law. Summary of the law Ryan's Law applies to people with a condition on the autism spectrum: either autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, or PDD-NOS. It mandates that insurance companies provide up to $50,000 a year of coverage for behavioral therapy until the age of 16. The child must be diagnosed at age eight or before, and the $50,000 maximum on behavioral therapy is to be adjusted every year on January 1 based on the Consumer Price Index.South Carolina Code; South Carolina Code It further prohibits insurance companies from refusing autistic children other medical treatment or attention on the basis of their condition. Autism cannot be used as a basis for refusing care for other medically reasonable or necessary treatment or procedures. The bill does not cover individuals who are insured through employers that have self-funded plans. Such plans are not subject to state regulation and are governed by federal ERISA law. In 2009, federal legislation was introduced in both chambers of the United States Congress to require self-funded plans to offer autism benefits.

Mud log in process, a common way to study the lithology when drilling wells. Boring is used for various applications in geology, agriculture, hydrology, civil engineering, and mineral exploration. Today, most earth drilling serves one of the following purposes: * return samples of the soil and/or rock through which the drill passes * access rocks from which material can be extracted * access rocks which can then be measured * provide access to rock for purposes of providing engineering support Unlike drilling in other materials where the aim is to create a hole for some purpose, often the case of drilling or coring is to get an understanding of the ground/lithology. This may be done for prospecting to identify and quantify an ore body for mining, or to determining the type of foundations needed for a building or raised structure, or for underground structures, including tunnels and deep basements where an understanding of the ground is vital to determining how to excavate and the support philosophy. Drilling is also used in vertical and inclined shaft construction. History Borehole drilling has a long history. Han dynasty China (202 BC ‚Äì 220 AD) used deep borehole drilling for mining and other projects. Chinese borehole sites could reach as deep as 600 m (2000 ft).* Loewe, Michael. (1968). Everyday Life in Early Imperial China during the Han Period 202 BC‚ÄìAD 220. London: B.T. Batsford Ltd.; New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, p. 194. Methods When drilling in stone, one must pay particular attention to the type of material. There are three different classifications of drill bits used for drilling into stone: soft, medium, and hard. Soft formation rock bits are used in unconsolidated sands, clays, and soft limestones, etc. Medium formation bits are used in dolomites, limestones, and shale, while hard formation bits are used in hard shale, mudstones, granite, limestones and other hard and/or abrasive formations. Soft ground drilling can be undertaken using a rotary auger or wash boring techniques, while rock drilling often use methods such as NMLC which allow for recovery of a core of material which can be examined to determine the strength, degree of weathering, understanding of any how intact the rock is (RQD) and identify any discontinuities or other planes of weakness. Testing of the material in boreholes is also possible. In soft ground the standard penetration test can be used to determine the strength of the material. In rock in-situ stress testing using hydrofracturing or overcoring, Acoustic Televiewer can be used to map discontinuities to determine their orientation. It is also possible once a borehole is complete to measure the permeability. Samples of water and material are also taken for examination and lab testing.  Superdeep Borehole  In 1961 the United States began Project Mohole, an ambitious attempt to drill through the Earth's crust into the Mohoroviƒçiƒá discontinuity. The project was discontinued due to high cost. The Kola Superdeep Borehole was a similar project of the USSR in the 1970s and early 1980s the USSR attempted to drill a hole through the crust, to sample the Mohorovicic Discontinuity. The deepest hole ever drilled failed not because of lack of money or time, but because of rock physics at depth. At approximately 12,000 metres depth, rock begins to act more like a plastic solid than a rigid solid. Rock temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius, required that the drilling fluid be refrigerated before being sent to the cutting face of the drill. As the drill bits burnt out and were removed for replacement, the hole simply flowed closed, and the rock had to be re- drilled. The hole was scrapped. Further attempts are planned by American consortia and further Russian attempts in Finland.  Ice boring  Ice cores are drilled by hollow bits, in much the same way that sediment cores are drilled. When all that is needed is the hole, hot water drill technology may be used to melt holes in ice or snow for both Arctic and Antarctic research purposes. Equipment for such a method is also lightweight when drilling deep holes, compared to traditional drilling equipment. Hot water drilling has been used successfully in the IceCube Neutrino Detector and Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array projects to drill as deep as 2,450 meters.

The park is home to many bike trails, dog parks, and Sunnybrook Stables.http://www.sunnybrookstables.ca/home.html History Sunnybrook was once a 175 acre farm property with horse stables, known as Sunnybrook Farm, situated in the Town of Leaside. It was owned by Joseph and Alice Kilgour and turned over to the City of Toronto in 1928. Kilgour was President of the Canada Paper Company and acquired the farm in 1890s.http://www1.toronto.ca/City%20Of%20Toronto/Toronto%20Water/Files/pdf/D/drncw- esr-appendix-3-2-final-char-don-waterfront-trunk-sewer-cso-umca-dec-2011.pdf In 1933 Kilgour Memorial Gates at Bayview Avenue and Blythwood Road (since demolished) as well as a plaque at Wilket Creek Park were added to commemorate the Kilgour family's legacy and presence in the area.  Stables  Sunnybrook Stables is a horseback riding facility that has been open to the public since 1978. The stables house roughly thirty horses, accompanied by two arenas: a 12,000 square-foot indoor arena built in 1982 for year-round practice, as well as an outdoor arena that also serves as a paddock. Just behind the indoor arena are three other paddocks, also used for the horses to roam when they're not in their stalls. = Stable Fire = On the morning of May 21, 2018, Sunnybrook Stables caught on fire killing 16 of the 29 horses in the stable. It is suspected that the fire was caused by fireworks. Cricket Sunnybrook hosted a first-class cricket fixture in 2004. The Canada national cricket team used the ground for their ICC Intercontinental Cup match against Bermuda, which ended in a draw with Canada requiring only one further wicket to win. The ground also hosted six matches during the 2001 ICC Trophy.

The museum was previously known as the Trompmuseum, after Brielle-born Maarten Tromp who defeated the Spanish fleet in the Eighty Years' War. History The museum was founded in 1912 by the government of Den Briel. In 1958 a charitable organization supporting the museum was created. In 1998 the museum received a nationally recognized certification of quality. The museum has twice suffered from theft in recent history. In 2003 nine gold coins were stolen and in 2009 thieves took an 18th-century clay pipe from the exhibition. Collection The museum is organized largely chronologically and in part thematically. At ground level a largely archaeological exhibition is on display. This exhibition was thoroughly reorganized and expanded in 2007, adding most prominently some recently discovered late medieval wax tablets. Apart from prehistorical, Roman and medieval Brielle the museum also presents Brielle during the Eighty Years' War and the Second World War. The museum is located inside Brielle's former weigh house and local prison, built in 1623. With old prison cells on display, the building itself is considered part of the collection.

They recorded several singles before splitting up in 1982, when lead singer Tony Perfect left to join Angelic Upstarts. Reforming in 2000, they have recorded and released several albums. Career Long Tall Shorty were one of the earliest mod revival bands, formed in August 1978 from the ashes of the punk rock band Ben E Dorm & The Tourists. Initially called The Indicators, the line-up was: Jimmy Grant (bass), Mark Reynolds (drums) and Tony Perfect (guitar/vocals). After Keith Mono joined in October 1978, The Indicators were offered a support slot to Sham 69 at the Electric Ballroom in Camden. After Sham 69's singer Jimmy Pursey saw Long Tall Shorty for the first time, he invited them to the Polydor Records Studio to record some demos. The tracks \\"1970's Boy\\", \\"Shake\\" and \\"New Generation\\" were recorded live at this first session in February 1979. \\"1970's Boy\\" was chosen as the first single. Pursey decided they should change the band's name to Long Tall Shorty, after a song by The Kinks, written by Don Covay and first recorded by Tommy Tucker. Over the next few months, Long Tall Shorty performed at The Wellington, and played slots with Angelic Upstarts, until June 1979 when they played on the pavement in Carnaby Street. This led to a review in the mod fanzine Maximum Speed, and offers of support slots from Back To Zero and The Teenbeats. They added a second guitarist, Stewart England. \\"By Your love\\" was recorded in August 1979 and eventually chosen as the A side of the single. \\"Falling For you\\", \\"Please Can You Tell Me\\" and \\"Can't Stop moving\\" were recorded at Shepperton Studios, Surrey in September 1979. The idea was to have a second single ready for release, but Warner Bros. Records withdrew \\"By Your love\\" a few days after its release. In February 1980, following their first headline slot at The Marquee, the original band split up. They had been offered the support slot on The Chords' UK tour, but after the first night in Middlesbrough, they pulled out. Mark Reynolds and Jimmy Grant left and the new line-up was Keith Mono (vocals), Stewart England (guitar), Tony Perfect (bass) and Mike Morrison (drums). During three days of summer 1980, \\"That's What I Want\\", \\"If I Was You\\", \\"I Do\\" and \\"All By Myself\\" were recorded as demos for CBS Records. Another mod fanzine, D.R.C., issued two songs on a flexi disc after the CBS negotiations broke down. The other songs surfaced on the LP The Beat Generation And The Angry Young Men. In December 1980, Mike left the band, followed by Keith the following day. Derwent joined on drums later that month. They had a monthly residency at The Marquee Club. John Kiely joined on bass and Tony Perfect switched back to guitar and vocals. \\"Win Or Lose\\"/\\"Ain't Done wrong\\" were recorded in Luton and released on Ramkup. In August 1981, they played at the Reading Festival, accompanied by Eddie Piller, who later wrote a review in his fanzine Extraordinary Sensations of the riot that took place during the brief time they were on stage. There was another riot in Chatham and Long Tall Shorty got banned from The Marquee Club, John left the band mid- gig and Stewart left to join the Foreign Legion. Derwent Jaconelli was on drums and Mark, the roadie, joined on bass in November 1981 but two months later, Tony Perfect left, changed his name to Tony Feedback and joined Angelic Upstarts. The final Long Tall Shorty gig was at the 100 Club on 2 February 1982. 1983 Long Tall Shorty was reborn, Ian Jones on Bass and Derwent Jaconelli on Drums Tony Perfect guitar and lead vocals. 6 months later Steve Moran joined on rhythm guitar. 1984 was the release of On The Streets Again a 3 track single on vinyl. Both Ian and Derwent had a brief time playing with Angelic Upstarts and released Stepping Stone with Steve Moran. Ian and Tony went on to form Joe Public. After the 1997 release of the 1970's Boy compilation on Captain Mod Records, Long Tall Shorty re-formed in 1999 for the Mods May Day in London. Ian had already joined Ian Page as his bass player and went on to form Ian Page And The Affair. Completely Perfect, an almost complete overview of the band's early career containing all of the tracks from the previous 1970's Boy compilation along with 11 additional tracks with Ian Jones playing bass, was released by Detour Records that same year. 2002 Tony and brother Mike on drums plus Ian Jones and Brian Hayes from The Angelic Upstarts released SHINE ON ME on Countdown Records. Tony and Ian were joined by Brian and Dave Blackman from The TeenBeats on drums releasing the album A Bird in the Hand on Acid Jazz/Countdown Records in 2002. This Town was released on a compilation CD. 2005 After another line-up change a 3-track rhythm and blues CD was released on Biff Bang Pow records. No Good Woman, Call Me, A Girl Like You, Ian Jones left the band and stayed working Ian Page and The Affair After yet another line-up change the band then recorded a pure rhythm and blues album, No Good Women, in 2005 for Biff Bang Pow records. Several line-up changes later, Long Tall Shorty now includes: Tony Perfect (guitar/vocals), John Woodward (bass/backing vocals) and Jim Piddington (drums). They have not reverted to the mod/pop/punk of their early days, and have a new style that they call Giffer Punk. During 2009‚Äì2010, the band have toured extensively in Europe and are contracted to record for Time For Action Records in Germany. In September 2009, they release their first new LP in 4 years, \\"The Sound Of Giffer City\\" which was followed by \\"Kick Out The Shams\\", both on Time For Action, in June 2010. They have also released a \\"download\\" single, Police Oppression in May 2010. A further boost to the band came along in 2010 when the giant Universal Music Group, released a compilation LP called Mod Mania which featured the band's 1984 single, On The Streets Again. This LP reached No. 5 in the national UK Compilation LP Chart and features artists like Paul Weller, The Who and The Small Faces among others. Shorty have been having a bit of a hiatus in 2012, re-charging their batteries and allowing them time to develop other projects. Tony has been gigging and recording with Tim V's Sham 69 and If featuring Rick Butler from the Jam. John has been working with Garry Bushell and recording the debut Skanads ep \\"Skinhead Lullabies\\" to be released in September. Meanwhile, the boys haven't rested to long on their LTS laurels and are writing and recording a new album as yet untitled with a new musical direction. As Tony said recently in an online interview \\"we've been doing some of the songs for 30 years and I'm bored with them, in fact I'm bored with the ones we released only two albums ago - the only songs I'm not bored with are the ones we haven't written yet!\\" Discography *\\"By Your Love\\" / \\"1970's Boy\\" (Single) WEA, 1979 *\\"Win Or Lose\\" (Single) Ramkup, 1981 *\\"On The Streets Again\\" (Single) Diamond Records 1984 *1970's Boy (Album) Captain Mod 1997 *\\"Shine On Me\\" (Single) Acid Jazz 2001 *A Bird in the Hand (Album) Acid Jazz, 2002 *Completely Perfect (Album) Detour, 2002 *No Good Women (Album) Biff Bang Pow, 2005 *The Sounds Of Giffer City (Album) Time For Action Records 2009 *\\"Police Oppression\\" (Download Single) May 2010 *Kick Out The Shams (Album) ‚Äì Time For Action Records, June 2010 Compilations *Soul: The Mod Revival Generation ‚Äì Time For Action ‚Äì Music from the TV Series *Shake ‚Äì Biff Bang Pow *100% British Mod ‚Äì Cleopatra ‚Äì 28 April 1998 *On Target ‚Äì Music Club ‚Äì 6 Oct 1997 *Mod Mania LP ‚Äì Universal Music 2010 References * Mod: Clean Living Under Very Difficult Circumstances: a Very British Phenomenon ‚Äì Omnibus Press ‚Äì 12/1/2000 ‚Äì External links    Category:English new wave musical groups Category:English pop punk groups Category:Musical groups established in 1978 Category:British mod revival groups ","title":"Long Tall Shorty"},{"id":"23850773","title":"Filmfare Award for Best Art Director ‚Äì South"},{"id":"23850776","text":"David Charles Frederick (born April 9, 1961) is an appellate attorney in Washington, D.C., and is a partner with Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, P.L.L.C.

Frederick obtained a Doctor of Philosophy degree from Oxford University in 1987 as a Rhodes Scholar. In 1989, Frederick earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, where he also served as articles editor for the Texas Law Review. Professional career After law school, Frederick clerked for Judge Joseph T. Sneed of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and Justice Byron R.

Frederick has argued fifty cases in the Supreme Court of the United States, across a wide range of issues and industries. Frederick's victories often strengthen plaintiff and consumer interests. Throughout his career, he has demonstrated an ability to persuade conservative justices to take pro-consumer positions. =Pharmaceutical industry= In Wyeth v. Levine (6-3), Frederick helped to convince Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, Kennedy, Souter and Thomas that federal approval of labels that provide warnings about side effects of drugs do not bar lawsuits claiming inadequate warnings of a health risk in state law. In the case, Diana Levine sued Wyeth for failing to warn patients that the drug Phenergan could cause gangrene when administered using direct IV injection. The 2009 verdict, which overturned a ruling by the Vermont Supreme Court, was a victory for Levine and for victims who could continue bringing their cases to state courts.Totenberg, Nina, ‚ÄúSupreme Court Hears Case Involving Drug Labels, NPR Morning Edition, November 3, 2008. In 2010, in Merck & Co. v.

Merck asserted a statute of limitations defense, which would have ended before the shareholders had knowledge of all the requisite elements of fraud, but Frederick argued that the statute of limitations should not begin until the plaintiff has enough facts to survive a motion to dismiss.Jones, Ashby, \\"On Merck‚Äôs Interesting Supreme Court Argument,\\" Wall Street Journal, December 1, 2009 The next year, in Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano (9-0), Frederick argued that statistics involving adverse drug event reports could not negate materiality as a matter of law in a securities fraud suit if the number of adverse reports was not \\"statistically significant\\", upholding the decision of the Ninth Circuit.Block, Melissa,‚Äù Supreme Court Rebuffs Big Pharma in Zicam Suit, NPR All Things Considered, March 22, 2011.

Dow AgroSciences LLC, Frederick represented a group of peanut farmers from Texas whose crops had burned after the application of an herbicide produced by respondent Dow AgroSciences. The court held in 2005 that the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act‚Äôs express preemption provision does not preclude a range of claims that farmers might bring against manufacturers of agricultural pesticides and insecticides. In 2008, Altria Group, Inc. v. Good examined whether state-law fraud claims against cigarette makers for allegedly false statements made about light cigarettes are preempted under the federal statute that concerns tobacco labeling. In a 5-4 decision, the court held that state-law claims sounding in fraud against tobacco companies are not preempted by the express preemption provision of the federal labeling statute.Totenberg, Nina, ‚ÄúHigh Court OKs Cigarette Lawsuits, NPR All Things Considered, December 15, 2008.

In August she took part in Operation Mincemeat, which involved mine-laying in the Gulf of Genoa while disguised as the French destroyer L√©opard. From October 1941 to February 1942, Manxman was returned to the Home Fleet and took part in a number of mine-laying operations in the North Sea and the English Channel. In March, she joined the Eastern Fleet at Kilindini in the Indian Ocean. After escort and patrol duties, on 8 October she participated in the assault and capture of the island of Nosy Be on the north west coast of Madagascar, which was occupied by Vichy French forces. Transferring to the Mediterranean again, Manxman was sent with supplies to Malta, followed by mine-laying in the Sicilian Channel. On 1 December, whilst in transit from Algiers to Gibraltar, she was torpedoed by and severely damaged at the position . Following emergency repairs at Oran and Gibraltar, she returned to Newcastle-upon-Tyne for extensive repair work. Manxman was re-commissioned on 10 April 1945 and made ready to join the British Pacific Fleet. She arrived at Geelong shortly after VJ Day and she was used for repatriation and supply operations. Post-war Returning to the UK in June 1946, she had a further spell with the Pacific Fleet before joining the Reserve Fleet at Sheerness. Following a refit, Manxman joined the Mediterranean Fleet in 1951. In 1953, she appeared in the film Sailor of the King as the German cruiser Essen. She was fitted for the film with enlarged funnels and mock-up triple-gun turrets over her 4-inch guns. The 'torpedo damage' which forces her delay at 'Resolution Island' was painted on the side of her port bow. The scenes when she is holed up for repairs were filmed in the semi-circular Dwejra bay, guarded by Fungus Rock on the west coast of Gozo Island in Malta. In 1953 she also took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden In 1956, she was deployed for headquarters duties during the Suez operation. A story - or legend - has grown that, during the Suez Crisis of 1956, Manxman outran an American Carrier Group. Manxman reportedly shadowed them; the US Admiral increased speed, eventually to over thirty knots - and then Manxman swept past at full speed, showing the signal \\"See you in Egypt\\". It is far from clear whether this episode happened; 'knowledge' about it was common in the Merchant Navy of the 1970s. This story was often told in the Royal Navy (not the Merchant Navy which is not technically an organisation), long before 1956; it was supposed to have happened in the Pacific at the end of World War II. In reserve at Malta and refitting She was refitted in Chatham in the early 60's and converted to a minesweeper support vessel. When the forward boiler was removed and the compartment was fitted with diesel generators to supply outboard power to minesweepers, she was fitted with a dummy forward funnel, which housed the diesel exhausts and ventilation for the compartment. Much of the mine stowage was removed to make way for additional accommodation. Commissioning in 1963, she was subsequently stationed in Singapore. Returning to the UK in 1968, Manxman was used for engineering training at Devonport and following a fire, was transferred to the reserve at Chatham Dockyard until broken up at Newport in 1973.

Plot A cleaner goes into the office of a banker. He tells the staff to leave then proceeds to change into a suit and place a picture on the desk of two brothers. Lardier, a courier, arrives and the man proceeds to explain to him that he has several financial options available. However a cell phone rings and Lardier hands it over to the man. The caller, who is angry, shouts down the phone. Uncomfortable the man tries to leave but is shot with a silenced pistol several times by Lardier. The man who died was the brother of Cash. Cash is under surveillance by Lieutenant Julia Molina from Interpol. He is part of a gang who are running a confidence trick on a group of mercenaries ‚Äì led by Letallec ‚Äì who think they are buying impeccable printing plates for counterfeiting Euros. On returning to her headquarters, she is informed by her boss, Barnes, that another senior agent, Finley, are both in the running for his job. She asks if she can follow Cash in order to get an arrest that would help her promotional chances. Molina also discovers that Maxime, a master-criminal, is back in town and that her rival has an investigative advantage. Molina then observes Cash as he begins work on his next victim, Garance, a wealthy heiress. However the mercenaries ‚Äì who have discovered that the plates are fake ‚Äì catch up with Cash forcing him to flee through the streets. Molina eventually catches up with Cash in her surveillance vehicle and offers to hide him inside. She then uses this opportunity to force him to take her into his confidence. Cash explains he is running a con on the wealthy father of this heiress. He asks Molina to accompany him to a charity auction the man is hosting at his home in the country. Following the event, in which Cash paid ‚Ç¨18,000 to help protect a hippopotamus in Africa because he started to have feelings for the daughter, the rich father is revealed to be none other than Maxime who ran the charity auction as his own con on Cash and his gang. His \\"daughter\\", who turns out to be one of his gang, berates Cash for being such a sucker for love. Maxime also explains that the con was to see whether Cash was smart enough to join his own gang; but he failed. He is told that another man, named Vincent, will have his role. In revenge Cash loses at poker in order to palm off a few fake euro notes to the gloating Vincent, who is picked up later trying to use them at racecourse. Cash then gets the call that he will join the gang. Maxime explains that they are to do a heist on the French Riviera. They are going to steal ‚Ç¨30million worth of untraceable diamonds from a ruthless South African mine owner who is going to use the stones to pay his mercenary army that protects and controls his business interests. Maxime runs through an elaborate plan ‚Äì to break into the hotel's vault ‚Äì where each team members plays a pivotal role. In a private moment, Maxime also reveals that he knows Molina's real identity but states she can join in and get her share if she helps. But when Molina returns to Interpol she is greeted by LeBlanc and LeBrun, two charmless agents from Interpol's Internal Affairs division in Brussels, who are looking into the backgrounds of the candidates seeking promotion. They question Molina about her investigations and her methods. They also mention that they are looking into rumors that some of the money seized in raids had gone missing. Molina goes to the pool hall owned by Cash's mentor, Fran√ßois. Cash explains that Maxime now needs all of them for the job. Barnes and Finley pick up Lardier after a tip off. During questioning they start to get around to the killing at the bank a year before. Molina finds LeBlanc and LeBrun waiting in her flat after trashing it looking for evidence in their own investigations. The gang has rigged the hotel with CCTV and ask Molina to monitor them. However the mercenaries that bought the fake counterfeiting plates turn up and grab Cash. Seizing the moment that this commotion brings, Fran√ßois goes to the South African mine owner's room with a gun to grab the diamonds. Fran√ßois explains that his gang is double-crossing Maxime while they go down to the hotel vault. The jewels were never placed in any safe, they are really in the South African's room. Molina says she will go with him. But just outside the door she takes Fran√ßois' gun. The Interpol agent then enters the room, pistol whips a guard, and takes the jewel case for herself. After being tripped by a little boy, she eventually escapes in one of the gang's waiting boat but not before shooting one of them on the way. The little boy walks up to Garance and cries \\"mummy\\" who is then joined by Cash. The con is then explained. Maxime was working with Cash to set up Molina because she ordered Lardier to kill Cash's brother. He died because she realised he was conning her out of the money she had accumulated from skimming confiscated loot taken in her Interpol raids. When she tripped, the gang switched the jewel case. Molina now realises she's been set up for the robbery and the mercenaries are intent on killing her. The entire gang, including Letallec and Vincent, gather on the hotel terrace and toast themselves and Cash's dead brother.

Ziketan town covers approximately and has a population of 10,000. Ziketan is southwest of the Qinghai provincial capital of Xining. Ziketan lies approximately west of Beijing. 2009 pneumonic plague outbreak The outbreak in Ziketan was first detected on Thursday, July 30, 2009. On August 2, the authorities quarantined Ziketan after a dozen people were sickened with pneumonic plague, a lung infection that can kill a human in 24 hours if left untreated. Police checkpoints were set up in a radius around Ziketan, and residents were not allowed to leave. The streets were largely deserted and most shops shut, and 23 quarantine stations were set up in the town. The quarantine zone covered an area of centred on the town. The first casualty was a 32-year-old herder who had fallen ill after burying his dog, which had died suddenly after eating a marmot infected with the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The dog's owner caught the disease while burying the dog, according to professor Wang Hu, director of the Qinghai disease control bureau. The herder died four days after the dog's burial, and the relatives who handled his funeral were showing symptoms within days. The 10 people sickened, mostly relatives of the herder, were undergoing isolated treatment in hospital, managed by the local health bureau. Police guarded the quarantine center at the township hospital. On Sunday, a 37-year-old man identified only as Danzin, a neighbour of the first victim, became the second reported fatality from the outbreak. On Monday, a 64-year-old man named Danzhi, a neighbour of the first two victims, was the third fatality. As of August 6, no new cases of pneumonic plague had been found beyond the 12 patients in the town who were quarantined on July 31. As of August 6, three patients died and two were still in critical condition. The quarantine on the town was lifted on Saturday (2000 hrs, local time), August 8, 2009. This came after no reports of new infections for more than a week. =Preparedness and response= Authorities urged anyone who had visited Ziketan town since mid-July and has developed a cough or fever to seek hospital treatment. The World Health Organization office in China is in close contact with Chinese health authorities. More than 140 epidemic-prevention professionals from the Ministry of Health and provincial-level institutions were working in the area. In Ziketan, authorities have said homes and shops should be disinfected, and residents should wear face masks when they go out. Around 80 percent of the town's shops were closed on Monday, and prices of disinfectants and some vegetables have already tripled. County officials distributed flyers and made television and radio announcements on how to prevent infection. Medical workers in Ziketan were disinfecting and killing rodents and insects that can be carriers for the bacterium that causes the plague. Authorities are keeping close track of people who came into contact with those infected. This was the third outbreak of the disease in Qinghai within the last 10 years. Provincial health authorities in Qinghai and central government have been concerned about pneumonic plague for some years. As of February 2009, there were 55 teams across the province tasked to monitor and control the disease.

Œ±-Glucans (alpha-glucans) are polysaccharides of D-glucose monomers linked with glycosidic bonds of the alpha form. Œ±-Glucans use cofactors in a cofactor site in order to activate a glucan phosphorylase enzyme. This enzyme causes a reaction that transfers a glucosyl portion between orthophosphate and Œ±-I,4-glucan. The position of the cofoactors to the active sites on the enzyme are critical to the overall reaction rate thus, any alteration to the cofactor site leads to the disruption of the glucan binding site. Alpha-glucan is also commonly found in bacteria, yeasts, plants, and insects. Whereas the main pathway of Œ±-glucan synthesis is via glycosidic bonds of glucose monomers, Œ±-glucan can be comparably synthesized via the maltosyl transferase GlgE and branching enzyme GlgB. This alternative pathway is common in many bacteria, which use GlgB and GlgE or the GlgE pathway exclusively for the biosynthesis of Œ±-glucan. The GlgE pathway is especially prominent in actinomycetes, such as mycobacteria and streptomycetes. However, Œ±-glucans in mycobacteria have a slight variation in the length of linear chains, which point to the fact that the branching enzyme in mycobacteria makes shorter branches compared to glycogen synthesis. For organisms that can utilize both classic glycogen synthesis and the GlgE pathway, only GlgB enzyme is present, which indicates that the GlgB enzyme is shared between both pathways. Other uses for Œ±-glucan have been developed based on its availability in bacteria. The accumulation of glycogen Neisseria polysacchera and other bacteria are able to use in Œ±-glucan to catalyze glucose units to form Œ±-1,4-glucan and liberating fructose in the process. To regulate carbohydrate metabolism, more resistant starch was necessary. An Œ±-glucan coated starch molecule produced from Neisseria polysacchera was able to improve some of the physiochemical properties in comparison to raw normal starch, especially in loading efficiency of bioactive molecules. Alpha-glucan was used in conjunction with modified starch molecules that contained porous starch granules via hydrolysis with amylotic enzymes such as Œ±-amylase, Œ≤-amylase, and glucoamylase. An Œ±-glucan coating boasts protection from digestive environments, such as the small intestine, efficient encapsulation, and preservation rates. This design promotes the growth of the development of Œ±-glucan-based bio-materials and many implications for its usage in food and pharmaceutical industries.

It includes many geothermal features such as steaming lakes, mudpools, fumaroles, a mud volcano and the Kakahi Falls, the largest hot waterfall in the southern hemisphere. The area is operated under the name \\"Hells Gate\\", and offers self-guided and guided tours of the geothermal park, information about its history and MƒÅori culture, and a mud spa. \\"The Inferno\\" at Tikitere, 1913 Hells gate at Tikitere, 2019 History and culture The thermal area was formed approximately 10,000 years ago in a series of geothermal eruptions that drained an ancient lake and formed the Lake Rotoiti and Lake Rotorua. The absence of the pressure of the water on top of the rock caused it to create faults from which steam and gases can escape. At less than 2 km below ground, the heat source of this thermal area is shallower than most other thermal areas in the region. The local MƒÅori tribe NgƒÅti Rangiteaorere has lived in this area for more than 700 years and remain the owner of this geothermal attraction. Tikitere, the MƒÅori name for the area is derived from the tragic action of a MƒÅori princess, Hurutini, the young wife of an abusive and shameful chief, who threw herself into the boiling hot pool that bears her name today. Upon finding her daughter's body floating in the hot pool, Hurutini's mother cried out a sad lament \\"Aue teri nei tiki\\" (\\"here lies my precious one\\"), which was shortened to Tikitere and became the name from the thermal reserve and the surrounding area. \\"Hells Gate\\", its most commonly known name, was used following the visit to the geothermal reserve by noted Irish playwright, George Bernard Shaw in 1934 who likened the area to the comments that were made by his theologian colleagues back in England who were explaining to him that the result of the error of his ways as a practising atheist would result in his \\"going to hell\\". What he saw at Tikitere moved him to believe that this would be the gateway to hell. His visit to Tikitere was well received by the local MƒÅori owners of the land and as an honour to note the occasion of his visit, the owners decided that this would be the English name for the geothermal area. A destination spa operated at this site as early as 1871, using sulphurous waters from one of the hot pools and from Kakahi Falls. The Tikitere urban area includes Waiohewa Marae and Rangiwhakaekeau meeting house, belonging to NgƒÅti Rangiteaorere. Attractions Kakahi Falls The features of the geothermal park can be explored via two easy-walking, relatively flat loop walks, taking 45 to 60 minutes in total. The lower area is encircled by a loop walk with bridges and viewing platforms, and contains about a dozen hot pools such as \\"Sodom and Gomorrah\\" and \\"Devil's Bath\\", with depths of 15 to 25 metres. The water in the \\"Inferno Pools\\" and \\"Sodom and Gomorrah\\" reaches more than due to minerals in the water elevating its boiling point. Sodom and Gomorrah, named so by Shaw, has on occasion erupted 2 metres out of its pool. Most of the other pools have temperatures of . The water from the Huritini hot spring is used in Hells Gate's sulphur spas. The pH level of the water in the pools is typically 3.5 to 5, with the more acidic \\"Ink Pots\\" having a pH level of 2, and the \\"Sulphur Bath\\" reaching pH 1. Several other geothermal features in this area also bear names given by Shaw. Separating the lower and upper area is a short easy- walking bush walk along the stream flowing over the Kakahi Falls. This 4 metres tall cascade is the largest hot waterfall in the southern hemisphere and has a water temperature of around . The waterfall has always been a special place for local MƒÅori, with warriors using it to cleanse themselves after battles, the sulphur in the water disinfecting wounds. The waterfall's full name is \\"O Te Mimi O Te Kakahi\\", named after a chief and noted warrior of NgƒÅti Rangiteaorere. The stream itself is the overflow from the upper geothermal area. View across hot pools in upper area Hot pools in 2019 A larger loop walk takes in the upper geothermal area, which contains expansive hot pools of varying activity as well as steaming fumaroles. Sulphur crystals can be observed in some parts of this area, as well as several mud cauldrons with boiling black mud. This area also contains a large mud volcano, which is currently around 2 metres tall. Mud typically bubbles violently in the crater of the volcano, but the mud volcano hardens roughly every 6 weeks. A mud eruption follows pressure build-up over 2-3 days, splattering mud over 2 metres around the volcano. The Steaming Cliffs pool has the highest temperature of all pools in this geothermal area at at the surface. Other pools in the upper area range from around and were traditionally used for cooking, and medicinal purposes such as treating skin diseases and arthritis. The grey mud and water from one of the pools is used in Hells Gate's mud spa. Hells Gate's mud spa, adjacent to the entrance, offers mud footpools and several mud baths, and a list of mud packages, therapies and massages. Mud- based beauty products available at the on-site shop. Hells Gate also offers educational programmes for schools.

This way, some fact (for example, knowledge of a certain secret number) can be publicly proven without revealing underlying information. The technique is due to Amos Fiat and Adi Shamir (1986). For the method to work, the original interactive proof must have the property of being public-coin, i.e. verifier's random coins are made public throughout the proof protocol. The heuristic was originally presented without a proof of security; later, Pointcheval and Stern proved its security against chosen message attacks in the random oracle model, that is, assuming random oracles exist. This result was generalized to the quantum-accessible random oracle (QROM) by Don, Fehr, Majenz and Schaffner, and concurrently by Liu and Zhandry. In the case that random oracles do not exist, the Fiat‚ÄìShamir heuristic has been proven insecure by Shafi Goldwasser and Yael Tauman Kalai. The Fiat‚ÄìShamir heuristic thus demonstrates a major application of random oracles. More generally, the Fiat‚ÄìShamir heuristic may also be viewed as converting a public-coin interactive proof of knowledge into a non-interactive proof of knowledge. If the interactive proof is used as an identification tool, then the non-interactive version can be used directly as a digital signature by using the message as part of the input to the random oracle. Example For the algorithm specified below, readers should be familiar with the laws of modular arithmetic, especially with multiplicative groups of integers modulo n with prime n. Here is an interactive proof of knowledge of a discrete logarithm. # Peggy wants to prove to Victor the verifier that she knows x: the discrete logarithm of y = g^x to the base g (mod n). # She picks a random v\\\\in \\\\Z^*_q, computes t = g^v and sends t to Victor. # Victor picks a random c\\\\in \\\\Z^*_q and sends it to Peggy. # Peggy computes r = v - cx and returns r to Victor. # He checks whether t \\\\equiv g^ry^c. This holds because g^ry^c = g^{v - cx}g^{xc} = g^v = t. Fiat‚ÄìShamir heuristic allows to replace the interactive step 3 with a non-interactive random oracle access. In practice, we can use a cryptographic hash function instead. # Peggy wants to prove that she knows x: the discrete logarithm of y = g^x to the base g. # She picks a random v\\\\in\\\\Z^*_q and computes t = g^v. # Peggy computes c = H(g,y,t), where H() is a cryptographic hash function. # She computes r = v - cx. The resulting proof is the pair (t,r). As r is an exponent of g, it is calculated modulo q-1, not modulo q. # Anyone can check whether t \\\\equiv g^ry^c. If the hash value used below does not depend on the (public) value of y, the security of the scheme is weakened, as a malicious prover can then select a certain value x so that the product cx is known. Extension of this method As long as a fixed random generator can be constructed with the data known to both parties, then any interactive protocol can be transformed into a non-interactive one.

Here, it is inundated with tidal water from the Salisbury Bay (Chignecto Bay) a kilometer to the site of a former dam, making for a large estuary and inter-tidal zone. Its watershed catchment drains a large area in and outside the park, made up of tributaries and their sub-units including Kinnie Brook, Laverty, Forty-five River, Lake Brook, Greenough Brook, and others. It is a sub-unit within the Chignecto Bay North Watershed, an area designated under the UNESCO Programme on Man and the Biosphere. Macro-regionally, it is part of the Gulf of Maine watershed.  History  Its name hints at the clarification needed to distinguish the \\"salmon rivers\\". More than one Salmon River existed in Saint John County and elsewhere in the bay. Some are only a few miles apart. Early land claims on the river were delayed by confusion over the exact river, and it wasn't until the matter was settled in a court of law. But it is also now referred to as the Alma River. In the settlement's heyday, the river and the village were both named for the Salmon River. It was severed from Saint John, and in 1856 the area was established within Albert County, by Legislative authority, as Alma Parish, after the Crimean War battle.  Ecosystems  The inter-tidal areas are teeming with life, as it is said these are some of the most productive ecosystems in the world. Currently, researchers are tagging and tracking Atlantic Salmon and American Eels in order to better understand the anadromous fish and their habitats.

History =Malheur Valley Railway= Malheur Valley Railway built a branch line of the Oregon Short Line Railroad (OSL), beginning at that company's main line south of Ontario, Oregon, U.S., and extending west through the valley of the Malheur River to Vale, then northwest to Brogan. The company was incorporated on January 26, 1906, and opened its first section of road on January 15, 1907, under lease to the OSL, then an operating subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad. Construction between Vale and Brogan was aided by the Willow River Land and Irrigation Company. On December 23, 1910, new UP subsidiary Oregon‚ÄìWashington Railroad and Navigation Company (OWR&N;) acquired the property of the Malheur Valley Railway, but the line continued to be operated under lease by the OSL. The OWR&N; subsequently built a line west from Vale, eventually reaching Burns, and also leased this Ontario‚ÄìBurns Branch to the OSL. (This became moot in 1936, when the UP leased the OSL and OWR&N.;Moody's Transportation Manual, 1992, p. 111) The line eventually expanded north from Burns into what is now the Malheur National Forest, where it split up into several branches. =WYCO= In November 1989, the Wyoming Colorado Railroad bought the entire Ontario‚ÄìBurns Branch, including the old Malheur Valley Railway east of Vale, and abandoned the portion east of Celatom in June 1992.Union Pacific Railroad, Short Line Railroad Directory: Wyoming Colorado Railroad Company, Inc.

Alverson's fifth studio release, titled Country to the Bone, was his debut on Palo Duro Records. The album won the 2007 Best Country and Western Music Award from Fort Worth Weekly, and was released at Alverson's 10th annual Texas Music Family Gathering. Country to the Bone Country to the Bone started out as a redo of some older Alverson compositions, before it morphed into more of an homage to some of his favorite songwriters, from Jim Lauderdale and Doug Sahm to Mickey Newbury, Clay Blaker and the team of Roy Robinson (aka Amos Staggs) and Jerri Lynn Robinson. One special guest was Pauline Reese, who sang with Alverson on \\"Tequila Rose\\", a Robinson/Robinson composition that Alverson turned into a duet. In the July 2007 Cowboys & Indians magazine, Palo Duro label founder Chris Thomas listed \\"Texas Woman\\" as one of his favorite tracks, calling it, \\"one of the finest love songs ever written.\\" It also includes \\"Got Here as Fast as I Could,\\" a song that might serve as the answer to Lyle Lovett's \\"That‚Äôs Right (You‚Äôre Not From Texas).\\" He offers props to another hero in \\"Just Like Hank,\\" a song borrowed from pal Walt Wilkins and co-writer Davis Raines.

She served during the American War of Independence, the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic Wars in a career that spanned over forty years. She had a number of notable commanders during this period, and saw action in several single-ship actions against French and American opponents. She took several privateers during the American War of Independence, though one of her most notable actions was the recapture of , a Royal Navy frigate that a French squadron had captured nearly three weeks earlier and a French prize crew was sailing to France. Carysfort engaged and forced the surrender of her larger opponent, restoring Castor to the British, though not without a controversy over the issue of prize money. Carysfort spent the later French Revolutionary and early Napoleonic Wars on stations in the East and later the West Indies. Carysfort returned to Britain in 1806 where she was laid up in ordinary. The Admiralty finally sold her in 1813. Construction and commissioning The Admiralty ordered Carysfort from Sheerness Dockyard in February 1764 and laid down there in June that year. Master shipwright John Williams oversaw her construction until June 1765, and William Gray took over until her completion. She was named on 29 July 1765 and launched on 23 August 1766. She was completed by 11 August 1767, after the expenditure of ¬£11,101 14s 11d to build, plus ¬£1,614 13s 3d on fitting her out. Early years and American War of Independence Carysfort commissioned under her first commander, Captain George Vandeput in June 1767, and sailed for the Mediterranean in September that year. Vandeput remained in command until 1770, when in February Captain William Hay replaced him. Hay continued in the Mediterranean until May, when he sailed to Jamaica. On that trip she ran aground in the Straits of Florida. Carysfort Reef there is named for her. Hay and Carysfort briefly returned to Britain in 1771, before journeying back to Jamaica in April 1772. She was paid off in July 1773 and spent some time laid up. Carysfort began to be fitted for foreign service at Chatham Dockyard in September 1775, a process that had been completed by February 1776. She was then recommissioned in December 1775 under Captain Robert Fanshawe. Fanshawe sailed to North America in April 1776, but returned the following year where she was again fitted out, this time at Plymouth. In 1778, again in service in North America with Captain Fanshawe, she transported troops on a raiding expedition led by Major General Charles Grey.Nelson, Paul. Sir Charles Grey, First Earl Grey: royal soldier, family patriarch. p. 64 She paid off again in late 1778, but in late 1779 she was reactivated and began to be fitted for service in the English Channel. She joined the Downs squadron under her new captain, William Cumming, and on 13 June 1780 she captured the privateer Esp√©rance. Cumming was replaced in November 1780 by Captain William Peacock, and in December Carysfort returned to operate in North American waters. On 24 May 1782 she captured the American privateer General Galvez. Captain John Markham briefly took command in December 1782, and next month Carysfort was paid off again. Interwar period and French Revolutionary Wars Carysfort underwent a great repair in mid-1785, and returned to service in January 1787, having commissioned the previous month under Captain Matthew Smith. She served in the Mediterranean for three years, paying off in 1790. After a further period spent laid up, Carysfort was prepared for active service again after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, and recommissioned in August 1793 under Captain Francis Laforey. =Carysfort and Castor= While off Land's End on 29 May 1794 she came across , sailing under French colours. The Castor, originally under Captain Thomas Troubridge, had been captured twenty days earlier by a French squadron under Joseph-Marie Nielly during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794. Castor was being sailed back to France by a French prize crew at the time she was discovered, and was towing a Dutch brig. The French cast off the brig and fought Carysfort for an hour and a quarter, before surrendering. Carysforts casualties amounted to one dead and four wounded, while the French in Castor had 16 killed and nine wounded. One master's mate and eighteen seaman of the original crew were released after the recapture, but Troubridge and most of the British crew had been taken aboard Nielly's flagship, Sans Pareil, and would have to wait for the defeat of the French fleets at the Glorious First of June and the capture of Sans Pareil before they could be freed. Carysfort towed Castor to a British port, but a dispute then arose over the matter of prize money. The naval commissioners decided that since Castor was being taken to a French port, she was not yet a French warship, and that Carysfort had merely recovered the British ship. This meant Laforey and his crew were entitled to some salvage rights, but not the more lucrative bounty of prize money. Laforey protested and the case went to Sir James Marriott, the judge of the High Court of Admiralty. The captured French captain was called upon to give evidence, and reported that Nielly was empowered to 'condemn, arm, fit-out, and equip, all such prizes as he might think calculated for the service of the French republic.' Marriott determined that Castor fulfilled the criteria of such a ship, and therefore awarded her full value to Laforey and the men of Carysfort. Also, in 1847 the men of Carysfort were authorized the Naval General Service Medal with the clasp \\"Carysfort 29 May 1794\\"; however, none came forward to claim theirs. French Revolutionary Wars Captain John Murray took command of Carysfort in 1795, and left Britain for the East Indies in February 1796. Carysfort remained in the East Indies for the next few years, passing under the command of Captain Thomas Alexander in March 1796. On 19 August that year Alexander captured the 16-gun French corvette Alerte, a privateer requisitioned by the French government. She sailed from France for the East Indies with the squadron under Admiral Sercey. There Sercey sent her to visit the Danish post at Trinquebar to gather information about the disposition of the British navy in the East Indies. On his way the captain encountered Carysfort in the dark, and mistaking her for a merchant vessel, attacked.Roche (2005). Carysfort captured Alerte, and with her, papers describing Sercey's plans and route.James (1837), Vol. 1, pp.349. This led on 9 September to an indecisive action between Sercey's squadron and and . In December Captain John Turnor succeeded Murray. Turnor was replaced by Captain William Hills in 1798, and he by Captain Volant Vashon Ballard in December 1798. He remained with her until mid-1800. Between April and June 1801 Carysfort was at Portsmouth undergoing fitting. Captain Adam Drummond (later Vice Admiral of the Red) assumed command of Carysfort in 18May 1801. Carysfort and escorted five transports carrying the 85th Regiment of Foot and forty artillerymen from Cowes on 24 June. They arrived in Portsmouth on 28 June and then sailed again on a \\"secret mission\\". They had to put back into Torbay on 11 July.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.80 and 82. The secret mission saw Carysfort spending several months off Madeira during the British occupation. She returned from Madeira on 2 September. Carysfort sailed again on 26 January 1802 on an anti-smuggling patrol and returned on 26 February. Drummond paid Carysfort off in May 1802. His replacement was Captain George Mundy in May 1802. In June she participated in a small anti-smuggling squadron under the command of Captain King of .Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, p.81. The other vessels in the squadron were , , and .Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, p.172. On the 11th, the vessels were ordered to embark victuals for two months. They were cruise from Berry Head to Mount's Bay, an area \\"infested with smugglers\\". Captain Robert Fanshawe replaced Mundy in September 1802, only to be superseded by Captain John Woolcombe. Napoleonic Wars On 26 March 1804, she sailed from Cork with a convoy of sixty-seven merchantmen, together with . The convoy immediately encountered a strong gale. At 3:30 in the morning of 2 April Apollo unexpectedly ran aground about nine miles south of Cape Mondego on the coast of Portugal. Soon after 25 or 26 of the vessels in the convoy, traveling closely behind due to the low visibility and bad weather, were also wrecked. Next day some more vessels were wrecked. In all, 29 vessels ran aground.Hepper (1994), pp.104-5. Carysfort had shifted course on the evening of 1 April and so escaped grounding. She gathered the 38 surviving vessels and proceeded with the convoy.The New annual register, or General repository of history, politics, and literature (1805), pp.54-5. Carysfort sailed to Jamaica in March 1804, and came under Captain Kenneth McKenzie in March 1806. In July 1806 Captain Philip Carteret of Scorpion helped McKenzie save sixty-five deeply laden merchantmen from destruction at St. Kitts. Carteret sent a letter to the Governor at Nevis who warned McKenzie that a French squadron under Admiral Willaumez had arrived at Martinique.Annual Biography, Vol. 13-14, pp.239-40. Carysfort and the armed storeship Dolphin sailed leeward with their charges and so escaped the French, who had sailed from Fort Royal on 1 July.James (1837), Vol. 4, p.203-4. The French squadron succeeded in capturing three merchantmen at Montserrat and another three and a brig at Nevis; the fort on Brimstone Hill (St. Kitt's) and a battery on the beach protected nine others that had missed the convoy, though the French did attack them. McKenzie took the Lutine in the West Indies on 24 March after a 30-hour chase, after Edward Berry's came up and blocked her escape. Lutine was a new French navy brig with a crew of 100 men under the command of M. Croquet Dechauteurs. She was 33 days out of Lorient and on her way to Martinique, but had captured nothing on her way. She was armed with 18 guns but had thrown two overboard during the chase. Berry reported that \\"she is a remarkably fine Vessel, quite new,... , is well appointed in every Respect; sails uncommonly fast, and is, in my Opinion, well calculated for His Majesty's Service.\\" The Navy concurred and took Lutine into service as . Fate Carysfort returned to Britain later in 1806 and was laid up at Deptford in August. Five years later she was sold for ¬£1,800 on 28 April 1813.

It houses two research/teaching laboratories co- administered by the University of Paris 6 (Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. The two laboratories are focused on Developmental Biology, and Oceanography. The facility traces it roots back a laboratory established in 1882 by Hermann Fol with the encouragement of Charles Darwin and continues to work to this day with organisms from the Bay of Villefranche Bay, including protists, ascidians, sea urchins and jellyfish. History Part of the Observatoire Oceanologique de Villefranche In 1809 Charles Alexandre Lesueur and Fran√ßois P√©ron are credited with discovering the exceptional diversity of zooplankton in the bays of Villefranche and Cap de Nice and they were the first to describe new species from the bay (P√©ron & Lesueur 1809). In the 1850s, the zoologist Carl Vogt visited Villefranche and studied the planktonic fauna found in the bay, notably the gelatinous zooplankton (Vogt 1852). He was followed by Johannes Peter M√ºller and Ernst Haeckel who both described planktonic protists, radiolaria, from the Bay of Villefranche (M√ºller 1858; Haeckel 1860). In 1882, encouraged by Darwin, the zoologist and discoverer of fertilization Hermann Fol along with Jule Barrois of the Universit√© de Lille, established a laboratory in Villefranche in a former Lazert building. They acquired use of buildings previously leased to the Russian Navy as a coal depot in 1884, the Gal√©riens and the Vielle Forge. Barrois and Fol were forced to give up the facility in 1888 at the demand of Alexis Korotneff of the University of Kiev who had frequented the laboratory in previous years and now wanted to establish a Russian research facility: The \\"Russian Zoological Station\\" (Mosse 1952) . Russian, French, and American biologists including Hipployte Pergallo, Aleksei Alekseevich Korotnev, Carl Vogt, Hermann Fol, Jules Henri Barrois, √âlie Metchnikoff and Louis Agassiz among others worked on the planktonic fauna and embryos collected in the bay. To this day the Bay of Villefranche remains an exceptional natural resource for the study of plankton. Since the 1930s the facility has been administered by the University of Paris. Building Station Zoologique Vilefranche-sur-mer, ca. 1909 The marine station is situated in historical buildings constructed in 1769 as part of the military harbour of the Kingdom of Sardinia which had Turin as its capital. The main building (b√¢timent des galeriens) where the laboratories are now located was first used as a hospital and prison for galley slaves (mainly Turkish prisoners) who manned the war boats built in the adjacent drydock. In 1858 it was leased to the Russian Navy by the then governing authority of the Kingdom of Sardina for use as coal depot. Mission * Education: a teaching team composed of faculty members of Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie oversees many courses in oceanography for French and foreign students enrolled primarily at master's degree level. * Research: the two laboratories are focused on developmental biology and cell biology and the other on oceanography (biological, biochemical, physical and chemical oceanography). * Observation: Comprehensive monitoring programs sample both the coastal environment of the Bay of Villefranche and an offshore site, 28 miles from Cap Ferrat. Activities in the Observatory include also research and development of new observation techniques such optical devices, gliders and floats. References *Haeckel E. 1860.

Licensed to Dunnellon, Florida, United States, the station is currently owned by Power Ministries. History The Federal Communications Commission issued a construction permit for the station on May 28, 2002. The station was issued the WRLE-LP call sign on June 5, 2002, and received its license to cover on February 3, 2004. WRLE-LP began regular broadcasts in 2002 after longtime area broadcaster Tony Downes received a construction permit for the new low-power FM station. Downes wanted a community outreach radio station primarily to serve the residents of Rainbow Lakes Estate near Dunnellon in West Marion County. The call letters, WRLE, stand for Rainbow Lakes Estates. In 2002, WRLE went on the air. The original format was contemporary hits, known as \\"The Heat\\", with some religious programming on Sundays and other times during the weekends. However, since most of the residents living within the WRLE listening area are over 45, in 2003 the format was switched to soft adult contemporary. The Sunday morning programming includes Day One and The Lutheran Hour. According to Downes, this brought the station's programming more in tune with the station's desired target audience which has a median age of 45. The strategy has worked. WRLE is well received by the area residents and enjoyed by many. High school sports is another big part of WRLE's success. Each Friday evening during the football season, Dunnellon's Tiger football can be heard live over WRLE with Downes calling the play-by-play action. No other radio station in the area carries any local sports.

Elements specific to American Gothic include: rationality versus the irrational, puritanism, guilt, the uncanny (das unheimliche), ab-humans, ghosts, and monsters.  Analysis of major themes  The inability of many Gothic characters to overcome perversity by rational thought is quintessential American Gothic.Allan Lloyd Smith, American Gothic Fiction: An Introduction pp. 65‚Äì69 (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003) It is not uncommon for a protagonist to be sucked into the realm of madness because of his or her inclination towards the irrational. A tendency such as this flies in the face of higher reason and seems to mock 18th-century Enlightenment thinking as outlined by \\"Common Sense (pamphlet)\\" and The Age of Reason. Also, one cannot ignore the contemporary Gothic themes of mechanism and automation that rationalism and logic lead to. Puritan imagery, particularly that of Hell, acted as potent brain candy for 19th- century authors like Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne.George Parsons Lathop, A Study of Hawthorne pp 300-309 (Scholarly Press, 1970) The dark and nightmarish visions the Puritan culture of condemnation, reinforced by shame and guilt, created a lasting impact on the collective consciousness. Notions of predestination and original sin added to the doom and gloom of traditional Puritan values. This perspective and its underlying hold on American society ripened the blossoming of stories like \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\", \\"Young Goodman Brown\\", and The Scarlet Letter. The dungeons and endless corridors that are a hallmark of European Gothic are far removed from American Gothic, in which castles are replaced with caves. Lloyd-Smith reinterprets Moby-Dick to make this point convincingly.Allan Lloyd Smith, American Gothic Fiction: An Introduction pp. 79‚Äì87 (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004) Early settlers were prone to fear linked to the unexplored territory which surrounded, and in some cases, engulfed them. Fear of the unknown stemming from environmental factors like darkness and vastness is notable in Charles Brockden Brown's Edgar Huntly. The emergence of the \\"ab-human\\" in American gothic fiction was closely coupled with the emergence of Charles Darwin's theories of evolution.Allan Lloyd Smith, American Gothic Fiction: An Introduction page 114 (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004) Ideas of evolution or devolution of a species, new biological knowledge, and technological advancement created a fertile environment for many to question their essential humanity. Parallels between humans and other living things on the planet were made obvious by the aforementioned. This is manifest in stories like H.P. Lovecraft‚Äôs \\"The Outsider\\" and Nicholson Baker's \\"Subsoil\\". Ghosts and monsters are closely related to this theme; they function as the spiritual equivalent of the abhuman and may be evocative of unseen realities, as in The Bostonians. Julia Kristeva's concepts of jouissance and abjection are employed by American Gothic authors such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman.Allan Lloyd Smith, American Gothic Fiction: An Introduction pp. 94‚Äì108 (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004) Kristeva theorizes that the expulsion of all things defiling, much like a corpse, is a common coping mechanism for humanity. Gilman's \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" exploits this concept. Furthermore, \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" can be read as a social commentary on the oppressive conditions women suffered in their home lives at the turn of the 20th century.  Early American Gothic  The first publication of \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" by Edgar Allan Poe in The Pioneer edited by James Russell Lowell, 1843.Early American Gothic writers were particularly concerned with frontier wilderness anxiety and the lasting effects of a Puritanical society. \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" by Washington Irving is perhaps the most famous example of American Colonial era Gothic fiction. As mentioned above Charles Brockden Brown was deeply affected by these circumstances, as can be seen in Wieland (novel). Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Washington Irving are often grouped together. They present impressive, albeit disturbing, portraits of the human experience. Poe accomplished this through the window of a diseased and depressive fascination with the morose, Irving with the keen charm of a masterful storyteller, and Hawthorne with familial bonds to past abominations like the Salem Witch Trials which he addresses in \\"The Custom House.\\"  Southern American Gothic  The Southern Gothic includes stories set in the Southern United States, particularly following the Civil War and set in the economic and cultural decline that engulfed the region. Southern Gothic stories tend to focus on the decaying economic, educational and living standards of the post-Civil War South. There is often a heavy emphasis on race and class relations, while the rural environment provides an effective substitute for traditional Old World Gothic settings; for example, plantation estates fill the role of European castles. Some writers of Southern Gothic include William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor and Eudora Welty.  New American Gothic  Authors who fall under the category of \\"New American Gothic\\" include: Flannery O'Connor, John Hawkes and J.D. Salinger. These writers rely on the use of private worlds to weave their Gothic intrigue, as such the destruction of the family unit is commonplace in the New American Gothic. The psyche becomes the setting in the microcosms this particular brand of horror creates.Malin, Irving. \\"New American Gothic\\" pp.5-12 (Carbondale: Southern Illinois Press, 1962) Typically, these stories have a sort of \\"antihero\\"; an anxiety riddled individual of little admirable strength. These features are conspicuous in stories such as \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\", \\"The Laughing Man\\", Wise Blood, The Lime Twig and The Beetle Leg. Note: Flannery O'Connor is cross-referenced as a Southern Gothic author.

The National Trust for Historic Preservation accepted The Brazilian Court Hotel to be part of the Historic Hotels of America. In 1924 and 1925 two New York investors, Joseph D'Esterre and Stanley Paschal assembled the site of The Brazilian Court, at that time occupied by a few bungalows. They retained a rising young designer with whom Paschal had worked on apartment house projects in New York ‚Äì Rosario Candela. Candela, born in Sicily, arrived in the United States in the 1910s speaking only a few words of English. But by 1925 he was one of the top apartment house designers in New York, with a score of luxury buildings on Park and Fifth Avenues to his credit. Candela used a Mediterranean design for The Brazilian Court, with tinted, rough stucco, classical details and tiled roofs. Candela developed a simple courtyard model which emphasized the inner face of the building, rather than the street fa√ßade. It was organized as an apartment hotel, with small kitchens for the meals that guests chose not to take outside. In 2003, Obadon Hotels purchased The Brazilian Court, and renovated it from the formal setting of the 1920s to a more cosmopolitan style. In doing so, the kitchenettes were removed, and in their place opened a restaurant, Cafe Boulud, under the James Beard Award nominee, Chef Daniel Boulud. The hotel is located at 301 Australian Avenue. It is a National Trust for Historic Preservation and a Leading Hotel of the World.

Born in Strasbourg in 1873. He was the youngest son of four, born to a Jewish Alsacian family who fled to Paris after Germany took over Alsace in 1870. Gimpel worked for his family's fabric company, managed by his older brother Eugene. In 1897 his interest in photography was kindled when he acquired a Kodak detective camera, he soon swapped this for a Spido Gaumont which allowed him greater creative freedom. By 1900 he was working prodigiously, documenting the 1900 World's Fair in Paris. By 1904 his work was being published regularly in the magazines La Vie au Grand Air, La Vie Illustr√©e and L'Illustration. A restless and innovative photographer, Gimpel experimented with perspective, produced self-portraits using distorting mirrors and experimented with night time photography. At an air show at B√©th√©ny in August 1909, Gimpel ascended in an air ballon to photograph the crowds below, pioneering aerial photography. However it is his pioneering work in colour photography that he is most notable for. In 1904, Gimpel met Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re, who had just displayed their invention the autochrome to the Acad√©mie des Sciences. Limited by the long exposure time required, Gimpel used the process, to photograph still lifes and landscapes. Assisted by his colleague Fernand Monpillard, Gimpel modified the plates to produce \\"instant\\" colour pictures. Thanks to his works Gimpel was the only photographer who succeeded in capturing, in colour, scenes of everyday life during la Belle √âpoque. On 10 June 1907 Gimpel was the first photographer to have images published in color. A special edition of L'Illustration was published to demonstrate the new technology, it included an insert featuring four autochromes taken by Gimpel, a group of soldiers, two scenic views of Villefranche-sur-Mer and sunset at Lake Geneva. A few weeks later on 29 June 1907, Gimpel published the first color news photographs when L'Illustration published his picture of Frederick VIII of Denmark and his wife Louise of Sweden, who were visiting France at the time. Gimpel produced many works using the autochrome, arguably the most famous are the images known as The Grenata Street Army produced during the First World War. Gimpel befriended a group of children from the Grenata Street neighbourhood of Paris who had established their own 'army'. Under his guidance he helped them build their tanks and aircraft, documenting their 'battles' against the boche. On a more serious note Gimpel also recorded the French experience of the First World War visiting munitions factories and trenches on the Western Front. Gimpel married Marguerite Bouillon in 1939 and settled in B√©arn. He died in 1948 at S√©vignacq-Meyracq. Although largely forgotten, his work has experienced a revival recently. The band Beirut used one of his photographs as the inspiration behind their 2007 album The Flying Club Cup. A major respective took place at Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris in February 2008. His work helped influence the 2009 Spike Jonze film Where the Wild Things Are.

The street level stop located in an especially hilly portion of a neighborhood known for its rolling terrain, providing access to commuters within walking distance. The station is located along the South Busway at the south end of the Palm Garden trestle and also serves as a transfer opportunity to the one city bus that stops at the same location. History The original Dawn stop was established at the south end of the Palm Garden trestle where Dawn Avenue crossed the Pittsburgh Railways trolley right of way. In the 1950s the stop was served by the 38 Mt. Lebanon, 39 Brookline, 42 Dormont, and 43 Neeld services. Just south of the stop was a junction where the line continued on to West Liberty Avenue (service 38 and 39) with the branch to the west proceeding to Broadway (service 42 and 43). When the 38 Mt Lebanon line along West Liberty Avenue was abandoned on May 25, 1963, it was combined with the 42 Dormont and renumbered as 42/38 Mt. Lebanon/Beechview. However, the 42 Dormont continued as a separare service but for rush hour use only. All lines, except the 39 Brookline, eventually became the 42 South Hills Village, the current Red Line. The 39 Brookline was abandoned on Sep 3, 1966.

The episode aired in the United States on February 16, 2009 on Disney XD. The episode follows Phineas and Ferb finally being caught by Phineas' mother (and Ferb's stepmother) and sent to reform school, where a harsh and cruel sergeant attempts to destroy their imagination by sitting them down to a commercial about good boys that mind-controlled them. Candace goes to save them after she sees a news report about their horrible condition. The episode's story was written by the writing team Martin Olson and Bobby Gaylor and constructed into storyboard by Jon Colton Barry and Piero Piluso. Dan Povenmire, co-creator of Phineas and Ferb, directed it. The episode is titled \\"At Last!\\" in several countries, such as the United Kingdom. Talk show personality Geraldo Rivera and veteran actor Clancy Brown guest starred as television reporter Morty Williams and the school sergeant, respectively. Plot Phineas and Ferb rebuild Phineas' mother (and Ferb's stepmother) Linda's station wagon into a flying car and build a giant tower. Linda is furious after Candace drags her into the yard to see what the boys have done, and Phineas confesses that they've been doing similar things all summer, which prompts Linda to apologize to Candace for not believing her in the first place. Their father (and Phineas and Candace's stepfather), Lawrence, suggests forgiving Phineas and Ferb as they thought they had permission and Candace suggested several punishments to the boys, to which Lawrence agrees with, but the tower collapses, destroying part of the house. The parents send the boys to the \\"Smile Away Reformatory School\\", unaware that it is a prison where kids are brainwashed to remove their creativity. Candace, meanwhile, enjoys life without her brothers to bother her, hanging out with her friends and doing different fun activities with them. A few days later Candace is bored and tired after doing so much, she watches TV with her best friend Stacy. Candace gets haunted by sad consequences of her busting Phineas and Ferb and realizes that she has truly loved her brothers for their genius skills and did not realize it. She and Jeremy, take the flying car to go and save her brothers disguised as reporter Morty Williams and his camera man. Candace secretly asks Phineas and Ferb to escape with her and Jeremy. They reach the flying car and they see Linda and Lawrence, but the sergeant from the school arrives with a scheme to put Candace and Jeremy in the reform school with Phineas and Ferb. Dr. Doofenshmirtz and Perry the Platypus interrupt with their seemingly never- ending fight, knocking the sergeant off the cliff to his death. Perry and Doofenshmritz disappear and a series of strange events occur. The parents turn into marionettes controlled by a giant Baljeet, then Baljeet turns into one as well being controlled by a talking zebra, and Jeremy proposes to Candace. It turns out that all of this was Candace's dream. Candace tells the dream to her family at breakfast, even revealing Perry's secret identity making the family guess that when Perry goes away, he goes to defeat Dr. Doofenshmirtz. With Perry's cover blown, an army of OWCA (Organization Without a Cool Acronym) agents and Major Monogram burst into the house and arrest the Fletchers and Flynns to be mind-erased and relocate Perry to a new home. Just then, a whimpering Perry wakes up in Phineas's bed. The events of the entire episode were all just a bad dream. Phineas says \\"Ah, hey, Perry. What's wrong boy? You sounded like you were having a bad dream. It's okay now. Go back to sleep.\\" Phineas goes back to sleep. Perry smiles and also goes back to sleep. Production Series co-creator Dan Povenmire directed \\"Phineas and Ferb Get Busted\\". \\"Phineas and Ferb Get Busted\\" was written by Bobby Gaylor and Martin Olson as a story, but the storyboards were adapted and constructed by Jon Colton Barry and Piero Piluso. Robert F. Hughes and Zac Moncrief as well are credited for additionally writing for the episode. Dan Povenmire, the show's co-creator and executive producer, directed the episode. The episode is titled \\"At Last\\" in several countries, such as the United Kingdom. Latin America as well labels the episode name in its end credits for the episode, despite entitling it \\"Al Fin;\\" however, \\"Al Fin\\" literally translates to \\"At Last.\\" Geraldo Rivera guest starred as the voice of investigative talk show host Morty Williams. Clancy Brown, known for his work in The Shawshank Redemption, provided the voice of the drill sergeant. \\"Phineas and Ferb Get Busted\\" was originally broadcast in America as the premiere of season two on Presidents' Day, February 16, 2009 on Disney XD, at 4:30 PM Eastern/Pacific Time. It was followed by first season reruns aired in a marathon. Cultural references *The scene where Phineas and Ferb are strapped to seats and have their eyes forced open to watch films that attempt to destroy their imagination is a direct parody of the film A Clockwork Orange; in the latter, a young man is held down in the same fashion, being forced to watch acts of violence to rid himself of his own violent tendencies. *While Candace and Jeremy are driving the \\"Flying Car of the Future, Today,\\" a riff from the Back to the Future theme plays in the background. *The Smile Away Reformatory School is based on Alcatraz from the 1979 film, Escape from Alcatraz. *The scene where Candace wakes up and discovers that busting Phineas and Ferb and rescuing them was all just a dream is a reference to Pam Ewing waking up and discovering that her husband, Bobby is killed was all just a dream from the television series, Dallas. Even Perry had the same reference. Reception When the episode broadcast on Disney Channel on March 13, 2009, it garnered a total of 3.7 million viewers, 1.4 million of them ages 9‚Äì14. It was the series second most watched telecast, behind only \\"Flop Starz,\\" and was the top-rated in Kids 6-11 in almost 6 months, ranking in Phineas and Ferb's top four most watched in the category. Moreover, it was the day's most watched in Tweens 9-14 and Kids 6-11 and the most watched for cable television in total viewers. Matt Blum of Wired wrote about the episode, \\"if it‚Äôs any indication, the second season will be even more brilliant than the first season was.\\" Blum as well praised the appearance of Clancy Brown as a guest actor. One of the songs in the episode, \\"Little Brothers\\" was voted #4 on Phineas and Ferb's Musical Cliptastic Countdown.

It was originally published in September 1899 in Pearson's Magazine and collected in Sam Moskowitz's Science Fiction by Gaslight and Michael Moorcock's England Invaded. Plot The story is told through the extracts of a diary written from 1896 to 1897 by a professor and physician named James McLennegan, addressed to a colleague, Professor William G. Breyfogle. McLennegan had been studying Lake LaMetrie, a lake within the mountains of Wyoming. With him was a sickly boy named Edward Framingham, who came along in hopes of recovering from dyspepsia. McLennegan's reason for studying the lake is for its remarkable property of prehistoric life washing ashore, such as tree-like ferns and placoderms. McLennegan believes that the lake is connected to an ‚Äúinner earth‚Äù from which the plants and animals originate. One night, a loud roaring brings McLennegan's and Framingham's attention to the lake. The roaring is the result of the lake's rapid rising, which forces McLennegan and Framingham out of their makeshift house. The next morning, the lake's level is back to normal as the result of a whirlpool. McLennegan knows this to be one of the lake's discharges of strange life, and discovers what seems to be a short, thick log with a long root attached to it. The next day, while walking along the shore, McLennegan finds that the ‚Äúlog‚Äù is actually a live Elasmosaurus. The beast attacks him, but McLennegan slices the top of its head off with a machete and removes its brain, which is found to be remarkably a lot like a human's. Despite the brain's removal, the creature's body continues to operate. The next day, Framingham almost dies, with only his mind still functioning. Using his knowledge and skills of surgery, McLennegan removes Framingham's brain and grafts it into the Elasmosaurus‚Äôs head. Seven days later, the beast begins to stir, and five days after that, starts to interact with McLennegan ‚Äì the beast can understand him, and later is able to speak somewhat rudimentarily. Although the situation is peaceful at first, Framingham's behavior has significantly changed a year later to that of the animal his mind controls. McLennegan's last entry indicates that he will be leaving. The narrative is then revealed to have been found by a military captain, Arthur Fairchild, who discovered the beast eating McLennegan while searching for Native Americans who left their reservation. He had ordered the team to fire upon the creature, killing it, and found the manuscript with McLennegan's remains. Reception Algis Budrys said that the story was effective but wished that the author had further developed events.

In each path was a collimating objective lens, a screen marked with many small, alternating opaque and transparent squares in a chequerboard pattern, and a second concentrating lens focused on a photocell. The two screens were inverted with respect to each other.

Early life Seavey was born in Portland, Maine, on March 23, 1865. He left home at age 13 and became a sailor, serving for a short time in the United States Navy.Sandusky, link below He moved near Marinette, Wisconsin in the late 1880s, where he married Mary Plumley and had two daughters.Peterson, Lana. 1995. \\"Dan Seavey of Garden and Fayette Was Known as the Great Lakes Pirate.\\" The Manistique Pioneer-Tribune, (22 June). The family later moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Seavey fished, farmed and owned a local saloon. In 1898, Seavey left his family in Milwaukee to participate in the Klondike Gold Rush. He was unsuccessful, and returned to the Great Lakes region around 1900. Pirate In poverty, Seavey moved to Escanaba, Michigan and acquired a schooner, which he named the Wanderer, and began a career as a pirate. Seavey sailed the Wanderer as a legitimate shipping operation, but also sailed into ports at night to steal cargo from other vessels and warehouses. Seavey also kidnapped or transported women in the illegal prostitution trade, an early form of human trafficking and sex trafficking. Seavey was notorious for altering sea lights, either by extinguishing existing lights or placing false lights. The trick, known as \\"moon cussing\\", would cause ships to sail into rocks, where Seavey's crew could easily capture the cargo from the wounded vessel. A significant amount of Seavey's profit was made from venison poaching. When a company called Booth Fisheries attempted to compete with Seavey's illegal venison trade, Seavey attacked one of its ships with a cannon, killing everyone on board. Seavey's most infamous exploit was the hijacking of the schooner Nellie Johnson. On 11 June 1908,Criminal Justice Resources: Michigan's Only Pirate Seavey came aboard in Grand Haven, Michigan with a large amount of alcohol, which he offered to share with the crew. Once they became intoxicated, Seavey tossed them overboard and sailed the Nellie Johnson to Chicago, where he sold the cargo.There is some dispute about whether Seavey was able to sell the cargo. See Arrrr! Real Pirates Once Sailed On Lake Michigan. Some Even Plundered The Shores Of Chicago Website accessed 3 August 2009. The United States Revenue Cutter Service soon gave chase in the Tuscarora. Seavey, meanwhile, had moored the Nellie Johnson and was again sailing in the Wanderer. After several days, he was captured on June 29, 1908.SHOT STOPS A LAKE \\"PIRATE.\\"; Revenue Cutter Captures a Mariner After Seven Days' Chase. The New York Times, June 30, 1908.

Criminal Justice Resources :Michigan's Only Pirate but was officially charged with \\"unauthorized removal of a vessel on which he had once been a seaman\\". He was released on bond and the charges were later dropped when the owner of the Nellie Johnson failed to appear. For the rest of his life, Seavey maintained that he won the Nellie Johnson in a poker game. Later life and death At the end of his career, Seavey accepted a position with the United States Marshals Service, where he worked to curb poaching, smuggling, and piracy on Lake Michigan. The Wanderer was destroyed by fire in 1918 and Seavey purchased a 40-foot motor launch. It's unclear if he continued as a marshal or an outlaw, or both, but motor launches were a favorite of Great Lakes smugglers when Prohibition began in 1919. Seavey retired in the late 1920s and settled in Peshtigo, Wisconsin. He died at the Eklund nursing home in Peshtigo on February 14, 1949 at the age of 84. Seavey is buried next to his daughter in Forest Home Cemetery, Marinette, Marinette County, Wisconsin.

It was written as a third part of a trilogy named Things That Go Bump, uniting the cast of the first two plays: Haunting Julia (1994) and Snake in the Grass (2002). It is about a recently bereaved widow, Beth, troubled by her family's misguided support and a late husband who won't leave her alone. Background The history of this play dates back to 1994, when Haunting Julia was premi√®red. The cast was three men, but the play was dominated by Julia, once a gifted musician, now a ghost. In 2002, a female companion piece was premi√®red, named Snake in the Grass, with a cast of three women in a play dominated by the ghost of the father of two of them (and a much less savoury character than Julia). For some time, Alan Ayckbourn had considered writing a third play with a supernatural that combined the casts of these plays, but it was only after Susie Blake ‚Äì Miriam in the original Snake in the Grass ‚Äì contacted Ayckbourn about reprising her role that he said he would write this third play.Interview from Life and Beth programme, held on Ayckbourn site Life and Beth history on official Ayckbourn site This play was considerably lighter than the other two plays, and Ayckbourn considered it his equivalent to No√´l Coward's Blithe Spirit. This the first play to be written since Alan Ayckbourn's stroke in 2006. After the stroke, he doubted if he could return to writing, at some points considering giving it up and just directing.The Stage, 22 March 2007 The Independent, 24 August 2008 (If I Were You, the first new Ayckbourn play performed after his stroke, was written before the event.) He first revealed he was working on a new play in July 2007The Guardian, 6 July 2007 Originally titled Life After Beth (it was originally set after when Beth was the dead character), the title changed prior to its completion in that summer, and it was first publicly announced that the play would be performed as part of the 2008 summer season at the Stephen Joseph Theatre December 2007. Two months later it was announced that Ayckbourn's other two \\"ghost\\" plays would also be performed in this season as part of the Things That Go Bump trilogy.Scarborough Evening News, 19 February 2008 The play also coincided with Alan Ayckbourn's announcement that he was stepping down as Artistic Director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre.BBC News, 8 July 2008 Although Alan Ayckbourn would continue to write and direct for the theatre, and this wasn't quite his last new play whilst artistic director (the last one being a musical Awaking Beauty), Life and Beth was nonetheless seen as his farewell performance. Characters In keeping with the intention to combine the casts of the all-male Haunting Julia and all-female Snake in the Grass, there are six characters in the play. They are: * Beth, a recently bereaved widow, very much subservient to her husband during their marriage but now living her own life; * Gordon, Beth's late overbearing and pedantic husband, formerly a Health and Safety officer; * Connie, Gordon's alcoholic sister, marginalised by her family in favour of her brother; * David, the local vicar, with a badly-concealed longing for Beth; * Martin, Gordon and Beth's son, well- meaning but inheriting all of the wrong attributes of Gordon; * Ella, Martin's new chef girlfriend, overpowered by Martin's misplaced affection, silent (bar one exception) throughout the play. The view that Beth cannot manage without Gordon is shared by most of the characters ‚Äì Connie, David, Martin, and Gordon himself ‚Äì with Beth alone in believing she's coping. Life and Beth is the only play in the trilogy where a ghost is actually seen on stage, although it is never made completely clear whether he is a real ghost or just a figment of Beth's imagination. Setting The entire play takes place in the living room of what was Gordon and Beth's house, now very much Beth's house, also temporarily doubling up as her bedroom whilst guests are present. There is also a hatchway to the kitchen where some of the action takes place. The play takes place in two acts over 24 hours on Christmas. Act one takes place in a single scene on before dinner on Christmas Eve. Act Two takes place over two scenes: one scene overnight, and the second scene on the morning on Christmas Day. The Stephen Joseph Theatre production originally staged this production in the round, as was the first stop of the tour at the New Vic, Stoke-on- Trent. The rest of the performances on the tour were re-staged for the proscenium. It was originally intended to be the first Ayckbourn play featuring snow on stage, but this idea never made it into the final play. Synopsis The play begin with Beth and Connie sitting watching carols on television. Connie, in a one-sided conversation, gives praises for her late brother, Gordon. She does not seem to mind she spent childhood in the shadow of her brother, blatantly the family favourite and given all the support she never had. Although Beth quietly agrees with Connie's idea of her idyllic marriage to Gordon, she expresses subtle annoyance with Connie's idea that the whole family will have to look after her this first Christmas alone, and Connie's hints of self-pity don't help either. Beth is more concerned about the disappearance of her cat, Wagstaff, who disappeared on the day of the funeral. The local vicar who took the funeral, David, comes to supposedly give his condolences to Beth, and they discuss his death. Gordon was the Health and Safety officer for his company before he fell off a ladder trying to remove a man scared of heights. Gordon's injuries forced his early retirement and he later died from them. Once David starts talking about the death of his own wife, however, it transpires he has an obvious crush on Beth. Connie, at first interested in David herself (to the point of turning up to all his services), becomes more interested in matchmaking him to Beth when she mistakenly believes she is flirting back ‚Äì giving the game away when Beth catches her eavesdropping at the hatchway. David persuades Beth, under duress, to let him say a prayer for her. After being interrupted by the arrival of Beth's son, Martin, and his new chef girlfriend, Ella, he says a prayer, commemorating Gordon, and then asking for help for Beth now Gordon has gone (his unsubtle way of suggesting they get together). With David gone, Martin sets to work decorating the house with things Beth doesn't really want, such as an SUV-load of presents and a light-up reindeer on the front of the house, all in the name of idolising his father and his idea of Christmas. Meanwhile, he suffocates Ella with over-the-top affection, doing the talking for both of them. Ella remains morose and cringes whenever Martin embraces her. Whilst Ella nervously prepares dinner, Beth tries to keep Connie away from the wine. The dinner is a carefully arranged yet dubious salad that no-one really wants to eat. Martin tries to switch on the Christmas tree lights but ends up blowing a fuse. When the candle is lit, Gordon is sitting at his place on the table, and Beth faints. In Act Two, Beth is preparing a sofa bed (having given her own room over to Martin and Ella.) She has also fixed the electrics herself. Martin comes down, requesting entry to the room by saying \\"Knock knock\\", something Beth informs him is an annoying habit (to no avail ‚Äì he is doing it again later). He mentions he had a row with Ella, and Beth talks about her marriage to Gordon, but the key difference seems to be that is that whilst it took thirty year for Beth's marriage to become crushing, Martin seems to unwittingly do the same for all his girlfriends in a matter of days. The Police then arrive returning Connie, whom Beth failed to keep sober. Instead of returning from David's midnight mass, she was arrested by the Police trying to climb a statue of Oliver Cromwell (the previous year's incident being her attempt to ride the reindeer lights). Finally left alone, Beth turns out the lights only to be kept awake by the glow of the reindeer lights. She then hears a scratching which is not, as she hoped, Wagstaff, but her late husband, entering with his own rendition of \\"Knock knock\\". Gordon, now holding an equally bureaucratic desk job in heaven, has returned to look after Beth forever ‚Äì an unintended consequence, it transpires, of David's prayer asking Beth for help. It becomes clear that, before his death, Gordon micromanaged every part of Beth's life. Flatly refusing to consider Beth's suggestion not all of his help was wanted or that not all of their marriage was happy, he leaves, promising to come back tomorrow. Martin then returns with the news that Connie has been sick on the landing. In the final scene, on Christmas morning, Martin and Ella are packing to leave, supposedly because Ella received an unexpected order for a large buffet. Before they go, Martin tells Ella to say goodbye, and for a moment it looks like Ella might speak, but instead she runs away crying. Connie, after returning from Mass, apologises with an annoying amount of worthlessness until Beth snaps and tells her, in the politest way, to shut up. David arrives, called by Beth, and she asks if it is possible to reverse a prayer. A sceptical David agrees to say goodbye to Gordon, and during the prayer Gordon appears and challenges Beth to think if she can really manage without him. Beth shouts \\"Yes!\\" and a surprised Gordon vanishes. After David goes, Beth hears scratching from the hatch. Opening it, there is miaowing, half the items in the living room get knocked over, and the cushion in the cat basket is pressed down. Wagstaff, it seems, has returned.

Arts Archive performance listings for Life and Beth All the original cast took part in the end-stage tour except for Ian Hogg and Susie Blake, replaced by Terence Booth and Eileen Battye respectively. Critical Reviews Although the review of Life and Beth made mentions of Ayckbourn's upcoming departure as Artistic Director, they mostly concentrated on the play itself. They were broadly positive, though they stopped short of naming it one of Ayckbourn's best. Michael Billington in The Guardian wrote \\"Few dramatists in history have painted a more devastating picture of the emotional damage wrought by bullying men,\\" and described Martin's misguided affection for his girlfriends as \\"an instant image of a grisly inheritance\\".The Guardian review, 23 July 2008 Dominic Cavendish for The Daily Telegraph lauded the handling of death and bereavement with a light touch.The Daily Telegraph review, 28 July 2008 However, there was some disappointment that Life and Beth lacked the scariness of the first two parts of the trilogy. Also, Sam Marlowe, writing in The Times, although acknowledging the links with Blithe Spirit, opined that the characters weren't that believable.The Times review, July 24 2008 And in the Financial Times, Ian Shuttleworth, whilst highlighting several positives in the play, somewhat unkindly suggested Gordon might be Ayckbourn's caricature of himself hanging around the Stephen Joseph Theatre long after he should have departed.Financial Times review, 27 July 2008 External links * Life and Beth on official Ayckbourn site. * Arts Archive, UK performance listings.

The passengers insist on staying, as it is raining heavily and the nearest village is four miles away. Hodgkin warns them the station is haunted. A branch line once crossed the river on a swing bridge close to the station. One night 43 years ago, then stationmaster Ted Holmes had a fatal heart attack while attempting to close the bridge, causing a train to plunge into the river. Ever since, a phantom train has been heard periodically on the abandoned track. It is said to kill anyone who looks upon it. With that, he reluctantly leaves them. As the passengers make themselves as comfortable as they can, they hear footsteps outside. Richard opens the door, and Hodgkin collapses into the room. Dr. Sterling pronounces him dead. Later, a terrified young woman in black (Linden Travers) appears. She, Julia, pleads for help, saying that someone is pursuing her. A car spins off the road and crashes into a tree. The driver is unhurt, but his car is damaged. Back in the waiting room, he introduces himself as John Price (Raymond Huntley) and explains that he is searching for his sister Julia, who he says suffers from delusions. Julia protests that he is lying. Price further explains that she thought she had seen the ghost train, and became obsessed with it ever since. The passengers tell him that Hodgkin has died. When Price insists on seeing the body, they discover it has mysteriously vanished. Price leaves to arrange transportation. Then an approaching train is heard. As it thunders past, Julia smashes a window to look at it, then screams and faints. They hear singing from the nearby railway tunnel mouth. Julia claims that Ben Isaacs (D. J. Williams), the sole survivor of the accident, is coming back. Teddy shoots at the \\"ghost\\", causing it to flee back into the tunnel, leaving behind a bloodstained cloth. Teddy shows the others the cloth and orders the others, at gunpoint, to stay put until the police arrive, but Richard punches him, knocking him out. The passengers carry him to the bus Price has obtained. When Teddy comes to, he is furious with Richard, as now there will be no one to intercept the train on its return journey. When Gander remarks that he had returned the bridge to the open position, Dr. Sterling suddenly orders the bus driver to stop, while his confederate, Price, produces his own gun. Sterling orders the driver to turn back so they can warn the train. Meanwhile, guns are being loaded aboard the \\"ghost train\\"; a very much alive Hodgkin flags the train off and climbs aboard. Teddy explains that the train is really being used by Nazi Fifth Columnists to secretly transport arms. While Price heads down the embankment with Julia and the driver to try to stop the train, Teddy knocks Sterling out and gains control of the situation. The train plunges into the river.

The Askey version was announced in August 1939. The script had to be rewritten to accommodate Askey; the actions of Hulbert's part were divided between the comic star and Richard Murdoch. Filming did not proceed immediately; in January 1941 reports said Carol Reed would direct and Edward Black would produce. Eventually the job of directing went to Walter Forde who had made the 1931 version. Filming began in February 1941. It was an early role for Carole Lynn who had been discovered dancing on the West End. Shooting took place at the Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush, with sets designed by the art director Alex Vetchinsky. Some location shots were also taken around Teignmouth and Dawlish Warren in Devon.

Harwood Street in downtown Dallas, Texas (USA). The hotel is a contributing property in the Harwood Street Historic District and Main Street District. It is also located across the street from Main Street Garden Park. The Beginning The Hilton Hotel, built in 1925 for Conrad Hilton, was his first hotel to bear the \\"Hilton\\" name.History of the Aristocrat Hotel Dallas Conrad Hilton operated one of the two earliest hotel chains in the state, and went on to become a world leading hotel operator, with an international chain of hotels and resorts. Unlike his earlier hotels, which were bought and renovated but not built by Conrad Hilton himself, the new hotel in Dallas was designed by Hilton from the ground up to be a prominent high rise hotel. For the building site Hilton chose the highest point in downtown Dallas. Hilton retained the prominent architectural firm of Lang and Witchell, one of the two most respected firms in Dallas, to design the new hotel. They designed the hotel as a 14-story, reinforced concrete and masonry structure in a simplified Sullivanesque style with symmetrical facades and Beaux Arts detailing. Its horseshoe plan is similar to that of the Magnolia Building and features two massive towers projecting toward Harwood Street which form an open court. The towers were tied together on the main (Harwood) facade with a frontispiece entrance and an elaborate bridge at the l0th level. Ground was broken on July 25, 1924 and the building was completed just over one year later for a total cost of $1.36 million‚ÄîHilton's second most costly Texas highrise. The hotel officially opened on Thursday, August 6, 1925. Hilton maximized all available space in the public areas of the hotel for an assortment of vending services. The presence of the druggist, men's shop, barber shop, valet service, beauty shop, coffee shop, tailor, cigar/news stand, telegraph office, dining room and others dovetailed with Hilton's emphasis on service while the rents those services paid supplemented the finances of the operation. Not wanting to tie up capital in land ownership, Hilton introduced the idea of a 99-year land lease with the Dallas Hilton. The concept was well known in the East in 1925, but it was new to Texas commerce circles. Hilton's private offices were also located on the mezzanine level as were seven sample rooms with Murphy wall beds. The 325 guest rooms were typically small and were painted in colors of pearl gray and cream. The rooms and corridors were carpeted. Most had full baths, and the rest had half baths. Seventy-five percent of the rooms had south or east exposure for maximum ventilation; no rooms were located on the west. The competition of the luxurious Adolphus and Baker Hotels located just blocks away compelled Hilton to formulate a marketing strategy for attracting a new clientele ‚Äî \\"The Average Man\\" ‚Äî to whom a moderately priced, modern hotel of handsome design would appeal in a city where there were few alternatives. Changes During the Great Depression, Hilton lost four hotels and saved five, one of which was the Dallas Hilton. In 1938, he relinquished the operating lease of the Dallas Hilton after his move to California. George Loudermilk, the owner, contracted with another well known hotel operator in Texas, A. C. \\"Jack\\" White, in July 1938 to run the hotel. White changed the name of the hotel to the White Plaza. He also undertook improvements totaling $150,000, including improvements to the air conditioning system. The 325 rooms were converted to 234, all with private baths. Loudermilk resided at the hotel until his death in 1953. In 1961 the building was sold to Earlee Hotels, but the hotel continued to bear the name White Plaza until 1974. During these years the hotel began to deteriorate and decline in popularity. Restoration In 1977, Opal Sebastian, real estate investor, purchased the building and changed the name to the Plaza. All floors above the fourth level had been closed for an unknown period of time, and all rooms were in poor condition. Sebastian reopened the floors one at a time as they were rehabilitated. On February 15, 1985, the hotel was sold again to the Dallas Plaza Partners of California, made up of Hotel Equity Management and Blackmond, Garlock and Flynn real estate merchant banker of San Francisco. The Dallas Plaza Partners contracted with Corgan Architects Associates to restore the hotel and Jerry O'Hara to renovate the interior, which took ten months. In December 1985, The Dallas Plaza Hotel opened its doors. It was later renamed The Aristocrat Hotel of Dallas and managed by Holiday Inn. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Dallas Landmark in 1985. It was also designated as a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1988. Today In 2006, InterContinental Hotels Group, the parent company of Holiday Inn, converted the hotel to the Hotel Indigo Dallas Downtown.http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2006_1st/Mar06_IndigoDallas.html The property's interior underwent a $5 million renovation that introduced hardwood floors, spa-like guest bathrooms, a business center and an upgraded fitness area. Today the hotel contains of meeting space and 169 rooms.

North of the station, the double track branch line to Aliaƒüa splits from the main line. The original station was built in 1866 by the Smyrna Cassaba Railway. History The station was opened in 1866, by the Smyrna Cassaba Railway (SCP). A passenger train from Basmane Terminal in ƒ∞zmir served the station to Bandƒ±rma and U≈üak, then Afyon. The Republic of Turkey was formed in 1923 and the Turkish State Railways (TCDD) were formed in 1927 to nationalize Turkey's railways. SCP was absorbed by TCDD on June 1, 1934. TCDD rebuilt the station and broadened the tracks in 1938. The line was made double track in 1975 and electrified with 25 kV AC overhead wire in 2002. From 2006 to 2010 the Basmane-Ulukent section of the line in ƒ∞zmir was closed, due to the construction of the Kar≈üƒ±yaka Railway Tunnel. During this time the tracks in the station were used as a yard for passenger trains. When the line re-opened on May 19, 2010, the station was no longer used as a yard.

Water is not abstracted directly from the tarn, but flows some distance downriver to an off-take weir. On the slopes of Brim Fell, above the head of the reservoir, are the remains of Seathwaite Tarn Mine. This was worked for copper in the mid 19th century, and also appears as a location in the novel The Plague Dogs by Richard Adams. Rocks in the area were the first confirmed occurrence of wittichenite in the British Isles. Bronze Age ring cairns were found close to Seathwaite Tarn in 2003, these were excavated in 2003 and 2007. Seathwaite Tarn has suffered from acidification. An experiment in 1992‚Äì1993 to reduce the acidification by using a phosphorus- based fertiliser increased the pH from 5.1 to 5.6 and changed the levels of the different species of the rotifer assemblage significantly.  Repair and reconstruction  A statutory inspection was completed by the All Reservoir Panel Engineer in January 2007 during which the Panel Engineer recommended that works be carried out to the concrete face of the dam and that additional measures be implemented to prevent further deterioration of the concrete. Following this recommendation, United Utilities commissioned MWH to undertake works to improve the condition of the existing concrete dams and to help to implement recommendations to ensure that the reservoir would meet the requirements for a Category A reservoir. Work began in 2010, when the downstream face of the main dam was cleaned and loose concrete, efflorescence and other surface deposits were removed. The concrete face was then protected from further deterioration by using a cementitious repair mortar and siloxane waterproofer. The remedial works on the upstream face included the installation of a PVC geocomposite membrane, geonet drainage layer and associated drainage system to the upstream face of the main dam and the auxiliary overflow. The geomembrane is sealed on the concrete face along the foundation line and on the parapet wall 300 mm above the crest level to cover the joint between the upstream face and the parapet wall. The geomembrane covers a total surface area of 1,100m2. A Geomembrane drainage system was incorporated into the design to discharge water through 3 holes in the dam. Joints and cracks in the concrete were treated with an acrylic resin where the perimeter seal crosses the joint to prevent reservoir water bypassing the perimeter seal. A reinforced concrete wave wall was constructed to the same dimensions and levels as the existing but it extended into the high ground at the left and right ends of the dam. Finally, riprap erosion protection was laid at the left hand end of the dam to arrest erosion of the embankment. The material for the erosion protection was sourced from the reservoir basin.

The Componium, invented in 1821 by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel is an orchestrion with a random mechanism, created to play endless variations on a theme. The componium is a mechanical musical instrument constructed in 1821 by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel (Lippstatt, Germany, 1773 - Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1826) that composes novel music. It is an automatic organ consisting of two barrels that revolve simultaneously. The barrels take turns performing two measures of randomly chosen music while the other, silent, slides horizontally to select the next variation. A roulette- like flywheel chooses whether or not the next variation is selected. The instrument plays an 80 measure piece, with eight variations for every two measures. The componium's compositional power is thus limited to new combinations of the music provided in its barrels. This instrument is believed to have copied some features of Johann Nepomuk M√§lzels panharmonicon, but added the aleatoric composition feature. The componium, in a rather bad shape now, is in the collection of the Brussels Museum of Instruments.

Wallabout is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn that dates back to the 17th century. It is one of the oldest areas of Brooklyn, in the area that was once Wallabout Bay but has largely been filled in and is now the Brooklyn Navy Yard. It is a mixed use area with an array of old wood frame buildings, public housing, brick townhouses and warehouses. It is bounded by Navy Street to the west, the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Flushing Avenue to the north, Myrtle Avenue to the south and Marcy Avenue to the east. In the early 1800s, however, Wallabout was just a village inside of the town of Brooklyn. The Brooklyn we know today was divided up into six towns: Brooklyn, Gravesend, Flatlands, Flatbush, New Utrect, and Bushwick. Wallabout was one of the villages in the town of Brooklyn, bordering other villages in Brooklyn, like Bedford and Gowanus. But over time as Brooklyn became more industrialized, the borders shrank, and Wallabout was fitted just outside the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The Lefferts-Laidlaw House was built about 1840 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The Wallabout Historic District was added in 2011 and the Wallabout Industrial Historic District in 2012. Wallabout includes four public housing projects: The Marcy Houses, The Raymond V. Ingersoll Houses, the Walt Whitman Houses and the Farragut Houses. The neighborhood's name is rarely used anymore, being split into Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, and Bedford Stuyvesant.

It turns out that the study of these equations is also of great importance in physics and engineering, since equations of this type govern the physics of inhomogeneous or heterogeneous materials. Of course, all matter is inhomogeneous at some scale, but frequently it is convenient to treat it as homogeneous. A good example is the continuum concept which is used in continuum mechanics. Under this assumption, materials such as fluids, solids, etc. can be treated as homogeneous materials and associated with these materials are material properties such as shear modulus, elastic moduli, etc. Frequently, inhomogeneous materials (such as composite materials) possess microstructure and therefore they are subjected to loads or forcings which vary on a lengthscale which is far bigger than the characteristic lengthscale of the microstructure. In this situation, one can often replace the equation above with an equation of the form : abla\\\\cdot\\\\left(A^* abla u\\\\right) = f where A^* is a constant tensor coefficient and is known as the effective property associated with the material in question. It can be explicitly computed as : A^*_{ij}=\\\\int_{(0,1)^n} A(\\\\vec y)\\\\left( abla w_j(\\\\vec y)+\\\\vec e_j\\\\right) \\\\cdot\\\\vec e_i\\\\, dy_1\\\\dots dy_n , \\\\qquad i,j=1,\\\\dots,n from 1-periodic functions w_j satisfying: : abla_y\\\\cdot\\\\left(A(\\\\vec y) abla w_j\\\\right)= - abla_y\\\\cdot\\\\left(A(\\\\vec y)\\\\vec e_j\\\\right). This process of replacing an equation with a highly oscillatory coefficient with one with a homogeneous (uniform) coefficient is known as homogenization. This subject is inextricably linked with the subject of micromechanics for this very reason. In homogenization one equation is replaced by another if u_\\\\epsilon\\\\approx u for small enough \\\\epsilon, provided u_\\\\epsilon\\\\to u in some appropriate norm as \\\\epsilon\\\\to 0. As a result of the above, homogenization can therefore be viewed as an extension of the continuum concept to materials which possess microstructure. The analogue of the differential element in the continuum concept (which contains enough atom, or molecular structure to be representative of that material), is known as the \\"Representative Volume Element\\" in homogenization and micromechanics. This element contains enough statistical information about the inhomogeneous medium in order to be representative of the material. Therefore averaging over this element gives an effective property such as A^* above. Classical results of homogenization theory were obtained for media with periodic microstructure modeled by partial differential equations with periodic coefficients. These results were later generalized to spatially homogeneous random media modeled by differential equations with random coefficients which statistical properties are the same at every point in space. (English transl.: Math. USSR, Sb. 37:2, 1980, pp. 167-180) In practice, many applications require a more general way of modeling that is neither periodic nor statistically homogeneous. For this end the methods of the homogenization theory have been extended to partial differential equations, which coefficients are neither periodic nor statistically homogeneous (so-called arbitrarily rough coefficients).  The method of asymptotic homogenization  Mathematical homogenization theory dates back to the French, Russian and Italian schools. The method of asymptotic homogenization proceeds by introducing the fast variable \\\\vec y=\\\\vec x/\\\\epsilon and posing a formal expansion in \\\\epsilon: : u_\\\\epsilon(\\\\vec x) = u(\\\\vec x,\\\\vec y) = u_0(\\\\vec x,\\\\vec y)+ \\\\epsilon u_1(\\\\vec x,\\\\vec y)+\\\\epsilon^2 u_2(\\\\vec x,\\\\vec y)+O(\\\\epsilon^3)\\\\, which generates a hierarchy of problems. The homogenized equation is obtained and the effective coefficients are determined by solving the so-called \\"cell problems\\" for the function u_1(\\\\vec x,\\\\vec x/\\\\epsilon).

Jyoti ignores Deepak until he impresses her with a song, where she is impressed and the two fall in love. The couple marry and Deepak starts to search for a job as an architect. He gets the job and becomes an architect. His friend, Madan works in a bank. Pradeep Singh (Kiran Kumar) is a rich man, who has an account in Madan's bank. He has to go abroad, so he gives Rs. 25 Lakhs (2.5 Million) to Madan and tells him that he can give him the money back after five years. Deepak offers Madan to use the money and improve his life, but Madan refuses, so Deepak takes the money himself and buys himself and Jyoti, a big bungalow. The two go to a casino, where Deepak wins much money. They decide to play a bigger game, where Deepak and Jyoti lose more money. A rich businessman named Prakash (Sumeet Saigal) offers Jyoti to play for him and she wins. Prakash and Deepak make friends and he invites them to his birthday, where he sings a song for them. Deepak and Prakash are playing snooker, where Deepak tells Prakash about his problem until Prakash offers Deepak to give him money, if Jyoti sleeps with him for one night. Deepak sells the bungalow to a dealer. On his way back to home, he sits in a taxi, where the taxi driver and some of his friends fight Deepak and snatch his money. He goes back home at night and he tells Jyoti about the incident. At morning, when Deepak wakes up, Jyoti is not at home. Jyoti goes to Prakash who flips a coin - the outcome of which decides whether Jyoti will sleep with him or not. When Jyoti returns to home, Deepak asks her where she had gone.

It is about long, and along with its major tributary, Trabuco Creek, drains near the southernmost extent of Orange County. This article describes the course of San Juan Creek. Headwaters to San Juan Canyon San Juan Creek begins in the southern Santa Ana Mountains, a few miles northwest of Lake Elsinore. Its highest elevation is above sea level. Paralleling the Ortega Highway (California State Route 74) the creek flows erratically south, west and occasionally northwest. In the furthest upper reaches of the watershed, the creek is typically ephemeral. The creek channel in the uppermost few miles is a narrow mountain stream with many rapids and waterfalls, which include a series of large cascades, known as San Juan Falls.Shaffer, Chris. The Definitive Guide to the Waterfalls of Southern and Central California. Shafdog Publications, 2005. pp. 379‚Äì380. There are little alluvial deposits in the canyons, and the creek mostly cascades over bedrock. In this upper reach, the pool-and-riffle stream channel structure is evident. There are a few developments within the area, but most of the canyon is too narrow for development, and the only major structure that influences the creek throughout San Juan Canyon is Ortega Highway, which follows the course of the entire canyon. San Juan Canyon viewed from Ortega Highway Leaving its uppermost headwaters, San Juan Creek flows south and west in several meanders, then finally proceeds to flow west-southwest. It is joined by the ephemeral watercourses Long Canyon and Morell Canyon on the right bank, and Bear Canyon on the left bank. At about this reach, it plunges over San Juan Falls, a drop; the falls is preceded by a short cascade and followed by a series of near-vertical falls. In this reach, stream pools, which tend to become stagnant during low flow periods, are abundant. Continuing on down the gradually widening valley, San Juan Creek turns westwards and drops over several more falls, before finally widening to about . Just below the falls, a small perennial watercourse trickles into San Juan Creek on the left bank. About below the falls, deposits begin to become apparent on the floor of the widening valley, and the creek spreads out, with short reaches of cascades between slackwater pools and more gradual courses. After flowing through this approximately valley, it narrows again to a steep canyon, receiving Lion Canyon on the right bank. It is crossed by the first major bridge, a stone arch bridge carrying Ortega Highway. After the bridge, the creek is joined by Hot Springs Creek on the right bank, which is fed by the San Juan Hot Springs; Cold Springs Creek meets San Juan Creek only about downstream, also on the right bank. About past Cold Springs Creek, Lucas Canyon Creek joins on the left bank. San Juan Canyon to San Juan Capistrano After San Juan Creek exits San Juan Canyon, it spreads to a braided channel over extensive alluvial deposits on the floor of its valley. The width of the channel can range from , and water flow is usually subsurface in the dry season. Agriculture and ranching are the primary land use in the middle reach. The creek bed meanders in large arcs, separated by numerous islands and bands of vegetation. At the beginning of this wider valley, Lucas Canyon Creek enters on the left bank. A few miles past this confluence, San Juan Creek receives the second largest tributary, south-flowing Bell Canyon, on the right bank, at almost the same point that Verdugo Canyon enters the creek on the opposite bank. Bell Canyon receives pollution from several residential communities that overlook, but do not border, it. The creek bends to the northwest, where it meets Trampas Canyon on the left bank. Shortly after Trampas Canyon, the third largest tributary, Ca√±ada Gobernadora, enters on the right bank, along with Ca√±ada Chiquita, after Gobernadora. The creek bends south again, passing an elementary school on its left bank. About downstream of Bell Canyon and downstream of San Juan Canyon, San Juan Creek enters heavily urban landscape in the city limits of San Juan Capistrano, from where it is channelized for the rest of its length. In the reach between San Juan Canyon and the city, San Juan Creek is not channelized, but does have some modifications along its length. The Ortega Highway crosses the creek twice in this section, and notably at the first bridge, the creek channel is narrowed from to . An access road crosses San Juan Creek near where it meets Bell Canyon, and at this point, the creek is diverted into culverts. There are also gabions along San Juan Creek for some of its length, mainly preceding, at and after stream crossings. There are also two objects that form drops, but not impoundments, in the middle reach, one man-made and one natural. The man-made structure is a small gabion located at the entrance of Caspers Wilderness Park, which is near the west boundary of the Cleveland National Forest. The second is a natural sandstone outcropping below a bridge. The former is beginning to lose its original use and may be washed out by one large flood. Trabuco Creek to mouth San Juan Creek flows through a flood control channel for its lower . The lowermost reach of San Juan Creek begins after it crosses underneath Interstate 5. After passing beneath the interstate, it is abruptly diverted into a trapezoidal flood control channel, with concrete levees and an earthen riverbed. The creek flows southwest, arcing gradually south, and very soon receives the underground discharge of El Horno Creek on the right bank. A few hundred yards past El Horno, San Juan Creek receives its largest tributary, Trabuco Creek, on the right bank. Trabuco Creek begins in the northeastern corner of the watershed and drains most of the watershed's north half. It flows primarily west then south-southwest, through a valley that is generally more developed than that of the mainstem. For much of its lower third, it winds alongside Interstate 5. At river mile 4 (river kilometer 6.4) it receives its major tributary, Oso Creek, on its right bank. In its final course, it flows into a south-flowing flood control channel that meets San Juan Creek inside San Juan Capistrano. After the confluence with Trabuco Creek, San Juan Creek flows more or less directly south for about , bending only once, slightly to the southeast, for this entire reach. The channel in cross-section is about wide and deep, with a bicycle path running along the west side. The creek crosses the boundary between San Juan Capistrano and the city of Dana Point, where its channel widens and further shallows. It is crossed by Camino Las Ramblas on a high bridge, then finally crossed by the Pacific Coast Highway on two lower bridges. Directly after this final crossing, San Juan Creek flows into a fresh-water lagoon south of the north end of Doheny State Beach, created by a tongue of sand that blocks the water from reaching the ocean. At its maximum extent, the lagoon forms a small lake that extends beneath the highway. Occasionally, the sand berm impounding the water is breached, causing massive runoff into the ocean. Despite the almost constant blockage of San Juan Creek here, it has been said that subsurface outflow also occurs through the sandspit; this means that Doheny State Beach and Capistrano Bay receive pollution from the creek almost constantly.

He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2014, and also played for the Seattle Mariners. Prior to his professional career, Rasmussen attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and played college baseball for the UCLA Bruins. Early life Rasmussen is a native of Arcadia, California. He attended Clairbourn School and then Polytechnic School in Pasadena, California. He established himself as an elite high school prospect despite attending a small high school with only 360 students. As a four-year starter for the varsity baseball team at Polytechnic, Rasmussen compiled a 38‚Äì2 record and 1.04 ERA, recording 492 strikeouts in 248 innings over his career. Rasmussen earned further attention from professional and collegiate baseball scouts while playing in the Babe Ruth League between high school seasons, pitching for three Babe Ruth World Series championship teams and posting a 17‚Äì0 record. Collegiate career After being selected in the 27th round of the 2007 MLB Draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers, Rasmussen decided to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to play college baseball for the UCLA Bruins. In his first season at UCLA, Rasmussen made only 10 appearances and 2 starts after sustaining a broken left foot off a line drive comebacker in the third inning of his 2008 collegiate debut against UC Santa Barbara. After recovering from his injury at the end of the 2008 season, Rasmussen finished with a 5.60 ERA and 0-2 record in 17 innings. Rasmussen started for UCLA in the NCAA Regional Final against Cal State Fullerton. Rasmussen at the 2009 Cape Cod All Star Game During the summers of 2008 and 2009, Rasmussen pitched for the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League.http://www.orleanscardinals.com/Statistics.html After going 2-0 with a 0.96 ERA in his first three starts for the Orleans Firebirds in the summer of 2009, Rasmussen was selected to start on the mound in the Cape Cod League All- Star game at Fenway Park on July 23, 2009. He finished the Cape Cod season going 4-0 with a 1.80 ERA. During the 2009 season, Rasmussen made 18 appearances, posted a record of 4-2 with a 6.75 ERA, while totaling 51 strikeouts and 26 walks in 44 innings.

The team went on to play in the 2010 College World Series and was defeated by South Carolina in the NCAA Championship Series. Rasmussen went 11-3 with a 2.72 ERA, collecting 128 strikeouts in 109 innings. According to the Under Armour 2010 Draft Scouting Report: \\"Rasmussen is a pretty advanced college lefty with an interesting combination of pitchability and stuff. He has four pitches he's around the plate with, though he does need to be a little more efficient with his pitches. He's a bit undersized, which might concern some, but he does a nice job mixing his pitches and keeping hitters guessing. If the spike in velocity he showed early in the spring is still around all season, he could sneak even further up Draft boards.\\" Professional career =Miami Marlins= Los Angeles Dodgers in 2013 spring training On June 8, 2010, Rasmussen was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the second round of the MLB Draft. On July 7, 2010, he officially signed his first pro contract with the Marlins. He made his debut for Class-A Greensboro (South Atlantic League).

The 8x8 version of the VBTP-MR is the base of Iveco's Superav armoured personnel carrier. In the program other Brazilian Companies also participated, such as IMBEL (Communications), ELBIT (Armaments), Usiminas and (development of national ballistic structural steel). History In 1999 the Brazilian Army issued a request (ROB #09/99) for a new family of armored fighting vehicles with amphibious capabilities able to replace the EE-9 Cascavel and EE-11 Urutu developed in the seventies. The main feature of this new family should be its modular design, allowing the incorporation of different turrets, weapons, sensors and communications systems onto the same carriage. The development program also include a communications version, an ambulance version and different fire support versions, armed with large calibre mortar and gun systems. The Brazilian Army has signed with Iveco a contract worth about ‚Ç¨2.5 billion for supplying armoured personnel carriers of the VBTP-MR model. The vehicles will replace the old Urutu armoured vehicle employed today by the Brazilian armed forces. The contract covers the delivery of 2,044 vehicles and logistical support for a period of 20 years. Deliveries are expected to begin in 2012, and continue for 18 years. There is also an 8√ó8 variant of the vehicle. Versions Currently, the VBTP-MR comes in different variants and versions: 300px * VBTP Standard; * VBCI (with 30mm turret); * VBE / CP (command post); * VBE / Mort (mortar carrier, possibly 120mm); * VBE / Recon (105 mm cannon) * VBE / CDT (fire control); * VBE / Communications / Command and Control; * VBE / Workshop; * VBE / Relief; * VBTE / Ambulance The requirements for the VBTP-MR VBCI included an ELBIT remote control turret, equipped with a Mk44 Bushmaster II cannon and a 7.62mm machine gun; it should also be able fire anti-tank guided missiles. This turret, capable of 360 degree swivel and elevation / depression of -15 to +60 degrees, was chosen by the Brazilian Army on a selection made from among four companies. It is expected to be manufactured in Brazil. The firing system has a laser rangefinder, vision and fire control by day/night thermal vision, double shot of command (commander and gunner of the car, with precedence for the later), automatic target tracking system, and hunter killer smoke launchers. A significant aspect of this vehicle is that the turret is equipped with weapons sights and it is stabilized in two axes, allowing firing on the move with very high probability of hit within the first shot. Future needs will determine what kind of instruments will equip the turret, possibly after the vehicle enters service. Some speculate that the VBE / CP version will fashion a battle management system. The first level at which information must flow in a bidirectional way, what is known as \\"situational awareness\\", refers to the tactical commander. The distress (probably the VBCI) and reconnaissance models are planned to have an 8√ó8 drive train.

(.50 machine gun) * possibly a 120 mm mortar (mortar version) * possibly a 105 mm cannon (reconnaissance version) Export Compared to the model in use today by the Brazilian Army, the new project brings advantages such as upgraded armor protection, increased mobility, increased range, independent hydropneumatic suspension, increased protection against mines, better ergonomics, air conditioning, brake system with double disc and ABS, GPS, automatic detection and extinguishing of fire, night operation capability as standard and laser detection system. According to Waldemir Cristino General Romulo, Military Project Manager, there is an interest in exporting the VBTP-MR to other markets, because Brazil has already sold vehicles to Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific in the past. The Argentine Army expressed interest in an 8√ó8 version. Armies also from Chile, Colombia and Ecuador showed interest in the Guarani. =First orders= 200px On the 26 November 2009, the Brazilian Defence Minister, Nelson Jobim, announced that President Lula had authorized the start of production for 2044 new vehicles with the new name Guarani, formerly known as Urutu III. According to him the new vehicle would replace the entire mobility system of the Brazilian Army. Also according to the minister, $6 billion would be invested in construction for the Guarani over 20 years. It was predicted that the first vehicle would be ready in 2010 and 16 vehicles would be tested by 2011. From 2012 on, the actual production would begin. The army commander, General Enzo Martins Peri, signed the contract for the manufacture of vehicles on 18 December 2009. The examinations would be held at Army's test range (CAEx), located in Barra de Guaratiba, west of Rio de Janeiro state. The tests would examine the vehicle durability, ergonomics and armour in situation such as landmine explosions, Only on 7 August 2012, the Brazilian Army signed a contract to produce 86 Guarani. The order was completed by December 2012. In March 2014 the 33rd Motorized Infantry Battalion of the 15th Mechanized Infantry Brigade will receive the first 13 vehicles. It will be the first regular army unit to be issued the new vehicle. It will be part of trials using the initial 86 vehicles to figure out doctrine for its use in service.

Seale is a federal criminal case in the United States, in which Ku Klux Klan member James Ford Seale was prosecuted and convicted for his role in the racially motivated murders in 1964 of two black teens. The case was procedurally unusual in that it was initiated in 2007, and it was unclear whether the statute of limitations had expired due to revision of the governing criminal statute in the interim. The trial court ruled against Seale on the issue, which was affirmed by an evenly divided appellate court. The appellate court then took the highly unusual step of seeking certification of the legal question to the Supreme Court of the United States, seeking guidance on whether the revisions retroactively changed the applicable limitations period. The Supreme Court dismissed the certification without comment. Background The case has its beginnings in the 1964 kidnapping of two black teenagers. After they had been beaten, they had weights attached and were thrown into the Mississippi River to drown. After an investigation, James Ford Seale and another man, allegedly members of the Ku Klux Klan, were indicted for the murder. The charges were dropped because, it was later alleged, the police were colluding with the Klan. Nevertheless, the House Committee on Un- American Activities called Seale to testify and placed its belief that he had committed the crime in its records. Seale then dropped off the radar, and was thought dead until 2005. In 2007, he was indicted by the federal government for the crime. The case and the timeliness issue The federal kidnapping statute doesn't specify a time limit on prosecutions, so the general limits of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 3281 and 3282 supply the time limit on prosecution, if there is any. There is no time limit on a capital crime (section 3281), but non-capital crimes are subject to a five-year statute of limitations (section 3282). Seale moved to dismiss the indictment on the theory that the latter applied to him. Although kidnapping was a capital offense in 1964, Congress detached the death penalty from it in the mid-1970s in response to United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570 (1968), and Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972). This should be given retroactive effect, Seale contended, making his offense subject to section 3282's five year limit, and the indictment accordingly untimely. The district court rejected this argument. The case proceeded to trial, the jury found Seale guilty on all counts (helped, no doubt, by an FBI agent's testimony that Seale had admitted the crime after his arrest ), and three life sentences ensued. On appeal, Seale raised seven issues, but a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decided only one of them. It embraced Seale's argument that the prosecution was time-barred; because that decision terminated the case, the panel did not address the remaining issues. The full Fifth Circuit agreed to hear the case en banc, vacating the panel's decision. Although the en banc court decided to hear the case, however, it could not decide how to decide the case, dividing nine to nine. The upshot was that the panel opinion was vacated, and the district court's denial of Seale's motion was nominally affirmed without opinion. The case was remanded to the panel for consideration of the remaining six issues raised on appeal. Rather than await the panel's decision or appeal, Seale asked the Fifth Circuit to invoke a rarely used procedure. 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1254(2) and Supreme Court Rule 19 allow a federal court of appeals to certify a question to the Supreme Court, bypassing (to an extent) the usual appellate process. The procedure is not commonly used; only four cases certified have been accepted by the court in more than sixty years,Order certifying a question to the Supreme Court in United States v. Seale, no. 07-60732, at 9 (5th Cir., Jul 30 2009) (Jones, C.J., dissenting). the last one in 1981. Nevertheless, on Seale's motion, a majority of the Fifth Circuit agreed to certify the question of whether section 3281 or 3282 is controlling for a kidnapping that occurred in 1964. Judge Harold DeMoss, writing for the majority,The panel's certification opinion was designated as being a per curiam, but Chief Judge Jones' dissent identifies Judge DeMoss as the author. premised certification both on the unusual posture of the particular case and its implications for the broader considerations at issue, noting that the government is investigating several other cases from the 1960s that may raise the same question of time limits.See also ; (noting that in 2007, Congress \\"authorize[d] up to $13.5 million a year in new federal spending for investigations into 'cold case' killings\\"). Writing for the four dissenters, Chief Judge Edith Jones noted that the Supreme Court was unlikely to take the case, that the Department of Justice had not made it clear that other cases involving the same question are in the pipeline, as the majority had contended, and that certification was inappropriate when the panel might dispose of the case on other grounds on remand. It is in the discretion of the Supreme Court to answer certified questions or not. The court has indicated that such actions are disfavored, and it has rarely taken such cases, but such cases have been taken before.Justice Stevens, in his separate opinion, noted that the Supreme Court had not accepted a certified question since 1981. [ United States v. Seale], 558 U.S. ___ (2009) (Stevens, J.). Supreme Court dismissal The Supreme Court dismissed the certified question on November 2, 2009. In a statement respecting the dismissal joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote: The case will now return to the District Court for consideration of the residuum of issues, per the Fifth Circuit's original en banc decision.

He remains the current world record holder partly because the event has not been run frequently by elite athletes since the early 1960s. Hurdler Don Styron was an identical twin, his younger brother (by 24 minutes) being David Styron (a sprinter). The brothers only had come to Colorado from southeast Kansas in 1955. During the depression, the boys lived on a farm without electricity or running water until seventh grade. They would race each other home from their one room schoolhouse. The move to Denver was a major social change. First they went to North High School where they were victims of a fight every day. The brothers demanded a change. Them went west down 32nd Avenue to Wheat Ridge High School where they ran for track coach, Lew Hartzog. With points from the twins in multiple events, Wheat Ridge dominated local competition. After their graduation in 1957, Hartzog took a job establishing a new track program at Northeast Louisiana State College. Hartzog went back to recruit his former star athletes, finding them bailing hay in Wyoming. When they arrived in Monroe, Louisiana, they had to work out at a local high school. They had to help build their own track. Early on, David set the American Junior record in the 100 yard dash at 9.4.http://www.denverpost.com/2008/07/21/styron-twins-supply-louisiana- lightning/ Both brothers were inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1977. The record On April 2, 1960, in a dual meet against Louisiana State University, the 20-year-old hurdler ran a time of 21.9 for the straight 220 yard low hurdles‚Äîwhich is slightly longer (201.2 meters) than the metric distance recognized worldwide. That time has not been surpassed since. 1960 is the last year the IAAF recognized the world record in the 200 meter low hurdles. The 220 yard Low Hurdles is one of the four events Jesse Owens set or tied World Records in during a 45 minute span on May 25, 1935‚Äîwhat many people have regarded as the greatest sports achievement. The previous mark of 22.5 was held by Karl Martin Lauer, the German Olympic hurdler, over the metric distance. As were all marks from that era, it was recorded by three hand stopwatches, as opposed to today's Fully Automatic Timing (FAT). The fastest FAT time recorded is now 22.30 (with a wind of -0.6 mps) set on May 16, 2010 by Andy Turner set at the Manchester City Games in a specially arranged race, but using standard conversion, Styron's mark is still superior. Turner beat a time by Olympian Laurent Ottoz of Italy in 1995. Ottoz had bettered the automatic time of 22.63 by British Olympic medalist and multi-time World Champion Colin Jackson, who held the world record in the much more common 110 metre hurdles for almost 13 years.http://www.woodhurdles.com/200meterLowHurdles/1.html WoodHurdles record progression Two weeks after the 21.9, Styron ran 22.2 in Abilene, a week later a 22.3 in Baton Rouge, two more weeks later a 22.2 in Natchitoches, a week after that 22.3 in Lake Charles, then a 22.1 at the Modesto Relays, equal to the #2 time ever recorded by Elias Gilbert without a wind gauge. Styron's run had wind gauge recording he ran into a headwind, -0.9 mps. A year later he equaled that performance at the same track. In all, Styron holds 9 of the top 18 hand times recorded during that era. Two other people making that top list finished second to Styron, both were Olympic medalists, Dick Howard and Irvin Roberson.http://www.alltime-athletics.com/m_200hok.htm Styron did not get the opportunity to run for the NCAA Championship, 1959 was the last year the event was held. Traditionally, the event was not held in Olympic years. The achievement merited Styron an appearance in the April 18, 1960 issue of Sports Illustrated as one of the \\"Faces in the Crowd.\\" That year he was also ranked in the top 5 hurdlers in both the 110 Hurdles and 400 Hurdles, one of the few individuals to achieve such ranking simultaneously.http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/rankings/men/400husranking.pdf 400 Hurdles annual rankingshttp://www.trackandfieldnews.com/rankings/men/110husranking.pdf Track and Field News 110 Hurdles annual rankings Styron finished 6th in the 400 meter hurdles at the 1960 Olympic Trials. He remained a nationally ranked hurdler until 1962, tying the American record in the indoor 60 yard hurdles at 7.0.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1073512/3/index.htm Sports Illustrated In 1962 he was rated as the best all around hurdler.http://onceuponatimeinthevest.blogspot.com/2012/06/march-1962-and- introducing-brief.html Don's best chance of qualifying was in 1964, but without money, he had to hitchhike from Los Angeles to New Brunswick, New Jersey for the semi-Olympic Trials.

It was incorporated on July 26, 1906, in Oregon, and completed the line on June 12, 1910. From opening, the company's line, and a steamboat it had acquired, were leased to the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company (OR&N;). The OR&N; was already operating a line through Manito to Spokane (built by the Washington and Idaho Railroad), and at Amwaco it used the steamboat to cross Lake Coeur d'Alene to Harrison, which was located on another ex-Washington and Idaho Railroad line to Wallace.

Formerly the National Strategic Fraud Authority, it was set up in October 2008 in response to the government's Fraud Review in 2006. It concluded that fraud was a significantly under-reported crime, and while various agencies and organisations were attempting to tackle the issue, greater co-operation was needed to achieve a real impact within the public sector. The scale of the problem pointed to the need to bring together the numerous counter-fraud initiatives that existed, which is when the NFA was formed. The Chief Executive was Stephen Harrison.http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/nfa/about- us/biographies/executives/ The Home Secretary Theresa May announced in December 2013 that the NFA would be closed on 31 March 2014. Strategic development and threat analysis was transferred to the National Crime Agency, Action Fraud was transferred to the City of London Police, the e-confidence campaign transferred to the Home Office and responsibility for the development of the Counter-fraud Checking Service was taken on by the Cabinet Office. Functions The NFA works to tackle frauds across the spectrum, but also works on fraud types and fraud issues that are a notable problem. These include identity fraud, mortgage fraud, accommodation addresses, mass marketing fraud and fraud affecting small- and medium-sized businesses. The NFA also produces the Annual Fraud Indicator, which estimates the cost of fraud. The last estimate made put the cost of fraud to the UK at ¬£52 billion a year. Working with the charity, Victim Support, the NFA has also done some significant work with victims, to ensure they receive the support they deserve if they have been a victim of the crime. Action Fraud Action Fraud is the UK's national fraud reporting service, run by a private sector company for the NFA. Action Fraud is the place to go to get information and advice about fraud, as well as to report fraud. UK citizens can report fraud online (such as forwarding scam emails for inspection) or by telephone. When a fraud is reported to Action Fraud, victims are given a crime reference number and their case is passed on to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB), which is run by the City of London's police service. The Action Fraud website also has an A-Z of fraud describing different types of fraud, and offers prevention advice. As of November 2014, there were 85 call-handling staff employed by the Action Fraud helpline. Annual Fraud Indicator The NFA publishes the Annual Fraud Indicator every year, which is the UK's comprehensive estimate of how much fraud costs the UK. The annual fraud indicator for 2012 was published in March 2012, and estimated that fraud would cost the UK over ¬£73 billion that year. This was up from ¬£38 billion in 2011. When broken down by sector, the indicator revealed that fraud losses to the public sector amounted to ¬£20.3 billion, the private sector lost ¬£45.5 billion, the not-for-profit sector lost ¬£1.1 billion and individuals lost ¬£6.1 billion. Fraud in the Public Sector The NFA's 'Fraud in the Public Sector action plan' places a firm emphasis on enhanced measures to prevent fraud in central and local government. This has been broken down into 15 workstreams.

Most people who hold themselves out as prison consultants are ex-convicts who, by the nature of their background, are considered to be disreputable. Most prison consultants are sole-practitioners, giving cause for further skepticism. The Federal Bureau of Prisons takes no position on consulting. Additional advice In general, consultants will advise prison-bound clients to keep a low profile and avoid offending other inmates. Offenses can include joining a conversation without an invitation, asking personal questions without a proper cue, and taking liberties with the television (most fights take place in the TV room).Prison Consultants Help Inmates Get Good Digs, New York Times, July 28, 2009 Consultants can help navigate early-release programs and will recommend entry into a drug or alcohol rehab program. Federal prison consultants often educate clients regarding the Residential Drug Abuse Program, a 500 hour program which can reduce a federal sentence up to 12 months., The Spokesman-Review, March 30, 2017 Consultants may advise about Federal Bureau of Prisons employee personality types; how to defend one's self in a prison fight; and how best to avoid being raped, stabbed or beaten. Clients are warned to expect strip searches and to accept a complete loss of personal control to the guards. Commentary on infamous inmates Much news and discussion of prison consultants has centered on Bernard Madoff. Herbert Hoelter, who advised Madoff, says that Madoff's sentencing to the medium-security Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, North Carolina is appropriate because the facility is next door to a medical center, and if Madoff becomes eligible for transfer to a low-security prison, there is one within the same complex. Hoelter expects that a number of his other clients in Butner will take Madoff under their wing, saying \\"It's like a buddy system.\\" He thinks Madoff's lengthy term \\"will give him credibility with other inmates.\\" His advice to Madoff was \\"It‚Äôs a matter of keeping your space and having respect for other people\\". However, Steven Oberfest of The Prison Coach says Madoff enters prison at a disadvantage because the other prisoners know everything about him from the media, but he knows nothing about them. Oberfest calls Butner \\"a general, nasty, medium-security-type prison\\" and says Madoff needs to be careful of other inmates who might be paid by those he defrauded to intimidate or harm him.Madoff‚Äôs Prison Consultant Weighs In On Inmate No. 61727-054, Wall Street Journal, July 15, 2009 Similarly, Larry Levine of Wall Street Prison Consultants expects that someone will make a payment to another inmate's family, a dining-hall distraction will be created, and Madoff will be stabbed.Fox Biz: How Madoff Will Be Killed In Jail, Fox Business, July 14, 2009 Hoelter says convicted child molester Jerry Sandusky \\"is in for a tough, tough ride\\". Unlike Madoff, who lives among his fellow prisoners, Sandusky will likely have to spend the rest of his life in solitary confinement for his own safety. A similar high-profile child sex offender, John Geoghan, was targeted and murdered by a fellow inmate in 2003. Levine noted the significant dangers in prison for sex offenders.Sandusky begins grim transition to prison, Detroit Free Press, October 7, 2012 See also * Prisoners' rights References External links * You've Got Jail by Jennifer Senior in New York Magazine, July 15, 2002 * Making Crime Pay by Matt Richtel in The New York Times, April 7, 2012 Category:Consulting occupations Category:Penal imprisonment ","title":"Prison consultant"},{"id":"23852758","text":"Real-time control system may refer to: * Real-time Control System (RCS), a reference model architecture, suitable for many software-intensive, real-time control problem domains  Real-time Control System Software, a software system developed by NIST based on the Real-time Control System Reference Model Architecture  4D-RCS Reference Model Architecture, an RCS application in the vehicle domain  ISAM Framework, an RCS application in the manufacturing domain  NASA/NBS Standard Reference Model for Telerobot Control Systems Architecture (NASREM), an RCS application in the space domain * Control engineering, an engineering field focusing on digital control systems and real-time systems * Embedded system, a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system  See also  * RCS (disambiguation) ","title":"Real-time control system"},{"id":"23852783","text":"Herbert Britton Gwyn in 1913 The Reverend Herbert Britton Gwyn (May 5, 1873 - March 26, 1934) was the editor of The Churchman, the New York weekly representing the Low Church faction of the Protestant Episcopal Church.

Mathematically, a property‚Äôs investment rating is the return a risk-free asset would have to yield to be termed as good an investment as the property whose rating is being calculated. The underlying drivers for property ratings are the dividends (net operating income) and capital gains over a certain holding period, and their associated risks or variances. Similar to other financial ratings developed for mutual funds and stocks, it can be assumed that investors have constant relative risk aversion over the wealth derived from other sources and from their investments. For simplicity, it can also be assumed that the investment return is not correlated with other sources of wealth but represents 100% of the investor's wealth. A property‚Äôs investment rating is then a transformation of the risk-adjusted averaged return to a single number that conveys the property‚Äôs long-term potential to yield profits. Home as an investment asset Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations over 200 years ago that \\"a dwelling-house, as such, contributes nothing to the revenue of its inhabitants\\". The Economist has reported that most Americans were treating their homes as an investment till 2008. The traditional belief that home ownership is a necessary milestone to acquiring wealth still holds. Not everyone considers their home as a long-term Property investment asset ; some believe they can get better returns in other assets . By owning a home to live in, the owner not only saves on rent but also benefits from any long-term price appreciation. And investors, those that buy a home to rent out, are in it primarily for financial gains, be it monthly cash flow income, long-term gain, or a combination of both. But, investors and live-in home owners alike should care for the net returns a home can yield, since it is, for most, the single largest investment they will ever make.  Rating evaluation Objective evaluation of a property's intrinsic long-term \\"worth\\", requires a rating process as mature as the process for stocks and funds. Knowing a property's current market price is necessary, but not sufficient, especially in uncertain times. There are hundreds of macro and micro factors that could potentially impact a property's financial returns, including price appreciation, ability to put it on rent, and vacancy, fair market value, mortgage, maintenance expenses, property tax, property management fee (if any), and home insurance. Add on top attributes that span markets, housing, government, community, demographic and lifestyle parameters. A sound rating analysis should cover all aspects of location ‚Äì national, state, metro, county, city, tracts down to neighborhoods and the property itself. One should be able to measure and factor in the inherent risk/volatility in all of these attributes to arrive at a measure that can be correlated to a financially sound decision on the next home purchase No one has a crystal ball, of course. So, any rating of this nature should be interpreted as a 'relative' measure, and used as a way to rank/compare homes for their relative investment potential. In other words, a highly rated home is likely to outperform a low- rated home. So, homes in the top quartile are most likely to outperform all other homes.

It was first unveiled at the 1992 MAKS Airshow as part of a marketing effort which resulted in China purchasing the weapon. Description The S3V is an aerially deployed weapon, with a parachute system detached at the moment of splashdown. The sonar mounted in the nose is activated upon entering the water, searching for hostile submarines. It directs its control surfaces to maneuver the depth charge toward the target once it is located and identified. The developer has claimed that the S3V is around 1.2 to 1.6 times more effective than conventional unguided depth charges in shallow water (‚â§ 200 meters) and around 4 to 8 times more effective in deep water (up to 600 meters).

LCAW is developed to fill the gap between conventional depth charge and torpedoes, in the area where depth charges lack propulsion and guidance, while the cost of expansive torpedoes are increasingly becoming prohibitive. The program initially begun in 1987, and completed in 1992. In 1993, the program was adopted by Germany and Norway for their low coast anti-submarine weaponry program when the weaponry proved to meet the German and Norwegian requirement of maximum underwater attack range of 500 m from the point of entry into the water. Norwegians subsequently developed their own upgraded variant. In addition to regular deployment, LCAW is also used by Italian naval special force. The air dropped version is deployed from aerial sonar buoy dispensers. The weapon is primarily designed to engage targets in shallow water, especially midget submarines, swimmer delivery vehicle, human torpedo and other special operation uses. Variant All of LCAW variants share the same operating depth, from 15 to 300 meters, and the same diameter, 123.8 mm. The same 2.5 kg PBX shaped charge warhead is adopted by air-launched variants while a tandem charge is shared by surface- launched variants. A total of five variants have been developed, including: *A200: The basic version with 883.4 mm, weighing 11.3 kg, with a range of 700 meters at 17 kt.

It was at one time one of six hotels catering to tourists using the Big Spring of Thermopolis, a hot spring reputed to possess curative properties. The hotel was erected by bricklayer James Callaghan, who obtained a 98-year lease on the site commencing on January 1, 1918. Callaghan made his own bricks in a kiln he built on the site, completing the Callaghan Apartments in June 1918. He employed several nurses and a masseur for his guests. In 1921 Callaghan sold the property to Dr. P.W. Metz who renamed it The Plaza. The two-story yellow brick building overlooks the Big Horn River and originally had 70 rooms with a common bathroom at the end of each hall. The baths were once provided with mineral water. The building is U-shaped in plan, facing east with a concrete foundation under the central portion and stone foundations under the wings. The exterior walls are capped and accented by red bricks in a soldier course. Two-story window bays are outlined in red brick soldiers, and bays are marked with decorative red brick arches. The building was divided into 14 hallways, each with a bath. A spa area was divided into men's and women's areas with soaking tubs and a steam sauna, using 127-degree water from the Big Spring. The hot water was piped in a loop under the Big Horn River to temper it for bathing. The Plaza was renovated in 1999 and remains a hotel.

Etymology The name comes from the French word for kettledrum (timbale). Varieties of Timballo differ from region to region, and it is sometimes known as a bomba, tortino, sartu (a Neapolitan interpretation) or pasticcio (which is used more commonly to refer to a similar dish baked in a pastry crust). It is also known as timpano and Timbale (food). It is similar to a casserole and is sometimes referred to in English as a pie or savory cake. Preparation The dish is prepared in a dome or springform pan and eggs or cheese are used as a binder. Rice is commonly used as an ingredient in Emilia-Romagna, where the dish is referred to as a bomba and baked with a filling of pigeon or other game bird, peas, local cheese and a base of dried pasta. Cr√™pes are used as a base in Abruzzo, and other regions use ravioli or gnocchi. In Sicily, it's typically made with pasta and eggplant. Mushroom sauce or fonduta, a rich Piedmontese cheese soup and sauce, are sometimes used, and Anna Del Conte wrote that B√©chamel is the most consistently used ingredient in timballos. In popular culture Timballo featured prominently in the 1996 film Big Night, although the dish there is referred to as timpano (a regional or family term).

Both systems can punish blasphemy. The Constitution provides a Customary (secular) system and a system that incorporates Sharia. The Customary system prohibits blasphemy by section 204 of Nigeria's Criminal Code. Section 204 is entitled \\"Insult to religion\\". The section states: : Any person who does an act which any class of persons consider as a public insult on their religion, with the intention that they should consider the act such an insult, and any person who does an unlawful act with the knowledge that any class of persons will consider it such an insult, is guilty of a misdemeanour, and is liable to imprisonment for two years. Twelve out of Nigeria's thirty-six states have Sunni Islam as the dominant religion. In 1999, those states chose to have Sharia courts as well as Customary courts. A Sharia court may treat blasphemy as deserving of several punishments up to, and including, execution.http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&id;=4FBA416ABC8805C2802569A600603109 Amnesty International Report on Saudi Arabia 2007. Amnesty International Report on Saudi Arabia 2009. The Constitution The prohibition against blasphemy in the Criminal Code and the prohibition recognized by Sharia may not be lawful because Section 38 of the Constitution entitles every Nigerian to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, and Section 39 gives every Nigerian the right to freedom of expression. Law enforcement The system of law enforcement in Nigeria is beset by a lack of resources, sectarian loyalties, and corruption. As a consequence, vigilantism often goes unpunished. Vigilantism frequently occurs after an accusation of blasphemy (See below.). Selected cases On 10 August 2020, a Kano state Shariah Court sentenced two people: * Yahaya Sharif (22 years old) was sentenced to death by hanging for the offence of blasphemy against the prophet. He was accused of having blasphemed in his song which he circulated on WhatsApp in March of 2020. Following this incident, his family home was burnt down. * Omar Farouq (13 years old) was sentenced to 10 years in prison for blasphemy. His lawyer appealed on September 7, saying that his sentence violated the African Charter of the Rights and Welfare of a Child and the Nigerian constitution. On 19 June 2009, a Muslim mob in the town of Sara in Jigawa state burned a police outpost and injured about twelve people over an alleged blasphemy against the Islamic prophet Mohammed. The mob complained that someone was distributing blasphemous pamphlets, and it demanded that the police give up a mad man who had sought safety at the police outpost. On 9 August 2008, a Muslim mob in Kano state beat to death a fifty-year-old Muslim man who blasphemed Mohammed. On 20 April 2008, Muslim rioters in the city of Kano burned the shops and vehicles of Christian merchants after one allegedly disparaged Mohammed. On 9 February 2008, a Muslim mob rioted in the town of Sumaila in Kano state. The mob acted upon the alleged distribution of a leaflet that allegedly slandered Mohammed. The mob killed a Christian police inspector and two civilians, and wounded twenty others. The mob set fire to vehicles and destroyed the police station. On 4 February 2008 2:46, a Muslim mob besieged a police station and set it on fire in the city of Yano in Bauchi state. The police station was the refuge of a Christian woman whom the mob accused of desecrating the Quran. One report said that the woman had spurned an offer of marriage from a Muslim man, and that he and his companions had seized the opportunity to riot. In the ensuing violence, five churches were set alight by Muslims, Christian shops were torched, and policemen's homes were attacked and a blood shed happed. The police arrested 1000 children. In October 2007, a sharia court convicted Sani Kabili, a Christian and a father of six, of the town of Kano, of blasphemy against Mohammed. The court sentenced Kabili to three years in prison. In February 2009, an appeal court overturned the conviction. On 28 September 2007, a Muslim mob rioted at Tudun Wada in Kano state. The mob killed nine Christians, burned several churches, and destroyed the homes and businesses of some non-Muslims. The Muslims complained that Christian students had drawn a picture of Mohammed. The Christians reported that the violence erupted after they had prevented one of their members from converting to Islam. On 21 March 2007, a mob of Muslim students and neighbourhood extremists beat to death Christianah Oluwatoyin Oluwasesin, a mother of two and a teacher at Government Secondary School of Gandu in the city of Gombe. A student complained that Oluwasesin, a Christian, had touched a bag which allegedly contained a Quran, and had thereby defiled the Quran. In February 2006, thousands of Muslim rioters went on rampages in different states. The rioters burned churches, torched Christian shops and homes, and killed Christians. The reason for the violence was ostensibly outrage at the publication in the Danish magazine Jyllands-Posten of cartoons that some Muslims consider blasphemous. In February 2006 in Bauchi state, Florence Chuckwu, a Christian teacher, confiscated a copy of a Quran from a pupil who was reading it during an English lesson. The incident provoked rioting by Muslims. The riot killed more than twenty Christians and destroyed two churches. On 20 November 2002, Muslim and Christian mobs rampaged in the cities of Kaduna and Abuja. The rampage began after an article in a daily newspaper, Thisday, suggested that Mohammed would have approved of a Miss World pageant that was taking place in Abuja. Thisday columnist Isioma Daniel wrote that Mohammed would probably have taken a wife from among the contestants. Muslim mobs accused the newspaper of blasphemy, and burned down its office building in Kaduna. Then the mobs attacked churches and properties owned by Christians. Christian mobs confronted the Muslim mobs. Soldiers and police intervened. About two hundred and fifty people died. Isioma Daniel fled Nigeria ahead of a fatwa that called upon Muslims to kill her.

In common with other contemporary submarines, they feature air-independent propulsion. They are oceanic submarines of medium tonnage with the capacity to carry out long duration missions in scenarios far from their base, acting with a minimum level of indiscretion. They will have an integrated platform control system that allows operation with a reduced endowment and a high degree of automation with remote control. The characteristics of this class of ships place them at a level close to those of nuclear propulsion. The lead ship in the class, the Isaac Peral (S-81), was planned to enter service in 2021, and the rest in 2022-24. The S-80 class has also been offered for export. Capabilities S-80 Plus-class submarines are designed to improve threat scenario missions. Their operational mobility will allow them to operate in remote areas, traveling discreetly at high speeds. Their air independent propulsion (AIP) system, of new technological design, will ensure their ability to remain in an area for a very long period of time without being detected and their ability to operate in possible conflict zones. Capabilities include: *A combat system for multiple target acquisition in different scenarios *The ability to transport personnel, including special operations forces *Low noise and magnetic signatures in order to minimize detection *Low radar and infrared signatures in order to minimize detection Propulsion The S-80's air-independent propulsion (AIP) system is based on a bioethanol-processor consisting of a reaction chamber and several intermediate Coprox reactors. Provided by Hynergreen from Abengoa, the system transforms the bioethanol (BioEtOH) into high purity hydrogen. The output feeds a series of fuel cells from UTC Power company. The Reformator is fed with bioethanol as fuel and oxygen (stored as a liquid in a high pressure cryogenic tank), generating hydrogen and carbon dioxide as subproducts. The produced hydrogen and more oxygen is fed to the fuel cells. The bioethanol- processor also produces a stream of highly concentrated carbon dioxide and other trace gases that are not burned completely during combustion. This gas flow is mixed with sea water in one or more ejector venturi scrubber and then through a new system, SECO2 (or CO2 Removal System), developed by Bionet, and whose purpose is to dissolve the \\"bubbles\\" of CO2 in water to undetectable levels. The oxygen and fuel flow rates are directly determined by the demand for power. The AIP power in the S-80 submarine is at least . A permanent- magnet electric motor moves a fixed propeller of a special design, that doesn't create cavitations at high speed. History In the 1980s France began studies for the replacement of their S-60 Daphn√©-class diesel submarines. The French shipyard DCNI came up with an all-new design called S-80, with a teardrop hull and new weapons and sensors, which their government decided not to fund. DCNI then proposed a cheaper option called the S-90B, an S-70 Agosta-class submarine with limited improvements which was again rejected by the French but which was exported to Pakistan. Meanwhile, Spain faced the same problem in replacing their Daphn√©s, known as the Delf√≠n class in Spanish service, as part of Plan ALTAMAR. Baz√°n (later Izar, and then Navantia) started on a new design but when it started to look like the S-80, it was agreed to collaborate in a joint venture based on the French S-80. This joint design was shown at Le Bourget Navale in October 1990. The end of the Cold War meant that funding dried up and the joint venture had to wait until 1997 for their first sale - to Chile - of the new design, which was designated the in export markets. The same year Spain started to look again at its requirements, and in 1998 they indicated that they would buy four Scorp√®nes, optionally with an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system for greater endurance when submerged. A staff requirement for the S-80 Scorp√®ne variant was completed in October 2001. Alt URL This was soon overtaken by events, as the Armada (navy) became more interested in using submarines for power projection than in a more static, defensive role. This shift was codified in guidance of January 2002 from the Chief of Naval Operations and in the strategic defence review of February 2003. The new requirement called for a larger submarine with better endurance and land-attack missiles, which became known as the S-80A design. This was an AIP submarine with a hull diameter of compared to for the Scorp√®ne family, a submerged displacement of around 2,400 tonnes versus 1,740 tonnes, larger rudder surfaces and a different fin position. The Spanish government approved the purchase of four S-80A submarines in September 2003 and signed a contract with Izar on 24 March 2004. The original deal was ‚Ç¨1,756m to design and build four submarines, about ‚Ç¨439m per boat, but by 2010 this had increased to ‚Ç¨2,212m ( ~~‚Ç¨~~ 553m/boat). The plan envisaged the first boat to be delivered in 2011 but government dithering over who should supply the combat system pushed it back to 2013. In 2011 Spain's budget crisis further delayed the first delivery until 2015, with the remaining boats being delivered at one year intervals until 2018. Construction of S-81 began on 13 December 2007. In January 2012 the names were announced, honouring three engineers who made submarines and the first commander of Spain's submarine force respectively - Isaac Peral (S-81), Narciso Monturiol (S-82), Cosme Garc√≠a (S-83) and Mateo Garc√≠a de los Reyes (S-84). In May 2013, Navantia announced that a serious weight imbalance design flaw had been identified which will delay the delivery of the first submarine to the Spanish Navy until possibly 2017. Lengthening the submarine created additional buoyancy. Navantia signed on the US company General Dynamics Electric Boat to help solve the excess weight. In September 2014, the detected overweight was reported to have been resolved and the construction work to be ready to resume in late October 2014.Navantia corrige el proyecto del S-80 y espera la orden para retomar la obra. Antonio L√≥pez, La Verdad. In November 2014, Navantia again reported having completed the redesign work to address the problem of overweight. In all, the hull will be lengthened by seven metres, and the displacement increased by 75 tons. , the intended delivery date of the first submarine is September 2022. In January 2017, it was reported that the AIP system would not be ready in time for the delivery of the first submarine. In November 2018 the companies Abengoa and Tecnicas Reunidas, said they had completed in an excellent way, their tests for the revolutionary AIP engine of the submarine. The Indian Navy considered the S-80 for its next generation of submarines under Project 75I.

Fish defences against disease are specific and non-specific. Non-specific defences include skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps microorganisms and inhibits their growth. If pathogens breach these defences, fish can develop inflammatory responses that increase the flow of blood to infected areas and deliver white blood cells that attempt to destroy the pathogens. Specific defences are specialised responses to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, that is adaptative immune responses.Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, pp 95-96, 1997, In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and ornamental fish, for example vaccines for furunculosis in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.Cipriano RC (2001) \\"Furunculosis And Other Diseases Caused By Aeromonas salmonicida\\" Fish Disease Leaflet 66, US Department of the Interior.Hartman KH et al. (2004) \\"Koi Herpes Virus (KHV) Disease\\". Fact Sheet VM-149. University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Some commercially important fish diseases are VHS, ich and whirling disease. Disease A veterinarian gives an injection to a goldfish All fish carry pathogens and parasites. Usually this is at some cost to the fish. If the cost is sufficiently high, then the impacts can be characterised as a disease. However disease in fish is not understood well.Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 465 What is known about fish disease often relates to aquaria fish, and more recently, to farmed fish. Disease is a prime agent affecting fish mortality, especially when fish are young. Fish can limit the impacts of pathogens and parasites with behavioural or biochemical means, and such fish have reproductive advantages. Interacting factors result in low grade infection becoming fatal diseases. In particular, things that causes stress, such as natural droughts or pollution or predators, can precipitate outbreak of disease. Disease can also be particularly problematic when pathogens and parasites carried by introduced species affect native species. An introduced species may find invading easier if potential predators and competitors have been decimated by disease.Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 615 Pathogens which can cause fish diseases comprise: * viral infections, such as esocid lymphosarcoma found in Esox species. * bacterial infections, such as Pseudomonas fluorescens leading to fin rot and fish dropsy * fungal infections * water mould infections, such as Saprolegnia sp. * metazoan parasites, such as copepods * unicellular parasites, such as Ichthyophthirius multifiliis leading to ich * Certain parasites like Helminths for example Eustrongylides Parasites Oodinium, a genus of parasitic dinoflagellates, causes velvet disease in fish Parasites in fish are a common natural occurrence. Parasites can provide information about host population ecology. In fisheries biology, for example, parasite communities can be used to distinguish distinct populations of the same fish species co-inhabiting a region. Additionally, parasites possess a variety of specialized traits and life-history strategies that enable them to colonize hosts. Understanding these aspects of parasite ecology, of interest in their own right, can illuminate parasite-avoidance strategies employed by hosts. Usually parasites (and pathogens) need to avoid killing their hosts, since extinct hosts can mean extinct parasites. Evolutionary constraints may operate so parasites avoid killing their hosts, or the natural variability in host defensive strategies may suffice to keep host populations viable. Parasite infections can impair the courtship dance of male threespine sticklebacks. When that happens, the females reject them, suggesting a strong mechanism for the selection of parasite resistance.\\" However, not all parasites want to keep their hosts alive, and there are parasites with multistage life cycles who go to some trouble to kill their host. For example, some tapeworms make some fish behave in such a way that a predatory bird can catch it. The predatory bird is the next host for the parasite in the next stage of its life cycle. Specifically, the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus turns infected threespine stickleback white, and then makes them more buoyant so that they splash along at the surface of the water, becoming easy to see and easy to catch for a passing bird. Parasites can be internal (endoparasites) or external (ectoparasites). Some internal fish parasites are spectacular, such as the philometrid nematode Philometra fasciati which is parasitic in the ovary of female Blacktip grouper; the adult female parasite is a red worm which can reach up to 40 centimetres in length, for a diameter of only 1.6 millimetre; the males are tiny. Other internal parasites are found living inside fish gills, include encysted adult didymozoid trematodes,Pozdnyakov, S. E. & Gibson, D. I. (2008). Family Didymozoidae Monticelli, 1888. In R. A. Bray, D. I. Gibson & A. Jones (Eds.), Keys to the Trematoda, Vol. 3 (pp. 631-734). London: CAB International and The Natural History Museum. a few trichosomoidid nematodes of the genus Huffmanela, including Huffmanela ossicola which lives within the gill bone, and the encysted parasitic turbellarian Paravortex. Various protists and Myxosporea are also parasitic on gills, where they form cysts. Fish gills are also the preferred habitat of many external parasites, attached to the gill but living out of it. The most common are monogeneans and certain groups of parasitic copepods, which can be extremely numerous.Kearn, G. C. (2004). Leeches, Lice and Lampreys. A natural history of skin and gill parasites of fishes. Dordrecht: Springer. Other external parasites found on gills are leeches and, in seawater, larvae of gnathiid isopods. Isopod fish parasites are mostly external and feed on blood. The larvae of the Gnathiidae family and adult cymothoidids have piercing and sucking mouthparts and clawed limbs adapted for clinging onto their hosts. Cymothoa exigua is a parasite of various marine fish. It causes the tongue of the fish to atrophy and takes its place in what is believed to be the first instance discovered of a parasite functionally replacing a host structure in animals. Other parasitic disorders, include Gyrodactylus salaris, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, cryptocaryon, velvet disease, Brooklynella hostilis, Hole in the head, Glugea, Ceratomyxa shasta, Kudoa thyrsites, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, Cymothoa exigua, leeches, nematode, flukes, carp lice and salmon lice. Although parasites are generally considered to be harmful, the eradication of all parasites would not necessarily be beneficial. Parasites account for as much as or more than half of life's diversity; they perform an important ecological role (by weakening prey) that ecosystems would take some time to adapt to; and without parasites organisms may eventually tend to asexual reproduction, diminishing the diversity of sexually dimorphic traits. Parasites provide an opportunity for the transfer of genetic material between species. On rare, but significant, occasions this may facilitate evolutionary changes that would not otherwise occur, or that would otherwise take even longer.Claude Combes, The Art of being a Parasite, U. of Chicago Press, 2005 Below are some life cycles of fish parasites: File:Life cycle of Ichthyophthirius multifiliis.jpg File:Life cycle2.jpg File:Bucephaluslifecycle.jpg File:Life cycle of Huffmanela huffmani Moravec, 1987.png Cleaner fish Two cleaner wrasses, Labroides phthirophagus, servicing a goatfish, Mulloidichthys flavolineatus Some fish take advantage of cleaner fish for the removal of external parasites. The best known of these are the Bluestreak cleaner wrasses of the genus Labroides found on coral reefs in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. These small fish maintain so-called \\"cleaning stations\\" where other fish, known as hosts, will congregate and perform specific movements to attract the attention of the cleaner fish.Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 380, 1997, Cleaning behaviours have been observed in a number of other fish groups, including an interesting case between two cichlids of the same genus, Etroplus maculatus, the cleaner fish, and the much larger Etroplus suratensis, the host. More than 40 species of parasites may reside on the skin and internally of the ocean sunfish, motivating the fish to seek relief in a number of ways. In temperate regions, drifting kelp fields harbour cleaner wrasses and other fish which remove parasites from the skin of visiting sunfish. In the tropics, the mola will solicit cleaner help from reef fishes. By basking on its side at the surface, the sunfish also allows seabirds to feed on parasites from their skin. Sunfish have been reported to breach more than ten feet above the surface, possibly as another effort to dislodge parasites on the body. Mass die offs The complex life cycle of Pfiesteria piscidica. Red = toxic stages, yellow = possibly toxic stages, blue = passive stages Some diseases result in mass die offs.Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 466 One of the more bizarre and recently discovered diseases produces huge fish kills in shallow marine waters. It is caused by the ambush predator dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida. When large numbers of fish, like shoaling forage fish, are in confined situations such as shallow bays, the excretions from the fish encourage this dinoflagellate, which is not normally toxic, to produce free-swimming zoospores. If the fish remain in the area, continuing to provide nourishment, then the zoospores start secreting a neurotoxin. This toxin results in the fish developing bleeding lesions, and their skin flakes off in the water. The dinoflagellates then eat the blood and flakes of tissue while the affected fish die.Burkholder JM, Glasgow HB and Hobbs CW (1995) \\"Fish kills linked to a toxic ambush-predator dinoflagellate: distribution and environmental conditions\\" Marine Ecology Progress Series. Fish kills by this dinoflagellate are common, and they may also have been responsible for kills in the past which were thought to have had other causes. Kills like these can be viewed as natural mechanisms for regulating the population of exceptionally abundant fish. The rate at which the kills occur increases as organically polluted land runoff increases. Wild salmon Henneguya salminicola, a parasite commonly found in the flesh of salmonids on the West Coast of Canada. Coho salmon According to Canadian biologist Dorothy Kieser, protozoan parasite Henneguya salminicola is commonly found in the flesh of salmonids. It has been recorded in the field samples of salmon returning to the Queen Charlotte Islands. The fish responds by walling off the parasitic infection into a number of cysts that contain milky fluid. This fluid is an accumulation of a large number of parasites. Henneguya and other parasites in the myxosporean group have a complex lifecycle where the salmon is one of two hosts. The fish releases the spores after spawning. In the Henneguya case, the spores enter a second host, most likely an invertebrate, in the spawning stream. When juvenile salmon out-migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon. The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle. The myxosporean parasite that causes whirling disease in trout, has a similar lifecycle. However, as opposed to whirling disease, the Henneguya infestation does not appear to cause disease in the host salmon ‚Äî even heavily infected fish tend to return to spawn successfully. According to Dr. Kieser, a lot of work on Henneguya salminicola was done by scientists at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s, in particular, an overview report which states that \\"the fish that have the longest fresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections. Hence in order of prevalence coho are most infected followed by sockeye, chinook, chum and pink.\\" As well, the report says that, at the time the studies were conducted, stocks from the middle and upper reaches of large river systems in British Columbia such as Fraser, Skeena, Nass and from mainland coastal streams in the southern half of B.C. \\"are more likely to have a low prevalence of infection.\\" The report also states \\"It should be stressed that Henneguya, economically deleterious though it is, is harmless from the view of public health. It is strictly a fish parasite that cannot live in or affect warm blooded animals, including man\\". Sample of pink salmon infected with Henneguya salminicola, caught off Haida Gwaii, Western Canada in 2009 According to Klaus Schallie, Molluscan Shellfish Program Specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, \\"Henneguya salminicola is found in southern B.C. also and in all species of salmon. I have previously examined smoked chum salmon sides that were riddled with cysts and some sockeye runs in Barkley Sound (southern B.C., west coast of Vancouver Island) are noted for their high incidence of infestation.\\" Sea lice, particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis and a variety of Caligus species, including Caligus clemensi and Caligus rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon.Sea Lice and Salmon: Elevating the dialogue on the farmed-wild salmon story Watershed Watch Salmon Society, 2004.Bravo, S. (2003). \\"Sea lice in Chilean salmon farms\\". Bull. Eur. Assoc. Fish Pathol. 23, 197‚Äì200. Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucous, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic naupli and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days.Peet, C. R. 2007. Thesis, University of Victoria. Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result. Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable. On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%.Krko≈°ek, Martin, et al.

Farmed salmon Atlantic salmon In 1972, Gyrodactylus salaris, also called salmon fluke, a monogenean parasite, spread from Norwegian hatcheries to wild salmon, and devastated some wild salmon populations.Stead, SM and Laird lLM (2002) Handbook of salmon farming, page 348, Birkh√§user. In 1984, infectious salmon anemia (ISAv) was discovered in Norway in an Atlantic salmon hatchery. Eighty percent of the fish in the outbreak died. ISAv, a viral disease, is now a major threat to the viability of Atlantic salmon farming. It is now the first of the diseases classified on List One of the European Commission‚Äôs fish health regime. Amongst other measures, this requires the total eradication of the entire fish stock should an outbreak of the disease be confirmed on any farm. ISAv seriously affects salmon farms in Chile, Norway, Scotland and Canada, causing major economic losses to infected farms.New Brunswick to help Chile beat disease Fish Information and Services As the name implies, it causes severe anemia of infected fish. Unlike mammals, the red blood cells of fish have DNA, and can become infected with viruses. The fish develop pale gills, and may swim close to the water surface, gulping for air. However, the disease can also develop without the fish showing any external signs of illness, the fish maintain a normal appetite, and then they suddenly die. The disease can progress slowly throughout an infected farm and, in the worst cases, death rates may approach 100 percent. It is also a threat to the dwindling stocks of wild salmon. Management strategies include developing a vaccine and improving genetic resistance to the disease.Fact Sheet - Atlantic Salmon Aquaculture Research Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Retrieved 12 May 2009. In the wild, diseases and parasites are normally at low levels, and kept in check by natural predation on weakened individuals. In crowded net pens they can become epidemics. Diseases and parasites also transfer from farmed to wild salmon populations. A recent study in British Columbia links the spread of parasitic sea lice from river salmon farms to wild pink salmon in the same river.\\"Seafood Choices Alliance (2005) It's all about salmon The European Commission (2002) concluded ‚ÄúThe reduction of wild salmonid abundance is also linked to other factors but there is more and more scientific evidence establishing a direct link between the number of lice-infested wild fish and the presence of cages in the same estuary.‚ÄùScientific Evidence . It is reported that wild salmon on the west coast of Canada are being driven to extinction by sea lice from nearby salmon farms.Krkosek M, Ford JS, Morton A, Lele S, Myers RA and Lewis MA (2007) Declining Wild Salmon Populations in Relation to Parasites from Farm Salmon Science, 318, 5857: 1772.] Antibiotics and pesticides are often used to control the diseases and parasites. File:ASalmonicida.pngAeromonas salmonicida, a Gram-negative bacteria, causes the disease furunculosis in marine and freshwater fish.

File:C Shasta.gifCeratomyxa shasta, another myxosporean parasite, infects salmonid fish on the Pacific coast of North America. Coral reef fish Coral reef fish are characterized by high biodiversity. As a consequence parasites of coral reef fish show tremendous variety. Parasites of coral reef fish include nematodes, Platyhelminthes (cestodes, digeneans, and monogeneans), leeches, parasitic crustaceans such as isopods and copepods, and various microorganisms such as myxosporidia and microsporidia. Some of these fish parasites have heteroxenous life cycles (i.e. they have several hosts) among which sharks (certain cestodes) or molluscs (digeneans). The high biodiversity of coral reefs increases the complexity of the interactions between parasites and their various and numerous hosts. Numerical estimates of parasite biodiversity have shown that certain coral fish species have up to 30 species of parasites. Free PDF Justine, J.-L., Beveridge, I., Boxshall, G. A., Bray, R. A., Moravec, F. & Whittington, I.

Belgian Journal of Zoology, 140 (Suppl.), 155-190. Free PDF The mean number of parasites per fish species is about ten. This has a consequence in term of co-extinction. Results obtained for the coral reef fish of New Caledonia suggest that extinction of a coral reef fish species of average size would eventually result in the co-extinction of at least ten species of parasites. Aquarium fish Nitrogen cycle in a common aquarium. Ornamental fish kept in aquariums are susceptible to numerous diseases. In most aquarium tanks, the fish are at high concentrations and the volume of water is limited. This means that communicable diseases can spread rapidly to most or all fish in a tank. An improper nitrogen cycle, inappropriate aquarium plants and potentially harmful freshwater invertebrates can directly harm or add to the stresses on ornamental fish in a tank. Despite this, many diseases in captive fish can be avoided or prevented through proper water conditions and a well-adjusted ecosystem within the tank. Ammonia poisoning is a common disease in new aquariums, especially when immediately stocked to full capacity. Due to their generally small size and the low cost of replacing diseased or dead aquarium fish, the cost of testing and treating diseases is often seen as more trouble than the value of the fish.

Zapata, A. Chiba and A. Vara. Cells and tissues of the immune system of fish. In: The Fish Immune System: Organism, Pathogen and Environment. Fish Immunology Series. (eds. G. Iwama and T.Nakanishi,), New York, Academic Press, 1996, pp. 1‚Äì55. In the jawless fish (lampreys and hagfish), true lymphoid organs are absent. These fish rely on regions of lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, erythrocytes, macrophages and plasma cells are produced in the anterior kidney (or pronephros) and some areas of the gut (where granulocytes mature.) They resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish. Cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) have a more advanced immune system. They have three specialized organs that are unique to chondrichthyes; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the Leydig's organ within the walls of their esophagus, and a spiral valve in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable thymus and a well-developed spleen (their most important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored. Chondrostean fish (sturgeons, paddlefish and bichirs) possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the meninges (membranes surrounding the central nervous system.) Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, reticular cells and a small number of macrophages. The chondrostean kidney is an important hemopoietic organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop. Like chondrostean fish, the major immune tissues of bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the anterior kidney), which houses many different immune cells.D.P. Anderson. Fish Immunology. (S.F. Snieszko and H.R. Axelrod, eds), Hong Kong: TFH Publications, Inc. Ltd., 1977. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes are believed to reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus. In 2006, a lymphatic system similar to that in mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen. Spreading disease and parasites The capture, transportation and culture of bait fish can spread damaging organisms between ecosystems, endangering them. In 2007, several American states, including Michigan, enacted regulations designed to slow the spread of fish diseases, including viral hemorrhagic septicemia, by bait fish.DNR Fishing Regulation Changes Reflect Disease Management Concerns with VHS Because of the risk of transmitting Myxobolus cerebralis (whirling disease), trout and salmon should not be used as bait. Anglers may increase the possibility of contamination by emptying bait buckets into fishing venues and collecting or using bait improperly. The transportation of fish from one location to another can break the law and cause the introduction of fish and parasites alien to the ecosystem.

The popularity of such raw fish dishes makes it important for consumers to be aware of this risk. Raw fish should be frozen to an internal temperature of ‚àí20 ¬∞C (‚àí4 ¬∞F) for at least 7 days to kill parasites. It is important to be aware that home freezers may not be cold enough to kill parasites.Parasites in Marine Fishes University of California Food Science & Technology Department Sea Grant Extension Program Vaughn M. Sushi and Sashimi Safety Traditionally, fish that live all or part of their lives in fresh water were considered unsuitable for sashimi due to the possibility of parasites (see Sashimi article). Parasitic infections from freshwater fish are a serious problem in some parts of the world, particularly Southeast Asia. Fish that spend part of their life cycle in salt water, like salmon, can also be a problem. A study in Seattle, Washington showed that 100% of wild salmon had roundworm larvae capable of infecting people. In the same study farm raised salmon did not have any roundworm larvae. Parasite infection by raw fish is rare in the developed world (fewer than 40 cases per year in the U.S.), and involves mainly three kinds of parasites: Clonorchis sinensis (a trematode/fluke), Anisakis (a nematode/roundworm) and Diphyllobothrium (a cestode/tapeworm). Infection by the fish tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum is seen in countries where people eat raw or undercooked fish, such as some countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Africa, and North and South America.U.S. National Library of Medicine, Medline Plus, \\"Fish Tapeworm,\\" . Infection risk of anisakis is particularly higher in fishes which may live in a river such as salmon (shake) in Salmonidae, mackerel (saba). Such parasite infections can generally be avoided by boiling, burning, preserving in salt or vinegar, or freezing overnight. Even Japanese people never eat raw salmon or ikura (salmon roe), and even if they seem raw, these foods are not raw but are frozen overnight to prevent infections from parasites, particularly anisakis.

North is to right. The streets of Albany, New York have had a long history going back almost 400 years. Many of the streets have changed names over the course of time, some have changed names many times. Some streets no longer exist, others have changed course. Some roads existed only on paper. The oldest streets were haphazardly laid out with no overall plan until Simeon De Witt's 1794 street grid plan. The plan had two grids, one west of Eagle Street and the old stockade, and another for the Pastures District south of the old stockade. Early colonial streets These streets had their starts during the Dutch colonial era in the 17th century, some such as Broadway, State, and Pearl streets grew and continued to stretch out into the countryside, while some such as Van Tromp are short stubby streets one block long. Others are so narrow that today they are blocked off to vehicular traffic. =State Street= Albany's original \\"main street\\". The original name was Yonker Street, it and Broadway are the two oldest streets in Albany. Three structures sat in the middle of the street, from east to west they were- the original Dutch Reformed church, St. Peter's Anglican Church, and Fort Frederick; by 1810 they had been demolished. State Street west of Eagle Street was called Deer Street, today it is sometimes referred to as \\"upper\\" State Street to distinguish it from the older \\"lower\\" State Street. \\"Upper\\" State Street is a one-way street traveling east and goes from a Y-intersection with Western Avenue and continues east to Eagle Street. There are two other discontinuous sections of State Street, one is blocked from \\"upper\\" State Street by the downtown campus of the University at Albany, SUNY (SUNY Albany) and is a one-way street travelling west from Cortland Place to O'Leary Boulevard (Partridge Street) then is blocked by the downtown dorms of SUNY Albany, Albany High School, and St. Mary's Park. The next section goes from North Main to North Pine streets. State Street from Broadway to Eagle Street is part of New York Route 5, though this is an unsigned part of the route. =Broadway= Broadway Called Handalaers Street on the Miller map of 1695. One of the original streets within the Dutch stockade, it and State Street are the two oldest streets in Albany. The intersection with Yonker (State) Street is where the original Dutch Church sat until 1806. North of State Street it became known as Market Street. The second oldest house in Albany, the Quackenbush House was built along Broadway. Handalaers Street was changed to Market Street, and then in 1815 Court Street became South Market and Market became North Market. Broadway from Madison Avenue north out of the city was once New York Route 2 until the 1980s. The only portion of Broadway within the city of Albany that is part of a state or US route is a small section from State Street south to Hamilton Street is part of New York Route 5, though unsigned as such. =Pearl Street= North Pearl Street Another early Dutch street today it is part of NY Route 32 (NY 32) and is a core of downtown Albany, lined with bars, nightclubs, and entertainment venues such as the Times Union Center, the Palace Theatre, and the Capital Repertory Theatre. The intersection with State Street was once called Elm Street Corner, where stood an Elm Tree planted by Philip Livingston, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. South of State Street the road was a path to the common pastures owned by the Dutch Church, it was one of many such paths referred to as \\"Cow Lane\\". After the Revolution it was named Washington Street in honor of George Washington. In 1814/15 Pearl Street north of State was renamed North Pearl while the street south of State was renamed South Pearl. In 1804 the Albany and Bethlehem Turnpike was chartered and constructed as a continuation of South Pearl Street through the hamlet of Kenwood to the hamlet of Bethlehem Center. In 1870 a portion of Kenwood was annexed to Albany and the city was involved in a lawsuit (Harriet M. Elmendorf v. The City of Albany) over its right to lay sidewalks along the turnpike (technically private property) and to levy an assessment upon property in order to cover the cost of the sidewalk. The entire length of Pearl Street was part of NY 32 until the 1960s, today going north NY 32 leaves South Pearl Street at Interstate 787 (I-787) and returns to South Pearl at the intersection with Rensselaer and Morton streets. =Hudson Avenue= Originally called Hudson Street it laid along the southern edge of the stockade, the oldest building in Albany is at 48 Hudson Avenue and built at a time when Hudson Street was little more than a path along the outside of the stockade. Over time it was continued west as far as Washington Park. On the other side of Washington Park, Hudson Street started again along the same line. When the Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza was built a large section of Hudson Avenue disappeared. Today Hudson Ave is split into four sections. Hudson Ave exists from Broadway until South Pearl Street where the South Mall Arterial and Empire State Plaza covers its route, then again from Swan Street to Willett Street where Washington Park stands in the way, then South Lake to Partridge where the College of Saint Rose sits, and then Hudson Ave continues from Main to Allen. =Maiden Lane and Pine Street= Maiden Lane and Pine Street are two parallel streets with an entwined history. Maiden Lane is the older of the two, it was one of the original streets within the stockade and was called Rom Street. Being one block north of State Street it was often used as a service road for the buildings fronting on the north side of State. Maiden Lane ran from Fort Albany and western edge of the stockade east to the Hudson River, where there was a ferry that crossed to the other side of the river. After Fort Albany and the stockade were removed Maiden Lane was extended west as far as Eagle Street where it met the Kings Highway from Schenectady (today Washington Avenue). Pine Street was originally a short two block street running west from Barrack Street (now Chapel) to the stockade and later as far as the Public Square (today Eagle Street). A proposal in 1831 to extend Pine from Chapel east to Broadway at a cost of $45‚Äì60,000 was defeated. In the 1970s an urban renewal project called the Hotel Ten Eyck Project destroyed Maiden Lane between Chapel and North Pearl streets, while Pine Street was finally extended east from Chapel to Broadway to take up the traffic that could no longer use Maiden Lane. Maiden Lane between Eagle and Chapel streets has since been renamed Corning Place in honor of Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd, and the section between North Pearl and James streets is the only section named Maiden still open to vehicular traffic, the rest of the remaining sections being turned into a pedestrian mall. The Hudson River Way pedestrian bridge over Interstate 787 goes from where Maiden Lane meets Broadway and allows for access to the Corning Preserve and Hudson River. =Clinton Avenue= Formerly Patroon Street, named for being the dividing line of the city of Albany to the south and the patroonship of the Van Rensselaers to the north per the Dongan Charter. It was renamed in honor of DeWitt Clinton as Clinton Avenue. De Witt streets Simeon De Witt's 1794 grid plan for Albany, north is to the right. In the 1790s Simeon De Witt made a grid plan for future streets in Albany, one grid for west of Eagle Street and one grid for the Pastures. West of Eagle Street the east‚Äìwest streets were named for mammals while the north‚Äìsouth streets were named for birds. The bird names were, in order from east to west- Eagle, Hawk, Swan, Dove, Lark, Swallow (Knox and Henry Johnson Boulevard), Snipe (Lexington Avenue, portion of New Scotland Avenue), Duck (now Robin), Pigeon (now Lake Avenue), Turkey (Quail), Sparrow (Ontario), and Partridge. The mammal streets were, in order from north to south- Hare (Orange), Fox (Sheridan Avenue), Elk, Lion (Washington Avenue), Deer (State), Tiger (Lancaster), Buffaloe [sic] (Hudson Avenue), Wolf (Madison Avenue), Otter (Elm), and Mink (Myrtle). Many of these streets were not brand new though the names were. Prior to the 1790s- Eagle was Duke, Swan was Boscawen, Dove was Warren, Lark was Johnson, Swallow was Gage, Snipe was Schenectady, Duck was Schoharie, Hare was Wall, Fox was Howe, Lion was King, \\"upper\\" State was Prince, Tiger was Prideaux, Buffalo was Quiter (Native American name given to Albany's first mayor), Otter was Pitt, and Mink was Monckton.Tony Opalka (City Historian), \\"Why are so many streets named after birds?\\", Capital Neighbors, Spring 2010, p. 3. With the exception of Elk Street all the mammal names were changed over time. Many of the mammal streets changed names to that of the older downtown streets as they were later connected, such as Buffaloe Street changing to Hudson (Street) Avenue, and Deer Street changing to State Street. A few of the bird streets were changed as well, such as Snipe to Lexington Avenue and Swallow to Knox; while some bird-named streets simply changed to a more respected bird; such as Duck to Robin and Turkey to Quail. Because of ravines, swamps, and other undesirable building ground some of the streets were not opened over their entire planned length, leading to large gaps in street numbering. Some of the undesirable land would in time be taken by parks or large institutions, forever splitting some streets into two, three, or even four parts. =Madison Avenue= Madison Ave was originally two separate streets in the De Witt plan, Lydius Street in the Pastures from the Hudson River to Dallius Street (Dongan Street), and named Wolf Street west from Eagle Street. As time went on and Lydius Street headed uphill from South Pearl that section came to be called \\"Lydius continued\\". Wolf Street would change to Lydius when the roads were connected at Eagle. What is now Madison Place was called Madison Avenue, Lydius would take the name Madison Ave and Madison Place would get its current name. In 1864 the state of New York passed Laws of 1864 Chapter 434, entitled AN ACT to amend an act entitled \\"An act to form a separate road district of all that part of the city of Albany lying west of Allen street, and to exempt the same from certain taxes.\\", banned the city from improving, grading, or opening Madison Ave west from Allen Street to Magazine Street. Allen Street continues to be the western termination of Madison Ave, the street never being opened any further. In the west Madison Ave meets Western Avenue at a wye-intersection, it is referred to as \\"The Point\\" and it was here that the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, the first railroad in the state of New York, had its Albany terminal. The right-of-way of Wolf Street/Lydius Street was to continue indefinitely, and today East Lydius Street in the town of Guilderland continues down the same line of the original plan of Wolf Street. The same is true of Madison Avenue Extension and much of Washington Avenue Extension in the Pine Bush of the city of Albany. In 1994 the city sold the \\"paper street\\" of Madison Avenue Extension adjacent to Crossgates Commons to the shopping center's then-owner Washington Commons Associates (today The Pyramid Companies). Today, Madison Avenue from South Pearl Street west, forms part of U.S. Route 20. Madison Avenue forms the majority of the northern border of the Mansion Historic District, and has along its route Bleecker Park, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Empire State Plaza, New York State Museum, Dana Park, Washington Park, College of Saint Rose, and one of only two movie theaters in the city. =Washington Avenue= Originally King Street until the 1790 De Witt plan, it then became Lion Street. It was the beginning of the \\"King's Highway\\", a series of paths to Schenectady. Washington Avenue begins in the east at Eagle Street and from there it is New York Route 5 until the Y-intersection where Central Avenue splits to the north-east, NY 5 then follows Central. Washington Avenue from Quail Street to Manning Boulevard was in the late 1890s given by the state to the Washington Park Board of Commissioners to improve as a \\"speedway\\" or \\"public driveway\\". Today many important locations sit along Washington Ave such as the New York State Capitol, New York State Education Building, the Alfred E. Smith Building, One Commerce Plaza, downtown campus of SUNY Albany, the Albany High School, the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus, and the uptown campus of SUNY Albany. At Fuller Road, Washington Avenue becomes Washington Avenue Extension (NY Route 910D), to New Karner Road (NY Route 155). The extension is a four-lane divided highway with at-grade crossings and access roads flanking the road hosting office parks and Crossgates Commons. Crossgates Commons is home to the largest Walmart in the United States. There is one limited-access exit, it allows access to and from Crossgates Mall in the neighboring town of Guilderland. =Lark Street= Lark Street Lark Street is the main street of Midtown Albany, as well as the Hudson/Park and Center Square neighborhoods. Lark Street, like all the bird streets from De Witt's plan runs north‚Äìsouth. Lark runs north from Myrtle Avenue to Clinton Avenue, a second section starts on Clinton Ave just east of the first section and runs north to Manning Boulevard. On paper Lark Street still runs from Myrtle Ave south to the intersection of Morton Avenue and Hackett Boulevard though this section is not currently built, with the exception of a short common access for a Walgreens and McDonald's on Morton Ave. From Madison Ave to Clinton Ave, Lark Street is US Route 9W. =Knox Street/Northern Boulevard/Henry Johnson Boulevard= Swallow Street (whose name was Gage prior to 1790) was one of the few bird streets whose name was not kept, its name being changed to Knox Street in 1809. Knox Street would stretch north from Myrtle Avenue to Clinton Avenue, and eventually to Livingston Avenue. In 1896 Northern Boulevard was built from that intersection of Knox and Livingston north to Van Rensselaer Boulevard, including a 653-foot-long bridge over Tivoli Hollow and the New York Central Railroad's tracks, a modern bridge still carries Northern Boulevard at that location. In 1898 a 759-foot-long bridge was built to carry Knox from Central Avenue over Sheridan Hollow to Sheridan Avenue, and again a modern bridge is there today. When Washington Park was being created, Knox Street between Madison Ave and State Street was purchased in 1880 and all buildings were removed. Knox Street in the park is now a pedestrian mall, called the Knox Street Mall; it is the only straight path in the park. Later, Knox Street from State to Livingston would be changed to Northern Boulevard to match the street it met up with, this left the name Knox Street as only the three blocks between Myrtle and Madison in the Park South neighborhood. In 1991 Northern Boulevard from Livingston to State along with its extension within Washington Park to Madison Avenue at Willett Street was renamed Henry Johnson Boulevard in honor of an African-American World War I hero. The name Northern Boulevard remains from Livingston to Van Rensselaer Boulevard. Turnpikes Map of Albany in 1895 Starting with the Great Western Turnpike in 1799, turnpikes began to radiate out from Albany into the countryside and also formed long distance routes across the state. Often they were built by private corporations with state charters, they originally had tolls. Over time they would be bought out by the city and become city streets, and they would be designated as state and US highways. =Central Avenue= Central Avenue was first called \\"the Bowery\\", it was at the Albany end of the many Native American trails linking Albany to Schenectady that would come to be called \\"King's Highway\\". Though incorporated as early as 1797 the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike Company did not construct the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike (also known as the Schenectady Turnpike) until 1802 which continued the line of the Bowery straight to Schenectady at State Street. In 1867 Albany changed the name of the Bowery to Central Avenue. Central Ave, which is also New York State Route 5, travels northwest from a Y-intersection with Washington Avenue to the border with the neighboring town of Colonie, just west of the CSXT railroad bridge. Central Avenue is Albany's current Main Street, and is home to Westgate Plaza the Capital District's first \\"suburban\\"-style shopping plaza. The section from Washington Avenue west to Watervliet Avenue is more urban with adjacent buildings and on-street parking. While the section from Watervliet Avenue west to city-line tends to be more suburban, with little or no on-street parking, large parking lots, shopping plazas, restaurants, large car-dealerships, big-box stores and fast food. =Delaware Avenue= Originally called the Delaware Turnpike because it was built over a Native American trail. The Delaware Turnpike was built by the Albany and Delaware Turnpike company, chartered in 1805 by the state of New York to build a road from Albany to Otego (which then was within Delaware County). The turnpike company had abandoned the road in 1868, and the name was changed to Delaware Avenue. Delaware Avenue runs from the intersection of Madison Avenue and Lark Street south and south-west to the city border with the town of Bethlehem. Some important locations along the road include Hackett Middle School, Lincoln Park, the Spectrum 8 movie theatre, a public library branch, the City Square Plaza (shopping plaza), and Graceland Cemetery. Delaware Avenue was also part of New York Route 43 until the 1970s when NY 43 was truncated to the intersection of Third and Broadway in the city of Rensselaer, Delaware then became New York State Route 443. Delaware Ave is also US Route 9W from its intersection with Madison Avenue south to the intersection with Southern Boulevard where 9W leaves for that boulevard. =New Scotland Avenue= The section of New Scotland Avenue from Madison Avenue to Myrtle Avenue was part of the original De Witt \\"bird-named\\" street of Snipe Street. The Albany, Rensselaerville, and Schoharie Plank Road would be chartered in 1850 and would build what is now New Scotland Avenue. The plank road would travel to the west and northwest to connect Albany to the hamlet of Hurstville in the town of Bethlehem, a hamlet that has since been annexed to Albany and no longer exists. The plank road then continued southwest to the Normans Kill (the present-day boundary of the city of Albany) where it crossed on a bridge and continued out to the hamlet of Slingerlands and beyond. The company was allowed to erect toll gates in 1861. New Scotland Avenue was part of New York State Route 85 from 1930 until the mid-1960s when the Slingerlands Bypass was constructed and NY 85 was rerouted on to it and the Crosstown Arterial to end at Interstate 90. Today New Scotland Avenue has many colleges, hospitals, office buildings, and commercial/retail businesses. Albany Medical Center, Albany Law School, Albany College of Pharmacy, Sage College of Albany, a public library branch, a public elementary school and several private schools, St. Peter's Hospital, Maria College, and the Capital Hills At Albany (city-owned golf course) are all along New Scotland Ave. Other historic streets =Melrose Avenue= This short street bisects the Melrose neighborhood next to the Averell Harriman State Office Campus, it stretches from Winthrop Avenue northwest to Brevator Street. Melrose sits on the right-of-way of the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad which went from the Y-intersection of Madison and Western avenues to the city of Schenectady. =Manning Boulevard= Originally called Northern Boulevard the first section built in 1876 by the Board of Commissioners of Washington Park at the same time as Washington Park. It was also referred to as Boulevard. That first section constructed was just east of the toll-booth on Western Avenue, north and east to intersection of Central and Clinton avenues, at what would be called Manning Square. South of Western Avenue, Manning Boulevard was named Hawkins Avenue. In Stvdies for Albany (1914) which was commissioned by the city, it was proposed that Manning Boulevard be extended through Hawkins Avenue and continued to New Scotland Avenue and eventually to Delaware Avenue which it would then form a semicircular parkway around the city. The boulevard received its current name in honor of Daniel Manning, a former park commissioner and Secretary of the Treasury under President Grover Cleveland. Manning Boulevard today extends from Whitehall Road northeast to Western Avenue and then northeast and east on to the intersection of Central and Clinton avenues. The boulevard then travels along the western edge of Swinburne Park. It then turns east to Tivoli Park. On the other side of Tivoli Park, Manning Boulevard continues alongside Livingston Middle School to Northern Boulevard. Manning Boulevard starts again to the south where Northern Boulevard turns southwest to join Henry Johnson Boulevard but the road continues southeast as Manning Boulevard. Manning Boulevard finally ends at Livingston Avenue across from Ten Broeck Street. Between Western and Washington avenues, Manning Blvd is unusual for an Albany city street for the houses along that section are along frontage roads on either side of that boulevard. There are four intersections for access to and from the frontage roads, including one that is also an intersection for Lancaster Street. =Southern Boulevard= Southern Boulevard is a major arterial in Albany connecting the city to Thruway exit 23 and further south to the suburbs in Bethlehem. Construction of Southern Boulevard was authorized by the state in Chapter 295 of the Laws of 1913 as a highway starting in the city at Delaware Avenue through what was then part of Bethlehem, over the Normans Kill gorge and meeting the Albany-Bethlehem Turnpike (also referred to as the Bethlehem or Stone Road) at what is today the intersection of Corning Hill Road and US Route 9W. An original proposal for the route of the highway was down Van Vechten Street between Delaware and McCarty avenues. The road was finished in 1916. Southern Boulevard begins at an intersection with Delaware Avenue opposite the City Square Plaza, US 9W turns onto Southern from Delaware. Southern proceeds southeast to meet McAlpin Street, at which point McAlpin takes the name Southern and the US 9W designation. Southern continues east and after the intersection with the southern terminus of Interstate 787 (I-787), the name Southern Blvd/US 9W turns south while the street continues east as McCarty Avenue. Southern at this point becomes a 4 lane highway and passes over I-787. Exit 23 of Interstate 87/NYS Thruway has entrance and exit ramps meeting Southern Blvd and I-787 has a northbound entrance ramp accessible only for the northbound Southern Blvd lanes. The Thruway Authority headquarters are on the west side of the street before the boulevard leaves the city on a viaduct over the Normans Kill. Numbered streets/avenues There are three sets of numbered roads in Albany, a set of four avenues in the South End, a set of three streets in Arbor Hill, and another set of three streets in North Albany. Second, Third, and Fourth avenues in the South End were until 1873 named Whitehall Road, Van Vechten Street, and Nucella Street. Second and Third streets in Arbor Hill were Elizabeth and John. Democratic Party boss Daniel P. O'Connell was born at 1 Second Ave on the corner with South Pearl Street, where a historical marker has commemorated the spot since 1986. Limited- access highways Starting with the Governor Thomas E. Dewey Thruway in the mid-1950s Albany has had several limited-access highways planned for connecting it with other cities in the Northeastern United States and beyond. Many of these highways were never built, while some were only partially built. =New York State Thruway= In 1952-3 Albany's portion of the Thruway was built, connecting Albany to the other major cities of the state- New York, Schenectady, Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo. It is at Albany that the north-bound highway from Downstate turns west. The highway enters Albany from Bethlehem over the Normans Kill. Shortly after entering Albany is exit 23, the second busiest exit in the Thruway system, which connects the Thruway to Southern Boulevard (US Route 9W) which is a surface street, and to Interstate 787. The Thruway then turns northwest and passes under Delaware and New Scotland avenues before briefly leaving the city right before reaching the Slingerlands Bypass (New York Route 85). The Thruway again reenters the city after a short stretch in Bethlehem to pass under Krumkill Road before leaving the city once more by way of a bridge over the Krum Kill. The Thruway enters Albany one last time by passing underneath Washington Avenue Extension from Guilderland. Exit 24, the busiest exit on the Thruway, is here at the western end of Albany where the Thruway changes from being Interstate 87 to being Interstate 90. The Thruway then parallels Washington Avenue Ext as it leaves the city one last time. =Interstate 90= Interstate 90 enters the City of Albany in its western panhandle, as a toll road, the New York State Thruway. However, soon after entering the city limits, the Thruway switches onto Interstate 87, with I-90 becoming a six-lane freeway. This portion of I-90 runs through the north side of Albany, near its border with the neighboring town of Colonie. The highway provides access to SUNY Albany's Uptown Campus (via interchanges with Fuller Road and Washington Avenue), as well as a direct connection to the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus. Meanwhile, just east of the state office campus interchange, I-90 represents the northern terminus of the Crosstown Arterial (signed as New York State Route 85). Moving further east, I-90 provides indirect access to Central Avenue via the Everett Road exit, a direct connection to the Corporate Woods office park, and closer to downtown, interchanges with the truncated Mid-Crosstown Arterial (signed as U.S. Route 9) with access to Loudonville to the north and the Arbor Hill neighborhood of Albany. Finally, I-90 meets I-787, which passes through Downtown Albany to the south and the village of Menands to the north, before crossing the Hudson River and moving into Rensselaer County. =Interstate 787= Interstate 787 connects the Thruway with downtown Albany and also connects Albany with points north in Albany County, such as Watervliet, Green Island, and Cohoes. Exits 2, 3(a and b), 4 (a and b), and 5 are within the city. The first stretch was constructed in the 1960s. =Crosstown Arterial= The Crosstown Arterial, signed as New York State Route 85, is a four-lane divided highway serving western sections of Albany, particularly the Buckingham Lake and Campus neighborhoods. Although Route 85 signed as a west- to-east route, the Crosstown Arterial portion generally moves from northeast to southwest while in the City of Albany. The arterial begins at Route 85's eastern terminus, an interchange with Interstate 90. The westbound side of the Crosstown Arterial has interchanges with Washington Avenue, the State Office Campus, Daytona Avenue (providing access to US 20/Western Avenue), and Krumkill Road. Beyond Krumkill Road just prior to crossing the NYS Thruway, the Crosstown Arterial enters the town of Bethlehem, and in that town changes from a limited access highway to a two-lane surface street, referred to as the Slingerlands Bypass. On the eastbound side, the Crosstown Arterial has slightly different exits, sharing the Krumkill Road and State Office Campus interchanges, but providing access to US 20 via Ormond Street, and lacking a Washington Avenue interchange. Instead, the final exit on the eastbound side of the Crosstown Arterial before its terminus at I-90 is an interchange with Lincoln Avenue, a surface road which terminates at the arterial. The Lincoln Avenue exit allows access to Washington Avenue via Colvin Avenue, and various side street. =Northway/Fuller Road Alternate= The Northway, the part of Interstate 87 (I-87) north of the New York State Thruway, was built in segments, which became I-87 as they were completed and linked to the pre- existing route. Construction began in the late 1950s on the portion of the Northway between the Thruway and NY 7 near Latham. This segment was open to traffic by 1960. Fuller Road Alternate, the lone portion of the Adirondack Northway not part of I-87, was originally intended to be part of the Southern Albany Expressway, a proposed highway which would have connected the Northway to Interstate 787 and run parallel to the Thruway between exits 23 and 24. Exit 1 of the Northway is the only exit on the highway that is within Albany, it connects the highway to Interstate 90 (I-90). The highway connects Albany to the suburbs to the north such as Latham, and Clifton Park; the resorts of Saratoga Springs and Lake George; and on to Plattsburgh and Montreal. =South Mall Expressway= The South Mall Expressway connects S. Swan Street with Interstate 787, and goes underneath the Empire State Plaza. See also *History of Albany, New York *Neighborhoods of Albany, New York References Further reading * Joel Munsell (1869).

Proponents claim that these effects include congenital abnormality, cancer, and death. The distribution of recorded events, however, correlates with media coverage of wind farm syndrome itself, and not with the presence or absence of wind farms. Neither term is recognised by any international disease classification system, nor do they appear in any title or abstract in the United States National Library of Medicine's PubMed database. Wind turbine syndrome has been characterized as pseudoscience. The Center for Media and Democracy's SourceWatch website has identified at least one Australian fossil fuel industry funded astroturfing group, the Waubra Foundation, as involved in promoting the idea of wind turbine syndrome. An investigation led to the foundation being stripped of its status as a health promotion charity. Safety reviews Since 2003, 25 reviews have been published of the scientific literature on wind turbines and health. These studies have consistently found no reason to believe that wind turbines are harmful to health. A 2009 Canadian study found that \\"a small minority of those exposed report annoyance and stress associated with noise perception...\\" [however] \\"Annoyance is not a disease.\\" The study group pointed out that similar irritations are produced by local and highway vehicles, as well as from industrial operations and aircraft. A 2011 literature review found that although wind turbines are associated with some health effects, such as sleep disturbance, the health effects reported by those living near wind turbines were probably caused not by the turbines themselves but rather by \\"physical manifestation from an annoyed state.\\" A 2013 report for the National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) elaborated: \\"There is consistent evidence that noise from wind turbines is associated with annoyance, and reasonable consistency that it is associated with sleep disturbance and poorer sleep quality and quality of life. However, it is unclear whether the observed associations are due to wind turbine noise or plausible confounders.\\" A meta study published in 2014 reported that among the cross-sectional studies of better quality, no clear or consistent association is seen between wind turbine noise and any reported disease or other indicator of harm to human health. Noise from turbines played a minor role in comparison with other factors in leading people to report annoyance in the context of wind turbines. In early 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested a false conspiracy that the noise from windmills may cause cancer, resulting in backlash against his claim from politicians across the spectrum, such as Iowa Senators, Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley. Policy impact In Ontario, Canada, the Ministry of the Environment created noise guidelines to limit wind turbine noise levels 30 metres away from a dwelling or campsite to 40 dB(A).Ministry of the Environment, Ontario (October 2008) \\"Noise Guidelines for Wind Farms\\" These regulations also set a minimum distance of for a group of up to five relatively quiet [102 dB(A)] turbines within a radius, rising to for a group of 11 to 25 noisier (106-107 dB(A)) turbines. Larger facilities and noisier turbines would require a noise study. In a 2009 report about rural wind farms, a Standing Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales, Australia, recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses (which can be waived by the affected neighbour) as a precautionary approach. Despite the lack of scientific literature demonstrating any health effects from wind turbines, Australia's Turnbull government appointed a wind farm commissioner in October 2015 to address complaints. The 2016 annual report of the Independent Scientific Committee on Wind Turbines was tabled in the Australian Parliament on 8 August 2017. A website is maintained for the National Wind Farm Commissioner, with information about the role's purpose and links to a variety of publications that address wind turbines and their management, from a range of national and international sources. Noise mitigation Modern wind turbines produce significantly less noise than older designs. Turbine designers work to minimise noise, as noise reflects lost energy and output. Noise levels at nearby residences may be managed through the siting of turbines, the approvals process for wind farms, and operational management of the wind farm.

This in-turn will enhance the basic attitude of the individual; and that will reflect the general level of performance in workplace. Studies indicate that many people who have difficulty in obtaining or holding a job possess the needed technical competence but lack interpersonal competence. Lawrence A.

Developing Executive Skills, American Management Association, NY. Lack of people skills among upper echelons (top management) can result in bullying and/or harassment, which is not uncommon in the modern workplace due to changing values. The causes that are most identified with the situation are lack of necessary motivation, communication, influencing skills and empathy gap among upper echelons (Gilbert and Thompson, 2002). Training company staff in people skills and interpersonal skills increases the morale and dignity at work (Best, 2010). Employers that do not take steps to prevent harassment can face major costs in decreased productivity, low morale, increased absenteeism and health care costs, and potential legal expenses.

In 1966, JCPenney was constructed and the mall was enclosed for a grand opening on June 8, 1967. In 1979, another expansion was completed by Crown American with the construction of Hess's department store.

The first phase beginning in 1995 started with a new store, Kaufmann's, which was added to the far end of the mall to replace Hess's. The already built, undamaged two-story portion of the mall was renovated, and these renovations included changeovers such as the re- branding of Wall To Wall Sound & Video to The Wall and temporary relocation of restaurants such as Wong's Wok. Another phase one project was the construction of a new two-story section to replace the portion damaged by the fire. Phase two consisted of opening a new three-story parking garage and a new eight- screen Carmike Cinema. Phase three was completed in 1997 and included the openings of a new larger JCPenney location closer to Sears. Following this opening, a new food court opened in the renovated second floor of the former JCPenney store, which allowed for more stores in the old two-story section. Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PREIT) acquired the mall in 2003 as part of its merger with Crown American. The May Department Stores Company, which owned Kaufmann's, was sold to Federated Department Stores in 2005. Federated proceeded to convert various May properties to Macy's, including the Logan Valley Mall store. In 2017, the Carmike Cinema was re-branded AMC Classic following AMC's acquisition of the Carmike chain. Also in 2017, the mall was sold to Mason Asset Management and Namdar Realty Group.

Willis in 1981 Winston Earl Willis (born October 21, 1939) is a former American real estate developer who established his business in Cleveland, Ohio during the early 1960s. He created University Circle Properties Development, Inc. (UCPD, Inc.), which owned real estate parcels in Cleveland and was the largest employer of black people in that part of the country. Under UCPD at East 105th and Euclid, upwards of 23 businesses operated simultaneously. In the 1970s and 80s Willis ran afoul of tax and other laws and lost his properties to seizure in 1983. His ongoing legal battles with the city of Cleveland over ownership of his lands spans several decades, including his 2007 petition to the U.S. Supreme Court. Early life Winston, Age 9 Willis was born in Montgomery, Alabama, the third of the five children of Clarence C. Willis and his wife, Alberta Frazier Willis, both natives of Montgomery. The Willis children attended St. Jude Educational Institute at the City of St. Jude. In the fall of 1954, when Winston was 14, the Willis family settled in Detroit. Winston's father's years of experience as a carpet installer for the Montgomery Fair department store enabled him to find suitable employment and settle his family into a quiet neighborhood on the West side near Dearborn. There, Winston created, published and delivered his own neighborhood advertising newspaper, the Western Detroit Shopping News. His high school career at Chadsey High School was uneventful ‚Äì and brief. First business ventures He sold Collier's Encyclopedias door-to-door, a venture that resulted in his arrest for loitering in affluent white neighborhoods. His knowledge of the floor covering trade, which he learned at his father‚Äôs side, led to his hiring by a Detroit retail tile store, where he advanced to manager. His plan was to head for Hollywood, where he intended to become the first successful black movie producer. Before setting out on that odyssey with a neighborhood friend, he took a brief trip to Cleveland in 1958 for a short visit with relatives at his mother‚Äôs insistence. After arriving, Willis went on a four-day spree playing One-Pocket, a billiards game, and won several thousand dollars. He decided to stay a few weeks, playing more games to finance the planned trip to the West coast. He reconsidered that plan and decided to postpone the trip. The 19-year-old Willis leased a building that was previously an automobile showroom and opened The Jazz Temple, a liquor- free coffeehouse and night club, to immediate success. Willis approached such legendary jazz artists as Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, Herbie Hancock, Cannonball Adderley, The Ramsey Lewis Trio, and Dinah Washington and convinced them to come to Cleveland to appear at his club. The trendy establishment also attracted visits from Malcolm X, and Stokely Carmichael and performances from other notables, such as comedians Redd Foxx, Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor and Dick Gregory. The night spot became popular with college students, and the clientele included interracial couples, which triggered resentment and threats from the racially polarized community. A bomb was planted in the club, and Willis closed the business a few weeks later.Call and Post ‚ÄúBelieve Racial Bigots Behind Jazz Temple Bombing‚Äù (August 17, 1963) Pg. 1-A He launched another venture, the Hot Potato Restaurant, on Cleveland‚Äôs lower East side. The small restaurant enabled him to finance his next business. Building an empire Willis hoped to revitalize a large parcel of land encompassing the old Doan‚Äôs Corner at East 105th Street and Euclid Avenue, site of the Keith's East 105th Theater where comedian Bob Hope got his start in vaudeville. The area had deteriorated following the Hough Riots of 1966 and the Glenville Shootout of 1968. Those events accelerated white flight from historically polarized Cleveland communities, affecting businesses on Euclid Avenue, which suffered rapidly dwindling patronage. After a long and contentious legal struggle with the former titleholder, The Cleveland Trust Company, Willis bought the property, which was flanked on either side by University Circle and the Cleveland Clinic. Willis opened and operated numerous businesses on the Euclid Avenue strip. He established University Circle Properties Development, Inc. (UCPD, Inc.), a commercial property development corporation, to manage the stores and shops. The businesses included restaurants, movie theaters, clothing stores, taverns, a food market, a check cashing store, a penny arcade, a state liquor store, and an adult book store. At one time there were 28 businesses in operation, employing over 400 people. A 1973 Cleveland Press newspaper article heralded the strip in a cover story entitled: ‚ÄúWinston Willis‚Äô Miracle on East 105th Street‚Ä¶‚Äù. Legal troubles In 1975 Willis was convicted of failing to pay city income taxes. In 1979 a police raid found drugs and gambling equipment at Winston's Place. By 1980 he was found guilty of more tax violations and accused of owing thousands of dollars on water and sewer bills.\\"Jazzed in Cleveland Part 137 - The Jazz Temple\\". Retrieved March 27, 2017 Willis alleged that he was being harassed by the city and that his properties were targeted for excessive inspections by the fire department. The fire inspections gained the notoriety of a sporting event; they were unscheduled, unannounced and routinely happened at the height of business hours when the restaurants and movie theaters and other businesses were teeming with customers. Newspaper publisher W.O. Walker‚Äôs Call & Post ran an editorial sympathetic to Willis, \\"Fire Inspections as Weapons\\": Fight with the city The property Willis owned occupied an area the city wanted for a large medical-educational complex connecting Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals, and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Willis fought the city with lawsuits, as reported in the local press, \\"Willis, who has made a battleground of the courts in his fight‚Ä¶ is on the legal rampage again.\\" Other headlines followed, such as \\"Willis Alleges Land Squeeze In Area Around E. 105 and Euclid\\". A July 13, 1977 front page Plain Dealer article reported: \\"Cleveland businessman, Winston E. Willis yesterday filed a $100 million dollar lawsuit charging that the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, University Circle Inc.,(UCI) and others are monopolizing real estate and violating antitrust laws. Willis, who owns a strip of shops and offices on Euclid Avenue between E. 105th and E. 107th Streets, said he and his tenants are being forced out of business.\\" Numerous lawsuits Willis filed in the local Federal District Court and the Ohio Court of Common Pleas in defense of his holdings were dismissed. The billboards In his battle with the city, Willis erected a large billboard on the side of his building overlooking Euclid Avenue, the main thoroughfare for suburban commuters to Cleveland‚Äôs downtown financial center. He used the billboard to criticize what he believed was corruption and cronyism among Cuyahoga County officials, the local judiciary, and philanthropic institutions, and what he believed was rampant racism in the community. Community Billboards The \\"community billboard,\\" as it came to be known, was soon a featured neighborhood attraction for residents and patrons of the numerous Willis business outlets on Euclid Avenue. Willis used the billboard to express his moral outrage and changed the text every two weeks. The signage was considered \\"an embarrassment\\" to the establishment elite and the staid University Circle area. Call & Post publisher and well-respected force in the black community, W.O. Walker, gave Willis a dire warning: \\"Take those billboards down, son. These white people will crucify you.\\" Walker also attempted to use his considerable influence to convince the city‚Äôs redevelopment planners that black businessmen should not be shut out of their plan, but he was unsuccessful.OHIO Magazine, W.O. Walker-Cleveland's Black Power Broker, February 1981, p.57 Rumblings of \\"take back the block\\" reached City Hall and council meetings. Carl B. Stokes), the city's first African-American mayor, resisted takeover attempts that came to his attention.Stokes, Carl B., (1973). Promises of Power: A Political Autobiography, Simon & Schuster Wrecking ball Accused of having written a $421 bad check to a local lumber company, he was indicted by a grand jury and arrested on the charge that was later proven to be false. During his imprisonment at a Chillicothe, Ohio, correctional facility he was held in solitary confinement for ten days without access to his attorneys while the taking and immediate demolition of all of his Euclid Avenue properties was executed. The entirety of these lands, buildings and business holdings were taken without payment of just compensation. After being released from prison Willis filed a legal complaint and sought the assistance of Professor Spencer NethSpencer Neth, Professor Case Western University School of Law of Case Western Reserve University School of Law, who is an expert in the field of commercial transactions. Professor Neth concluded and stated in his written expert opinion that the check had been paid, ‚Äúthe transaction was closed‚Äù and there should not have been an indictment, trial or conviction. The judge hearing the case refused to allow him to present his findings. With Willis isolated in solitary confinement away in Chillicothe, Ohio, his Euclid Avenue business compound and buildings were cordoned off and surrounded by huge numbers of the Cleveland police department, and S.W.A.T. teams. During the entirety of the 10 days of his incarceration/isolation, members of the police department‚Äôs Intelligence unit kept the entire complex surrounded on an around-the-clock basis. Unmarked police cars were stationed at each intersection leading to and from the area. As reported by numerous eyewitnesses at the scene, ‚Äúthe wrecking ball swung quickly and unmercifully‚Äù, flattening tall, multi-story brick buildings into a barren empty dirt lot. Within a few days, not a trace of the Willis/UCPD,Inc. business empire remained. Winston E. Willis Willis maintains that the historic pattern of land takings from blacks in this country is a continuation of slavery. Recent years After decades in Cleveland courtrooms fighting to defend and protect his property rights, Willis has become somewhat of a legal scholar, living a quiet life in the shadow of his former empire, far removed from the life he once lived. Since the massive destruction of his large business empire in 1982, one singular obsession has occupied his mind to the exclusion of all else: ‚ÄúPayment for my lands and my federally guaranteed relocation benefits.‚Äù Most recently in his ongoing quest, he successfully prepared a Petition for Writ of Mandamus to the United States Supreme Court. His petition was accepted and docketed. A short time later however, he received word of the high Court‚Äôs denial. But rather than surrender to defeat and become another sad statistic among fellow African-American land theft victims, he continues to fight for his constitutionally guaranteed property rights. As noted in the reporting of hundreds of other cases documented in the 2001 Associated Press series Torn From The Land, \\"‚Ä¶ these property thefts are just the tip of one of the biggest crimes of this country's history.\\" ‚Äì Dr. Raymond Winbush, scholar/activist, director of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University. Willis maintains that the historic pattern of land takings from blacks in this country is a continuation of slavery. \\"To deny a person their right to own property is a form of slavery. I am a slave without bondage.\\" References * Depke, John E. (August 26, 1971). ‚ÄúPorno King‚Äôs Empire Grows Fast‚Äù The Plain Dealer Front Page Headline. * Hughley, Emanuel, Jr., McLaughlin, Dick.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Liverpool South Childwall, the archdeaconry of Liverpool, and the diocese of Liverpool. Its benefice is united with those of Christ Church, Netherley, and St Mark, Childwall Valley, to form the Gateacre Team. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built between 1872 and 1874, and designed by the local architect Cornelius Sherlock. The foundation stone was laid on 1 April 1872, and the church was consecrated on 11 February 1874 by the bishop of Chester. Originally it was a chapel of ease to All Saints, Childwall, and became a separate parish in 1893. A south vestry was added to the church in 1897. Architecture =Exterior= St Stephen's is constructed in rock- faced sandstone with ashlar dressings, and has a slate roof with a tiled ridge. It is designed in the architectural style of about 1300. The plan of the church consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles under lean-to roofs, a south porch, a chancel with north and south vestries, and a northwest steeple. The tower has angle buttresses rising to crocketed gables. It has a west entrance, and on the west face are paired lancet windows flanking a niche containing a statue. At the top of the tower is a frieze and an embattled parapet with gargoyles. There are lucarnes on the spire. The windows along the sides of the aisles have two or three lights with cusped ogee heads. Along the clerestory are rose windows. The west window has four lights, the east window has three, and the windows in the vestries have two lights. =Interior= Inside the church are five-bay arcades carried on round columns. The roof of the nave is scissor-braced, and that of the chancel is coffered. The stained glass in the west window, dating from 1883, was designed by Edward Burne-Jones and coloured by William Morris and attributed to Morris & Co., and that in the east window, dated 1880, is by Frederick Preedy. The maker of the two-manual pipe organ is not known. It was cleaned and repaired in about 1900 by Gray and Davison. The organ was repaired again in 1939 by Rushworth and Dreaper. However, it needed major repairs in the 1990s and was modernized with poor electronic components.

The group has seven members and currently performs in churches and other venues in Richmond and along the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States. Background Originator James \\"Leon\\" Lewis says the group came together in the late 1990s when he was singing, a cappella, in the locker room at the post office in Richmond, and a co-worker a few lockers over picked up the tune. Soon other co-workers would join the group during work breaks or after hours, providing new harmonies. The group has now grown to seven and includes Lewis (leads), Alton Jones, Michael Ellis, Robert \\"Doc\\" Dockery (bass),Lewis Hatcher (leads and falsetto), Brandon Lewis and L.J. Lewis. Brandon and L.J. are Leon Lewis' sons. Musical career Landmark Theater, Richmond, Virginia The group generally performs at weddings, reunions and churches local to the Richmond area. In August 2004, the Spiritual Harmonizers entered \\"the Gospel Explosion Showcase\\" at the Landmark Theater in Richmond, and won the grand prize by finishing first. In 2006 the group performed in Washington, D.C., at the investiture of Yverne Pat Moore, the first black Postmaster of Washington, D.C. They have performed at the same venues with other gospel acts such as Yolanda Adams and Luther Barnes. In July 2009, The Spiritual Harmonizers impressed the judges of America's Got Talent (season 4) with their a cappella rendition of the Boyz II Men hit \\"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\\". Although the judges ostensibly passed the group \\"on to the next round\\", they were cut from the show and sent home without any other performances on the July 28, 2009 episode. The YouTube video of their performance got more than 20,000 hits within a week after the show. The group recorded a CD in 2000 called Up in Faith and plans to release a second in 2009 featuring its America's Got Talent success. Demand for the groups's appearances has also increased ten-fold since their television appearance. On September 13, 2009, between 5pm and 11pm PST, the Spiritual Harmonizers sang live during the Chabad Telethon in Los Angeles, California. The telethon was seen by an international audience of more than 2 million people.

Lorc√°n ruled in as King of Mide from 862-864\\\\. His exact dynastic affiliations are unknown. The death of a certain Cathal mac Conchobair is mentioned in the annals in 843.Annals of Ulster AU 843.2 If this was his father he may have been the grandson of the High King Conchobar mac Donnchada (died 833). Upon the death of M√°el Ruanaid mac Donnchada Midi of Mide in 843, a succession dispute broke out. Whether the mention of Cathals's death in that year by the annals implies that Cathal died as part of this dispute or was the heir (he would have been senior in the clan at that time) and his death led to the dispute, is not mentioned. Lorc√°n did succeed to the throne himself in 862 possibly as senior heir. The new High King was √Åed Findliath (died 877) of the northern U√≠ N√©ill kindred of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain. He however met much resistance from members of the southern U√≠ N√©ill. Lorc√°n mac Cathail, allied himself with Amlaib, √çmar and Auisle (the leaders of the Norse) against Flann mac Conaing of Brega. Flann was a former ally of Dublin, and still √Åed's most important ally in the central part of Ireland. Lorc√°n and his Norse allies plundered Brega in 863, and in 864 Conchobar mac Donnchada, (called the other king of Mide) presumably an ally of Flann against Lorc√°n, was captured and drowned near Clonard on Amlaibhs order. √Åed led an host to M√≠de, captured Lorc√°n and blinded him.Annals of Ulster AU 863.4, 864.1, 864.2 As a result, Lorc√°n had to abdicate. It is not known when he died. One of his sons, who is unnamed, is mentioned as being responsible for the killing of the heir of the high king Flann Sinna in 901.Annals of Ulster AU 901.1 In connection with this event the historian Charles-Edwards advances the theory that Lorc√°n was actually a member of the Luigne tribe as his son is called one of the kings of Luigne. If so, then the theory is that Lorc√°n was appointed as the representative of M√°el Sechnaill mac Ma√≠l Ruanaid to administer Mide while he was high king.Charles- Edwards, pg. 480 However the Annals of the Four Masters do not refer to him as king of luigne but as the son of the King of Mide. This theory could explain why Conchobar mac Donnchada was called the other king of Mide in the notice of his drowning by the Vikings in 864. He may have been the rightful heir to Mide but his dynastic association with the Clann Cholm√°in is also uncertain Notes References * Charles-Edwards, T. M.

Originally from Bantry Bay in the south of Ireland, modern County Cork, she was an anchorite ; living in solitude in a self-imposed spiritual exile from society. Nearing the end of her life, she had a vision of all the monasteries in Ireland, and, extending from each upwards to the Heavens, was a pillar of fire. The fire-pillar from Saint Sen√°n mac Geircinn‚Äôs monastery at Inis Cathaig, in the mouth of the Shannon River, was the highest, and the straightest towards Heaven ; and Conaire set off in its direction, judging it to be the most holy. \\"Let me be buried on this most holiest of islands,\\" related Conaire, to God, \\"for it is there that I wish my re-incarnation to be.\\" She set off on her journey, weakened by the effects of advanced age, but driven by determination and faith, walking the whole way to County Clare, and across to the island called Inis Cathaig in Irish. When she arrived at Saint Senan‚Äôs monastery, he and his brother monks refused her admittance. Senan offered that she should go stay with a kinswoman of his. Although there were many monasteries throughout Ireland at that time which allowed both men and women, Senan and his brother monks believed that their chastity vows prohibited all contact with women. \\"Christ came to redeem women no less than to redeem men. No less did he suffer for the sake of women than for the sake of men. No less than men, women enter into the heavenly kingdom. Why, then, should you not allow women to live on this place?\\" [2] reasoned Conaire to Senan ; but he would not forsake his extremist chastity vows, even for the holy Conaire. \\"Well then here I will stay on this shore of Inis Cathaig until my demise,\\" proclaimed Conaire. \\"But, the waves will wash away your grave !\\" exclaimed an exasperated Senan. \\"Leave that to God.\\" said Conaire, and, after a victory over the world and the devil, she died. Her grave is today marked by a simple flag off the coast of Scattery Island, though her true home is in Heaven. Saint Conaire is an early feminist icon of the Irish church, and the patron saint of sailors and fisherman, particularly on the West Coast of Ireland, where seagoing ships still make a stop at Inis Cathaig to collect a stone in honour of Conaire to protect them on their voyage. The monastery at Scattery Island is still for men only. She is the namesake of the ancient Irish bardic family √ì Maolconaire of Roscommon (Descendant of the Servant of Saint Conaire) who were Priomhseanachie na h√âireann, or the Antiquaries to the Kings, in Gaelic Ireland, and ran numerous schools of traditional poetry, history, and law throughout Ireland, and also of Saint Canera Catholic Church, in Neosho, Missouri.

His body of published recorded work spans from 1980 to the present day. Bonin was born in Hammersmith, London and grew up in north London. He began playing bass in north London punk band \\"The Shit\\", the only band to play at the National Union of Students rally in Hyde Park in front of a crowd of 5000 in March 1979. Bonin played bass in The Jetset, recording and touring with the band from 1980‚Äì82. During this time, Bonin worked for media mogul Clive Banks at his Parker Street offices, taking over the office boy's job from Gary Crowley, where several well-known bands (The Pretenders, Elvis Costello, The Stranglers, Bob Geldof) were based. After moving to Berlin in 1986, he founded the street-punk band \\"The Magoo Brothers\\". Before their demise in 1989, the band had toured all over Europe, playing over 400 concerts in the process. They released the album, Beyond Believable, in 1988 on the German Bouncing Corporation label and published by Constrictor. Bonin followed this by forays into the newly independent Eastern European states, playing to a TV audience of 250 million at the Jurmala Festival in Riga, Latvia in 1992 , as well as at the Ukrainian national Festival Maria later that year. Bonin also supported Marc Almond at the Sopot Festival in 1993. He was offered a place at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA) in 1996. This was also the year he began a 15-year performing career on stage at the Deutsche Oper (German National Opera) in Berlin, taking on a variety of roles including M. Guillot in Tschaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. Record releases followed throughout the late 1990s with his band \\"King Bastard\\" which featured the legendary Tex Morton on guitar. Their song \\"Time on my Hands\\" was featured in Leander Hau√ümann's film of Sven Regener's novel \\"Herr Lehmann\\". Bonin teamed up with Regener in 2001, singing backing vocals on the Element of Crime album Romantik. Bonin has continued to write, many of his songs appearing in films and television. He signed to Universal in 2004 as a songwriter in his own right. During a period arranging and co-producing with Moses Schneider (Beatsteaks, Tocotronic), and writing with Christian Geller (Banaroo, No Angels), Vanessa Petruo and Apocalyptica, Bonin also found time to tour and write with Ben Hamilton and The Say Highs, playing supports for The Sea and Cake, Jack Pe√±ate and Kula Shaker, among others. He has continued to play live and record since then and is now preparing his new bands, The Chosen Few, and The Wildfires for action. The Wildfires released their debut album One on Amazing Records (Europe) at the end of 2013, produced by David Young. They are currently residing in Berlin and touring throughout Europe. Bonin's career branched out into the field of acting in May 2016 when he took on the role of 'Wally' in Volker Schl√∂ndorff's filming of Return to Montauk. The film was released in May 2017. Bonin's mastery of the German language also became evident with the publication of his English translation of the autobiography of Edgar Froese which was published in September 2017.

From 1930 to 1943, by virtue of seniority, Bergen was also the doyen of the diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See. This office entitled him to speak at the funeral of Pope Pius XI in 1939, when he infamously urged the cardinals to elect a new pope who would work with the fascist governments of Europe to build \\"a new world upon the ruins of a past that in many things has no longer any reason to exist\\". Bergen was recalled in 1943, aged more than seventy, which was a good deal more than the mandatory retirement age for German diplomats, and was replaced by Ernst von Weizs√§cker. Early life Diego von Bergen was born in Siam in 1872, the son of a German diplomat, Werner von Bergen, and a Spanish mother, Isabel Maria de las Mercedes Alcala. The young Bergen attended a Roman Catholic school in Ro√üleben and then the University of Berlin. He first entered the German diplomatic corps in 1895 as legation secretary at Peking, remaining in China during the Boxer Rebellion. He also held diplomatic posts in Brussels and Madrid before going to Rome. According to a New York Times obituary, \\"a man of considerable culture, a fluent linguist, he was said to have never been in sympathy with the Weimar Republic and to have been an early adherent to the National Socialist Regime.\\" Ambassador to the Holy See Bergen was first accredited to the Holy See in 1915 as a Minister from the Kingdom of Prussia, then the largest state of the German Empire. On April 1, 1919, Matthias Erzberger persuaded the new German Republic to \\"restore the Prussian legation to the Holy See\\", the only diplomatic appointment that year.Scholder, 1987, p. 60. Bergen was a friend of Erzberger's in the Foreign Office. On September 27, the Foreign Minister Hermann M√ºller informed the Reichstag Committee on Foreign Affairs of the establishment of a German embassy to the Vatican. The takeover of the legation had been requested by Prussia and attained the concurrence of the Curia. According to Scholder, \\"thus the transformation of the Prussian legation into an embassy of the Reich as had happened once before, in 1871, had probably been envisaged from the start\\". Bergen was announced as German ambassador to the Vatican on April 24, 1920.New York Times. 1920, April 24. \\"German Ambassador to the Vatican\\". p. 2. Erzberger was an advocate of a concordat between Germany and the Holy See, and announced his intentions at an end-of- year banquet in honor of the nuncio; Erzberger advocated negotiations to be conducted by all the States of Germany in concert, \\"under the leadership of the Reich\\". Bavarian Nuncio Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII) preferred to conclude a separate concordat with Bavaria, and Joseph Wirth instructed Bergen to \\"work for a change in the Nuncio's position. But this was just as futile as all other attempts to change the Nuncio's mind on this point\\".Scholder, 1987, p. 66. Bergen twice refused the office of Foreign Minister of Germany because he preferred to stay in Rome.Chadwick, 1988, p. 1. He became the senior ambassador in Rome in 1930, and thus was the doyen of the diplomatic corps. Bergen's counsellor, Menschausen, would act on his behalf when he was ill.Chadwick, 1988, p. 144. Menschausen was also named charg√© d'affaires after Bergen was temporarily withdrawn on June 2, 1937 (this move was echoed by the temporary withdrawing of Cesare Orsenigo, nuncio to Berlin, and replacing him with a charg√© d'affaires) after American Cardinal George Mundelein had spoken publicly against Hitler.New York Times. 1937, June 2. \\"Rift with Vatican is Opened by Reich\\". p. 1.

Before the papal conclave, 1939, Bergen communicated with Pacelli, who related to him his preference for conciliation towards Nazi Germany.Chadwick, 1988, p. 45. The four German cardinals decided to vote for Pacelli as the new Pope unless contrary orders reached Bergen by 28 February. Both Karl Joseph Schulte and Michael von Faulhaber promised as much to Bergen, who was confident that Adolf Bertram would follow their lead but unsure about what course of action Theodor Innitzer would undertake. Pacelli was elected, taking the name Pius XII, and Bergen met the newly elected pope on March 5, three days after the end of the conclave.Blet, 1999, p. 53. =Second World War= Bergen's counterpart in Berlin, Cesare Orsenigo (pictured with Hitler and Ribbentrop), was also doyen of the diplomatic corps. On March 8, 1940, Bergen appeared in the Vatican for the first time in months to arrange an audience between Pius XII and Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop; Bergen was successful in this, and the meeting took place on March 11.Blet, 1999, pp. 35-36.Camile M. Cianfarra. 1939, March 9. \\"Pope Pius Confers with Reich Envoy\\". New York Times. p. 1. At the meeting, Ribbentrop offered to allow Cardinal August Hlond to return to Poland, which the New York Times reported as \\"the nearest approach to a temporal power's 'going to Canossa' that has been seen in recent times.\\"Herbert L. Matthews. 1940, March 12. \\"Nazi Conciliatory\\". p. 1. The hour and five minute audience was reportedly of \\"an unprecedented length\\", and was followed by a forty-five- minute meeting with the new Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione, rather than the usual courtesy call with the Secretary. Maglione proceeded immediately afterwards to report to the pope. On January 13, 1940, the New York Times reported that Bergen had been \\"transferred\\" and that Franz von Papen (a former Catholic Centre Party chancellor of Germany) had been put forward as a replacement, although the paper believed that \\"there are good reasons to believe that Herr von Papen would not be a persona grata\\".New York Times. 1940, January 13. \\"Inquiry on Papen Denied\\". p. 2.

When the pope received \\"many thousands\\" of holiday greetings that year, Bergen was accorded the honor of being the first to meet the pope.New York Times. 1940, December 28. \\"Holiday Greetings Pour into Vatican\\". p. 4. Bergen also demanded on August 29, 1941 that \\"all ecclesiastical appointments to important posts in annexed or occupied regions be first communicated to Berlin\\".Blet, 1999, p. 73. Bergen also was able to relay German complaints about Vatican Radio and obtained an assurancewhich angered the Britishthat the station would stay away from politics.Chadwick, 1988, p. 148. Bergen also assured his superiors in Berlin that the pope would not publicly condemn Nazi persecution and that \\"the pope's heart, they tell me, is always on the side of the Axis\\".Chadwick, 1988, p. 196. Bergen occasionally relayed threats from Ribbentrop to the pope, but replied that \\"Pacelli is no more sensible to threats than we are\\".Chadwick, 1988, p. 218. Bergen asked Pope Pius XII to prevent the bombing of Rome in September 1942, without asking or even informing his superiors in Berlin.Chadwick, 1988, p. 233. Pius XII drew Bergen aside after his 1942 Christmas address and assured him that his criticisms were aimed at Stalin and Russianot Germany.Phayer, 2008, p. 63. =Recall= von Bergen's successor as ambassador, Ernst von Weizs√§cker Bergen was not viewed as sufficiently pro-Nazi and was marginalized for years before being forced from his post in 1943. He was recalled to Berlin on February 27, 1943, \\"for consultation\\", reportedly to protest against the Pope's \\"frivolous attitude\\" toward mediating the end of the war.Daniel T. Brigham. 1943, February 27. \\"Germany Recalls Envoy to Vatican\\". New York Times. p. 17. Von Bergen was well past the official age limit for retirement at the time of his recall. In 1943, Bergen was replaced as ambassador by Ernst von Weizs√§cker, the former secretary of state at the Foreign Office.Blet, 1999, p. 255. Weizs√§cker reported to Berlin after his first meeting with Pius XII that \\"hostility to Bolshevism is, in fact, the most stable component of Vatican foreign policy\\" and that the Vatican \\"detested\\" the link between the US and Soviet Russiaa message echoed by the departed Bergen.Phayer, 2000, p. 59. Death Diego von Bergen died on October 7, 1944, in Wiesbaden, Germany; his death was announced ten days later in L'Osservatore Romano, in an obituary which called him \\"highly esteemed and unanimously liked\\".\\"Diego von Bergen, German Diplomat\\". New York Times. October 18, 1944. p. 21.

His rehabilitative methods have been criticized. Many former patients have sued for abuse. Early life Virgil Miller Newton III (born 1938, Tampa Bay, Florida) was the son of Louisa and Virgil Miller Newton Junior. His father was managing editor of the Tampa Tribune and well known for his fight against secrecy in the government, authoring papers such as ‚ÄúFederal Thought Control a Challenge to American Liberties and Freedom.‚Äù His mother taught Sunday School at their local church, Hyde Park Methodist. During his sophomore year he felt ‚Äúcalled to preach the word of God.‚Äù The Florida Methodist Conference licensed him to preach during his senior year at Sewanee Military Academy. In the summer of 1956, before heading to college he filled in as a student supply pastor in This hometown of Tampa and St Petersburg, FL. From 1956-1957, Newton was appointed state Master Counselor for the Florida chapter of The Order of DeMolay. In the fall of 1956, he began attending Princeton University . After taking a course in religion, Newton in 1957 was contracted to be the lay pastor for the Emlystown circuit in New Jersey, which consisted of 3 churches. Shortly after returning from a ministers conference at Ashbury College, his car lost control and crashed into an oncoming truck, killing a classmate. Newton who had been sleeping in the back seat at the time suffered minor injuries. He stayed in New Jersey over the 1957 summer break to continue his preaching circuit. Newton returned to Florida and recuperated for a year before resuming his studies at the University of Florida, where he obtained a degree in history. During this time, he married and had three children with wife Ruth Ann(n√©e Klink): Joanna (born 1959), Miller (born 1960), and Mark (born 1964). He returned to Princeton University and earned his master's degree. Moving to Indianapolis in late 1963, Newton became the Methodist head pastor of Fletcher Place and subsequently was appointed to the Inter City Association, an organization dedicated to urban poverty issues. During 1964-1965 Newton helped raise money for the black belt region, advocated for an end to token appointments that do not adequately represent the local African American community and protested against the lack of representation of African Americans on the Mayor's poverty board. Newton also created a storefront church he named ‚ÄúOutpost‚Äù in which he held informal meetings to encourage neighborhood political empowerment on urban poverty issues. Following this period Newton moved back to Florida.. The University of Southern Florida in Tampa hired Newton as an associate professor of education where he had both teaching and administrative duties. In 1972 Newton took a leave of absence from the university to campaign for the Democratic nomination for the Florida 5th congressional seat; this was one of three newly created positions. Despite being a prior former president of the Florida Young Democrats he failed to gain the nomination. He was subsequently appointed by Florida Governor Reubin Askew as Pasco Circuit Court Clerk and Clerk to the County Commission. Newton modernized and reorganized the office and in 1974 was reelected to serve out the remaining 2 years of the position. During his term he dealt with several conflicts and in 1975 faced a stripping of power after the County Commission felt he had dabble in policy-making. Newton chose in 1976 not to stand for reelection for the clerk position, but instead tried a second time to win the Democratic nomination for the 5th District congressional seat. After a fierce campaign involving a lawsuit and ethics complaint filed against his opponent JoAnne Saunders, Newton loses the nomination a second time. In 1977, Newton went to work for Gary Smith and Associates and later that year, suffered the loss of his father. In 1979, Newton was named the Executive Director of the Florida Alcohol Coalition. His youngest son Mark developed a drug problem and on September 26, was enrolled in Straight, Inc.. a drug rehabilitation program. At the time, Newton was Executive Director of the Florida Association of Alcohol Treatment Programs. The experience with Mark profoundly affected Newton. Straight program (1980-1983) Four months after enrolling his son, Newton joined Straight, Inc. St Petersburg as Assistant Director. The Straight program was founded in 1976 by wealthy real estate developers Mel Sembler and Joseph Zappa. The average stay was twenty months long, and its corporate goals were \\"to admit 14 clients per month\\". Most clients paid an average of $14,000 for the treatment. In 1980 Newton attended a workshop on alcoholism at the Johnson Institute in Minneapolis. It was during this time he also switched his doctoral focus to teen drug abuse. He defended his doctoral thesis titled \\"The Organization and Implementation of Family Involvement in Adolescent Drug-Use Rehabilitation\\", and graduated in 1981 with a PhD in Public Administration and Urban Anthropology. Newton had obtained directorship of the St Petersburg facility by 1981, and in July 1982, Mel Sembler promoted him to the position of National Director of Straight, Inc. KIDS (1984-2000) =KIDS of Bergen County (1984-1990)= The program had the capacity to treat over 175 youths at a time and the initial fee was $7,200 with an average stay in the program of 12‚Äì14 months. Newton also enrolled sibling groups to prevent brothers and sisters from following in the same destructive lifestyle. A system of peer monitoring enforced his program‚Äôs rules. New youths or youths in the first stages of the program were forbidden to be alone, even to shower or use the bathroom. Newcomers were accompanied everywhere through hand-to-belt looping. Socializing was not allowed, and the youths were isolated from their family and friends. Twice a week, Newton held open meetings in which the families were seated on one side of the room and youths on the other. The purpose of these meeting was for the youths to publicly confess their difficulties, and advancement from the first stage depended upon how revealing their confessions were. The program's counselors were former graduates of the program. In 1984, Newton co-authored Not My Kid: A Parents Guide to Kids and Drugs with TV producer Beth Polson. The book was endorsed by Barbara Walters and was the basis for the 1985 CBS made-for-TV movie Not My Kid, starring Stockard Channing and George Segal, which depicted many of the methods used in Newton's real-life treatment centers. The program would come under legal scrutiny. In 1989 the Bergen County prosecutor's office cited complaints that been made against KIDS since 1985, including the use of restraints that resulted, according to a newspaper report, in \\"blackened eyes, bloody lips, a broken nose and a dislocated elbow.\\" Additionally there were allegations of strip searches, restrictions of sleep and toilet facilities, crowded bedrooms, and lack of schooling. Similar allegations were made regarding Newton's programs in other parts of the country, though Newton denied them, maintaining that the accusations were promulgated by social workers and public officials who had been deceived by drug addicts.3 Youth Treatment Centers Linked by Abuse Accusations. Los Angeles Times, March 24, 1990 In a 1989 interview with ABC Television, Florida state prosecutor David Levin characterized it as \\"....a sort of private jail, utilizing techniques such as torture and punishment which even a convicted criminal would not be subject to.\\" In response Newton said \\"I don't like the word imprison. Imprison implies punishment.\\" Saying he disapproved of violence, Newton said he preferred calling it \\"an isolation ward.\\" =KIDS of North Jersey (1990-1998)= In September 1993, he obtained a clinical psychology doctoral degree, again from Union Institute. His thesis, titled ‚ÄúGuiding Youth Through the Perilous Ordeal‚Äù, was published in 1995. In 1992 three of Newton‚Äôs peer counselors were convicted of assault at KIDS of North Jersey. The presiding Secaucus Municipal Judge, Emil DelBaglivo, called KIDS a ‚Äúhighly questionable‚Äù program. He said something was ‚Äúradically wrong‚Äù if the program director would condone ‚Äúalmost unbelievable‚Äù conduct. KIDS of North Jersey closed on November 2, 1998 and Virgil Miller and Ruth Ann Newton returned to Madeira Beach. In 1998, the state Department of Human Services required Newton to change the program, threatening to cut off Medicaid payments if he did not. The state cited physical restraints and the use of patients as assistants as problems. On May 1, 1998, the state cut off payments. Newton's appeals led to hearings before an Administrative Law judge in late 1998. The judge supported the decision of the state. KIDS of North Jersey closed on November 2, 1998. In 1999, the state alleged $1M in overbillings. =KIDS lawsuits= On February 24, 1987, 14-year-old Rebecca Ehrlich was enrolled in KIDS of Bergen County. She \\"was an obstinate, rebellious teen-ager\\" who had not tried drugs or alcohol. She said she endured physical and emotional abuse until her release in June 1993. Newton said that no one with a professional license had treated her and that such evaluation and subsequent treatment was carried out by \\"peer counselors.\\" Malpractice insurance for Newton, his wife and corporation paid $4.5 million as a result. Without a history of drug abuse, Lulu Corter was treated in KIDS of Bergen County for thirteen years. Corter later won a settlement of $6.5 million.of Bergen County, CBC, The Fifth Estate In 1996, the Federal Government lodged claims against Newton and KIDS for billing the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program for treatment by physicians when the physicians signing the forms had not provided services. Newton did not admit wrongdoing, but agreed to pay back $45,000 for 245 claims.

Gathering insights from an MVP is often less expensive than developing a product with more features, which increases costs and risk if the product fails, for example, due to incorrect assumptions. The term was coined and defined in 2001 by Frank Robinson and then popularized by Steve Blank and Eric Ries.W. S. Junk, \\"The Dynamic Balance Between Cost, Schedule, Features, and Quality in Software Development Projects\\", Computer Science Dept., University of Idaho, SEPM-001, April 2000.Eric Ries, March 23, 2009, Venture Hacks interview: \\"What is the minimum viable product?\\", Lessons LearnedPerfection By Subtraction ‚Äì The Minimum Feature SetHoliday, Ryan The single worst marketing decision you can make The Next Web. 1 April 2015 It may also involve carrying out market analysis beforehand. The MVP is analogous to experimentation in the scientific method applied in the context of validating business hypotheses, it is utilised so that prospective entrepreneurs would know whether a given business idea would actually be viable and profitable by testing the assumptions behind a product or business idea. The concept can be used to validate a market need for a product and for incremental developments of an existing product. As it tests a potential business model to customers to see how the market would react, it is especially useful for new/startup companies who are more concerned with finding out where potential business opportunities exist rather than executing a prefabricated, isolated business model.  Description  A minimum viable product has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product, and no more. Developers typically deploy the product to a subset of possible customers‚Äîsuch as early adopters thought to be more forgiving, more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. This strategy targets avoiding building products that customers do not want and seeks to maximize information about the customer with the least money spent. The technique falls under the Lean Startup methodology as MVPs aim to test business hypotheses and validated learning is one of the five principles of the Lean Startup method. It contrasts strongly with the traditional \\"stealth mode\\" method of product development where businesses make detailed business plans spanning a considerable time horizon. Steve Blank posited that the main principle of the Lean Startup approach rests in validating the hypotheses underlying the product by asking customers if they want the product or if the product meets their needs, and pivoting to another approach if the hypothesis turns out to be false. This approach to validating business ideas cheaply before substantial investment saves costs and limits risk as businesses that upon experimentation turn out to be commercially unfeasible can easily be terminated. It is especially important as the main cause of startup failure is the lack of market need, that is, many startups fail because their product isn't needed by many people, and so they cannot generate enough revenue to recoup the initial investment. Thus it can be said that utilising an MVP would illuminate a prospective entrepreneur on the market demand for their products. An example would help illustrate: in 2015, specialists from the University of Sydney devised the Rippa robot to automate farm and weed management. Before it was released, the underlying hypothesis that the robot's systems can detect weeds from farm plants was tested before the robot project can undergo further development. The application of the MVP method here is that the business hypothesis (that the robot can detect weeds) is tested on a farm, and only if it proves successful will the robot proceed to further development. \\"The minimum viable product is that version of a new product a team uses to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.\\" The definition's use of the words maximum and minimum means it is not formulaic. It requires judgement to figure out, for any given context, what MVP makes sense. Due to this vagueness, the term MVP is commonly used, either deliberately or unwittingly, to refer to a much broader notion ranging from a rather prototype-like product to a fully-fledged and marketable product. An MVP can be part of a strategy and process directed toward making and selling a product to customers. It is a core artifact in an iterative process of idea generation, prototyping, presentation, data collection, analysis and learning. One seeks to minimize the total time spent on an iteration. The process is iterated until a desirable product/market fit is obtained, or until the product is deemed non-viable. Steve Blank typically refers to minimum viable product as minimum feature set. dsd-seaa2016.cs.ucy.ac.cy =Purposes= * Be able to test a product hypothesis with minimal resources * Accelerate learning * Reduce wasted engineering hours * Get the product to early customers as soon as possible * Base for other products * To establish a builder's abilities in crafting the product required * Brand building very quickly = Key MVP elements = An MVP must include these key elements in production quality: * Functionality - the set of features must deliver clear value to the user, * Design - the design of the MVP must be up to the highest industry standard, * Reliability - production quality standard needs to be achieved by rigorous testing, * Usability - the MVP must be easy to use and intuitive, =Testing= * Results from a minimum viable product test aim to indicate if the product should be built to begin with. Testing evaluates if the initial problem or goal is solved in a manner that makes it reasonable to move forward. =Notable quotes= * Steve Blank: \\"You‚Äôre selling the vision and delivering the minimum feature set to visionaries, not everyone.\\" = Marketing = Releasing and assessing the impact of a minimum viable product is a market testing strategy that is used to screen product ideas soon after their generation. In software development, the release is facilitated by rapid application development tools and languages common to web application development. The whole point of MVP is to make quick working project or ready business, cause the average time of development is 1,5 month 1,5 MVP . Using MVP companies can build more accurate market predictions and attract new investments. The MVP differs from the conventional market testing strategy of investing time and money early to implement a product before testing it in the market. The MVP is intended to ensure that the market wants the product before large time and monetary investments are made. The MVP differs from the open source software methodology of release early, release often that listens to users, letting them define the features and future of the product. The MVP starts with a product vision, which is maintained throughout the product life cycle, although it is adapted based on the explicit and implicit (indirect measures) feedback from potential future customers of the product. The MVP is a strategy that may be used as a part of Blank's customer development methodology that focuses on continual product iteration and refinement based on customer feedback. Additionally, the presentation of non-existing products and features may be refined using web-based statistical hypothesis testing, such as A/B testing. =Business Model Canvas= The Business Model Canvas is used to map in the major components and activities for a company starting out. The minimum viable product can be designed by using selected components of the Business Model Canvas: * Customers * Value proposition * Channels * Relationship Emerging applications Concepts from minimum viable product are applied in other aspects of startups and organizations. = Minimum viable brand (MVB) = Using a minimum viable brand (MVB) concept can ensure brand hypotheses are grounded in strategic intent and market insights. =Minimum viable co-founder= Finding other people to create a minimum viable product is a common challenge for new companies and startups. The concept of minimum viable co-founder is based on looking for a co-founder with the following attributes: * Trust * Exceptional at building or selling * Company commitment * Personally likeable * Productivity * Reasonable * Rational * Realistic =Minimum viable team= Founders with an early-stage company are faced with the challenge of building a team with minimal people and cost. The process starts by listing out basic functions of a particular company (e.g., engineer, operations, finance) and then stripping down to the abstract job activities and skills that the company must have to operate.  Criticism  Some research has showed that early release of an MVP may hurt a company more than help when companies risk imitation by a competitor and have not established other barriers to imitation. It has also indicated that negative feedback on an MVP can negatively affect a company's reputation. Many developers of mobile and digital products are now criticizing the MVP because customers can easily switch between competing products through platforms (e.g. app stores). Also, products that do not offer the expected minimum standard of quality are inferior to competitors that enter the market with a higher standard. A notable limitation of the MVP is rooted in its approach that seeks out to test their ideas to the market. Since the business' new product ideas can be inferred from their testing, the method may be unsuited to environments where the protection of intellectual property is limited (and where products are easily imitated). The criticism of the MVP approach has led to several new approaches, e.g. the Minimum Viable Experiment MVE, the Minimum Awesome Product MAP, or the Simple, Lovable, Complete.

A vacuum truck or vacuum tanker is a tank truck that has a pump and a tank. The pump is designed to pneumatically suck liquids, sludges, slurries, or the like from a location (often underground) into the tank of the truck. The objective is to enable transport of the liquid material via road to another location. Vacuum trucks transport the collected material to a treatment or disposal site, for example a sewage treatment plant. A common material to be transport is septage (or more broadly: fecal sludge) which is human excreta mixed with water, e.g. from septic tanks and pit latrines). They also transport sewage sludge, industrial liquids, or slurries from animal waste from livestock facilities with pens. Vacuum trucks can be equipped with a high pressure pump if they are used to clean out sewers from sand.  Other names used  Vacuum tanker used to collect sewage at Tatton Park flower show, July 2009, England Fleet of vacuum trucks used for desludging services by Manila Water in Manila, Philippines Other names used for vacuum trucks: vacuum tanker, \\"Sucker truck\\" (in Australia) or \\"Sewer Sucker\\", \\"Hydro-vac\\", or \\"vac- trucks\\" (in Canada) or \\"Exhauster truck\\" (in Rwanda, Malawi). Slang terms include: \\"honey truck\\", \\"honey sucker\\" (in India and South Africa), and \\"honeywagon\\", all (probably) derived from honey bucket. When a vacuum truck is used to transport fecal sludge then it can also be called \\"fecal sludge truck\\".  Design and configurations  Commercial vacuum trucks which collect fecal sludge usually have a volume of .Strande, L., Ronteltap, M., Brdjanovic, D. (eds.) (2014). Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) book ‚Äì Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation. p. 81. IWA Publishing, UK () However various smaller versions for specialized applications or low-resource settings can be found with tanks as small as . = Pumps = They generally use a low-volume sliding vane pump or a liquid ring pump to create a negative air pressure. The use of diaphragm mud pumps is less common, but with the advantage of a simpler design and usually lower overall costs. The disadvantage is that mechanical parts come into contact with the sludge, which is not the case for the more common vacuum pumps. The truck can be configured to be a direct belt drive, or a hydraulic drive system. There are two different ways to mount the pump: either directly on the truck with the vacuum drive powered by the truck motor, or on the trailer with an independent motor. The second option with the independent motor is more complicated and not commonly used. It has the advantage of potentially having the pump closer to the septic tank. It is also able to use the negative pressure suction side of the pump as well as the positive pressure side to pump sludge over longer distances or lift it higher into the tank. = Suction hoses = The suction hoses are typically 2\\" - 4\\" (or 50mm to 100mm) in diameter with 3\\" (or 75mm) being the norm. The possible length depends on various factors mainly related to the lift and other pressure losses. It is usually impossible to extend it beyond . An inherent suction limitation of all suction pumps is that they can only lift a liquid through utilizing atmospheric pressure. For pure water the theoretical maximum lift is approximately . However, due to the viscosity of fecal sludge it is possible to mix air into it either by sucking close from the surface or by adding air with a compressor through a separate hose. Through this process, the overall density of the sludge/air mixture can be reduced below that of pure water and thus a higher lift () can be reached under optimal conditions. Other factors affecting the possible lift and total length of the suction hose are that single stage vacuum pumps only reach an 85-90% partial vacuum, and that small air leakages, pipe friction losses, and the viscosity of the liquid further reduce the possible lift. =Emptying the tanker= Normally a tanker is emptied by gravity. It is possible to pressurize the vacuum tank to \\"pressure out\\" the liquid quicker (or against a small difference in elevation). This procedure is detrimental for the equipment, hence is used in special situations. The regular discharge time for a tanker of is about 15 minutes (or 7‚Äì10 minutes to unload a tanker of ). The outlet is typically in diameter. The discharge time depends on the thickness of the sludge, the size of the outlet valve and hose, the amount of garbage in the fecal sludge, and the frequency of driver cleaning the dump screen. Uses Vacuum trucks are used by town and municipal governments, as well as commercial entities around the world.Strande, L., Ronteltap, M., Brdjanovic, D. (eds.) (2014). Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) book - Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation. IWA Publishing, UK () = Human excreta = Several types of non- centralized sanitation systems are served by vacuum trucks. They are used to empty septage from cesspits, septic tanks, pit latrines, and communal latrines, for street cleanup, for sewer clean out, and for individual septic systems.Lloyd Kahn, John Hulls, Peter Aschwanden, The Septic System Owner's Manual Shelter Publications, Inc., 2007 p. 49 The trucks are used in the cleaning of sanitary sewer pumping stations. Vacuum trucks are used to empty portable toilets. In commercial aviation, vacuum trucks are used to collect waste from airplane toilets. Vacuum trucks discharge these wastes to the sewer network, to a wastewater treatment plant, or‚Äîusually illegally, for example in many developing countries‚Äî directly into the environment. The latter practice, called \\"institutionalised open defecation\\", is dangerous since it constitutes a public health and environmental hazard. = Industrial liquids = Vacuum trucks are used in the petroleum industry, for cleaning of storage tanks and spills. They are also an important part of drilling oil and natural gas wells, as they are located at the drilling site. Vacuum trucks are used to remove drilling mud, drilling cuttings, cement, spills, and for removal of brine water from production tanks. They dispose of this in sump pits, treatment plants or if within safe levels may be spread in farm fields. = Others = Vacuum trucks are also used for exposing underground utilities. The ground is jetted with water, and the vacuum truck sucks up the muddy product. This exposes the buried utility without the possibility of damage, as would be possible if a digging machine were used (i.e. tractor backhoe, tracked or wheeled excavator, ditch witches). Vacuum trucks can also be used for cleanup of contaminated soil.  Examples  =Bangalore, India= A typical vacuum truck in India has a capacity of and serves about five buildings a day. Assuming a 2-year emptying cycle one truck can cater to about 3,000 to 4,000 buildings or 15,000 to 20,000 people. Vacuum trucks are an alternative to the dangerous and humiliating practice of manual scavenging that became illegal in India with the Manual Scavenging Act of 1993. In the city of Bangalore alone, it is estimated that there were up to 200 such trucks in 2012, serving more than 3 million people.Vishwanat Srikantaiah, Biome Environmental Trust: Sanitation without pipes ‚Äì The 'Honeysucker' Approach to Human Waste Management Using Vacuum Trucks, in: Water and Food Security, World Water Week in Stockholm, 2012, Abstract Volume, pp. 239‚Äì240 These vacuum trucks are operated by private companies without the need for subsidies. The charge for emptying a septic tank is between 1,200 and 3,000 Rupees (USD 24 and 60) every two years.

History  This once luxury hotel was built in 1910 at Arlington Beach, Saskatchewan. It was built by the William Pearson Land CompanyWilliam Pearson Land Company as a center of operations in Saskatchewan along the Last Mountain Lake and was a popular vacation destination for people all across central Saskatchewan. As the CPR railway changed transportation patterns across the region, the land was sold to the Canadian Sunday School Mission in 1942. In 1960, Arlington Beach was purchased for a total of $14,000.00 by the Canada West Conference of the Free Methodist Church in Canada.  Design  Like most buildings built in the early part of the 20th century in Saskatchewan, the hotel was stick built and features a large two story veranda. The main floor of the hotel has four rooms. There is a large lounge that still contains much of the original furnishings and other period pieces. It also features large dining room, a bedroom, and a double kitchen. The second floor contains six medium sized rooms, and a two room suite. The third floor had two large rooms and a long hallway.  1910 Prices  The prices for the Arlington Beach House (and surrounding out buildings) in 1910 were as follows. * First Floor - $3.00 per day, $17.50 per week * Second Floor - $2.25 per day, $12.50 per week * Furnished Cottages - Containing two bedrooms, living room, and small kitchen. $3.00 per day or $17.50 per week, per person, including board to be furnished at the hotel. * Furnished Cottages - Without meals at the hotel. $15.00 per week. * Furnished Tents - Cot in tent and board at hotel $2.50 per day or $14.00 by the week per head. * Furnished Tents - Containing two cots, washing utensils, small amount of furniture, $1.25 per day or $7.00 per week. * Unfurnished Tents - $0.85 per day, $5.00 per week.

Members of the family Tephromelataceae are crustose lichens with green photobionts and lecideine or lecanorine apothecia. The species in Calvitimela have lecideine apothecia, are saxicolous and are primarily found in alpine to arctic regions. Species Calvitimela aglaea Calvitimela currently includes ten species: *Calvitimela aglaea (Sommerf.) Hafellner *Calvitimela armeniaca (DC.)

Thor Taxonomy The taxonomic history of Calvitimela is long and relatively complex. In the early days, the species now belonging to Calvitimela were placed in the classical genus Lecidea Ach., e.g. by Fries (1874; as Lecidea strips L. armeniacae). and Magnusson (1931; as ‚ÄúLecidea armeniaca- und elata-Gruppe‚Äù) In the 1980s, several taxonomists revised large groups of lichens in Lecanora and Lecidea. First, the generic name Tephromela was resurrected, and the new monotypic family Tephromelataceae described. Then, a group from Lecidea was moved into the genus Tephromela M. Choisy. This led to species with both lecanorine and lecideine apothecia being present in the same genus. Finally, the genus Calvitimela was erected for species with lecideine apothecia previously placed in Tephromela. Tephromelataceae consists of the Tephromela, Calvitimela, Mycoblastus Norman and Violella T. Sprib, and together these four genera constitute a well- supported monophyletic group. Morphology, anatomy, and chemistry The species of Calvitimela are crustose lichens. Their thallus are areolate and their apothecia lecideine. The apothecia are convex, black and shiny. Apothecia are rare or entirely absent in some sorediate species e.g. C. cuprea, C. livida and C. talayana. Ascii are generally of the Lecanora-type, but Bacidia-type ascii are also observed in C. aglaea and C. perlata. The spores are usually simple and ellipsoid. There is much chemical variation of secondary metabolites in the species of Calvitimela. Most prominently observed in the C. melaleuca ‚Äì complex, withalectorialic, norstictic, roccellic and psoromic acids occurring in different combinations in the species¬¥ several chemotypes. Ecology and distribution All species of Calvitimela grow on rocks. The species in Calvitimela reside either on boulders of varying size or directly on mountainous walls and are occasionally found on pebbles. A peculiar ecological preference is observed in C. cuprea. This species is more or less morphologically identical to C. livida, but seem to only grow on copper rich rocks, and is associated with old copper mine localities. Species in Calvitimela are predominantly distributed in alpine to arctic regions, and they seem to have a circumpolar distribution. On the other hand, due to lack of sampling in certain regions of the world (e.g. Africa, Asia and South America), the true distribution of Calvitimela is only partly known. C. austrochilensis is described from Chile and C. uniseptata from Antarctica, respectively. These species have not yet been included in any molecular phylogenetic studies. Therefore, whether they belong in Calvitimela or not, is yet to be confirmed by molecular data. Phylogeny Molecular phylogenetics has revolutionized the taxonomy of crustose lichens and revealed an extensive amount of cryptic species diversity. In Calvitimela there are some species that are morphologically identical, but are genetically distinct and have different chemotypes. In the C. melaleuca‚Äìcomplex at least two distinct chemical lineages are observed with no currently known morphological correlation. There have been few studies investigating Calvitimela from a molecular phylogenetics perspective. Only one phylogeny focusing exclusively on Calvitimela has been published. They found Calvitimela, Tephromela and Violella to constitute a well-supported monophyletic group. The relationship between the main clades remained partly unresolved, however. No study has yet included all species currently circumscribed to Calvitimela, but the genus is so far indicated to be paraphyletic.

After the devastating An Lushan Rebellion, this area became virtually independent of the central government, as these regions were controlled by ex-rebel generals who had substantial territory and forces. The independence of these fanzhen threatened the central government of the Tang dynasty. During and after the An Lushan Rebellion, the Tang court lost control of vast swathes of territory and a number of defense commands evolved into autonomous kingdoms, their military commissioners became warlords, only nominally subservient to the Tang court. Particularly recalcitrant were Ch√©ngd√© (), L√∫l√≥ng () and W√®ib√≥ () in the Hebei area. The central court was all but helpless in the northeast. In the south, however, it took a much more aggressive stand against such defense commands as Zƒ´qƒ´ng () (mainly in Shandong), Bi√†ns√≤ng () (in east Henan), and Hu√°ixƒ´ () (in south Henan), which posed a more immediate and palpable threat to the transportation of strategic grains through the Grand Canal, on which the court depended. During Emperor Xianzong's reign this region was briefly subdued by the central government, but after his death it became independent again. By the reign of Emperor Wenzong, the central government had lost all control over this region. The situation was summed up thus by Tang dynasty's chancellor Niu Sengru: > \\"Ever since the Anshi Rebellion, the three Fanzhen have not been part of the > country. Although Liu Chong briefly gave the area to the central government, > in the end it became independent and 80 million strings of cash were wasted. > These regions are fought over frequently; one day Zhicheng has it, the next > day Daiyi.

The company played a major part in transforming commercial milk from a dirty, disease-spreading product into a clean and healthy one. History L. B. Halsey, a lawyer who married Sarah Frances Sheffield, (daughter of the late John H and Anne Maria Sheffield) became interested in the dairy business when called upon to help deliver his widowed mother-in-law‚Äôs butter. Through careful selection and breeding the Sheffield herd of Mahwah, New Jersey, produced superior milk, which in turn made fine butter. He began marketing the butter in his spare time in the city and by 1880 had given up the law to devote himself to the dairy trade. His first innovation was to design a covered milk wagon that protected fluid milk from dust. Halsey trained other farmers to improve the quality of their milk and bought milk only from the best herds. Computer Music Center, formerly a Sheffield Farms dairy plant, on 125th Street in New York City In 1892, he installed the first pasteurizing machine in the United States, imported from Germany, at Sheffield Farms‚Äô Bloomville, New York, plant. The following year, pasteurization was demonstrated at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Commercial milk pasteurization was introduced in Baltimore in 1893 but Cincinnati is credited with the first large scale pasteurization program in America. New York City followed in 1898, although pasteurization was not yet required for some years. Slawson Brothers entered the milk distribution business in 1866. Loton H. Horton (April 22, 1852 ‚Äì December 15, 1926), a Slawson on his mother‚Äôs side, began driving a milk wagon for his uncle when he was 16. He quickly rose to lead the company, becoming a partner at the age of 21 and principal owner in 1898. When the company merged with T. W. Decker and Sheffield Farms, he became the new firm‚Äôs president, a post he held until his death in 1926. At that time, Sheffield Farms Co. (the name was eventually shortened from Sheffield Farms‚ÄìSlawson‚ÄìDecker) was the largest dairy products company in the world with nearly 2,000 retail routes and over 300 stores, mostly in New York City. Just before his death, Horton had sold the company to the National Dairy Products Corporation. National Dairy Products was formed in 1923 as a merger of several dairy concerns and continued to grow through acquisitions, the most important of which was the addition of Sheffield Farms. Others included Breyer Ice Cream, also purchased in 1926, and Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corporation in 1930. All of the companies continued to operate independently, marketing products under their recognized brand names. In 1969, National Dairy Products became Kraftco and then Kraft in 1976. Horace S. Tuthill Jr., retired in 1950 as a vice president of the Sheffield Farms Company in charge of sales and advertising, after thirty years with the company. Joseph A. Mulvihill and Michael J. Mulvihill worked for the company from 1920 to 1950 in the New York City and Jamaica plants. There was also a store in Rockaway during the summer months. Since 1964 the Sheffield buildings on West 57th Street between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues in Manhattan have been the CBS Broadcast Center. The company built the Sheffield Farms Stable between 1903 and 1909. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

Career Formed in 1979 by teenage friends Paul Bevoir and Melvyn J Taub, the band developed their style under the guidance of former Advertising and Secret Affair drummer, Paul Bultitude. After recording a few demos with Bultitude, Bevoir and Taub pulled together a makeshift band for promotional photos, enlisting keyboardist Angus Nanan and bassist Paul Bonin.[ Allmusic Guide] article by Chris Woodstra Gaining valuable live experience as a touring support act to Secret Affair in 1981 and 1982, through their connection with Bultitude, Bevoir and Taub temporarily joined Mari Wilson's Wilsations as backing vocalists in 1981. Bevoir soon left to focus on his own music, while Taub went on to enjoy chart success with the Wilsations, before returning to work with Bevoir in The Jetset. In 1983 Bultitude signed the band to his Dance Network label in 1983 and released their debut, The Best of the Jetset EP. From the beginning The Jetset presented themselves as being as famous as their heroes The Monkees. The band's marketing sowed the seeds of the Jetset myth before they were even well known. Their eye-catching EP sleeve included the band clowning around in stills \\"from their forthcoming TV series\\", hanging out of the Monkee-influenced 'Jetsetmobile' (a Ford Capri with customised 'JETSET' number plates). On the musical side, Bevoir had penned a quartet of tunes for the EP, including \\"The Jetset Theme\\", billed as an 'original soundtrack recording'. With an inspired promotional push, the EP was sent to the press accompanied by merchandise including Jetset posters, badges, stickers, key rings and bubblegum cards. Mod fanzines followed suit, helping to stoke the fires of Jetsetmania. Soon a Jetset cartoon strip appeared in Shadows & Reflections, the underground magazine of long-time Jetset champion Chris Hunt. The group even released their own Christmas flexi- disc through Shadows & Reflections in December 1983.Elkins, Alfie, Jetset Biog., 2004, Paul Bevoir Official Site. There Goes the Neighborhood, their first full-length album was released in 1985. The album was well reviewed in the UK music press and it was followed by Go Bananas, an album which featured commercials for Jetset products between songs. Bevoir retired from touring to concentrate on his songwriting and together with Bultitude created the lushly orchestrated Vaudeville Park. The band released their final album, Five, shortly before their acrimonious demise in 1988. Legacy The Jetset's music has been reissued numerous times.

The Chrysler 70 (also called the ) was a 6-cylinder automobile, designed to provide customers with an advanced, well- engineered car at a more affordable price than they might expect. (Elements of this car are traceable back to a prototype which had been under development at Willys at the time Chrysler was there). Engineering innovations The original 1924 Chrysler included a carburetor air filter, high-compression engine, full pressure lubrication inside the engine, and an oil filter, at a time when most autos came without all these features. Among the innovations in its early years would be the first practical mass-produced four-wheel hydraulic brakes, a system nearly completely engineered by Chrysler with patents assigned to Lockheed. Chrysler pioneered rubber engine mounts to reduce vibration; Oilite bearings; and superfinishing for shafts. Chrysler also developed a road wheel with a ridged rim, designed to keep a deflated tire from flying off the wheel. This safety wheel was eventually adopted by the auto industry worldwide. Following the introduction of the Chrysler, the Maxwell marque was dropped after the 1925 model year. The new, lower-priced 4-cylinder Chrysler introduced for 1926 year was a badge-engineered Maxwell. The advanced engineering and testing that went into Chrysler Corporation cars helped to push the company to the second-place position in U.S. sales by 1936, a position it would last hold in 1949. Early models * Chrysler 70 * Chrysler Touring =Vehicle marques= 1931 Plymouth In 1928, Chrysler Corporation began dividing its vehicle offerings by price class and function. The Plymouth brand was introduced at the low priced end of the market (created essentially by once again reworking and rebadging Chrysler's 4-cylinder model). At the same time, the DeSoto marque was introduced in the medium-price field. Shortly thereafter, Chrysler bought the Dodge Brothers automobile and truck company and launched the Fargo range of trucks. By the late 1930s, the DeSoto and Dodge divisions would trade places in the corporate hierarchy. This proliferation of marques under Chrysler's umbrella might have been inspired by the similar strategy employed successfully by General Motors. Beginning in 1955, Imperial, formerly the top model of the Chrysler brand, became a separate make of its own, and in 1960, the Valiant was introduced likewise as a distinct marque. In the U.S. market, Valiant was made a model in the Plymouth line and the DeSoto make was discontinued for 1961. With those exceptions per applicable year and market, Chrysler's range from lowest to highest price from the 1940s through the 1970s was Valiant, Plymouth, Dodge, DeSoto, Chrysler, and Imperial. After acquiring AMC in 1987, Chrysler fulfilled one of AMC's conditions of sale by creating the Eagle marque in 1988 to be sold at existing AMC-Jeep dealers. The Eagle brand lasted a decade, being discontinued in 1998, while Plymouth was ended three years later. By 2001 and as of September 2009, the company had three marques worldwide: Dodge, Jeep, and Chrysler. Effective October 2009, however, a fourth brand was established with the creation of the Ram brand, a breakout from the Dodge marque. Initially, the new brand consisted of the Ram full-size pickup, Dakota compact pickup and the Sprinter van. During the unveiling of Chrysler's business plan on November 5, CEO Sergio Marchionne indicated that the Ram brand will be augmented by Fiat-sourced vehicles, including a smaller van than the Sprinter, which itself would be replaced by a Fiat-based vehicle. In 2011, however, Fiat became Chrysler's fifth brand with the North American introduction of the Fiat 500. =Other marques= MoPar, Chryco, AutoPar In the 1930s, the company created a formal vehicle parts division under the MoPar brand (a portmanteau of Motor Parts), with the result that \\"Mopar\\" remains a colloquial term for vehicles produced by Chrysler Corporation. The MoPar (later Mopar) brand was not used in Canada, where parts were sold under the Chryco and AutoPar brands, until the Mopar brand was phased into the Canadian market beginning in the late 1970s. Many Chrysler Corporation vehicle parts also bore variants of the DPCD monogram, for Dodge- Plymouth-Chrysler-DeSoto, well after the 1961 end of DeSoto production. Airtemp logo on window of air conditioned Chrysler Corp. vehicle headlight bulb box from 1948; note circular DPCD logo Airtemp Chrysler's Airtemp marque for stationary and mobile air conditioning, refrigeration, and climate control was launched with the first installation in 1930's Chrysler Building. The Airtemp Corporation was incorporated in 1934 and it utilized a former Maxwell factory. PPG Airtemp invented capacity regulators, sealed radial compressors, and the self-contained air conditioning system, along with a superior high-speed radial compressor, and by 1941 had over 500 dealers selling its air conditioning and heating systems. The company supplied medical refrigeration units in World War II, and dominated the industry in the 1940s but slowly fell behind. By the 1970s Airtemp was losing money and was sold to Fedders in 1976. In 2012 the name was reborn as a Nordyne byproduct exclusively sold by the R.E. Michel Company. Acustar In the 1980s, Chrysler formed a subsidiary business called Acustar to sell parts to other automakers as well as supplying parts for Chrysler-built vehicles, similar to General Motors' creation of Delphi Corporation and Ford's later creation of Visteon. Safeguard Safeguard is Chrysler's brand for original and replacement auto glass, much of which, from 1958 through the mid-2000s, was made at Chrysler's McGraw glass plant, and some of which was manufactured for Chrysler by established glass companies. =Airflow= 1936 Chrysler Airflow Series C-9 In 1934 the company introduced the Airflow models, featuring an advanced streamlined body, among the first to be designed using aerodynamic principles. Chrysler created the industry's first wind tunnel to develop them. Buyers rejected its styling, and the more conventionally designed Dodge and Plymouth cars pulled the firm through the Depression years. Plymouth was one of only a few marques that actually increased sales during the cash-strapped thirties. The unsuccessful Airflow had a chilling effect on Chrysler styling and marketing, which remained determinedly conservative through the 1940s and into the 1950s, with the single exception of the installation of hidden headlights on the very brief production run of 1942 DeSotos. Engineering advances continued, and in 1951 the firm introduced the first of a long and famous series of Hemi V8s. =The Forward Look= 1955 Imperial car model shown on display at January 1955 Chicago Auto Show 1955 Chrysler - Philco all transistor car radio - \\"Breaking News\\" radio broadcast announcement. In 1955 things brightened with the introduction of Virgil Exner's successful Forward Look designs, followed in 1956 by Chrysler's pioneering adoption of transistor radios in cars. On April 28, 1955, Chrysler and Philco had announced the development and production of the world's first all-transistor car radio.Wall Street Journal, \\"Chrysler Promises Car Radio With Transistors Instead of Tubes in '56\\", April 28th 1955, page 1 The Mopar model 914HR was developed and produced by Chrysler and Philco and was an $150.00 \\"option\\" on the 1956 Imperial automobile models. Philco was the company that had manufactured the all-transistor car radio Mopar model 914HR, starting in the fall of 1955 at its Sandusky, Ohio plant, for the Chrysler corporation.Walter P. Chrysler Museum, With the inauguration of the second generation Forward Look cars for 1957, Torsion-Aire suspension was introduced. This was not air suspension, but an indirect-acting, torsion-spring front suspension system which drastically reduced unsprung weight and shifted the car's center of gravity downward and rearward. This resulted in both a smoother ride and significantly improved handling. A rush to production of the 1957 models led to quality control problems including poor body fit and finish, resulting in significant and early rusting. This, coupled with a national recession, found the company again in recovery mode. On September 28, 1957, Chrysler had announced the production of electronic fuel injection (EFI) to be available as an option on some of its new 1958 car models (Chrysler 300D, Dodge D500, DeSoto Adventurer, Plymouth Golden Commando V-8) that resulted with approximately 35 total installations. Chrysler used the same all-transistor modulator \\"Electrojector\\" fuel injection system from Bendix Corporation that was withdrawn from public sale of the 1957 Rambler Rebel by American Motors because the system could not be made reliable. Owners of EFI Chryslers were so dissatisfied that all but one were retrofitted with carburetors, while that one has been completely restored, with original EFI electronic problems resolved. =Government programs in World War II= Vehicles and systems During World War II, essentially all of Chrysler's facilities were devoted to building military vehicles and systems. Chrysler ranked eighth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. Chrysler made the converters for the Manhattan Project's K-25 gaseous diffusion plant in their Lynch Road plant in Detroit, after Dr Carl Heussner of the Chrysler plating laboratory solved the nickel plating problem. Radar antennas One of Chrysler's most significant contributions to the war effort was not in the field of vehicles but in design and manufacture of the components of radar systems. The Radiation Laboratory at MIT, established in 1941 to develop microwave radars, developed the SCR-584, the most widely recognized radar system of the war era. This system included a parabolic antenna six feet in diameter that was mechanically aimed in a helical pattern (round and round as well as up and down). For the final production design of this antenna and its highly complex drive mechanism, the Army's Signal Corps Laboratories turned to Chrysler's Central Engineering Office. There, the parabola was changed from aluminum to steel, allowing production forming using standard automotive presses. To keep weight down, 6,000 equally spaced holed were drilled in the face (this did not affect the radiation pattern). The drive mechanism was completely redesigned, using technology derived from Chrysler's research in automotive gears and differentials. The changes resulted in improved performance, reduced weight, and easier maintenance. A large portion of the Dodge plant was used to build 1,500 of the SCR-584 antennas as well as the vans needed for the system.Stout, Wesley W.; The Great Detective, Chrysler Corporation, 1946Colton, Roger B.; \\"Radar in the United States Army,\\" Proc. IRE, vol. 33, p. 749, 1947 =Postwar government programs= After the war, Chrysler continued with special projects for the U.S. government. These were in the aerospace fields of missiles and space boosters. Missiles In April 1950, the U.S. Army established the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC) at Redstone Arsenal, adjacent to Huntsville, Alabama. To form OGMC, about 1,000 civilian and military personnel were transferred from Fort Bliss, Texas. Included was a group of German scientists and engineers led by Wernher von Braun; this group had been brought to America under Project Paperclip. OGMC designed the Army's first short-range ballistic missile, the PGM-11 Redstone, based on the WWII German V-2 missile. Chrysler established the Missile Division to serve as the Redstone prime contractor, setting up an engineering operation in Huntsville and for production obtaining use from the U.S. Navy of a large plant in Warren, Michigan. The Redstone was in active service from 1958 to 1964; it was also the first missile to test-launch a live nuclear weapon, first detonated in a 1958 test in the South Pacific.Bullard, John W.; \\"History Of The Redstone Missile System,\\" Historical Monograph Project Number: AMC 23 M. Historical Division, Army Missile Command Working together, the Missile Division and von Braun's team greatly increased the capability of the Redstone, resulting in the PGM-19 Jupiter, a medium-range ballistic missile. In May 1959, a Jupiter missiles launched two small monkeys into space in a nose cone on a Jupiter; this was America's first successful flight and recovery of live space payloads. Responsibility for deploying Jupiter missiles was transferred from the Army to the Air Force; armed with nuclear warheads, they were first deployed in Italy and Turkey during the early 1960s.Fact Sheet: Chrysler SM-78/PGM-19 Jupiter, National Museum of the U.S. Air Force; In October 1950, K. T. Keller the president and chairman of the board of Chrysler was appointed part-time Director of Guided Missiles by President Truman to \\"make sense\\" of the missile program. Kenneth Nichols who had worked with him on the Manhattan Project was his assistant. They were to select missiles to be put into production and specify the number required and give more priority to air defense missiles. The process of authorizing came to be known as \\"Kellerizing\\", and once when the Navy objected to numbers lower than they desired being specified for their missile, Keller refused to accept the Navy letter. He sent it back, saying he was willing to discuss the numbers but refused to reply in writing and get into the \\"Pentagon paper mill procedure\\" of \\"endless reviews and letter writing\\". He resigned in September 1953. Space boosters In July 1959, NASA chose the Redstone missile as the basis for the Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle to be used for suborbital test flights of the Project Mercury spacecraft. Three unmanned MLRV launch attempts were made between November 1960 and March 1961, two of which were successful. The MLRV successfully launched the chimpanzee Ham and astronauts Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom on three suborbital flights in January, May and July 1961. As America's manned space flight plans became more ambitious, Wernher von Braun's team designed the Saturn family of launch vehicles. With Chrysler's Huntsville operation then designated the Space Division, Chrysler became Marshall Space Flight Center‚Äôs prime contractor for the first (booster) stage of the Saturn I and Saturn IB vehicles. The Saturn I booster stage was designated S-I, which was upgraded to the S-IB for the Saturn IB. Chrysler based its fuel tank design on a cluster of its Redstone and Jupiter tanks, using four Redstone tanks to hold the RP-1 fuel and four to hold the liquid oxygen (LOX) oxidizer, around a central Jupiter LOX tank. Chrysler built these for the Apollo program in the Michoud Assembly Facility in East New Orleans, one of the largest manufacturing plants in the world. Between October 1961 and July 1965, NASA launched four S-I boosters with dummy upper stages on suborbital test flights, followed by six complete Saturn Is on unmanned orbital flights. The last five of these tested boilerplate Apollo spacecraft, and the last three also carried Pegasus micro meteoroid detection satellites. All flights were successful. Between February 1966 and July 1975, NASA launched nine Saturn IBs on two suborbital flights and seven orbital flights (five of which were manned); all flights were successful.Bilstein, Roger E.; Stages to Saturn: A Technological History of the Apollo/Saturn Launch Vehicles; NASA SP-4206, 1980, ; https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/sp4206.htm =1960s= Starting in the 1960 model year, Chrysler built all their passenger cars with Unibody (unit-body or monocoque) construction, except the Imperials which retained body-on-frame construction until 1967. Chrysler thus became the only one of the Big Three American automakers (General Motors Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler) to offer unibody construction on the vast majority of their product lines. This construction technique, now the worldwide standard, offers advantages in vehicle rigidity, handling, and crash safety, while reducing squeak and rattle development as the vehicle ages. Chrysler's contributions to the technology included the first use of computers to design unit-body cars, and the first setup where exterior sheet metal was not required for structural strength, making sheet metal replacement easier. Chrysler's new compact line, the Valiant, opened strong and continued to gain market share for over a decade. Valiant was introduced as a marque of its own, but the Valiant line was placed under the Plymouth marque for US-market sales in 1961. The 1960 Valiant was the first production automobile with an alternator (generating alternating current, paired with diodes for rectification back to direct current) rather than a direct current electrical generator as standard equipment. It proved such an improvement that it was used in all Chrysler products in 1961. The DeSoto marque was withdrawn from the market after the introduction of the 1961 models due in part to the broad array of the Dodge lines and the general neglect of the division. The same affliction plagued Plymouth as it also suffered when Dodge crept into Plymouth's price range. This would eventually lead to the demise of Plymouth several decades later. An ill-advised downsizing of the full-size Dodge and Plymouth lines in 1962 hurt sales and profitability for several years. 1966 Plymouth Barracuda Partly to compensate for rust problems on the 1957 models and partly to ensure that their Unibody cars would remain safe, as rust was a larger problem when body panels were required for strength, Chrysler pioneered the use of electrostatic charges to improve anti-rust agent adhesion in their 1960 models. The company was also the first to use a seven-step rust proofing bath system, though not the first to use rust proofing baths. In April 1964, the Plymouth Barracuda, a Valiant sub-model, was introduced. The huge glass rear window and sloping roof were polarizing styling features. Barracuda was released almost two weeks before Ford's Mustang, making the Barracuda the first pony car. Even so, the Mustang outsold it 10-to-1 between April 1964 and August 1965. Perception of the Barracuda as nothing but a reskinned Valiant was not aided by sharing front-end sheet metal.Flory, p. 319. Chrysler's target buyers were obviously men, and attracting female buyers was apparently not a high priority, because a 1967 sales brochure proclaimed, \\"At last‚Äîspecifications your wife can understand.\\"Flory, p. 531. (This was, perhaps, an improvement over the Dodge La Femme option of 1955.Flory, p. 644. It recognized that women were at least reading the specifications.) =Expansion into Europe= In the 1960s Chrysler expanded into Europe, attaining a majority interest in the British Rootes Group in 1964, Simca of France and Barreiros of Spain, to form Chrysler Europe. For the Rootes Group, one outcome of this takeover was the launch of the Hillman Avenger in 1970 (briefly sold in the U.S. as the Plymouth Cricket), which sold in Britain alongside the rear-engined Imp and the Hunter. During the 1970s the former Rootes Group got into severe financial difficulties. The Simca and Barreiros divisions were more successful, but in the end the various problems were overwhelming and the firm gained little from these ventures. Chrysler sold these assets to PSA Peugeot Citro√´n in 1978, which in turn sold the British and Spanish truck production lines to Renault of France. More successfully, at this same time the company helped create the muscle car market in the U.S., first by producing a street version of its Hemi racing engine and then by introducing a legendary string of affordable but high-performance vehicles such as the Plymouth GTX, Plymouth Road Runner, and Dodge Charger. The racing success of several of these models on the NASCAR circuit burnished the company's engineering reputation. =The 1970s= The 1970s were tumultuous for Chrysler since, like all the American car companies of the era, the company was reliant on a marketplace where cheap oil and smog- filled cities were the norms. As conditions changed, Chrysler could not adapt in time. Critics of government regulation have claimed that U.S. anti-trust laws prohibited U.S. automakers from forming Japanese- or European-style industry consortiums (which helped these foreign competitors to save costs). Chrysler was also slow to adapt to a gradual tightening of anti-pollution regulations. However, given that Chrysler's European divisions already had both the talent and the knowledge to make fuel-economic, less polluting vehicles, all that Chrysler's management had to do was to import European technology that it already owned. Chrysler's American difficulties, therefore, were largely the result of poor management. Chrysler's lower sales volumes meant that new development and implementation costs made up a larger proportion of a vehicle's cost compared to Ford and General Motors. To avoid pricing themselves out of the market, Chrysler clumsily detuned its existing engines to meet emission requirements, which resulted in lower fuel economy at a time when fuel prices were rising. There was a rush to sell the compact Dodge Dart and Plymouth Valiant, but the 1973 oil crisis sharply reduced demand for the large, fuel-thirsty vehicles Americans had previously bought in large number and which made up the bulk of Chrysler's product line. At mid- decade, the company scored a conspicuous success with its first entry in the personal luxury car market, the Chrysler Cordoba. The hurried introduction of the Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volar√© in 1976 brought enormous warranty costs to repair faulty design and shoddy construction, and destroyed the longstanding loyalty built up by the Dart and Valiant predecessors. Chrysler Europe essentially collapsed in 1977, and was offloaded to Peugeot the following year, soon after having helped design the new Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni. In 1980, Chrysler Australia, which was producing the locally developed Chrysler Valiant and the Mitsubishi Galant based Chrysler Sigma, was sold to Mitsubishi Motors and changed its name to Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited. The sub compact Horizon was reaching the US market as the second gas crisis struck, devastating sales of Chrysler's larger cars and trucks, and the company had no strong compact line to fall back on. =Turbine= For many years, Chrysler developed gas turbine engines, which are capable of operating on a wide array of combustible fuels, for automotive use. Turbines were common in military vehicles, and Chrysler built many prototypes for passenger cars. In the 1960s, mass production seemed almost ready. Fifty Chrysler Turbine Cars, specialty designed Ghia-bodied coupes were built in 1962 and placed into the hands of consumers for final testing. After further development and testing to make emissions conform to 1970s-enacted EPA standards, the engines were planned as an option for the 1977 model LeBaron. However, Chrysler was forced to abandon the turbine engine as a precondition of U.S. government loan guarantees when the company experienced financial difficulties in the late 1970s. =Lee Iacocca's Impact= A Dodge Aries. The \\"K-cars\\" are generally credited with saving Chrysler from bankruptcy. In 1978, Lee Iacocca, recently fired from being Ford's executive, was aggressively courted and brought in as CEO . At the time, Chrysler was losing millions, largely due to recalls of the company's Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volare, cars that Iacocca would later claim should have been delayed until prototypes were fully tested. He began rebuilding the entire company from the ground up, laying off many workers, selling the loss-making Chrysler Europe division to Peugeot, and bringing in many former associates from his former company. Also from Ford, Iacocca brought to Chrysler the \\"Mini-Max\\" project, which would bear fruit in 1983 with the successful Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager. Henry Ford II had wanted nothing to do with the Mini-Max, a restyled version of the minivan that Toyota was selling in huge numbers in Asia and Latin America, which doomed the project at Ford. Hal Sperlich, the driving force behind the Mini-Max at Ford had been fired a few months before Iacocca and was waiting for him at Chrysler, where the two would make automotive history. Iacocca proved to be a capable public spokesman, appearing in advertisements to advise customers that \\"If you find a better car, buy it.\\" He would also provide a rallying point for Japan-bashing and instilling pride in American products. His book Talking Straight was a response to Akio Morita's Made in Japan. Iacocca arrived shortly after the introduction of the subcompact Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon. The front-wheel drive Omni and Horizon became instant hits, selling over 300,000 units each in their debut year, showing what was to come for Chrysler. Ironically, the Omni and Horizon had been designed alongside the Chrysler Horizon with much input from the Chrysler Europe division of the company, which Iacocca axed in 1978. 1980s Realizing that the company would go out of business if it did not receive a significant amount of money to turn the company around, Iacocca approached the United States Congress on September 7, 1979 and asked for US$1.5 billion in loan guarantees. Congress reluctantly passed the \\"Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979\\" on December 20, 1979 (signed into law by President Jimmy Carter on January 7, 1980), prodded by Chrysler workers and dealers in every congressional district who feared the loss of their livelihoods. The military then bought thousands of Dodge pickup trucks which entered military service as the Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle M-880 Series. With such help and a few innovative cars, Chrysler would manage to avoid bankruptcy and slowly recover. After receiving this reprieve, Chrysler released the first of the K-Car line, the Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant, in 1981. Like the minivan which would come later, these compact automobiles were based on design proposals that Ford had rejected during Iacocca's (and Sperlich's) tenure there. Since they were released in the middle of the major 1980‚Äì1982 recession, these small, efficient and inexpensive, front-wheel drive cars sold rapidly. Aside from small cars, Iacocca re-introduced the full sized Imperial as a company's flagship, new model had all of the newest technologies of the time ‚Äì including fully electronic fuel injection (the first car in the U.S. to be so equipped) and all digital dashboard. In February 1982 Chrysler announced the sale of Chrysler Defense, its profitable defense subsidiary to General Dynamics for US$348.5 million. The sale was completed in March 1982 for the revised figure of US$336.1 million. Chrysler also introduced the minivan, which was by and large Sperlich's \\"baby\\", in the fall of 1983, which led the automobile industry in sales for 25 years Because of the K-cars and minivans, along with the reforms Iacocca implemented, the company turned around quickly and by 1983, was able to repay the government-backed loans \\"[Chrysler] could announce today that it will pay off the remaining $800 million by September .\\" several years ahead of time, resulting in a profit of $350 million to the U.S. government. In 1987, it was discovered that Chrysler sold an estimated 32,750 cars that had been test-driven with disconnected odometers ‚Äì some as much as ‚Äì before being shipped to dealers. The controversy gained fire after the United States Senate got involved, as Senator Sam Nunn bought one of the Chryslers in question. Chrysler settled out of court with complainants.Chrysler Fined for Safety ViolationsNew York Times, July 12, 1987Chrysler to Pay Some 40,000 Owners in SettlementNew York Times, Aug 24, 1988 Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca sought to minimize damage to the corporation's public image by calling a news conference in which he termed the action \\"dumb\\" and \\"unforgivable\\". A joint venture with Mitsubishi called Diamond Star Motors strengthened the company's hand in the small car market. Chrysler also acquired American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987, for its Jeep brand and much needed production capacity, AMC's Eagle Premier would be the basis for the future Chrysler LH platform sedans. This bolstered the firm's size, but the American Motors purchase was saddled with $900 million in debt. Also, Chrysler was still the weakest of the Big Three. In 1987, Chrysler surprised the industry by purchasing Italian sports car maker Lamborghini, with the acquisition heavily driven by Iacocca. Lamborghini would subsequently be sold off in 1994. Iacocca received much credit for Chrysler's turnaround from near bankruptcy, with his commercials giving him celebrity status, and some mentioned him as a potential U.S. presidential candidate in 1988. However the latter part of his tenure from 1988 onwards was less successful. The acquisitions of Gulfstream Aerospace, Electrospace Systems, and other companies was intended to protect Chrysler from the cyclical nature of the auto industry but they shrunk the company's working capital from $14.3 billion to just $1.7 billion. In addition Iacocca enjoyed being in the spotlight and gradually isolated himself from his \\"Gang of Ford\\" managers that he had brought over from Ford Motor Company. By 1992, the board pushed Iacocca to retire, albeit with a generous severance package. Iacocca was also responsible for Chrysler's acquisition of AMC in 1987, which brought the profitable Jeep division under Chrysler's corporate umbrella. It also created the Eagle division, formed from AMC's dealer network. By this time, AMC had already finished most of the work with the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which Iacocca desperately wanted. The Grand Cherokee would not be released until 1992 for the 1993 model year. That same year, Iacocca stepped down as CEO and Chairman of Chrysler at the end of 1992, being succeeded in these posts by Robert Eaton. Although Robert Lutz, currently the President of Chrysler, was the second-ranking executive in the company, he earlier opposed the merger with Fiat that Iacocca had championed. Due to their feud, Iacocca convinced the board to pass over Lutz for the chairmanship of Chrysler. However, Eaton and Lutz did develop a strong working relationship. =1990s= LH platform-based Dodge Intrepid In the early 1990s, Chrysler made its first steps back into Europe, setting up car production in Austria, and beginning right hand drive manufacture of certain Jeep models in a 1993 return to the UK market. The continuing popularity of Jeep, bold new models for the domestic market such as the Dodge Ram pickup, Dodge Viper (badged as \\"Chrysler Viper\\" in Europe) sports car, and Plymouth Prowler hot rod, and new \\"cab forward\\" front-wheel drive LH sedans put the company in a strong position as the decade waned. In 1988, Chrysler and Fiat, owner of Alfa Romeo, reached an agreement that named Chrysler to be the exclusive distributor for Alfa Romeo in North America and easily allow Chrysler dealers to sell Alfa products, which lasted until Alfa left the United States in 1995. The initial contact between the two firms would lead to high-level talks in 1990 between Iacocca and Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli about establishing joint ventures in the United States and Europe, and the possibility of Fiat taking a large equity stake in Chrysler. However, talks dragged on and eventually broke off. Ironically, Fiat would acquire a majority stake in Chrysler following its 2009 restructuring. In 1991, Chrysler began the process of moving its corporate headquarters from its 1925 founding location of Highland Park, Michigan, to nearby Auburn Hills. The move was complete by 1993. In 1995, former CEO Lee Iacocca assisted in billionaire Kirk Kerkorian's hostile takeover of Chrysler, which was ultimately unsuccessful. The next year, Kerkorian and Chrysler made a five-year agreement that includes a gag order preventing Iacocca from speaking publicly about Chrysler.Special Reports: Timeline: The career of Lee Iacocca. ‚Äì Detroit News. ‚Äì March 17, 2002. Chrysler was among the companies boycotted by gay rights groups after removing advertisements from the ABC sitcom Ellen in 1997, which it deemed \\"controversial.\\" =DaimlerChrysler 1998‚Äì2007= Chrysler 300 In 1998 Daimler-Benz and Chrysler had formed a 50‚Äì50 partnership. Chrysler Corporation then was legally renamed DaimlerChrysler Motors Company LLC, while its total operations began doing business as Chrysler Group. This was initially declared to be a merger of equals, but it became evident that once Chrysler Chairman and CEO Bob Eaton retired, that Daimler would take majority control. Other executives like President Thomas T. Stallkamp, once considered the heir-apparent of Eaton, and Vice-Chairman Robert Lutz were soon forced out. Eaton, Stallkamp, and Lutz had been described as the \\"triumvirate\\" responsible for Chrysler's successes in the late 1990s, with much credit going to Lutz's platform design teams. Daimler-Benz got the remainder of Chrysler, excluding the Eagle brand, which was facing extinction at the time. Then-Daimler-Benz CEO Juergen Schrempp had \\"promised a marriage made in heaven and huge synergies\\". But Martin H. Wiggers' concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were too low.Wiggers Martin H.: Sternstunden, Strategische Unternehmensfuehrung Nr. 2, 2000. Munich, St. Gallen 2000, ISSN 1436-5812 However, it proved to be a disaster for Daimler, which poured billions of dollars into Chrysler, draining management and resources, and repeatedly dragging down its Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicle subsidiary. Chrysler President James P. Holden was responsible for misjudging the launch of the all-new 2001 minivan that resulted in an expensive surplus of 2000 models, losing considerable market share to rivals (Chrysler had created and long dominated the minivan market), and also underestimated demand for the surprisingly popular PT Cruiser, resulting in a $512 million third-quarter loss in 2000 that led to his firing later that year. Dieter Zetsche was appointed CEO of the Chrysler Group in 2000. The Plymouth brand was phased out in 2001, and plans for cost cutting by sharing of platforms and components began. The Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class-based Chrysler Crossfire coup√©/roadster and the Chrysler Pacifica three-row crossover were among the initial results of this plan; the Crossfire was unsuccessful while the Pacifica started strong but faded after a few years. A return to rear-wheel drive was announced for a new line of full size cars, spearheaded by the Chrysler 300 and Dodge Magnum which used some Mercedes-Benz W211 components and offered a new HEMI V8 engine as a performance option. While the Magnum received a tepid reception in the market, the 300 garnered much attention and sold well. The partnership with Mitsubishi was dissolved as DaimlerChrysler divested its stake in the firm. Financial performance improved and Chrysler was generating a significant part of Daimler-Chrysler's profits from 2004 to 2005, as the other subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz, incurred costs for restructuring. By 2005, Chrysler was said to be the healthiest of the Detroit Three automakers (compared to General Motors and Ford Motor Company). As a result of Zetsche's apparent success in a turnaround of Chrysler, Juergen Schrempp, the CEO of parent company Daimler- Chrysler, was pressured to retire early. Zetsche was elevated to CEO of Daimler-Chrysler on January 1, 2006, and Thomas W. LaSorda became President and CEO of Chrysler Group. However, in 2006, while DCX's other subsidiary Mercedes-Benz turned a profit, Chrysler swung to a loss and analysts believed that the profitable years of 2004‚Äì05 would be unlikely to be return in the future. That led to suggestions that the eight-year merger would come to an end, as Mercedes (which made up around 33% of Daimler's $200 billion in 2006 revenues) did not get any competitive boost from Chrysler, and that Daimler would be a stronger and more profitable group without the U.S. unit. Zetsche admitted that Chrysler offered no serious scale of advantages, though he initially insisted a spinoff was not being considered and said that management's first priority is to fix the problems at Chrysler by trimming production and redoubling efforts to boost its competitiveness. Some suggest that Zetsche's tenure was a mixed success, with Chrysler still relying heavily on gas-guzzling SUVs, and most of its product lineup was unsuccessful, despite using Mercedes-derived technologies. Despite radical restructuring and improved models, analysts said that it was difficult to expect a solid recovery at Chrysler, due to the negative dynamics of the U.S. auto market and Chrysler's legacy labor and health care costs. In 2006, Zetsche had starred in the \\"Dr. Z\\" ad campaign which cast him as an all-knowing, German-accented wizard of the auto industry, in TV spots and a website. The strategy was to communicate that Chrysler was backed up by the same Teutonic know-how and discipline that has long made Mercedes-Benz one of the world's most prestigious brands. However, the campaign was moth-balled in 2007. Eight years since the merger, most customers did not know that Chrysler was owned by the same company that also produces Mercedes-Benz luxury cars. Some surveyed thought Zetsche was so smooth on screen‚Äîeven to the point of head-butting a soccer ball perfectly in one take‚Äîthat he was an actor and not the actual CEO. =Chrysler sale to Cerberus 2007‚Äì2009= Second generation Chrysler Sebring sedan According to the April 2007 issue of Der Spiegel, CEO Dieter Zetsche expressed a desire to dismantle Chrysler and sell off the majority stake and at the same time keep Chrysler \\"dependent\\" upon Mercedes-Benz after the sale. On April 4, 2007, Zetsche said that the company was negotiating the sale of Chrysler, which was rumored for weeks before the announcement. The following day investor Kirk Kerkorian placed a 4.5 billion dollar bid for Chrysler. On April 12, Magna International of Canada announced it was searching for partners to place a bid for Chrysler. Magna's offer was later outbid. DaimlerChrysler AG announced on May 14, 2007 that it would sell 80.1% of its stake in the Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management for US$7.4 billion. Chrysler Group (DaimlerChrysler Corporation) would officially become Chrysler Holding LLC (changed to Chrysler LLC upon completion of the sale), with two subsidiaries ‚Äì Chrysler Motors LLC (new name of DaimlerChrysler Motors Company), which produces Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep vehicles, and Chrysler Financial Services LLC (new name of DaimlerChrysler Financial Services Americas LLC), which took over the operations of Chrysler Financial. DaimlerChrysler AG changed its name to Daimler AG. Chrysler LLC unveiled a new company logo, a variation of the previously used Pentastar logo, and launched its new website on August 6, 2007. Robert Nardelli became Chairman and CEO. In the resulting management shuffle, LaSorda was relegated to the number two position as President and Vice Chairman of Chrysler LLC, Jim Press, previously President of Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., was appointed Co-President and Vice Chairman. While LaSorda's titles at Chrysler LLC officially stated that he was in charge of manufacturing, procurement and supply, employee relations, global business development and alliances, his actual role in the company was largely to find a new partner or buyer for Chrysler. Cerberus Capital was said to be less interested in rebuilding the auto manufacturer as a long-term investment, rather it was focused on turning a short-term profit though a leveraged buyout. The new company experienced its first labor dispute on October 10, 2007. A strike deadline of 11 am had been set by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union leadership pending successful negotiation of a new contract patterned after the pact with GM. As the talks progressed past the deadline, most Chrysler unionized workers walked off their jobs. With media speculation about the impact of a long strike, an impromptu announcement after 5 pm the same day indicated that a tentative agreement had been reached, thus ending the walkout after just over six hours.

On October 24, 2008, Chrysler announced a 25% cut (5,000 jobs) in its salaried and contract workforce in November 2008. Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm announced that she, along with 5 other governors, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke requesting emergency funding for the Detroit Big Three Automakers. On the same day, General Motors asked the Treasury Department of the United States for $10 billion to help restructure both their company and possible future sibling, Chrysler so that in turn, they can become one massive company. On October 23, 2008, Daimler announced that its stake in Chrysler had a book value of zero dollars after write offs and charges. On November 5, 2008 it was published that Chrysler sales in the US market have fallen 34.9 percent in only 12 months. A week later, Chrysler CEO Robert Nardelli said, in a speech at an Ernst & Young conference, that the company can only remain viable by forming an alliance with another automaker, domestic or global, as well as receiving government assistance in the form of an equity stake. Several days later, Chrysler together with Ford and General Motors, sought financial aid at a Congressional hearing in Washington D.C. in the face of worsening conditions caused by the automotive industry crisis. All three companies were unsuccessful and were invited to draft a new action plan for the sustainability of the industry.Detroit Chiefs Plead for Aid. New York Times on November 18, 2008..

After the defeat of the auto bailout in the Senate, Chrysler stated that they would most likely file for bankruptcy and shut down all operations permanently. On December 17, 2008, Chrysler announced that it planned to halt production at all 30 of its manufacturing plants through January 19, 2009. In addition, Chrysler Financial announced that it would charge fees on dealers holding inventories of new cars and trucks that are unsold after more than 360 days, and will require immediate payment of all remaining balances on inventories of used vehicles that remain unsold after six months. On December 19, President George W. Bush announced a $13.4 billion rescue loan for the American automakers, including Chrysler.

On March 13, 2009, LaSorda told the House of Commons of Canada finance committee that the initial GM-CAW deal was insufficient and that Chrysler would demand an hourly wage cut of $20, breaking the Canadian Autoworkers's negotiating pattern set by GM. He suggested that Chrysler may withdraw from Canada if it fails to achieve more substantial cost savings from the CAW. Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne had also threatened to walk away from the merger if the CAW did not make sufficient concessions to match the wages of the \\"transplants\\" (foreign automaker's US and Canadian plants), which the union eventually agreed to by cutting benefits. Chrysler LLC has since filed for bankruptcy, though Fiat would continue to implement the strategic alliance. On March 7, 2009, Chrysler Vice-Chairman Jim Press stated that current sales volume is sufficient to keep the company going as sales should rise in the coming months. The Chrysler executive also noted the automaker's February retail sales were better than Ford's as Chrysler continued to curtail lower-margin fleet sales. He also said the volumes being forecast for 2009 are within the estimates Chrysler envisioned in preparing its viability plan for the federal government.

By mid-April, as talks intensified between the two automakers to reach an agreement by a government-imposed deadline of April 30, Fiat's initial stake was reported to be 20% with some influence on the structure of top management of the company. However, Fiat has warned that the merger would not take place if Chrysler fails to reach an agreement with the UAW and the Canadian Auto Workers' Union. On April 26, 2009, it appeared as if Chrysler had reached a deal with the unions which would meet federal requirements, though details were not made available.

Both the White House and Chrysler expressed hope for a \\"surgical\\" bankruptcy lasting 30 to 60 days, with the result of reducing the company's liabilities and post-bankruptcy emergence in stronger financial shape. The submitted court documents indicated that there would be a reorganization plan presented to the court in 120 days, on August 28, 2009. A White House official indicated that the government would provide debtor-in-possession financing for between $US 3 billion to $US 3.5 billion, and upon a completion of Chrysler bankruptcy restructuring and court proceedings, the company would be eligible to receive up to $US 4.5 billion in financing to resume operations, for total of $US 8 billion of government support. Prior to the bankruptcy filing, Chrysler had received $US 4.5 billion in financing from the U.S. government, under a George W. Bush administration plan, in December 2008, after Congress declined to approve legislation to provide federal loans. Chrysler announced on the day of the bankruptcy filing, that during the restructuring, it would cease most manufacturing operations on May 4, 2009, and resume production \\"when the transaction is completed, which is anticipated within 30 to 60 days.\\" On May 1, 2009, Chrysler LLC filed for bankruptcy, and LaSorda stepped down as President and Vice-Chairman and retired, despite Fiat urging him to stay on.

The Forward Look logo consisted of two overlapped boomerang shapes, suggesting space age rocket-propelled motion. =Pentastar= Pentastar As the Forward Look styling cycle was ending, Chrysler President Lynn Townsend sought a new logo usable by all of Chrysler's worldwide divisions and subsidiaries, automotive and non- automotive, on packaging, stationery, signage and advertising. He wanted something that would be immediately identifiable as Chrysler's mark to anyone who saw it, in any culture. In September 1962, the company adopted a logo named Pentastar, made of five triangles arranged so their bases formed the sides of a pentagon. The gaps in between the triangles formed a star in the middle of the pentagon. The Pentastar was simple and easily recognizable, even on revolving signs, and was not tied to any particular automotive styling feature as had been the previous Forward Look logo. Because the symbol contained no text, it facilitated Chrysler's expansion in international markets. The Pentastar was extensively used on dealer signage, advertisements, and promotional brochures, as well as on Chrysler products themselves. Pentastar on body cladding of 1993‚Äì98 Jeep Grand Cherokee Chrysler-Plymouth literature, advertisements, and dealership signage used a blue Pentastar or a white one on a blue background, while Dodge used a red Pentastar or a white one on a red background. Divisional logos such as Dodge's Fratzog were gradually phased out until, by 1981, all Chrysler divisions used only the Pentastar. All vehicle brands and all the other Chrysler divisions and services‚Äîair conditioning systems, heating, industrial engines, marine engines, outboard motors, boats, transmissions, four-wheel drive systems, powdered metal products, adhesives, chemical products, plastics, electronics, tanks, missiles, leasing, finance and auto parts‚Äîwere identified by the Pentastar. The Pentastar logo was placed on the lower passenger-side fender of all Chrysler products, including non-US brands, from 1963 into the 1972 model year. It was placed on the passenger-side fender so it could be viewed by passers-by, a subtle method of getting the symbol ingrained in the public's mind: a nameplate has to be read, but a symbol is quickly recognizable without reading. Thus left-hand drive cars had the Pentastar on the right fender, while right-hand drive cars had it on the left. Starting in the 1980s, hood ornaments on Chrysler-brand vehicles used a gem-like version of the pentastar to signify the brand's upscale status. The Pentastar's final badging appearance was on rare versions of the 1996 Plymouth Voyager. It was also applied to the steering wheel, keys, and fenders of the Voyager and the other Chrysler NS minivans into 2000. The Pentastar continued to represent Chrysler until the merge with Daimler in 1998, when it was retired. Among the few remaining traces of this motif was a large, star-shaped window at DaimlerChrysler's American headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and Pentastar Aviation, a former DaimlerChrysler subsidiary which reverted to its original name after being purchased by a member of the Ford family. Many dealerships still have signage and other traces still visually apparent to the Pentastar, where a five-Pentastar logo remains in use as the logo of the \\"Five Star Dealer\\" service rank. Despite having been officially retired under Daimler, the Pentastar continued to be used as the identifying trademark or logo on Chrysler Group parts, as seen on window glass, on individual components, molded plastic assemblies, and larger parts such as (reportedly) engine blocks. The Pentastar was officially reintroduced in 2007; however, was replaced with the stylized letters \\"FCA\\" for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2014. The Pentastar is also used as the badge of the United States Army's V Corps. =Return of divisional logos= Divisional logos began to supplant the companywide Pentastar application in the early 1990s. The Dodge division phased in a ram's-head logo beginning with the 1993 Intrepid and Spirit. The Chrysler brand began using a medallion based on its original logo starting with the 1995 Cirrus, Concorde, and Sebring. This logo was applied to all Chryslers by 1996. That same year, Plymouth adopted a new sailboat logo, which was a simplified version of the brand's pre-Pentastar Mayflower ship logo. =Winged logo= The design shown here is an adaptation of the original medallion logo which Chrysler used on its cars at its inception in 1925. The logo was revived for the Chrysler division in 1996, and is often surrounded by a pair of silver wings. When sold to Cerberus, Chrysler readopted the Pentastar (see above) as their corporate logo, although the winged logo is still used on the cars themselves. Revival of Pentastar Chrysler Group LLC logo On May 17, 2007, an internal email stated that Chrysler was going to revive the Pentastar logo, in updated form, after their split from Daimler. The new three-dimensional Pentastar was formally introduced when Chrysler LLC began doing business as a private company in August 2007. Chrysler cars retained a modified version of the winged logo. Elimination of the Pentastar With the formation of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2014, the stylized letters \\"FCA\\" replaced the Pentastar as the official logo. The move angered several Chrysler fans who spawned a Facebook page and a petition drive to save it.

Background The United States Air Force (USAF) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) participated in the development of the Space Shuttle from its official inception in 1969. To save money, the shuttle was intended to serve as the United States' national launch system for all civilian, military, and classified payloads.Day, Dwayne A. \\"Big Black and the new bird: the NRO and the early Space Shuttle\\" The Space Review, 11 January 2010.Day, Dwayne A. \\"The spooks and the turkey\\" The Space Review, 20 November 2006. The DoD influenced key aspects of the shuttle's design such as the size of its cargo bay,Cassutt, Michael \\"Secret Space Shuttles\\" Air & Space, 1 August 2009. and Congress reportedly told DoD that it would not pay for satellites not designed to fit into the bay. The USAF in the 1970s hoped to buy up to three shuttles and fly them with all-military crews. As with the earlier X-20 Dyna-Soar and Manned Orbiting Laboratory, budget concerns ended the \\"Blue Shuttle\\" program, but the USAF gained the use of up to one third of all launches and the right to requisition the next available launch for high-priority payloads. It renovated an existing launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to send shuttles into polar orbits and established the Manned Spaceflight Control Squadron at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Squadron personnel participated in monitoring shuttle flights from NASA's Mission Control Center, where the military built a secure facility to support classified Shuttle missions. The squadron was to move to the planned DoD mission control center in Colorado that would monitor an expected 12 to 14 flights each year. MSE Many active-duty USAF and other American military personnel have served (about 60% of the total in 1985),Blakeslee, Sandra. \\"Astronauts return from secret\\" (sic) The New York Times, 8 October 1985. and continue to serve, as NASA astronauts. Although with the end of \\"Blue Shuttle\\" DoD no longer needed its own shuttle pilots and mission specialists, it still desired military payload specialists for classified payloads on the about 100 or more shuttle flights it expected to use. While NASA offered to train the DoD astronauts the military wanted to control their training, as DoD astronauts who went to NASA rarely returned. In 1979, the first 13 Manned Spaceflight Engineers (MSEs) were selected,\\"DoD Group 1 - 1979 \\" Encyclopedia Astronautica. chosen from all services and based at Los Angeles Air Force Base: * Frank J.

Caretto * Robert B. Crombie * Frank M. DeArmond * David P. Staib, Jr. * Teresa M. Stevens The 32 MSEs were told that each would fly in space at least once. Five became generals. In 1991, Chief Warrant Officer Thomas J. Hennen, United States Army flew aboard STS-44 as the first military payload specialist since Payton and Pailes, and the first enlisted soldier in space. He was not an MSE, but he and backup Michael E. Belt were assigned to the US Army Intelligence Center at Ft. Huachuca, Arizona. Secrecy As a civilian agency, NASA typically freely provides details on all aspects of its operations. The DoD shuttle missions required different procedures to maintain secrecy of the classified payloads. The government viewed the flights and their payloads as secret as troop movements, asked media organizations to avoid reporting details, and threatened to investigate even speculation as potential leaks of classified information. The military did not disclose MSEs' names at first, unlike those chosen for Dyna-Soar and MOL, and the program's existence was secret until the press reported on it in 1982. The Air Force officially announced the MSE group's existence in 1983 but did not identify any members until 1985, and disclosed little about their role on flights. The press nonetheless reported in great detail on likely military payloads using open source intelligence, such as the direction of the shuttle after liftoff. Unlike all other flights, NASA only began public countdowns a few minutes before launch, did not distribute press kits, and did not permit reporters to attend countdowns or listen to shuttle-to-ground communications. A secure USAF-NRO mission control center (the Air Force Satellite Control Facility) in Sunnyvale, California monitored the DoD payloads on flights alongside the Houston mission control (which focused on the Shuttle and attached support equipment). NASA announced civilian shuttle missions' schedules and flight routes in advance, hundreds of civilians attended most landings, and loudspeakers played radio transmissions. Only a few reporters and NASA employees, by contrast, attended the classified flights' silent landings. Difficulties The MSE program faced internal and external challenges. NASA, which early on had a \\"sour\\" relationship with the MSEs, was reluctant to assign them to its flights given their lack of NASA training and the need for spots for other payload specialists. Payton said in 2016, \\"NASA thought of us as a bunch of snotty-nosed kids, outsiders, almost guests\\"; Hamel said that there was \\"a titanic clash of cultures (between NASA and the Air Force), and the MSEs were at the eye of the storm\\". Internal USAF debates on the usefulness of manned spaceflight to the DoD caused uncertainty for MSE personnel. USAF General Ralph G. Jacobson removed Vidrine from STS-41-C one month before launch, stating that the mission had no value to the Air Force. The military declined the opportunity to send a second MSE on STS-51-C. In New regulations in 1984 that strongly encouraged USAF personnel to move to another assignment after four years caused many early MSEs to transfer out of the program, with only nine active by late 1985. End DoD and Air Force had hoped to use 10 to 12 shuttle flights a year, but NASA could not fly the shuttle that often. By December 1984 DoD stated that it planned to use about 20% of the 70 shuttle flights NASA planned over the following five years, with almost all military-related launches moving to the shuttle from unmanned rockets. Ongoing launch delays caused DoD to express concern about overdependance on the shuttle. In 1983 Under Secretary of the Air Force and NRO director Pete Aldridge proposed that DoD continue purchasing unmanned rockets until the shuttle proved its reliability by flying 24 missions a year. In February 1984 President Ronald Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive stating that the shuttle would not be \\"fully operational\\" until 24 missions a year, perhaps by 1988. Despite Congressional and NASA opposition, in 1984 DoD began procuring a new unmanned rocket capable of launching shuttle-sized payloads into geosynchronous orbit. In 1985 it won approval to buy ten such rockets, which became the Titan IV; NASA flew nine shuttle flights that year. To improve DoD-NASA relations the space agency agreed to fly Aldridge on STS-62-A, scheduled for 1986 as the first Vandenberg shuttle mission. While training for the mission he watched on television the loss of Challenger in January 1986; the accident accelerated DoD plans for unmanned rockets, but several NRO payloads only the shuttle could launch were grounded until it flew again, a dilemma NRO had feared as early as the mid-1970s. With DoD's return to unmanned rockets and less need for dedicated military astronauts, the MSE program ended in 1988 with only two MSEs having flown into space. The Houston squadron was dissolved, construction of the Colorado center ended, and the Vandenberg launch site used for unmanned rockets.Broad, William J. \\"Pentagon Leaves the Shuttle Program\\" The New York Times, 7 August 1989.

RCS-3 produces a layered graph of processing nodes, each of which contains a task decomposition (TD), world modeling (WM), and sensory processing (SP) module. These modules are richly interconnected to each other by a communications system. RCS is not a system design, nor is it a specification of how to implement specific systems. RCS prescribes a hierarchical control model based on a set of well-founded engineering principles to organize system complexity. All the control nodes at all levels share a generic node model.NIST ISD Research areas overview. Last Updated: 5/12/2003. Accessed Aug 2, 2009. Also RCS provides a comprehensive methodology for designing, engineering, integrating, and testing control systems. Architects iteratively partition system tasks and information into finer, finite subsets that are controllable and efficient. RCS focuses on intelligent control that adapts to uncertain and unstructured operating environments. The key concerns are sensing, perception, knowledge, costs, learning, planning, and execution.  Overview  A reference model architecture is a canonical form, not a system design specification. The RCS reference model architecture combines real-time motion planning and control with high level task planning, problem solving, world modeling, recursive state estimation, tactile and visual image processing, and acoustic signature analysis. In fact, the evolution of the RCS concept has been driven by an effort to include the best properties and capabilities of most, if not all, the intelligent control systems currently known in the literature, from subsumption to SOAR, from blackboards to object-oriented programming.James S. Albus (1992). A Reference Model Architecture for Intelligent Systems Design Intelligent Systems Division, Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology. RCS (real-time control system) is developed into an intelligent agent architecture designed to enable any level of intelligent behavior, up to and including human levels of performance. RCS was inspired by a theoretical model of the cerebellum, the portion of the brain responsible for fine motor coordination and control of conscious motions. It was originally designed for sensory- interactive goal-directed control of laboratory manipulators. Over three decades, it has evolved into a real-time control architecture for intelligent machine tools, factory automation systems, and intelligent autonomous vehicles.Jim Albus, Tony Barbera, Craig Schlenoff (2004). \\"RCS: An Intelligent Agent Architecture\\" In: Proc. of 2004 AAAI Conference: Workshop on Intelligent Agent Architectures: Combining the Strengths of Software Engineering & Cognitive Systems, San Jose, CA. RCS applies to many problem domains including manufacturing examples and vehicle systems examples. Systems based on the RCS architecture have been designed and implemented to varying degrees for a wide variety of applications that include loading and unloading of parts and tools in machine tools, controlling machining workstations, performing robotic deburring and chamfering, and controlling space station telerobots, multiple autonomous undersea vehicles, unmanned land vehicles, coal mining automation systems, postal service mail handling systems, and submarine operational automation systems.  History  RCS has evolved through a variety of versions over a number of years as understanding of the complexity and sophistication of intelligent behavior has increased. The first implementation was designed for sensory-interactive robotics by Barbera in the mid 1970s.A.J. Barbera, J.S. Albus, M.L. Fitzgerald (1979). \\"Hierarchical Control of Robots Using Microcomputers\\". In: Proceedings of the 9th International Symposium on Industrial Robots, Washington, DC, March 1979. = RCS-1 = Basics of the RCS-1 control paradigm. In RCS-1, the emphasis was on combining commands with sensory feedback so as to compute the proper response to every combination of goals and states. The application was to control a robot arm with a structured light vision system in visual pursuit tasks. RCS-1 was heavily influenced by biological models such as the Marr-Albus model,J.S. Albus (1971). \\"A Theory of Cerebellar Function\\". In: Mathematical Biosciences, Vol. 10, pgs. 25‚Äì61, 1971 and the Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMAC).J.S.

CMAC becomes a state machine when some of its outputs are fed directly back to the input, so RCS-1 was implemented as a set of state-machines arranged in a hierarchy of control levels. At each level, the input command effectively selects a behavior that is driven by feedback in stimulus-response fashion. CMAC thus became the reference model building block of RCS-1, as shown in the figure. A hierarchy of these building blocks was used to implement a hierarchy of behaviors such as observed by TinbergenNico Tinbergen (1951). The Study of Instinct. Clarendon, Oxford. and others. RCS-1 is similar in many respects to Brooks' subsumption architecture,Rodney Brooks (1986). \\"A Robust Layered Control System for a Mobile Robot\\". In: IEEE Journal of Robotics and Automation. Vol. RA-2, [1], March, 1986. except that RCS selects behaviors before the fact through goals expressed in commands, rather than after the fact through subsumption. = RCS-2 = RCS-2 control paradigm. The next generation, RCS-2, was developed by Barbera, Fitzgerald, Kent, and others for manufacturing control in the NIST Automated Manufacturing Research Facility (AMRF) during the early 1980s.J.A.

The basic building block of RCS-2 is shown in the figure. The H function remained a finite state machine state-table executor. The new feature of RCS-2 was the inclusion of the G function consisting of a number of sensory processing algorithms including structured light and blob analysis algorithms. RCS-2 was used to define an eight level hierarchy consisting of Servo, Coordinate Transform, E-Move, Task, Workstation, Cell, Shop, and Facility levels of control. Only the first six levels were actually built. Two of the AMRF workstations fully implemented five levels of RCS-2. The control system for the Army Field Material Handling Robot (FMR)H.G.

National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technical Report 1235, Gaithersburg, MD, April 1989. The basic building block of RCS-3 is shown in the figure. The principal new features introduced in RCS-3 are the World Model and the operator interface. The inclusion of the World Model provides the basis for task planning and for model-based sensory processing. This led to refinement of the task decomposition (TD) modules so that each have a job assigner, and planner and executor for each of the subsystems assigned a job. This corresponds roughly to Saridis'George N. Saridis (1985). Foundations of the Theory of Intelligent Controls. IEEE Workshop on Intelligent Control, 1985 three level control hierarchy. = RCS-4 = RCS-4 control paradigm. RCS-4 is developed since the 1990s by the NIST Robot Systems Division. The basic building block is shown in the figure). The principal new feature in RCS-4 is the explicit representation of the Value Judgment (VJ) system. VJ modules provide to the RCS-4 control system the type of functions provided to the biological brain by the limbic system. The VJ modules contain processes that compute cost, benefit, and risk of planned actions, and that place value on objects, materials, territory, situations, events, and outcomes. Value state-variables define what goals are important and what objects or regions should be attended to, attacked, defended, assisted, or otherwise acted upon. Value judgments, or evaluation functions, are an essential part of any form of planning or learning. The application of value judgments to intelligent control systems has been addressed by George Pugh.G.E. Pugh, G.L. Lucas, (1980). Applications of Value-Driven Decision Theory to the Control and Coordination of Advanced Tactical Air Control Systems. Decision-Science Applications, Inc., Report No. 218, April 1980 The structure and function of VJ modules are developed more completely developed in Albus (1991).J.S. Albus (1991). \\"Outline for a Theory of Intelligence\\". In: IEEE Trans. on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics. Vol. 21, No. 3, May/June 1991. RCS-4 also uses the term behavior generation (BG) in place of the RCS-3 term task 5 decomposition (TD). The purpose of this change is to emphasize the degree of autonomous decision making. RCS-4 is designed to address highly autonomous applications in unstructured environments where high bandwidth communications are impossible, such as unmanned vehicles operating on the battlefield, deep undersea, or on distant planets. These applications require autonomous value judgments and sophisticated real-time perceptual capabilities. RCS-3 will continue to be used for less demanding applications, such as manufacturing, construction, or telerobotics for near-space, or shallow undersea operations, where environments are more structured and communication bandwidth to a human interface is less restricted. In these applications, value judgments are often represented implicitly in task planning processes, or in human operator input.  Methodology  In the figure, an example of the RCS methodology for designing a control system for autonomous onroad driving under everyday traffic conditions is summarized in six steps.James S. Albus & Anthony J. Barbera (2005). RCS: A Cognitive Architecture for Intelligent Multi-Agent Systems. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899 The six steps of the RCS methodology for knowledge acquisition and representation. * Step 1 consists of an intensive analysis of domain knowledge from training manuals and subject matter experts. Scenarios are developed and analyzed for each task and subtask. The result of this step is a structuring of procedural knowledge into a task decomposition tree with simpler and simpler tasks at each echelon. At each echelon, a vocabulary of commands (action verbs with goal states, parameters, and constraints) is defined to evoke task behavior at each echelon. * Step 2 defines a hierarchical structure of organizational units that will execute the commands defined in step 1. For each unit, its duties and responsibilities in response to each command are specified. This is analogous to establishing a work breakdown structure for a development project, or defining an organizational chart for a business or military operation. * Step 3 specifies the processing that is triggered within each unit upon receipt of an input command. For each input command, a state-graph (or statetable or extended finite state automaton) is defined that provides a plan (or procedure for making a plan) for accomplishing the commanded task. The input command selects (or causes to be generated) an appropriate state- table, the execution of which generates a series of output commands to units at the next lower echelon. The library of state-tables contains a set of statesensitive procedural rules that identify all the task branching conditions and specify the corresponding state transition and output command parameters. The result of step 3 is that each organizational unit has for each input command a state-table of ordered production rules, each suitable for execution by an extended finite state automaton (FSA). The sequence of output subcommands required to accomplish the input command is generated by situations (i.e., branching conditions) that cause the FSA to transition from one output subcommand to the next. * In step 4, each of the situations that are defined in step 3 are analyzed to reveal their dependencies on world and task states. This step identifies the detailed relationships between entities, events, and states of the world that cause a particular situation to be true. * In step 5, we identify and name all of the objects and entities together with their particular features and attributes that are relevant to detecting the above world states and situations. * In step 6, we use the context of the particular task activities to establish the distances and, therefore, the resolutions at which the relevant objects and entities must be measured and recognized by the sensory processing component. This establishes a set of requirements and/or specifications for the sensor system to support each subtask activity.  Software  Real-Time Control Systems Software.

With certain exceptions, an attorney who becomes aware that either a fellow attorney or a judge has committed an act in violation of the rules of ethical conduct must report that violation. Failure to do so subjects the attorney failing to make the report to discipline. The duty extends only to actual knowledge possessed by an attorney. An attorney who has a mere suspicion of misconduct is not required to report that suspicion, nor is the attorney required to conduct any sort of investigation to confirm or dispel that suspicion. The conduct at issue must rise to the level of misconduct under the rules of professional responsibility. Thus, an attorney who witnesses another attorney become intoxicated, engage in adultery, or gamble away a large sum of money is under no duty to report these acts because they are not prohibited by the rules of professional responsibility. Conduct that must be reported, on the other hand, includes matters such as breaching client confidentiality, misusing client funds, tampering with evidence, suborning perjury, offering bribes, and committing criminal acts of violence or dishonesty. Exceptions There are several substantial exceptions to the duty to report misconduct. First and foremost, where an attorney learns of the misconduct through a client, the duty of confidentiality to the client trumps the duty to report. The attorney must seek permission of the client to report the misconduct, and if the permission is not granted, the attorney may not report it. Moreover, if reporting the misconduct would harm the client, the attorney may not report it at all. For example, where a client who owns a restaurant tells his attorney, Jones, that a different attorney, Smith, suggested that the client bribe a health inspector, Jones may not report Smith's misconduct unless Jones first gets the client's permission. However, if the client reports that Smith not only made a suggestion that the client bribe the health inspector, but assisted the client in paying the bribe, then Jones may not report this at all because doing so would be harmful to the client. An attorney also may not report misconduct by another attorney who is the client of the first. If Smith has hired Jones to represent Smith in a legal matter, and Smith confides in Jones during the course of that representation that Smith has stolen money from clients, bribed judges, or otherwise violated the rules of professional conduct, Jones must nevertheless abide by his duty of confidentiality to Smith. Jones is therefore prohibited from reporting those violations. Finally, an attorney who learns of misconduct by another attorney through a Bar-approved substance abuse program is not required to reveal the misconduct. This is to encourage attorneys who have drug or alcohol problems to seek treatment for those problems by insuring that they may disclose misconduct prompted by their addiction in the course of seeking treatment for it.

The first hull was sold in 2008 and series production was begun in 2009. The design is an outgrowth of the success of the Esse 850 which had over 110 boats in the one-design fleet by mid-2009. The design is a very powerful sportboat capable of being raced as a daysailer or as an IMS rated coastal racer. It is a very high performance sportboat designed to be raced with a crew of 4 sailors. The design also includes a self-tacking jib to ease handling. Auxiliary propulsion is provided by a saildrive. The design is characterized by a large ballast to displacement ratio and a relatively narrow hull of 2.55 meters beam and a tall mast with a high aspect ratio sail plan. In concert with most sportboats, the Esse 990 is designed as an alternative to the complexity of traditional sloop- rigged sailboats, with an emphasis on ease of handling with a small crew and exceptional speeds. Typically, sportboat's such as the Esse 990 are much lighter and more powerful than their traditional counterparts. The reduced weight of the Esse 990 design is a result of the use of PVC-cored, epoxy/E-glass composite sections for the hull and deck. The mast and boom are made from carbon fiber to reduce weight and increase strength. The weight reduction over traditional designs means that a larger percentage of the total weight of the boat is concentrated in the keel providing greater stability and the ability to carry a larger sail plan for greater power. The weight of the entire boat is 2100 kilograms, including the hull and standing rigging. The design concentrates the righting moment of the keel in a 990 kilogram torpedo- shaped bulb at the end of an airfoil shaped fin. The ballast to displacement ratio is 0.47 which provides a \\"stiff\\" and stable platform. The high righting moment allows the design to carry a larger than normal sail area which increases power and consequently speed through the water. 250px The Esse 990 is an example of the latest design concepts in high speed hulls and sail plans. The sail plan is characterized by a large mainsail and a high aspect ratio jib in a fractional rig design. These high speed fractional rigs are a nearly ubiquitous feature on sportboat's and are used for their ease of handling and their high lift and low drag characteristics. Hull shapes on sportboat's are typically designed so that the hulls plane at high speeds. These hull designs are characterized by fairly sharp bows to allow them to penetrate waves with reduced drag and a flatter underbody aft of the bow. The flat underbody develops lift as speeds increase and the hull rises higher in the water, which reduces the wetted area and decreases drag, allowing higher speeds to be achieved. The traditional spinnaker is replaced with a gennaker that is set on an extensible bowsprit. Using a bowsprit allows the size of the gennaker to be a much larger sail than would be possible with a symmetrical spinnaker. The speeds achieved downwind by these designs can be remarkable. In the case of the Esse 990, speeds of 17 knots(19.5 mph/31.4 km/h) are readily achievable in true wind velocities greater than . 250px The Esse 990 design was selected as a finalist for the European Sport Boat Of The Year in 2009.

Farrar, Straus & Giroux) Love in the Ruins (subtitle:The Adventures of a Bad Catholic at a Time Near the End of the World) is a novel of speculative or science fiction by author Walker Percy from 1971. It follows its main character, Dr Thomas More, namesake and descendant of Sir Thomas More (author of Utopia), a psychiatrist in a small town in Louisiana called Paradise. Over time, the U.S. has become progressively more fragmented between left and right, black and white, as social trends of the 1960s run to their logical extremes. Society begins to come apart at the seams, and no one except More seems to notice, and no one, including him, seems particularly to care. More, a lapsed Catholic, alcoholic, and womanizer, invents a device that he names the Ontological Lapsometer, which can diagnose and treat the harmful mental states at the root of society's slow disintegration. However, in the wrong hands, the device can also exacerbate the problems, and a government representative, intent on getting More a Nobel Prize, seeks to put it to his own uses while More attempts to prevent a disaster. Themes The novel investigates and satirizes many facets of American society, including religion, sexuality, medical and scientific ethics, and race relations. As in many of Percy's other works, among them The Moviegoer, The Second Coming, and The Last Gentleman, the novel's protagonist suffers from alienation and existential doubt. But the protagonists' detachment from themselves allows for a lighter tone and often a comic distance from the world. Dr More's hyper- fragmented community allows for comic caricatures while still reflecting on the roots of society's problems.

Biography =Early years= Terutomo Yamazaki was born on July 31, 1947, in the village of Yamato, Yamanashi. He began the study of Kyokushin karate as a student in high school at the headquarters (honbu) of Kyokushin Kaikan at Ikebukuro, Tokyo, where founder Masutatsu ≈åyama taught. Yamazaki practiced with the senior pupils who were Shigeru ≈åyama, Yasuhiko ≈åyama (both from The World ≈åyama Karate in the United States - Shigeru is S≈çshu and Yasuhiko is Saik≈ç Shihan), Tadashi Nakamura and Hideyuki Ashihara at the time. For two and a half years Yamazaki commuted three hours from his house to the dojo, and reached the rank of shodan (1st degree black belt) on April 15, 1967. This was an unusually short time period of only two years because of his level of talent and effort. He reached the rank of nidan (2nd degree black belt) on October 10, 1967. Yamazaki instructed pupils of novice, intermediate and advanced levels at the headquarters of Kyokushin and the U.S. Army Camp Zama besides his own practice. He later said that it was good experience for him to instruct at Camp Zama as the pupils of the U.S. Army were larger than Japanese fighters. Several pupils measured over 200 centimeters in height and weighed over 90 kilograms, and practicing with these students led him to develop new ways to fight and knock out larger opponents. =Kickboxing career= Televised kickboxing was a huge boom from 1965 to 1975 when it was broadcast on the four TV stations, TBS, Nippon Television, TV Asahi and TV Tokyo all over Japan. TV Asahi requested a player from Kyokushin in February, 1969, and Masutatsu ≈åyama elected Yamazaki and Yoshiji Soeno to enter the competitions. ≈åyama also founded a kickboxing gym called Kyokushin Gym where they practiced kickboxing about two months before entering the kickboxing competitions in April, 1969. Yamazaki fought in the lightweight or welterweight division at kickboxing. At the first competition, Soeno fought Kannanpai who was one of the strongest boxers of Muay Thai and had won over Tadashi Sawamura a half a year before their match. Soeno was defeated by Kannanpai, and the next match was Yamazaki and Kannanpai. Yamazaki gained a knock out win over Kannanpai with a right cross punch in the first round.Nikkan Sports of morning newspaper, June 14, 1969. Also one of the strongest boxers of Muai Thai with knockout wins over Sawamura was Samanso from Lumpinee-ranked boxers. Samanso got knocked downs sixteen times from Sawamura, but Yamazaki fought and also knocked out Samanso in the first round.GONKAKU Remix CROSS TALK BATTLE Vol.1, p. 188‚Äì191, Nippon Sports Publishing co.,Ltd, July, 2003.Fullcontact KARATE, pp. 48‚Äì52, fukushodo, November, 1995. After these fights, Yamazaki wanted to learn Muay Thai because it is a strong and technical martial art. He was able to learn Muay Thai from the coach and the boxers at the matches. As his Muai Thai techniques improved, especially his front kick, roundhouse kick, elbow and knee (strike), he included these techniques in his karate training. The kickboxing promoters wanted to keep Yamazaki at kickboxing because Yamazaki was a strong and good- looking fighter, and he had been very popular. The promoters presented Yamazaki with good contract terms, but Yamazaki refused the offer, responding that he had never fought martial arts for the money. It was the life style of bushido that matters to his thinking. Many offers and persuasions came again and again, and finally he signed to participate in kickboxing matches. But TV Asahi stopped broadcasting kickboxing, and he returned to karate after only one year. He fought ten kickboxing matches with a record of eight knock out wins and two losses (two lost on a decision). =Full Contact Karate Open Championships career= Kyokushin was planning to hold the First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium in September 1969. It was not only a karate championship, but martial artists of various kinds also participated in this competition. Athletes included Gidon Gaddary who was an Israeli judo player weighing over 100 kilograms; Paul Jackson who was a heavyweight boxer from the United States; and three Muay Thai boxers from Lumpinee-ranked boxers including Birahon, Sakao and Samanso. The competition was fighting against other combative arts. The rules were simple: It was a foul to use a hand or elbow to the face and to attack a man's vital point. The players didn't use any protection. They fought using bare hands, bare knees and bare legs. Before the First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships, Yamazaki had thought that he had to win this championships at any cost. If he did not become a champion at the All-Japan Open Championships, Kyokushin would end there when Yamazaki or Soeno of the Kyokushin's black belt were defeated by another style of karate fighters or other martial artists. Yamazaki admitted that the mental pressure was considerable, but he dealt with the pressures. He fought six matches and won five by ippon (knock out) and one by judgment at this championships tournament, and thus became the first champion of the All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships. Yamazaki also participated in the Second, Fourth and Fifth All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships, winning 2nd place, 4th place and 2nd place, respectively. His karate training had decreased because he graduated university and began to work as a television producer after the Second All-Japan Open Championships. He had not planned to compete in the All-Japan Open Championships any further and did not enter for the Third All-Japan Open Championships. But Masutatsu ≈åyama ordered Yamazaki to participate in the Fourth All-Japan Open Championships because ≈åyama knew Yamazaki was very popular. Many of the spectators came to watch Yamazaki's fight, so at the request of ≈åyama, Yamazaki returned to competition at the Fourth All-Japan Open Championships in 1972. All concerned in Kyokushin and the mass media were surprised at Yamazaki's performance at the Fifth All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships in 1973 because he didn't have a chance to train sufficiently before the competition. But Yamazaki won five matches by strength and by overwhelming his opponents, and he came to the finals at last. His opposition was Hatsuo Royama. R≈çyama was a specialist in low roundhouse kicks and he had practiced extensively before this championship. Although Yamazaki was under-trained, the match was almost even, and R≈çyama's won only on a decision. The finals was one of the best matches ever at Kyokushin, and the story passed into history down from generation to generation. All concerned in Kyokushin and the mass media said \\"Yamazaki is a genius\\" at what he does. Though Yamazaki tried to make time to practice karate while doing television production work, it was very difficult for him to continue training for the All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships. He made a deliberate decision to retire from the All-Japan Open Championships and reported it to Masutatsu ≈åyama after the Fifth All-Japan Open Championships. Yamazaki left a steady record of wins in all of the All-Japan Open Championships in which he participated. Yamazaki said ‚ÄúI don't do professional karate. I think that makes martial arts dirty. It was good for me only in the Spirit of Kyokushin that had been cultivated for years.‚Äù It was a simple retirement. = Recent situation = After retiring from All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships, Yamazaki worked as a producer of television advertisements and a martial arts writer, while practicing karate himself on his days off. Most of his fame came from kickboxing, and there was much demand for him to open a school of karate. Yamazaki consulted with Masutatsu ≈åyama and ≈åyama obtained clearance for Yamazaki to open a karate dojo at ≈åmiya in 1977. The dojo was managed by volunteers because Yamazaki did not wish to earn money by professional karate. For this reason, the dojo was not called Kyokushin but instead Fuurinkazan (È¢®ÊûóÁÅ´Â±±) from his hometown hero Shingen Takeda. He established a Fuurinnkazan or nonprofit organization called International Budo Karate Organization Gyakushin-Kai (ÈÄÜÁúü‰ºöÈ§®) in 1995. He continues to manage this organization.  Profile  = Fighting = Yamazaki was skilled in advanced techniques and very strong and fast at the basic techniques of front kick, roundhouse kick and knee, as well as the elbow and the cross punch (gyaku zuki).Yasuhiko ≈åyama:The Champions' Fights-Kyokushin Kaikan„ÉªK-1„ÉªUSA ≈åyama, pp. 11‚Äì23, Bookman Inc., 1998. These techniques were refined by him because he integrated karate and Muay Thai. Yamazaki used his elbows and knees to defend himself. Pupils or fighters who did kumite or fought with him said \\"We always hurt our hands and legs. Yamazaki has a technique which means defense is offense.\\" =Expert breaking= Yamazaki was not only an expert at kumite, but also an expert at breaking. All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships and World Full Contact Karate Open Championships included a breaking competition as well as kumite, with players required to demonstrate breaking of cryptomeria boards. The challenge was to break the boards with bare hands, bare elbows and bare legs. Competitors could use four types of technique: punching (‚Äútsuki\\"), kicking (‚Äúkeri\\"), knifehand strike, and elbow. The winner was decided by the total number of broken cryptomeria boards. Yamazaki broke four boards by punching, seven by kicking, six by knifehand strike and seven by elbow with a total of 24, and won the breaking championship at the Fifth All-Japan Open Championships in 1973. This record was not broken for a while, but it was exceeded in total breaking and reached a new height with Willie Williams, a karateka from the United States, at the Second World Full Contact Karate Open Championships in 1979. He broke five boards by punching, six by kicking, eight by knifehand strike, and seven by elbow with a total of 26. Williams won 3rd place in kumite, as well. However, all concerned in Kyokushin and the mass media pointed out that Williams was 196 centimeters in height and 100 kilogram in weight, while Yamazaki was 177 centimeters in height and 62 kilograms in weight with a difference of almost 40 kilograms, while the number of the broken boards was only different by two. Yamazaki proved his skill and talent eminently. = Teaching = Yamazaki was not only a strong fighter but also became a respected teacher. Some fighters who have benefited by studying under Yamazaki are Katsuaki Sat≈ç, Miyuki Miura, Seiji Isobe (teacher of Glaube Feitosa, Francisco Filho and Andrews Nakahara), Howard Collins, Toshikazu Sat≈ç (champion of the Eighth All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships),Gekkann Power Karate, page48, Power Karate Shuppannsha, March, 1989. Takashi Azuma (champion of the Ninth All-Japan Open Championships),Gekkann Fullcontact karate separate volume - Masutatsu ≈åyama & The Strong men of Kyokushin Kaikan, page52, fukushodo, 1995. Makoto Nakamura (Two times champions of the Second and Third World Full Contact Karate Open Championships)What is Kyokushin?, page149, Wani Magazine Inc., 1996. and Shokei Matsui.Futoshi Kitanoguchi:Ichigekinoken-Shokei Matsui, page75-80, page214, Koudansha, 2005. They are unanimous in their respect for Yamazaki.  Anecdotes  Masutatsu ≈åyama often summoned Yamazaki to the headquarters of Kyokushin. Because Yamazaki speaks his mind to everyone frankly, ≈åyama liked Yamazaki's personality. ≈åyama and Yamazaki had discussed the method of the organizational operation for quite a while before ≈åyama's death. After the First World Full Contact Karate Open Championships in 1975, Yamazaki visited Shigeru ≈åyama's dojo at White Plains, New York. Shigeru was the Saik≈ç-shihan (the top instructor) of Kyokushin at that time. Shigeru talked about when Yamazaki practiced with Shigeru's pupils. \\"My pupils were very surprised to see Yamazaki's fighting. His footwork is sharp and light. All of his techniques are fast, containing a lot of destructive power, and they thought it looked very fine.

The plant, established by Pinhas Rutenberg, produced much of the energy consumed in Mandatory Palestine until the 1948 Palestine war.

A railway bridge was built parallel to it in the early 20th century to carry to Jezreel Valley railway, opened in 1905. The bridge played a strategic role in World War I; it was captured by the 19th Lancers during the Capture of Afulah and Beisan. When the Rutenberg concession was given, it was defined as the area around Jisr Majami. =Hydroelectric power station= First Jordan Hydro-Electric Power House, circa 1933 Pinhas Rutenberg, a Russian-born Zionist and engineer immigrated to Palestine in 1919. After submitting a plan to the Zionist movement for the establishment of 13 hydroelectric power stations and securing financing for the plan, he was awarded a concession from the British Mandatory government to generate electricity, first from the Yarkon River near Tel Aviv, and shortly thereafter, utilizing all the running water in western Palestine. Naharayim is part of 6,000 dunams sold to the Palestine Electric Corporation (PEC) run by Pinhas Rutenberg. The Naharayim site was chosen for the strong water flow and the possibility of regulating the flow through storage in the Sea of Galilee during the winter rainy season and release of the water reserves in the summer. Construction began in 1927 and continued for five years, providing employment for 3,000 workers. The site was named Naharayim, Hebrew for \\"Two Rivers.\\" =Workers' village= Homes in the workers village, 1932/1933 A residential neighborhood was built near the plant to house employees.Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel, ed. Raphael Patai, Herzl Press/McGraw Hill, New York, Vol. 2, p.818 It was the only Jewish village in Transjordan at the time. It was designated for residence of the permanent employees of the power plant and their families, aiming to create an agricultural village at the Eastern border of the Land of Israel. Employees of the power station also farmed thousands of dunams of land and sold some of the produce at a company workers‚Äô supermarket in Haifa.The Humble Beginnings of Israel Electric Corporation, Revealed Due to its relative isolation and despite the limited number of resident families, the village included a clinic, a kindergarten, and even a school, established by Yosef Hanani for the children of employees. The families of the employees at Tel Or were evacuated from the settlement in April 1948, leaving behind only workers with Jordanian ID cards. Following a prolonged battle between Palestinian Jewish forces and the Transjordanian Arab Legion in the area, the remaining residents of Tel Or were given an ultimatum to surrender or leave the village. Tel Or was abandoned by the residents, who were evacuated to Jewish-controlled areas across the river. During the 1948 War, 70 Palestinian Arab families from a village just meters away on the Palestinian side of the Jordan River populated the abandoned site. =1947/8 diplomacy= In the lead up to the End of the British Mandate for Palestine and Israeli independence, Naharayim was the venue for a meeting between Golda Meir and King Abdullah on 17 November 1947. There was a second meeting in Amman on 10 May, 1948, after the Gesher incident (see below), in an attempt by the Jewish leadership to head off Jordanian participation in the war.Fabricating Israeli History: The \\"new Historians\\", Frank Cass, Efraim Karsh, page 98The War for Palestine: Rewriting the History of 1948, Cambridge University Press, chapter by Eugene Rogan, page 84 =1948 war= 1940s Survey of Palestine map of the area On 27 April 1948, in violation of a November 1947 agreement between Golda Meir and King Abdullah, the Arab Legion's 4th Battalion launched a mortar and artillery attack on the Naharayim police fort and Kibbutz Gesher (on the Palestinian side of the border). On the evening of 27 April, the Legion began shelling the fort and kibbutz, stepping up the attack the following day. Many of the kibbutz buildings were destroyed. On the morning of April 29, a Legion officer demanded the evacuation of the fort, but was turned down. After protests to the British Mandate administration, the shelling was halted, and Abdullah was reprimanded for \\"aggression against Palestine territory.\\" Although the attack did constitute a violation of the understanding, a British officer of the Legion claimed afterwards that it was an unfortunate local misunderstanding. The impetus for the attack was the seizure by the settlers of the police fortress which the British had invited Glubb Pasha to take over. The settlement would have fallen except that Abdullah told his son Talal to halt the attack.The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews, Benny Morris In the wake of the attack 50 children of the kibbutz were evacuated, first to the Ravitz Hotel on the Carmel,The Outsider. Haaretz and then to a 19th-century French monastery on the grounds of Rambam Hospital in the Bat Galim neighborhood of Haifa, where they lived for the next 22 months.70th anniversary, Rambam Hospital An Iraqi brigade invaded at Naharayim on May 15, 1948, in an unsuccessful attempt to take the kibbutz and fort.The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews The power plant was occupied and looted by the Iraqi forces.Jewish-Transjordanian Relations 1921-1948, Yoav Gelber To prevent Iraqi tanks from attacking Jewish villages in the Jordan Valley, the sluice gates of the Degania dam were opened. The rush of water, which deepened the river at this spot, was instrumental in blocking the Iraqi- Jordanian incursion. 1949 armistice line Armistice line as shown on the official map Although the 1949 Israel-Jordan armistice agreement did not explicitly mention this region, the map attached to the agreement showed the armistice line cutting off a corner of Jordan between the two rivers (the present day Island of Peace). When Israel sent military forces into this corner in August 1950, Jordan filed a complaint with the United Nations Security Council.Cablegram dated 10 September 1950 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Hashimite Kingdom of the Jordan addressed to the Secretary-General concerning the Palestine question, UNSC document S/1780.Letter dated 21 September 1950 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Hashimite Kingdom of the Jordan addressed to the Secretary-General concerning the Palestine question, UNSC document S/1824. According to Jordan, the map had been improperly altered from the original agreed by the parties, was inadequately signed, and in any case the armistice agreement was never intended to alter the territory of Jordan. Israel responded that it was immaterial how the map came to be how it was, as only the final version was binding. The Security Council then questioned Ralph Bunche, who had been the UN mediator at the armistice negotiations at Rhodes.United Nations Security Council, 518th Meeting, 6 November 1950, Proces-Verbaux No. 60, document number S/PV.518.. He said that the parties had brought map overlays to Rhodes from earlier informal negotiations and they were transferred manually onto a 1:250,000 map (shown right). He could not explain why a part of Jordan had been cut off and was sure it had not been brought up in the formal meetings. However, his opinion was that although the region remained sovereign Jordanian territory it was on the Israeli side of the armistice line because the map was an integral part of the agreement which both parties had signed. Peace treaty and property rights The 1994 peace treaty included a photo-map of the area in its appendix Two kibbutzim, Ashdot Ya'akov Meuhad and Ashdot Ya'akov Ihud, worked some 820 dunams on an island (present day Island of Peace) that was part of PEC land, which was in Israeli hands following the signing of the 1949 armistice agreement. The bulk of the 6,000 dunams, including the destroyed plant, remained in Jordanian hands and were placed under the Guardian of Enemy Property. In the 1994 Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty, Jordanian sovereignty over the 820 dunam area was confirmed, but Israelis retained private land ownership and special provisions allow free Israeli travel and protect Israeli property rights.Fischbach, Michael R. \\"Settling Historical Land Claims in the Wake of Arab-Israeli Peace.\\" Journal of Palestine Studies 27.1 (1997): 38-50.

Corbett was one of the leaders of a regionalist architecture movement along with Joseph Esherick, Gardner Dailey, Campbell & Wong and Warren Callister. Bull began his studies at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in aeronautical engineering, and switched to architecture after the first year. Bull studied with Ralph Rapson, Buckminster Fuller, Alvar Aalto, and graduated in 1952. As a first lieutenant in the USAF, Bull was stationed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and worked with Buckminster Fuller on developing the geodesic radar domes for the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line) system at the north slope of Alaska. In 1954, Bull returned to San Francisco to work again with Mario Corbett. On the basis of being commissioned to design several ski cabins,Cabins and Vacation Houses, Sunset Book, different cabins are featured p.12-13, p.18-19, p.22-23, p.26-27. Bull opened his own architectural office in 1956. Bull's early practice included homes, condominiums and later hotels and institutional buildings. Sunset Magazine published articles on Bull, twice putting his projects on the cover of their magazine, giving him numerous design awards, and enlisting him as a competition judge. In 1962, he was chosen to design the Sunset Magazine Discovery House: a \\"dream house\\" limited to . Bull designed the home as a series of four skylit pavilions built around an enclosed courtyard. It was the first home built in the newly established town of El Dorado Hills.Sunset Magazine, cover and article, November 1962 In the 1950s and the 1960s, Henrik Bull designed several prefabricated or kit cabins. He built the very first A-Frame ski cabin in the United States with his friend John Flender in Stowe, Vermont in 1953.A-Frame Chad Randl, p.61 to 67 The essence of a good cabin, according to Bull, is that it should be simple and economical, but also fun, different and exciting.\\"A piercing look at Vacation House Design, an interview with Henrik Bull, A.I.A.\\" in Building Product Guide #24 of Spring/Summer 1969 In 1967, Henrik Bull, John Field, Sherwood Stockwell and Daniel Volkmann formed Bull Field Volkmann Stockwell. Their first large project together was the planning and architecture for Northstar at Tahoe, a new four season resort.The Story of Modern Skiing, John Fry The firm has continued under the following names: Bull Field Volkmann Stockwell ; Bull Volkmann Stockwell ; Bull Stockwell Allen ; Bull Stockwell Allen & Ripley ; and is now called Bull Stockwell Allen / BSA Architects.  Ideological position  Bull directly related his design philosophy to the \\"Bay Area Style\\" (also called \\"Bay Region School\\").Bay Area Houses, p.274 to 279 This movement is a continuation of an earlier period of architecture practiced by such people as Bernard Maybeck, Julia Morgan, Greene & Greene, Willis Polk and Ernest Coxhead who were influenced by the British Arts and Crafts Movement as well as the Japanese architecture. Because Bull believed that modern architecture should be warm as well as really sensitive to the topography and climate, he was classified both in the Northern California Modernism and the Bay Area Style. The question of an appropriate architecture for its location was always Henrik Bull‚Äôs main concern. He felt that a building of quality did not unnecessarily disturb the site and should be comprehensible to everyone.Modern Houses, Sherban Cantacuzino, p.35 to 37 Buildings should expose frankly their structures and be designed in relation to the climate, so that outdoor living spaces are a continuation of the interior. According to Henrik Bull, the timeless value of architecture should be achieved in choosing natural materials appropriate to the site, crafting them well and being conscious of the effect of time and weather so the building can become richer with time. Creating lasting architecture is also achieved by placing priority on client needs and relationship to the site. This should form a triangular relationship: the human with the building, the building with the site, and the human with the site.\\"Regionalism: an Architecture of Tradition\\", by Jean Suyul Chu, Master of Architecture Thesis at UC Berkeley in 1989, p.19 to 22  Awards and recognition  Bull received 43 major design awards for work he personally designed, or under his direct design leadership. In 1978, Bull Field Volkmann Stockwell won an invited competition for planning the proposal new capital city of Alaska with Bull as co-principal in charge. The firm received 75 major design awards including the Firm Award from the AIA California Council in 1989, \\"in recognition of distinguished architecture in a form‚Äôs overall body of work\\".  Activities and public service  Bull was elected Vice President (1967) and President (1968) of the American Institute of Architects / San Francisco Chapter (AIA SF), and elected to Fellowship in National AIA in 1969. He was also part of the National AIA‚Äôs Committees (Housing Committee in 1967; and Scholarship Committee in 1974). His other activities included: Golden Gate Bridge Design Review Committee (1997 to 2001), President of the Architectural Heritage Association of Berkeley (1975), Citizen Advisory Committee for the San Francisco Urban Design Plan (1970), MIT Education Council (1960 to 1989), and architect representative on the Seismic Investigation and Hazards Survey Advisory Committee of San Francisco (1981‚Äì1985).

It follows the experiences of an unnamed protagonist struggling with insomnia. Inspired by his doctor's exasperated remark that insomnia is not suffering, the protagonist finds relief by impersonating a seriously ill person in several support groups. Then he meets a mysterious man named Tyler Durden and establishes an underground fighting club as radical psychotherapy. In 1999, director David Fincher adapted the novel into a film of the same name, starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. The film acquired a cult following despite underperforming financially. The film's prominence heightened the profile of the novel and that of Palahniuk. The sequel Fight Club 2 was released in comic book form in May 2015. Fight Club 3 was released in comic book form in 2019. Plot Fight Club centers on an anonymous narrator, who works as a product recall specialist for an unnamed car company. Because of the stress of his job and the jet lag brought upon by frequent business trips, he begins to suffer from recurring insomnia. When he seeks treatment, his doctor advises him to visit a support group for testicular cancer victims to \\"see what real suffering is like\\". He finds that sharing the problems of others‚Äîdespite not having testicular cancer himself‚Äîalleviates his insomnia. The narrator's unique treatment works until he meets Marla Singer, another \\"tourist\\" who visits the support group under false pretenses. The possibly disturbed Marla reminds the narrator that he is a faker who does not belong there. He begins to hate Marla for keeping him from crying, and, therefore, from sleeping. After a confrontation, the two agree to attend separate support group meetings to avoid each other. The truce is uneasy, and the narrator's insomnia returns. While on a nude beach, the narrator meets Tyler Durden, a charismatic extremist of mysterious means. After an explosion destroys the narrator's condominium, he asks to stay at Tyler's house. Tyler agrees, but asks for something in return: \\"I want you to hit me as hard as you can.\\"Palahniuk, Fight Club, 1999, p. 46. Both men find that they enjoy the ensuing fistfight. They subsequently move in together and establish a \\"fight club\\", drawing numerous men with similar temperaments into bare-knuckle fighting matches, set to the following rules: Later in the book, a mechanic tells the narrator about two new rules of the fight club: nobody is the center of the fight club except for the two men fighting, and the fight club will always be free. Marla, noticing that the narrator has not recently attended his support groups, calls him to claim that she has overdosed on Xanax in a half-hearted suicide attempt. Tyler returns from work, picks up the phone to Marla's drug- induced rambling, and rescues her. Tyler and Marla embark on an uneasy affair that confounds the narrator and confuses Marla. Throughout this affair, Marla is unaware both of fight club's existence and the interaction between Tyler and the narrator. Because Tyler and Marla are never seen at the same time, the narrator wonders whether Tyler and Marla are the same person. As fight club attains a nationwide presence, Tyler uses it to spread his anti-consumerist ideas, recruiting fight club's members to participate in increasingly elaborate pranks on corporate America. He eventually gathers the most devoted fight club members and forms \\"Project Mayhem\\", a cult-like organization that trains itself as an army to bring down modern civilization. This organization, like fight club, is controlled by a set of rules: While initially a loyal participant in Project Mayhem, the narrator becomes uncomfortable with the increasing destructiveness of its activities. He resolves to stop Tyler and his followers when Bob, a friend from the testicular cancer support group, is killed during one of Project Mayhem's sabotage operations. The narrator then learns that he himself is Tyler Durden. As the narrator's mental state deteriorated, his mind formed a new personality that was able to escape from the problems of his life. Marla inadvertently reveals to the narrator that he and Tyler are the same person. Tyler's affair with Marla‚Äîwhom the narrator professes to dislike‚Äîwas the narrator's own affair with Marla. The narrator's bouts of insomnia had been Tyler's personality surfacing; Tyler was active whenever the narrator was \\"sleeping\\". The Tyler personality not only created fight club, he also blew up the Narrator's condo. Tyler plans to blow up a skyscraper using homemade bombs created by Project Mayhem; the target of the explosion is the nearby national museum. Tyler plans to die as a martyr during this event, taking the narrator's life as well. Realizing this, the narrator sets out to stop Tyler, although Tyler is always thinking ahead of him. The narrator makes his way to the roof of the building, where Tyler holds him at gunpoint. When Marla comes to the roof with one of the support groups, Tyler vanishes, as Tyler \\"was his hallucination, not hers.\\"Palahniuk, Fight Club, 1999, p. 195. With Tyler gone, the narrator waits for the bomb to explode and kill him. The bomb malfunctions because Tyler mixed paraffin into the explosives. Still alive and holding Tyler's gun, the narrator makes the first decision that is truly his own: he puts the gun in his mouth and shoots himself. Some time later, he awakens in a mental hospital, believing he is in Heaven, and imagines an argument with God over human nature. The book ends with the narrator being approached by hospital employees who reveal themselves to be Project members. They tell him their plans still continue, and that they are expecting Tyler to come back.  History  Palahniuk once had an altercation while camping,Jemielity, Sam. \\"Chuck Palahniuk:The Playboy.comversation\\" and though he returned to work bruised and swollen, his co-workers avoided asking him what had happened on the camping trip. Their reluctance to know what happened in his private life inspired him to write Fight Club. In 1995, Palahniuk joined a Portland-based writing group that practiced a technique called \\"dangerous writing\\". This technique, developed by American author Tom Spanbauer, emphasizes the use of minimalist prose, and the use of painful, personal experiences for inspiration. Under Spanbauer's influence, Palahniuk produced an early draft of what would later become his novel Invisible Monsters (1999), but it was rejected by all publishers he submitted it to. Palahniuk then wrote a second novel, expanding on his short story, \\"Fight Club\\".\\"Palahniuk, Chuck (1962-), An Introduction to.\\" Contemporary Literary Criticism. Ed. Lawrence J. Trudeau. Vol. 359. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale, 2014. Contemporary Literary Criticism Online. Web. 30 Mar. 2016. pp. 253-342. http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=ZHWHGQ544011662&v;=2.1&u;=cwru_main‚Å¢=r&p;=LCO&sw;=w&asid;=0eaf86a3b8cd35ead5328890e6b88bfc Initially Fight Club was published as a seven-page short story in the compilation Pursuit of Happiness (1995), but Palahniuk expanded it to novel length (in which the original short story became chapter six); Fight Club: A Novel was published in 1996. Fight Club: A Novel was re-issued in 1999 and 2004; the latter edition includes the author's introduction about the conception and popularity of the novel and movie, in which Palahniuk states: > ...bookstores were full of books like The Joy Luck Club and The Divine > Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood and How to Make an American Quilt. These > were all novels that presented a social model for women to be together. But > there was no novel that presented a new social model for men to share their > lives.Palahniuk, 1997, p. XVI He later explains: > Really, what I was writing was just The Great Gatsby updated a little. It > was 'apostolic' fiction‚Äîwhere a surviving apostle tells the story of his > hero. There are two men and a woman. And one man, the hero, is shot to > death.Palahniuk, 1997, p. XVII One critic has noted that this essay can be seen as Palahniuk's way of interpreting his own novel. According to this critic, Palahniuk's essay emphasizes the communicative and romantic elements of the novel while it deemphasizes its transgressive elements.Jensen, Mikkel. 2014. \\"\\"There had to be some kind of chorus\\": Re-interpretation by Postscript in Fight Club\\" in Le Post-scriptum ou la rh√©torique de l'ajout (eds. Christelle Ser√©e-Chaussinand & Sylvie Crinquand) Lyon: Merry World √âditions Productions. In interviews, the writer has said he is still approached by people wanting to know the location of the nearest fight club. Palahniuk insists there is no such real organization. He has heard of real fight clubs, some said to have existed before the novel. Project Mayhem is lightly based on The Cacophony Society, of which Palahniuk is a member, and other events derived from stories told to him.Palahniuk, Stranger Than Fiction: True Stories, pp. 228‚Äì229. Fight Clubs cultural impact is evidenced by the establishment of fight clubs by teenagers and \\"techies\\" in the United States.\\"Fight club draws techies for bloody underground beatdowns\\". Associated Press. May 29, 2006. Pranks, such as food- tampering, have been repeated by fans of the book, documented in Palahniuk's essay \\"Monkey Think, Monkey Do\\",Palahniuk, Stranger Than Fiction: True Stories, pp. 212‚Äì215. in the book Stranger Than Fiction: True Stories (2004) and in the introduction to the 2004 re-issue of Fight Club. Other fans have been inspired to undertake prosocial activity, and told Palahniuk that the novel had encouraged them to return to college.Tomlinson, Sarah. \\"Is it fistfighting, or just multi-tasking?\\". Salon.com. October 13, 1999. Adaptations In addition to the feature film, a stage adaptation by Dylan Yates has been performed in Seattle and in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 2004, work began on a musical theater adaptation by Palahniuk, Fincher, and Trent Reznor, to premiere on the film's 10th anniversary. In 2015 the project was still in development, with Julie Taymor having been added to the creative team.  Characters  = The Narrator = A modern-day everyman figure as well as an employee specializing in recalls for an unnamed car company, the Narrator‚Äîwho remains unnamed throughout the novel‚Äîis extremely depressed and suffers from insomnia. Some readers call him \\"Joe\\", because of his constant use of the name in such statements as, \\"I am Joe's boiling point\\". The quotes, \\"I am Joe's [blank]\\", refer to the Narrator's reading old Reader's Digest articles in which human organs write about themselves in the first person, with titles such as \\"I Am Joe's Liver\\". The film adaptation replaces \\"Joe\\" with \\"Jack\\", inspiring some fans to call the Narrator \\"Jack\\". In the novel and film, the Narrator uses various aliases in the support groups. His subconscious is in need of a sense of freedom, he inevitably feels trapped within his own body, and when introduced to Tyler Durden, he begins to see all of the qualities he lacks in himself: \\"I love everything about Tyler Durden, his courage, his smarts, and his nerve. Tyler is funny and forceful and independent, and men look up to him and expect him to change their world. Tyler is capable and free, and I am not.\\"Palahniuk, Fight Club, 1999, p. 174. In the official sequel comic book series also penned by Palahniuk (with art by Cameron Stewart), Fight Club 2, it is revealed that the Narrator has chosen to be identified by the name of Sebastian.Fight Club 2 #1, Chuck Palahniuk & Cameron Stewart, Dark Horse Comics, May 2015 = Tyler Durden = \\"Because of his nature\\",Palahniuk, Fight Club, 1999, p. 25. Tyler works night jobs where he sabotages companies and harms clients. He also steals left-over drained human fat from liposuction clinics to supplement his income through soap making and to create the ingredients for bomb manufacturing, which will be put to work later with his fight club. He is the co-founder of Fight Club, as it was his idea to instigate the fight that led to it. He later launches Project Mayhem, from which he and the members commit various attacks on consumerism. Tyler is blond, according to the Narrator's comment \\"in his everything-blond way\\". The unhinged but magnetic Tyler becomes the \\"villain\\" of the novel later in the story. The Narrator refers to Tyler as a free spirit who says, \\"Let that which does not matter truly slide.\\" = Marla Singer = A woman whom the Narrator meets during a support group. The Narrator no longer receives the same release from the groups when he realizes Marla is faking her problems just as he is. After he leaves the groups, he meets her again when she becomes Tyler's lover. Marla is shown to be extremely unkempt, uncaring, and sometimes even suicidal. At times, she shows a softer, more caring side. = Robert \\"Big Bob\\" Paulson = The Narrator meets Bob at a support group for testicular cancer. A former bodybuilder, Bob lost his testicles to cancer caused by the steroids he used to bulk up his muscles. He had to undergo testosterone injections, resulting in increased estrogen. The increased estrogen levels caused him to grow large breasts and to develop a softer voice. Because of his \\"bitch tits\\", Bob is the only known member who is allowed to wear a shirt. The Narrator befriends Bob and, after leaving the groups, meets him again in fight club. Bob's death later in the story, while carrying out an assignment for Project Mayhem, causes the Narrator to turn against Tyler because the members of Project Mayhem treat it as a trivial matter instead of a tragedy. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/?ref_=nv_sr_1 = Angel Face = A man who joins Fight Club. He is very loyal to Project Mayhem, laughing at the vandalism he and a group of \\"space monkeys\\" have caused as their crimes appear on the evening news. Angel Face is considered very beautiful, hence his name. The blond-haired beauty suffers a savage beating at the Narrator's hands during a Fight Club session; the Narrator states that he \\"wanted to destroy something beautiful.\\" The next time Angel Face is heard of in the novel, he is described as not being quite as beautiful anymore. Whereas in the book it is that excessive beating which triggers the foundation of Project Mayhem (Fight Club no longer being a sufficient outlet), in the movie the beating seems to be caused primarily by the Narrator's jealousy.  Motifs  At two points in the novel, the Narrator claims he wants to \\"wipe [his] ass with the Mona Lisa\\"; a mechanic who joins fight club repeats this to him in one scene.Palahniuk, Fight Club, 1999, pp. 124, 141 & 200. This motif shows his desire for chaos, later expressed by the Narrator as an urge to \\"destroy something beautiful\\". Additionally, he mentions at one point that \\"Nothing is static. Even the Mona Lisa is falling apart.\\"Palahniuk, Fight Club, 1999, p. 49. This is most explicitly stated in the scene the mechanic appears in: Kennett further argues that Tyler wants to use this chaos to change history so that \\"God's middle children\\" will have some historical significance, whether or not this significance results in \\"damnation or redemption\\".Kennett, pp. 51‚Äì52. These endeavours will figuratively return to them their absent fathers, as judgment by future generations will replace judgment by their fathers. After seeing Reader's Digest articles written from the perspective of the organs of a man named Joe, the Narrator begins using similar quotations to describe his feelings. He often replaces organs with feelings and things involved in his life (such as \\"I am Joe's smirking revenge\\"). Cornflower blue is a color associated with the Narrator's boss; it is revealed that he chose that particular shade of blue to highlight an icon. It is also mentioned later on that the Narrator's boss has eyes which are exactly the same color. All of Palahniuk's subsequent novels have featured references to cornflower blue. Isolationism, specifically directed towards material items and possessions, is a common theme throughout the novel. Tyler acts as the major catalyst behind the destruction of our vanities, which he claims is the path to finding our inner selves. \\"I'm breaking my attachment to physical power and possessions,\\" Tyler whispered, \\"because only through destroying myself can I discover the greater power of my spirit.\\"  Themes  Jesse Kavadlo, a professor at Maryville University of St. Louis, argues that the Narrator's opposition to emasculation is a form of projection, and the problem that he fights is himself.Kavadlo, p. 5. He also argues that Palahniuk uses existentialism in the novel to conceal subtexts of feminism and romance, in order to convey these concepts in a novel that is mainly aimed at a male audience.Kavadlo, p. 7. In an essay titled \\"Fight Club and the Disneyfication of Manhood,\\" Cameron White and Trenia Walker suggest that Project Mayhem's ultimate goal, through the destruction of financial institutions, is to shatter what society deems \\"real\\" manhood, reducing manhood to survival instincts. Paul Skinner has also echoed this sentiment, stating, \\"the anger and dissatisfaction of the male characters is against one type of masculinity being suppressed by post- industrial consumerist society\\".Skinner, Paul. Fighting for Their Place: Constructing Masculinity in Chuck Palahniuk's Fight Club. Thesis. University of Nebraska, 2011. Ann Arbor: Proquest LLC, 2011. Palahniuk gives a simpler assertion about the theme of the novel, stating \\"all my books are about a lonely person looking for some way to connect with other people.\\"Palahniuk, Stranger Than Fiction: True Stories, p. xv. Paul Kennett argues that because the Narrator's fights with Tyler are fights with himself, and because he fights himself in front of his boss at the hotel, the Narrator is using the fights as a way of asserting himself as his own boss. These fights are a representation of the struggle of the proletarian at the hands of a higher capitalist power; by asserting himself as capable of having the same power he thus becomes his own master. Later when fight club is formed, the participants are all dressed and groomed similarly, allowing them to symbolically fight themselves at the club and gain the same power.Kennett, pp. 53‚Äì54. Tyler becomes nostalgic for patriarchal power giving him control and creates Project Mayhem to achieve this. Through this proto-fascist power structure, the Narrator seeks to learn \\"what, or rather, who, he might have been under a firm patriarchy.\\"Kennett, p. 55. Through his position as leader of Project Mayhem, Tyler uses his power to become a \\"God/Father\\" to the \\"space monkeys\\" (the other members of Project Mayhem), although by the end of the novel his words hold more power than he does, as is evident in the space monkeys' threat to castrate the Narrator when he contradicts Tyler's rule. According to Kennett, this creates a paradox in that Tyler pushes the idea that men who wish to be free from a controlling father-figure are only self-actualized once they have children and become a father themselves, thus becoming controllers themselves in an endless cycle of patriarchal repression.Kennett, p. 56. Johannes Hell argues that Palahniuk's use of the Narrator's somnambulism is a simple attempt at emphasizing the dangerous yet daring possibilities of life. Hell enforces the importance of the Narrator's sleepwalking and intense deprivation, for they have a firm influence on suffering readers,\\"Hell, p.3. from a twisted perspective this is solace for everybody who suffers from somnambulism in a sense, that things could be worse, much worse in fact.Hell, p.3. Project Mayhem's terrorism in Fight Club has been analyzed within the context of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. In 2007, Ruth Quiney examined this link, stating that Fight Club's depiction of disaffected Western men joining a homegrown terrorist group anticipated some aspects of the War on Terror. Jesse Kavadlo, in his essay \\"With Us or Against Us: Chuck Palahniuk's 9/11,\\" claims that Palahniuk was almost prophetic in predicting future acts of terror. He writes, \\"Palahniuk's work demonstrates the disturbing intersections between the multiple meanings of the word \\"plot\\": narrative, conspiratorial, and funereal, the word reminding us of the linguistic connections between our stories, our secrets, and our entombment.\\"Kavadlo, Jesse. \\"With Us or Against Us: Chuck Palahniuk's 9/11\\". Reading Chuck Palahniuk: American Monsters and Literary Mayhem. Ed. Cynthia G. Kuhn and Lance Rubin. New York: Routledge, 2009. Print. pp. 103-116.  Reception  At the time of its publication, Fight Club was well-received critically. It was called \\"brilliantly creepy\\" by The Washington Post, and \\"unsettling and nerve-chafing\\" by The Seattle Times. The Baltimore Sun commended its very publication, stating, \\"bravo to Norton for having the courage to publish it.\\" For many critics, Fight Club is considered the embodiment of Palahniuk's writing style and thematic concerns. The \\"forecasts\\" section of a 1996 Publishers Weekly praised the novel: > Writing in an iconic deadpan and including something to offend everyone, > Palahniuk is a risky writer who takes chances galore, especially with a > particularly bizarre plot twist he throws in late in the book. Caustic, > outrageous, bleakly funny, violent, and always unsettling, Palahniuk's > utterly original creation will make even the most jaded reader sit up and > take notice. Some critics have condemned Fight Club because of its violent, heteronormative themes and cult philosophy. Peter Matthews, however, argues that these critics often overlook the novel's ironic critique of its characters' violent worldview. The book received critical interest and eventually generated cinematic-adaptation interest. In 1999, screenwriters Jim Uhls, August Olsen, and co-producers Conor Strait and Aaron Curry joined director David Fincher. The film \\"failed\\" at the box office,Linson, Art (Fight Club producer), What Just Happened?: Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line (New York: Grove Press, 2008) pp. 125‚Äì127. but a cult following emerged with the DVD edition and as a result, an original, hardcover edition of the novel is now a collector's item.Offman, Craig. \\"Movie makes \\"Fight Club\\" book a contender \\". Salon.com. September 3, 1999. Following its film adaptation, the novel gained popularity among young, male American readers. Critics have attributed Fight Club's popularity with this audience to its critique of an emasculating consumerist culture, and to the implied message that modern men need revert to their primal, aggressive nature. The Evening Standard said the novel was the origin of the term \\"snowflake\\". \\"I coined 'snowflake' and I stand by it\\", Palahniuk said in 2017. \\"Every generation gets offended by different things but my friends who teach in high school tell me that their students are very easily offended ... The modern Left is always reacting to things. Once they get their show on the road culturally they will stop being so offended.\\"  Awards  The novel won the following awards: * the 1997 Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association AwardPacific Northwest Booksellers Association Awards. .

Sequels Palahniuk was convinced to continue Fight Club in comics form by fellow novelist Chelsea Cain and comic writers Brian Michael Bendis, Matt Fraction and Kelly Sue DeConnick. Orbital in Conversation with Chuck Palahniuk At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Palahniuk announced that a sequel to Fight Club is in the works and will take the form of a serialized graphic novel. According to Palahniuk, \\"It will likely be a series of books that update the story ten years after the seeming end of Tyler Durden. Nowadays, Tyler is telling the story, lurking inside Sebastian, and ready to launch a come-back. Sebastian is oblivious. Marla is bored. Their marriage has run aground on the rocky coastline of middle-aged suburban boredom. It's only when their little boy disappears, kidnapped by Tyler, that Sebastian is dragged back into the world of Mayhem.\\" Dark Horse Comics published this new story in a 10-issue maxi series, written by Palahniuk and illustrated by Cameron Stewart, starting in 2015. Artist David W. Mack, who is friends with Palahniuk, illustrated the covers for the series and has said of the material, \\"The twists and turns are just primo artifacts of Chuck Palahniuk's brain material.\\" A teaser was released by Dark Horse Comics for Free Comic Book Day 2015, with Fight Club 2 #1 following in late May of that year. The series explores Joseph Campbell's concept of the 'second father' as being vital to the hero's journey, which is something that has always fascinated Palahniuk. Orbital in Conversation Episode 150 On the Orbital In Conversation podcast, Chuck stated that he is already working on Fight Club 3, which will also be in comic form. He also confirmed that he is working on a series of original short stories for comics which will appear as one-shots before eventually being collected into a single book. Orbital Comics podcast with Chuck Palahniuk Fight Club 3 consists of twelve issues, with the first one being released on January 30, 2019.

He was born in Boston to William Cooper and Judith Sewall, attended the Boston Latin School, and was graduated from Harvard College in 1743. He was ordained as a minister on May 21, 1746, and served as pastor of the Brattle Street Church, 1747-1783. Members of his parish at the Brattle St. Church included some of the most influential people of the American Revolution: John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Joseph Warren, John Adams, and others. He corresponded with Benjamin Franklin, Charles Hector d'Estaing, Gideon Hawley, Charles Gravier de Vergennes;Huntington Library and was associated with Phillis Wheatley. In 1780, he co-founded the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served as \\"chaplain to the General Court\\" 1758-1770 and 1777-1783.

Paul Jones was foaled in the same year as Man o' War, winner of the 1920 Preakness and Belmont Stakes and one of the most influential sires of the 20th century. Man o' War was not entered in the 1920 Kentucky Derby because it was thought that a race so early in the season would be too taxing for him.Avalyn Hunter. American Classic Pedigrees: 1914-2002.

He was sired by the imported British stallion, Sea King, and was out of the Hamburg bred mare, May Florence.Paul Jones Pedigree He was named after famous Admiral John Paul Jones and a popular brand of whiskey at the time. Racing career The 1920 Kentucky Derby was run on an overcast day on a slow track with a field of seventeen horses. Ridden by Ted Rice he won the race by a nose after staving off Upset, who showed impressive speed on the home stretch, and close third On Watch. Paul Jones proved his Derby win was not a fluke by winning the 1920 Suburban Handicap. Paul Jones raced for a total of five years and, being a gelding with no career at stud, was given to his trainer, William Garth, for use as an exercise pony. Garth spoke favorably of his former charge, complimenting the gelding's gentle disposition and work ethic. Paul Jones did race in a few pony races at the Pimlico Race Course and was entered in a number of steeplechase races in the late 1920s under the name of Garth's son-in-law, Dr. John Paul Jones.The Washington Post. \\"Steeplechase seen by crowd of 20,000.\\" Nov 16, 1928. Dr. Jones also trained Paul Jones as a hunter and rode him in fox hunts. Retirement In 1929, Paul Jones was pensioned by Garth to live the remainder of his life at the Inglecress Farm near Charlottesville, Virginia, also the final home of 1911 Kentucky Derby winner Meridian. Paul Jones was euthanized in April 1930 due to physical infirmities and was buried at Dr. John Paul Jones's Inglecress Farm near Charlottesville, Virginia.Daily Racing Form \\"1920 Derby Winner Dead.\\" May 7, 1930.

History The abbey was initially constructed at the behest of the Norman invader William the Conqueror to commemorate his victory at the site over the Anglo-Saxon King of England, Harold Godwinson in 1066. Subsequently, the abbey was partially destroyed during the dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII. During this period some of the abbey buildings were destroyed. The 13th-century Abbot‚Äôs house was preserved and passed into private hands, and numerous additional structures also survived including the 14th-century gatehouse (which now serves as the main school gate) as well as a ruined monks' dorter (dormitory). The school was founded in 1912, as St. Etheldreda's, Bexhill, by May Jacoby and her sister Helen Sheehan-Dare. It moved into the Abbey in 1922, with an enrolment of 33 girls. Within a year there were 100 girls and the Board of Education officially recognised the school in 1926.

It provides basic functions like launching applications, switching between windows and is also a widget engine. GNOME Shell replaced GNOME Panel and some ancillary components of GNOME 2. GNOME Shell is written in C and JavaScript as a plugin for Mutter. In contrast to the KDE Plasma Workspaces, a software framework intended to facilitate the creation of multiple graphical shells for different devices, the GNOME Shell is intended to be used on desktop computers with large screens operated via keyboard and mouse, as well as portable computers with smaller screens operated via their keyboard, touchpad or touchscreen. History The first concepts for GNOME Shell were created during GNOME's User Experience Hackfest 2008 in Boston. After criticism of the traditional GNOME desktop and accusations of stagnation and lacking vision, the resulting discussion led to the announcement of GNOME 3.0 in April 2009. Since then Red Hat has been the main driver of GNOME Shell's development. Pre-release versions of GNOME Shell were first made available in August 2009 and became regular, non-default part of GNOME in version 2.28 in September 2009. It was finally shipped as GNOME's default user interface on April 6, 2011. Design As graphical shell (graphical front-end/graphical shell/UX/UI) of the GNOME desktop environment, its design is guided by the GNOME UX Design Team. =Design components= The GNOME Shell comprises the following graphical and functional elements: * Top bar * System status area * Activities Overview * Dash * Window picker * Application picker * Search * Notifications and messaging tray * Application switcher * Indicators tray (deprecated) Software architecture GNOME Shell is tightly integrated with Mutter, a compositing window manager and Wayland compositor. It is based upon Clutter to provide visual effects and hardware acceleration According to GNOME Shell maintainer Owen Taylor, it is set up as a Mutter plugin largely written in JavaScript and uses GUI widgets provided by GTK+ version 3. =Features= Changes to the user interface (UI) include, but are not limited to: * Clutter and Mutter support multi-touch gestures. * Support for HiDPI monitors. * A new Activities overview, which houses:  A dock (called \\"Dash\\") for quickly switching between and launching applications  A window picker, similar to macOS's Mission Control, also incorporating a workspace switcher/manager  An application picker  Search * \\"Snapping\\" windows to screen borders to make them fill up a half of the screen or the whole screen * A single window button by default, Close, instead of three (configurable). Minimization has been removed due to the lack of a panel to minimize to, in favor of workspace window management. Maximization can be accomplished using the afore-mentioned window snapping, or by double-clicking the window title bar. * A fallback mode is offered in versions 3.0‚Äì3.6 for those without hardware acceleration which offers the GNOME Panel desktop. This mode can also be toggled through the System Settings menu. GNOME 3.8 removed the fallback mode and replaced it with GNOME Shell extensions that offer a more traditional look and feel. =Extensibility= The functionality of GNOME Shell can be changed with extensions, which can be written in JavaScript. Users can find and install extensions using the GNOME extensions website. Some of these extensions are hosted in GNOME's git repository, though they are not official. =Gallery= File:GNOME_Shell.png  GNOME Shell Overlay Mode Windows File:GNOME Shell 3.32 overview screenshot.png  GNOME Shell Overlay Mode Applications File:GNOMEWindowedTerminalScreenshot.jpg  GNOME 3 Shell showing Terminal and Firefox applications Adoption * Arch Linux dropped support of GNOME 2 in favor of GNOME 3 in its repositories in April 2011. * Fedora uses GNOME Shell by default since release 15, May 2011. * Sabayon Linux uses the latest version of GNOME Shell. * openSUSE's GNOME edition has used GNOME Shell since version 12.1 in November 2011. * Mageia 2 and later include GNOME Shell, since May 2012. * Debian 8 and later features GNOME Shell in the default desktop, since April 2015. * Solaris 11.4 replaced GNOME 2 with GNOME Shell in August 2018. * Ubuntu uses GNOME Shell by default since 17.10, October 2017, after Canonical ceased development of Unity.http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/06/ubuntu-17-10-daily-builds-gnome It has been available for installation in the repositories since version 11.10. An alternative flavor, Ubuntu GNOME, was released alongside Ubuntu 12.10, and gained official flavor status by Ubuntu 13.04. =Reception= GNOME Shell has received mixed reviews: It has been criticized for a variety of reasons, mostly related to design decisions and reduced user control over the environment. For example, users in the free software community have raised concerns that the planned tight integration with Mutter will mean that users of GNOME Shell will not be able to switch to an alternative window manager without breaking their desktop. In particular, users might not be able to use Compiz with GNOME Shell while retaining access to the same types of features that older versions of GNOME allowed. Reviews have generally become more positive over time, with upcoming releases addressing many of the annoyances reported by users.

Europeans first settled there, at the headwaters of the East Fork of the Russian River, in 1852. History In 1958, Congress passed the first \\"Rancheria Act,\\" and 41 Rancherias in California were terminated. Throughout California, 7,601 acres of trust lands were terminated, and 1,330 Native people killed. The Potter Valley Rancheria was formally terminated on 1 August 1961. This revoked the Tribe's federal status, excluded members from further assistance as Indians, and distributed land assignments to eligible members. This placed the land in fee simple status, allowing members to live on or dispose of the property ? and be subject to property taxes for the first time in history. One 10 acre parcel purchased in 1892 continued to be occupied by Potter Valley Pomo Indians and their descendants. Properties of the original Rancheria were sold over the years; there are only one or two properties still belonging to the descendants of the Indians who lived there. The Rancheria is still erroneously shown on road maps. In 1979, tribes throughout northern California counties sued in the United States District Court. The lawsuit alleged that the federal government had illegally terminated 17 Indian tribes. This lawsuit, Tillie Hardwick, et al. v. United States, U.S. Dist. Court, Northern Dist. of California, No. C-79-1710-SW, has become noteworthy in northern California. The Potter Valley Tribe, and other California tribes, are often referred to as \\"Tillie Hardwick Tribes.\\" On 2 March 1993 the Potter Valley Rancheria adopted a constitution and by-laws, establishing a Tribal Council and assuming governmental functions. The Potter Valley Tribe presently has an on-reservation service population of 31 people.http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/article/zz/20120511/NEWS/120515674 Records The majority of records of individuals were those created by the agencies. Some records may be available to tribal members through the tribal headquarters. They were (and are) the local office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and were charged with maintaining records of the activities of those under their responsibility.

The Rancheria is situated in the western slope of Potter Valley. The Potter Valley Tribe is located at the address of 2251 South State Street Ukiah, CA 95482. In the early 20th century, the Rancheria was a village of 11 houses with 50 residents. They came from all villages all over the valley, including the Yukian Huchnom band.

She was a daughter of James Patton NewellRaymond, 64Jordan, 372 and Anna Cynthia Gray. As a child, Emily was an avid reader, and, from a remarkably young age, a talented writer. She was a plump, assertive child and thought that she was not especially popular with her classmates or teachers. To compensate, she excelled in her schoolwork and was the leader of her siblings at home.Laas, xii Her father, a native of Franklin, Venango County, Pennsylvania as a young man, made a fortune in lumber and oil. Unfortunately, he explored for more oil and lost the fortune.Laas, 3 He removed to Joplin, Missouri around 1874 with his lawyer's license. He was an investor in the local lead mine in Joplin. He also served as the County Clerk for Joplin. In 1883, he was elected as Jasper County Recorder of Deeds, and then he moved his family to Carthage, fifteen miles away from Joplin. He had also served in the 30th Iowa Volunteer Infantry as a lieutenant in the Civil War.

Emily wrote the following about her mother: \\"When she moved from Franklin, Venango County, Pennsylvania to the mining camps in Joplin, Missouri she brought her books and her silver-bound writing desk. She kept up her French reading, made out a study course, and practiced daily on the hotel piano. She did such things until her death. At sixty, she was taking an extension course from the University of Chicago, and she played the organ at church until her death. When she died at age seventy-two, her Spanish textbook was found open on the table.\\"Laas, 5 =Education= She was an 1894 graduate of Carthage Senior High School. She was educated at Goucher College and the University of Missouri. She returned to Carthage upon her father's death, before graduating, to help support and care for her brother and three sisters. =Marriage and family= She married on December 24, 1900 at Carthage, Jasper County, Missouri to Harry Wallace Blair, the son of John Blair and Mary Jane Plttenger.Laas, xxiii‚Äì91 He was born on July 7, 1877 at Maryville, Missouri and died at Alexandria, Arlington County, Virginia in 1964. He was a 1904 graduate of the George Washington University School of Law. While attending law school, he worked as a secretary for Secretary of Labor and Commerce George B. Cortelyou. During World War I, he served in France with the YMCA.Dowling, 279 After the war, he returned to the U.S. and from 1919 to 1933, he practiced law in Joplin, Missouri. He was an active member of the Oxford Group (known as Moral Re-Armament from 1938 until 2001, and as Initiatives of Change since then) founded by Dr. Frank N.D. Buchman. He was appointed in 1933 as an Assistant U.S. Attorney General overseeing the United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division under Attorney General Homer Cummings. After serving as Assistant U.S. Attorney General, he served as a special assistant to the Attorney General for several years, and then went into private practice in Washington, D.C. with his son, Newell Blair. From 1947 until 1950, Mr. Blair served on a Regional Loyalty Board, and from 1950‚Äì53 served on the President's Loyalty Review Board, which reviewed federal agency loyalty board determinations regarding whether federal workers were pro-Communist. He retired in 1962. They were the parents of two children. Their son Newell Blair attended Yale University and graduated from the University of the South in 1929. He received his law degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1932.Obituary: \\"Attorney, Publisher Newell Blair Dies\\" Washington Post. June 21, 2004. He was a Washington lawyer and businessman who was the founder of three legal newsletters. Their daughter, Harriet Blair was the wife of Newton Melville Forsythe.Jordan, 372 =Career= Blair became active in the local suffragist campaign. In 1914, she became publicity chair for the Missouri Equal Suffrage Association and the first editor of its monthly publication, Missouri Woman.The League of Women voters unveiled a bronze tablet in Washington, D.C. honoring suffrage pioneers during their annual council meeting in Washington, April 14‚Äì17, 1931. ENB's name was one of twenty-six Missouri women. (\\"Notes and Comments,\\" Missouri Historical Review [October 1930 ‚Äì July 1931]:649) After the United States' entry into World War I, Blair became vice chair of the Missouri Woman's Committee of the Council of Defense. When her husband went abroad for the YMCA, she accepted a position in the publicity department of the Women's Committee of the Council of National Defense, working for Ida M. TarbellLaas, xiv‚Äì185 and Anna Howard Shaw.Laas, xiv‚Äì168 In 1920, Blair published its history, \\"The Women's Committee, U.S. Council of National Defense: An Interpretive Report.‚Äù She had been a founder of the League of Women Voters, but realized that since gaining suffrage, women had lost political clout. Although they had the right to vote, they tended not to vote in blocks. Women must, Blair contended, organize and support strong women candidates for office who could lead the demand for equality. As a result, she organized more than 2,000 Democratic Women's Clubs around the country and built regional training programs for women party workers. She first served as secretary (1922‚Äì1926) and then later as president (1928‚Äì1929) of the Woman's National Democratic Club, and was the club's principal founder.McArthur, 118‚Äì119‚Äì124‚Äì125‚Äì126‚Äì127‚Äì128 She was the first woman to attain a prominent position in Democratic party politics, serving as the national vice chairwoman of the Democratic Party. She was first elected in 1922 and reelected in 1924 and served until 1928. During her tenure, she worked to elect women to public office. During her tenure as national vice chairwoman, she was continually seeking Democratic support in Congress for issues in which women were interested. The United States Children's Bureau created by President William Howard Taft in 1912, was of interest to all women and worked for support for it from Democrats.The Bureau advises the Administration on Children, Youth and Families, on matters related to child welfare, including child abuse and neglect, child protective services, family preservation and support, adoption, foster care, and independent living. She started meeting with then Congressman, later Speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn of Texas to gather support.Laas, 234 As a bachelor, she approached him with some trepidation but as they spoke he became greatly interested in the importance of The Children's Bureau and was very helpful with gathering Democratic support in Congress for the Bureau. Afterward, she went to him often for advice and assistance. Years later she recalled that she ran into him at a Washington, D.C. restaurant shortly after the Roosevelt administration came into power, he came across the room to her table and asked her what she wanted in the way of an appointment. When she told him nothing, that already she had had all she wanted from politics ‚Äì much fun and work and many fine friends, he replied: \\"Well, if you change your mind and I can help, let me know, for if anyone is entitled to the fruits of victory you are that one.\\"Laas, 234 They remained close friends until her death in 1951. She also served as a key player in Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1932 Presidential campaign. She helped secure the nomination for Roosevelt, and during the campaign she was one of four women sent by the DNC on speaking tours across the country. She was one of handful of women rewarded for her contributions to his election, though she was not seeking a major patronage position for herself. A prolific writer, she was the author of several books, many short stories, and innumerable articles on politics. She also served from 1925 to 1934 as an Editor of Good Housekeeping magazine. Blair was active in securing positions for women in the New Deal. Appointed to the Consumers' Advisory Board of the National Industrial Recovery Act, she became its chairwoman in 1935. Her last public service came in 1942 when she was appointed chief of the women's interest section of the War Department's Bureau of Public Relations. In the 1940s, the Washington Post regularly covered the Blairs' parties, which often included Washington's elite. In her autobiography, she remembered how she was described by Senator Carter Glass: \\"I was like the drink called Southern Comfort which goes down so smooth and easily but has an awful kick afterwards\\".Laas, 231 She retired from public life in 1944 after suffering a stroke. =Works= The Women's Committee, U.S. Council of National Defense: An Interpretive Report =Death= She died on August 3, 1951 in Alexandria, Arlington County, Virginia.

It was inspired by \\"That's How I Feel\\", a blues song by Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. Originally released in 1974, it was re-released in 1991 as one of the bonus tracks on the re-release of Queen II. It was described as \\"a slow crawl that's the closest Queen ever came to blues\\".  Details  The \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" single featured the first of several non-album B-sides released during Queen's recording career. This song dated from the pre-Queen band Smile. Brian May heard the song \\"That's How I Feel\\" by Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee on a TV program, but at the time he never caught the name of the song or band. He remembered the riff and some lyrics and brought them to the band, then proceeded to write \\"See What A Fool I've Been\\" around it. It was not recorded until the Queen II sessions, though it was a live staple since Queen's formation. The B-side version features a vocal delivery from Freddie Mercury that could be best described as burlesque in nature, rather than the more straightforward delivery of the live and BBC versions which were officially released in 2011. Also, there are lyric changes between the B-side, BBC and live versions (with references to a \\"train to Georgia\\" and a \\"Greyhound bus at dawn\\" not heard in B-side version, whereas the live versions have no \\"sailor boy\\" or \\"barking dog\\" lyrics). The reason for these differences has never been explained. In 2004, May was contacted by a fan who had discovered which song \\"See What A Fool I've Been\\" had been based on, as it had long been a mystery. May officially confirmed \\"That's How I Feel\\" as the inspiration after the fan sent him the recently released CD containing the song (along with a note explaining how it was tracked down by looking up song lyrics rather than listening to every recording by Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee). The explanation of the song's history appears on the February 2004 Soapbox entry of May's official website. May said he planned to contact their estates to work out the long-overdue royalty issues.

Legal counsel for the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company and other businesses, he was active in Democratic Party politics and in civic organizations. President of the Oregon Historical Society from 1908-1927, he was known for his biography of John McLoughlin. A great admirer of roses, Holman helped organize the Portland Rose Society and is credited with giving Portland one of its nicknames, \\"Rose City\\". A parcel of land once owned by Holman became Holman Park, which was later merged with other parks and parcels to form Portland's Forest Park in 1948. Ancestry and early life Holman's parents were James Duval Holman and Rachel Hixson (Summers) Holman, both originally from Kentucky. Holman's great-grandfather, Thomas Holman, emigrated from England to South Carolina in 1730. His grandfather, John Holman, born in Kentucky, fought in the War of 1812 and emigrated to Oregon in 1843. His father, James Duval Holman, one of the founders of Pacific City, moved to Portland in 1857. The J.D. Holman School in Portland was named in his honor. One of eight children, Frederick Van Voorhies Holman was born in Pacific County, Washington, in what was then part of the Oregon Territory. He attended public and private schools in Portland and graduated from the Portland Academy and Female Seminary in 1868. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, from which he graduated with a bachelor of philosophy (Ph.B) degree in 1875. After studying law, Holman was admitted in 1879 to the Oregon bar. Career The Frederick V. Holman House in Portland Holman, who never married, practiced in Portland, where he specialized in corporate, real property, and probate law and became general counsel for the Portland Railway, Light & Power Company, local general counsel for H. M. Byllesby & Company, and a director of the Oregon Power Company. In addition to his legal work, he was also a writer. Among his published works were the Biography of Dr. John McLoughlin, many articles for the quarterly of the Oregon Historical Society, and many articles on roses, including the pamphlet, \\"Roses at Portland, Oregon, and How to Grow Them\\". An organizer of the Portland Rose Society, he has been credited with giving Portland one of its nicknames, \\"Rose City\\". President of the Oregon Historical Society from 1908-1927, he was also president of the Oregon Bar Association in 1909-10, and a regent of the University of Oregon from 1903 to 1915. He was a member of the Portland Charter Commission and director of the John McLoughlin Memorial Association. (McLoughlin, chief factor of the Columbia District of the Hudson's Bay Company during the second quarter of the 19th century has sometimes been referred to as \\"The Father of Oregon\\"). His political affiliation was with the Democratic Party, and he served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1892 and 1904 and was an Oregon member of the Democratic National Committee from 1904 to 1908. His memberships and affiliations included the American Bar Association, the American Historical Association, the Washington Historical Society, the National Rose Society of Great Britain, the National Geographic Society, and the National Municipal League. In addition, he belonged to Portland organizations including the Arlington, University, Waverly Golf, and Portland Commercial clubs. Death and legacy Holman grave at Lone Fir Cemetery Holman died in 1927 in Portland. He is buried at Lone Fir Cemetery in southeast Portland. Lone Fir is one of several pioneer cemeteries managed by Metro, the regional government of the Oregon part of the Portland metropolitan area. Holman owned property in the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills) to the northwest of the city center. After the property was damaged by a flume operation in 1909, Holman offered it to the city for a park if it agreed to acquire the land necessary to connect his property to nearby Macleay Park. The transaction was not completed until 12 years after his death. In 1939 his siblings, George F. and Mary Holman, gave the land to the city, and in 1948, Holman Park and several other parks and parcels of land were combined to form Forest Park. The 1892 Frederick V. Holman House in Portland's Goose Hollow neighborhood was demolished in early October 2016. It was designed by Edgar M. Lazarus.

Glyn Leach helped to launch the magazine, serving as the editor from its first issue in April 1989 until his death in 2014. The title was launched alongside Boxing Weekly, which was seen as a direct competitor to Britain's other weekly boxing paper, Boxing News. Boxing Weekly proved unsuccessful and folded inside a year. The monthly magazine proved more popular, with a readership of approximately 25,000. International Boxing Hall of Fame inductee Graham Houston was its editor at the time it ceased publication, having taken over duties upon Leach's death.

Described in 2008, the genus contains two species, A. andreaeicola and A. grisea, that were collected from high elevations in the Scottish Highlands. The two species have also been found in single instances in British Columbia and Northern Norway. The generic name is derived from the Greek , meaning \\"neglected\\" or \\"overlooked\\"; it was originally intended to be Amelia, which is also the first name of the daughter of one of the authors, but this name had previously been used for another genus and was therefore ineligible for use according to the rules of mycological nomenclature. Ameliella appears to have some similarity with the lichen genus Miriquidica. Description In the genus Ameliella, the lichen thalli are small, grey-brown in color, and covered with warts or projections that resemble warts. The thalli form patches that are typically in diameter. There are usually copious apothecia (sexual reproductive structures) that cover much of the thallus. The spores are translucent (hyaline), ranging in shape from narrowly ellipsoid to spindle-shaped to oblong to ellipsoid. The spore dimensions are 10‚Äì24 by 5‚Äì7 Œºm; the surface structure is simple, without a thick outer coat (epispore), or ornamentation. Distribution Based on the collection sites of the two known species, Ameliella is restricted to locations near oceans. Other than the Scottish Highlands, A. andreaeicola is known only from single collections in British Columbia and Norway, while A. grisea has only been collected once in Norway. The Norway collection location (Skibotn area in eastern Troms County, central Northern Norway) is known for a rich lichen species diversity, considered unusual for such northern latitudes (68‚Äì69¬∞N).

It consisted of 204 persons (37 households), all Muslims. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33,3 % on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, fruit, beehives, vineyards and goats; a total of 10,400 ak√ße. 6,5/24 of the revenue went to a Waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 149.

Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p.115 =British Mandate period= In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Jules had a population of 481 Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table V, Sub-district of Gaza, p. 9 increasing in the 1931 census to 682, still all Muslims, in 165 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 4. The village was laid out in a square, sandwiched between the two highways and bounded at one end by the traffic circle where they intersected. Its adobe and cement houses were constructed close together. The village had a mosque, and a shrine dedicated to Shaykh Khayr. According to local tradition, Khayr was a Muslim soldier killed fighting against the Crusaders. Village shops were scattered along the highway and in 1937 a school was opened; it had an enrollment of 86 students in the mid-1940s. Underground water was abundant in Julis and was used for domestic methods. Julis 1930 1:20,000 Julis 1945 1:250,000 (botton centre) During World War II, the British authorities built a highway that passed through Julis parallel and feeding traffic to the coastal highway. The road also intersected at the village with the highway leading from al-Majdal (Ashkelon) to the Jerusalem‚ÄìJaffa highway. This gave the village importance as a transportation center. The British also constructed a military camp in Julis to control the junction. In the 1945 statistics Julis had a population of 1,030 Muslims, with a total of 13,584 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 137 =1948 War and aftermath= On May 27‚Äì28, 1948, the Givati Brigade's First Battalion captured a military barracks in Julis during Operation Barak, but failed to gain control of the village itself. Egyptian forces attempted to recapture it almost immediately. According to the History of the Haganah, \\"The defenders of the place [Givati forces] blocked enemy units which tried... to infiltrate the barracks from the direction of the village of Julis.\\" The Haganah account says that Julis was captured on June 11, as the Givati's Third Battalion mounted a number of operations to occupy a number of villages before the first truce of the war took place. However, in Gamal Abdel Nasser's memoirs, he recalled the maneuvers having taken place soon after the truce came into effect. At the end of the truce, Julis became one of the many main positions the Egyptians failed to recapture. The Egyptian Army's Sixth Battalion which Nasser was chief of staff of, was ordered to take back the position. In later years, Nasser was very critical of the operation's planning, writing \\"Once again we were a facing a battle for which we had no preparation. We had no information about the enemy at Julis.\\" In the few hours before his unit was to move towards Julis, Nasser organized a quick reconnaissance of the position. During the course of the battle, his commanding officer ordered him to participate in the actual fighting, leaving his unit without direction or coordination. After getting hold of a few aerial photographs of the village, Nasser convinced his commander that \\"even if we had succeeded in entering Julis... it would have turned into a cemetery for our forces.\\" He argued that Julis was indefensible without the barracks which overlooked it. On July 10, after many Egyptian casualties, the battle was called off. According to the Haganah, the Givati units repulsed an Egyptian attack in which no Israeli soldier was injured. A close colleague of Nasser, Isma'il Mohieddin was killed during the battle. Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and the moshav of Hodaya was established on village lands southwest of the village site in 1949. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, \\"Only a few houses remain. Most of them are made of cement, and have simple architectural features: flat roofs and rectangular doors and windows. One has two storeys and another has an 'illiyya. (A guest room on the top floor.) One house, in the southwestern section of the site, is occupied by Jewish residents.\\" References Bibliography       *Nasser, G.A.

Biography =Studies= Timofeyev comes from a musical family, being the son of cellist Natalia Timofeyeva. He began his study of the classical guitar in the early 1980s under the tutelage of Kamill Frauchi, about whom he later produced a documentary film, Frautschi . He holds an M.A. in Early Music Performance from the University of Southern California (1993), and a Ph.D. in Performance Practice from Duke University (1999) . Since 1983 he has been performing early music on authentic instruments of the plucked family (lute, guitar). In 1989 his musical interests brought him to the U.S., where he studied with Patrick O'Brien, James Tyler, and Hopkinson Smith. =Professional work= Revival of the Russian seven-string guitar Since earning his doctorate he has worked for the revival of Russian music played with authentic technique on the seven-string guitar, often in collaboration with other artists, including the Russian Roma guitarist Sasha Kolpakov, the Kolpakov Trio (Timofeyev, Kolpakov Trio and Talisman 2005), and the American guitarist John Schneiderman (Timofeyev and Schneiderman 2006). Among the fruits of his research has been his rediscovery and recording the music of Matvej Pavlov-Azancheev (1888‚Äì1963), who was among the rare composers for the seven-string guitar in the first half of the twentieth century. Timofeyev has performed and taught widely in Europe and the United States.

History of the Museum Part of the front facade of the Museo de la Historia de Ponce at Calle Mayor and Calle Isabel streets The idea of creating a Ponce history museum dates back to the 1930s, following a citizens group's initiative, but the project did not materialize then. Interest in the proposal revived years later under Ponce's Secretariat of Culture. The plan visualized a museum to be constructed on the block bordered by Isabel, Mayor, Cristina, and Salud streets, and Casa Salazar and Casa Zapater, two historic homes, were acquired, as was the empty lot where Casa Shuck Gelp√≠ had once stood. However, the project came to a standstill once again. The plan was revived once again, but with modifications, at the end of the 1980s. This time the project came under the direction of Ms. Maruja Candal Salazar and Dr. Neysa Rodr√≠guez Deynes (curator and founder). They worked in conjunction with a team of curators that included Lizette Cabrera Salcedo, Dr. Jos√© Molinelli, Alberto del Toro, and J. A. Figueroa Irizarry, as well as museum specialists An√≠bal Sep√∫lveda, N√©stor Barretto, and Jorge Carbonell, members of the Carimar Research Center. The four-year period from 1989 to 1992 saw the restoration of the Salazar and Zapater houses to serve as home to the Museum, and the completion of the research, planning, and design of its first four permanent exhibit halls of the museum, namely, ecology, panorama, economic activity, and architecture.Universidad Interamericana In 1994, the second phase of the project was initiated, under the direction of Lizette Cabrera Salcedo: the creation of two permanent exhibits, one focused on health and one entitled \\"Ponce in Puerto Rican Political Life\\", in addition to a multimedia presentation \\"Ponce is Ponce.\\" In 1998, the Ernesto Ramos Antonini auditorium, designed by architect Jos√© Berm√∫dez, was inaugurated under the direction of Lizette Cabrera Salcedo, at the location of the old Shuck Gelp√≠ House. Currently By 2002, ten years after its founding, the Museum of the History of Ponce had become one of Puerto Rico's most active cultural centers,Inter de Ponce and Puerto Rico's most complete history museum.Universia Puerto Rico The museum provides a variety of cultural offerings intended to strengthen and increase awareness of the study of Puerto Rican and Ponce√±o history. As part of the 10th anniversary celebrations, the third and last phase of the museum's development was begun. It included two permanent exhibits on education and daily life, and the creation of a general museum catalog. Building The main building that houses the museum has stained-glass windows, mosaics, and interior patios. Both buildings where the museum is housed are turn-of- the-20th-century homes. The Salazar House dates from 1911 and was designed by Blas Silva Boucher in an eclectic neoclassical style. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Zapater home, on the other hand, represents the criollo townhouse typology. It was built in 1880 and rebuilt in 1925. The Zapater residence was home to some of Ponce's most notable families, including the Clausells, Dapena, Zapater, and Rosaly families. It was also designed by Blas Silva.Brochure titled Tourist Attractions: Enjoy Ponce, Southern Experience. Office of Tourism Development. Autonomous Municipality of Ponce. Ponce, Puerto Rico. March 2011. Contents The museum consists of 10 exhibition halls. It showcases facts, documents, objects, and relics of Ponce's history, demonstrating the importance of the city in the development of the history of Puerto Rico, including its intellectual, political, social, cultural, and economic aspects. It also covers the role of the city in the artistic development of Puerto Rican culture in the areas of music, theater, opera, literature, and journalism. Included in the exhibits are depictions of the ethnic cultures that influenced southern Puerto Rico culture, such as Spanish, African and non-European immigrants. The permanent exhibits of the museum =Ecology= The first exhibition hall depicts the land and climate of the municipality: its coast, plains, and mountains. It shows how the city's natural surroundings are the departure point for learning about its history. It includes a scale model of the municipality, with illustrations of its fertile soils, natural resources, and native fauna. The curator in charge of this exhibit was Dr. Jos√© Mollinelli, with sponsorship by CARIMAR. =Panorama= Human beings make an entrance in this exhibit describing how humans interact with their environment. The Panorama hall presents the origins of the settlement at Ponce and the evolution of its population from pre- Hispanic times through the beginnings of the 20th century. It includes the regions and countries from which the present inhabitants originated, emphasizing Ponce's heterogeneous populace.

The second room explains the creation of the Estado Libre Asociado, and the life and work of governors native to Ponce: Luis A. Ferr√© and Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n, as well as Roberto S√°nchez Vilella, who claimed Ponce as his adoptive city. Among the most significant pieces in this exhibition hall is the Prince of Asturias of Literature Prize (Premio Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias de las Letras), a small bronze statue created by the famous Spanish sculptor Juan Mir√≥. =Finance and Economics= One of the most significant themes in the Museum, economic development, is the largest factor in the city's growth from its founding through the present day. The development of the port, agriculture, industry, and banking has supported Ponce's economic development, which in turn has significantly nourished its cultural, social, and intellectual development are evident in this exhibition hall. The curator in charge of this exhibit was Lizette Cabrera Salcedo, with sponsorship by CARIMAR. =Architecture and Urban Development= The evolution of Ponce's urban landscape is illustrated in successive periods of development. The exhibit presents the city's architects and highlights typical elements of Ponce's native architecture. It includes domestic, military, and institutional architecture, public works and the evolution of open space that define this city as a traditional urban center of importance. The hall includes a scale model of the city's urban development, and a photographic montage including plans, buildings, architects, and art installations. The curator in charge of this exhibit was Architect Alberto del Toro, with sponsorship by CARIMAR. =Health and Medicine= This exhibit shows the creation and evolution of Ponce's principal health institutions from 1863 until the present day and the medical community from the early 20th century until the 1940s.

His academic background was that of a theoretical physicist. He was also a member of the 8th legislature of the Sejm, of which was also the Senior Marshal from 12 November 2015 till his death. His son Mateusz Morawiecki is the Prime Minister of Poland and a former chairman of Bank Zachodni WBK. Life and career Morawiecki was born in Warsaw, Poland, the son of Micha≈Ç and Jadwiga (n√©e Szuma≈Ñska). He graduated from the gimnazjum of Adam Mickiewicz in 1958 in Warsaw. He finished a higher degree in physics at the University of Wroc≈Çaw in 1963. He completed his doctorate under Jan Rzewuski in Quantum Field Theory in 1970. He worked as a researcher at the University of Wroc≈Çaw, at first in the Institute of Physics, and later in Mathematics. After 1973, he worked at the Wroc≈Çaw Polytechnic. In 1968 he took part in student strikes and demonstrations.Government of the Czech Government, \\"August 21, 2008: Premier Awarded Commemorative Medals to Ten Dissidents from 1968\\", 21. 8. 2008, After the repression of the student protests, together with a group of close friends he edited, printed, and distributed pamphlets which denounced the Communist government for their repressions against the protesting students.

He was a delegate to the First National Congress of NSZZ Solidarity. At the end of May 1982, together with Pawe≈Ç Falicki, he founded the \\"Organization of Fighting Solidarity\\" which was a unique political opposition organization in Poland and the countries of the Soviet Bloc. It was the only group which from the beginning of its existence called for an end to communism in PolandJPRS Report, East Europe, June 4, 1990, pgs. 18-21 and other Soviet satellites, the establishment of sovereign governments independent from Moscow therein, the breakup of the Soviet Union and separation of the USSR republics into new nation states, and the reunification of Germany within its Potsdam-imposed borders. While eventually all these things did in fact come to pass, at the time this program was seen as quite radical and unrealistic, even in dissident circles. However, Fighting Solidarity also rejected the use of violence to achieve its aims. After the declaration of martial law in Poland in 1981, Morawiecki became one of the most wanted people in Poland.Artur Adamski, \\"Czas wielkiej pr√≥by\\" (The Time of Great Trial), Encyclopedia Solidarnosci (Encyclopedia of Solidarity) and Gazeta Polska, June 4, 2008, In 1984, on the directive of General Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak, a special team was created in the Ministry of Internal Affairs charged with observing several dozen locations in which the authorities thought he could show up. On 9 November 1987, after six years of conspiratorial activity in the underground, he was caught and arrested by the S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa (Secret Police) in Wroc≈Çaw and was immediately transported by helicopter to Warsaw, and imprisoned in Rakowiecka Prison. Despite his capture, none of his associates, nor those who hid him during the past six years, nor the archives of the organization were captured. At the end of April, 1988 he was given the opportunity to travel to Rome for much needed medical treatment by the communist authorities (who at the time were trying to get rid of \\"difficult\\" people), while his right of return to Poland was guaranteed through mediation by the Catholic Church. Three days later, he attempted to return to Poland but his passport was confiscated and he was deported from the airport in Warsaw to Vienna.Sabrina P. Ramet, \\"Social currents in Eastern Europe\\", Duke University Press, 1995, pg. 98 and 190, , He managed to illegally re-enter Poland in September 1988, by pretending to be a Canadian human rights delegate. After the fall of communism in Poland, Morawiecki registered his candidacy for the post of President of Poland in 1990, but in the end was unable to collect the required 100,000 signatures.Dominik Gajda, \\"Poland After the Round Table - The History of the Independent Poland 1989-2007\\", pg. 4, During his televised election campaign he symbolically turned over a round table, a reference to the Polish Round Table Agreement which, he felt, compromised too much with the communists.Kornel Morawiecki, \\"Dlaczego przewr√≥ci≈Çem okrƒÖg≈Çy stolik\\" (Why did I overturn a round table?), Rzeczpospolita, 05-02-2009, For his activism in support of an independent Poland, the Polish Government in Exile under president Kazimierz Sabbat awarded him the Officer's Cross of Polonia Restituta (Order of Poland Reborn). In June 2007, on the 25th anniversary of Fighting Solidarity, he refused to accept the Grand Cross of Polonia Restituta from the President of Poland, arguing that the organization he represented deserved the highest possible state honour - the Order of the White Eagle.Bart≈Çomiej Radziejowski, \\"Czech√≥w powinna przepraszaƒá Moskwa\\" (Moscow Should Apologize to the Czechs), Rzeczpospolita, 2008-08-23, accessed at He was also awarded the Karel Kram√°≈ô Medal by the Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topol√°nek, for his opposition to the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. He was one of the candidates in the 2010 Polish presidential election, but received only 0.13% of the vote and did not make it into the second round. In the 2015 Sejm election, he was first-place candidate on the Kukiz'15 electoral list of Pawe≈Ç Kukiz in the Wroc≈Çaw electoral district. He was involved in a Sejm scandal in April 2016, when Morawiecki left his Sejm member card in the voting device after feeling ill and exiting the debating hall, resulting in MP Ma≈Çgorzata Zwiercan casting his vote for him. The political party Civic Platform notified the National Public Prosecutor's Office of this event. Following the scandal, he left Kukiz'15 and began organizing his own party along with Ma≈Çgorzata Zwiercan, who had been expelled from the Parliamentary club. Apart from his work as a politician, he also worked at the Mathematics Institute of the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology. Personal life In 1959 he married Jadwiga with whom he has four children including Mateusz Morawiecki, the Prime Minister of Poland. After his divorce from Jadwiga, he married Anna with whom he had a son. He died in 2019 from pancreatic cancer.

The club‚Äôs name was chosen by the owner, Winston E. Willis, to symbolize a devout gathering place dedicated to the icons of the jazz world where these artists would be collectively enjoyed and appreciated. During its brief history, with frequent headlining appearances by jazz greats such as Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Dizzy Gillespie, and Cannonball Adderley among others, the popular nightspot was more successful than any other similar venue in the region.  History  Opened in 1962, the Jazz Temple was the unique vision and creation of 19-year-old Winston E. Willis, an African-American entrepreneur who was also a devoted jazz enthusiast. A native of Montgomery, Alabama, Winston‚Äôs parents had joined in the Great Migration in 1954 and moved with their five children to Detroit. A couple of years later, Winston had dropped out of high school in the 10th grade and began establishing his own businesses. First, a neighborhood advertising newspaper called the West Side Shopping News, then, having learned the floor covering business at his father‚Äôs side, he secured a position as the manager of a tile store. It was in this position that led him to an unexpected encounter with jazz legend Miles Davis aka: \\"The Prince of Darkness\\". Going out on a call to answer a customer‚Äôs complaint about an unsatisfactory tile flooring job, Winston entered the large brick English Tudor Revival style home and came face to face with the iconic trumpeter, one of his favorite performers. Within a short time, while he supervised the workmen, Winston and Davis had numerous conversations about the jazz genre, with Winston sharing his dream of opening a jazz club someday. Although Davis was initially skeptical, he gradually realized that Winston was serious. So he made Winston a promise that if he was successful in opening his jazz club, he would come. And that was a promise kept, as Miles Davis made several appearances at the Temple. Having operated several successful small businesses in nearby areas, he sensed that something was lacking in this upscale college community. After making a careful assessment and determining what was needed and what would be likely to work, he decided that \\"high-quality jazz performances at a student- friendly and affordable price\\" was the answer. Then, quickly putting his idea into action, he secured a lease on a vacated building, a former Packard automobile showroom, and immediately began remodeling, with careful attention devoted to acoustics. During the remodeling of the building and the planning for the grand opening, a nationwide newspaper strike curtailed all print advertising possibilities. So, with his original plans interrupted, Winston purchased and refurbished a used UPS truck and turned the vehicle into a traveling billboard. His friend, local artist, Nelson Stevens, painted large, colorful ‚Äúcoming attraction‚Äù signs heralding the Jazz Temple‚Äôs approaching presence in the University Circle community. Shortly thereafter, the Jazz Temple opened to immediate and sensational success. The liquor-less establishment that seated approximately 450 people was situated on a triangular lot, then known as the Mayfield Triangle, on the corner of Euclid Avenue and Mayfield Road,https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/811 near the ethnic enclave known as Murray Hill-Little Italy and adjacent to Western Reserve University. With surrounding institutional neighbors such as the Cleveland Museum of Art, Severance Hall (home of the Cleveland Orchestra) and University Hospitals in the city‚Äôs so-called \\"cultural oasis\\", the Jazz Temple was a noteworthy, if incongruous success. With the support and assistance of his girlfriend, Charlene Hurd, the club offered casual dining, \\"the best burgers in town, using only freshly ground prime beef, the finest gourmet coffee available, and live jazz every night.\\" It has been described as \\"the ultimate 'beatnik' club\\". The owner booked world-famous artists from the world of jazz, and up-and-coming comics. Frequently, word-of-mouth brought visits from other well-known public figures, as when Malcolm X was welcomed and seated one evening. On another occasion, Martin Luther King Jr. was among the members of the large crowd attending a Dizzy Gillespie performance. During that time, the student body of Western Reserve University was predominately white, and these students and others from surrounding universities accounted for 80% of the club‚Äôs clientele. But as is typical of jazz establishments, there was a noticeable amount of race mixing and many interracial couples in attendance each night. Individuals who managed to navigate the social inequities of the time and gather in a communal appreciation of jazz. During this period of time, local restaurants in the University Circle and Murray Hill-Little Italy area refused to admit or serve African Americans in their establishments, which came as a great surprise to numerous jazz legends who performed at the Temple. Most of them were from the East coast and unaccustomed to encountering such affrontery so distant from the Deep South. On one occasion, after several members of his band had been turned away from an Italian restaurant directly across the street from the Temple, Dizzy Gillespie, having taken significant umbrage, immediately took off in a huff, charging across the street to demand an explanation. ‚ÄúWell, they‚Äôre gonna have to tell me to my face!‚Äù, he demanded. And moments later the restaurant owner succinctly obliged him. Soon after that encounter, Winston and Charlene began hosting the performers in their home for their meals. Charlene was an excellent cook and the large English Tudor home on East Boulevard became the desired location for many jazz legends to enjoy a hot meal, warm hospitality, and stimulating conversation. As the club‚Äôs notoriety grew throughout the county and state, it came to be known by many world-famous jazz musicians as \\"The Jazz Mecca\\". But the interracial dating and race-mixing triggered widespread resentment in the racially polarized community. Soon the attempted intimidation by law enforcement began. Some nights saw as many Cleveland police officers in attendance as regular customers. These visits were routinely followed by unscheduled and unannounced inspections and citations. Thereafter, months of ominous threats of violence and anonymous phone calls during and after business hours foretold of the coming end. Several famous acts appearing at the club refused to be intimidated initially, insisting on performing. The threats and other over acts of intimidation continued, e.g., numerous occasions in which ‚Äúwarning‚Äù sticks of dynamite were strategically placed around the perimeters of the building with notes.

It was published in 2009 by Random House Delacorte Press in the United States, and by Hachette Gollancz in Australia and the United Kingdom. This is the first volume of a trilogy; the second book in the series, The Dead-Tossed Waves, was released on March 9, 2010 and The Dark and Hollow Places followed in March 2011. As the story opens, an unexplained disaster has turned much of the human race into mindless, cannibalistic undead. They roam the forest of the title, seeking to destroy a band of survivors barricaded inside a walled village deep in the woods. However, the fence that protects these villagers also imprisons them within a dystopian society marked by violence, secrecy, and repression. The forest thus profoundly influences all the action of the novel. Plot summary Mary lives in a town ruled by the Sisterhood and the Guardians. The village is surrounded by fences; beyond lies only forest. There are only three ways through the fence: gates that open on paths that are themselves enclosed by fencing, expelling those who've been infected. Where the two paths lead, no one knows, for the Sisterhood says the village is the only human habitation left on Earth. Mary has been raised on stories passed down from her great-great-great-grandmother about life before the coming of zombies. She is especially fascinated by the ocean and believes if she could reach it, she would be free. Her adventure starts when there is a breaching in the fence. Mary must escape, find true love, and friendship while figuring out the mystery behind the other gates and fences. After a sad, hectic, twisted turn of events she finds the ocean, but it isn't at all what she expected. Critical reception The Forest of Hands and Teeth debuted in the US to critical acclaim, receiving starred reviews from School Library Journal and Publishers Weekly, which described the book as \\"fresh and riveting.\\" MTV called it \\"a pretty freakin' amazing, empowering and absolutely thrilling young-adult post-apocalyptic zombie love story.\\" Author and critic Bidisha selected The Forest of Hands and Teeth as one of the best books of the year for The Observer and Jo Fletcher picked it as one of the most notable books of the year at the World Fantasy Convention. =Accolades= Paperback cover of The Forest of Hands and Teeth * A New York Times best-seller * A Junior Library Guild selection * #4 on the IndieBound Kids' Indie Next List for Spring 2009 * A Borders Original Voices selection for April 2009 and Borders Original Voices finalist * Selected as an American Library Association \\"Best Book for Young Adults\\" * Selected for the Texas Library Association TAYSHAS High School Reading list (2010‚Äì2011) * Selected by librarians at the Denver Public Library as one of the Best Teen Books of 2009 * Nominated for the North Carolina School Library Media Association Young Adult Book Award * Nominated for the 2010-2011 Georgia Peach Book Award Characters ; Mary : The narrator, a teenager who wishes to learn what lies beyond the village.

Chabrill√≥n was born in Paran√°, Entre R√≠os, and later lived in Buenos Aires. He travelled widely across Europe and the Americas. In 1911 he published his first book of poems, entitled \\"A la luz de una sombra\\" (\\"Under a shadow's light\\"). He is considered one of the advanced poets of the creationism movement that was initiated with Vicente Huidobro and Pierre Reverdy. He handled the historical, the specific, the picturesque, the artificial, and sometimes he took for himself some elements of symbolism, of the Parnaso and those of decadentism (basic components of his revolutionary formula). As Mastronardi would do in the next movement, Chabrill√≥n pioneered the modernist \\"Kermesse porte√±a\\" in a very \\"entrerrianian\\" way. He belonged to the group of Bohemians who would meet at the Caf√© de los Inmortales in Buenos Aires. Evaristo Carriego, Ghiraldo, √Ålvaro Meli√°n Lafinur, Enrique Banchs, Juan Pedro Calou, Roberto F.

As of November 2005, only 58 people had directed human spaceflight missions. The Flight Director class of 2005, of which Alibaruho is a member, is the second largest ever appointed and the most diverse. The nine-member group also included three women and two Hispanics. Leading a team of flight controllers, support personnel and engineering experts, a flight director has the overall responsibility to manage and carry out Space Shuttle flights and International Space Station expeditions. A flight director also leads and orchestrates planning and integration activities with flight controllers, payload customers, space station partners and others. Background Alibaruho was born to the late Dr. George Alibaruho of Uganda, and Dr. Gloria Alibaruho of Macon, Georgia. His mother is a retired university professor of social sciences, and his father is a retired economist. From his early beginnings, Alibaruho's parents encouraged his interest in mathematics and science by exposing him to printed material about rockets and about NASA as well as by exposing him to science fiction media of the time. Kwatsi is married to Macresia Alibaruho with two children. \\"I caught the science bug very early from watching science fiction programs, and I wanted to learn about real science,\\" Alibaruho has said. Every chance he had, he signed up for extracurricular activities and seminars where he dedicated weekends and summers to further his knowledge of science and engineering. Education Alibaruho earned a Bachelor of Science in Avionics in 1994 from the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In May 2011, he earned a Master of Business Administration from Rice University through Rice's Executive MBA Program, which he attended full-time while concurrently performing his duties as Flight Director. Early NASA career Alibaruho started with NASA in 1993 as a Cooperative Education student serving in the Mission Operations Directorate's ISS Life Support Systems Group. Post-graduation, he serviced as an ISS Life Support Systems Flight Controller (MCC Call Sign: ECLSS) from 1995‚Äì2000. During that time, Alibaruho became one of the first ECLSS officers qualified for duty in the new International Space Station Program and served on missions ISS-1A/R, STS-88/ISS-2A, STS-101/ISS-2A.2a, STS-106/ISS-2A.2b, STS-97/ISS-4A, STS-105/ISS-5A.1. In May 2001, Alibaruho was selected as the Manager of the ISS Life Support Systems Group where he managed and trained a team of approximately 25 Flight Controllers. He served in this capacity for just over three years until he was selected as a Flight Director in February 2005. Flight Director career By August 2005, Alibaruho had completed more than 700 hours of training as an International Space Station Flight Director and reported for active duty in Mission Control immediately following completion of NASA's \\"Return-to-flight\\" mission, STS-114 / LF-1, a flight led by his longtime mentors Paul Hill and Mark Ferring. Shortly after, Alibaruho completed training as a Space Shuttle Flight Director, now qualified to manage operations on both spacecraft. During his Flight Director career, Alibaruho served as an Orbit ISS Flight Director for Assembly Missions STS-115 / ISS-12A and STS-123/ISS-1J/A. He served as an Orbit ISS Flight Director for Expeditions 11 ‚Äì 28, logging literally hundreds of shifts in Mission Control. Alibaruho served as a Shuttle Orbit Flight Director for Missions STS-126 / ULF-2, STS-127 / ISS-2J/A, STS-128 / ISS-17A, and STS-134 / ULF-6. During his tenure, Alibaruho served as the Lead ISS Flight Director for Russian EVA 15 and for STS-119 / ISS-15A, the mission which delivered the S6 Solar Array & Truss Segment to the International Space Station. As a Space Shuttle Flight Director, Alibaruho also served as the Lead Flight Director for Mission STS-130 / ISS-20A, the mission that delivered the Node-3 and Cupola to the International Space Station. After STS-130, Alibaruho was selected to serve a 7-month temporary assignment as Deputy Chief of the EVA, Robotics, and Crew Systems Operations Division, where he assisted the Division Chief in management of approximately 200 civil service and contractor personnel and the Division‚Äôs two major facilities, the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) and the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility (SVMF). As his temporary assignment as Deputy Division Chief concluded, NASA directed the addition of one final Space Shuttle Flight to the Program Manifest, STS-135 / ULF-7, which was to be the last Shuttle Flight in U.S. history. Senior Management of Mission Operations Directorate selected Alibaruho to serve as the Lead Space Shuttle Flight Director for this historic mission alongside Lead ISS Flight Director, J. Chris Edelen.

On the contrary the eigenmodes of a classically chaotic system (e.g. the stadium-shaped cavity on the right) tend to become gradually more uniform with increasing mode number. In quantum chaos, a branch of mathematical physics, quantum ergodicity is a property of the quantization of classical mechanical systems that are chaotic in the sense of exponential sensitivity to initial conditions. Quantum ergodicity states, roughly, that in the high-energy limit, the probability distributions associated to energy eigenstates of a quantized ergodic Hamiltonian tend to a uniform distribution in the classical phase space. This is consistent with the intuition that the flows of ergodic systems are equidistributed in phase space. By contrast, classical completely integrable systems generally have periodic orbits in phase space, and this is exhibited in a variety of ways in the high-energy limit of the eigenstates: typically that some form of concentration or \\"scarring\\" occurs in the limit. The model case of a Hamiltonian is the geodesic Hamiltonian on the cotangent bundle of a compact Riemannian manifold. The quantization of the geodesic flow is given by the fundamental solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation :U_t=\\\\exp(it\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta}) where \\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta} is the square root of the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator. The quantum ergodicity theorem of Shnirelman 1974, Yves Colin de Verdi√®re, and Zelditch states that a compact Riemannian manifold whose unit tangent bundle is ergodic under the geodesic flow is also ergodic in the sense that the probability density associated to the nth eigenfunction of the Laplacian tends weakly to the uniform distribution on the unit cotangent bundle as n -> ‚àû in a subset of the natural numbers of natural density equal to one. Quantum ergodicity can be formulated as a non- commutative analogue of the classical ergodicity (T. Sunada).

A sinkhole, formed where gypsum soil was eroded, leaving a steep-sided pit about deep and in diameter. Native American hunters could stampede bison in the direction of the pit, which was deep enough to kill or disable the animals that were driven into it. The location is one of a number of buffalo jump sites in the north central United States and southern Canada. The Vore site was used as a kill site and butchering site from about 1500 AD to about 1800 AD. Archeological investigations in the 1970s uncovered bones and projectile points to a depth of . About ten tons of bones were removed from the site. About five percent of the site has been excavated, and the pit is estimated to contain the remains of 20,000 buffalo. Bison bones in an excavation in the bottom of the buffalo jump.Lithic evidence suggests that the Kiowa and Apache used the site as they migrated southwards to their modern home in the Texas- New Mexico region. Later peoples using the Vore site included the Shoshone, Hidatsa, Crow and Cheyenne. The site was discovered during the construction of Interstate 90 in the early 1970s. Located on the Vore family ranch, the site was to be crossed by the Interstate. Exploratory drilling in the sinkhole yielded quantities of bison bones. The University of Wyoming was notified of the potential archeological site and the road was moved to the south. The site was investigated in 1971 and 1972 by Dr, George Frison of the University of Wyoming. In 1982 the site was transferred to the University by the Vore family with the stipulation that it be developed as a public education center within twelve years. Funding limitations prevented development, so the site was again transferred to the Vore Buffalo Jump Foundation, which has built a small interpretive center and provides interpretive services. The Vore site is located in a narrow strip of land between I-90 and old US 14. The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

It lasted four seasons and was hosted by Cris Morena. The program was based on the US show Double Dare. It aired during four extremely successful seasons, being the leader on its time-slot and spawning sold-out concerts, platinum-selling albums and licensed products. Cris presented the show with a group of ten teenagers which changed twice: one group during 1991 and 1992 and another one from 1993 to 1994. After four seasons, Cris decided to move on to other projects and to do a weekly variety show Jugate con Todo, which lasted four months and was not as successful. In 1994, Cris, alongside teenagers of the first two seasons, starred in soap opera Quereme. Michel Brown, Luciano Castro, Romina Yan among others debuted on television in Jugate Conmigo. Format Jugate Conmigo was based on the 1988 show Double Dare from Nickelodeon. It was hosted by Cris Morena alongside a group of ten attractive teenagers, five of each sex. The program was presented in front of an audience of about 700 preteens and teens and the audience and the hosts would participate in different games with big prizes. Those games were the center of the show (Jugate Conmigo is literally an expression that translate as Come Play with Me but it also means Give me your best). The show also relied heavily on music. Besides musical guests (including Duran Duran, Bon Jovi, Attaque 77, Alejandro Sanz among others), the cast itself sung songs about teen issues like gossip, sex, romantic relationship, kisses, jealously, etc. Those songs were compiled in albums that were released annually and were huge hits. All songs were written by Cris herself alongside her songwriting partner Carlos Nilson. The show also had sketches and, in 1993, telenovelas were added to the show. Those telenovelas lasted for about one week, had 15 minutes and starred the group of teenagers that hosted the show alongside Cris. In 1994, instead of weekly telenovelas of 15 minutes, Life College, a 30-minute telenovela about life in an elite boarding school, was aired inside the show during the entire year. The members from the staff were: 1990/1991: Romina Yan, Octavio Borro, Gaspar Teverovsky, Andy, Eric, Hern√°n Caire, Pamela Rodriguez, Carla, Carolina, Agustina, Mariana, Giselle, Mar√≠a Susini, Moira Gough, Coraje Avalos and Sebastian. In 1992/1993: Luciano Castro, Michel Brown, Nano, Chino Fernandez, Mariano, Trinidad Alcorta, Felicitas, Manuela, Ana Korn and Micaela. Success The show was a gigantic hit, becoming a phenomenon among the young public. It was the leader in its time-slot during all four seasons and caused hysteria in live concerts and signings across the country. The cast did one nationwide tour, a series of concerts in Estadio Obras in Buenos Aires in 1992 and over 50 live presentations in Teatro Gran Rex in 1994. The albums sung by the cast of the show were released annually and were very successful achieving multiple platinum certifications. In 1993 and in 1994, Jugate Conmigo vol. 2 and Jugate Conmigo vol. 3 were the best- selling albums of the year in Argentina.http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=77909 Although the show was panned by critics, it won two Martin Fierro Awards for Best Entertainment Programs.

Concocted in Spain, the plot was the brainchild of Antonio del Giudice, Prince of Cellamare. Background and plot Antonio del Giudice was named the Spanish Ambassador to the French Court in 1715 during the reign of Louis XIV of France; Louis XIV died in September that year and his successor, Louis XV of France, aged five, was put under the care of the Duke of Orl√©ans who was a nephew (as well as son-in-lawPhilippe had married his first cousin Fran√ßoise Marie de Bourbon in 1692; she was the legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan) of the late Louis XIV. Antonio del Giudice went to France during the Regency of Philippe d'Orl√©ans. Philippe d'Orl√©ans, against whom the plot was directed Madame du Maine,Sister-in-law of Fran√ßoise-Marie de Bourbon, the youngest sister of the Duke of Maine a ringleader of the plot At the instigation of Guillaume Dubois, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,He had been named the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs during the Polysynody of 1715 ‚Äì 1718 France formed the Quadruple Alliance between England, Holland and the Holy Roman Empire to combat the possible personal union between France and Spain, should the five-year-old Louis XV die; Spain was then ruled by Louis XV's uncle, Phillip V, who had been king of Spain since the death of Charles II in 1700. The War of the Spanish Succession had resulted in the Treaty of Utrecht of April 1713; that treaty underlined that neither Philip nor his descendants could inherit the French throne, he having agreed to this previously. The Prince of Cellamare and his embassy wanted to depose Philippe d'Orl√©ans from power and make Philip V the Regent for his nephew. The plan was greatly supported by some of Philippe d'Orl√©ans's most notorious enemies, namely the duke and the duchess du Maine, Louis Auguste de Bourbon and his wife, Louise B√©n√©dicte de Bourbon, who had entered into correspondence with Spanish Prime Minister Giulio Alberoni, a favourite of Queen Elisabeth Farnese, and was trying to place her husband, the languid Duke of Maine, on the throne. With the support of the Spanish ambassador, a plot to carry out the transferral was soon woven into the entourage of the duchess. According to the memoirs of the duchess's lady-in-waiting, Baroness de Staal, Melchior de Polignac and the Duke of Richelieu were part of the plot. The Duke of Richelieu was then having a romantic affair with one of the regent's daughters, Charlotte Agla√© d'Orl√©ans. The baroness's memoirs said that the duke and the duchess of Maine had wanted to call a meeting between the √âtats g√©n√©raux on the matter. The correspondence between the duchess of Maine and Alberoni was later intercepted by the police and so was reported to the regent who acted swiftly; on 9 December, the Prince of Cellamare was arrested and sent back to Spain; Alberoni was arrested on 5 December 1718 at Poitiers. The duchess was exiled to Dijon while her husband was imprisoned in the fortress of Doullens in Picardy. The Duke of Richelieu was imprisoned in the Bastille where he was later visited by his lover, Charlotte Agla√© d'Orl√©ans, dressed in disguise. However, the guilty members of the plot were all pardoned by 1720 and allowed to return to their residence. On 9 January 1719, France declared war on Spain, following in the footsteps of England who had done so a couple of weeks earlier, on 27 December 1718. Two years later, the aims of the Cellamare conspiracy were revived in the Pontcallec conspiracy, four leaders of which were executed.

Wiener (c. 1938 - August 2, 2009) was an American business executive who was one of the two founders of the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation in 1972, ran the company as president and chairman, and became a philanthropist after selling the business and its 44 radio stations to Westinghouse Corporation in 1996 for $3.7 billion. Born in Brooklyn, Wiener got his start in the radio business selling radio advertising. He started calling rock and roll \\"American music\\" as a ploy after prospective buyers were reluctant to place ads on stations that played the genre, which they \\"associated with the drug culture and the peace movement\\". He had been selling ad space for Metromedia when he joined together with Gerald Carrus to purchase San Francisco-area radio station KOME in 1972, a station that played free-form rock, with his investment covered with money raised from his wife and associates, along with $5,000 he had obtained after selling his father's stamp collection.Fabrikant, Geraldine. 'Michael A. Wiener, Founder of a Radio Chain, Dies at 71\\", The New York Times, August 3, 2009. Accessed August 3, 2009. As the company grew, both Wiener and Carrus left their day jobs to work full-time at Infinity. Wiener was the company's president starting in 1972 and shifted to chairman in 1979, a position he retained until selling the company. In 1981, they hired Mel Karmazin as president of the radio division, by which time Infinity owned three stations.Staff. \\"Infinity co-founder Michael Wiener has died\\" , Radio Business Report, August 3, 2009.

Over the next decade, Karmazin led Infinity on a buying spree and brought in shock jock Howard Stern, moving the business into successively larger radio markets. Westinghouse Electric Corporation agreed to buy Infinity and its 44 radio stations for $3.7 billion in June 1996, under new regulations enacted under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that allowed greater concentration of ownership in the radio business, paying 1.7 shares of Westinghouse stock for each of the 119 million shares of Infinity.Fabrikant, Geraldine. \\"Two Radio Giants to Merge, Forming Biggest Network\\", The New York Times, June 21, 1996. Accessed August 3, 2009. Though Karmazin was the public face of the company, Wiener and Carrus owned the bulk of the shares, which were worth billions at the time of the Westinghouse deal, and had doubled by the time the company was later acquired by Viacom. Interviewed for an obituary published in The New York Times, Howard Stern lauded Wiener as being \\"smart enough to hire Mel [Karmazin] and give him the freedom\\" to run the business as he saw fit, which included being someone \\"who would take a risk on me\\". He credited Wiener and Carrus with having \\"worked their way into larger markets\\" after starting in smaller markets, a genuine accomplishment given \\"the number of radio stations that go under\\". Philanthropy A long-time philanthropist, Wiener had been a generous giver to the Cardiovascular Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York. Wiener and his wife saw the need to provide integrated treatment for heart disease and became active supporters of the hospital's Dr. Valentin Fuster. In 1997, his son Gabe died at age 26 after experiencing a cerebral aneurysm. In memory of their son, the Wieners dedicated the Gabe Wiener Music and Arts Library at Columbia University. They also endowed the Gabe M. Wiener Memorial Organ, a pipe organ with 4,345 pipes at the Central Synagogue in Manhattan, in memory of their son. Wiener stated in 2005 that his son \\"would really love the way this fills the synagogue with wonderful sounds\\". The Wieners contributed $2 million for the organ, after Columbia University rejected the offer based on concerns about architectural changes to the chapel in which it would have been placed and after rejecting a request by the New York Philharmonic as the Wieners wanted the organ used for music instruction. The Wieners contributed an additional $1 million to Central Synagogue in 2005 to endow a classical music series that featured choral and organ works.Bernstein, Elizabeth. \\"Music Man\\", The Wall Street Journal, May 13, 2005.

The population in 2011 was 432,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 79.87 km¬≤. It lies within the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park, along the western coast of the Algarve in Faro District. The region, typical of the Algarve coastal areas, is dotted with many beaches, with the most important being the beaches of Praia do Amado and Praia da Carrapateira, which attract both local and tourist vacationers. It contains the village of Carrapateira. History Until 1837, the parishes of Carrapateira and Bordeira were actually separate ecclesiastical administrative divisions, of the neighbouring municipality of Vila do Bispo. When these two parishes were converted reallocated during the administrative reforms of Mouzinha de Silveira's government, they were integrated into one parish, and the parish transferred to the settlement of Bordeira which was more secular located in the interior. Geography The ocean escarpment in the region of Pontal, along the coast of the civil parish of Bordeira { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\" } The civil parish is located along the western coast of Portugal, in the southern limit of the municipality of Sabroa, bordered in the north by the civil parish of Aljezur, east by the parish of Bensafrim and south-east by the parish of Bar√£o de S√£o Jo√£o (both in the municipality of Lagos and south by the parish of Vila do Bispo (in the municipality of the same name). The main village of Bordeira is a fairly new one, with wide streets, planted with rows of palms and flowerbeds. It is highlighted by its small chapel, constructed after the 1755 earthquake, heavily carved with gilded interior and retable. The church is dedicated to the patron, Nossa Senhora da Encarna√ß√£o (Our Lady of the Incarnation). The parish seat is nestled in a small basin of the Ribeira do Bordeira, surrounded by protected green countryside. Unlike other small villages that are just whitewashed, the buildings in Bordeira are painted with vibrant colours, highlighting the features of each surface. With many small cobble stone roads, orange and lemon trees and fig orchards, the seat resembles a traditional village, with some of the homes staggered above one another. There is a main caf√©, aptly named Caf√© da Bordeira, that offers light snacks and a limited selection for lunch, while shops and other snack bars cater to the local people. Older buildings have been re-purposed to attract more tourists, including the communal bake oven/house, now been converted into living accommodation. Bordeira is better remembered for its beachfront and sand dunes, popular with surfers who visit Praia da Bordeira for its winds and large waves. Just outside the main village of Bordeira, is a surfing camp.
