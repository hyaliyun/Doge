Species in this genus are worldwide. They parasitize the body cavities, tissues and ovaries of both marine and freshwater fishes. When still in the larval stages, these worms move to the body cavities or subcutaneous tissues in the host. This migration can cause damage to skeletal joints, result in internal bleeding, and inflame visceral organs. Emaciation and lowered growth rates may result from this. Infestation produces nodules under the skin. When the worms are in the adult or juvenile stage, these nodules may be visible between the rays of the fins or may cause the scales to raise up. Larger nodules may be the result of gravid females which may rupture the skin surface. Once ruptured, the female disintegrates. This allows the release of the live larvae into the water. This wound on the fish then heals, leaving almost no scarring. Species of Philometra require two hosts to complete their life cycle. After the larval worms are released from the host fish, they are ingested by copepods which act as an intermediate host. Once inside the copepod, the larvae molt several times. Fish may then eat the infested copepod. Known hosts Species of this genus are known to parasitize numerous species of fish, including: *Blacktip grouper *Herring scad *Bigeye scad *Bluefish Gallery File:Parasite170008-fig1 - Ovary of fish with visible Philometra females.pngOvary of fish with visible Philometra females File:Parasite140007-fig6 Philometra fasciati Moravec & Justine, 2008 (Nematoda, Philometridae).tifPhilometra fasciati File:Parasite140007-fig1 Philometra austropacifica Moravec & Justine, 2014 (Nematoda, Philometridae).tifPhilometra austropacifica File:Parasite140007-fig9 Philometra selaris Moravec & Justine, 2014 (Nematoda, Philometridae).tifPhilometra selaris Parasite140132-fig1 Philometra protonibeae (Nematoda, Philometridae).pngPhilometra protonibeae Parasite140132-fig2 Philometra protonibeae (Nematoda, Philometridae).pngPhilometra protonibeae Parasite140132-fig3 Philometra protonibeae (Nematoda, Philometridae).pngPhilometra protonibeae Parasite140132-fig4 Philometra sp.

Plot Newspapers around the world proclaim the birth of the 3,000th baby in Moosetown, Canada, who was delivered by Dr. John Luke, known for delivering the famous Wyatt quintuplets. To honor the doctor on his retirement and to publicize their town, the Moosetown Chamber of Commerce decides to hold a reunion of all the babies delivered by the doctor. Some of those babies have since become famous. The first baby he delivered, Phillip Crandall, is now a governor. One other is the motion picture star, Janet Fair. Phillip and his wife are childless. Phillip is against adoption because he fears that his opponent in the upcoming election would suggest that the adopted baby was his from the past. He decides to go to the reunion to renew his friendship with Dr. Luke, whom he hasn't seen since a fishing trip twelve years earlier. When Janet, who is down on her luck, learns from her agent that she has the lead in a New York show, she decides to accept the invitation to the reunion for the publicity she hopes it will bring. In Atlanta, the quintuplets' father (Asa Wyatt) is upset when his rival (Constable Jim Ogden) excitedly brags that his wife is due any minute to give birth to six babies because two fortune-tellers have told him so. When Jim's wife gives birth to one baby, Jim is disappointed at first, but as he plays with his new baby daughter he tells her that he'd rather have her than six or sixty babies. After Dr. Luke's nephew Tony arrives from Tennessee to take Dr. Luke's position, Tony receives a call from a woman in Toronto. This upsets nurse Mary McKenzie, Tony's sweetheart. Many of the thousands who come to the reunion throng around Janet, who is pleased to see her old friend, bachelor Charlie Renard. Phillip is attracted to an orphan named Rusty, who Dr. Luke says was born eleven years ago to a woman who died of a broken heart. The mention of the woman's name greatly affects Phillip. Dr. Richard Sheridan and his wife Gloria then arrive from Toronto, and Gloria (the woman who called Tony) tells him that she plans to divorce Dick. Dick is a workaholic whom she no longer loves. When Dr. Luke (surmising the affair between Tony and Gloria) berates his son, Tony admits that he doesn't love Gloria. Although Dr. Luke pleads with him to end the affair, Tony refuses, feeling that he owes it to Gloria to carry on. When Dr. Luke tries to convince Gloria that Tony doesn't love her, but that he loves Mary, she becomes indignant. Dr. Luke then convinces her to freshen up in a bedroom and arranges for Mary to meet Tony in an adjoining room. When Dr. Luke makes Tony admit that an older woman has made a fool of him, Gloria overhears and leaves in an agitated state. Although Tony confesses that he loves Mary, she says she cannot love anyone who could turn his affections off and on at will. At the reunion gathering, Dr. Luke instructs Rusty to repeatedly make a gesture identical to one that Phillip makes. Won over by the boy, Phillip asks Dr. Luke about adoption formalities. When a telegram arrives from Janet's agent stating that the deal for the role in the New York play is off because the producer wants a younger woman, Janet, who is shaken, goes inside. The gathered then watch as the quintuplets arrive, each in a pony-drawn carriage, and play in a fenced-in enclosure. Dick tells Dr. Luke that he and Gloria, after a long talk, have decided to go abroad for a second honeymoon. Gloria shakes Dr. Luke's hand. Dr. Luke then learns that Janet has shot herself. Tony takes charge of the operation with Mary as his assistant. After the operation, Tony tells Charlie that Janet will survive if she has anything to live for. Charlie calls her by her real name, Mamie. Then he kisses her face, and she takes his hand. Tony and Mary reconcile. Dr. Luke's long time nurse, Katherine Kennedy, mildly rebukes him for falsely making Phillip believe that he is Rusty's father.

Actress Maude Eburne's surname is incorrectly spelled Eburn in the onscreen credits. This was the second film featuring the Dionne Quintuplets. Their first film, The Country Doctor, a fictional account of their birth, was released earlier in 1936. The screen credits note that \\"Scenes of the Dionne Quintuplets were photographed at Callander, Ontario under the technical supervision of Dr. Allan R. Dafoe.\\" Dr. Dafoe was the Canadian doctor who delivered the quintuplets on May 28, 1934. According to the pressbook for the film, a company of eighty people from Twentieth Century-Fox arrived in Callander and began filming on August 17, 1936. The quintuplets, who were two years and three months at the time, were filmed for twenty-six days, except Sundays, for one hour a day and were paid $83,000. A special blue filter for the lights, which cameraman Daniel Clark developed for The Country Doctor was also used in this film. Helen Jerome Eddy was listed as a cast member in a The Hollywood Reporter production chart, but her participation in the final film has not been confirmed.

The Thomas Equestrian Center is a program area on the Boy Scout Camp, \\"Camp Cedars,\\" in Saunders County, Nebraska. The program was started by Walter Thomas in 1998 with only four horses. Today, the Thomas Equestrian Center is no longer run by Walter Thomas due to differences among the council leadership but previously was Home to a miniature horse, two miniature donkeys, two ponies, and twenty-two other horses. Location The Thomas Equestrian Center is located next to the COPE tower before the main entrance to Camp Cedars and has three individual areas for horses including an 85 ft diameter arena used for basic riding, along with a 175 ft long arena that is used for jumping, advanced riding, and feeding, and lastly the horses at the Thomas Equestrian Center have the paddock where the horses can get their water, eat their hay and cool off. Outside Camps The Thomas Equestrian Center, unlike most program areas at Camp Cedars, hosts a variety of different camps outside of the Boy Scouts over the course of the summer. Such camps include: *Camp Calvin Crest A group of 15-20 Presbyterian children take part in Camp Calvin Crest's Ranch Camp every week where they drive to the Thomas Equestrian Center mornings from 9:30am to 11:30am Mondays through Fridays to learn, ride, and get to know horses at the Thomas Equestrian Center. *Easter Seals Nebraska Children and adults with physical or mental disabilities come from neighboring Camp Eagle to the Thomas Equestrian Center twice a week at 8:15am to not only groom Melvin the miniature horse and two donkeys, but they get a chance to ride in either a western or side saddle. *Camp Fontanelle Children from Methodist Camp Fontanelle come and spend most of the day at the Thomas Equestrian Center where they get to learn about, ride, groom, and get to know the many horses and donkeys of the Thomas Equestrian Center. As of 2018 this program is no longer. *Project Independence Camps of visually impaired or blind children and adults come to the Thomas Equestrian Center to get to know horses and enjoy themselves through Equine therapyas of 2018 this camp is no longer. Classes The Thomas Equestrian Center has many classes it provides for scouters attending Camp Cedars. As of 2019, these classes are: *Advanced Horsemanship Due to the lack of riding time in the Horsemanship Merit Badge, the Advanced Horsemanship class was create to give scouts, especially older scouts, a week full of learning the finer details of riding from riding in an english saddle, to riding bareback, and playing exciting games such as horse soccer or wild, wild west on horseback. To take this class, you must have the Horsemanship Merit Badge. *Advanced Roping Advanced roping is a great class for scouts who want to work even more with their roping skills. Scouts learn to desensitize a horse to a flying rope and by the end of the week have learned to rope off horseback at both stationary targets and moving cattle- like targets. Scouts must take both Horsemanship Merit Badge as well as Basic Roping before they can take Advanced Roping. *Basic Roping Most scouts who come to the Thomas Equestrian Center have only heard or read about roping but never actually roped. The Basic Roping class teaches scouts about the history of roping from Spain in the 1800s to modern day roping events. Scouts learn to tie a honda knot and parts of the lasso. Scouts enjoy learning to rope and their targets gradually increase in difficulty. Although this class only teaches stationary ground roping, scouts can later take Advanced Roping and take their roping skills to a whole new level. *Basic Riding Skills Although the class is intended for adults, scouts and adults alike may enroll in Basic Riding Skills. In this class, wranglers judge the experience the rider has on horseback whether it be first time or more advanced, and progress the rider through new levels of riding from bareback riding to english saddles, or even riding in faster gaits. *Horsemanship Merit Badge One of two Merit Badges the Thomas Equestrian Center offers, the Horsemanship Merit Badge is requirement based. Although this gives scouts a great amount of book knowledge on horses, requirements only allow for less than two minutes of riding time on horseback. However scouts do learn about horse safety, parts of a horse, breeds of horses, five horse diseases, conformation, lameness and unsoundness, hoof care, grooming, feeding, parts of a saddle and bridle, mounting and dismounting, how to ride, how to lead a horse, storing equipment, and how to saddle and bridle a horse. To take the Horsemanship Merit Badge at the Thomas Equestrian Center, you must be at least 13 years of age. *Medieval Jousting Another class to give riders more horseback time, Medieval Jousting was created to give scouts a once in a lifetime experience cantering down a list towards a wooden target with reins in one hand and a lance in the other. Scouts learn the medieval history of jousting, as well as the modern sport of jousting. Scouts also learn about the history of chainmail. Scouts have a chance to create and bring home their own chainmail creations. *Junior Equestrian Scouts under 13 are not technically allowed to enroll in the Horsemanship Merit Badge until they are 13 years old, however the class Jr. Equestrian was created to provide younger scouts with an opportunity to ride for a week as well as building up skills that will greatly prep and benefit them for when they do take the Horsemanship Merit Badge. Scouts learn to ride as well as playing exciting games on horseback including horse soccer. Unique Activities Scouts attending Camp Cedars can choose to enjoy unique equestrian activities. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TRAIL RIDES ALL PROGRAMS ARE NO LONGER TAUGHT. = Travois = Scouts enrolled in the Indian Lore Merit Badge will receive the opportunity to assemble and ride a horse-pulled travois. Although a travois was originally used by Native Americans for mainly transportation of the elderly or injured, scouts [since 2014] receive the chance to ride and learn about the importance of the travois in Native American culture and tradition. = Painting = Scouts in the Art Merit Badge previously painted pictures of trees to meet requirements. In 2014, the Thomas Equestrian Center proposed that scouts paint a picture of a standing horse. As of 2015, scouts now paint their own pictures and names on the side of the horse. This activity is also available to other visiting camps such as Camp Calvin Crest Ranch Camp. = Overnight = Monday nights, scouts who have completed the Horsemanship Merit Badge are eligible to take a 7 mile total trail ride (with wranglers walking along the whole way) to Camp Eagle's lake as the sun sets. Scouts dismount their horse and set up tarps and sleeping bags where they will sleep under the stars all night long. In the morning, scouts get back up on horses and return to the Thomas Equestrian Center where they are served breakfast and sent to their first class. = Trail Rides = Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are open trail rides. After signing up in the administration office, scouts, adults, and family alike can go on a 2-3 mile trail ride (with wranglers walking along the whole way) through the woods next to the Thomas Equestrian Center. These trail rides take place at 7:00pm, 7:45pm, and 8:15pm. The maximum number of riders depends on the number of available horses. = Open Roping = As of 2014, the Thomas Equestrian Center, in effort to give all scouts a chance to rope, provides open roping Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights at 7:45pm. Attendees will be given ropes and targets and will be taught the necessary roping skills.

The Pico's magazine holds six rounds; one additional round can be held in the chamber. =Features= The Beretta Pico magazine release is of the paddle variety, but much smaller than is ordinary for a weapon employing this feature. This is to aid concealment and a snag-free draw. The design of this release means that it is also ambidextrous in nature. The iron sights can be removed and replaced with the use of a 1.3 mm hex key, as they are dovetailed into the slide of the pistol. The pistol also features a low profile slide stop and locks open on an empty magazine. Additionally, the internals of the pistol are removable to allow changing of grips, or to thoroughly clean the pistol, similar to the Beretta Nano. = Owner feedback = A few reports online show customers complaining of broken or \\"defective\\" firing pins. By and large, this is not the case. The owner's manual states on page 18 that a broken firing pin is the result of dry firing the pistol without dummy rounds in the chamber. Use of dummy rounds will prevent this breakage from occurring. By comparison, some owners have found the Beretta Pico to have a stiff action and heavy trigger. All Beretta Pico pistols manufactured after 2015 use upgraded springs, resulting in a mild improvement to spring weight. Dealers often recommend manipulating the slide of the firearm to ensure that the owner can adequately manipulate it. Accessories The frame of the handgun is available to purchase in multiple colors. Holsters have also been developed for the Beretta Pico by several companies, most noticeably by Beretta, the manufacturer of the handgun. Uses The Pico was designed for self-defense and deep concealment‚Äîits small size and snag-free profile makes it more suitable for pocket or ankle carry than inside-the-waistband carry.

After the conclusion of her NOAA career, she spent several years operating as the University of Puerto Rico marine research vessel R/V Chapman. More recently, she has become the Cura√ßao-based mothership for the deep-diving submarine Curasub.  Construction and commissioning  launching ceremony for NOAAS Chapman (R 446) at the Bender Shipbuilding and Repair Company in Mobile, Alabama, in December 1979. Chapman was built by the Bender Shipbuilding and Repair Company at Mobile, Alabama. She was launched in December 1979, delivered to NOAA in May 1980, and commissioned into service in NOAAs fleet as NOAAS Chapman (R 446)Ships of the NOAA Fleet, Rockville, Maryland: United States Department of Commerce, June 1989 on 11 July 1980 at NOAAs Pacific Marine Center in Seattle Washington.NOAA Ship CHAPMAN Decommissioned After 19 Years Of Service  Characteristics and capabilities  Chapman had a 4-foot (1.2-meter) fixed-length boom with a lifting capacity of 7,500 pounds (3,402 kg) and an A-frame with a safe working load of 1,000 pounds (454 kg). She also had two hydraulic trawl winches, each with a drum capacity of 6,000 feet (1,829 meters) of 3/4-inch (19-mm) line and a maximum pull of 20,000 pounds (9,072 kg), a hydraulic net sonde winch with a drum capacity of 3,937 feet (1,200 meters) and a maximum pull of 500 pounds (227 kg), and a hydraulic oceanographic winch with a drum capacity of 3,250 feet (991 meters) of 3/16-inch (4.8-mm) steel cable and a maximum pull of 84 pounds (38.1 kg). Chapman carried a 16-foot (4.9-meter) Boston Whaler fiberglass boat powered by a gasoline outboard motor. In addition to her crew of 11, Chapman could accommodate up to six scientists.  Service history  Operated by NOAAs Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, Chapman conducted fishery and marine resource research supporting the research of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), collecting fish and crustacean specimens using trawls and benthic longlines and fish larvae, fish eggs, and plankton using plankton nets and surface and midwater larval nets.NOAA Ship Chapman Chapman spent her first four years operating in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea on a variety of projects in support of NMFSs Northwest Fisheries Science Center and Alaska Fisheries Science Center. She conducted a survey of the Bering Sea king crab population each summer which was used to set king crab catch quotas for the following autumn. In November 1984, Chapman moved to her new home port at Pascagoula, Mississippi, and for the remainder of her NOAA career she was devoted exclusively to supporting the Pascagoula Laboratory at NMFSs Southeast Fisheries Science Center, operating in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and western Atlantic Ocean. Her first assignment was to explore the fishery potential of underutilized stocks of Gulf butterfish, squid, and coastal herring. In work closely connected with the emerging field of satellite imagery data acquisition and its application in fisheries science, she located commercially valuable concentrations of these species and characterized and monitored their populations. During her career, Chapman dredged for scallops and trawled for cod off the coast of New England, and conducted winter tagging of striped bass off the Outer Banks of North Carolina. She also made physical oceanographic measurements and plankton collections in the Gulf Stream and the Loop Current, collected red tide organisms, and observed marine mammals. Chapman also tested new designs in fishing gear and the sensors and equipment used to measure and monitor fishing gear performance, and used towed - and later remotely operated - submersibles to observe the performance of fishing gear she was testing. Scientists embarked on Chapman pioneered and developed the capability to measure fish populations using fishery acoustic systems. During her later years, Chapman used fishery acoustic systems to locate spawning aggregations of grouper and to characterize reef fish habitats during annual surveys under the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP). As an alternative to the often environmentally damaging methods of trawling and dredging, scientists aboard Chapman pioneered the use of fixed video cameras deployed on sensitive reef habitats to collect information on the kinds and abundance of reef fishes in a non-destructive manner, a novel approach in fishery data collection. Employing this technique off the Atlantic coast of Florida, Chapman conducted baseline studies of coral reefs that led to the establishment of the Experimental Oculina Research Reserve, one of the first such reserves of its kind. After nearly 18 years of service, Chapman was decommissioned at Pascagoula on 2 June 1998. She was replaced by NOAAS Gordon Gunter (R 336). Later career Donated to the University of Puerto Rico, the ship continued to serve as a research vessel as R/V Chapman, taking scientists and students to sea under the auspices of the university to conduct various kinds of marine research. However, she was not properly maintained, and after less than six years she lost her American Bureau of Shipping safety rating and was taken out of service. In 2008, Substation Cura√ßao purchased Chapman to refurbish her and modify her for use as a seagoing mothership for the deep-diving scientific and tourist submarine Curasub. Modifications involved the installation of amenities for embarked scientists and tourists and of a 110-ton knuckle boom crane on Chapmans after deck to launch and retrieve both the submarine and its floating dock, both of which can be carried on Chapmans after deck. During submarine operations, the floating dock is lowered over the side and secured to Chapman so that Curasubs passengers have an easy and convenient way to embark on and disembark from the submarine without the danger of launching Curasub into the water with them already aboard; Curasub also is lowered over the side and operates from the floating dock, which includes a docking cradle for the submarine. Chapmans redesign also made provision for the temporary installation of two 20-foot (6.1-meter) intermodal containers, one configured for use as a wet laboratory and the other for use as a dry laboratory, which can be carried on her deck when needed for the support of embarked scientists and stored ashore during tourist use of Curasub.Substation Cura√ßao-Chapman Research Centre newsletter, Volume I, No. 1, December 2012 Operating from Cura√ßao, Chapman had begun operations under Chapman Expeditions serving as Curasubs mothership by 2012, when she supported the Smithsonian Institution's Deep Reef Observation Project (DROP).Tarantolo, Andrew, \\"The Curasub: Live the Life Aquatic Without Getting Wet,\\" Gizmodo, 06/03/13 11:30 a.m. See also NOAA ships and aircraft  References  External links Chapman Chapman Chapman NOAAS Chapman NOAAS Chapman NOAAS Chapman ","title":"NOAAS Chapman (R 446)"},{"id":"42994803","text":"Perceptual load theory is a psychological theory of attention. It was presented by Nilli Lavie in the mid-nineties as a potential resolution to the early/late selection debate. This debate relates to the \\"cocktail party problem\\": how do people at a cocktail party select the conversation they are listening to and ignore the others? The models of attention proposed prior to Lavie's theory differed in their proposals for the point in the information processing stream where the selection of target information occurs, leading to a heated debate about whether the selection occurs \\"early\\" or \\"late\\". There were also arguments about to what degree distracting stimuli are processed.  History  Modern research on attention began when Colin Cherry articulated the \\"cocktail party problem\\" in 1953: at a cocktail party how do people select the conversation that they are listening to and ignore the rest? Cherry performed experiments in which subjects would use a set of headphones to listen to two streams of words in different ears and selectively attend to one stream; they would then be asked about the content of the other stream. These experiments showed that subjects take in very little of the information supplied in the stream they are not focusing on. Donald Broadbent used results of this kind of experiment to develop his filter model of attention, which suggests that humans process information with limited capacity, and therefore information must be selected by a sensory filter soon after it is received. All information in the filter that is not directly attended to will decay. In contrast, Deutsch and Deutsch argued that this filtering of irrelevant stimuli occurs in the late stages of processing: all of the information is processed on a sensory level, but the semantic content of the message in the unattended ear cannot access the consciousness.  Proposal of perceptual load theory  Lavie attempted to resolve the early/late selection debate by arguing that both early and late selection occur depending on the stimulus presented. She introduced the concept of perceptual load, referring to the complexity of the physical stimuli, particularly the distractor stimuli. For example, a square surrounded by circles is a scene with low perceptual load, whereas a square surrounded by many different shapes has higher perceptual load. =Key assumptions= Perceptual load theory makes three main assumptions: # Attentional resources are limited in capacity; # Task-relevant stimuli are processed before task-irrelevant stimuli; # All of the attentional resources must be used. Thus, if the task-relevant stimulus uses all the attentional resources, none of the task-irrelevant stimuli (distractors) will be processed. In high-load tasks the target's attentional resources are depleted faster than in a low-load task. The target will therefore be selected sooner and the distractors will be quickly filtered out. In a low-load task, more of the distractors will be processed because the attentional resources have not been exhausted, and the filtering step will occur later. In a low- load situation the distractors will be perceived, potentially causing an interference. In this model, selection occurs both in the early stages of processing (high-load condition) and in the late stages (low-load condition). Criticism = Distractor salience = An alternative theory proposed to explain Lavie's results is distractor salience. This theory argues that the salience, or prominence, of a distractor is the primary factor in causing distraction, rather than the overall load. =Attentional zoom= A second alternative explanation for Lavie's results is attentional zoom, which suggests that the apparent difference between high-load and low-load conditions is not due to the overall load, but instead to the degree of localization of the participant's field of attention. Attentional zoom theory proposes that participants can process distractors that are within their attentional focus. When an individual is induced to have a small attentional focus and the distractors fall outside of the focus, minimal processing of the distractors and interference is seen. A larger attentional focus that includes distractors leads to a higher level of inference. = Locus versus efficiency = Lavie's PhD supervisor, Yehoshua Tsal, the senior author on the original paper, published a critical review of the perceptual load theory in 2013 with Hanna Benoni. The review argues that perceptual load theory has been misconstrued as a hybrid solution to the early selection versus late selection debate, and that it is instead an early selection model: selection occurs because attention is necessary for semantic processing, and the difference between high-load and low-load conditions is a result of the fact that selection is efficient in high-load conditions but inefficient in low-load conditions. Benoni and Tsal argue that perceptual load theory deserves recognition not for proposing a hybrid model of attention, but for shifting the focus from the locus of attentional selection to the more important question of the efficiency of attentional selection. Benoni and Tsal also argue that the nature of perceptual load has never been precisely defined, leading to circularity in characterizing load and in analyzing the results of differences in load.

California, 412 U.S. 546 (1973), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the high court ruled that California's state statutes criminalizing record piracy did not violate the Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution..  Background  Between April 1970 and March 1971, Goldstein purchased recordings (vinyl or tape) and reproduced them, without any contractual permission from or payment to the rights holders, onto blank tapes, which he then distributed for sale. He was charged under a California statute that made it a criminal offense to duplicate and sell records or tapes without permission from the owners of the master recording. At the time of the infringement, there was no federal copyright law covering sound recordings ( sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972 remain outside the purview of federal copyright law). Goldstein argued that California lacked authority to enact state copyright law that conflicted with federal law under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, and that its unlimited duration conflicted with the provision of the Copyright Clause which states that \\"exclusive Right[s]\\" of copyright be for \\"limited Times\\".  Holding  Justice Warren Burger, writing for the 5-4 majority, held that the Copyright Clause did not exclusively invest Congress with the power to enact copyright law, and thus state copyright was in principle valid. If states choose to protect more copyrightable works than the federal government does, they are not prohibited from doing so by the Supremacy Clause. He also held that state laws are not subject to the durational limitation the Copyright Clause enforces on federal copyright. Justice William O. Douglas filed a dissent asserting that the Supremacy Clause was implicated in state extension of copyright to materials not protected federally, just as it would for a state extension of duration beyond the term of a federally granted copyright. Justice Thurgood Marshall filed a separate dissent, arguing that Congressional copyright decisions reflected a balance between free competition and the promotion of invention (as stated in the Copyright Clause), and that, piracy's unsavoriness notwithstanding, unless Congressional action indicated that copyright was needed to promote invention in this case, no copyright protection could be afforded by states in lieu.

Built in 1859 in Parkersburg, West Virginia, she was long, wide, and deep. Her first significant service was in 1860, when she was used as a packet steamer on the Red and Ouachita Rivers, under master and co-owner Samuel Applegate. In 1861, after the start of the American Civil War, she was contracted to the government of the Confederate States of America, and was used to transport men and war materiel. She was used to supply the defenders of Port Hudson, Louisiana, in 1864. That year she was captured by the Union Army forces of General Frederick Steele when she was about below Camden, Arkansas on the Ouachita River. Steele was at the time engaged in a major expedition whose goal was to reach Shreveport, Louisiana, but had stalled due to Confederate resistance and a lack of supplies. Steele had then occupied Camden, and it was during this occupation that the ship was taken, loaded with grain and other supplies. The Union forces piloted her back to Camden. After having an attempted resupply operation thwarted by the Battle of Mark's Mills, Steele decided to abandon Camden. On April 26, 1864, Union troops left the city, abandoning or destroying equipment and supplies his draft teams were unable to haul, and scuttling all of the ships they held, including the Homer. Returning Confederate troops, observing that her cabin remained above water, were able to recover planking from the ship to fashion rafts to facilitate their crossing of the river in pursuit of Steele. The Homer's wreck site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. It was, at the time of its listing, the only known steamer wreck on the Ouachita, and one of a small number such wrecks in Arkansas.

The asteroid was visible in telescopes with objectives of or larger; high-end binoculars under a dark sky may also have worked. Near closest approach the asteroid was moving about 2.5 degrees per hour (2.5 arcseconds per second). The asteroid came to opposition (furthest elongation in the sky from the Sun) on 27 January 2015 at 04:37 UTC. Around 5:00 UTC, the asteroid was near M44 (the Beehive Cluster).

According to the official newspaper Global Times, \\"The film is an exploration of the belief that the US remains China's enemy and has never stopped its strategies to westernize and divide China.\\"Huang Jingjing, Global Times, \\"'Silent Contest' silenced,\\" November 17, 2013. Accessed June 7, 2014 Some analysts have called it a \\"masterpiece\\" of political propaganda, while others called it \\"eerie,\\" \\"paranoid,\\" \\"bizarre,\\" or \\"alarming.\\" Silent Contest consists primarily of interviews with hawkish Chinese military scholars and analysts, interspersed with narration that drives the explanation of the U.S. plot. It first circulated among military enthusiasts and Internet users in China in late October, 2013.  U.S.-led Conspiracy  The central thesis of the documentary is that the United States is engaged in a global conspiracy to hold China back, hamper its development, and ultimately topple the Chinese Communist Party using the doctrine of \\"peaceful evolution.\\" Among the alleged tactics that Washington seeks to use against China are military- to-military exchanges and communications during times of crisis, which the leaders of both countries have publicly advocated. ‚ÄúWe have to take careful precaution and look out for the smallest detail, and build a strong political and ideological line of defense,‚Äù says General Wang Xibin, the president of National Defense University, in the documentary. There are a range of key tools that the United States is said to use to carry out this scheme: Political infiltration, cultural infiltration, change of public opinion, ideological infiltration, organizational infiltration, political interference, and social infiltration. Western support for leaders of Chinese minorities, such as the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, and the Uyghur dissident Rebiya Kadeer, are also singled out as problematic. ‚ÄúConflict and struggle with the American hegemonic system is inevitable on the path of China‚Äôs national rejuvenation,‚Äù the film says, in the introductory sentences. ‚ÄúIt is a century-long battle.\\" = Infiltration = The documentary begins by referring to the idea of transgenes, the process of modifying an organism, or taking a part of one organism and moving it to another. \\"\\"Transgene\\" appears to cause no harm to the targeted species, but just uses modern genetic technology to introduce a small improvement in that species,\\" the narrator says. \\"However, this tiny genetic change, no matter how small it may look, not only destroys the full features of the original species; it also places the new species under the control of the entity that introduced the change.\\" The documentary argues that the United States is trying to carry out just such a plot against the People's Republic of China. \\"It is clear that in the new era, the U.S. has become smarter and more active in the use of political and cultural infiltration and soft war methods,\\" the documentary says. \\"Its 'cultural and political infiltration and soft war methods' have not only become a main strategy for the U.S. to maintain its hegemony, but also a stealth weapon of mass destruction that Western politicians use to change the world.\\" = 'Westernizing' China = According to Silent Contest, the United States and other Western nations have never abandoned the idea that they wish to \\"Westernize\\" or even split China by spreading pro-Western propaganda under the banner of democracy, freedom, and human rights to try to ultimately have China's political system reform along the lines of Western countries. Non- governmental organizations are said to be one of the key tools used in this strategy. Groups like the Ford Foundation, the International Republican Institute, the Carter Center, and the Asia Society are all part of the alleged plot and \\"doing their utmost to access the grassroots elections in our country and provide different forms of support for the reform of local governance.\\" The organizations are said to be part of a project to \\"brainwash\\" China. The film also targets Chinese intellectuals and scholars, including Mao Yushi, a liberal economist who has been awarded the Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty, He Weifang, a well-known professor of law at Peking University, and Xia Yeliang, a former college professor who was forced into exile. = The CIA's 'Ten Commandments' = A number of analysts described the section of the film discussing the \\"Ten Commandments\\" as the highlight. These \\"commandments\\" were allegedly part of the Central Intelligence Agency's handbook on dealing with China during the Bill Clinton administration. The list of activities that the CIA is said to engage in includes: * \\"Using material things to lure... young people, encourage them to despise their leaders and oppose what they have been taught\\" * \\"Do propaganda work well including TV, movies, books and radio broadcasts to make them desire our things, our forms of entertainment...\\" * \\"Direct young people‚Äôs attention towards sports, pornographic books, entertainment, games, crime films, and religious superstition\\" * \\"Create contradictions and division between ethnicities\\" * \\"Continuously create news to uglify their leaders\\" * \\"Use all resources to destroy China‚Äôs traditional values, exterminate and destroy their self-respect and self-confidence, and attack their hardy spirit‚Ä¶\\"  Official Provenance  At the end of the film, several lines of credits in Chinese appear identifying it as a product of the National Defense University's Information Management Center (ÂõΩÈò≤Â§ßÂ≠¶‰ø°ÊÅØÁÆ°ÁêÜ‰∏≠ÂøÉ). Among the other producers of the film are the General Staff Department of the PLA and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. In a press conference on October 31, 2013, Yang Yujun, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, said \\"we will not comment.\\" The film was then purged from domestic Chinese websites. Although the National Defense University does not have its own website, according to the concluding film credits, the specific individuals responsible for the film were the National Defense University's Political Commissar Liu Yazhou, and its president Wang Xibin. \\"As such, the film appears to offer a remarkably straightforward glimpse into the Cold War mind-set of the Chinese military leadership, as well as the deep suspicions of the United States festering inside one of the most influential institutions in the Chinese political system,\\" wrote the New York Times. It was produced in June 2013. The documentary is voiced by Ren Zhihong, a well-known narrator and anchor of China Central Television's National Treasure Archive program. It included extensive use of historical footage, interviews with high-level political figures, and scholars inside and outside China. Top-level Chinese military officials were also interviewed. The documentary does not present a \\"radical new attack\\" on the United States but instead explains what has been a longstanding \\"politically correct view of US- China relations.\\" Whether the film appeared on the Internet as a matter of deliberate policy or as an actual leak, posted without authorization, was a matter of debate among analysts. Given that Communist Party propaganda authorities can often act immediately to remove content and could easily have discovered the source of a leak, one analyst suggested a leak to have been unlikely. \\"If the leak was indeed authorized, it would probably have been at some level of the PLA General Political Department, which appears to be responsible for its production, given the prominence of the NDU Political Commissar as Producer.\\"  Reaction  According to the anti-communist New Tang Dynasty Television the film stirred up counter-attacks by Chinese Internet users. Some called the content \\"brain-dead\\", \\"ridiculous\\", \\"absurd,\\" and a \\"comedy masterpiece.\\" The idea that social conflict in China‚Äîincluding such phenomena as social unrest, official corruption, protests against human rights abuses, the spread of Christianity, and so on‚Äîcould be the result of a U.S. conspiracy, was found unconvincing by a number of individuals who saw the documentary. J. Michael Cole, a commentator on Chinese and Taiwanese affairs‚Äîwhile appearing to acknowledge the official source of the film‚Äîwrote that \\"we must regard the documentary as part of the ongoing dialogue and jockeying for influence that is occurring within the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], and not as a policy statement.\\" He added that if indeed it was the official position, \\"the ramifications of that shift could be far reaching.\\" \\"Not only could exchanges with the U.S. and other major Western powers suffer, but a country like Taiwan, which is often touted as a model for China and whose growing interactions with the Asian giant it is hoped will spark the flame of democratization, could also suffer the consequences,\\" Cole wrote. \\"If Taiwan‚Äôs democracy and open society are regarded as a Western import and part of a U.S.-led plot to undermine China, the CCP could conclude that it is in its best interest to pre-empt Taiwan by destroying its liberal way of life, a process that some argue has already begun.\\" Geoff Wade, a visiting fellow at the College of Asia and the Pacific, Australian National University, described the documentary as \\"controversial\\" and \\"highly polemical.\\" \\"The PLA was intimately involved in the making of the film,\\" he added. For Wade, it appeared to be a reaction to the United States' \\"pivot\\" to Asia and America's attempt to increase engagement with the region since 2011. \\"With such a range of august national institutions being involved in the production of the film, it might be suggested that the rather extreme sentiments expressed therein are not restricted to some hawkish elements in the PLA.\\" Frank Ching, a newspaper columnist in Hong Kong, called the documentary \\"alarming,\\" while Lau Nai- keung, a Hong Kong political figure, writing in the Communist Party's own newspaper China Daily, said it \\"sent an eerie message around the world.\\" Wade said that many of the claims in the documentary also chime with the broader irredentist, revisionist, and expansionary program being carried out and advocated by the Chinese military and the Communist Party's propaganda organs. Andrew Chubb, an analyst of Chinese military propaganda, described the video as \\"really quite a masterpiece.\\" ‚ÄúThe people that produced this documentary are the most representative of the orthodox communist ideology in the Party,‚Äù said Shi Cangshan, an analyst of Party affairs quoted by Epoch Times. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think these views are too representative of those of the central leadership, but more the people in the military.‚Äù  See also  National Defense University * People's Liberation Army * Central Propaganda Department * People's Liberation Army General Staff Department * Political warfare * Ten Commandments References Chinese films Chinese propaganda films Anti-American sentiment in China ","title":"Silent Contest"},{"id":"42995166","text":"The 1977 Sumba earthquake (also called the Sumbawa earthquake) occurred approximately south of Bima, Sumbawa, and beneath the Indian Ocean, at .

Life K√ºnstler, whose father was a barber, worked at a post office in Kassel in 1915, against the wishes of his parents, after completing his school career. From 1919, he was a Berufssoldat (professional soldier) and served for 12 years in the Reichswehr, where he attended the Heeresfachschule f√ºr Verwaltung und Wirtschaft (Army Technical School of Management and Economics) in addition to various training courses. His marriage in 1929 resulted in two children. K√ºnstler, who rose in the Reichswehr to the rank of Feldwebel, retired from the military in 1931. In 1931, he joined the SS (member no. 40,005) and then also the Nazi Party (member no. 1,238,648). From 1931, he served full-time in the SS. From 1934 to 1935, he was assigned to the SS-Verf√ºgungstruppe in J√ºterbog and then briefly to the SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde Brandenburg. After a completed course at the SS- Junkerschule Bad T√∂lz in 1936, he was transferred to the SS-Totenkopfstandarte Oberbayern and rose to become its commander in December 1939. Concentration camp commandant In January 1939, K√ºnstler became commandant at Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp after the previous commandant Jakob Weiseborn had committed suicide on 20 January 1939. Under K√ºnstler, who was regarded as arbitrary, the death toll skyrocketed. In addition, he was responsible for mass executions of Polish and Soviet prisoners, introduced a special two-week holiday for the guards, and also shot prisoners on the run. In August 1942, K√ºnstler was relieved from his post as commandant of the camp by Oswald Pohl. He was succeeded for two months by his deputy, Schutzhaftlagerf√ºhrer Karl Fritzsch, before Egon Zill was appointed camp commandant. The reasons for K√ºnstler's dismissal as camp commandant lay in his debauchery and his chronic alcohol abuse. K√ºnstler, like other concentration camp commandants and personnel, was caught in the sights of SS judge Georg Konrad Morgen, who prosecuted corruption in the concentration camps. After that, he was demoted to the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen and probably died in the Battle of Nuremberg in April 1945. K√ºnstler was declared dead in Erlangen in 1949.This article contains a translation of the corresponding article in the German Wikipedia Bibliography Karin Orth: Die Konzentrationslager-SS. dtv, Munich 2004, * Tom Segev.

It has smooth powdery bark, egg-shaped to lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three, white flowers and variably-shaped fruit. The Jaru peoples know it as warlarri. Description Corymbia flavescens is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, powdery bark that is bright white when new and is shed in thin, greyish scales. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are yellowish green, heart-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide on a short petiole. Adult leaves are mostly arranged alternately, more or less the same shade of yellow-green on both sides, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are perfumed and arranged in leaf axils, appearing as if on a branched peduncle up to long, each branch of the peduncle with three buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear- shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from April to June, or from November to December and the flowers are white or creamy white and perfumed. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, cylindrical, barrel-shaped or conical capsule long and wide. Seeds are a dull to semi-glossy red or red- brown colour, limpet-shaped or oval. Taxonomy and naming Corymbia flavescens was first formally described in 1995 by Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson from a specimens collected in 1925 by William Blakely and published the description in the journal Telopea. Blakely described the specimens as \\"a garden hybrid\\", but Hill and Johnson considered that there were \\"no characters indicating hybridism\\". Distribution and habitat Cabbage ghost gum occurs on red earth soils, often along watercourses. In Western Australia it is found in the Central Kimberley, Dampierland, Great Sandy Desert, Northern Kimberley, Ord Victoria Plain, Pilbara, Tanami and Victoria Bonaparte IBRA bioregions. In the Northern Territory it is found in the Davenport Murchison Ranges, Gulf Fall and Uplands, Mitchell Grass Downs, Mount Isa Inlier and Sturt Plateau IBRA bioregions. Response to fire This eucalypt regrows from a lignotuber and epicormic shoots in response to fire. As a result, the tree has a lower than 30% mortality rate even if all of its leaves are scorched during a bushfire.

In 2012, she recorded her first solo album, 11 de Novembre, which was nominated for album of the year in both Spain and France. A song performed by her, \\"No Te Puedo Encontrar\\", received a Goya Award for best original song for 2012. In 2014, she released her album Granada. Both releases have been in collaboration with Ra√ºl Fern√°ndez Mir√≥. She received another Goya Award for best original song, for the song \\"Ai, ai, ai\\", composed and performed by her, from the film \\"Cerca de tu casa\\" (2016). Background Cruz's parents were both singers who sang together. Her mother Gl√≤ria Cruz i Torrellas taught her to play the saxophone and piano as well as how to dance and sculpt. Her father C√†stor P√©rez Diz was a self-taught guitarist. She has a daughter. She went to Catalonia College of Music in Barcelona, where she received classical training studying the piano and saxophone and receiving a degree in vocal jazz. While she was at Catalonia College of Music, she and three other women founded a flamenco group called Las Migas. They combined their different musical approaches to create a new type of flamenco. It was not long after this that she became well known in the Spanish music scene. Cruz told NPR that a song must have a story. She believes that her view of songs as stories comes from her mother who was a singer and storyteller. Her mother, she said, also viewed songs as stories. 11 de Novembre In 2012, Cruz released her album 11 de Novembre with Raul Fernandez Mir√≥. She met Mir√≥ in 2006 and they toured together in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil. Mir√≥ was both guitarist and producer for the album. Their songs have been described as a blend of music genres including Fado, jazz improvisation, and flamenco. Cruz won a Goya Award, Spain's most prestigious film award, for best original song \\"No Te Puedo Encontrar\\" in the film Blancanieves. The album received a Gold Award disc. Granada In 2014, Cruz released her second album Granada, again collaborating with Fernandez Mir√≥. It reflects Cruz's practice of singing in multiple languages: French, German, English, and four Iberian languages. Included on the album is the song \\"El Cant Dells Ocells,\\" a Catalan folk song previously made famous by Pablo Casals. Another song is \\"Gallo Rojo, Gallo Negro\\", a well-known song from the Spanish Civil War. Cruz first understood the story in the song when she was part of a concert honoring the remaining veterans of the International Brigades who fought against the Nationales in the civil war. Cruz told NPR that she saw tears in the veterans' eyes when they sang the song in their own language. She said, \\"These people have lived through so much. It's good that I can sing and help them remember.\\" As journalist Betto Arcos concluded, this example illustrates how Cruz comes to understand the stories in the songs she sings.

The system used the existing black and white signal but with the addition of a component intended only for television receivers designed to show color. By careful application this 'colored' signal was ignored by ordinary TV sets and had negligible effect on the appearance of the black and white image. This meant that color programs were viewable on the many existing black and white receivers which fulfilled a requirement for 'compatibility' desired by the television industry. Once the so called 'composite' video signal containing the color component had been generated it could be handled just as if it were a black and white signal, eliminating the need to replace much of the existing TV infrastructure. Colorplexer was the RCA name for the equipment that created this 'composite' color signal from three separate images each created in the primary colors, Red, Green and Blue supplied by a color video camera. This process was by the standards of the day quite complex and demanded accurate control of all the various parameters involved if an acceptable color image was to be achieved. The simplification afforded by this 'head end' approach became evident and contributed to the gradual acceptance of color programming over the following decades. National standard The National Television System Committee, NTSC, standard was the analog television system that was used in most of the North America from 1941 until the mandatory cutover to ATSC in 2009. However, low-power TV stations were permitted to operate with NTSC, for now, but many have since converted to ATSC. This national standard was later adopted (or, in some cases, adapted) in other jurisdictions, such as Japan. The Second NTSC Standard (525/30, 1941 and later) anticipated that the extant monochrome TV system would eventually incorporate a provision for monochrome-compatible color television. The First NTSC Standard (441/30, pre-1941) had no such expectation, as even the extant motion picture 3-color system, \\"Three-Strip\\" Technicolor, was then only five years old. The Second NTSC Standard, as revised for color, sometimes called EIA RS-170a, was operational in North America and elsewhere from 1953 until this standard was replaced by ATSC in the early 21st century. Central to this revised standard was a mandate for an information stream, at the transmitter, and broadcast to TV sets (receivers), which was independent of whether the signal was monochrome (already in existence since 1941) or color (adopted in 1953). This significant mandate was satisfied by an encoding device which came to be known as a Colorplexer. Signal management Colorplexer (a portmanteau of \\"color\\" and \\"multiplexer\\") was the RCA trade name for its complex electronic device which encoded discrete red, green and blue 3-color images, as from a color camera, into a composite monochrome-compatible color information stream. In RCA's recommendation for monochrome-compatible color TV, generally called \\"NTSC color\\", each color TV source (as, from a CCU) incorporated its own colorplexer, thereby providing the remaining equipment, all of which were presumed to have originated as a monochrome equipment system, with a signal which could be managed (generated, switched, transmitted, received, etcetera) as if the signal was not color at all, but was an ordinary composite monochrome signal. This was a strategic decision on RCA's part, and this \\"one Colorplexer per color source\\" concept became part of RCA's color TV equipment marketing recommendations. While it made each color source significantly more complicated, hence more expensive, it also obviated the need for major changes to a TV station's signal management system, and the cost of signal management (particularly for networks involving widely separated sources and destinations, such as RCA's wholly owned NBC-TV network) was seen as considerably higher in cost than the color signal sources themselves, as otherwise it would have to be changed from a (composite) Y-only management system into a (component) R-, G- and B-management system (thereby effectively tripling the cost of color signal distribution). Using today's three-phase electrical system in an analogy, overlaying an R-, G- and B-color TV signal management system upon an existing monochrome TV signal management system would be analogous to requiring public utility power systems to convert from three-phase to nine-phase electricity, an insurmountable cost penalty. The Second NTSC Standard did not specifically mandate RCA's \\"one Colorplexer per color source\\" recommendation, as long as the signal actually transmitted to the signal's end user was monochrome-compatible, and this could have been satisfied by an R, G and B signal management system, and a single Colorplexer at the transmitter, and this would have been adequate for small-market TV stations, particularly those with video sources which were co-located at the station's transmitter site. However, the obvious high cost of R-, G- and B-signal management within a large-market TV station, with separate studio and transmitter sites (sources and destinations separated by perhaps one to tens of miles), or particularly within a TV network, with geographically widely separated sources and destinations (sources and destinations separated by perhaps hundreds to thousands of miles), resulted in adoption of RCA's \\"one Colorplexer per color source\\" recommendation almost universally, and particularly after Ampex's introduction of color videotape in 1958 (which was never a component system at all, but was always inherently a composite system), and Ampex's (and, later, RCA's) color videotape systems became essential subsystems of multi-time-zone (national, or, indeed, international) network color TV distribution and transmission. Initially, the instability of the early Colorplexers caused many operational problems as no two Colorplexers were adjusted alike, and these had to be constantly \\"tweaked\\", as did the video sources themselves. Eventually, Colorplexer stability improved, as did the stability of the video sources, and NTSC color would go on to provide consistently good color, and it did so until 2009, nearly 56 years, a remarkable technological achievement, as, compared with \\"Three-Strip\\" Technicolor, perhaps the \\"exemplar\\" for color motion pictures, which lasted only 19 years (from 1936 to 1955). Encoder The R, G and B primary color signals are passed through a \\"matrix\\" to derive the luminance signal, Y, which is the monochrome equivalent of the three primary colors. With the addition of inputs from the synchronizing generator, which supplies the blanking and composite synch signals, and inputs from the color burst generator, which supplies the 3.579545 MHz color burst and the \\"burst gate\\" signals, the colorplexer, using an \\"encoder\\", synthesizes a compatible signal which includes luminance (described earlier) and chrominance (an amplitude-modulated suppressed-carrier signal with \\"I\\" and \\"Q\\" in quadrature, and which represents the differences between the color signals and the monochrome signal), the combination of which produces a monochrome-compatible color information stream. The \\"burst gate\\" admits eight cycles of the 3.579545 MHz \\"color burst\\" and applies this to the \\"back porch\\" of each horizontal synch pulse (the vertical synch is unaffected). These eight cycles are just enough to supply a color TV receiver with a reference with which it can correct its own 3.579545 MHz local oscillator as to frequency and phase, phase being the most significant aspect of the process of recovering the \\"I\\" and \\"Q\\" signals. The \\"matrix\\" adopted by RCA was Y = 0.30R + 0.59G + 0.11B; the three weighting factors were selected such that their sum was 1.0. As with \\"prior art\\" two- color systems, such as pre-1932 Technicolor, the G signal predominates the R signal; and, as with \\"prior art\\" three-color systems, such as 1932 and later \\"Three-Strip\\" Technicolor, the G and R signals predominate the B signal. RCA's color system was developed while \\"Three-Strip\\" Technicolor was the \\"gold standard\\", and Eastman Kodak's Eastmancolor would not completely displace \\"Three-Strip\\" Technicolor for another half-decade. Indeed, RCA's P22 CRT phosphor was intended to mimic Technicolor's dramatic color palette. In most practical color systems, including RCA's, the G signal is taken to be the reference as it has the highest resolution. Indeed, in 1932 to 1944 \\"Three- Strip\\" Technicolor, the image was enhanced by printing a monochrome image which was taken from a 0.5G negative (called the \\"key\\" image, and hence that color system was really an RGBK system, not unlike graphic arts' YCMK system) on the film's \\"blank receiver\\" before the color dyes were applied, as an edge enhancement measure. Edge enhancement is now a part of many electronically based color systems, but in \\"Three-Strip\\" Technicolor's day, it was accomplished photographically from the G image, the sharpest of the three. Monochrome compatibility Conventional monochrome TV sets will accept this signal as if there were no chrominance or burst signals at all. A monochrome image, Y, with minimal or no defects (such as moir√©, etcetera) will be displayed. The \\"I\\", \\"Q\\" and \\"color burst\\" signals will be ignored, leaving only the monochrome image. Color Compatibility Color TV sets will accept this signal and will, first, separate the monochrome image, Y, and will, second, decode the \\"I\\" and \\"Q\\" signals, using the extracted \\"color burst\\" 3.579545 MHz signal as a phase reference to decode these signals. Applying the monochrome image and the decoded \\"I\\" and \\"Q\\" signals to the mathematical inverse of the \\"matrix\\" reverse synthesizes the R, G and B primary color signals, which were applied to a \\"shadow mask\\" or equivalent TV tube, and which displays a 3-color color image.

David Starr Jordan was built for the purpose of fisheries research in the tropical Pacific Ocean. She spent her career studying the biological and physical oceanography off the southwestern coast of the United States and in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean off the coasts of Central America and South America in support of the management of fish, marine mammal, and sea turtle populations. Her home port was San Diego. David Starr Jordans first assignment in January 1966 was to take part in the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI), a joint effort by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (taken over by NOAA after its formation in 1970) and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography to assess fish populations off the coast of California. It became a long-term commitment for her.

Operated by NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations after NOAA was established on 3 October 1970, David Starr Jordan supported NOAAs National Marine Fisheries Service Southwest Fisheries Science Center Laboratory in La Jolla, California. Dolphin population assessment in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean was one of her longstanding missions, and she was an integral part of the marine mammal surveys conducted by the laboratorys Protected Resources Division, including the Stenella Abundance Research Project (STAR), a three-year study of dolphin stocks taken as incidental catch by the yellowfin tuna purse-seine fishery in the eastern tropical Pacific. When assessing dolphin populations, she operated in cooperation with NOAAs MD 500 helicopter, which provided aerial photography support; from the photographs, scientists could measure the length of individual animals and count the number of dolphins in selected schools, which then could be used to calibrate estimates of the sizes of schools of dolphins made by observers aboard David Starr Jordan. Data David Starr Jordan collected were critical in supporting the \\"dolphin-safe‚Äù tuna campaign and labeling requirements and led to a major reduction in dolphin mortalities related to the operations of the yellowfin tuna industry. Researchers embarked on David Starr Jordan investigated seasonal variations in ocean temperature, currents and salinity. David Starr Jordan also conducted an annual juvenile striped bass survey, shark surveys, and occasional special research work required by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center Laboratory. She took part in several research expeditions that took her as far afield as Mexico, Peru, and the Galapagos Islands. In all David Starr Jordan logged over 1,300,000 nautical miles (2,400,000 km) and spent an estimated 8,949 days at sea, averaging over 240 days at sea per year. She measured and weighed 1,000 sea turtles, took 27,000 photographs using remotely operated vehicles, and conducted 27,000 oceanographic sampling casts, 22,000 plankton tows, and 4,700 fish trawls.

Elected in 1871 for a one-year term, the municipality formed the township of Tucson with two sections of land purchased from the U.S. government. In 1874 DeLong represented the Tucson area in the 8th Arizona Territorial Legislature. Early years He was born to Mary Huston DeLong of Grand Isle, Vermont on December 28, 1828 in Beekmantown, New York. His father was from Goshen, Vermont. His parents met and married in Beekmantown where his father was a schoolteacher. His father died in 1832, when DeLong was three years old. He attended elementary school in Upstate New York, high school in Isle La Motte, Vermont. He studied civil engineering at the military academy in Plattsburgh, New York. Upon graduating he assisted in surveying the railroad line from Plattsburgh to Montreal. In 1848 the California Gold Rush started. In 1849 DeLong sailed from New York, around Cape Horn, and arrived in San Francisco, California, in 1850. DeLong settled in Amador County where he worked as a placer miner and taught school. Civil War years After the outbreak of the American Civil War, DeLong enlisted as a private at the Presidio, August 18, 1861. He mustered into Company C, 1st California Infantry August 26. On May 22, 1862, Delong, along with 1,500 California volunteers, 500 being cavalrymen, entered Tucson. Private DeLong was mustered out February 19, 1863, to accept a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant and was transferred to Company B. He was promoted to 1st Lieutenant May 4, 1864. Lieutenant DeLong was mustered out in New Mexico Territory, October 31, 1864, and re-enlisted that same day to be mustered into Company B, 1st California Veteran Infantry Battalion. Lieutenant DeLong was mustered out in New Mexico Territory July 11, 1866. DeLong served as acting assistant Quartermaster at Fort West, Fort Cummings, and Santa Fe in New Mexico, and Fort Goodwin, and Fort Tucson, in Arizona. Post Military years After mustering out of the army in Santa Fe, DeLong returned to Tucson to work for Estevan Ochoa's freighting and mercantile firm Tully & Ochoa. On March 20, 1880 the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived in Tucson and business for freighting by horse-drawn wagon collapsed. DeLong left Tully & Ochoa to trade at Fort Bowie, and later mined gold in the Dos Cabezas, Arizona. In 1898 DeLong returned to Tucson, moving to 199 Church Street. From 1905 until his death DeLong was Secretary of the Arizona Pioneer Society, except one year when he was Receiver of the United States Land Office. Sidney R. DeLong died on November 24, 1914 in Tucson, Arizona. He is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Tucson.

Peripheral halachic discussion of the topic revolves upon whether or not a husband may engage in varying sexually-gratifying acts with his wife ‚Äì including fellatio ‚Äì performed up to ejaculation. The opinions below use the term 'biyah sheloh kedarka' in their original hebrew text, which refers to anal sex, not any form of extra-vaginal ejaculation. This distinction is very important, as these same authorities do in fact prohibit ejaculation through other forms of extra- vaginal sex, such as oral sex, etc. Oral sex, up until ejaculation, is entirely permitted according to most talmudic and halachic authorities. Ejaculation should take place within the vagina. The discussion includes the opinion of the permitting authorities limiting their permit to specific frequencies and timings, the consensus being that any halachic-permit (\\"hetter\\") is solely applicable within the exclusive framework of a Torah- permitted marital relationship and strictly during the time that one's wife is not in her niddah state. Maimonides In the original Hebrew text of the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides, as translated by Yosef Qafih, he takes a lenient approach that permits all that a man desires to do with his wife. The presentation omits the customary prohibition on extracting semen in vain, which Qafih quarantines as an addition by a subsequent unknown editor. Maimonides' commentary to the Mishnah likewise hints at a lenient stance.Rambam Mishna commentary to Tractate Sanhedrin 7:4 (..◊õ◊ú ◊û◊î ◊©◊®◊ï◊¶◊î ◊ú◊¢◊©◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ê◊©◊™◊ï ◊¢◊ï◊©◊î ◊ú◊§◊ô ◊©◊î◊¢◊†◊ô◊ü..◊î◊ê◊°◊ï◊® ◊ï◊î◊û◊ï◊™◊® ◊ê◊ô◊†◊ü ◊ë◊¢◊†◊ô◊ü ◊î◊û◊®◊ï◊ó◊ß ◊ï◊î◊©◊†◊ï◊ê ◊ï◊î◊û◊®◊ï◊¶◊î ◊ï◊î◊ê◊î◊ï◊ë ◊ï◊û◊î ◊©◊®◊ê◊ï◊ô ◊ú◊¢◊©◊ï◊™ ◊û◊ì◊®◊ö ◊î◊¶◊†◊ô◊¢◊ï◊™ ◊ï◊™◊õ◊ú◊ô◊™ ◊î◊§◊®◊ô◊©◊ï◊™)  On occasion  Chazal have in certain instances permitted intentional extra-vaginal ejaculation in tandem with one's wife.The tannaim Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Meir (Tosefta, Niddah 2:), for safety reasons (prior to the advent of female birth control) permits exterior ejaculation for a duration of 24 months post childbirth (Talmud Yebamoth 34). Tosefot cites the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak (Isaac ben Samuel) who permits an occasional complete anal ejaculation with one's wife on condition that one does not accustom himself to always doing so (Tosfoth, Yebamoth 34b; Tosfoth, Sanhedrin 58b). The Bayit Chadash (Yoel Sirkis) commentary to the Rabbeinu Asher (ibid.) explicitly permits this foreign ejaculation with Rabbeinu Asher siding with the Tosafist opinion.Rabbeinu Asher to Yebamoth ch. 3 This opinion is likewise quoted in Tur Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'ezer ch. 25. The Bayis Chodosh sourced his views based on the Talmudic tract of Yebamoth; Thus Rabbenu Asher, followed by Rabbi Elijah Spira, commented that an occasional anal ejaculation in tandem with one's wife is not considered \\"extracting semen in vain\\" (and not banned by the Talmud) as long as the intention is not to avoid impregnating one's wife and it is done on occasion, as this is not likened to the desire of Onan who wished to avoid impregnating Tamar entirely.\\"Eliyah rabbah\\" to ch. 240 of Orach Chayim, 10-11 The Aguddah work also sides with the lenient opinion permitting an occasional extra-vaginal ejaculation with one's wife,Agudah, p. 115 col. 2 whilst Rabbi Samuel Eidels (the Maharsha) likewise taking a lenient view.Maharsha to Talmud Nedarim 20a Parable of meat and fish In a varying text of Kallah Rabthi as printed by Rabbi Solomon Aaron Wertheimer in \\"Battei Medrashoth\\",of the Cairo geniza: http://www.hebrewbooks.org/21179 vol. 1, p. 229 Rabbi Werthheimer notes the significance of the Talmud quoting both meat and fish in its parable depicting the enhanced permissiveness of sexually gratifying activities that one may perform with his wife. Since the Torah forbids cooking one's meat in milk, a parable quoting just meat would not suffice as meat has this restrictive element whereas fish has a lesser restrictive element, thus implying that man has an enhanced level of (sexual) freedom with his wife. As often as needed A more explicit permissive stance is that of the tosafist rabbi Isaiah di Trani the Elder who hints that a complete extra- vaginal ejaculation is permitted whenever needed to \\"seat\\" one's desire with the stark exclusion being to avoid pregnancy; Rabbi Isaiah the Elder's view is likewise echoed by his descendant, Rabbi Isaiah di Trani the Younger.\\"Ria\\"z\\", Jerusalem. 1994 Rabbi Eleazar of Worms, in his recently published Torah commentary to the verse \\"Adam and his wife, and where not embarrassed\\" (Genesis) permits any activity with one's wife necessary to \\"quiet (lit. seat)\\" his desire.Rokeach to the Torah (J. Kluggman, Bnei Brak), p. 83 =Active participation= Later rabbinic authorities differentiated between masturbation (self-extracting semen in vain) and an extra-vaginal ejaculation achieved with the active participation of one's Torah-permitted partner‚Äîwith the former being forbidden under most if not all circumstances. Apparently, any halachic permit for an extra-vaginal ejaculation must be accompanied by the active participation of one's wife.

He was professor of physiology at University of Kharkiv and then at Kharkiv Medical Institute. He helped to establish the Danilevsky Institute of Endocrine Pathology Problems which he directed until his death. Danilewsky made important works in physiology, particularly in neurobiology. He was the first to give comprehensive description of nerve impulse in the brain of dogs. He also worked on the physiological responses of hypnosis in animals and humans. He was one of the pioneers in study of insulin action. However his most well known contribution is in parasitology. He was the first to investigate systematically on blood parasites of vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, and amphibians. He is the binomial authority of a number of bird parasites. His paper titled \\"About Blood Parasites (Haematozoa)\\" published in 1884 in the Russian Medicine journal is regarded as the foundation of modern parasitology in bird malaria and other protozoan infections. A species of blood parasite in bird Haemoproteus danilewskyi is named after him. Biography Danilewsky was born in Kharkiv (was under Russian Empire, now Ukraine), and was educated there. He graduated from the University of Kharkiv in 1874, and earned his doctoral degree in 1877, at the age of 25, upon the thesis Investigations into the physiology of the brain. He was professor of physiology at the University of Kharkiv during 1883 to 1909 and 1917 to 1921. From 1921 he transferred to Kharkiv Medical Institute. In 1927 the Russian Academy of Sciences established Danilevsky Institute of Endocrine Pathology Problems, which he directed until his death. Contributions Danilewsky was one of the pioneers of neurobiology. He was the first to describe the nerve impulse system in the brain of dogs. However his most notable works were in parasitology. In 1884 he was the first to observe the species of Haemoproteus, parasitic protozoan in the blood of birds, and established the order Haemospororida for it. He helped to establish a new genus Leucocytozoon (but did not give the name). He was the first to observe the genus in 1889. The first species described in 1898 was even named primarily after him as Leukocytozoen Danilewskyi. Danilewsky was the first to describe the bird malaria. He discovered the symptoms of malaria in birds such as acute anaemia, enlargement of liver and spleen, accumulation of pigments in the blood cells. He also gave the first clue to the similarity of malaria of birds to that of humans. (This idea was followed by Ronald Ross in 1898 who won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1902 for experimentally demonstrating the principle.) He identified the bird malaria parasites as \\"pseudovacules\\", and by 1885 he recognised for the first the existence of three separate genera of protozoan parasites in birds, now known as Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon. However his publication was in Russian and therefore was not accessible to outside Russia, until they were translated into French in a three-volume book La Parasitologie Compar√©e du Sang in 1889. Danilewsky described and discovered the protozoan Trypanosoma avium in 1885, the first known flagellate protozoan parasite in birds.

They settled Delray in Southwest Detroit.Woodford, p. 186. In 1898 the Michigan Malleable Iron Company began operations in Delray. Hungarian immigrants moved to Delray from cities including Cleveland Ohio; South Bend, Indiana; and Toledo, Ohio in order to get better working conditions and better wages.Beynon, p. 755. In 1905 a Hungarian Catholic church opened in Delray. The Holy Cross Hungarian Catholic Church opened by 1925. The Hungarians became one of the largest groups to settle Detroit in the early 20th century. The Delray-Springwells area served as the \\"Little Hungary\\" of Detroit and Michigan's Hungarian culture was centered in that community. In the 1950s Hungarians escaped the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, causing more to arrive in Delray. The construction of Interstate 75 in the mid-1960s destroyed large parts of Delray and divided the community into two pieces. Middle and working class Hungarians moved to Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Melvindale, and Riverview.Collum and Krueger, p. 177. Some Hungarians also moved to Taylor.\\"Popular band plays soulful music, Hungarian style.\\" The Detroit News. August 21, 2002. Retrieved on December 3, 2013.

As of 2005 the closest remaining large Little Italy near Detroit was Via Italia in Windsor, Ontario, and there was a group of remaining Italian shops and restaurants along Garfield Road in Clinton Township. In 2005 Armando Delicato, author of Italians in Detroit, wrote that \\"Unlike some other national groups, like the Poles, who still look to Hamtramck, or the Mexicans, who have Mexicantown, Italian Detroiters no longer have a geographical center\\".Delicato, p. 8. =Poles= As of 2001, the Metro Detroit area had the U.S.'s second largest Polish ethnic concentration after Chicago.Woodford, p. 185.

By 1920 the city had the largest concentration of Romanians in the Midwestern United States.Radzilowski, p. 231. After an influx of thousands Romanians into Detroit from Cleveland, Ohio, occurring from 1920 to 1926, due to automobile industry jobs, Detroit gained the largest Romanian population in the United States. A Romanian episcopate established for serving the United States was established in Detroit in 1929. By 1930 the state of Michigan had over 11,000 Romanians. As of 2005, 26,857 persons with Romanian ancestry lived in southwest Detroit. =Other White ethnic groups= As of 2001, Metro Detroit also had the U.S.'s largest concentrations of Belgians, Chaldeans, and Maltese people that year. A group of Dutch people arrived in Detroit after Henry Ford's $5 per day wage announcement. Jan Reef, a Dutch immigrant to Detroit, developed a gear process utilized by early automakers. Arthur M. Woodward, author of This is Detroit, 1701-2001, wrote that \\"the auto industry is indebted to\\" Reef. As of 1951, the Estonian newspapers distributed in Detroit were published in other cities. Those newspapers were Estonian Word, Free Estonian Word, Our Road, and Our Voice. As of that year there were no Estonian-language schools in Detroit.Mayer, p. 16. The first Finns to move to Detroit arrived to manufacture automobile bodies for the Ford Motor Company. They were previously skilled metalworkers in Massachusetts. Many Finns located in the copper country in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan moved down to Detroit after Henry Ford announced his $5 per day wage. Steve Babson, author of Working Detroit, stated that in the 1920s, women from Finnish and Hungarian houses had \\"considerably more freedom\\" compared to those from Italian and Macedonian houses.Babson, p. 45-46 Women from Hungarian and Finnish houses opened social groups for both sexes such as political, benevolent, and sports groups; women from the ethnicities often had more encouragement to attend high school and further education compared to Italians and Macedonians.Babson, p. 46 As of 1999, 25% of people in Metro Detroit stated that they had German heritage. The state of Michigan sent representatives to New York and Germany, including Bavaria, to attract German workers during the middle of the 1800s. Historically in Detroit Germans who were in the trades focused on the brewing industry. Most Germans in Detroit moved to areas along Gratiot in the east side while some moved to areas in Michigan Avenue. In a later period, many Germans resettled in Macomb County. As of 1951, there was no specific Lithuanian cemetery in Detroit.Feinstein, p. 150. In 1904, the City of Detroit had 1,300 Russians. By 1925, the number of Russians increased to 49,000. As of 1951, there were no Russian newspapers in Detroit.Mayer, p. 65. Historically, in Detroit, Scots who were in the trades focused on tool-making and practiced their trade in automobile plants. As of 1951, about 2,500 Swiss people lived throughout various areas in the City of Detroit. Swiss people began coming to Detroit before 1900 and in 1920 to 1930 the peak Swiss immigration period occurred. The Detroit Swiss Society had Swiss as members. There was no particular church for the Swiss members.Mayer, p. 72. \\"There are approximately 2,500 people of Swiss descent in the city of Detroit. They began to arrive before 1900, but their peak immigration to the city was in the period, 1920 to 1930. They are scattered throughout the city.\\" In the early 20th century, the Yugoslav American Independent Club tried to unite the Croatian, Serbian, and Slovenian groups in Detroit. Infighting between Croats and Serbs caused those efforts to fail. In the 1990s, ethnic Serbs in Sterling Heights, together with ethnic Macedonians, had the nickname \\"Yugos\\" and they often had conflicts with \\"Albos,\\" or ethnic Albanians.

Asians From 2000 to 2010, the Asian American population combined of Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties increased by 37%. As of 2010, almost half of the Asian Americans in the three county area live in Oakland County. According to Sarah Swider, a sociologist from Wayne State University who specializes in gender issues, labor relations, and immigration from Asia, the increase in the Asian population in the Detroit area is due to Asian Americans leaving traditional immigration gateway cities such as Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington DC, and settling in areas with high-tech job opportunities and lower costs of living.Steele, Micki. \\"Asian-Americans settle in Metro Detroit enclaves .\\" The Detroit News.

The Immigration Act of 1965 had increased Asian settlement into Metro Detroit, with immigrants from South Asia, China, Korea, and the Philippines. Many of the immigrants who arrived after the act were doctors, engineers, nurses, and scientists because the post-1965 immigration policies favored educated professionals.
