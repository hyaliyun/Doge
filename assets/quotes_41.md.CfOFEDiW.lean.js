The Stradale is the first road car manufactured by the company, the company's mainstream products being chassis development for other automobile manufacturers along with the development and construction of race cars. The Stradale is a barchetta in its basic form, with no doors, but is convertible to berlinetta, roadster and targa top body styles after the installation of interchangeable parts.  History and development  Rear view Company founder Gian Paolo Dallara had the desire to create a car bearing his own name after having worked with various manufacturers and overseeing their projects ranging from the development of Formula 1 and Formula 3 cars as well as Indycars and even designing the chassis of sports cars for other manufacturers, notable manufacturers include Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren and Alfa Romeo. The development of such a car was halted six times as the funds received from the completion of projects of other companies were invested in the development of other projects but finally, after accumulating enough funds for the development of a road car, the CEO of the company, Andrea Pontremoli was tasked with the development work. Development began in 2015 with design work contracted to Granstudio, a small Italian design consultancy firm located in Turin. Hours of wind tunnel testing was performed on the final mockups in order to ensure that the car was aerodynamically refined. Chassis work was undertaken by former race car driver Loris Bicocchi. Dallara had been inspired by Colin Chapman's philosophy of lightweight minimalist sports cars and the final product, the Stradale embodied those principals. With a dry weight of , the Stradale has performance comparable to high performance sports cars while being driver-focused. The first car was delivered to Dallara himself, on the occasion of his 81st birthday, at the company's headquarters in Varano de' Melegari, Italy, in 2017.  Specifications  The Stradale is powered by a 2.3-litre turbocharged Ford EcoBoost Inline-four engine also used in the Ford Focus RS. The engine is reworked by Bosch in order to generate a maximum power output of at 6,200 rpm and a peak torque of at 3,000-5,000 rpm. Bosch also worked on the car's aerodynamics and as a result, the car in the berlinetta body style is able to generate of downforce with its optional rear wing. The conversion to different body styles was made possible by a removable windscreen made from motorsport grade polycarbonate glass and a carbon fibre frame. The windscreen has a shape and a central windscreen wiper reminiscent of the Group C race cars of the 1990s. A T-shape removable frame combined with detachable gull-wing doors makes the conversion to a Targa top and Berlinetta bodyshell possible, but the driver enters the car in the same way, regardless of body structure (i.e by climbing over the side). The base of the chassis is a hollow carbon-fibre tub with a solid carbon fibre side structure in order to channel air to the rear of the car. The air from one side goes to the engine while the air from the other side goes to the air-to-air intercooler. The carbon tub is joined by aluminium sub-structures front and aft. Two control arms are present at each corner, with the front arms directly mounted on the tub. The floor of the chassis is flat with a front splitter mounted at the front and a rear diffuser mounted at the rear. These elements combined without the optional rear wing create so much downforce that the format of the car requires to be fitted with reverse Gurney flaps that help maintain appropriate aerodynamic balance. The engine is transversely mounted and is combined with a 6-speed manual transmission (also from the Focus RS) or an optional 6-speed automated manual transmission with paddle-shifters mounted on the steering column transferring the power of the engine to the rear wheels. Both of the transmissions come with a Quaife limited-slip differential. The Stradale comes with electronic stability control as standard that can be turned off and set to intervene as minimum as possible. The braking system utilises steel brake discs as the engineers working on the car believed that steel brake discs worked just as good without the added complexity and cost of a carbon-ceramic brake disc. The brake calipers are supplied by Brembo. The interior of the car has carbon fibre as its main element and has all of the main controls of the car integrated into the steering wheel. Vital information of the car such as speed and rpm are displayed on a motorsports-style display screen on the steering column. The seats are carbon-fibre shells fixed to the chassis and have foam padding applied on them. The steering column and paddles are adjustable in order to alter the driving position. Minimal luggage can be stowed in two compartments located behind the engine and two additional compartments in the seats are designed to store two race helmets. The total space of these compartments is four cubic feet. Other features of the car include Pirelli Trofeo R tyres, active racing suspension system by Tractive suspension which drops the car's ride height by 0.8-inches in track mode and an oil pressure accumulator enabling the fuel pump to withstand the 2.0 g of lateral acceleration the chassis is capable of generating.  Performance  The Stradale can generate a downforce of at in its basic form and with its optional rear wing. The car accelerates from in 3.2 seconds, in 8.1 seconds, can complete a quarter-mile in 11.4 seconds and can attain a top speed of .  Production  The company plans to produce no more than 600 units of the Stradale in five years offering a limited number of units for sale every year. Each car has a cost of ‚Ç¨191,000 (US$236,000) before taxes.

Two of the burial mounds at the site were designated as a National Historic Site of Japan in 1934, and the objects uncovered during archaeological investigations are designated as Important Cultural Properties of Takaoka City. Overview The group of kofun was constructed on the margin of a hill overlooking Toyama Bay in northwestern Toyama Prefecture. The site consisted of a keyhole-shaped tumuli (No.1) and a scallop-shaped tumuli (No.2) and ten or more smaller dome-shaped tumuli and were discovered in 1918 when a tree was being planted at a local Shinto shrine. Tombs No.1 and No.2 have not been surveyed internally in detail, but are presumed to date from the beginning of the fifth century in the late Kofun period. These two tombs were protected as a National Historic Site since 1934; however, the remaining tombs were destroyed when the area was developed for agricultural land after World War II. Tomb No.1 has a total length of 62 meters, with a 35 meter diameter x 7 meter high round portion and 30 meter wide rectangular portion with height of 5.45 meters. Tomb No.2 has a total length of 50 meters and diameter of 33 meters with a height of 6 meters. It was found to contain a bronze mirror, stone tolls and cylindrical beads. Despite the protected status, a portion of Tomb No.2 was destroyed during the construction of a prefectural highway from 1976-1977, during which time a stone sarcophagus and numerous grave goods were discovered.

The castle was built during the Sassanid Empire (224 to 651 AD) and functioned as fortified walled city on the ancient Silk Road that ran through central Iran. Izadkhast was the first castle in the world made from adobe. And it is the second largest adobe building in the world after Arg-e Bam. The castle is built on a high bedrock overlooking the Izadkhast valley. Inside the castle walls are many narrow alleyways and passages criss-crossing through centuries old tiny houses and buildings. The castle and surrounding Izadkhast complex has been nominated to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on August 9, 2007 in the Cultural category.The Complex of Izadkhast - UNESCO World Heritage Centre Accessed 2018-09-23  Location  1920s artwork of Izadkhvast CastleThe Izad-khast castle is located on the ancient Silk Road between Shiraz and Isfahan. The site is in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by a desert land. But a high singular bedrock overlooking a valley was an ideal location for the development of a fortified desert city in the middle of nowhere. The Izadkhvast castle is built on this singular bedrock that juts out to the Izadkhast valley. The valley around it functions as a natural deep trench. Castle fortification walls have been built around the bedrock, tall and almost perpendicular, ranging from 6 to 15 meters on three sides. On the fourth and shorter side of the bedrock, a 30 meter (100 feet) long trench had been dug. The trench is 4 meters across and 4 meters deep. Access to the castle was over the trench, through a small bridge and a gate. Entrance of the big castle over the trench.The site's natural topography and added fortifications made the castle one of the most unattainable buildings of the ancient times for robbers and enemies. On the valley below the castle bedrock are rocky fields, with a barren plateau behind. The Izadkhast caravanserai roadside inn stands alone in this valley, in the middle of a rocky field.  History  The history of the castle complex dates back to the pre-Islamic era of Iran. Izad-Khast is a Sassanid castle, built during the Sassanid Empire (224 to 651 AD) which ruled Persia (Iran) and many parts of the surrounding countries. It was then used, added and improved on until Qajars era (1794 to 1925). This has left works inside the castle belonging to different periods from Sassanids to Qajars with different architectural styles. The fire temple of Izad Khast Castle from the Sassanid era was turned into a mosque after the advent of Islam to Iran. The castle and complex is now completely abandon. However until the turn of the millennium there were still people living in the old quarters of Izadkhast. Floods in recent years destroyed many homes and forced people to move from this isolated, ancient desert citadel.  Architecture  View of Izadkhast Caravanserai from castle.In location and form of construction the castle display unique characteristics. However the material wise its comparable to the Citadel of Bam, Rayen and other sites nearby in Yazd and Kerman provinces. The architecture of Izadkhast castle is very similar to the more feted Citadel of Bam. The Izad-Khast castle like the Citadel of Bam is a sand construction, made of adobe. The castle is a Sassanid (224 to 651 AD) structure, but the interior has seen modifications and new structures added later on. Structures like a mosque and a bathroom are later additions. Most of the homes in the castle interior are built from wood and mud. Size limitations of the bedrock led to an agglomeration of smaller rooms and increase of floors. Some of the buildings inside the castle rose as high as five storeys. It is impressive in itself but becomes a remarkable architectural achievement considering the circumstances of its time. The Izadkhast Caravanserai was built during the Safavid Dynasty era (1502 - 1736). Threats Crumbling ruins of the old castle townMany parts of the Izadkhast castle are crumbling due to erosion and flooding. Many homes even beside the castle front gate have been completely destroyed. The castle is also in danger from treasure hunters and vandalism. Inside the walled city, there are signs of damage from treasure hunters and graffiti on the walls.

In 1949, she became the second woman in Denmark to serve as a high court judge, following in the footsteps of Ragnhild Fabricius Gjellerup. She was particularly active in dealing with property cases resulting from the Second World War. Johnsen also supported women's interests, serving on the board of the Danish Women's Society for almost 20 years. In 1952, she represented Denmark at the UNESCO conference in Paris. Biography Born in Copenhagen on 9 September 1899, Karen Emilie Johnsen was the daughter of the lawyer George Johnsen (1871‚Äì1935) and Emilie Vilhelmine Marie Gr√∏nqvist (1871‚Äì1937). After matriculating from N. Zahle's School in 1918, encouraged by her father, she studied law at the University of Copenhagen, graduating in 1924. For her thesis on family law, she became the first woman ever to be awarded the university's gold medal. In view of the limited opportunities for women lawyers at the time, Johnsen began her career with an unpaid job at the Diocese of Copenhagen. After helping her father for a short period, in 1925 she was employed as a secretary in Copenhagen's municipal court. She was promoted to the rank of proxy judge in 1935 and to municipal judge in 1939, the first women to reach the position. From 1949 until her retirement in 1966, she was a judge for the √òstre Landsret, one of Denmark's two high courts. She was involved in a number of large post-war cases, some of which ended in the death penalty, which she accepted against her will as a necessity of the times. She was also active in advancing equal legal treatment of children, whether born in or out of matrimony. She also achieved more equitable treatment of prostitutes, bringing cases under social rather than penal legislation. Johnsen was also active in the women's movement, becoming a board member of the Danish Women's Society (1930‚Äì49) and of Kvindelige Akademikere (Female Academics), a society for university women (1938‚Äì48). Given her interest in education, in 1953, she represented Denmark at the UNESCO conference in Paris. After she retired in 1966, she left her legal interests behind, spending the rest of her life with her childhood friend and long- standing companion Zenia K√ºhn (1898‚Äì1985). Together they were engaged in travelling, reading and visiting art exhibitions. Karen Johnsen died in Virum, just north of Copenhagen, on 17 November 1980. Awards In 1951, Johnsen was one of the first women to be honoured with the Order of the Dannebrog. In 1954, she became a First Class Knight, in 1966 a Commander.

Evidence from core samples around the seamount, the appearance of the summit area, and the presence of thin manganese crusts imply an age of about 10,000 years for some volcanic rocks at Shimada; the rocks are too young to be dated by potassium- argon dating, and all the evidence indicates that volcanic activity at Shimada is of late Quaternary-Holocene age.

Platform of the former Erfurt Berliner Stra√üe stop in 2010.

Oktober 1979 - 30 Jahre DDR in Daten und Ereignissen bei der Deutschen Reichsbahn, Eisenbahn-Jahrbuch 1979, Transpress, nachgedruckt in: Horst Regling (Hrsg.), Schienenverkehr in der DDR, Band III, transpress, Stuttgart, 2002, In the Kursbuch tables of Deutsche Reichsbahn, the terms \\"S-Bahn\\" or \\"S-Bahn-Tarif\\" were not used for this line.Kursbuch der Deutschen Reichsbahn, Binnenverkehr, Sommerfahrplan 1980Kursbuch der Deutschen Reichsbahn, Binnenverkehr, Jahresfahrplan 1989/90 Riethschleuder was another colloquial term for the connection. Route description Starting at Erfurt Hauptbahnhof, the line ran in a semicircle north and east around the city centre. It used the route of the Wolkramshausen-Erfurt railway line as far as Erfurt Nord station. There it branched off to the west and, using the route of the former Erfurt‚ÄìNottleben light railway, developed the new development areas in the north of Erfurt. The four stations served were the stations Erfurt Hauptbahnhof and Erfurt Nord which still exist today, the former stop Erfurt Gy√∂rer Stra√üe and the former terminal Erfurt Berliner Stra√üe station. The journey time over the entire route was 13 to 14 minutes. Operation and history The construction of the new Rieth development area in the north of the city of Erfurt made it necessary to connect this part of the city to the city centre. The existing Erfurt tramway and the supplementary bus lines offered by the Erfurt public transport companies (Erfurter Verkehrsbetriebe) were no longer able to meet the growing demand for transport at peak times. Since the track of the former small railway to Nottleben ran directly through the residential area, a plan was drawn up to set up a railway connection between the north of the city and Erfurt's main railway station (Hauptbahnhof) in order to relieve the urban local traffic. Since all the tracks were already in place, only two new stations had to be built. Thus, the connection could be opened on 13 May 1976 after a construction period of only three months. The line length was 8.6 kilometres, of which 2.7 kilometres were on the line of the former light railway. In the Kursbuch of Deutsche Reichsbahn, the line was listed under route number 642. There was no interval timetable. The trains operated only during the rush hours. On working days, eight (1985) or nine (1990) train pairs commuted on the line. Half of the trains only travelled to or from Erfurt Nord. There were connections to trains in the direction of Erfurt Hauptbahnhof. On Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, traffic was suspended. The only characteristic of the S-Bahn was its independent tariff. Instead of the kilometre tariff generally used by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, a flat-rate tariff was applied. Single tickets were sold in advance at a price of 0.20 Marks. They had to be validated before boarding the trains on the platform. They were sold at Erfurt Hauptbahnhof and Erfurt Nord stations. However, the special fare was abolished shortly after German reunification, i.e. before the line was discontinued. After the political changes of 1989 and 1990, the transport needs of the population changed. In particular, traffic peaks in rush hour traffic were distorted. Since the travel times by tram to the main station were similarly long and significantly shorter in the direction of the city centre, a separate train connection became superfluous. The connection was thinned out and completely closed in May 1995. Finally, two pairs of trains operated a day. In 2003, the Erfurt Nord-Erfurt-Marbach line was shut down by the Eisenbahnbundesamt.Liste der seit 1994 stillgelegten bundeseigenen Strecken im Land Th√ºringen beim Eisenbahn-Bundesamt. The renovation of the Mittelh√§user Kreuz in 2012 meant that the Mittelh√§user Stra√üe was renovated a bit and the track of the former railway crossing was removed.Birgit Kummer: Stra√üe der Nationen noch bis zum 5. Dezember Baustelle. In: Th√ºringer Allgemeine Zeitung, Lokalteil Erfurt, 2. November 2011. In preparation for the Bundesgartenschau 2021 in Erfurt, the idea was born in 2015 to revive the route in order to bring visitors from Erfurt Hauptbahnhof to the Geraaue. Alternative ideas would be a cycle path or the use as a trolley route.Frank Karmeyer: ‚ÄûRiethschleuder‚Äú lebt als Buga-Idee wieder auf. In: Th√ºringische Landeszeitung, Lokalteil Erfurt, 31. Juli 2015. Vehicles Double-decker reversing trains pulled by locomotives of DR class 110 series (from 1992: DR class 202 series) were used. This meant that it was not necessary to build a transfer track at the end of the line. Literature *G√ºnther Barthel: Die Geschichte der Kleinbahn Erfurt (West)‚ÄìNottleben. 1.

It fought in World War II as the 15th Motorized Infantry Division, under the command of Alphonse Juin, surrendering during the Battle of France. Reestablished on 1 March 1951, it was disbanded in 1962. The division was reformed again during the French Army reorganization of 1977. In the 1980s it was part of the 2nd Army Corps;NATO Order of Battle 1989 (p. 93) it was shifted into the 3rd Army Corps after the 2nd Army Corps was disestablished, and finally disbanded in 1994.  World War I  It was commanded by General L√©on Bajolle upon mobilization. General Gaston d'Armau de Pouydraguin became commander on 14 October 1914. General Ferdinand Blazer was appointed commander on 24 March 1915, General Fran√ßois Collas on 15 July of that year, and General Louis Achille Arbanere on 9 March 1917. The division was assigned to the 8th Army Corps for the duration of the war. It included the 29th Brigade with the 56th and 134th Infantry Regiments and the 30th Brigade with the 10th and 27th Infantry Regiments. Organic artillery support was provided by the 48th Field Artillery Regiment with three groupes of 75mm guns, while reconnaissance was provided by a cavalry squadron of the 16th Chasseur Regiment; in November 1915 it transferred to the 73rd Infantry Division. In January 1917, the 27th Regiment was transferred to the 16th Infantry Division. At the same time the division was reorganized to form a triangular structure, eliminating the brigade headquarters to include the 10th, 56th, and 134th Infantry Regiments, and was again assigned two squadrons from the 16th Chasseurs. In August 1918, the pioneer battalion of the 106th Reserve Infantry Regiment was attached to the division after being transferred from the 20th Army Corps.  Interwar period  The 15th Motorized Infantry Division, a unit of the Northeast type, was stationed at Dijon during the interwar period. It included the 4th, 27th, and 134th Infantry Regiments, the 4th Infantry Division Reconnaissance Group with armored cars (), the 1st Motorized Divisional Artillery Regiment, the 201st Motorized Divisional Light Artillery Regiment with two groups of 155mm howitzers, in addition to smaller support units.  World War II  = Mobilization and Phoney War = On 23 August 1939, when the French Army began its mobilization for World War II, the division was at the disposal of the Minister of Defense and its first echelon was alerted in the 8th Military Region. Under the mobilization plan it was located in the area of Gray, under the command of G√©n√©ral de division Henri Parisot from 2 September. The second echelon arrived on 26 August, when the division was assigned to the covering reserve in the 8th Army sector. On 5 September it was transferred by road to the area southwest of Sarrebourg, with headquarters in Blamont as part of the 5th Army. Three days later the division headquarters relocated east to Lemberg when it became part of the 8th Army Corps of the 5th Army. Between 9 and 12 September the division advanced into the Ohrenthal (part of Rolbing) salient with the 23rd Infantry Division of the 5th Army Corps of the 4th Army on the left and the 4th Colonial Infantry Division of its corps on the right in front of the Maginot Line as part of the Saar Offensive, with its headquarters at Schorbach. This advance, which became known as the Saar Offensive, resulted in the division occupying positions from the German border at Hornbach to the outskirts of Stausteinerwald, west of the Fortified Sector of Rohrbach, on 13 September. As the French units began retreating towards the Maginot Line, the division sector was modified to run from Height 326 west of Hornbach to Height 354 west of Riedelberg between 24 and 25 September. Relieved by the 35th Infantry Division in its left sector and the 3rd Colonial Infantry Division in its right sector between 2 and 3 October, the division retreated behind the Maginot Line. It reconcentrated in the area of Baerenthal on 4 October. Transferred to the 5th Army reserve with headquarters at Bouxwiller on 9 October, the 15e DIM moved by road to the area of Sarrebourg and Cirey on the next day, where it became part of the reserve of the 2nd Army Group with headquarters at the latter. It was further moved by rail and road to the area of Chauny, Guiscard, Ham, and Coucy for rest, reorganization, and training on 23 October. There, it was placed in the reserve of the Grand Quartier G√©n√©ral while headquartered at Chauny, where it spent the rest of the Phoney War. G√©n√©ral de division Alphonse Juin became division commander on 1 December. = Battle of Belgium = When the German invasion of Belgium began on 10 May 1940, the division was alerted for movement into Belgium under the Dyle Plan. Assigned to the 4th Army Corps of the 1st Army, the 15e DIM recalled the 27th Infantry Regiment, which was at Sissonne on maneuvers. The 134th Infantry Regiment was sent ahead to Saint- Quentin, while the 4e GRDI was detached to the corps headquarters as part of Groupement Arlabosse, led by its commander. On the next day the division moved by road from Chauny to Gembloux through Tergnier, Saint-Quentin, Le Cateau, Binche, La Louvi√®re, Gosselies, and Tongrinne, setting up its headquarters at Tongrinne. The 4th and 134th Infantry Regiments began moving into positions on 12 May, with a battalion from each regiment occupying the sector of the 1st Moroccan Division, which had not yet arrived, from Ernage to the northern part of Gembloux. Groupement Arlabosse was briefly transferred back to the division that day but again detached to the 1st Moroccan Division at noon. The 27th Infantry Regiment arrived at the division positions on 13 May and at the end of that day the division was relieved by the newly arrived 1st Moroccan Division. Its positions shifted to a sector between the 1st Moroccan Division on the southern edge of Gembloux and the 12th Motorized Infantry Division at Beuzet; the 134th Infantry held the northernmost part of the line, the 27th Infantry the middle, and the 4th Infantry the southernmost. At noon on the same day the 4e GRDI was placed under direct corps command between Geest and Noville to the north of Grande-Rosi√©re. The division engaged German forces along its front on 14 May, while being forced to retreat in what became known as the Battle of Gembloux. Its artillery targeted German tank concentrations in the area of Grandleez and Baudeset in support of the 1st Moroccan Division. German tank attacks were repulsed by the 27th Infantry Regiment to the south of Gembloux and the 4th Infantry Regiment at Beuzet on 15 May. On that day the 13e Battalion de Chars de Combat with Hotchkiss H35 light tanks of 515e Groupe de battalions de Chars de Combat was attached to the division, while the 1st Battalion of the 27th Infantry Regiment was detached to Groupement Bougrain. During the night it retreated under orders by rail to Wavre and Charleroi. The division headquarters shifted to Thim√©on on 16 May, when it held defensive positions on the line of Brye, Saint-Amand, and Fleurus. The 4th and 27th Infantry Regiments repulsed German tank attacks, and retreated under orders covered by the 134th Infantry Regiment to a bridgehead at Luttre on the Charleroi Canal from Seneffe to Godarville where it relieved elements of the corps. Juin was captured with much of the division at Lille on 29 May 1940.  Cold War  The 15th Infantry Division was reestablished on 1 March 1951, and disbanded on 1 July 1962. The division was again reestablished during the 1977 reorganization of the French Army, with its headquarters at Limoges as part of the Strategic Reserve. In event of war, elements of it would be used as cadres for the reserve 115th Infantry Division. Under the 1983 reorganization of the French Army, the division was assigned to the 2nd Army Corps. Before its disbandment the division became part of the 3rd Army Corps.http://www.tanaka- world.net/?cat=7&annee;=1990 G√©n√©ral de brigade M. Zeisser (Michel, Maurice) was named commander of the division and of the 43e division militaire territoriale in 1991.

As part of the reduction in the strength of the French Army during the 1990s after the end of the Cold War, the division was disbanded in a process concluding in 1994. Elements of the division were merged into the 27th Alpine Division to form the 27th Mountain Infantry Division on 1 July of that year.

It was designed by William Hardy Wilson and built from 1912 to 1913. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The real spirit of the 20th century came to Australian architecture with the domestic work of a quartet of practitioners after the World War I. Between them they encompassed all the virtues and the vices, the strengths and the weaknesses which have marked the last 50 years. The only thing they had in common was a conviction that architectural thinking had to start at a more basic level than anything that had been known for a hundred years. The group of thinking-architects responsible for ushering in the 20th century were William Hardy Wilson, Robin Dods, Harold Desbrowe-Annear and Walter Burley Griffin. They worked in different places and they worked individually. But between them they covered most of the ideas and attitudes that followed. Because, with the exception of Griffin, they worked almost exclusively on houses, their effect was strongest on domestic work. The same depth of thought and changes which they brought to homes did not begin to percolate into other types of building, which merely acquired from them the vices of individualism to compound their blatant stylism, for another 40 years. William (later Hardy) Wilson had been born in Sydney in 1881. His search for architectural truth, a deep love and appreciation of beauty, an interest in history and an abiding faith in the concept of the artist- architect led him to strive for the pre-Victorian virtues. But his was not mere copyism. Sensitive to the underlying qualities of colonial architecture, he sought to apply their timeless principles to his own work. In 1905 Wilson went to England and enrolled in the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London and also worked a draftsman for William Flockhart in Bond Street. The chief draftsman in that office, Leonard Rothrie, introduced him to the Chelsea Art Club, where he met English sculptor Francis Derwent Ward and Scottish painter George Henry, as well as Australian artists including Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton and George Lambert. In 1908 Wilson and Stacy Neave (another architect from Sydney) commenced their grand tour of Europe and North America, where they found the work of McKim, Mead & White and the American Colonial Revival style particularly impressive. It was during this tour that Wilson realised the influence of geography was crucial to the development of art and architecture. In 1911 Wilson changed his name legally to William Hardy Wilson and joined Neave to form Wilson & Neave. When Neave served in World War I, Wilson closed the practice and concentrated on writing and completing his drawings of old colonial architecture in NSW and Tasmania and building his own house, Purulia. In 1912 he built, after years of thought, his own home, Purulia, at Wahroonga, a suburb to the north of the Sydney central business district. Designed for servantless living, the house was a simple rectangle in plan with plain plastered walls painted white, a low- pitched roof covered in multi-coloured shingle tiles and with boxed eaves. The windows, simple rectangles with Georgian sashes and louvered shutters, were protected by striped canvas awnings. At a time when Queen Anne (revival) was riding high and in an area with pretensions to being the elite suburb of Sydney, its barrenness brought a deputation from outraged neighbours who claimed the values of their properties would be undermined. Wilson could not be stopped. When it was finished he had created a home of honesty, simplicity, sincerity and integrity. Wilson claimed it was not a masterpiece. But it was his. He never produced anything better and its influence was widespread. It became a prototype for all North Shore homes and, to the next generation, the epitome of respectability.Freeland, 1988, 236-8. Anticipating the changing domestic situation, he planned Purulia as a \\"maidless flat\\" and made the kitchen a pleasant family room. Overall, the house was very modern for its time. Describing the building of Purulia, he (Wilson) wrote: 'It is a rectangular cottage covered with an unbroken hipped roof. As the walls arose square, bleak and factory like, consternation filled the souls of neighbours dwelling in multi-angular villas. By the time the brickwork was finished their indignation could not be contained....I found an artist making shingle tiles and from him secured curved uneven, overburnt and many coloured rejects from myriads of flawless tiles. The roof of Purulia is like a venerable Persian rug of quiet and glowing colour.' Today the style of Purulia has become quite a prototype of Sydney's north shore. Features include well proportioned rooms and windows, the typical Wilson use of stone and whitewashed walls, louvred shutters, the colonnaded facade of the garage, the summer house, the brass door step and the general utility of the house and garden.National Trust, 1976. In seeking out and drawing the buildings for his \\"Old Colonial Architecture in New South Wales and Tasmania\\", Hardy Wilson became aware of the siting and gardens of early colonial houses. He was the first to recognise and appreciate a characteristic mid-19th century style of gardening in New South Wales. For nearly 50 years his was the only voice stressing its importance and his descriptions - as vivid and full blown as the late summer gardens he visited - are still the most evocative. Wilson looked at these gardens with a painter's eye, not the analytical eye of a designer. He was neither botanist not horticulturist. He appreciated their siting, colour and texture rather than their layout and details. Of large forest trees he admired only the picturesque angophora (A.floribunda or A.subvelutina), the \\"apple oak\\" of the colonists; and, presumably the turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera) which he planted along the rear boundaries of Purulia. He designed 5 gardens: Eryldene (Gordon), Purulia, Macquarie Cottage (Pymble), a garden for \\"An Ideal Australian Home\\" and for a \\"Standard Cottage\\" for the William Moore Trust at Gordon. The latter were not carried out. Purulia and Macquarie Cottage have been altered. Eryldene presents a problem as in its final form it displays so much the taste and horticultural expertise of its owner, Professor Waterhouse, that Wilson's contribution is difficult to assess, and since it predates the other gardens, the influence of \\"Professor Pymble\\" on these should be considered. The similarities between all Wilson's garden plans are marked. From his love and knowledge of colonial gardens came his choice of plants. The range is limited, but it contrasts with the ubiquitous palms, brush box and hybrid roses of contemporary gardens as stringkingly as his unbroken colour- washed walls contrasted with the redness of his neighbours' \\"multangular villas\\". Wilson wrote: Wilson planned his gardens with layouts of an easy, but nevertheless rigorously applied formal geometry, which owes little to colonial or contemporary English garden design (to which Wilson makes no reference in any of his writings). They are unmistakably gardens designed by an architect who, though admiring the architectural work of Lutyens, probably knew little of current English gardens. This geometry ... reached its extreme in his own house, Purulia, where the rectangular bungalow is centred in a circle of citrus trees, a conceit which can only be appreciated fully in plan form. Upon this circle Wilson playfully constructs an elaborate network of arcial and radial paths, cross paths and further circles. The geometry is complex but not forced and the architectural detailing is deliberately simple - flagged paths and summer houses with columns of whitewashed tree trunks. Behind the house an apsidal planting of fruiting olives surrounds a sundial on the central axis and screens a semi-annular kitchen and fruit garden. The positioning of the summer house at Purulia, on the cross-axis of the central path and diagonally to the right of the front door, is similar to the positioning of the more sophistocated one at Eryldene. The simple stone-flagged central path is common to all the gardens, yet it is a cottage detail, not found in the old colonial gardens of the County of Cumberland which Wilson knew.Broadbent, in National Trust of Australia (NSW), 1980, 65-70. Another notable Wilson designed house of this era was Macquarie Cottage, Pymble (1919) for H. Dunstan Vane.Edwards, 2013. In 1920 Wilson & Neave took on John Berry as partner, becoming Wilson, Neave & Berry (1920‚Äì27), a firm noted for the Colonial Revival style of architecture for domestic design: fat, low-squatting Georgian boxes with colonnaded verandahs, spider-web fanlights on entrance doors and multi-paned windows with shutters. The firms style followed the Colonial Revival based on the United States idiom, but also looked to Australian colonial architecture for inspiration. This style became very popular in the 1920s. In 1921 Wilson went to China and took lessons in Chinese painting under Kungpah King (Jin Chen); his travels to China's major cities, Peking (Beijing), Hangzhou, Shanghai, Canton (Guangshou) and Macao had a profound influence in his architectural philosophy and design. After Wilson's visit to China in 1921, the firm incorporated Oriental motifs and details, examples of which are found at Eryldene, Gordon (1914‚Äì36) and Peapes Department Store, Sydney (1923). In 1922 Wilson sold Purulia and travelled to England and Europe, where, in Vienna, he supervised the collotype reproductions for \\"Colonial architeture in NSW and Tasmania\\" (1924), his publication that would foster great interest in an Australian Colonial Revival. In 1925 Wilson returned to Sydney, where he became disillusioned with the state of Australian architecture and began writing his view sand ideas in a fictionalised biography \\"The dawn of a new civilisation\\" (1929) under a pseudonym of Richard Le Mesurer. In 1927 he completed his last design - the tennis pavilion (later called the Tea House) at Eryldene in Gordon for Prof. E. G. and Janet Waterhouse - the epitome of \\"a new style in architecture, the development in one style of Chinese and European classic\\", retired from practice and left for England.  Description  =Garden= The design of Purulia and its garden were closely integrated by Hardy Wilson. The garden design is based on a formal geometry which rises out of the rectangular form of the house. Many of the trees planted by Wilson remain as do the original sandstone flagged path and the octagonal summerhouse. A garage to one side of the front garden was added at a later date and features a colonnaded facade that is most sympathetic to the design of the house and garden. A fine sandstone wall with timber gates defines the street boundary of the property.Branch Manager's report 180/81, 21/5/1981 Of large forest trees he admired only the picturesque angophora (A.floribunda or A.subvelutina), the \\"apple oak\\" of the colonists; and, presumably the turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera) which he planted along the rear boundaries of Purulia. He designed five gardens: Eryldene (Gordon), Purulia, Macquarie Cottage (Pymble), a garden for \\"An Ideal Australian Home\\" and for a \\"Standard Cottage\\" for the William Moore Trust at Gordon.

The range is limited, but it contrasts with the ubiquitous palms, brush box and hybrid roses of contemporary gardens as stringkingly as his unbroken colour-washed walls contrasted with the redness of his neighbours' \\"multangular villas\\". 'Around the boundaries of Purulia', Wilson wrote, 'there are oleanders (Nerium oleander) red and white. Between the oleanders and the northern front there are perpendicular poplars (Lombardy poplar, (Populus nigra 'Italica')) to balance the horizontal lines of the building. On the southern side the distant city will be framed through olives (Olea europaea) grown grey, twisted and fruitful. In a wide circle around the house there are oranges (Citrus aurantium) and mandarins (C.reticulata). Camellias are slowly opening dark glossy leaves before the wall spaces. Beside the stone flagged path bordered with box (Buxus sempervirens), that leads from gate to door, there are fragrant shrubs, diosma (Coleonema pulchrum), lemon verbena (Lippia citriodora), lavenders (Lavandula spp.).' Wilson planned his gardens with layouts of an easy, but nevertheless rigorously applied formal geometry, which owes little to colonial or contemporary English garden design (to which Wilson makes no reference in any of his writings). They are unmistakably gardens designed by an architect who, though admiring the architectural work of Lutyens, probably knew little of current English gardens.

The simple stone-flagged central path is common to all the gardens, yet it is a cottage detail, not found in the old colonial gardens of the County of Cumberland which Wilson knew. The garden has some fine trees planted by Wilson - ginkgos, weeping elms and maples, copper beeches, dogwoods and citrus trees. =House= Designed for servantless living, the house was a simple rectangle in plan with plain plastered walls painted white, a low-pitched roof covered in multi-coloured shingle tiles and with boxed eaves.

A garage to one side of the front garden was added at a later date and features a colonnaded fa√ßade that is most sympathetic to the design of the house and garden.  Heritage listing  As at 12 June 2007, Purulia is a house and garden designed by one of our most outstanding architects. It is reputed to be William Hardy Wilson's best work. The influence of this house was widespread and it became a prototype for many North Shore homes. It is also rare as a garden (one of only 5) designed by Hardy Wilson, albeit altered.Broadbent, 1980, modified Read, S., 6/2007 The name Purulia should mean much to architects in Australia, for it was the home of William Hardy Wilson, who has done so much to make Australia conscious of the heritage of fine architecture she possesses. The houses he built and the books he wrote are lessons in good design. His book \\"Colonial Architecture in NSW & Tasmania\\" is known all over the world for its fine drawings and the beautiful buildings illustrated therein. He was a pioneer, for his work was revolutionary in a period which favoured a medley of unnecessarily elaborate styles. A good example of the opposition he encountered was a deputation to the local Council when Purulia was being built to have it condemned as an unsightly building.Beiers, 1948, 47. At a time when Queen Anne (revival) was riding high and in an area with pretensions to being the elite suburb of Sydney, its barrenness brought a deputation from outraged neighbours who claimed the values of their properties would be undermined. Wilson could not be stopped. When it was finished he had created a home of honesty, simplicity, sincerity and integrity. Wilson claimed it was not a masterpiece. But it was his. He never produced anything better and its influence was widespread. It became a prototype for all North Shore homes and, to the next generation, the epitome of respectability. A house and garden built by one of our most outstanding architects. The garden has some fine trees planted by Wilson - ginkgos, weeping elms and maples, copper beeches, dogwoods and citrus trees.

Except for the final kilometre between the border and G√∂rlitz station, the line is operated by PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe as route no. 278, and the corresponding timetable (SRJP) has no. 260.  History  The construction of the railway line started on 31 July 1845 when the station was built in Kohlfurt (nowadays Wƒôgliniec), attracting a large number of railway employees into what used to be a small village. The single-track railway line was finished by 26 August 1847, and on 1 September, the opening ceremonies were held. The purpose of the line was to connect the Berlin‚ÄìWroc≈Çaw railway to the G√∂rlitz‚ÄìDresden railway, and the latter was formally opened on the same day, 1 September 1847. Later in the 1860s, the Silesian Mountain Railway was built, branching off at Zgorzelec railway station (then called Moys bei G√∂rlitz) via Wa≈Çbrzych (Waldenburg-Dittersbach) to Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau); in the same decade, the Wƒôgliniec‚ÄìG√∂rlitz railway was converted to double-track. In 1860s and 1870s, the village of Kohlfurt evolved into a major railway hub: the branch line to Luba≈Ñ (then Lauban) on the Silesian Mountain Railway opened in 1865, and the Wƒôgliniec‚ÄìRo√ülau railway reached Wƒôgliniec (then Kohlfurt) in 1874. At this time, railway employees made up the majority of the village's population. The 2 km long section between Zgorzelec railway station (Moys bei G√∂rlitz) and G√∂rlitz station was electrified in 1923, with the electric traction in operation since 1 September 1923. The overhead lines were badly damaged in February 1945, and have not yet been restored. In 1948, Polish State Railways constructed a bypass to allow traffic between Wƒôgliniec and Luba≈Ñ without having to reverse at Zgorzelec railway station. At this time, the new Zgorzelec Miasto railway station was built, so that the trains using the bypass could still serve the town of Zgorzelec. On 24 November 2017, the Polish infrastructure operator PKP PLK signed a contract for the electrification of the Wƒôgliniec‚ÄìZgorzelec railway. The work is expected to be completed in 2020, at the cost of around 70 million z≈Çoty (16.3 million euro), out of which, 85% are financed by the EU infrastructure fund.  Train services  Since 2009, with an interruption between February and December 2015, three daily Regional-Express trains run on the Wƒôgliniec‚ÄìG√∂rlitz railway, on service between Wroc≈Çaw G≈Ç√≥wny railway station and Dresden Hauptbahnhof. Additionally, Koleje Dolno≈õlƒÖskie run eleven weekday trains on route 278 (Wƒôgliniec‚ÄìZgorzelec) in each direction, as well as two daily trains between Wƒôgliniec and Luba≈Ñ which bypass Zgorzelec railway station.

He was sentenced to death for several rapes of young boys, two of which ended in fatalities. Later, in connection with the moratorium on the death penalty imposed by Boris Yeltsin, the verdict was replaced by life imprisonment.  Biography  Irtyshov was born on August 16, 1971 in the Krasnodar Krai. He grew up in a dysfunctional family, with both his mother and father being alcoholics. When he was 10 he got into a car accident and got a serious craniocerebral injury as a result. He did not recover from the consequences: he was diagnosed with \\"an intellectual disability in the degree of moderate debility\\", after which his mother sent him to a special boarding school, in which Irtyshov was raped. After the boarding school he graduated from a vocational school. In 1993 he moved to St. Petersburg, where he got a job as a dishwasher at the \\"Pegasus\\" coffeehouse, but his main source of income was homosexual prostitution. The clients were popular for their sadistic inclinations, and hysteria, egocentrism and cowardice were highlighted. Igor did not consider himself a homosexual, as he also had sex with women.  Crimes  Irtyshov began his crimes in December 1993. While he was walking through the territory of the Sosnovsky Park, he noticed two brothers, 11 and 12 years old respectively. Threatening them with a knife, the criminal took the children to a quiet, secluded place where he raped them, forcing them to drink something from a jar beforehand. As the boys later said, \\"the liquid had a strange taste and an unpleasant smell.\\" Both victims received serious bodily injuries. The next attack occurred in the Kolpinsky District of St. Petersburg. While violently abusing a boy, Irtyshov squeezed his throat too much, causing him to die from suffocation. Igor himself later said that he did want to kill him, but simply did not calculate the strength, because he was drunk. After this, an active search was conducted to catch the serial rapist. Many criminals who were brought to criminal responsibility for such offenses were tried. The next child Irtyshov raped was in May 1994. He dragged a 10-year-old boy into the attic of a house along the Riga Avenue and brutally raped him. After the act of violence, Igor broke the boy's hands, leaving him permanently disabled. It is noteworthy that all the attacks were committed in the daytime, approximately between 12 and 18 hours, but the perpetrator managed to escape unnoticed. A month later he raped two more boys, 11 and 12 years old, on the banks of the Neva River. The seventh victim of the pedophile almost became a 15-year-old teenager, whom the criminal attacked in an elevator. However, the boy managed to fight back and escaped. On the same day, Igor, who was angry because of his failure, committed his eighth, and final, crime. After brutally raping a 9-year-old boy, he left the crime scene. The boy miraculously survived and was able to give a detailed description of the criminal. After that, he was put in a hospital in the United States, with calls for financial help on the television for the necessary operation, but in spite of the fact that the necessary amount of intestines were collected for an organ transplantation, the boy died. This crime, like the many others of Irtyshov, were committed in front of the victim's residence.  Arrest and trial  On the streets and in the newspapers, the rapist's facial composite and his verbal description were distributed. Irtyshov was frightened: the composite was very similar to him, which forced him to fly to Murmansk. A month later, having decided that everything had quieted down, Igor returned to St. Petersburg, where on November 28, 1994, he was detained by law enforcement agencies, which by that time had amassed a vast amount of evidence against him. Irtyshov was \\"given up\\" by one of his lovers. After the last rape, Igor brought the boy's briefcase home and boasted about it to his roommate. He suspected something was amiss and turned to the police. Soon Irtyshov was captured, and later many victims identified him. For a long time, Irtyshov did not give any confessions. However, later he began to talk about the crimes and participated in investigative experiments. At the interrogations he behaved inadequetly, and pretended to be mentally defective. Psychiatric examinations of the maniac took a long time. As a result, the experts identified a number of mental abnormalities, but in general, Irtyshov was declared sane. The case was then referred to the city court of St. Petersburg. Many forensic experts were inclined to believe that soon Irtyshov would begin to purposefully kill his victims, and in addition to rapes, there would be a chain of corpses. Irtyshov noted that he liked the clinic where he was examined, and said that he would like to be recognized as insane and prescribed compulsory treatment. He said: \\"I'm crazy, since I did this...Exactly abnormal! I do not want to go to jail, put me in hosptail, forever!\\" However, he was not recognized as insane, as he \\"had enough intelligence to lead the investigation.\\" Irtyshov's trial was closed in order to avoid lynching. In total, he was accused of violating 15 articles from the Criminal Code of Russia. The court found Igor guilty of several articles, including murder, rape, serious bodily harm, and was sentenced to death. In 1999, in connection with Russia's accession with the Council of Europe, he, like all other \\"suicide bombers\\" at the time, was given life imprisonment by presidential decree.

It was designed by William Slade and built from 1914 to 1914 by W. 'Ossie' Knowles. It is also known as Lindfield Wesleyan Methodist Church. The property is owned by the Uniting Church in Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 September 2003.  History  = General History = A comprehensive history of the Methodists in the area and the chapels they built is given in A Cloud of Witnesses at Tryon Road Uniting Church by Geoffrey Stacey, 1996, published by the Lindfield Tryon Road Uniting Church Centenary Committee. Lindfield became the name of the area after it was adopted for the name for the station on the new railway line linking St Leonards and Hornsby in 1890. The name was taken from a cottage of that name built by Francis John List who came from Lindfield, West Sussex in southern England. Tryon Road may have been named after Rear Admiral Sir George Tryon, commander in the Australian Navy in the 1880s. It is suggested that he was a friend or relative of List. In the early 1890s, as the expansion of the North Shore got under way following the building of the railway in 1890, the decision to build a church in the Willoughby/Lindfield Methodist circuit was made. Land was purchased from Thomas Todd Forsyth (who held part of an original Crown Grant of 1819 to Daniel Dering Mathew) by seven members of the congregation. This plot was just south of the Gordon Road (now Pacific Highway) entry to the Lindfield railway station. No drawings or plans of this church exist but a photograph and description is given in the book mentioned above. The church was formally opened on 19 April 1896. After a disappointing start where numbers attending services were not as hoped by the Trustees, numbers climbed to a point where the congregation began discussing the need for a new church. = History of the Church = After long debate it was decided to purchase land on the corner of Tryon and Nelson Roads. After further debate it was decided to build both church and halls at the same time. The architect, Mr Slade, is noted as being persuasive of building a complete set of facilities rather than wait until funds became available. Reported in The Methodist of 1914: The church was formally opened on 19 September 1914 at a Special Public Meeting and Service. The architect of these new buildings was William Slade and the builder was W. O. J. Knowles. Slade (1847-1935) was the half brother of church trustee Percy Newman Slade. He was born in Surry Hills but trained as an architect in England. On his return it seems he worked for Harry Kent. Slade designed the Roseville Methodist Church in Cardigan Street, Camperdown (now the Camperdown Stanmore Community Church of the Assembly of Confessing Congregations). The Slades were a prominent family of Methodists and they had particular interests in Tryon Road: Percy Newman Slade (1972-1944) had settled in the Lindfield area at the commencement of his professional career as an accountant and real estate agent. Percy was prominent in the Methodist Church, being an original trustee of the local church and financial adviser to the Central Methodist Mission. In 1895 he married Claudia Brown, the daughter of Dr George Brown, a former Methodist missionary in the South Pacific. Percy settled at Malila at No. 13-15 Tryon Road in 1906. Percy's elder sister, Kate Watkin (1864-1944), developed the properties at No. 23-25 Tryon Road around the same time. No. 17 Tryon Road was owned and developed around 1906 by Louisa Slade, Percy's widowed mother. William Slade's architectural drawings do not seem to have survived, but good written descriptions of the fabric of the church as completed are available. At the time of the opening in 1914, the correspondent for The Methodist described the church as follows: The main material used in the building is brick, relieved by stone-dressings introduced at openings, and with a high stone base course throughout. The brickwork is tuck-pointed, such parts usually plastered inside are tuck-pointed also. The elevation to Tryon Rd shows a fine gable with large triplet windows of leaded coloured glass in original designs, on the south side is the turret, containing a fine toned bell, and on the north side a large porch, each giving access to the main building. The interior of the church which is by is lit from the sides by eight windows, each of to lancets and circle grouped and filled with leaded coloured glass, similar to the front. The ceiling of the interior is formed by the line of collar ties in the centre and lower portions of principals at the sides - furring pieces being introduced to form a continuous clear line from end to end, relieved by moulded ribs and panelling. Delicate tie rods span the whole. The average height of the ceiling of the church is . That of the school hall is 18 ft; being treated somewhat in the manner as described of the church. A sloping floor is provided for the church - the average height of the interior walls from the floor being . Accommodation is provided for 350 persons with an additional 25 persons in the choir; which is semi-circular and raised in steps on a platform extending across the end of the church, one side of which is occupied by an ornamental rostrum. The seats throughout are of Queensland Kauri, having ornamental stall ends, slightly stained and varnished. A sliding door leading from the end of the church opens into the school block attached, which comprises a hall by , with a raised platform, six class rooms, ; grouped about the same. The infant's room also being by , and a sewing room . The library and principal porch of the school are grouped, being a small semi-octagonal wing forming a pleasing feature on the Nelson Road frontage. Minister and choir vestries, with separate external entrances are provided, and appurtances throughout for the complete carrying out of all functions of a public and social nature. The roofs externally are covered with slates except the turret, which is one of Muntz metal, finished with a finial. The porches are tiled and the entrance steps are of marble, with wing walls of stone. The alignment of the Tryon and Nelson Roads is formed by ornamental open fencing and brick dwarf walling.\\" The outlay of A‚Ç§5,600 included the cost of installing an organ that had originated in Ireland, having been imported into the colony for use in the original St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney. The major alteration to the church Slade designed occurred in 1935 following a resolution of 1934 to change the altar area and relocate the organ from the front in the sanctuary to a new purpose designed organ chamber within a transept. In the remodelling of the sanctuary a new wood panelled reredos was fitted and the communion rails extended forward at the sides. The pulpit was retained in its original position, but the babtismal font was reset. The choir was enlarged to accommodate 42. The architect was N. S. W. McPherson. Eight chimes were installed in the tower in 1936 as a memorial to Walter J Cryer. Another five were added in 1940 as a memorial to Mrs Agnes Cryer. Following amalgamation of the Methodist Church with the Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches as the Uniting Church of Australia in 1977, the church has continued to be used by the local congregation. = Organ History = The organ began life in Ireland and was imported for use in St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney. Purchased by the Wesleyan Methodists for the Macquarie Street Chapel in 1839 and later removed to the York Street Chapel. It was rebuilt by C. J. Jackson in 1868 and further enlarged by William Davidson in 1888. When the York Street Chapel was replaced by the Centenary Hall the organ was rebuilt therein in 1903 by George Fincham & Son of Melbourne. It became one of the largest organs in New South Wales (the only larger ones at that time were in Sydney Town Hall, St Andrew's Cathedral and St Saviours Cathedral, Goulburn). In 1908 it was moved to the \\"Conference Hall\\" in Castlereagh Street and remained there until it was purchased by the Tryon Road Methodist Church in Lindfield. It was moved from the front of the church in the Sanctuary to the purpose built organ trancept in 1935. The organ was rebuilt and restored in 2001 and now occupies a slightly larger area than previously. The facing organ pipes are now polychromatic as they were when the organ was erected in the Centenary Hall in York Street.  Description  The complex consists of the Church (orientated on a north-west to south-east axis) and two adjoining halls with ancillary rooms at its south-east end. The complex sits on a corner site bounded on the northern side by Tryon Road, the eastern by Nelson Road and the southern by Tryon Lane. On the north-east side towards Nelson Road is a large Hill's fig tree (Ficus microcarpa var.Hillii) and crazy-paved sandstone driveway half loop. The complex was designed and built as a whole in 1914, with the exception of a 1935 transept on the north- east (detailed to match the church), and a small modern extension containing toilets which sits at the western end of the smaller hall. The building is Federation Gothic in style with Arts and Craft and Art Nouveau influences. The building is constructed of red tuck-pointed brickwork with sandstone dressings to all openings, the whole sitting on a rusticated sandstone base. Contrasting blue bricks are used in the arched heads over windows and on the double curved tops of the buttresses. Moulded bricks are also used for string-courses and as decorative elements. The detailing throughout is well considered and of very high quality. The roof, which is generally gabled in form, is of grey slate with terra cotta ridge and hip cappings. The main entrance to the church off Tryon Road includes a covered way from the street to a flight of marble steps leading up to the front door, over which rises a squat tower. The tower roof is bell-caste in form, clad in copper sheet with curved decorative pressed metal panels to the eaves fascias. Gargoyles shed water from the four corners of the roof. The porch is tiled with small mosaic tiles (s). A stair leads up into the bell ringers chamber. The tower contains a single bell and a carillion of 8 tubular bells in an open chamber under the tower roof. The windows to the tower include Art Nouveau leadlight. The timber floor of the church slopes down from the entry to the chancel area. The walls are of face brick with a plaster dado panel, topped by a timber dado rail at sill height. The ceiling features decorative fibrous plaster panels with moulded battening. Tie rods extend across the width of the church at regular intervals. The windows within the church are generally of high quality stained glass, set in quoined sandstone surrounds. The chancel is raised on a stepped platform. The pews are of stained and polished timber. The balustrading and communion rail to the chancel area, choir stalls and former font enclosure is all of a matching design featuring pointed arched panels and brackets. The raised pulpit features panels in the shape of shields. There is also a matching lectern and a marble font. A very tall and elaborately panelled timber reredos is set against the painted battened fibro rear wall of the chancel. The first organ was originally set against this, but has been replaced by a timber altar table (). Other chancel furniture includes a communion table and chairs A very fine and recently restored organ of considerable historic interest (refer to history) is built into a transept extension (1935) on the eastern side of the chancel. Two vestries connect the church to two halls at the rear, one larger Sunday school hall and a second kindergarten hall. These spaces, together with their ancillary spaces generally have timber floors and plastered walls and battened fibrous plaster ceilings, painted. At the rear of the large hall are three smaller spaces for the meeting of small groups, which are original to the design. One of these has since been enclosed as an office. A small library room was included just off the main entrance porch to this hall, the window through which the books were borrowed still existing. Opposite this entry is another door with a flight of steps leading down to the rear yard. The western end of the hall contains a raised stage. A modern toilet extension has been built off the smaller hall, cutting through the original windows in this wall. = Condition = As at 30 May 2003, the church was generally in good condition. There is evidence of salt attack in the walls of the organ transept and east wall of the church. The archaeological potential is unknown. The whole church and hall complex has a very high degree of integrity. The original buildings are substantially intact with the 1935 alterations and additions to the organ and chancel area complementing the original in both style and quality. The later additions to the rear of the small hall have minimal impact on the whole. = Modifications and dates = *1935 - new organ chamber installed and organ moved from Sanctuary (N W McPherson Architect) *1990s - toilet and store extension  Heritage listing  As at 9 August 2011, the Tryon Road Uniting Church, constructed in 1914 in the Federation Gothic style with Arts & Crafts influences, is of aesthetic significance at the State level. Externally and internally, the church complex is an unspoiled instance of Australian Edwardian design. Harmonious furnishings and stained glass from distinguished Sydney firms contribute to a beautiful interior, and enhance its Arts & Crafts design. The organ has historic, social and technical significance at State level. It comprises pipework from an early Irish organ used at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, in 1839, purchased for the Wesleyan Church first in Macquarie Street and later York Street; it was rebuilt and enlarged at different times by the important Sydney builders Charles Jackson and William Davidson and the great Melbourne firm of George Fincham & Sons. It is a rare instrument with unusual size and power, and interesting tonal character. The organ case is of cedar and possesses unusually high quality design and workmanship. It has recently been restored to its Macquarie Street glory. The complex comprises church and hall and is of local significance for its social associations with Lindfield from the early years of the suburb to the present time. It is a rare instance of church premises designed by the Roseville architect William Slade, who also designed the Roseville Uniting Church, and many other local buildings in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Tryon Road Uniting Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 September 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Tryon Road Methodist church is of historical significance as part of the story of the growth of the North Shore suburbs in the early 20th century. This church replaced an earlier Methodist church which stood on another site nearby. The church contains an organ of great historic significance, the first portion originally being imported from Ireland for St Mary's Cathedral in 1839, it contains a significant amount of pre 1870s pipework which is rare in Australia. It is also one of the largest nineteenth century pipe organs in NSW. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Tryon Road Methodist Church is associated with the Architect William Slade and the local builder W O J Knowles. Slade is also known for his design of the Roseville Methodist Church 1907. The organ has been rebuilt by several organ builders of note including C.J. Jackson, William Davidson and George Fincham & Son. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The buildings have exceptional aesthetic significance as an intact and highly refined and detailed example of a Federation Gothic style church with Arts & Crafts and Art Nouveau influences (especially in the tower roof). Harmonious furnishings and stained glass from distinguished Sydney firms both enhance and contribute to the quality of the place. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site has social significance as a place of worship and in community use for 88 years on this site (and over 100 in Lindfield). The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The organ has a high degree of technical and research significance, comprising pipework from the original Irish organ, and having been enlarged and rebuilt several times by significant organ builders. The most recent work was carried out in 2001 and the organ is in excellent working order. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The church is a rare example of a pre World War I church and hall complex, including all ancillary facilities, being constructed all at one time and within one building. It is also a rare example of Federation Gothic church with high quality Arts and Craft and Art Nouveau detailing. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The church and hall complex is representative of the strong church - community relationship in the growing North Shore suburbs prior to World War I, and the commitment of the Methodist Church to providing facilities for community use, this being a major influence on the design of the complex and the decision to build all the facilities as a whole.

CMLL has intermittently held a show billed specifically as Sin Piedad since 2000, primarily using the name for their \\"end of the year\\" show in December, although once they held a Sin Piedad show in August as well. CMLL has on occasion used a different name for the end-of-year show but Sin Piedad is the most commonly used name. All Sin Piedad shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". The 2018 Sin Piedad was the third first show to be held on New Year's Day after being held on the same day in 2016 and 2017. Starting in 2011 CMLL has been promoting a New Year's Day show with bigger, more prominent and promoted matches, although they did not specifically promote the shows under a special event name, they were simply a special version of their weekly Arena Mexico shows. Starting in 2011 CMLL added at least one high profile match to their shows, slowly building them into a special event. in 2011 the show featured the annual Reyes del Aire (\\"Kings of the Air\\") tournament, won by √Ångel de Oro.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 2001. Outline The Yanaidanu-no-Oyama Kofun is located in the northwest part of Toyama prefecture, near the eastern base of Noto Peninsula and near the shore of Toyama Bay, at an altitude of approximately 25 meters above sea level. With a length of 107.5 meters, it is the largest keyhole-shaped tumulus in Toyama Prefecture, and the 10th largest in the country. It was discovered only in 1998, and was excavated from 1998-2001. No haniwa or fukiishi were discovered on the kofun, which was found to have been robbed at some time in antiquity. The time of its construction is estimated to date from the end of the 3rd to the late 4th century, and there is no indication of who was buried in this tomb. The area is now open to the public as part of an archaeological park. *Total length: 107.5 meters *Main Portion: 2-stages, 54 meter length x 53 meter width x 10 meter height *Keyway Portion: 2-stages, 53.5 meter length x 49 meter width x 6 meter height The tumulus was constructed by partly cutting away the round on a narrow terrace, such that the embankment volume is about 60% of the total volume of the tumulus. The tumulus was surrounded by a amorphous moat measuring 5 to 18 meters wide and 1.2 to 1.2 meters deep. The tomb appears to be built on the site of a Yayoi period settlement, as pottery from that period has been found in the area. There is a smaller (25 meter diameter) circular tumulus surrounded by a five-meter wide and 1.6 meter deep moat is located on the eastern rear side of the tomb. Details of its construction are unknown as it has not been excavated: however, from the details of its construction, there is a possibility that it predates the keyhole-shaped tomb.

Biography  Zamulin was born and grew up in a prosperous, working family. His service was held in the Ministry of Emergency Situations in Pervouralsk. During his dismissal he had the opportunity to come home to Yekaterinburg. After serving in the military, he got a job in the Special Communications Service, under the Federal Protective Service, gaining the rank of praporshchik. Since December 2005, he worked as a driver in the FSO Department, and was characterized positively. Two years later, he met and began a relationship with a girl but, upon their break up, Zamulin began to feel hatred towards women. From September 16 to November 4, 2016, Zamulin raped and killed six women and girls, all in the evening. To achieve this, he used the VAZ-2106 company car with tinted windows. A convenient working schedule - a five-day week or a day through three - allowed him to go searching for victims. Using his certificate as an FSO officer, he successfully passed police cordons. Driving through Yekaterinburg under the guise of a private driver, he selected female hitchhikers, brought them to uninhabited places, where he raped and strangled his victims. He then took money, mobile phones and other valuables from the dead. The bodies were thrown out in wastelands near garages or on roads. One victim of Zamulin survived his attacks. The sixth victim's mobile phone was traced by police, and as a result went to Zamulin's cousin, who had received the phone. On November 7, 2006, Zamulin was arrested. At the time of his arrest, he had changed the inner lining of the car, on which the blood of the victims remained. When they searched his apartment, items belonging to the victims were found. The only surviving victim identified him as her attacker. When checking the records of outdoor nightclub cameras, where the sixth victim had been on the night of the attack, Zamulin's car was caught on tape and he was filmed approaching her. The records of the external surveillance cameras at the victim's residence were also examined and Zamulin's car was visible in the courtyard, but the woman did not leave it. Under pressure, he confessed to seven murders associated with rape, not knowing that one of the victims was still alive, although he initially was suspected of committing only four murders. Earlier, in connection with two cases to which the criminal confessed, the examination could not prove his guilt and the institution refused any further criminal proceedings. With the second examination, the murders were proven and the previous results were regarded as erroneous. The forensic psychiatric examination found Zamulin sane. On December 24, 2007, the Ural Oblast Military Court sentenced him to life imprisonment in a special regime correctional colony. At the trial, Zamulin refuted all of his testimonies, except for the last murder, and stated that he would appeal the court's decision. The Supreme Court of Russia, after reviewing the cassation appeal, left the verdict unchanged. = In the media = * Documentary film \\"The Night Carrier\\" from the series \\"Criminal Chronicles\\" See also * List of Russian serial killers  References   External links  * Sexual maniacs.

It was formally inaugurated by Francisco Franco on 27 October 1955.  Description  Located in front of the Prado Museum, it features a central prismatic 16-floor brick tower,; that reaches a 60-metre height. The landmark symbolically marked the acceptance of modern architecture by the Francoist regime in terms of architectural language, straying away from previous traditionalist aesthetics. It has often been linked to the works of Italian Fascist architect Giuseppe Terragni.

The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as part of the East Hampton Village District. Ref# 74001309 History Pantigo Windmill and St.Lukes Church 20180916 The Pantigo Mill was built on Mill Hill on the common at the south end of East Hampton, the third windmill to occupy that site. The Mill Hill had been built up from a natural rise in 1729 when a post mill was moved there. The post mill was replaced by a new windmill in 1771. Samuel Schellinger began building the Pantigo Windmill for Huntting Miller in March of 1804. He built the Pantigo Mill and the Beebe Windmill and his work was not confined to the east end of Long Island. He built a windmill in Setauket in the 1820s and, according to his apprentice, William Baker, Schellinger built windmills at Brooklyn, Nantucket, and Block Island. He also did considerable work on boats at Sag Harbor. Samuel Schellinger charged Huntting Miller for 83 days of his own time and an additional 144 days for the work of his assistants, James Raynor, Mathew and Richard. Also assisting on the mill was David Sherril, an East Hampton carpenter whose account book shows that he repaired several local windmills. In the summer of 1804 David Sherril charged Huntting Miller for thirty-five days work on the mill. In June Sherril noted he was framing the mill and in August he was working on \\"the Mills running gear.\\" Three months later the owners of the windmill across the common also began constructing a windmill with intermediate gearing. This was to replace their mill built in 1769. This second windmill, the Gardiner Mill, was being built under the direction of Nathaniel Dominy IV. Nathaniel Dominy V does not mention the Pantigo windmill until 1821 when in his accounts he noted on a repair bill, \\"put Shaft beam to Mill\\" for Huntting Miller.Felix Dominy, Nathaniel Dominy V and Nathaniel Dominy VII Account Book, 1809-1862, East Hampton Free Library. Laws in the 18th century accommodated the miller. One story of the Miller was that as the minister was doing a sermon he heard the whispering wind outside. \\"Church will be dismissed, Miller, go to your mill and grind.\\" The law of the town specified that the minister's grist was to be the first ground.https://www.google.com/books/edition/Windmills_and_Water_Mills_of_Long_Island pg. 12 Ownership Ownership of the Pantigo changed over a period of years. Huntting Miller left his property and the windmill to his grandson, Captain William Hedges, who acquired the mill in 1832. In 1834 Hedges had the mill's machinery put in good order, as Nathaniel Dominy V charged him for sixteen days labor to \\"put in shaft Cogs and Rounds.\\" In 1845 William Hedges sold the mill to David A. Hedges who moved it to his property on the north side of Pantigo Road about one half mile east of the village. David Hedges sold the mill to Hiram Sandford who moved it to the corner of Pantigo Road and Egypt Lane where it stood until 1917. https://easthampton.com/history/village-of- east-hampton/ This seventy-two year residence on Pantigo Road gave the mill its present name. Some time before 1865, Sandford sold the mill to Nathaniel Dominy VII, who also owned the Old Hook Mill. An inscription on the stairway in the Pantigo Mill indicates that Dominy was repairing the mill in February 1878 and that he \\"Commenced to Grind\\" on 12 June 1878. Unfortunately Dominy only had a year of service from his mill following these repairs, for in August of 1879 a storm, described as the \\"heaviest since 1811\\" \\"twisted off\\" the iron cross holding the sails stocks.\\" Dominy never put the mill back in running order. The Sag Harbor Express (21 August 1879) -Egypt Mill has arm twisted in storm The Pantigo Windmill was purchased in 1917 by Gustav Buek who moved it to the rear of his house on the East Hampton Common. After Mr. Buek died, the Village of East Hampton acquired his seventeenth-century house, known as \\"Home Sweet Home,\\" and the windmill. The Village undertook extensive repairs to the mill in 1978-1979 and 1984-85. http://www.aaqeastend.com/contents/landmarks/pantigo-mill-1804-east-hampton/ References External links Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Museums in Suffolk County, New York Category:East Hampton (village), New York Category:Living museums in New York (state) Category:Farm museums in New York (state) Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Historic American Engineering Record in New York (state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Suffolk County, New York Category:Mill museums in New York (state) Category:Windmills in New York (state) Category:Tourist attractions in Suffolk County, New York Category:East Hampton (town), New York Category:Buildings and structures in Suffolk County, New York Category:Historic district contributing properties in New York (state) Category:Smock mills in the United States ","title":"Pantigo Windmill"},{"id":"58557507","text":"Padberg may refer to: *Padberg, Marsberg, a district of the town Marsberg in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany *Padberg (Teutoburg Forest), spur of the Barnacken hill in the Teutoburg Forest, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany *Lutz von Padberg (b. 1950), German historian whose specialty is medieval history *Eva Padberg (b. 1980), German fashion model, singer, and actress ","title":"Padberg"},{"id":"58557530","text":"The 1987‚Äì88 Soviet Cup was a cup competition of the Soviet Union.

The general gets assisted by a professorhttps://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/smet_de.htm who makes up a plan or invents a new machine to make the attempt a success, and a soldier https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/smet_de.htm who drives the general to the fortress to execute the plan. The soldier is vocal about his reluctance which puts him often at odds with the general. The characters are usually anonymous, only in one story it transpires that the general's forenames are Jozef Maria Ignatius. The stories are set on an open field in a parallel version of the Netherlands which in reality has no generals or marshals. The drive from the tree, where the general lives with his pet duckling, to the fortress is lightened up by a revolving host of supporting characters; some of them have religious backgrounds, like the pastor who relies on the importance \\"chewing your sandwiches well\\" (Dutch slang for sandwiches: bammetjes) or the gospel- spreading samba-percussionist and his fellow convert. The most notorious character is the police scout who has his own ambitions to fulfill; receiving the Honorary Brass Whistle. He thinks that fining the general will help him achieve his goal, but instead he drifts further away from it; his motorbike gets trashed while his boss relegates him to cleaning jobs of even greater disaster. = Alternative endings = *Sometimes the general escapes prison because the fortress is abandoned (which makes the attempt invalid) or because his disguise is unrecognisable to the extent that he's refused entry. *In one story, mainly drawn in black-and-white, the general manages to overthrow the marshal by driving a supertank. This appears to be a cut and paste move specially made to keep the general's spirits high. = Tribute = The 16-2013-issue of Eppo published a Pep-special which included a tribute-story by Mars Gremmen.

Biography  Maria (Rie) L√∂hnis was the daughter of Frederik Bernard L√∂hnis, an Inspector of Secondary Education, and Laurensina Johanna 's Jacob. L√∂hnis started working with Johanna Westerdijk at the Willie Commelin Scholten Phytopathological Laboratory in Amsterdam in 1913, and moved with the laboratory to Villa Java in Baarn in 1920. Along with Marie Beatrice Schwarz, L√∂hnis was one of Westerdijk's first students. Her doctoral work at the University of Utrecht concerned the influence of weather on potato blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, and was funded by the Research and Advisory Committee for Public Welfare and National Defence. This work resulted in her PhD thesis, entitled Investigation into Phytophthora infestans infection on potato plants (Dutch: Onderzoek over Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de By op de aardappelplant). L√∂hnis received her PhD in 1922. This work also resulted in the publication of Investigation on the relation between the weather conditions and the occurrence of Potato Blight (Phytophthora infestans) in 1924. Between 1930 and 1944, L√∂hnis carried out investigations into the symbiotic relationship between plants and nitrogen fixing Rhizobium bacteria. This work was started in Madison, USA, and finished in the laboratory of Albert Kluyver in Delft. L√∂hnis found that Rhizobia bacteria are unable to fix nitrogen in pure culture. During the Second World War, L√∂hnis worked in Wagenigen and published two books - Plant Nutrition (Dutch: Plantenvoeding) in 1946, and Role of Microorganisms in Daily Life (Dutch: Rol der Micro-organismen in het dagelijks leven) in 1948. L√∂hnis was also an editor for the journal, 'Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Journal of Microbiology and Serology'. In 1963, L√∂hnis published a biography of Johanna Westerdijk.

He fought on Antigua in 1666 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. He was governor of Guadeloupe from 1677 to 1694. The Nine Years' War broke out in 1688 and Guadeloupe was invaded by the English in 1691. The French defenders were outnumbered and retreated, but the effect of disease, heavy rain and the arrival of French reinforcements led to the English leaving after a few weeks. Early years Hincelin was the brother- in-law of Charles Hou√´l du Petit Pr√©. Hou√´l was governor of Guadeloupe from 1643 to 1656. Hou√´l had taken leave in Paris, where he married Mlle. Hincelin. They returned in 1656. Hincelin was appointed the king's lieutenant on Guadeloupe. Hou√´l signed a solemn peace treaty with the Island Caribs in 1660. It proved more difficult to maintain peace within the leading families of Guadeloupe. The cantankerous governor soon stirred up quarrels with his brother and his nephews. Hincelin thought he could take advantage of the situation and almost came to blows with Hou√´l. The king was dragged into the quarrel, and on 25 May 1660 wrote a letter to the aging lieutenant-general Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy asking him to restore peace on Guadeloupe and to stop the proceedings of Houeil against the widow of Jacques de Boisseret and her children. Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy, appointed lieutenant-general of the American mainland and islands, left La Rochelle on 26 February 1664, took 200 colonists under Antoine Lef√®bvre de La Barre to Cayenne, then sailed north to reach Martinique on 3 June 1664. There he published a 26-point ordinance spelling out punishments for offenses such as blasphemy and miscegenation. Tracy reached Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe on 23 June 1664, and instructed Hou√§l, d'Erbray and Th√©m√©ricourt to leave for France. He made Claude Fran√ßois du Lyon governor of Guadeloupe and Gabriel de Folio, sieur des Roses commander of Marie-Galante. Hincelin was authorized to remain in Guadeloupe to look after the interests of his brother-in-law. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1666‚Äì67) La Barre, newly appointed lieutenant-general arrived in the Antilles late in 1866 with a fleet and 400 soldiers. A council of war was held on Martinique in late 1866 in which it was agreed to attack Antigua. A fleet under the command of La Barre arrived in Antigua on 4 November 1666. After overcoming some resistance governor Robert de Clodor√© of Martinique accepted the English capitulation on 10 November 1666. The French then left for Saint Christophe. On 30 November 1666 Clodor√© returned to Saint John's harbor, Antigua with almost 1,000 men. He learned that 900 Englishmen from Barbuda and Nevis had gathered in the northern district of Pope's Head and were being joined by Antiguan settlers. Clodor√© took his fleet to Pope's head where he disembarked his force, with Hencelin and Blondel as seconds in command. They at once charged into the English force which fled in disarray and escaped by sea. There were no French casualties. Governor of Guadeloupe Charles Fran√ßois du Lyon, governor of Guadeloupe, died in July 1677. Hincelin was named provisional governor in his place. He became governor of Guadeloupe on 5 July 1677 under Charles de Courbon de Bl√©nac, governor and lieutenant-general of the islands and mainland of America. The king named M. de Baaz de l'Herpini√®re, nephew of the former governor general Jean-Charles de Baas, as the successor to Du Lion. When that nomination failed to take effect, Hincelin was confirmed as governor. During the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì97) the governor general Bl√©nac resigned on 29 January 1690 after criticism of his lack of response to the English attacks on Saint Barth√©lemy, Marie-Galante and Saint Martin, and returned to France to defend himself at court. Fran√ßois d'Alesso d'√âragny was appointed his successor in May 1690, but the marquis de Seignelay did not treat his departure as a matter of urgency. D'Eragny arrived in Martinique on 5 February 1691 with 14 ships and began to strengthen the defenses. Guadeloupe (left) and Marie-Galante (lower right) In April 1691 an English fleet under Commodore Wright and Governor General Christopher Codrington disembarked troops in Marie-Galante, which they captured from the 240-man garrison under governor Charles Auger. On 1 May 1691 the English fleet arrived off the west of Guadeloupe and bombarded the town of Baillif to the north of Basse-Terre before disembarking further north at Anse √† la Barque. Hincelin was suffering from severe hydropsy. He was ill and bedridden, thought the English were bluffing and sent only a small force north to watch the English. Codrington advanced south against weak resistance. 400 men under the king's lieutenant Robert Cloche de La Malmaison delayed the English before being forced back. On 3 May the English defeated a French force at the Duplessis River, and resistance collapsed. The French retreated south past Baillif and Basse-Terre. Some of the French troops took refuge in Fort Saint- Charles(fr) and were besieged. The next day the English set fire to Basse- Terre. On 23 May Codrington, whose force was becoming weakened by disease, heard that a French fleet under Jean-Baptiste Ducasse had arrived with reinforcements. The French force regained Marie-Galante and then started disembarking reinforcements in the northeast Grand-Terre district. Codrington hastily reembarked leaving behind cannons and some of his wounded. The English left the island on 25 May. Hincelin, who had long been ill, died on 15 June 1695. He left his considerable fortune to the four religious orders on Guadeloupe. He was succeeded as governor of Guadeloupe by Charles Auger, who took office on 15 July 1695.

Colman was born at Norwich to Edith Margaret Davies and her husband Russell James Colman. He was educated at Eton College, before attending Christ Church, Oxford. While still attending Eton, Colman made his minor counties debut for Norfolk in the 1911 Minor Counties Championship, making three appearances in that season. His debut in first-class cricket came the following year for Oxford University against the touring South Africans at the Magdalen Ground, Oxford. Prior to the start of World War I, Colman made 22 first-class appearances for the university. Playing primarily as a right-handed batsman, Colman scored 946 runs, making one century score of 127 against Hampshire in 1913. He gained his Oxford blue in 1913. With the onset of war, Colman enlisted in the British Army. He served in the 7th Battalion, The Rifles on the Western Front with the rank of second lieutenant. He later served in the Machine Gun Corps, achieving the rank of temporary captain in January 1917. During the course of the war he was severely wounded, which would affect him in later years. Following the war, Colman married Lettice Elizabeth Evelyn Adeane on 25 February 1919, with the couple having five children (including Timothy Colman). He also resumed playing minor counties cricket for Norfolk, representing his home county until 1930, but the wounds he sustained during the war curtailed his minor counties career. He made one final appearance in first-class cricket when he was selected to play for the combined Minor Counties cricket team in 1924 against the touring South Africans at the County Ground, Lakenham. As a member of the Norwich Colman's family, he served as a company director until his death at Framingham Earl, Norfolk, on 18 March 1935, from endocarditis caused by a chest wound sustained during the war. After his death, the thatched pavilion at the County Ground in Lakenham was erected in his memory in 1936.

She was an awardee of the Bj√∏rnson Prize of the Norwegian Academy of Literature and Freedom of Expression for \\"extensive contribution to strengthening the freedom of expression in Russia.\\" Life Zinaida Mirkina was born on 10 January 1926 in Moscow. Her parents were Alexander Mirkin, an engineer, and Alexandra Mirkina, an economist. Her grandfather, Aaron Mirkin, had been a watchmaker in Saint Petersburg. Her family was Jewish. Mirkina attended the philological department of Moscow University from 1943 to 1948. She wrote her thesis but was unable to write the state examinations on account of a debilitating illness that made her bedridden for five years and left her partially blind. Though she had grown up in an ardent Communist family, she experienced a spiritual split between the historical optimism of Bolshevism and an understanding of life's essential tragedy. Mirkina was married to the philosopher Grigory Pomerants. She died in Moscow on 21 September 2018. Career From the middle of the 1950s, Mirkina began her career as a translator. She translated Sufi poetry (which was first published in 1975 in the volume Arab poetry of the middle ages in the series Library of World Literature), as well as works by Rabindranath Tagore and Rainer Maria Rilke (in particular, his Sonnets to Orpheus). Mirkina's literary work stemmed from her experiences of suffering, her poetry becoming her call to God. Informed by her Jewishness, she combined the Christian view that the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus, thus facing the consequences of that action. She glorified God to her own abnegation and saw every recurrence of her illness as a cycle of death and survival. Her poetry expanded beyond Christian ethics to a universal sentiment of faith which people could absorb regardless of their religion. In the 1990s, she began to publish her own works extensively. A collection of poetry Loss of losses came out in 1991, followed by Fire and Ashes (essays on Marina Tsvetaeva, 1993) and Truth and its twins (essays on Fyodor Dostoevsky and Alexander Pushkin, 1993). With her husband, she published Great religions of the world in 1995. In 1988, she joined In your name, a union of spiritual poets.

The Rarotonga hotspot is a volcanic hotspot in the southern Pacific Ocean. The hotspot was responsible for the formation of Rarotonga and some volcanics of Aitutaki. In addition to these volcanoes in the Cook Islands, the composition of volcanic rocks in Samoa and in the Lau Basin may have been influenced by the Rarotonga hotspot, and some atolls and seamounts in the Marshall Islands may have formed on the hotspot as well.  Geology  Oceanic plateaus and linear volcanic chains dot the floor of the Pacific Ocean. Their formation has been explained with mantle plumes which rise from the core- mantle boundary and spread out when they rise, forming a large \\"head\\" that causes intense volcanic activity once it hits the crust. This volcanism is responsible for the formation of the oceanic plateaus. Later, the remnant \\"tail\\" of the plume is still rising and induces the formation of volcano chains as the crust moves over the plume tail, thus forming the linear chains. A number of hotspots are or were active in the Pacific Ocean and some of these may be the product of mantle plumes. Other hotspots such as Rarotonga appear to have been active only for short time periods; many of these are located in French Polynesia where there is a superswell. Such hotspot volcanism may be the product of shallow processes. Later research has suggested however that the Macdonald hotspot, the Rarotonga hotspot and the Rurutu hotspot are long lived hotspots that were active as far back as the Cretaceous; they may be over 100 million years old and in such case the oldest still active hotspots in the Pacific. Seismic tomography has found slow velocity anomalies underneath the Rarotonga hotspot, down to depths of about with more recent research indicating that they root at about depth. The anomaly lies at over depth with no evidence of shallower anomalies, however.  Products  The Rarotonga hotspot is reliably linked only to the formation of Rarotonga, potential volcanic structures between the Tonga Trench and Rarotonga that may have been formed by the same hotspot are poorly studied. Rarotonga itself is young but there is little indication of volcanism either southeast or northwest from it. Other candidate volcanoes/structures formed by the Rarotonga hotspot or influenced by it are: * Rarotonga. * The young volcanics of Aitutaki. * Rose Atoll and Malulu Seamount may have been formed by the Rarotonga hotspot, but other hotspots are also candidates. The connection to Rarotonga is supported by geochemical traits. * Uo Mamae seamount in Samoa share geochemical traits with the Rarotonga hotspot and plate motion reconstructions indicate that the hotspot track passed through it. Potentially, the hotspot formed Uo Mamae and local tectonic processes later (940,000 years ago) triggered rejuvenated volcanism. * The composition of rejuvenated volcanism in Samoa may bear traces of the influence of the Rarotonga hotspot, which passed across Samoa in the past. * Reconstructions of the path of the Rarotonga hotspot imply that part of its output was subducted into the Tonga Trench; back-arc magmas may thus ended up entraining material formerly produced by the Rarotonga hotspot. Backarc volcanic rocks in the Lau Basin bear traces of such influence. * The Marshall Islands underwent vigorous volcanic and geological activity while they passed over the Rarotonga hotspot and neighbouring hotspots.  Geochemical traits and plate reconstruction links the Ralik Chain to the Rarotonga hotspot less than 80 million years ago.  Limalok guyot was close to the Rarotonga and Rurutu hotspots 62 million years ago. The plate reconstructions point towards Rurutu being the origin of Limalok, while geochemical traits match Rarotonga best.  Lo-En guyot was within the influence of the Rarotonga hotspot between 85 and 74 million years ago; if volcanic activity occurred during that time it may be owing to the effect of this hotspot. There is evidence of Campanian volcanic activity  Eniwetok was located close to the Rarotonga hotspot about 76.9 million years ago; this date corresponds to the a radiometric age obtained on the upper volcano.  A cluster of volcanoes close to Eniwetok and Ujlan may be the product of the Rarotonga hotspot.  Volcanic activity at W≈çdejebato coincides with a period where the Rarotonga hotspot, the Rurutu hotspot and the Tahiti hotspot were all three located close to the seamount. * Geochemical traits and plate reconstruction links the Magellan Seamounts to the Rarotonga hotspot less than 80 million years ago. * The Western Pacific Seamount Province has been argued to be the Cretaceous path of the Rarotonga hotspot, but its older members appear to be offset slightly north of the reconstructed path. Some seamounts on the reconstructed path of the Rarotonga hotspot share geochemical traits with the hotspot, but with different lead isotope ratios. * Hemler Guyot has similar isotope ratios as Rarotonga and its reconstructed position match those of the Rarotonga hotspot.

(also written Muslim Taher, , ; September 10, 1934 ‚Äì November 23, 1999) was an Indonesian educator who founded Jayabaya University on October 5, 1958. Taher was later appointed become 2nd rector of the Jayabaya University for the period 1962‚Äì1988 replacing Prof. Mr. S. A. Hakim as first rector. In addition, Taher was appointed by Soeharto as the Supreme Advisory Council of the Republic of Indonesia from 1983‚Äì1988. Biography =Early life= Sidi Moeslim bin Mohammad Taher was born in Sigli, Pidie Regency, Aceh as the fourth of seven children from a family of Arab- Minangkabau origin. His last name Taher (; ) is one of the Ba 'Alawi sada clans of Hadhrami Arab in Indonesia. His father was named Haji Sidi Mohammad Tahir who was a retired head of the pawnshop, while his mother was a Minangkabau woman named Nurcahya. In the Minangkabau custom, the honoric prefix Sidi in front of its name is an abbreviation of the arabic word Sayyidi (; \\"milord\\"). This title came from Pariaman, West Sumatra and was given to the son of an ulama who was still a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad who spread Islam in Pariaman and its surroundings. =Education= Moeslim Taher began his education at the elementary school level in Sigli and graduated in 1947. He then continued his junior and senior high school education in Padang and graduated in 1957. He obtained a law degree from the university he led, Jayabaya University in 1965. Three years later, he earned a bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Social and Politics, Padjadjaran University (Unpad). In Unpad he also became an extraordinary lecturer since 1978 and a year later earned a doctorate with cum laude. =Personal life= During his life, Moeslim Taher was married five times. His first marriage was with a woman of Hadhrami Arab descent named Nurtini binti Sjahboedin in 1962. From his marriage to Nurtini, Taher obtained a child named Agustian Putrajaya (born on August 30, 1963). In 1963, Taher remarried Yuyun Hindun. From his second marriage, he was blessed with seven children, including Mustar, Mulia, Rachmat, Yulia, Kurnia, Sartika, and Citasari. Aldiansyah Taher, an Indonesian actor, model, and singer is Taher's grandson from his second marriage. In 1965, Taher remarried a Batak girl named Rosemary Siagian but on December 22, 1965 they decided to divorce. From his marriage to Rosemary, Taher was blessed with a daughter named Dessy Musnilla. His fourth marriage was with Saleha Moeslim Taher in 1975. From his fourth marriage, Taher obtained six children, including Amri, Nurfitri, Firman, Moehamad Ichsan, Firdaus, and Rasyid. Meanwhile, Taher's last marriage was with Fatimah in 1984 and divorced that same year. From his marriage to Fatimah, he was blessed with a daughter named Sabrina. Of his five wives, only three accompanied Taher until the end of his life, they were Nurtini binti Sjahboedin, Yuyun Hindun, and Saleha Moeslim Taher. Career When he was in junior high school, throughout 1950‚Äì1952 he had taught elementary school in Padang. Subsequently, in 1954‚Äì1957 he had become a junior and senior high school teacher in Jakarta. A few years later he became director of a private high school and in 1959 he instead founded Jayabaya University, Jakarta. When first founded the University, he was 24 years old. This initiative seems to be a further development of his devotion to education, with a career that began when he became an elementary school caretaker, junior high school leader, and later high school leader. The experience in devotion in the field of education that later encouraged him to establish Jayabaya University. Other than that, Taher felt responsible for giving answers to the challenges faced by the Indonesian nation in the form of problems of lagging and backwardness in various fields. Understandably, when Jayabaya University was founded, Indonesia was only 13 years old and the number of universities was still few. At the beginning of its establishment, Jayabaya University began by managing two faculties, namely the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Economics with 11 students. Educational and administrative activities are carried out by borrowing a place at Private Schools at Jalan Salemba Raya 12, Central Jakarta. Classrooms in the morning and afternoon are used by elementary, junior high school, and senior high school students, therefore new lectures take place in the afternoon and evening, from 5 pm to 9 pm. Taher led Jayabaya University as rector in 1961 to replace Prof. Mr. S. A. Hakimm who led from 1959-1961, during that period, Taher held the position as vice-rector and secretary. In 1965, he obtained a law degree from the university he led. Three years later, he obtained a bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Social and Political Science, Padjadjaran University. In Unpad he also became an extraordinary lecturer since 1978 and a year later earned a doctorate with cum laude. Other activities As a rector of a private university, in 1980, Taher was appointed become general chairman of the Chancellor's Council of Private Universities and Institutes throughout Indonesia. A few years later he was appointed become president of the International Association of Universities for the Southeast Asia region. In addition, in the political realm Taher was appointed by Suharto as the Supreme Advisory Council of the Republic of Indonesia from 1983‚Äì1988. Publications Taher has written some books, among others are: * Sistem Pemerintahan Pancasila (Pancasila Government System), published by Nusa Bangsa in 1978 * Berdialog dengan Situasi untuk Membangun Hari Esok: Kumpulan Pidato Dies Natalis ke XIX s/d XXV Rektor Universitas Jayabaya (1977-1983) (Dialogue with the Situation to Build Tomorrow: A Collection of Speeches from the 19th to 27th Anniversary of the Rector of Jayabaya University (1977-1983)), published by Jayabaya Foundation in 1983 * Civitas Akademica Sumber Konsepsi Dinamika: untuk Melarutkan Nilai-nilai Budaya Kepada Generasi Penerus (Civitas Academica Source Conception of Dynamics: to Dissolve Cultural Values to the Next Generation), published by Jayabaya Foundation in 1983 * Iman, Ilmu & Amal Berlandaskan Kematangan Mental Spiritual: Kumpulan Karya Tulis, Ceramah, dan Khotbah Terpilih (Faith, Science & Charity Based on Spiritual Mental Maturity: A Collection of Written Work, Lectures, and Selected Sermons), published by Jayabaya Foundation in 1984 * Menemukan Suatu Sistem dengan Proses Perubahan Terpola (Finding a System with a Patterned Change Process), published by Jayabaya Foundation in 1984 * Menuju Perilaku Berlandaskan Nilai-nilai dan Moral Pancasila (Towards Behavior Based on Values and Morals of Pancasila), published by Jayabaya Foundation in 1984 Appreciation In June 2013, a book about the struggle of Moeslim Taher and his wife Yuyun Moeslim Taher (Yuyun Hindun) in developing the world of education by establishing Jayabaya University amid various limitations was launched.

The book, written by the Ukrainian scientist and martial arts researcher Oleg Maltsev and D'Amato's mentee Tom Patti, was published in the English language in 2018, which can be accessed by anybody free of charge, to preserve the legacy of Cus Damato.  The history of writing  The book Non-compromised Pendulum was preceded by the international project Science of Victory, dedicated to the memory of Cus D'Amato, coach of the three world boxing champions Jose Torres, Floyd Patterson and Mike Tyson. The marathon passed from 26 October 2017 to 4 November 2017. The project was attended by boxing champions, trainers, sports journalists, sports psychologists and martial arts experts from around the world who shared their thoughts on Casa D'Amato and his role in the history of professional boxing. The idea of the project and the writing of the book belongs to the Ukrainian scientist, candidate of psychological sciences, Oleg Maltsev, who studied the training system of D'Amato and the style of boxing he has created for more than 20 years. In order to test the results of the research and get information about the system, he began collaborating with D'Amato's student Tom Patti. In 2017 in New York, the authors completed the study and writing of the book.  Reception  The book is available for free in Russian and English languages. Overall Non-compromised Pendulum received favourable reviews from boxing scholars who knew D'Amato himself and/or researched his boxing style. A sports psychologist, former boxer and coach Alexander Balykin wrote in his review that the book should be read not only by coaches, but also by the athletes regardless of the sport they are doing. According to Alexander Balykin, the system of Cus D'Amato will be always relevant in all sports. He also notes the philosophical and psychological component in D'Amato's system. Although, he notes that by reading the \\"Non- compromised Pendulum\\" one will not become capable of using D'Amato's system. For a deeper understanding of Cus‚Äô methodology in practice it is necessary to train with a professional coach and study additional methodological manuals. Dr. Antonio Graceffo compares the Non-compromised Pendulum with the Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi and with the treatise Art of War by Sun Tzu. Graceffo noted the concept \\"2 + 3 = 5\\" and its practical aspects in and out of the ring. The number \\"2\\" of the equation means a duel between a coach and student, by means of which the coach gains authority in the eyes of his mentee. Graceffo emphasized that while Cus D‚ÄôAmato was able to subordinate and \\"defeat\\" Mike Tyson, he did not damage his personality. In his words the book is meant to develop a non-compromised approach and mind-set. NY Fights journalist John Gatling notes that the view of Non-compromised Pendulum is somewhere in the middle between what Muhammed Ali thought of Cus ‚Äì the devil and what Mike Tyson of him ‚Äì the God. John considers the book to be an elaborate psychological course into Cus D‚ÄôAmato's approach in training and developing a lifestyle of a true champion. Boxing historian, founder of Boxing Hall of Fame, Inc (Las Vegas, Nevada) Steve Lott reviewed the book stating that the piece is something which was never done in the history of boxing. In his words, Cus would be impressed that the author understood that 80% of boxing was mental and emotional, with the physical being a small part. However at same time Steve notes that the book is way above the level of average boxing readers and the concepts might be too advanced to comprehend. Martin Gonz√°lez a trainer at United States Boxing Association praised the analysis of the technical elements of style and an approach in studying mental processes and psychology. According to Martin Gonzalez, he himself used the style of Cus D'Amato in training boxing fighters. The president of the National League of Professional Boxing of Ukraine, , generally praised the book. However, he is ready to argue with a fragment of the book where it is said that without the instinct of the killer a boxer will not become king in the ring. In contrast, he refers to the current boxers Vasily Lomachenko and Oleksandr Usyk, who in his opinion, do not possess the killer instinct. The journalist of The Ring Lee Groves, examining the structure of the book, also noted its depth. Sports Illustrated review by Kaelen Jones states that Non-compromised Pendulum serves as a short and concise testament of authors‚Äô commitment to adequately portray Cus D‚ÄôAmato. The review includes authors‚Äô quotes and striking ideas of certain chapters of the book, saying that it is an unconventional read with myriad lessons throughout it. It also points out the fact while D‚ÄôAmato is remembered as one of the most influential boxing trainers, his doctrines were taught in secret and mostly unknown.  Content  The book comprehensively describes D'Amato's system based on two decades long scientific research. Authors claim that D'Amato's system is applicable in and out of the ring. Different chapters of the book explain the genius of D'Amato and his psychological, philosophical and methodological approach of bringing up a champion. In the frameworks of the research, the scientific expedition was held in the homeland of D'Amato, Southern Italy.

She was described as great asset to the Company, as she knew at least 35 contemporary roles. She performed Shakespeare-heroines such as Juliet, Ophelia and Lady Macbeth.

She was greatly admired for her beauty, voice and dramatic ability. In 1769, she married David Carnegie, Lord Rosehill (d. 1788) and acquired the name 'Lady Rosehill'. History of the American Theatre: Before the Revolution In Burke's Peerage, the marriage is dated to 1768 and the bride is name 'Catherine Cameron', which may indikate that 'Margaret Cheer' was in fact her stage name.History of the American Theatre: Before the Revolution In contrast to what would have been expected by contemporary norms, she did not retire from stage after her marriage. Her career does seem to have become more irregular after her marriage, however, and Nancy Hallam replaced her as leading lady. After her marriage, she became known under the stage name 'Mrs. Long'.

It has since been converted into offices and flats, and has been a Grade II listed building since 21 January 1952. Architecture The three- storey buildings have stuccoed brick at the front and sides, whilst the back is plain brick. The roofs consist of slate tiles and a large chimney stack with multiple chimneys. All the buildings are set back from the street with small gardens at the front. At the back they have extensions in varying sizes, and a couple of the buildings have small back gardens. All of them have semi- basements with small street level windows. The entrance of number 12 is set back from the rest of the buildings and number 15 protrudes forward slightly more than the others. At the front the basement and ground floors are styled with continuous rustication, which can be seen as a painted brick effect. The ground and first floors are separated by a continuous concrete band. From the first floor upwards the walls are stuccoed with embedded pillars separating each building topped with a square capital. The pillars support the coped parapet roof. In front of the entrance to each doorway is a flight of stone steps, with wrought iron railings. The doorways of 13‚Äì18 are recessed slightly and have semi-circular arched tops, which are filled with decorated metal fanlights.

It was built from 1814 to 1827. It is also known as Weatherboard Inn Archaeological Site. The property is owned by the Blue Mountains City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  First settlement in the area was initiated by William Cox during his road construction programme over the Blue Mountains to the Western Plains. In the immediate vicinity to the Inn site, in 1814, William Cox's second depot had been established on this site - the original weatherboard hut, built by convicts Cox had build the road over the Blue Mountains. Cox chose a site for this hut close to a stream \\"of excellent water\\". The depot was built between 1/10/1814-8/10/1814. 'The situation is very pleasant, being a ridge high enough in the front (which is due east) to overlook the standing timber altogether, and at the back there is a considerable quantity of ground without a tree, and a rivulet of fine spring water running through it. On this ground there is the grass tree and other coarse food, which the bullocks eat and fill themselves pretty well.'Wm.Cox, 1815 journal, cited in Mackaness, p.42 'The building is x with sides, the whole weatherboarded; gable ended weatherboards and with a door on the east end (it)cost me eight men, ten days'. This would appear to have been the first colonial building in what later became Wentworth Falls. This hut was for some time a military post with a small detachment of nine soldiers and later six mounted police were stationed there. Between 1814-1822 it was used as a dining room by travellers, and the site was used as a camping ground. Between the mid 1810s and 1855 the area (now Pitt Park) was used for camping and stock feeding. The area (from the present Coronation Park to Pitt Park) was used as a military camp/depot/post/lockup and stockade/site of military and police activities. The hut evolved into a staging post for long westward journeys - Governor Macquarie used it on his journey to Bathurst in April‚ÄìMay 1815. It became known as a place where travelling stock could find fodder and its name of \\"the weatherboard hut\\" was shortened to \\"weatherboard\\", this even being used in official papers. The hut appears to have burnt down by . The area was long used for camping and stock feeding. In June 1826 Governor Darling received a request from John Mills for a small land grant in the area called the \\"weatherboad hut\\", to build an inn. He was granted one hundred acres conditional on the type of building he would build, with a liquor license for 3 years free of duty payments, and 400 acres of more fertile land elsewhere. The Weatherboard Inn itself appears to have begun construction shortly before 1827. By 1829 Mills reported he had completed construction of a substantial dwelling place, consisting of two sitting rooms, six bedrooms, a seven stall stable, sheepfold, a paddock for horned cattle and horses and other outbuildings. Mills was granted by Governor Darling (portion 11, Parish of Jamison, County of Cook) in 1829, the same year he completed the Inn. By June 1829 Mill's establishment and the were sold at public auction to satisfy debts. The new owner was Alexander Fraser, who stated that he finished the construction of the inn and demanded the additional promised to Mills. Following some wrangling the land was eventually given to George Innes who had financed Mills in erecting the inn.Thorpe 1998 After the final settlement the inn passed through a number of hands, both owners and licensees. In 1833 the first license was issued and the Inn named \\"The Bathurst Traveller\\". Fraser sold the inn to William Boyles, who held it \\"at least from 1835 until his death in 1842.\\" In 1836 English naturalist Charles Darwin stayed at the Inn.Thorpe, 1998 At the time Darwin was on board HMS Beagle making a world tour under Captain Fitzroy, mapping latitudes. Darwin was 26. He lunched at the Weatherboard Inn on his way west to Bathurst in January 1836, sidetracked along what is now called the Charles Darwin Walk to view the Jamison Valley. On his return trip from Bathurst to Sydney, Darwin stayed again three nights, during which time he again walked to admire the view from the top of the Wentworth Falls.Nicholas, 2008, 10 An 1839 advertisement for the Inn's lease noted \\"a large establishment, including 3 parlours, 7 bedrooms, kitchen, taproom, bar, stores and stabling for 17 horses, as well as a large and well stocked garden, furniture and stock'. Descriptions of 1839 indicate a large and successful operation, famous as \\"the weatherboard inn\\", with three parlours, seven bedrooms, kitchen, taproom and bar, stores and suitable stabling for 17 horses, and a large and well stocked garden. The inn was a stage for early coach lines including Cobb & Co. In 1840 the inn was purchased by William Boyles and willed to his daughter in 1842. That same year she married Edward Dougherty, and the estate remained with them until 1896. In 1847 it was renamed \\"the Weatherboard Inn\\". In 1855 the military camp/depot/lockup was moved/ transferred to 18 Mile Hollow (Woodford). With the coming of the railway line (an 1862 railway survey plan showed the inn; the railway line to Weatherboard opened in 1867, and the line to Mount Victoria opened in 1868) and subsequent decline in road traffic the Inn appears to have gone out of business. There is some possibility that the inn may have subsequently been occupied by a C. A. Wilson while he established an accommodation house near the railway platform, or that it was used as additional accommodation to this building, but this is speculative at best. After 1867 the Inn's history is obscure, it is not even certain when or how the buildings were destroyed or demolished. In 1877 George Matcham Pitt acquired nearby land, and in 1888 he conveyed the acreage to his son, Robert Matcham Pitt. It was not until 1879 that certain features (e.g.: the \\"weatherboard\\" railway, post office etc.) were renamed \\"Wentworth Falls\\".From archaeological investigation in 1985 it appears that part of the inn was destroyed by fire in the later 19th century. In 1889 Coorah was built. The inn was purchased by Robert Jones in 1894. In 1896 the land was bought by a Mr Pitt who, earlier had established a home and gardens in the near vicinity. He commenced damming part of the creek to allow water supply to his gardens. That same year the town's name was officially changed to Wentworth Falls. In 1914 the land began to be subdivided. Mrs Marie Pitt gave the lot on which the School of Arts now stands to the Trustees of the Wentworth Falls Literary Institute, and other portions were given to her daughters. In 1934 Mr R. M. Pitt gave one lot (#5) (10 acres, 1 rood, 17 perch) to the Blue Mountains City Council for dedication as parkland. In 1935 the land that became Pitt Park was donated to Council for public use in 1935 (possibly under the terms of the will of RM Pitt). These were the primary portions containing the old inn site. The park was named Pitt Park. Parts of it were developed as sports fields. The remainder of the grant for the inn, south of the railway, is gradually being acquired by Blue Mountains City Council for open space. In 1936 the Naturalist Society planted an evergreen/holm/holly oak (Quercus ilex) on the site, to commemorate the centenary of the visit and stay in the inn of English naturalist, Charles Darwin. This tree is separately recognised on the Blue Mountains Register of Significant Trees. Adjoining lots (6 & 7) which had passed into the hands of Mrs Effie Mathews and Mrs S. A. Smith were also given to Council to incorporate into the park, \\"for the purposes of recreation\\". These were three separate land owners (donating land), two of whom's land being the primary portions containing the old inn site. In 1940 Effie Matthews agreed to convey to Council in fee simple 4 acres, 33 perches being portion 6 of William Boyle's 100 acre grant (portion 11) Parish of Jamison, County of Cook. That same year Murial Smith agreed to convey to Council in fee simple also. The park was named Pitt Park, after Robert Matcham Pitt (1849-1935). The land containing the remains is now part of Pitt Park, a Council owned park. In 1952 the Blue Mountains Historical Society unveiled a bronze plaque attached to a large stone as a memorial to the \\"weatherboard\\" on the site. It appears that by 1967 this plaque had been stolen, as were others in the Blue Mountains. BMHS requested that Council fence the site to protect it, and Council declining, the BMHS removed the stone to the grounds of its museum. A concrete slab remains on site in which the stone had formerly been set. In 1985 the site came to the Heritage Council's attention when Blue Mountains City Council began removing gravel from Pitt Park to use in road building, when workers uncovered sandstone blocks and bricks. Further work resulted in the uncovering of artefacts including bricks, coins, bottles, a clay pipe, crockery and a bobbin commemorating Queen Victoria's coronation in 1830. Work ceased and an archaeological excavation was undertaken along with historical study. Finding the site significant, sand was dumped on it to cap the remains and protect them from weathering and vandalism.Thorp, 1985  Description  An archaeological site within Pitt Park, Matcham Avenue, Wentworth Falls, containing remains of a former (1827) inn, former Cox's depot ( weatherboard hut). Site also contains a 1936 memorial tree, a holm/evergreen/holly oak (Quercus ilex), planted by the Naturalist Society of NSW in 1936 to commemorate the visit and stay in the Inn in 1836 of British naturalist Charles Darwin. = Modifications and dates = *1985 excavation by BMCC for gravel deposits.  Heritage listing  As at 30 December 2003, this site has considerable local, regional and national significance exemplifying the reasons for the development of the Blue Mountains area and as part of the great outward expansion of the colony during the early decades of the 19th century. The site has strong associations with significant historical figures such as Charles Darwin and assistant surveyors Govett and Hay. It exemplifies a strong social factor of the early colony; the transitory state of the population between home, work and institutional places requiring rest stops such as this former inn. There is strong scientific and research potential in this site if significant sections of the original and developed inn complex are still intact. Building techniques and materials from an early period of the colony's development, local technical variations and materials exploitation, dependence on Sydney supplies and the organisation of a large inn site are all research themes that could be explored Much of the place now known as Pitt Park was cleared in the mid-late 1810s and used as a camping area and stockade by the military and travellers. This place, along with an area from Wentworth Falls Railway Station, through Coronation Park and the shopping centre, played an integral role in the colonisation of NSW, particularly in the development of the road across the Blue Mountains to the west. The place was also crucial in the development of the location of Wentworth Falls. From the time William Cox established a depot in 1814 just to the east of what is now Pitt Park, the place became the nucleus of what was to become the town of Wentworth Falls. The depot was close to the current location of the railway station, and the swamp to the west became a feedlot for stock, and the surrounding grounds a camping area. The Weatherboard Inn was subsequently established on the west side of the swamp in the late 1820s and the surrounding area was used as a military depot and camping area for another 30‚Äì40 years. Half of Pitt Park is now a significant recreation area, and Pitt Park is an important community resource for residents and visitors.

It ran for six seasons on CBS from September 17, 1965, to April 4, 1971. Main =Colonel Hogan= Bob Crane as Colonel Hogan Colonel Robert E. Hogan (portrayed by Bob Crane) ‚Äì United States Army Air Corp Colonel Robert E. Hogan, senior ranking POW officer, is the leader of the group. Hogan commanded the 504th Bombardment Group prior to being shot down during a raid on Hamburg when Luftwaffe Colonel Albert Biedenbender (James Gregory) guessed Hogan's plan and developed a successful defense. Hogan graduated third in his military class, and seems to thrive on difficult if not impossible missions. He was described by Biedenbender as having \\"a flair for the overcomplex\\" because of the complicated details of the missions he plans. Due to Hogan's care in planning operations, the skill of his staff, and Hogan's success at manipulating Klink and Schultz, Hogan's team is usually successful. He is a ladies' man, engaging in different relationships with Klink's secretaries (Helga and Hilda) and most of the civilian women he comes in contact with. Throughout the show, Hogan is seen impersonating German officers, typically using aliases derived from his own name such as \\"Hoganm√ºller\\" or \\"Hoganschmidt\\". Hogan's men are extremely loyal to their commander, and he to them. In \\"Two Nazis for the Price of One\\", Hogan and his men are ordered back to London after they discover their operation is known by a Gestapo general. When circumstances force Hogan to stay behind, the men all elect to remain with him, which visibly touches Hogan. Newkirk once disobeyed orders and explained the team's activities to an Allied general who was unaware of Hogan's real mission and chastised him for appearing to cooperate with the Nazis, with Newkirk telling the general he should \\"know how we all feel about Colonel Hogan\\" (\\"The General Swap\\"). When a British general praised Hogan's war efforts, Hogan was quick to state that he \\"has a good crew\\", crediting the men with the team's successes (\\"D-Day at Stalag 13\\"). =Colonel Klink= Werner Klemperer as Col. Klink Colonel Wilhelm Klink (portrayed by Werner Klemperer) ‚Äì Kommandant Oberst (Colonel) Wilhelm Klink is an old-line Luftwaffe officer of aristocratic (Junker) Prussian descent. He is shown to be inept, gullible, cowardly, overconfident, paranoid, insecure, and often clueless. He is a veteran aviator of the First World War and can be seen wearing an Iron Cross First Class, along with the 1939 clasp for a second award (spange), Ground Assault Badge of the Luftwaffe, and the Pilot's Badge. The former implies that he also earned both an Iron Cross Second Class as well as the Honor Cross for service in World War I. After failing his entrance exams for law or medical school, he received an appointment to a military academy and graduated 95th in his class. Stuck at the rank of colonel for twenty years with an efficiency rating a few points above \\"miserable\\", he is the only member of his class still in uniform who has not become a general. Klink always wears a monocle on his left eye, usually carries a riding crop, and walks with a stoop. Klink is for the most part portrayed as a vain, muddling, and incompetent career officer rather than as an evil German or ardent Nazi. Klink is easily manipulated by Hogan through a combination of flattery, chicanery, and playing on Klink's fear of being sent to the Russian Front or being arrested by the Gestapo. Klemperer reprised his role as Colonel Klink outside of the series twice: once on the 1960s Batman series in a cameo role and in a 1993 episode of The Simpsons. =Sergeant Schultz= John Banner as Schultz Sergeant Hans Schultz (portrayed by John Banner) ‚Äì Oberfeldwebel (During World War II the equivalent to Master Sergeant) Hans Schultz is Klink's portly, inept, clumsy, dim-witted, yet affable Sergeant of the Guard. He displays two stripes at the cuffs of his tunic sleeves indicating the rank of Hauptfeldwebel, which is the equivalent of a Company First Sergeant with the same pay grade as Oberfeldwebel; he wears a fictitious version of the Iron Cross (4th Grade). Schultz also has three other decorations from World War I (including the Wound Badge). Schultz is seen throughout the show taking bribes from the prisoners that are usually in the form of chocolate bars or LeBeau's gourmet cooking, often in exchange for information. Schultz tries to avoid trouble at all costs and prefers to ignore the prisoners' suspicious activities. His catchphrase is \\"I know (see) nothing!\\"https://www.triviamemo.com/article/on-the-tv-show-hogan-s-heroes- what-is-sergeant-schultz-s-catchphrase/ Schultz's penchant for disregarding the prisoners' antics is so great, Hogan and his men can usually rely on Schultz to keep his mouth shut and often will openly discuss their latest plot in his presence. Frequently, they will even tell Schultz directly what they are up to and enlist his help or participation in their schemes from time to time, usually amid his protestations. Schultz often seems to be more sympathetic to the allies (\\"Once in awhile I have to be on our side!\\") than to the Germans. On several occasions, Schulz mentions how disgusted he is by the war and Hitler's rule and much preferred the days when Germany was led by the Kaiser. Like Colonel Klink, Schultz is a veteran of World War I and in civilian life was the owner of Germany's largest and most successful toy manufacturing company. He has a wife and five children, whom he sees only on infrequent leaves. He is unfaithful, however, as he is seen dating women from the nearby town of Hammelburg who often turn out to be underground agents assisting Hogan and his men. Schultz is a bad gambler and possibly alcoholic, but above all loves to eat, particularly LeBeau's exquisite cooking. Schultz carries a Krag-J√∏rgensen rifle, which he never keeps loaded and tends to misplace or even hand to the POWs when he's distracted. =Corporal LeBeau= Robert Clary as LeBeau and Cynthia Lynn as Fr√§ulein Helga Corporal Louis LeBeau (portrayed by Robert Clary) ‚Äì Free French Air Force Corporal Louis LeBeau is a Master Chef and occasionally a tailor, he is also one of the first POWs at Stalag 13. He is passionate about his cooking and patriotism for France, and he often spites Germans and Nazis when they commit war crimes. LeBeau makes uniforms for the prisoners smuggled through their tunnels, and helps with disguising Hogan's men in Nazi apparel. LeBeau has trained the camp guard dogs without the knowledge of the guards, and is often seen using the tunnel entrance located in the kennel. Though highly claustrophobic, he is used during missions to hide in small spaces such as the safe in Colonel Klink's office, boxes, crates, or a dumbwaiter. LeBeau also uses his talent as a singer to help the \\"Heroes\\" in several episodes. In one first-season episode, LeBeau refers to being married. Except for that one instance, he appears as a stereotypical Frenchman, attracted to many of the women with whom he comes in contact during the series. LeBeau frequently uses his culinary skills to impress Klink's guests or get him out of trouble with his superiors. Hogan also uses LeBeau's culinary prowess to gain access to Klink's guests at dinners or banquets, or to bargain for extra privileges. LeBeau is frequently seen bribing Schultz with food for information. Both Schultz and Klink frequently refer to LeBeau as \\"the cockroach\\", due to his small stature. Actor Robert Clary is a French Jew who had been held in the Nazi concentration camps Ottmuth and Buchenwald, and still has his serial number tattooed on his arm. =Corporal Newkirk= Richard Dawson as Newkirk alongside guest star Ulla Str√∂mstedt Corporal Peter Newkirk (portrayed by Richard Dawson) ‚Äì Royal Air Force Corporal Peter Newkirk is the group's conman. As a skilled tailor, Newkirk is in charge of making or altering uniforms, civilian clothes, and other disguises as needed for missions or for prisoners to move out of Germany. He also uses his skills as a pick-pocket, lock picker and safe cracker on many occasions, particularly to open Klink's office safe. As a card sharp, Newkirk gambles with Schultz to learn about top secret information, and is often teamed with Carter in operations. Newkirk does numerous impersonations such as vaudeville personalities; he can impersonate German officers and is able to do a voice imitation of Adolf Hitler; he is shown imitating Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister. As a bit of a Casanova, Newkirk is often seen trying to initiate romance with the women who appear in the series. =Sergeant Kinchloe= Ivan Dixon as Kinchloe, talking to Hogan Staff Sergeant James Kinchloe (portrayed by Ivan Dixon) ‚Äì United States Army Air Corp Staff Sergeant James \\"Kinch\\" Kinchloe is primarily responsible for radio, telephone, and other forms of electronic communications. Although outranked by TSgt. Carter, Kinch acts as second in command in Hogan's crew and is Chief of Operations. It was a large step for a 1960s television show to have an African-American actor identified in such a manner. A talented mimic, Kinchloe easily imitates German officers speaking over the radio or telephone. Kinch is from Detroit, where he had worked for the telephone company and before the war fought in the Golden Gloves boxing matches as a middleweight. Kinchloe has remarkable ability when participating in undercover activities, but because of his skin color his roles outside of the camp are limited. Ivan Dixon left the series after the end of the fifth season; no mention was ever made on-screen regarding Kinchloe's departure from Stalag 13. =Sergeant Baker= Sergeant Richard Baker (portrayed by Kenneth Washington) ‚Äì Following Dixon's departure from the show after season five, the series producers chose to create a new character rather than recast the part of Kinchloe. Sergeant Richard Baker, like Kinchloe, was an African-American radio expert who ran the underground communications center. However, with Kinchloe's departure, Newkirk is elevated to the Chief of Operations/Chief of Staff role (despite being subordinate to both Sergeant Baker and TSgt. Carter by rank) during the sixth season. As with Kinchloe, Baker is able to contribute vital support to the missions assigned to him by Col. Hogan. =Sergeant Carter= Larry Hovis as Sgt Carter Technical Sergeant Andrew Carter (portrayed by Larry Hovis) ‚Äì United States Army Air Corps Technical Sergeant Andrew J. Carter is a chemist and an explosives expert in charge of ordnance and bomb-making. Prior to the war, Carter was a Boy Scout who had run a drug store in Muncie, Indiana. In the pilot episode, \\"The Informer\\", Carter has the rank of first lieutenant, and is an escapee from another POW camp who swaps places with the \\"outside man\\", Olsen, while temporarily being brought into Stalag 13. In the series, Carter shows a great talent in chemistry and explosives; he has a passion for making and producing formulas, chemicals, and explosive devices when needed. While bright and enthusiastic at his specialties, he is often clumsy and forgetful. Carter is often called upon to impersonate German officers, most convincingly, Adolf Hitler, to whom he bears more than a passing resemblance. Carter sometimes references his fianc√©e Mary Jane, whom he expects to marry after the war. Unlike the rest of the men, he is shown to be shy around women, and Newkirk and LeBeau often joke about his na√Øvet√©. Although Carter is the ranking non-commissioned officer, he is never shown to exercise any real authority over the other prisoners. He is part Native American, as revealed when he receives a letter from one of his Sioux relatives. (In reality, Hovis was born on a Yakama reservation in Washington.) Recurring Sigrid Valdis as Fr√§ulein Hilda with Crane as Hogan *Fr√§ulein Helga (portrayed by Cynthia Lynn from 1965 to 1966) and Fr√§ulein Hilda (portrayed by Sigrid Valdis from 1966 to 1971) ‚Äì Helga and Hilda served as Colonel Klink's secretary. Both were portrayed as neutral or pro-Allied in that they assisted Hogan and his men when not working for Klink, and had flirtatious personal relationships with Colonel Hogan. Both assist Hogan by providing general information or access to official papers and equipment. They also often provide verification for Hogan's statements when he tries to manipulate Klink, such as agreeing that Klink looks tired or sick. In addition, visiting dignitaries often attempt to flirt with Helga and Hilda, including invitations (or summonses) to dinner, which often aids Hogan and his men to create distractions, steal documents, or secretly make personal contact. In the pilot episode, Helga works as a manicurist in the prisoners' underground barber shop, but this is the only scene that shows her cooperation as that extensive. Sigrid Valdis appeared as a different character in one episode before obtaining the role of Hilda. She and Bob Crane were married on the show's set in 1970. Most of the cast and crew were present, and Richard Dawson served as Crane's best man. *General Albert Hans Burkhalter (portrayed by Leon Askin) ‚Äì General Albert Burkhalter is Klink's gruff and rotund Wehrmacht Heer superior officer. His rank is equivalent to a lieutenant (three-star) general in the American forces. Burkhalter frequently tires of Klink's obsequious manner and nervous babbling (\\"Shut up Klink!\\") and regularly threatens to send him to the Russian Front or have him shot. Burkhalter is mystified by Stalag 13's perfect record, unable to make sense of it in contrast with Klink's apparent incompetence. However, Burkhalter, is sometimes shown to be a somewhat incompetent general himself. He is deathly afraid of his wife, and after Hogan manages to get photos of the General with other women in order to blackmail him, Burkhalter frantically agrees to do whatever is necessary to save his reputation. Like Klink, Burkhalter comes to depend on Hogan's explanations to get him out of trouble with the High Command when Hogan's schemes result in German failures. *Major Wolfgang Hochstetter (portrayed by Howard Caine) ‚Äì Major (Sturmbannf√ºhrer) Wolfgang Hochstetter of the Gestapo often takes it upon himself to investigate Klink and Stalag 13, or receives orders to do so. Because he is Gestapo, Klink is clearly fearful of him, while Burkhalter, who openly despises Hochstetter, is not. Though Hochstetter is highly suspicious of Hogan and has come to regard him as \\"the most dangerous man in all Germany\\", his arogance tends to get the better of him as he fails to see how he himself is manipulated by Hogan; Just like Klink and Burkhalter, whenever a Hogan scheme results in another German disaster, Hochstetter always accepts Hogan's advice about what to tell Berlin in order to save his own neck. Before becoming settled into the Hochstetter role, Caine played two other similar German officers, Gestapo Kriminaldirektor (Colonel) Feldkamp and Major Keitel. Bernard Fox as Colonel Crittendon, alongside Klemperer as Klink *Colonel Rodney Crittendon (portrayed by Bernard Fox) ‚Äì Colonel Rodney Crittendon is a Royal Air Force group captain. (American forces have no \\"group captain\\" rank, so Crittendon was referred to as \\"colonel\\" to eliminate confusion for the show's US audience.) He is a British officer who comes into contact with Hogan and his men several times throughout the series. His date of rank is earlier than Hogan's, and as senior officer he occasionally attempts to assume command. His medals include the Distinguished Service Order, Order of the British Empire, Military Cross and Bar, and the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar. He believes that a POW's only duty is to escape; to be involved in anything else, such as spying or sabotage, is strictly against regulations. Crittendon is shown to be amateurish and oblivious to Hogan's operation, much to Hogan's annoyance. When Crittendon first transferred from Stalag 18, Hogan posed him a hypothetical question, asking what he would do if he were aware the POWs were engaged in spying and sabotage; Crittendon replied that he would report them to the German authorities. Crittendon constantly tries to develop and attempt escapes, however they ultimately fail due to poor planning. In a dual role, Bernard Fox played British traitor Sir Charles Chitterly (possibly a parody of William Joyce known as Lord Haw-Haw), who stops at Stalag 13 with his wife Lady Leslie Chitterly (Anne Rogers), while on their way to visit Adolf Hitler, whom they consider a friend. Lookalike Crittendon is parachuted into camp, and replaces Sir Charles. *Marya (Nita Talbot) ‚Äì Marya is a Russian spy who occasionally works with Hogan. She often appears as the trusted paramour of a high-ranking German officer or scientist. Her mission is to either discredit them or set them up for arrest, as she notes that \\"...We cannot trust Hitler to shoot all his own generals\\". She meets Hogan and LeBeau in Paris during the second season, where she learns of their Stalag 13 activities. Her schemes often come into conflict with Hogan's plans, but she always proves to be either faithful to the Allied cause or have a compatible cause of her own. Marya constantly flirts with Hogan, to his discomfort, and also flirts with LeBeau. Infatuated, LeBeau trusts her and believes her to be an innocent, decent woman who won't sell out to the Nazis, though Hogan is always wary of her and suspicious of her motives. *Tiger (portrayed by Arlene Martel) ‚Äì Tiger is a French Underground contact who has several encounters with Hogan. Hogan notes that Tiger has saved his life at least once; He describes her as 'the' leader of the French Underground. Hogan frees Tiger from the Gestapo twice: once on the way to Berlin by train, and once from Gestapo headquarters in Paris. *Captain Fritz or Felix Gruber (portrayed by Dick Wilson) ‚Äì Captain Gruber is Klink's adjutant in \\"Don't Forget to Write\\", and becomes the new ruthless Kommandant of Stalag 13 after Klink mistakenly volunteers for the Russian Front. Because Gruber is hard-nosed and not easy to manipulate, the prisoners desperately want to get Klink back. Hogan orders three prisoners to escape and hide. When Gruber is unable to recapture them, Burkhalter orders Klink to find them, which he does with Hogan's aid. Burkhalter decides it would be a mistake to send Klink to the Russian Front and restores him to the Kommandant's position. In addition to Gruber, several other junior officers and capable NCO's are occasionally assigned to Klink's command, but Hogan always finds a way to get rid of them. *Corporal Karl Langenscheidt (portrayed by Jon Cedar) ‚Äì Corporal Karl Langenscheidt is one of Schultz's guards who is only seen or spoken of occasionally (mostly in the first-season episodes). He often arrives with poor timing, such as informing Klink that an important guest has arrived unannounced, much to Klink's displeasure. In \\"Art for Hogan's Sake\\", Langenscheidt gets involved in Hogan's scheme to forge the famous, priceless √âdouard Manet painting, \\"The Fife Player\\", and switch it for the real one General Burkhalter had \\"requisitioned\\" from the Louvre in Paris to give to Hermann G√∂ring as a birthday present. *Frau Gertrude Linkmeyer (n√©e Burkhalter) (portrayed by Kathleen Freeman, played once by Alice Ghostley) ‚Äì Frau Gertrude Linkmeyer is General Burkhalter's gruff, homely and possibly widowed sister. She is usually in a one-sided relationship with Klink, who does not return her affection. Her previous husband, Otto, is missing in action on the Russian Front, this leads General Burkhalter to arrange meetings between her and Klink in order to marry her off. Later in the series (\\"Kommandant Gertrude\\"), Frau Linkmeyer arrives at the camp with her new (and reluctant) fianc√©, Major Wolfgang Karp (Lee Bergere), whom she intends to have replace Klink as Kommandant, but Hogan manages to foil her plans and their engagement. *Maurice Dubois/Dubay (portrayed by Felice Orlandi) ‚Äì Maurice Dubois is a French Underground contact who appeared in several episodes. (Orlandi's real-life wife, Alice Ghostley, appeared in two episodes.) Hogan tries to convince Italian Major Bonacelli (Hans Conried) to help him. *Major Bonacelli (portrayed by Hans Conried in the first appearance, Vito Scotti in the second appearance) ‚Äì Major Bonacelli is a visiting commander of an Italian prisoner-of-war camp who is at Stalag 13 to learn Klink's techniques. In \\"The Pizza Parlor\\", he is not supportive of the Fascist war effort and attempts to desert to Switzerland. Instead, Hogan convinces him to act as an Allied spy at the Italian POW camp. In \\"The Return of Major Bonacelli\\", Hogan talks Bonacelli into photographing the new advanced German anti-aircraft gun before defecting to England (while he is pursued by Hochstetter and the Gestapo). *Oscar Schnitzer (portrayed by Walter Janowitz) is an elderly veterinarian and dog trainer who keeps Stalag 13 supplied with guard dogs. He is a member of the German underground, and secretly in league with Hogan and his men. Oscar's truck is also occasionally used for smuggling people in and out of camp, as the guards are afraid of the dogs. *Olsen (portrayed by Stewart Moss or William Christopher) is the Heroes' \\"outside man\\"; when someone is brought into the camp, Olsen goes out to ensure that the number of prisoners remains the same. In the pilot episode \\"The Informer,\\" Carter asks Hogan what Olsen does while he's out of the camp, and Hogan says, \\"We never ask him.\\" In the episode \\"Some of Their Planes Are Missing,\\" Olsen takes Hogan's place in a bed, pretending to be asleep, so that the Germans wouldn't know that Hogan was out of the camp.

It defines a multiplicative homomorphism from the set of invertible operators to the set of positive real numbers. The Fuglede‚àíKadison determinant of an operator A is often denoted by \\\\Delta(A). For a matrix A in M_n(\\\\mathbb{C}), \\\\Delta(A) = \\\\left \\\\det (A) \\\\right^{1/n} which is the normalized form of the absolute value of the determinant of A. Definition Let \\\\mathcal{M} be a finite factor with the canonical normalized trace \\\\tau and let X be an invertible operator in \\\\mathcal{M}. Then the Fuglede‚àíKadison determinant of X is defined as :\\\\Delta(X) := \\\\exp \\\\tau(\\\\log (X^*X)^{1/2}), (cf. Relation between determinant and trace via eigenvalues). The number \\\\Delta(X) is well-defined by continuous functional calculus. Properties * \\\\Delta(XY) = \\\\Delta(X) \\\\Delta(Y) for invertible operators X, Y \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M}, * \\\\Delta (\\\\exp A) = \\\\left \\\\exp \\\\tau(A) \\\\right = \\\\exp \\\\Re \\\\tau(A) for A \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M}. * \\\\Delta is norm-continuous on GL_1(\\\\mathcal{M}), the set of invertible operators in \\\\mathcal{M}, * \\\\Delta(X) does not exceed the spectral radius of X. Extensions to singular operators There are many possible extensions of the Fuglede‚àíKadison determinant to singular operators in \\\\mathcal{M}. All of them must assign a value of 0 to operators with non-trivial nullspace. No extension of the determinant \\\\Delta from the invertible operators to all operators in \\\\mathcal{M}, is continuous in the uniform topology. =Algebraic extension= The algebraic extension of \\\\Delta assigns a value of 0 to a singular operator in \\\\mathcal{M}. =Analytic extension= For an operator A in \\\\mathcal{M}, the analytic extension of \\\\Delta uses the spectral decomposition of A = \\\\int \\\\lambda \\\\; dE_\\\\lambda to define \\\\Delta(A) := \\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\int \\\\log \\\\lambda \\\\; d\\\\tau(E_\\\\lambda) \\\\right) with the understanding that \\\\Delta(A) = 0 if \\\\int \\\\log \\\\lambda \\\\; d\\\\tau(E_\\\\lambda) = -\\\\infty.

He succeeded his throne after the death of his cousin, Sultan Shahabuddin Riayat Shah, in 1851. During his reign, he was involved in a civil war with Raja Muda Ngah Jaafar, who escaped Sultan Abdullah I his palace in Durian Sebatang and sought refuge in the residences of Datuk Laksamana Tok Janggut's residence. With Sultan Abdullah I in exile, King Ngah Jaafar was appointed as the de facto Perak Sultan by the influential Malay ruler who sided with Sultan Abdullah in 1853. [E.A. Blundell], the British Governor of the Straits Settlements, was informed of this by King Ngah Jaafar, who in turn was then presented to the British presence in India. Raja Lop Yusuf, the eldest son of Sultan Abdullah I, tried to persuade the Malay leaders to continue their support to his father but failed. Sultan Abdullah I wrote to Blundell about the crisis in Perak on 23 November 1855, and also to seek help from the British. However, the request was rejected on the grounds that the British had promised not to intervene in Perak's internal affairs.

In 2018 the IRC has members from these countries: Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Ukraine. Not all national communities have nominated new members to replace deceased representatives.  Organization  The IRC has an elected President and is registered as an association in Paris. At the last meeting in May 2019, the new board of directors was elected and, by statute, will remain in office for four years. The Italian Ambra Laurenzi is President The Vice-Presidents is Hanna Nowakowska of Poland, Jeanine Bochat of Germany is Secraitary General and her deputy Czech ≈†√°rka Kadlecov√°. Marie-France Cabeza-Mernet, from France, is the Treasurer with Fran√ßoise Marchelidon her deputy. Margarita Catal√† from Spain is auditor. The surviving members of the committee, Stella Nikiforwa, Yevgeniya Boyko, Barbara Piorowska, are assigned the position of honorary president.  History  After years of bilateral and multilateral cooperation, IRC was founded in East Berlin (GDR) in April 1965. Eleven countries were founding members. The first president served from 1965 to 1979 was the Frenchwoman Ren√©e Mirande-Laval, who had previously led coordinating preparatory work, in particular for the creation of the first museum in Ravensbr√ºck. From 1979 until her death in 1998, Rose Guerin served as President. Dr. Annette Chalut held the office from 1999 to 2015. From 2015 to June 2018, Dr. Eva B√§ckerov√° from Slovakia was President. In June 2018, the first representative of the generation of relatives, the Italian Ambra Laurenzi, became President. In later years, only a few direct survivors of the concentration camp were members, usually former child prisoners. Women of the generation born after the war whose relatives were imprisoned in the women's concentration camp, or women who are otherwise closely associated with the women of Ravensbr√ºck, support the IRC. Where no national associations exist, individual representatives of a country have taken on commemorative work. The national associations are independent. Membership in national associations is governed by the respective national statutes.  Mission  Ideological, religious and other attitudes and actions, as well as descent, are irrelevant for membership in the national associations and the IRC, as long as they correspond to the goals listed below. These are: * to secure the historical remnants and the memory of the former women's concentration camp Ravensbr√ºck and its branches, * to preserve the memories of the prisoners detained and who perished there, * to safeguard the moral and material rights of survivors and families of the dead, and to promote good relations between them, * to inform future generations and to help preserve peace. The International Ravensbr√ºck Committee holds annual meetings in various European countries where the memory of the deportation and the victims of the Nazi regime is preserved. The International Ravensbr√ºck Committee is one of the signatories of the legacy of the International Concentration Camp Communities, which was presented to Norbert Lammert, President of the Bundestag of the Federal Republic of Germany, in January 2009.

Regional Arts Commission is the largest funder of arts in the St. Louis region. RAC has awarded more than 7,000 grants totaling more than US$300 million. In 2018, the commission received $6.4 million in tax money. $3.8 million were awarded through a grants process to the arts community including 125 organizations, including the largest grantee at US$413,276 for the St. Louis Symphony, and the smallest grant of US$500 to an individual working the arts. Another portion of that money is used for a program called the Community Arts Training (CAT) Institute, a program with a 22 year track record which trains both artists of all disciplines and community members in how to use arts to effect change in their community. RAC also supports local conferences, events, workshops, and public art projects. The remainder of the funds support operations including salaries and building costs as well as a reserve fund. RAC has 15 full and part-time employees. The Commission's board is appointed by the Mayor of St. Louis and by the County Executive and is made up of 13 civic volunteers. The current director is Felicia Shaw who was hired by the Commission in 2015. She worked previously at San Diego's Commission for Arts and Culture as a program director and then for Young Audiences San Diego. She is originally from St. Louis and moved back to St. Louis in 2015 to lead RAC.  History  The Regional Arts Commission was founded in 1985 through a state charter and functions as a grantor and leader in the arts. RAC receives its primary funding from a portion of the hotel/motel tax collected from both St. Louis City and St. Louis County giving it an annual budget of about $6 Million. In 2015, Felicia Shaw took over as the director from Jill McGuire. McGuire was the first director of the agency and made a number of innovations in her 30 year tenure including adding grants to community-based organizations with arts programming; providing direct funding for artists; and increasing the national profile of the local agency through conferences and research studies.  Criticism  Shaw arrived on the job in 2015, and made it a priority to improve the transparency of the granting process and make a more fair system for dispersal of funds: :\\"That anyone had the impression that their tax money was locked up in a system of nepotism, whether that's true or not, was unsustainable,\\" Shaw stated.  Evoke, The Big Reveal and Creative Vision for St. Louis  In 2018, RAC led a series of sessions to get feedback from the local St. Louis community, called \\"Evoke\\", or the \\"Evoke Sessions\\". In 2018, RAC announced in press event titled, The Big Reveal, the first comprehensive creative vision for St. Louis, a 90-page report and website, created through a US$250,000 study paid for from RAC's marketing budget and corporate donations. In 2018, effects of the change in granting process effected some groups.  The Sound of St. Louis  In September 2018, with the last minute cancellation of the annual St. Louis music festival, LouFest, The Kranzberg Arts Foundation, Urban Chestnut Brewing Co., Gaslight Records, Venture Cafe, Regional Arts Commission, Fabricatorz Foundation, and Express Scripts sponsored a showcase called The Sound of St. Louis featuring over 15 local musical acts at The Grendel in Grand Center Arts District, St. Louis. The acts performing at the Sounds of St. Louis include Ben Reece's Unity Quartet, Bob DeBoo, The Burney Sisters, DJ AgileOne, Dracla, Grace Basement, Jesse Gannon, Kasimu-tet, Kevin Bowers' Nova, The Knuckles, Mo Egeston, Owen Ragland, Ptah Williams, The River Kittens, Scrub & Ace Ha, and Tonina.  St. Louis Art Place Project  In 2018, along with the Kranzberg Arts Foundation and the Incarnate Word Foundation, RAC created the St. Louis Art Place Project as a way to provide inexpensive housing and studio space to artist's in the St. Louis Gravois Park neighborhood.  Current  In 2018, Theatre Communications Group received a grant from RAC in support of the Third Round of Rising Leaders of Color program. In 2018, the RAC received a grant from the Gateway Foundation to help students who want to get into arts administration. In 2018, RAC received a US$1 million grant from Wells Fargo to develop new curriculum under the Lincoln Center plan.

It remained in the Hunt family until 1801, when it was sold to the politician John Maitland. It was built or rebuilt in 1775 by the architect Thomas Leverton.

Cramer and directed by Curtis Harrington from a teleplay by Robert Bloch and starring Meredith Baxter, David Hedison and Gale Sondergaard. The film serves as a tribute to the low-budget Val Lewton horror films of the 1940s and also features an appearance by Kent Smith, who starred in Lewton's original classic Cat People (1942) and its sequel The Curse of the Cat People (1944). It originally premiered as the ABC Movie of the Week on December 11, 1973. Robert Bloch tells in his autobiography how the film was originally planned as a starring vehicle for Diahann Carroll but that by the time the script was completed and approved, Miss Carroll had fulfilled her contractual obligations with the network and he had to rewrite her role. He also writes of other difficulties with the scripting. After being informed the script ran twelve minutes too long, and Bloch's laboriously editing the screenplay to make it run to time, on a viewing of the rushes it was found the film now ran twelve minutes too short. Most of the sets had already been torn down. Bloch had to work out how to put twelve minutes back into the film so it would go out over the network on the appointed date.Once Around the Bloch: An Unathorised Autobiography. NY: Tor Books, 1993, pp. 360-63 Plot Late one evening, Frank Lucas, a licensed appraiser, goes to the home of a client who has died to finish taking inventory on a collection of ancient artifacts that the man has left behind. He discovers a sarcophagus in the basement that holds a mummy wearing an amulet. The amulet is a solid gold cat's head with emerald eyes, once removed from the mummy unleashes a curse that was imposed thousands of years ago by a cat goddess. Frank suddenly hears the sound of a cat and is attacked and killed by a feline creature. Joe Sung, an Oriental thief, steals the amulet and tries to pawn it at The Sorcerer's Shop which specializes in the occult, but the proprietress Hester Black throws him out. Meanwhile, Lt. Marco is investigating the murder of Frank Lucas with the expert advice of Roger Edmonds, a professor who specializes in archeology. The theft of the amulet sets off a murderous chain of events involving Black, Lt. Marco, Edmonds, Sung, a salesgirl named Rena Carter and a black cat with glowing eyes.

The first new church to be built in the town, work began on building Holy Trinity in 1875 when the foundation stone was laid by Edward Harold Browne, Bishop of Winchester and was completed in 1878. The first President of the Committee charged with raising the funds to build the church was Sir James Hope Grant. Designed by Farnham-based architect Sidney Stapley, the church consists of a chancel of two bays and a good-sized nave of five bays with clerestory together with north and south aisles and north porch of simple style and the west porch with moulded arches. The church has a steep slate roof and is constructed of brick and coursed rubble with ashlar dressings, and is designed in an adaptation of 13th-century Early English style.Parishes in Aldershot ‚Äì British History Online database The building contract went to the local firm of Martin, Wells and Company, and cost ¬£6,000, plus an additional ¬£350 for the organ. The church could accommodate 800 people, but lack of funds meant that the tower and spire of Stapley‚Äôs original design were never built. Masonic designs Masonic designs are incorporated into various features of the church interior, including on the pulpit, various floor tiles and a window.

Although not a military church, Holy Trinity has strong connections with the Army. During World War II it served the men of the Canadian Army Overseas, whose chaplains conducted services for the troops who were quartered in Wellington Lines, Aldershot. It became traditional for drafts who were leaving Aldershot to join the forces overseas to hold a communion service in this church before being deployed. On the Albert Road stands the current Church hall, which replaced an earlier iron hall on the same site. The new building was named the Galpin Hall in memory of the Reverend Eric C Galpin MA, vicar of Holy Trinity from 1952 to 1966, who died a few months after taking early retirement due to ill health.

Bakatin's running mate was Ramazan Abdulatipov. Bakatin ultimately placed last in the election out of six candidates, receiving 2,719,757 votes (3.5% of the votes cast). Background Bakatin had previously been put forth as a candidate for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's nomination for the 1990 Soviet Union presidential election. However, he decided not to compete.–ü–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π –∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π: –∫–∞–∫ –ì–æ—Ä–±–∞—á–µ–≤ —Å—Ç–∞–ª –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–º –°–°–°–† BBC Russian, 11 March 2015 It had been rumored in late-April 1991 that Bakatin was going to be selected as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's nominee in the Russian presidential election. In early may, some figures in Russian politics believed that, if he ran, Murashev was poised to be Yeltsin's strongest opponent. In mid-May Bakatin, reportedly, had agreed to be Boris Yeltsin's running mate. However, he was ultimately persuaded by Mikhail Gorbachev to challenge Yeltsin for the presidency instead. Campaigning Launching his campaign in mid-May, Bakatin selected chairman of the Council of Nationalities of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet Ramazan Abdulatipov (one of presidential frontrunner Boris Yeltsin's primary political rivals) to be his running mate. He hoped that Abdulatipov would help him to appeal to voters in the Autonomous Republics of Russia, who cumulatively made-up 14% of the Russian electorate. Despite the fact that the Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic had officially had backed Nikolai Ryzhkov, upon Bakatin's entry into the race some members of the party commented that they believed that Bakatin would be a superior candidate to face Yeltsin in a second-round of the election. Since the party's primary goal was to beat Yeltsin, they provided support to both Bakatin and Ryzhkov's campaigns. In an effort to set himself apart, Bakatin derided Ryzhkov as a backwards-looking \\"man of yesterday\\". Bakatin campaigned vigorously. However, he was hampered by limited resources, which his campaign had dispersed too thinly for them to make enough of an impact. Nevertheless, in advance of the election, (along with Ryzhkov) he was seen as a likely individual to place second. Many polls predicted that he would place third. =Outcome= Bakatin's last-place finish was seen as a surprise. Particularly surprising was that he had been significantly outperformed by the campaign of nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky (who had a surprise third-place finish). Platform As a candidate, Bakatin sought to present himself as a liberal-leaning centrist. His policies were characterized as moderately progressive and incorporated many aspects of Gorbachev's politics. Bakatin was essentially regarded to be a moderate communist. His positions foremost appealed to reform-Communists. Bakatin dubbed himself to be the \\"only independent\\" candidate in the election. At the close of the campaign, he asserted that his positions were more closely similar to those of Yeltsin's than they were to those of Ryzhkov.

Ivy, from West's debut studio album The College Dropout (2004). It was released as the album's eight track, produced solely by West and samples \\"Maybe It's the Power of Love\\" by Blackjack. Within the song, one verse is included from West and so is one from Ivy, whose verse is a poem, whilst Jay has two verses. Music critics mostly had praise for it, but tended to view Jay's appearance in a negative light. In 2011, Billboard listed the song as the second greatest collaboration between Kanye and Jay. Although an accompanying music video wasn't ever produced for \\"Never Let Me Down\\", the audio of it was used in one of West's videos for \\"Jesus Walks\\". The song has managed to develop a significant legacy over time, despite never being released as a single. Background Ivy revealed that he originally knew West from Chicago, but was reintroduced to him in Jersey shortly before they collaborated on the track. He got a call from Coodie at 11pm on December 7, 2002 about being part of the song, in which Coodie said to him: \\"J, you need to get to L.A. Kanye got this song with him and Jay Z and he wants to put a poet on it. I told him he had to put J. Ivy on it.\\" and Ivy was initially like: \\"Stop bullshitting\\", before Coodie played it for him over the phone from Record Plant in Hollywood, California. At the time, Ivy had feelings of excitement about being on the record, not only because of: 'knowing that [West] was taking off to superstardom at the time', but also because he thought of Jay as: 'one of the greatest of all time'. After penning his verse, Ivy called Coodie and rapped to him over the phone, then he put Ivy on speaker phone to rap his verse again once Coodie went in the other room with people in it and the people in there reacted positively to Ivy's verse - this led to him rapping it over, over, over and over again to them. Release On the original track list of The College Dropout, \\"Never Let Me Down\\" was number fourteen, instead of number eight as it stands on the official release. When the album was released, West referenced featuring artist Jay-Z in the booklet's list of 'Thanx' by crediting: 'Jay 4 blowin me up'. Despite a music video never being released, part of the song is played during the ending of the second version of three videos for West's 2004 single \\"Jesus Walks\\", which comes one position before it on the album's track list. Ivy performed a poetry style rendition of his verse for the Season 5 opener of Russell Simmons presents HBO Def Poetry in 2006, which was only performed live and never part of any release by the rapper. The verse being performed by Ivy for this opener was appropriate, since he considers it to be a poem. Sample Within the track, American band Blackjack's 1980 song \\"Maybe It's the Power of Love\\" is sampled. In February 2015, band member Michael Bolton recalled clearing the sample at the time, revealing that he required the artists to send him the lyrics first to see if the content was worthy of his approval - in the end, Bolton believed that: 'the song turned out beautifully' and he's 'totally happy with it'. Bolton actually took to the online site Genius and annotated the song. However, it was also revealed by Bolton that he didn't know who Kanye and Jay were when he first found out that they were trying to license \\"Maybe It's the Power of Love\\", until his daughters told him: \\"They're like the biggest rappers in the business, dad.\\" - Bolton himself even admitted to being out of touch during this time. Lyrics Jay-Z has two verses on \\"Never Let Me Down\\" The first of the two verses by Jay is recycled from his 2002 song \\"Hovi Baby\\" (Remix), whilst the last is an entirely new verse. Ivy's verse is a poem that he wrote in a notebook, which Ivy claimed was something that he turned to God and prayed for. The lines rapped in West's verse: \\"Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away/So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter\\" mark a promise that he didn't keep, since the rapper went on to marry Kim Kardashian in 2014 rather than Sumeke Rainey. Within the verse, West raps the line: \\"Racism‚Äôs still alive, they just be concealin' it\\", which went on to be one of his most quoted lyrics. The 2002 car accident involving West is referenced by him with the line: \\"I know I got angels watching me from the other side\\", which is a subject he mostly touches on in debut single \\"Through the Wire\\". Recording On February 13, 2014, a video surfaced online from 2003 of West rapping his verse to Pharrell in the studio, as well as singing along with the sample and Pharrell clearly showed excitement after hearing the rap from him. The verse was actually recorded by West on the night of the Madison Square Garden show by Jay that he wasn't invited to. Ivy rapped his verse on speaker phone to West and others on December 7, 2002, then flew over to Hollywood to join them in recording via West's request. It was revealed by Tarry Torae that West set up a little studio section in his living room during the recording of \\"Never Let Me Down\\" and Torae ended up recording two or three songs in the night of this session, one of which was \\"My Way\\" which ended up on West's mixtape Freshmen Adjustment (2004). When it comes to Jay's appearance on the track, John Monopoly revealed that he recorded for it literally two days before mastering of the featuring album - however, Jay had confirmed to give West a feature before it was even known which track he'd be part of. Reception =Critical response= \\"Never Let Me Down\\" received positive reviews from the majority of music critics, though most tended to have praise for West's work and express negativity towards Jay's contributions. Paul Cantor of Billboard had mixed views towards the song, describing Jay's presence as being where he \\"phones in a verse about making number one albums\\", but praising the rest of it for being \\"about overcoming racism and undefeatable odds\\". Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork felt negatively about Jay's contributions too, labelling his appearance as him \\"already sounding groggy from retirement\\". Jay's content was viewed as paling in comparison to that of West by Dave Heaton of PopMatters, since he described the song as \\"where Jay-Z rhymes about attaining status and power, Kanye one- ups him with a show-stopping attack on racism and meditation on death\\". The staff of HipHopDX actually put Jay forward as being better than West on the song but didn't lack praise for either rapper, writing that \\"Jay-Z drops 2 incredible verses on [Never Let Me Down] with Kanye not far behind delivering the verse of his career.\\" It was viewed by Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine as being one of the album tracks where West \\"proves he can flow with the best of them\\". =Accolades= HotNewHipHop placed it at number 48 on their list of West's 50 best songs. On Complex's list of his 100 best songs, the track was ranked at number 82. \\"Never Let Me Down\\" was listed by Billboard as being the second greatest Jay and Kanye collaboration in August 2011, post-release of their collaborative album Watch the Throne. Time named it the second best song of 2004. Legacy The video of West rapping \\"Never Let Me Down\\" to Pharrell from 2003 actually surfaced online within the same week as the tenth anniversary of The College Dropout and it was regarded as a classic track by this point. Ivy's appearance on it has been regarded as one of the most significant moments of his career. West's lyrics: \\"I get down for my grandfather/Who took my mama/Made her sit in that seat where white folks didn't want us to eat/At the tender age of six, she was arrested for the sit- ins/And with that in my blood, I was born to be different\\" were viewed by Spin in 2014 as showing \\"heavenly inspiration and scrappy determination\\", which was claimed for West to still be showing nine years later in his 2013 track \\"I Am a God\\". When Ben Westhoff of The Guardian published an article in April 2015 that ranked the album at number one in West's discography, the song was the end of what he called \\"as powerful a sequence as I've ever heard on record\\". Ivy blogged in celebration of The College Dropout's 13th anniversary on February 10, 2017 and shared the original page with his lyrics scribbled down, alongside various notes.

Cooper was the last known speaker of ti≈Çhini (formerly known as Obispe√±o), though she had rarely spoken or heard it since her early childhood. During the last years of her life, Rosario worked with the linguist J.P. Harrington to recover what she could recall of her native language, and the pair were able to document some grammatical structure, place names, songs, and cultural knowledge before she died in 1917. Cooper is considered to be the last known speaker of ti≈Çhini, though there has been some recent revitalization.  Early life and family  Cooper was born on October 5, 1845 and died on June 15, 1917. After her mother, Ana Maria Masta, died in 1851, Cooper was raised by her older sister Augustina. At the time of her work with Harrington, Cooper was married to her third husband, Mauro Soto, and they lived together in the Lopez Canyon area in Arroyo Grande. Cooper had at least three children, only one of whom survived infancy. Cooper's son, Francisco Olivas, was a father to several children and grandchildren, many of who still reside in California and carry on Cooper's legacy. Cooper was baptized by a Franciscan priest in San Luis Obispo, and she practiced both Roman Catholic and Native beliefs. In addition, Cooper's work with Harrington revealed that she was interested in midwifery and had knowledge of native flora that could be used for healing purposes. Shortly before her death, Cooper helped to deliver one of her great-granddaughters.  Work with anthropologist J.P. Harrington  From 1914 to 1916 for a total of around six or seven weeks, Cooper worked with the linguist J.P. Harrington to document what she could remember of her native language, ti≈Çhini. Despite challenges facing Cooper and Harrington, such as Cooper's declining health and age and the fact that Cooper had probably not spoken or heard her native language since her childhood, the pair persisted in documenting linguistic and cultural knowledge about the indigenous people who lived in what is now the area of San Luis Obispo county. Harrington's primary focus as a linguist was the documentation of the ti≈Çhini language and grammatical structure, but through their interviews they were also able to document cultural knowledge pertaining to indigenous material culture, diet and use of native flora and fauna, indigenous beliefs and practices, place names, and songs and dances. Cooper also related stories and experiences from her youth that reflected relationships and people in her life that had been important to her. = Material culture = From her childhood, Rosario recalled watching her mother and how she started fires using rotating sticks, and made hairbrushes embedded with glass beads to sell. She also described a game played with walnuts filled with brea by Yokuts natives. = Diet and use of native flora and fauna = Cooper also talked about traditional plant foods gathered and prepared by the native women in her life, such as islay and acorns. Given the proximity to the California coast, Rosario also reported indigenous uses of marine foods, such as collecting clams at Avila Beach and using sea urchins for food and medicinal purposes. = Indigenous spirituality and practices = During the interviews, Cooper told Harrington about indigenous uses and fears of spiritual practices, which she reported had resulted in the death of several of her half-siblings. Cooper also told Harrington a story about the time her own mother had been bewitched, and had then sought out the help of a medicine-man, who used techniques such as fasting, singing, and blood-letting to cure her. Though Spanish introduction of Catholicism across California interrupted some native beliefs, Cooper said that the Chumash believed in the sun, moon, stars, bear, and coyote. Cooper also had recollections of older Chumash women offering sacrifices off the coast to marine animals like dolphins and swordfish. = Place names = Cooper also related to Harrington the place name of tst ∏…®w…®, which was later used to identify the archaeological site at Pecho Creek. In 2015, an archaeological investigation was conducted by California Polytechnic State University, observed by Cooper's great, great granddaughter, which revealed archaeological findings that gave important insight into how the indigenous lifestyles changed from pre-contact to post-contact times. = Songs and dances = During their time together, Harrington recorded Cooper talking and singing in ti≈Çhini on wax cylinders. From her recollections, Rosario described singers and dancers she had known in her youth, and what they had passed on to her. Rosario sang 21 songs for Harrington, including the coyote and skunk songs. The swordfish dance she described included a costumed dancer who had a stick in each hand to hit together. The wax cylinder recordings were transferred to tape during the Library of Congress' Federal Cylinder Project and can be accessed in the Smithsonian Institution archives.  Legacy  Without the knowledge of Rosario Cooper and the collaboration of J.P. Harrington, the ti≈Çhini language would have gone undocumented. Because of Cooper's collaboration and Harrington extensive field notes, a written record survives that modern students of the language can use as a resource. Cooper's legacy has also provided guidance and knowledge for her family and the yak tit ∏u tit ∏u yak ti≈Çhini peoples, who have been able to revitalize the dances and songs described and sung by Cooper. The Northern Chumash Tribe partnered with California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo to work together and honor the tribe by using yak tit ∏u tit ∏u yak ti≈Çhini village names for the university's new residential community called yak îit ∏ut ∏u, which opened in fall of 2018.

It is a Grade II* listed building. It was built between 1749 and 1751 for Admiral Lord Rodney on a gently sloping south facing site between the village churchyard and Alresford Pond, paid for by the riches accrued in a successful naval career fighting the French in the Caribbean. The house is constructed of brick with Bath stone dressings and slated roofs in 3 storeys and a basement. It has a 7-bay frontage with the central 3 bays slightly projecting. There are single bay flanking wings at each end with single storey service wings on both sides at the front forming a courtyard. Rodney purchased Alresford Pond in 1755 before commissioning Richard Woods to create the park in 1764, which is itself now Grade II listed. History Old Alresford (pronounced Allsford) had belonged to the Bishop of Winchester for over a thousand years. During the mid-12th century, Bishop Godfrey de Lucy, built the long Great Weir to create a balancing lake, known as Alresford Pond, for the Itchen Navigation. Admiral Rodney's house was built on the site of an old manor house owned by the Norton family. Unfortunately Rodney got into unrelated financial difficulties and was forced to move to France to escape his creditors. His son George took over the estate, but the debts were repaid and the Admiral was able to return home. Old Alresford House passed down in the Rodney family for three generations until it was sold in 1870 to William Whitear Bulpitt, a banker. His family kept possession of the property until 1926, when it was sold to C. F. G. R. Schwerdt, an art collector. He died in 1931 and his mausoleum stands in the churchyard. The house then passed to Wing Commander Gerald and Mrs. Constable Maxwell. Maxwell was a highly decorated World War I fighter pilot who is also buried in the neighbouring churchyard. After his death in 1959 his family stayed on at the house. In 1990 the property was acquired by Peter and Gayle MacDermott.

Life Emily de Burgh Daly was born Emily Lucy French on 7 August 1859 at the family home at Clooneyquin, County Roscommon. She was the fourth daughter of the nine children of Christopher French and Susan Emma French (n√©e Percy). One of her older brothers was the humorist and songwriter Percy French. She was educated privately at home, with the children producing their own theatricals and family magazines. Daly left home in 1888, training as a nurse at the Mildmay Hospital, Bethnal Green, London. After this she travelled to Ningbo, China, nursing and going on to take charge of a hospital for women. During her 25 years in China, she attempted to learn the language but never mastered it. When she married Charles de Burgh Daly in October 1890, she gave up nursing. Charles was the port doctor for Ningbo and director of the Church Missionary Society Hospital. The couple had at least two sons, Ulick and Arthur Charles, and one daughter, Lucy. Arthur and Ulick both served with the Royal Dublin Fusiliers and Lucy with the Voluntary Aid Detachment in Dublin during World War I. The family moved to Newchwang, southern Manchuria in 1893, where they took in refugees from the Sino-Japanese war in 1894. During this time, Daly travelled around China extensively, witnessing the run up to the Boxer Rebellion and the Russo-Japanese War, escaping the country with her children during both of those conflicts. Her husband was recalled to Ireland in 1910 to aid in the treatment of those suffering from the pneumonic plague. In 1912 she published her memoirs, An Irishwoman in China, in which she described the customs and people of China, and the lifestyle of Europeans living there. She edited two collections of her brother's work: Chronicles and poems of Percy French (1922) and Prose, poems and parodies of Percy French (1925).

Built at Devonport Dockyard, Sharpshooter was completed in 1937. She served through the Second World War, acting both in her designed role as minesweeper and as a convoy escort, escorting several Arctic convoys. She took part in the evacuation from Dunkirk in 1940, and sank the in 1942. Post war, she was converted to a survey ship, and was renamed HMS Shackleton in 1953. She was laid up into reserve in 1961 and sold for scrap in 1965. Design The Halcyon class were a class of dedicated minesweepers, designed to be smaller and cheaper than the dual- purpose (minesweeping and colonial patrol vessel) minesweeping sloops that had been built since the late 1920s (i.e. the , and ), which as their design evolved, were becoming increasingly focused on escort duties and becoming too large for use as minesweepers. Sharpshooter was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of at deep load. Displacement was standard and deep load. Two Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers supplied steam to geared steam turbines driving two shafts. The machinery was rated at giving a speed of . Armament consisted of two QF 4 inch (102 mm) Mk V guns on High- Angle mounts and so capable of being used for anti-aircraft duties, with a close-in armament of one quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mount. One of the 4-inch guns was removed during the Second World War, while the multiple machine guns were replaced by 4‚Äì8 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Up to 40 depth charges could be carried when used in the escort role. The ship had a crew of 80 officers and other ranks. Construction Sharpshooter was ordered on 2 March 1936 under the 1935 shipbuilding programme and was laid down at Devonport Naval Dockyard on 8 June 1936. She was launched on 10 December 1936 and completed on 17 December 1937. Service Following commissioning (where she received the pennant number N68  this was changed to J68 in 1940) Sharpshooter joined the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla based at Portland. Along with the rest of her Flotilla, Sharpshooter moved to Scapa Flow, the Flotilla's war station, from August to September 1938 during the Munich crisis. With other ships of the flotilla she took part in the search in June 1939 for the submarine Thetis which had sunk in Liverpool Bay. She then operated with the flotilla in the Channel, and took part in the Royal Inspection (Reserve Fleet Review) at Portland on 9 August 1939. =Second World War= Sharpshooter was still a member of the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla in September 1939, at the outbreak of the Second World War. The outbreak of war saw Sharpshooter clearing channels through minefields around Scapa Flow and off Loch Ewe and the Clyde estuary. At the end of May 1940, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was trapped by German forces at Dunkirk, France and it was decided to launch Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the BEF from Dunkirk. Sharpshooter was one of the ships assigned to the evacuation. She made her first evacuation run on the morning of 29 May, landing 69 troops picked up from the Dunkirk beaches at Dover, with a second run made on the morning of the 30 May, picking up 273 troops. Sharpshooter was outbound on another run when at 22:10 hr, she collided with the Dover-bound steamer . Sharpshooters bow was badly damaged, and she was towed back to Dover by the tugboat Foremost 22, the journey taking 11 hours. She was under repair at Sheerness dockyard and Leith until September 1940, the opportunity being taken to fit Sharpshooter with equipment for sweeping magnetic mines. On 20 February 1941 Sharpshooter was approaching Harwich with sister ships , , and when they came under attack by two German aircraft. Bramble was hit by a German bomb that failed to explode, but damage was minimal. From April, Sharpshooter began to be used to escort convoys in the Western Approaches. Arctic convoys On 27 November 1941 she set out from Hvalfjord in Iceland as part of the escort of the Arctic convoy PQ 5 to Archangel in the Soviet Union. Sharpshooter remained in Russia, minesweeping and providing local escort for Arctic convoys as they arrived and left Russian ports. Convoys escorted included PQ 8, PQ 9/10, QP 7 and QP 9. On the night of 17/18 January 1942, Sharpshooter had just joined the escort of PQ 8 when the German submarine torpedoed and sank the destroyer . Sharpshooter helped to rescue survivors from Matebele then launched a counter attack against the submarine. At about 8.25 pm on the evening of 24 March 1942 while escorting QP 9 the leading gunner on the forward four-inch gun of Sharpshooter spotted German submarine U-655 on the surface beam on, about two to three cables (370 to 556 meters) away and about 10 degrees off the minesweeper's starboard bow, with no crew apparently manning the conning tower or deck. Upon being called by the officer of the watch the captain Lieutenant-Commander David Lampen immediately called for emergency full ahead and called 'Stand by to ram'. ‚Äò‚ÄôSharpsweeper‚Äô‚Äô had just begun to gather speed when she struck the submarine just behind the conning tower.Paterson. pp. 89-90 The submarine turned rolled over due to the impact and bumped along the minesweeper's port side sinking as it disappeared astern and sank stern first south-east of Bear Island, in approximate position 73.00N, 21.00E. No trace of the submarine or her crew of 45 was found except for two lifebuoys and what may have been a canvas dinghy. The bow of Sharpshooter was badly damaged by the collusion. After shoring up the forward mess deck, she continued at slow speed to Iceland independent of the convoy, and from there to Leith for repair. She was under repair until June 1942. In September 1942, Sharpshooter formed part of the close escort for the Arctic convoy PQ 18, with Sharpshooter being used as a rescue ship to pick survivors from sunken ships as well as for more conventional escort duties. The convoy came under heavy air and submarine attack, with 13 ships in total being sunk. Sharpshooter rescued 101 survivors during the operation. In November 1942, Sharpshooter escorted the return convoy QP 15 to Iceland, but on 27 November, shortly after leaving the convoy, collided with the cargo ship Empire Snow, badly damaging the minesweeper. Mediterranean In April 1943 Sharpshooter was ordered to join the 12th Minesweeping Squadron in the Mediterranean, and in July the year took part in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. After Husky, Sharpshooter continued to carry out minesweeping and convoy escort operations in the Mediterranean until October 1944 when she returned to home waters. =Survey ship= In May 1945, Sharpshooter began conversion to a survey ship at Chatham Dockyard. Her armament was removed during this conversion, which continued until March 1946. On 3 April 1946, Sharpshooter was damaged in a collision with the merchant ship MV Fealtie. After repair and working up, she was deployed to Singapore, carrying out survey operations off Malaya and Borneo. During surveys of Penang, she discovered five submerged wrecks. On 13 October 1947 she collided with the merchant ship MV Celebes and after repair continued survey duties before returning to Britain at the start of 1948. After refit she recommissioned, receiving the new pennant number A310, and operating out of Lowestoft. On 15 June 1953 she took part in the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead, and on 1 July that year was renamed Shackleton. She ran aground in the Bristol Channel on 28 October 1958, damaging her sonar dome. On 20 August 1959, the prototype Handley Page Victor B2 bomber crashed into the Irish Sea. A large scale salvage effort was launched by the Royal Navy to locate and recover the wreckage, so the cause of the accident could be determined. Shackleton was diverted from her normal survey duties to take part in this search and salvage operation, and on 20 April, while searching for debris of the bomber, was diverted to the aid of a trawler, the Starbank, that had an uncontrolled leak. Shackleton transferred pumps over to the trawler, which allowed the leak to be controlled, and escorted Starbank to Milford Haven. =Disposal= Sharpshooter was refitted at Devonport in 1961, but was then immediately paid off into reserve. She was placed on the disposal list in 1965 and was sold to the British Iron & Steel Corporation (BISCO) for scrapping. The ship was allocated to the West of Scotland Shipbreaking Company, and arrived at their Troon yard for breaking up on 3 November 1965.

Sarah Atkins married Daniel Frederick Wilson (1805‚Äì86), the Rector of Worton, Oxfordshire, on 14 December 1829. His father, Daniel Wilson, the prominent Vicar of Islington and the future Bishop of Calcutta, presided at the ceremony.Oxfordshire Family History Society; Oxford, Oxfordshire, England; Anglican Parish Registers; Reference Number: PAR301/1/R3/2 Their son, also called Daniel Frederick Wilson (1830-1918), was born on 10 November 1830 and baptized on 12 December 1830 at Worton.Oxfordshire Family History Society; Oxford, Oxfordshire, England; Anglican Parish Registers; Reference Number: PAR301/1/R2/1 Atkins changed her first name to Lucy upon being baptized for her marriage to a clergyman. Her books, therefore, are attributed to various combinations of her names, including Sarah Atkins, Lucy Wilson, and Sarah Atkins Wilson. Additionally, as was common at the time, many of her books were published under pseudonyms, such as 'A Lady,' or as the author of a previous one of her works, such as 'The Author of Botanical Rambles.' Wilson mothered another eight children following their marriage, and wrote an anonymous publication detailing the efforts made as the wife of a clergyman, Hints to a Clergyman's Wife (1832). She lived in Islington, Greater London, until her death on 25 January 1863, at the age of 61. Her brief obituary in The Newcastle Courant remembers her contributions to literature, concluding that: \\"Her life was much devoted to works of piety and benevolence, and her loss will be deeply felt\\".  Literary influence  Wilson was part of a small, British literary movement, led by women, to create instructional and amusing books regarding science, geography, and history, for children. Large type font and simple language gear the works towards younger readers, while her titles often explicitly address her audience. Wilson commonly uses a dialog format, with a mother, as an omniscient being, speaking to and answering the questions of her children. This places the maternal figure as an individual with informational authority, and aims to inspire curiosity within child readers. Title Page of Fruits of Enterprise Wilson frequently drew inspiration from other female authors of the time, most notably, Priscilla Wakefield; Botanical Rambles (1822) draws heavily upon Wakefield's work, and even references Wakefield's Introduction to Botany as an authority on the subject. Like many other 19th century female writers, including Wakefield, Wilson was both driven and empowered by religion. Her Quaker upbringing and her eventual baptism into the Catholic Church, both brought her greater access to publishing and distributing. Quaker women had greater opportunity to exercise their voice, and Wilson capitalized on this, publishing at least ten works before converting to Catholicism. At this point, her reputation was established, and her work grew more religious in content, to include titles such as Mamma's Bible Stories for Her Little Boys and Girls (1834), which told religious stories in simplified language. Throughout her literary career, Wilson focused chiefly on using a union of information and amusement to intrigue young minds on scientific topics. Many of her works were categorized as 'children's primers' such as The Juvenile Rambler and included puzzles or 'dissected maps' in later editions: these games were viewed as educational supplements and aimed to connect learning and amusement. This theme was common to the educational approach of the time period in Britain, and is confirmed by the relative popularity of Wilson's works: nearly all of Wilson's works published multiple editions and remained in print well into the Victorian period. Some were even translated into other languages; Fruits of Enterprise (1821) was translated into French two years after being published in English.

The path crosses the Highland Boundary Fault, which divides the Scottish Highlands from the Lowlands, and is named for the three major lochs linked by the route: Loch Lomond, the Gare Loch and Loch Long. About 1,500 people use the path every year, of whom about 300 complete the entire route. The route was first conceived of in 1991 by Alan Day, secretary of the Helensburgh & District Access Trust. The trust began promoting the route in 2010, and have since undertaken work across the route to improve the signage and path conditions, leading to the route now being designated as one of Scotland's Great Trails by NatureScot. The Three Lochs Way links directly to the Cowal Way (also designated as one of the Great Trails), which shares the section along Glen Loin between Arrochar and Inveruglas. The Way crosses the route of a second Great Trail, the John Muir Way, either side of Helensburgh. The West Highland Way, Scotland's first officially designated long distance trail can also be linked to the Three Lochs Way via a ferry over Loch Lomond from the start/finish point of Inveruglas, joining the West Highland Way at Inversnaid. By combining sections of the three paths and the ferry, a circular walk around southern Loch Lomond is possible. In April 2018 an ultramarathon was due to be held along the route of the Three Lochs Way, but was cancelled with less than 24 hours' notice due to the company organising the event going into administration. Around 60 of the 700 people entered in the event chose to complete the course despite the lack of any organised support.

Life  Born in Athens, Markeas studied at the National Conservatory of Greece. After a year of law studies in Athens he entered the Conservatoire de Paris (CNSMD) in the class of Gabriel Tacchino and then in that of Alain Plan√®s. In 1990 he was unanimously awarded a First Prize for piano and a year later a First Prize in chamber music, also unanimously awarded by the jury.Biography (Musicatreize) At the same time, he got interested in music writing and musical composition. He completed his training at the CNSMD with first prizes in counterpoint (1992), fugue (1994) and finally composition (1996), a discipline for which he was admitted to the advanced training cycle. In addition, he was selected to follow the composition and computer music curriculum of the Ircam.Alexandros Markeas (ressources Ircam) In 1998, he participated in the first European Academy of Music of the Aix-en-Provence Festival where he wrote the music for a ballet. In 2000-2001 he was a resident of the Villa M√©dicis. Markeas is part of the heritage of the Parisian spectral school, that of a \\"processual\\" music, a music more attached to sound than to the note, gradually moving from one state of the material to another; a music involving a dialectic between harmonic and inharmonic, between periodicity and aperiodicity. To this compositional approach, Alexandros Markeas adds a theatrical dimension, allowing him to escape from \\"pure music\\". His compositions are marked by the use of multimedia techniques. At some time he was a professor of generative improvisation at the Conservatoire de Paris (CNSMD).

Description Pseudorhabdosynochus bouaini, squamodiscs and haptoral parts Pseudorhabdosynochus bouaini is a small monogenean. The species has the general characteristics of other species of Pseudorhabdosynochus, with a flat body and a posterior haptor, which is the organ by which the monogenean attaches itself to the gill of is host. The haptor bears two squamodiscs, one ventral and one dorsal. The sclerotized male copulatory organ, or \\"quadriloculate organ\\", has the shape of a bean with four internal chambers, as in other species of Pseudorhabdosynochus.

Allen is a prosecutor and former District Attorney of Anchorage, Alaska. Alaska Attorney General Jahna Lindemuth appointed him to the position in October 2017, replacing replaced Clint Campion, who resigned on October 6, 2017, citing personal reasons. Allen attended high school in Johannesburg from 1991 to 1992. He graduated with a degree in political science from the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1996 and received his JD from University of Idaho College of Law in 2000. He was in private practice from September 2000 to December 2003. Allen began his career in Alaska in 2004 as an assistant district attorney in the Palmer District Attorney office. In 2011, Allen became director of the Office of Public Advocacy (OPA) within the Alaska Department of Administration. Allen resigned as Anchorage District Attorney in December 2018 at the request of Attorney General Kevin G. Clarkson, who replaced Lindemuth the same month, and returned to the Palmer District Attorney's office. He was succeeded by John Novak, a former assistant district attorney in Anchorage. Sentencing controversy In September 2018, Allen's office entered into a plea bargain with lawyers for Justin Scott Schneider, a former FAA air traffic controller who allegedly kidnapped a native Alaskan woman in the middle of the day from a gas station, choked her until she passed out and then masturbated over her. A grand jury indicted Schneider on four felony counts of kidnapping and assault in August 2017. According to charging documents, the 25 year-old victim was ‚Äúwas very traumatized, and was very emotionally upset recalling the event... to the point where she couldn‚Äôt hardly speak.‚Äù She told Detective Brett Sarber that Schneider \\"violently grabbed her neck in a front choke hold with both hands and told her if she screamed, he‚Äôd kill her.\\" In exchange for Schneider's guilty plea, Allen's office dropped the four felony charges brought by the grand jury to one count of second-degree assault. Allen's office recommended a two-year sentence with one year suspended. On September 19, 2018, Judge Michael Corey accepted the plea bargain, giving Schneider credit for his year of house arrest and suspending the second year in the sentence. Thus Schneider will serve no jail time. Schneider \\"offered no apology or recognition of the potential long-term impacts the assault might have had on his victim.\\" Instead he expressed gratitude for the process in comments focused on himself. Also at the sentencing hearing, Allen's Assistant District Attorney Andrew Grannik stated that \\"I would like the gentleman to be on notice that is his one pass ‚Äî it‚Äôs not really a pass ‚Äî but given the conduct, one might consider it is.‚Äù In addition, Grannik referred to Schneider's having lost his air traffic controller job as \\"life sentence.\\" In response to citizen outrage at the reduced sentence and Grannik's comment about Schneider getting \\"a pass,\\" the Alaska Department of Law issued a statement after the September 19, 2018 sentencing hearing. In a news release, the director of the Alaska Department of Law Criminal Division, John Skidmore, said that \\"Alaska law allows an offender to receive credit for any time spent on an ankle monitor or under house arrest against any jail sentence imposed.\\" In addition, he said that \\"contact with bodily fluid such as semen is not categorized as a sex crime under Alaska law.\\" Thus Schneider will not have to register with the state as a sex offender. However, one of the conditions of his three-year probation is sex-offender treatment and monitoring. Should he violate those terms, he will serve time in jail. Skidmore also said that Grannick's comments were \\"unfortunate and misunderstood.\\" Schneider's sentence \\"doesn't come anywhere close to being a life sentence,\\" Skidmore told the Alaska Daily News. Governor Bill Walker \\"issued a statement saying the sentence was insufficient and saying he wants to toughen the law.\\" He stated that he would propose legislation that makes \\"unwanted contact with semen a sex crime.\\" References Category:Alaska lawyers Category:American prosecutors Category:Living people Category:University of Idaho College of Law alumni Category:University of Texas at San Antonio alumni Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Richard K.

It premiered at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) 18 November 2017 where it screened at Tuschinski Amsterdam in the Dutch Documentary Competition and First Appearance Competition. On 14 December 2017 the film was theatrically released in the Netherlands and Belgium. Slamdance Film Festival hosted the American festival premiere on 21 January 2018 in Park City, Utah. April 2019 the film was theatrical released in the US and Canada, starting with select screenings in New York and Los Angeles. Film content Instant Dreams tells the story of those who eagerly await the rebirth of the classic and recognizable Polaroid photo, and of scientists who are trying to unravel the secrets of the chemical formula. The film features Stefanie Schneider ‚Äì a free-spirited German artist who lives in a Polaroid picture- world out in the Californian desert, Christopher Bonanos - an editor at New York Magazine and author of the book Instant: The Story of Polaroid, Stephen Herchen - a chemist who worked alongside Polaroid's inventor and in his lab tries to unravel the formula which he describes as ‚Äúthe chemically most complex manmade thing ever made.‚Äù Meanwhile in Tokyo, a young girl is just starting to discover it all while taking snap-shots on her iPhone. Their lives are strangely connected, each in their own way compelled not to let the medium die. A central theme in the film is the term Wabi-sabi about the beauty of imperfection. Besides the main characters there is archival footage of Edwin H. Land, German Cult actor Udo Kier from Stefanie Schneider's Polaroid film \\"The girl behind the white picket fence\\" and there is a voice-cameo by documentary director Werner Herzog. Style Instant Dreams is not a conventional documentary but rather a visual essay film and borrows some of its style from 1970s science-fiction films. International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) described the film as a \\"Rollercoaster of color and light\\". Slamdance compared the cinematography to a mixture between Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey. During a Dutch television appearance Baptist confirmed these films influenced him and that he took cues from Close Encounters of the Third Kind for constructing the story. Background In 2016, Impossible Magazine reported that Baptist was shooting a documentary, titled Instant Dreams, in Berlin and California. In an interview with Dutch newspaper Trouw, Baptist said his lively dreams were a source of inspiration in making the documentary. The documentary was shot in multiple locations: Twentynine Palms, New York City, Berlin, Tokyo, D√ºsseldorf and at the factory of Polaroid Originals in Enschede on different Arri Alexa camera's at 2K and 4K resolution. The aspect-ratio is 2.39:1 cinemascope. Christopher Bonanos wrote about his experiences in participating in the film in an article on Vulture.com titled \\"How My Son and I Ended Up in a Film About Film.\\" In the article he describes the demanding shooting schedule. In 2018 Variety reported that Synergetic Distribution, ahead of Instant Dream's New York festival premiere at Doc NYC, acquired the U.S. rights and were planning a 2019 theatrical release. In April 2019 the film was theatrical released in the US and Canada, starting with select screenings in New York and Los Angeles. For the American release the tag line was changed from \\"An Extraordinary Polaroid Trip\\" to \\"The Lost Chemistry of Dr. Land\\". The Saugatuck Center for the Arts, presented the Midwest premiere on Friday, October 19, 2018, and featured an on-site Polaroid portrait studio in the lobby. A soundtrack album was digitally released in 2017 to coincide with the release of the film. Written by composer Marc Lizier, the soundtrack features a blend of retro electronic and orchestral musical pieces. In the Netherlands NTR broadcast the film via the Dutch public broadcasting system. In the UK it was broadcast via Sky Arts. Critical reception In its origin country the Netherlands the film was generally met with critical praise. Newspapers Volkskrant, Trouw and Parool each rated it 4 out of 5 stars. Volkskrant wrote: \\"Baptist made a film like a hallucinatory trip; a fantastic tribute to an enchanting medium.\\" Dutch based Film Score Magazine called it \\"One of the most astonishing documentary films to have been made in Holland.\\" Upon its US theatrical release, the film initially divided some critics. The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter and the Los Angeles Times wished the filmmakers had pursued a more journalistic approach. Other media outlets such as Geek.com, Ozus' World Movie Reviews, Film Inquiry and Eye on Film were far more accepting of the film, praising the storytelling, cinematography and artistry of filmmaking. Film Threat rated it 9 out of 10 stars. Eye on Film rated it 4.5 out of 5 stars and called \\"a dazzling piece of work\\". Instant Dreams holds a positive overall score on Rotten Tomatoes, rating it ‚Äòfresh‚Äô based on multiple critic reviews.

The forests of Canada are located across much of the country. Approximately half of Canada is covered by forest, totaling around . Over 90% of Canada's forests are owned by the public (Crown land land and Provincial forest). About half of the forests are allocated for logging. Named forests are found within eight distinct regions. These forests may also be part of ecosystems, a number of which extend south into the United States. For example, the Northern hardwood forest is an ecosystem located in large areas of southeastern and south central Canada as well as in Ontario and Quebec. This system extends south to west and even into the United States.

The academy conducts language training for servicemen and employees of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, advanced training of military personnel and scientific and pedagogical workers, and the preparation of students in the training of reserve officers. Origins =Creation= The academy was founded as the Odessa Infantry School in 1865, by order of the Minister of War. It was then intended to be a preparatory school that trains infantrymen to serve as a military officer rank. The building of the school was designed by the Russian architect Vasily F. Maas. The military academy was succeeded by the Cadet Corps, which was created on April 16, 1899, by direct the order of Nicholas II, according to the order of creating the school. The idea for creating the cadet corps came from the commander of the Odessa Military District, Count Alexander Ivanovich Musin-Pushkin, who in the mid-1890s recognized the need for the establishment of a special military educational institution in the city of Odessa. =Soviet era= In July 1919, the courses were reorganized into the Military School of the Eastern Front. During the Russian Civil War, courses and schools were repeatedly relocated as the Red Army advanced to Ukraine. In July 1941, the school was redeployed to the Saratov Oblast. In December 1943, the school was given the honorific of Mikhail Frunze. In 1947, it was named the Kiev United College of Self- propelled Artillery. In July 1954, the school was redesignated the Kiev Tank SchoolMichael Holm, Kiev Higher Combined Arms Command twice Red Banner School imeni M.V. Frunze, accessed July 2020. and was then called the Kiev Command and Technical School, before being renamed to the Kiev Higher Combined Arms Command School. In 1943 and 1968, the school was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. In 1968, it became the senior educational institution of the Soviet Armed Forces for the training of officers of military intelligence units. =Reorganization= By the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on August 19, 1992, the school was closed. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the school remained largely inactive until the military academy was reestablished on June 30, 2011 on the basis of the Military Institute of the Odessa National Polytechnic University in accordance with the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine signed on March 23, 2011. Until that date the Military Institute, formerly the Ground Forces Institute of Odessa created in the fall of 1992, carried the traditions of the academy.  Specialties  Training is conducted in 12 military accounting specialties: * Mechanized formations * Airborne, mountain infantry and marine units * Special intelligence * Military intelligence * Special purpose units (except naval) * Special purpose units of the Ukrainian Navy * Communication units * Material and technical means * Food supply * Material support * Repair of small arms and melee weapons * Psychology Cadet activities and traditions A cadet of the school in Paris. On 14 July 2014, a contingent from the academy took part in the Bastille Day military parade dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War in Paris. A group of cadets and military musicians led by Lieutenant Colonel Mykola Konovalyuk took part in parade training for a week prior on the Champs Elysees, with another Ukrainian delegation of seven representatives of the school who speak French and English marching in a color guard procession and participating in other theatrical actions.https://www.mil.gov.ua/news/2014/07/07/grupa-vijskovosluzhbovcziv- vijskovoi-akademii-virushila-u-parizh-dlya-uchasti-u-vijskovomu-paradi/ Cadets of the academy in 2016 took part in the Chi»ôinƒÉu Independence Day Parade on Great National Assembly Square.http://www.army.md/?lng=3&action;=show&cat;=122&obj;=3976#.WaNz-MtOkwj = Awards = * 37x37pxMedal \\"For the Defence of Odessa\\" =Academy band= The Band of the Odessa Military Academy () was established in December 2012 and has its origin from the 9th Military Band of the Soviet Army (established in 1964) and the local Song and Dance Ensemble (established in 1939).

They were based in East Karelia in the Soviet territory and conducted long-range penetration reconnaissance and raids inside Finnish borders, often attacking weak targets such as remote border villages or ambushing vehicles. Around 170 Finnish civilians were killed and 50 wounded in the raids. Partisan activity and raids Around 2,400 Soviet partisans at most operated on the Karelian Front. They targeted enemy soldiers and officers, bridges, garrisons and railways. Unlike Soviet partisans elsewhere, they lacked continuously operating headquarters behind the enemy lines and often stayed there for just 15‚Äì20 days at a time. Their goals inside Finnish borders were to destroy military communications, disrupt economic activity of the Finnish population, and cause panic and uncertainty.Erkkil√§ 2011, p. 224 The partisans in Finland were controlled by organs of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the NKVD. The three most important people co-ordinating the partisan activity were the NKVD major general Sergey Vershinin, the First Secretary of the Karelian Communist Party Gennady Kupriyanov, and the First Secretary of the Karelo- Finnish Komsomol Yuri Andropov, who later became the leader of the Soviet Union. Andropov's responsibility was to train the Karelian partisans.Erkkil√§ 2011, p. 28 The headquarters were located in Belomorsk on the shore of the White Sea.Erkkil√§ 2011, p. 26 The three most prominent partisan groups were named Poljarnik, Bolshevik and Stalinets. Ten percent of the partisans in the groups were women. Besides the Soviet partisans, airborne reconnaissance troops and spies () of the Soviet military also operated inside the Finnish borders.Martikainen 2002, p. 74 The Finnish Army organized a special unit called Sau for anti-partisan activities. A partisan brigade was destroyed in Northern Karelia by the Finnish Army in mid-1942.Erkkil√§ 2011, p. 30 Finnish preparations in the north of the country for partisan activity have later been criticized as lacking. The German military stationed in Lapland wanted to control the Finnish civilian population more strictly, conduct evacuations and issue German identification cards because they believed some civilians were giving information to the partisans, but the Finnish authorities rejected these plans. The Finnish Air Force also had too few resources to help with anti-partisan duties.Erkkil√§ 2011, pp. 70‚Äì71; Martikainen 2002, pp. 10‚Äì15 The partisans often presented highly falsified accounts of the raids inside the Finnish territory. Civilian villages were called military garrisons in the official reports.Erkkil√§ 2011, pp. 8‚Äì9 The raids on villages turned more brutal in mid-1944, when they were co-ordinated with the Soviet Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk OffensiveErkkil√§ 2011, pp. 27‚Äì31 and incursions inside Finnish territory involved partisan detachments as large as 200 fighters during this time.Erkkil√§ 2011, p. 29 In total, between 170 and 182 Finnish civilians died in the attacks, 50 were wounded and 20 went missing.Erkkil√§ 2011, back cover. =Seitaj√§rvi massacre= Finnish civilians killed in Seitaj√§rvi on 7 July 1944 Forty-eight Soviet partisans attacked the village of Seitaj√§rvi in the municipality of Savukoski at 3:00 a.m. on 7 July 1944. The village was protected by nine soldiers of the Finnish Army. Barking dogs awakened the villagers, but the Finnish soldiers, taken by surprise, were quickly overrun by the partisans. The latter lured the civilians to come out of hiding by promising that they would not be hurt, speaking to them in Finnish. Then the partisans took the civilians with them and set most of the buildings in the village on fire. The Finnish anti-partisan unit Sau arrived on the scene nine hours after the attack and found dead bodies with the help of search dogs in a nearby forest. The women and children who were taken as prisoners by the partisans had been killed by shooting and stabbing them with knives and bayonets. Some of the women had also been raped.Erkkil√§ 2011, pp. 51‚Äì56 Fourteen civilians and two Finnish soldiers had been killed altogether. One eight-year-old girl who had been stabbed played dead and survived. The anti-partisan unit Sau kept tracking the partisans and found the trail of the troops. They fought until the morning and killed 33 partisans in total, but the main bulk of the partisans had managed to escape over the Kemijoki river. According to the official Soviet report which falsified information, the partisans destroyed a \\"Finnish garrison\\" and killed 94 men. In the aftermath of the attack, a doctor from neutral Sweden was requested to perform autopsies on the victims. The administrative board of the Norrbotten County sent a doctor named Richard Lindgren to perform the task. Two Swedish newspapers, the Norrbottens-Kuriren and Norrl√§ndska Socialdemokraten, followed him to report on the attacks. The autopsies found that the civilians had been either shot in the head or neck. A five-year-old girl called Valma had been stabbed to the head with a knife and seven-month-old Ritva had died from blunt force trauma to the head. The rapes could not be unambiguously proven in the autopsies, as the bodies had already been washed and had also decomposed since it had been nine days since the attack happened. Based on physical marks on the bodies and the position of the bodies on the scene, it was concluded that rapes had happened and this was reported by the Norrl√§ndska Socialdemokraten.Erkkil√§ 2011, pp. 96‚Äì97 =Lokka massacre= Memorial to the victims in Lokka Twenty- one civilians were killed in the village of Lokka, Sodankyl√§, on 14 July 1944. The partisan group Stalinets attacked the village from three directions at 7:45 p.m. after one partisan had been caught nearby and fired at with a rifle by a Finnish civilian. The school building where the civilians were hiding was then set on fire by the partisans. The partisans shot at people who tried to help them escape the burning structure through a window. Hilja Kumpula and five of her children perished in the fire, the youngest of whom was a one- month-old baby. The detachment managed to escape unharmed before units of the Finnish Army could reach them. Gennady Kupriyanov, who was leading the partisan activity, claimed in his report that the village was a \\"heavily fortified garrison\\". In reality, the NKVD had accurate intelligence on the village and the partisans had been monitoring it for days, knowing it had no combatants.Erkkil√§ 2011, pp. 72‚Äì82; Martikainen 2002, pp. 48‚Äì49 Legacy The partisan attacks were not a widely-known topic in Finland until the 1990s. This was in part due to the official Finnish position of friendly relations with the Soviet Union after the war, which even made them a sort of ‚Äúforbidden topic‚Äù, and some publishers avoided books about it. This changed when journalist and author Veikko Erkkil√§ published his book Vaiettu sota () in 1998. Public awareness and debate ensued and Erkkil√§ was given a state award for an information publication () by the Finnish Government. In Russia, the Soviet partisans in Finland are held in high regard as heroes of the Great Patriotic War. A conference of reconciliation was held in Sodankyl√§ in September 2002. It was attended by 150 people, including Finnish and Russian researchers, victims of the partisan attacks and two Soviet partisan veterans. The former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Elisabeth Rehn acted as patroness for the conference. There, the long-standing silence on the raids and also the war-time response of the Finnish authorities were criticized. =Criminal investigation= Olavi Alakulppi, a captain in the Finnish Army who witnessed the aftermath of the Seitaj√§rvi raid, tried to influence a United Nations commission to investigate the Soviet partisan attacks in Finland as a war crime. He served in the United States Army after the war and during his stay in the United States he submitted evidence and a formal testimony about the partisans, including photos of the victims and reports from Swedish newspapers about the attacks. In 1960, the Soviet envoy to the United Nations strongly denied that they had committed crimes against civilian population and even questioned whether Alakulppi had actually served in the Finnish Army. The Finnish UN permanent representative Ralph Enckell refused to take a stance on the issue and the case was not pursued further. In October 1998, Christian Democratic MP P√§ivi R√§s√§nen submitted a parliamentary question asking the government how they would investigate the partisan war crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice. The question was answered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Tarja Halonen who stated that the investigation would require co-operation from Russia. After the parliamentary inquiry, the office of the Prosecutor General of Finland decided to review the issue, as murder does not expire under the Finnish law. They concluded that the partisan attacks should be investigated as murders, but that the case should not be pursued by the Prosecutor General, and instead referred the investigation to the National Bureau of Investigation. Finland and Russia only had a treaty on general cooperation on legal matters, not a treaty on extradition, so in case of charges extraditions would have had to happen based on Russian court orders. In 2003, Russia informed Finnish authorities that the alleged crimes had expired under the 1926 Soviet criminal code, which ruled that murder expires in ten years, and that they would not provide further information from the archives. The National Bureau of Investigation dropped the case after this. =Victim compensation= The Finnish Parliament approved legislation which granted a sum of 1,500 euro for the victims of the partisan attacks in September 2003. The compensation was granted to people whose illness had been caused by a partisan attack, including emotional distress, or if they had lost one or both parents. It was estimated that there were 600‚Äì700 Finns eligible for the compensation. Previously only physical injuries were compensated.  Declassification of victim pictures  In November 2006, the Finnish Defence Forces declassified slightly over 300 war-time pictures that had been considered ‚Äúpolitically delicate‚Äù or too brutal for a broad audience. Dozens of them were related to the Soviet partisan raids. These included pictures of villages burned by the partisans, bodies of the victims, including children, and old men being armed with rifles to defend their villages. Previously only researchers or relatives of the victims could access these pictures with a special permission. The declassified pictures were widely discussed in the Finnish media.  List of villages raided by the partisans  The following is a list of villages raided by the Soviet partisans in alphabetical order.Martikainen 2002, pp. 259‚Äì263; Erkkil√§ 1998 See also *Soviet partisans in Estonia *Military history of Finland during World War II *Finland‚ÄìRussia border Notes References * Erkkil√§, Veikko: Vaiettu sota: Neuvostoliiton partisaanien iskut suomalaisiin kyliin (in Finnish).

Early life and cricket career Howard-Smith was born at Earl's Court on 21 January 1880 to Mary Beaumont O'Shaughnessy and her husband Philip Howard- Smith. He was educated at Eton College, before going onto study law at Trinity College, Cambridge. He made his debut in first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1900. The following year he made his debut for Cambridge University in first- class matches against AJ Webbe's XI, taking a five wicket haul on debut with figures of 6/23 in AJ Webbe's XI's first-innings. From 1900 to 1903, he would make 20 appearances in first-class cricket; 17 for Cambridge University and three for the MCC. Playing primarily as a right-arm fast bowler, Howard-Smith was a reliable, if not overly effective bowler, taking 29 wickets at an average of 44.10, with one five wicket haul. He gained his Cambridge blue in 1903. While studying at Trinity he was the president of both Cambridge University Cricket Club and Cambridge University Athletic Club. Howard-Smith also won the varsity high jump against Oxford in 1901, 1902 and 1903, also competing in Canada. After qualifying as a solicitor, he moved to Wolverhampton, where he joined the law firm Underhill, Thorneycroft & Smith and Neve, Co. He played club cricket locally for Wolverhampton Cricket Club, captaining the club. He was selected to play minor counties cricket for Staffordshire, playing in 1908 against Hertfordshire at Stoke-on-Trent, and once more in 1910 against Cheshire at Wolverhampton. These were his only appearances in the Minor Counties Championship. War service and death Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, Howard-Smith was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the South Staffordshire Regiment. His unit moved to frontline in March 1915, where shortly thereafter he was promoted to lieutenant and became the battalion bombing officer. He was awarded the Military Cross on 14 January 1916, for bravery during the Actions of the Hohenzollern Redoubt. He was known as the \\"anarchist\\" in his battalion due to his left-wing views. During the course of the war he was wounded three times, the third time fatally during action at Neuville-Saint-Vaast, France. Stretchered from the battfield whistling It's a Long Way to Tipperary, he died shortly thereafter from complications at a field hospital on 29 March 1916. He is buried at the Aubigny Communal Cemetery Extension and is commemorated at St Mary's Church, Bushbury.

History The god was worshiped and cult of Mithraism spread to other parts of Roman Empire, throughout the Mediterranean basin, by slaves and merchants from the Orient, and by Roman soldiers who came into contact with the followers of the cult in the East. Discovery and protection The remains of the Mithraeum in Konjic were discovered January 1897. The Konjic site is atypical as its floor level is at ground level. This means that temple main characteristic is absence of cave, hollow ground or even constructed spelaea. The Mithraism followers sought as a norm to found their places of worship in caves, whereas in absence of such topographical features they would excavate the soil, where the terrain permitted, and built small single-celled temple, known as spelaea, to reinforce the impression of a cave. However, in case of Konjic, temple was established on open ground, and only protection and seclusion was provided by dense forest, which disappeared by times of its discovery. Temple is declared National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Despite starring on the series for all five seasons, Shannon claims to only have watched a \\"little bit\\" of the show. Character arcs Nelson Van Alden is noted for being one of the few characters to have multiple arcs throughout the series, motivated by a downward spiral of going from lawman to criminal. At the start of the series, Van Alden acts as Nucky Thompson's (Steve Buscemi) primary antagonist, as he takes the lead to bring the kingpin down. However, in the midst of trying to tackle one of Prohibition's most notorious bootleggers, Van Alden's volatile temper and self-loathing start to blur his ethics; and by the end of Season 1, he has killed his corrupt partner Agent Eric Sebso (Erik Wiener) and violated his religious values through a one-night stand with Nucky Thompson's ex-mistress. Season 2 follows Van Alden's fruitless efforts to conceal his crimes from the previous season. The second season ends with Van Alden discovering he is the prime suspect in Sebso's murder, and he spends Season 3 on the run with his infant daughter and nanny Sigrid (Christiane Seidel), eventually settling in Chicago under the alias George Mueller. By the end of Season 4, Van Alden becomes an associate/muscle for Dean O'Banion (Arron Shiver) and eventually Al Capone (Stephen Graham), still going by the name George Mueller to avoid them discovering he is a former agent on the run. The final season sees Van Alden struggling to keep the lifestyle of associate/muscle George Mueller balanced during his second failing marriage, this time to Sigrid. Van Alden has since been partnered with Thompson's brother Eli (Shea Whigham), who knows Van Alden's true identity. Mike D'Angelo (Louis Cancelmi), an undercover agent in Capone's crew, recognizes Van Alden, and both he and Eli agree to work with D'Angelo to help take Capone down. Van Alden also learns that Eli is having an affair with Sigrid. Eli and Van Alden eventually return to Capone's hotel to steal ledgers as proof of his tax evasion, but Capone's brother Ralph (Domenick Lombardozzi) becomes suspicious of their behavior. The Capone brothers confront them, with D'Angelo present, not knowing he is working undercover. With Van Alden's deteriorating home life and facing death at the hands of the Capones, he snaps and attacks the brothers while Eli and Malone watch in shock. In a rage, Van Alden confesses his true identity while choking Capone, but before he can successfully strangle him, Malone shoots and kills Van Alden in order to ensure that he is not exposed as a federal agent. The Capones then foolishly entrust Malone with the ledgers. Van Alden's death unwittingly leads to Capone going to prison for tax evasion. Reception Nelson Van Alden has been frequently cited as a fan-favorite on Boardwalk Empire. The role earned Shannon three nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Captured guns may have been used by Austria-Hungary.  History  The 149/23 was designed and built by Gio. Ansaldo & C. and entered service in 1882. It was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar guns such as the de Bange 155 mm cannon. However, by the time the First World War broke out, it was obsolescent and in need of replacement. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Italian Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. The majority of combatants scrambled to find anything that could fire a heavy shell and that meant emptying the fortresses and designing field carriages for converted coastal and naval artillery. Design The 149/23 was a short barreled breech-loading cannon on a rigid two-wheeled box trail carriage. The barrel was a typical built-up gun of the period with a mix of steel and iron construction. The gun had an interrupted screw breech and it fired separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. Like many of its contemporaries, the 149/23 carriage was tall and narrow with two wooden 12-spoke wheels of diameter. This was because the guns were designed to sit behind a parapet with the barrel overhanging the front. Since the guns weren't expected to go very far they weren't designed with mobility in mind. Like many of its contemporaries, its carriage did not have a recoil mechanism. However, when used in a fortress the guns could be connected to an external recoil mechanism which connected to a steel eye on the concrete firing platform and a hook on the carriage between the wheels. A set of wooden ramps were also placed behind the wheels and when the gun fired the wheels rolled up the ramp and was returned to position by gravity. There was also no traversing mechanism and the gun had to be levered into position to aim. A drawback of this system was the gun had to be re-aimed each time which lowered the rate of fire. To facilitate towing on soft ground and lessen recoil the wheels were often fitted with Bonagente grousers patented by the Italian major Crispino Bonagente. These consisted of twelve rectangular plates connected with elastic links and are visible in many photographs of World War I artillery from all of the combatants. The combination of Bonagente grousers and ramps were usually enough to handle recoil for field use. For towing the tail of the gun hooked onto a limber for towing by a horse team or artillery tractor.  Coastal Artillery  In addition to its siege role, the 149/23 was deployed in the coastal artillery role. In this role, the guns were mounted in thick dome shaped steel gun turrets that were set in concrete fortifications. There was also a version on an unprotected garrison mount garrison mount with limited traverse. The recoil system for this version consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffers slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned the gun to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity.  The Cannon of Adamello  The Cannon of Adamello is a 149/23 that can still be visited on the Cresta Croce, in the Adamello Range, where it had been brought to support operations in the mountains. The cannon arrived in Tem√π from the Edolo railway station on February 9th 1916 and was transported by road to Malga Caldea at an altitude of . From there it was broken down into two large sled loads which were towed by 200 artillerymen and engineers up to Rifugio Giuseppe Garibaldi at an altitude of on 17 April. Finally, on 27 April the gun reached the Passo del Venerocolo. On the night of 6 June 1917, the gun was transferred to Cresta Croce at and on 15 June began to bombard the positions of the Kaiserj√§ger of Lieutenant Felix Hecht von Eleda on the Corno di Cavento.

The organization uses concerts, workshops, and events, and innovative partnerships to provide outreach and education.  History  Hope For The Day was founded in 2011 by Jonny Boucher after losing sixteen people to suicide, including his boss and mentor, Mike Scanland, in 2010. Boucher began working in the music industry at an early age as a concert promoter, and initially promoted HFTD by passing out fliers with information on mental health resources at music venues, churches, libraries, and schools. The organization also uses speaking engagements at local Chicago venues to raise awareness. HFTD has partnered with bands and organizations such as Beartooth, Neck Deep, and Havas. Hope for the Day's approach to suicide prevention is motivated by the fact that suicide prevention nationwide and across the world lack a unified framework for guiding action. This Action Plan for decreasing suicide rates has 3 complementary, interlocking components: 1\\\\. Outreach: Starting the Conversation. Starting the Conversation through Outreach: Peervention starts with a conversation by meeting people where they‚Äôre at, not where we expect them to be, and raising the visibility of community mental health resources. 2\\\\. Education: Advancing the Conversation. This involves ensuring that individuals, institutions, and communities are educated on proper mental health care, and how to respond to mental health challenges. 3\\\\. Take Action: Empowering the Conversation. Empowers community members to be organizers who build opportunities and promote mental health in their own networks.  Sip of Hope  Hope For the Day established Sip of Hope, a coffee bar in Chicago's Logan Square neighborhood in the winter of 2016. Boucher partnered with Jesse Diaz, founder of Dark Matter Coffee, a Chicago based coffee brewing company. Sip of Hope opened on May 3 of 2018. Senator Dick Durbin and others attended to give their support for Hope for the Day's mission. The coffee shop donates all of their profits to suicide prevention projects, mental health education, and serve as outreach. Sip of Hope staff are trained and certified in mental health first aid to assist customers who seek information about mental health challenges. The staff provides aid through conversation and resources about mental wellness.  Partnerships  =Dark Matter Coffee= Hope for the Day has partnered with Chicago's Dark Matter Coffee for years, with this alliance crystallizing in 2017 when they decided to launch a social enterprise coffee shop together to be named Sip of Hope (SOH). Opened in May 2018, Sip of Hope quickly became a community beacon of hope, representing the need to come together as a community and Start the Conversation on suicide and mental health anywhere and everywhere. =Mastodon= In 2017, the friendship between Mastodon's Brann Dailor (drums/vocals) and Jonny Boucher resulted in the band performing at Chicago's The Metro in honor of Brann's sister, Skye, and in support of HFTD's suicide prevention programming. Mastodon played their highly acclaimed 2009 album, Crack the Skye, in its entirety. The album pays homage to Skye, who died by suicide at the age of 14. =Beartooth = On December 13, 2016, the American post-hardcore band Beartooth created a charity auction in support of HFTD. = Neck Deep = Ben Barlow, lead vocalist of Welsh pop punk band Neck Deep, was interviewed by Boucher at Vans Warped Tour in 2017. He spoke about Neck Deep sharing similar goals with HFTD. =Vans Warped Tour= Johnny Boucher toured with the Vans Warped Tour. The tour had a tent at each venue where they distributed resources and acted as a place for people to seek help. Boucher went on stage and let people know that it is \\"OK Not To Be OK.\\" = Chicago Digital = Chicago Digital, a digital marketing and web design company, worked with Hope for the Day to create a website that promotes the organization to a wider audience. The website was made to update news to HFTD staff and included a custom web app to help users find outreach programs near them. =Havas Chicago = In September 2018, advertising company Havas Chicago created a public art display to support Hope for The Day. The art installation featured 121 mannequins dressed in shirts that read the slogan \\"It's OK Not To Be OK\\". The mannequins symbolized the average suicide deaths per day of 121 suicides. The display also acted as a fundraiser known as #121ToNone, where a mannequin would be removed for every $121 dollars donated or whenever 121,000 times the hashtag #121ToNone was shared on Instagram. The display was located at Havas Chicago's lobby at 36 E. Grand Ave in downtown Chicago. = Nickel A Day Films = HFTD teamed up with AnnMarie Parker of Nickel A Day Films to direct and create a short film based in the Chicago suburb of Naperville. The film entitled I'm Fine is about a group of friends coping after a young teenage girl commits suicide. The film revolves around the pressures on being successful and meeting the expectations of families, schools, and friends in Naperville and DuPage County.  Education  = PEERvention Workshops = Starting in 2016, HFTD holds free monthly health seminars at the Logan Square Public Library to educate the public on mental health and suicide prevention.

Biography Peter H√§berlin was born in 1912 in Kreuzlingen near Konstanz on Lake Constance (the Obersee Bodensee) and grew up in Singen, in Germany, just across the Swiss border. From 1928-1931 he took up an apprenticeship with a pastry chef in Berneck, Switzerland, at the eastern end of Lake Constance.  Travel  At 21 years old H√§berlin set out from his home in Canton Thurgau to walk to Africa and from 1932 to 1934 journeyed on foot from Switzerland to Italy stopping at Capri and Positano, before proceeding on to Palermo, where he embarked on a ship to Tunisia and Algeria where he saw the desert and stopped at the oasis of Biskra before heading farther south to the city of Touggourt. In Constantine, Algeria, H√§berlin worked in the famous P√¢tisserie Viennoise to restore his travel funds. He returned via Morocco and Gibraltar and subsequently made other trips in Europe during which, in 1935 in Stockholm, he attempted to meet the Swedish explorer Sven Hedin, who was known for his explorations of Asia, also in large desert areas, reported in his books published since the nineteenth century that were read avidly by H√§berlin.  Photographer  In 1938/9 H√§berlin studied sculpture and photography at the Hansischen Hochschule, Hamburg until WW2 forced him out of Germany. He then enrolled in photography at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Z√ºrich from 1940 to 1943 where he studied under Hans Finsler, a major proponent of Neue Sachlichkeit. After his graduation H√§berlin's work was published in Atlantis and Du. In 1948 he married Jolita Coughlin, an American student (whose portrait was taken by Edward Weston, and is in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). H√§berlin undertook four extensive tours of North Africa over 1949-1952, often retracing his previous journeys, on the established caravan routes, on foot, by bicycle and on transport, crossing the Saharan desert until he reached North Cameroon. He photographed the peoples and architecture in locations including Colomb-B√©char (now B√©char), northern Algeria, in El Golea, central-northern Algeria, in a Tuareg camp near the Hoggar mountains, French Sudan (now Mali), Salah, central Algeria, northern Sahara, and Ghardaia cemetery, northern Algeria.Captions from H√§berlin made scant written documentation of his journeys, and what biographical detail there is about him during this period is gleaned from his few letters home to his wife Jolita, and from the photographs themselves.  Recognition  His frank, full-face photograph of a young woman with braided hair and decorative cicatrices on her cheeks and nose, taken in bright desert sunlight, is typical of his work in Northern Africa; made out of his curiosity about a timeless, unspoilt culture. It was selected by curator Edward Steichen for the world- touring Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Family of Man, seen by 9 million visitors and published in a catalogue which has sold 4 million copies and has never been out of print. An Associated Press report of the time\\"Student Arrested for Slashing Photographs in THE FAMILY OF MAN in Moscow.\\" The Associated Press report read: ‚ÄúMoscow, August 6, All. A medical student from Nigeria has been arrested by Soviet Police for slashing four photographs in the U.S. Exhibition. The Nigerian was arrested Wednesday after he cut up pictures from the photographic series, 'The Family of Man‚Äô which he clearly disliked. One picture showed an African dance. Another was a large tattooed face. A third was a hunter holding up a deer. The fourth showed African lips drinking water from a gourd. Exhibition officials withdrew the damaged pictures and said an effort will be made to restore them.‚Äù suggests that the picture may have been amongst those torn down in Moscow by the Nigerian student Theophilus Neokonkwo while The Family of Man was being exhibited there at its last venue in 1959. His actions were in a protest at colonialist attitudes to black races Death and legacy Shortly after returning from his last trip, H√§berlin died in a tragic accident in Z√ºrich in 1953, in the midst of his preparations for a new expedition to Mexico. His estate was bequeathed to the Fotostiftung Switzerland, Winterthur. Some of his photographs were published posthumously in 1956 in the book Yallah, completed by H√§berlin‚Äôs father with the help of the American author Paul Bowles and with a foreword by Bowles who in 1933 also trekked through the Algerian Sahara to Tunisia.Hout, Syrine C. (2000). Grains of Utopia: The Desert as Literary Oasis in Paul Bowles's The Sheltering Sky and Wilfred Thesiger's Arabian Sands(*).(Critical Essay). Utopian Studies, 11(2), 112-136. The New Yorker in a 1957 review reported that it was the work ‚Äúof one of the great photographers of our times, capable of showing, as only art can, what would otherwise have remained hidden‚Äù, and other reviewers discern a poetic dimension to pictures that in other contexts would be documentary.Metcalf, P. (1982). 'A Journey in Search of Bowles'. In Review of Contemporary Fiction, 2(3), 32. Without the book, H√§berlin would likely have remained unknown. Publications  * Exhibitions *Peter W.

She was engaged in the Old American Company.Dunlap, William, A history of the American theatre Elizabeth Walker Morris was married to the actor Owen Morris (d. 1809) in his second marriage. She is first noted to have performed as a member of the Old American Company in the Southwark Theatre in Philadelphia in 1772. As a member of that troupe she toured through the colonies and to the West Indies before returning to New York in 1785. Elizabeth Walker Morris was described as a tall beauty with a preference for high heels and a dislike for attention outside of the stage. She was referred to as one of the greatest theatrical stars of the 18th- century American theatre and very popular in her time, also within contemporary press reviews and critics. The Pennsylvania Biographical Dictionary described her as \\"the greatest attraction of the American stage [...] especially in higher comedy.\\" She reportedly became the first actress in America to play the role of Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing on 18 March 1789 in Philadelphia.Charles E. L. Wingate, Shakespeare's Heroines on the Stage, 1895 However, Elizabeth Walker Morris was reportedly involved in a conflict with her colleague Maria Henry, supported by Thomas Wignell, while John Henry was in conflict with Owen Morris, conflicts which eventually resulted in them leaving the company. In 1792, the Morris couple left the American Company to form their own theatre company in collaboration with Thomas Wignell; then just the third theatre company in America. Together they performed in the first theatrical season ever given in the history of Boston. From 1794 to 1810, she performed at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia.

It is an Indo- Pacific species and is the only species in the monospecific genus Ellochelon. Description The squaretail mullet is olive-brown on its back with silvery flanks and a white or yellowish belly. It has six longitudinal stripes along its sides which are formed by darker longitudinal markings on the scales which also have darkened edges creating a slight chequered appearance on the flanks. The iris has yellow patches. The fins have dark margins which contrasts with their mainly yellowish cast but the caudal fin is obviously yellow and in smaller specimens the pectoral fin is totally black but the lower part becomes yellowish in older fish. Distribution The squaretail mullet occurs from the Red Sea and the coast of East Africa, as far south as Mozambique, eastwards through the Indo-pacific to New Caledonia and the Great Barrier Reef and north to southern Japan. Habitat and biology The squaretail mullet can be found in lagoons, estuaries, sheltered sandy shorelines and coastal creeks and can enter freshwater, having been found up to up rivers, although they normally do not move further inland than the influence of the tides. They can form large aggregations among mangroves and the juveniles are frequently recorded in rice paddies and mangroves. They feed on phytoplankton, algae and detritus. Spawning is at sea, and the eggs are pelagic and do not adhere to aobjects. Human utilisation The smaller fish are caught for use as bait fish. It is also locally exploited as a food fish being marketed fresh; its roe is also sold and eaten. It is fished for using beach seines, gillnets, cast nets and stake nets.

History  The Markup was co-founded by two former ProPublica journalists Julia Angwin and Jeff Larson, and executive and journalist Sue Gardner. The project was announced in April 2018, with an expected launch in early 2019. Like ProPublica, all of their content will be licensed under a Creative Commons license. According to Angwin, in 2018, the portal planned to collect and create public datasets through public records requests, automated data collection, crowdsourcing information, and creating tools. In April 2019, Gardner fired Angwin as editor-in-chief. Larson was named as her replacement. In a letter to Craig Newmark, The Markup's largest donor, Angwin asked him to intervene, claiming she was pushed out after resisting Gardner's attempts to change The Markup's mission to \\"one based on advocacy against the tech companies.\\" Six out of seven journalists on staff resigned following Angwin's ouster. Gardner denied changing the mission, telling The New York Times, \\"We are, pure and simple, a news outlet, we always have been and always will be. Our goals and purpose haven‚Äôt changed.\\". According to Larson and Gardner, the reasons for Angwin's ouster had instead included disagreements over the non-journalistic responsibilities of Angwin's role as an executive, such as the organization falling behind in its hiring plans and the launch timeline. A month later, Newmark announced that Gardner and Larson had left The Markup, and there were reports about plans to bring back Angwin as editor-in-chief. On August 6, 2019, The Markup announced that Julia Angwin would return as editor-in-chief, along with Nabiha Syed as president and much of the original team ‚Äì but without Larson or Gardner. Syed was previously BuzzFeed‚Äôs general counsel and vice president.  Funding  The Markup received a $20 million gift from Craigslist founder Craig Newmark.

There is a significant history of such sterilization practices being conducted involuntarily, in a coerced or forced manner, as well as in more subtle forms such as that of constrained choice. Some sources credit the practice to theories of racial eugenics.  In Women of Different Latina Identity  = Puerto Rican women = Puerto Rican women in particular have served as test subjects for various contraceptive studies in the United States, of which included involuntary sterilization. Many Puerto Rican women were sterilized from the 1930s to the 1970s in order to decrease poverty and population growth in Puerto Rico. To decrease the population size of Puerto Ricans, a grant was given to the United States to provide free sterilizations at the workplaces of Puerto Rican women. Though the sterilization was free, these women were often not given proper information about sterilization. = Mexican women = In Los Angeles, between 1969‚Äì1973, Mexican and Chicana (Mexican-American) women were also disproportionately targeted by involuntary sterilizations. A number of these women would go on to join a class action lawsuit, Madrigal v. Quilligan, discussed below. Many of these sterilizations were done involuntarily and without consent. Oftentimes, these women signed off on paperwork without being able to read the English language. Other times, they were told it was necessary in order to maintain their welfare benefits. It became common to sterilize women after giving birth whether by tubal ligation or hysterectomy. Even when the women did consent, it was often under false pretenses that the procedure could be reversed if they decided to have children again in the future.  In Different States  = In California = Involuntary sterilization programs were in some instances supported and funded by the states. In California, the rationale for forced sterilization was primarily for eugenics purposes, although this later shifted to a fear of overpopulation and welfare dependency. California passed the third law in the United States that allowed state institutions to sterilize ‚Äúunfit‚Äù and ‚Äúfeeble-minded‚Äù individuals. As eugenics gained credibility as a field in science, sterilization rates increased, especially after the 1927 Buck v. Bell U.S. Supreme Court decision, which upheld the constitutionality of sterilization laws in Virginia. According to available data, California performed one third of all reported sterilization procedures in the United States between 1910 and 1960. = In Texas = Low-income minority women were more dependent on sterilization than other groups.Potter, J., White, K., Hopkins, K., McKinnon, S., Shedlin, M., Amastae, J., & Grossman, D. (2012). Frustrated Demand for Sterilization Among Low‚ÄêIncome Latinas in El Paso, Texas. Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, 44(4), 228‚Äì235. In a study conducted in El Paso, Texas groups of women were asked why they would choose sterilization; many of the top reasons included: not wanting any more children, their current age and health, plans of working or attending school or inability to afford another child.  Related Court Cases  =Madrigal v. Quilligan (1978)= In the 1970s a group of Chicana women brought up a federal class action lawsuit against a hospital in Los Angeles County regarding their sterilizations.Thompson, Sam. Madrigal v. Quilligan. (2006). 416‚Äì419. Women in the class were allegedly given false information regarding sterilization. The titular plaintiff, Dolores Madrigal, a Latina woman, was allegedly told several times by a medical professional that sterilization could be reversed. Other women involved in the case signed consent forms for their sterilizations because they were allegedly sedated or manipulated by doctors and medical staff. A common reason for forcing the sterilizations of these women was apparently the burden that their future children would be to ‚Äútaxpayers.‚Äù Many of the women did not discover that they had been sterilized until they visited a doctor. The judge deciding Madrigal held that it was a part of a doctor‚Äôs practice to provide sterilizations to these women based upon their cultural backgrounds. The judge, Judge Curtis, stated in his ruling that miscommunication between the doctors and the women, rather than malice, resulted in the sterilizations. In the words of his final comment, the judge stated, ‚ÄúOne can sympathize with them for their inability to communicate clearly, but one can hardly blame the doctors for relying on these indicia of consent which appeared to be unequivocal on their face and which are in constant use in the medical center.‚Äù  Further implications  thumb In 1979, the practice was abolished in California. It is estimated that approximately 20,000 women were sterilized in total. There have been talks in the California State Assembly to formally compensate the women who were involuntary sterilized.

Founded in 1823 prior to the use of the name Tasmania, it lasted for 68 years before becoming the first major bank failure of the 1890s depression in Australia. Although it had a reputation for reliability, during the 1880s the bank lent heavily to Tasmanians who invested heavily in silver mining ventures. When the mineral prices crashed in the 1890s the bank was unable to survive the number of defaulting loans. The bank closed its doors in August 1891, and offered up its banking premises as a ¬£1 lottery ticket. Following the bank's demise, a Royal Commission was established to investigate allegations of fraudulent activities. The headquarters of the bank stood on the corner of Collins and Elizabeth Streets in Hobart until 1958 when it was demolished.

Biography Peter Kerr was born 1775, to an enslaved woman named Kino, who was of Mandinka heritage. He and his mother lived in western Pennsylvania, where they were enslaved to a man named John Kerr Jr. Following Kerr's death, Peter was willed to his son, who moved to Ohio, a free state, in 1813. Peter was freed from servitude, and came into contact with a group known as \\"The Family,\\" which practiced a combination of Christian principles and communism. Many members of that group converted to Mormonism in the early 1830s, including Peter. There is, however, no official record of his baptism, but his membership was recognized by George A. Smith, another member of the church, and in local newspapers. He was notably accustomed to seeing \\"angels and letters [that] would come down from heaven...\\" and once jumped off a bridge to catch a letter, which he said was delivered by a black angel. He acted as a Revelator in the community, was ordained to the priesthood, and baptized others into the faith, along with Levi W. Hancock, Edson Fuller, and Herman Bassett. A colleague, Reuben Harmon, mentioned that \\"White women would chase him about...\\" and Peter soon entered into a relationship with fourteen-year-old Lovina Williams, of whom he said he had received revelation to marry. Lovina replied that if she received a revelation as well, she would marry him. Peter consulted the prophet Joseph Smith, about whether he should marry Lovina, but Smith said he could not receive personal revelation for him. Peter and Lovina did not marry, and, after 1831, there is no record of him. Some scholars have suggested that he died, being around 60 years old in 1835, when the average lifespan of an African-American man at the time was around forty.

It is a yellow-flowering annual or perennial herb native to North America and introduced to Ireland and The Netherlands. The specific epithet canadense means \\"Canadian\\". Description Hypericum canadense is a perennial herb that grows in short basal offshoots that are produced in autumn. The slender stems reach 5‚Äì75 cm in height and are simple or branched in their upper half. The stems are four-angled and slightly winged. The roots are fibrous and the herb lacks any rhizome or stolons. The leaves have characteristic pellucid dots and are linear to linear-oblanceolate. The leaves are rounded at their tip and narrow towards their sessile or subpetiolar base. The leaves are 1‚Äì4 cm long and 1‚Äì6 mm wide. Pairs of leaves are spirally arranged but not decussate, and lower leaves become more purplish, smaller, more elliptic, and crowded due to shortening of the internodes. The leaves are one to three nerved with secondary veins weaker except near the leaf base. The flowers are solitary or arranged in simple cymes. The cymes are naked save for the linear bracts. Branches of the inflorescence are divergent and form a somewhat corymbiform shape. The five linear-lanceolate sepals are blunt to acutish, measuring 2.5-4.5 mm long and 0.8‚Äì1 mm wide. The sepals are shortly united at their base with one being longer than the others. The five-veined yellow petals are oblong to oblanceolate and have rounded tips, measuring about as long as the sepals or shorter. The fifteen stamens are arranged in three loose fascicles. Both the filaments and anthers are yellow, the anthers being globose and about 0.25 mm wide. The ovoid, yellow pistil is 2 mm long, with indistinct carpels and one locule. The three styles are 0.25 mm long. The conical capsule is red or purplish, measuring 4-6.5 mm long and 2-2.5 mm wide. The capsule has persistent styles measuring about 0.5 mm long. The light brown and cylindrical seeds have conical or rounded ends, measuring 0.6 mm long. The herb flowers and fruits from late July to early September. It has a diploid number of 16. Hybrids and varieties In Nova Scotia, assumed hybrids between H. canadense and Hypericum mutilum subsp. boreale have occurred. These hybrids can be recognized as Hypericum √ó dissimulatum as they match material described by Eugene P. Bicknell from Nantucket. One variety, H. canadense var. magninsulare, differs in petal shape. Its petals are ovate or ovate-lanceolate and taper to an acute or obtuse apex. The reflexed petals are a pale yellow tinged with red towards their apex, with clear nerves. In typical H. canadense, the petals have a rounded or subtruncate apex, reflex only towards the end of flowering, lack any red tinge, and have exceedingly obscure nerves. Besides the petals, the variety has the same habit as the typical form. The variety is clearly more than a distinct color form, as some specimens, for example from White Head Island, have petals as pale or paler than the variety though in the same shape as a typical specimen. The distinctness in reflexing and color of petals is mostly lost in drying, and as such the variety is easily distinguishable in the field but difficult to make out in an herbarium. The variety has a distinct preference of habitat as well, preferring wet and open places in the same regions where typical specimens prefer more low-lying and more moist soils. Rarely do the two grow together. The variety name magninsulare is a Latinisation of Grand Manan, the island where the variety was first distinguished and is primarily distributed. Distribution It occurs naturally in eastern parts of Canada and the United States, from Ontario to Newfoundland, south to the northern parts of Florida, and east to Iowa. It is considered extirpated from Manitoba. H. canadense was discovered in Europe as early as 1935 near Almelo in the Netherlands, with previously collected specimens in 1909 determined to be H. canadense as well. The herb was reputed to have been discovered in 1959 in France but has since been shown to be erroneous, the specimens collected being H. majus. H. majus was found in Germany in 1956 and in both France and Germany the herb was likely introduced by American troops. H. canadense was first discovered in Ireland in 1954, with a single plant being found on the shore of Lough Mask. In 1968, the plant was discovered in Ireland again, this time south of Lough Mask in Glengarriff. The Irish plant is more similar to H. canadense var. magninsulare than to the type, given the red line on its petals and its intermediate petal shape, between the narrow, pointed shape of the variety and the lanceolate, rounded shape of the type. There are three possibilities for the presence of H. canadense in Europe. First, the plant could be introduced by human means. This is highly improbable, with it being unlikely that any European gardener would cultivate the plant and unlikely that any American troops could transport the plant, though that American hypothesis has been supposed. Second, the plant could have been transported to Ireland by natural means, most likely being carried on the feet of the Greenland white-fronted goose if by any bird. The goose breeds in Greenland and winters in North America or Ireland, but this hypothesis can only be considered if H. canadense is discovered in Greenland. The third possibility is that the plant is relict in Europe, supported by the fact that several other species considered relict have similar geographic distributions. The plant's occurrence in Newfoundland gives credence to its hardiness, suggesting that it could have withstood the latest glaciation. Najas flexilis is similar in hardiness and survived the last glaciation as fossil evidence shows. The attempted creation of the Corrib-Mask Canal lowered water levels in the herb's Irish area, and if the plant was underwater before then, the relict hypothesis would be disproven. An 1841 map shows that the distribution of H. canadense stops short of the lakeshore by . However, the plant clearly occurs below an older shore line of uncertain age; the shore line is certainly post-glacial, but it may be old enough for the plant to migrate down to its current occurrence. The abundance and conspicuousness of the plant opposes this theory, as in the 1950s a few plants were discovered simultaneously in France and Ireland, but more recently the plants are quite abundant, suggesting more recent naturalization of the herb. The majority of evidence is in favor of the relict hypothesis, but future spreading or lack thereof of the plant will better suggest recent introduction or the growth of an autochthon. Habitat Hypericum canadense occurs in wet or dry soils in sandy ditches and clearings, road verges, pastures, boggy or peaty regions, gravelly beaches, and occasionally in woodlands. It is considered a facultative wetland plant in the United States, meaning that it usually occurs in wetlands, but may also occur in non-wetlands, typically in areas where the soil surface is flooded at least seasonally.Lichvar, R.W., D.L. Banks, W.N. Kirchner, and N.C. Melvin. 2016. The National Wetland Plant List: 2016 wetland ratings. Phytoneuron 2016-30: 1-17. Published 28 April 2016. ISSN 2153-733XLichvar R.W. N.C. Melvin M.L. Butterwick and W.N. Kirchner. National Wetland Plant List Indicator Rating Definitions. ERDC/CRREL TR-12-1. U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory Hanover NH. In North Carolina, the herb occurs at elevations as high as . In the Chicago area, it is a highly conservative species, growing almost exclusively in undisturbed, remnant natural areas, primarily \\"high- watertable sand flats\\" and acidic wet to wet-mesic sand prairies. The variety H. canadense var. magninsulare prefers wet soils in pastures or swamps. In Ireland, the herb occurs in wet soils of pH between 4 and 5, with rich organic matter. The plant requires base-poor and peaty soils to occur in Ireland. Grazing by cattle likely reduces competition and provides open ground for establishment of the herb. Hypericum canadense and Hypericum majus overlap in most of their Canadian distribution. H. canadense is more eastern, occurring in the Maritimes towards Lake Superior. H. majus is rare in the Maritimes but occurs as far west as British Columbia. In the Maritimes H. canadense is restricted to mostly Paleozoic formations and in Ontario it prefers Precambrian formations. H. majus occurs in a broader range of habitats.

It is located in the southern margin of river terrace near the Senb≈çyama Site and is believed to be contemporary with the settlement at that location. It measures 24.5 meters on each side, with a height of 5.1 meters, with the protruding portion 7.2 meters long and 10.6 meters wide. (2,490 square meters) 3\\\\. The is a late Yayoi to early Kofun period keyhole-shaped kofun, located 110 meters northeast of the Rokuji Kozuka Kofun. Its design shows a transition phase between the rectangular tombs of the Yayoi period and the true keyhole-shaped tombs of the Kofun period, and is believed to have been built by the same people who settled the Senb≈çyama Site. The tomb has a 25.2 meter total length with the circular portion 16.5 meters in diameter and 1.7 meter high. (1,896 square meters) 4\\\\. The is a cluster of three late Yayoi period rectangular \\"corner protruding\\" tombs located on the right bank of the Yamadagawa River on the northern margin of Tomisaki hill. Tombs 1 and 2 are 21.7 meters on a side, with a height of 3 meters, and Tomb 3 is slightly larger at 22 meters per side with a height of 3.9 meters. In each case, the protrusion has a length of 6 meters. (8,118 square meters) 5\\\\. The is a necropolis built in the early Kofun period, of which 17 kofun (one key-hole shaped, one dome-shaped, and 15 rectangular-shaped) have thus been discovered. It is located in the east margin of the Tomisaki Hills.(27,651 square meters) 6\\\\. The is one of the oldest and the fourth largest keyhole-shaped kofun in Toyama Prefecture. It has a total length of 58 meters. The front portion is 27 meters by 26 meters and 3.6 meters high, and the rear portion is 31 meters by 33 meters with a height of 7.6 meters. As the mound is considerably weathered, it may have originally been even larger. This kofun has never been excavated, so its interior structure and the presence of any grave goods is unknown. (2,452 square meters) 7\\\\. The is a large tomb dating from the 3rd century. It measures 66 meters in total length, with a rear portion 31 meters x 24 meters with height of 3.5 meters and a front portion of 35 meters x 37 meters (narrowing to 11 meters in the waist) and a height of 9 meters. It was found to contain a rectangular burial chamber measuring 6.2 meters by 6.1 meters containing the remnants of a wooden sarcophagus and a large number of grave goods.

It is located at Kamerunga Road, Freshwater in Cairns.  Services  Although located in the suburb of Freshwater, it does not currently provide any commuter services. It is only used by Kuranda Scenic Railway tourist service which stops at this station and approximately 60% of the annual 400,000 tourists board the scenic railway service at this station.  History  Freshwater railway station, trackside, 2018 The Tablelands railway line was built to provide transport between the mines near Herberton and the Cairns Port. The contract for the first 8 miles from Cairns railway station to Redlynch railway station (passing through Freshwater) was opened on 8 October 1887. During the construction of the line, in March 1887, heavy rain caused the flooding of Freshwater Creek; at the point where the railway line crossed the creek, there was of water over the line. Shortly after the line was opened, further heavy rains damaged the approaches to the railway bridge over Freshwater Creek. Another of flooding occurred again at the Freshwater Creek crossing in January 1888. When the railway line opened, there were a number of railway sidings along the line: Stratford (5 miles from Cairns), Lily Bank (6 miles from Cairns), and Richmond (7 miles from Cairns). Richmond Siding was renamed Freshwater Siding in January 1890. The development of the railway line had encouraged land developers to release land subdivision called Richmond Park Estate which was sold from 1886 with advertising featuring the forthcoming Richmond Park railway station and its ten minute rail journey to Cairns; this explains the original name of the siding. In September 2018, a $4.8 million refurbishment was completed at Freshwater station. The work included extending the station platform to provide access to all 15 passager carriages on the Kuranda Scenic Rail service as well as improving bus and car parking facilities and additional facilities to assist disabled passengers.

The first daimy≈ç of Kaga Domain, Maeda Toshinori died at Takaoka Castle in 1614. In 1646, his brother, Maeda Toshinaga, the third daimy≈ç of Kaga Domain built a massive mausoleum in the outskirts of Takaoka. The tombstone itself is an eight-meter tall slab of granite on a three tier base, surrounded by stone fences and two concentric moats and three sides. At present, the area of the mausoleum covers approximately 10,000 sq.m. however, as a result of an archaeological survey conducted in 2007, its original extent was three times larger (i.e. 33,000 sq.m.) which is consistent with the dimensions found in historical records preserved by the Maeda clan. This makes it the largest tomb by far of any Sengoku period warlord. It was clearly designed for secondary use as a fortification in times of emergency. At present, the inner moat is largely filled in, and much of the outer area is part of the adjacent Takaoka Municipal Yoshiko Junior High School grounds or the Takaoka Municipal Maeda Tennis Courts.. On January 1, 1965, it was designated as a Toyama prefectural historic site, and on February 12, 2009, along with the Maeda clan cemetery in Nodayama in the city of Kanazawa it was designated a national historic site. =Nodayama Maeda clan cemetery= is a cemetery containing the graves of the Edo period daimy≈ç of Kaga Domain, located in the city of Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture . The Nodayama cemetery is located to the south of the city center of Kanazawa, and is the largest public cemetery in the city. In addition to the tombs of successive generations of the Maeda clan, who served as daimy≈ç over the provinces of Kaga, Noto and Etch≈´ Provinces under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate, the cemetery also has the graves of noted local residents and also numerous graves of the war dead from the region. The area protected under the National Historic Site designation is only the portion containing the Maeda clan graves, and covers and area of 86,294.35 square meters. Within the Nodayama cemetery are the graves of some 80 members of the Maeda clan, including daimy≈ç, official wives, and various children. The graves are unusual in that they take the form of dome-shaped tumuli in three layers, with a grave marker in front of each tumulus, resembling ancient dome-shaped kofun. Most of the daimy≈ç graves have a diameter of 16 meters, with the exception of the grave of Maeda Toshiie, which is the largest at 19-meters. The size of these graves is unparalleled by other daimy≈ç graveyards. Surrounding the tombs of each daimy≈ç and his family are many smaller tombs for important retainers of the clan, as well as numerous Edo-period tombs of important residents of Kanazawa.

It was designed and built by William Cox between 1814 and 1825, with the assistance of a convict road party. It is also known as Bathurst Road; Old Bathurst Road and Coxs Road. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 March 2015.  History  The road from Emu Ford to Bathurst, a distance of was completed in only six months during 1814 and 1815 by a working party composed mostly of convicts. Governor Lachlan Macquarie decided to have a carriage road constructed across the Blue Mountains, to the country which had been \\"newly discovered\\" by Europeans in 1813. The so-called \\"First Crossing\\" of 1813 took place on the traditional lands of the Dharug, Gundungurra and Wiradjuri people. Other routes through the ridges and valleys of the Blue Mountains had been used by Aboriginal people for tens of thousands of years. Cox was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset in 1764. He married Rebecca Upjohn at Devizes, Wiltshire in 1789. Cox arrived in NSW on board the \\"Minerva\\" in January 1800. Cox became Chief Magistrate at Windsor in 1810 and in July 1814 Governor Macquarie made William Cox the Superintendent of the works for a new road over the Blue Mountains. His first wife died in 1819 and Cox married Anna Blachford in 1821. He died on 15 March 1837. Cox's road party were in the Woodford area from early to mid- September 1814. The road-building in this area was pragmatic and primitive. Confronted with rocky platforms and sharp drops, Cox had his men clear the flattest parts, removing an \\"immense quantity of rock\\" where necessary, and usually marking out the line with shallow chiselled gutters and utilising the rock platform as a pavement; where the road ran over the shallow soils, it was often marked out by rows or low walls of rough, broken stone. The actual building of the road involved the definition of a trafficable route which was then cleared of vegetation (trees being cut-off below ground level but rarely \\"grubbed out\\"), boulders and rocky outcrops. The formation of the road itself was as minimal as the terrain allowed, with low side-cuttings and embankments as necessary. The actual construction and completion of the road is recorded in Cox's Journal. The journal indicates that three areas in particular required extensive cutting through rocky outcrops; at Linden to Woodford, Wentworth Falls and the descent at Mount York. The Appian Way Precinct is the last of the extant precincts located at Linden and Woodford where the Cox's Road was cut into the rocky ridge in 1814. It was superseded in the 1830s by a new road alignment, below and to the north. In 1831, when Surveyor W. R. Govett drew his \\"Trace of Blue Mountains Road and Range from Springwood to near Pembrokes hut\\" the new line near Twenty Mile Hollow was marked.State Records NSW, Map 5116, Surveyor General R.874 Discoveries of convict-built retaining walls and other features exposed by large-scale highway reconstruction during the 1990s, indicated that extensive work was undertaken in the Woodford area from about 1827 which escalated in the mid-1830s, when a new road line was selected, cut into the mountainside and reinforced by extensive convict-built masonry retaining walls. These were recorded and either relocated; reburied, part-reburied or demolished as the \\"Woodford Bends\\" Reconstruction of the Great Western Highway was completed. A deep railway cutting was made alongside the Appian Way Precinct of Cox's Road it the 1860s, and this was re-used for the Great Western Highway realignment in the 1990s. A second railway cutting was made in 1896 which sheared off the western end of Cox's Road. That cutting was widened for the railway duplication in 1902 and is still in use as part of the Blue Mountains and Main Western Railway Line. The construction of The Appian Way road in 1912 also cut off the eastern end of Cox's Road. Nevertheless, a small section of 1814 road survived, which is now within operational railway land.  Description  William Cox had been instructed by Governor Macquarie only to open a rough cart road, so that the new lands found in the western plains would be symbolically open. The road from Emu Ford to Bathurst, a distance of was completed in only six months. Macquarie's instructions specified that the road should be at least wide in order that two carts would be able to pass each other, and that the timber should be cleared on each side so that the road corridor was wide. Stumps were to be grubbed out and any holes should be filled in. The surviving physical evidence shows relatively few locations where the extant road conforms with the dimensions specified in the instructions. The section of road evident to the west of The Appian Way at Woodford, curves gently, enclosed by two deep cuttings for the railway and highway. Cox's Road is visible as a cleared section of broad and flat sheet stone pavement. A large shelved section of rock has an earthen embankment carrying the road over it. This illustrates the manner in which the other shelved sections may have originally (and subsequently) been made traversable. At the east end, where the Cox's Road commences in this precinct, there is a cutting up to 1 metre high. This has a rough, irregular face, pitted with irregular chisel or pick marks and, here and there the thin () semi-circular shafts, though scattered rather than in parallel formation. An area of similar rock-cutting reappears at the end of the precinct, where it curves but is cut off abruptly by the deep railway cutting to the south. In form this cutting is similar to examples on other Cox's Road precincts at Old Bathurst Road (Woodford) and Cox's Pass (Mount York). As the road proceeds west, the slight embankment is supported by a low and rough rubble retaining wall (Type 1b) of 1‚Äì2 courses and up to high. It runs for approximately 40 metres and has a primitive stone box culvert at its centre ( wide by high) which comprises a single course of stone for the sides, a large roughly hewn stone as a lintel, and an earthen floor. The culvert is now silted up and the side drain which would have fed it is covered.Karskens, 1988, Section 8 'Appian Way Precinct'. It is not known whether Cox's men built culverts on the 1814-15 road. While the adjoining retaining wall matches other early sections in style, there are no other examples of stone culverts in the Cox's Road precincts on the mountains and two similar examples located on the Mount Blaxland precinct date from a later period. It is therefore possible that the culvert, and perhaps the retaining wall were part of post-1814 improvements and widening operations. The road is approximately wide at the widest point. At the edge of the sheet stone pavement there are examples of rock-cut drainage lines. Given the extensive time and labour needed for these, they may also relate to road improvements after the original 1814 road or be related to later railway works. The remains of a small rectangular stone structure (approx. by ) are located south of the road's edge. In 1988, Karskens noted that this resembled the station/stockade/hut remains found on the Great North Road, dating from the 1820s. Karskens also reported that an early hand-wrought iron tool, possibly the end of a pointed chisel or pick-axe was found on the surface of this mound, \\"strongly suggesting that it was connected with the early road works - perhaps a storage depot\\".Karskens,1988, Section 8 'Appian Way Precinct, p 75 There is also a series of other mounds of earth and stones approximately 2 metres in diameter closer to the edge of the road - these are possibly spoil heaps, either from early efforts to fill the rock-shelves or from later railway era works. The presence of the stone structure and other features gives this precinct of Cox's Road particular archaeological research potential. The proposed State Heritage Register listing of Cox's Road and Early Deviations includes six precincts of Cox's Road: *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Linden, Linden Precinct - HC Plan 2639 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Woodford, Old Bathurst Road Precinct - HC Plan 2640 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Woodford, Appian Way Precinct - HC Plan 2641 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Mount York, Cox's Pass Precinct - HC Plan 2642 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Hartley, Clarence Hilly Range / Mount Blaxland Precinct - HC Plan 2643 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Sodwalls, Fish River Descent Precinct - HC Plan 2644 = Condition = As at 1 December 2014, the road was substantially intact. Numerous archaeological features from the 1814 road are evident including road fabric, such as sheet rock pavement, a low wall and small culvert, rock cuttings and rock cut drains. There is also physical evidence of a small rectangular stone structure to the south of the road formation.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries show the route of the road As at 10 November 2014, the surviving remnants of Cox's Road, built 1814 to 1815, have state significance as the earliest road across the Blue Mountains and the first structure built by Europeans west of the Blue Mountains. Building of this road followed from the prior exploration by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth, and the survey by George Evans. The successful construction of the road was symbolic of the conquest of the natural barrier created by the Blue Mountains, and represented Governor Macquarie's vision for the ongoing development of the colony beyond Sydney and its immediate surrounds. Cox's Road enabled the later opening of the hinterland beyond the Blue Mountains for subsequent settlement, pastoral and agricultural expansion, which then escalated the dispossession of Aboriginal peoples from their lands. William Cox was well known among convicts for his power to recommend pardons and tickets of leave. Most of the convicts who volunteered for the work to open a track to the interior were emancipated, receiving Pardons or Tickets of Leave on completion of the work. The surviving road fabric demonstrates the crude and hurried nature of Cox's work, and the techniques used in tracing, cutting and forming the road. In conjunction with later colonial road alignments on the mountains and elsewhere, Cox's Road also forms part of a suite of roads demonstrating the wide range of road building styles and standards employed during the colonial period. Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Woodford, Appian Way Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 March 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state historical significance as physical evidence of the first road constructed across the Blue Mountains from Emu Plains to the Bathurst Plains (1814-15). Constructed in 1814-15 Cox's Road is one of the earliest Colonial- era road-lines surviving in Australia. The 1814 road is tangible evidence of the development of the colony at Sydney and of the expansion of white settlement into western NSW. The road symbolises the occupation of the country and Governor Macquarie's aspirations for the eventual opening of the interior to European settlement after the discovery of the Western plains by G W Evans in 1814. In this respect the 1814-1815 Cox's Road has considerable symbolic significance as an official public work which laid the foundations for future development. Cox's Road is linked with the foundation of Bathurst, the first inland settlement in NSW, which was proclaimed by Governor Macquarie on 7 May 1815 after his journey along the road. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state significance for their close association with Governor Lachlan Macquarie who commissioned the building of the road into the interior, and with the magistrate and ex-army officer Captain William Cox, who supervised the building of the road. The road is also associated with the convicts who laboured on the road to obtain their liberty, and with the officers and men who assisted Cox such as Thomas Hobby, Richard Lewis, John Tighe and Samuel Ayres. The crossing of the Blue Mountains, the surveying of a route to Bathurst and the building of Cox's Road were significant events in the period of Macquarie's governorship. Governor Macquarie's view of the importance of the road is demonstrated by his reports to Earl Bathurst, the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, and by his journey to the Bathurst Plains immediately after its construction, where he proclaimed the site for the Bathurst township. William Cox's achievement using a small group of convict men in a short period of time and with no loss of life caused by road-making or other substantial difficulties, was reflective of his reputation as a more humane employer and magistrate than many of his contemporaries. The leadership qualities, vision and skill he showed constructing the road would also be evident in later government contracts won by Cox for other public works. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The surviving precincts of Cox's Road have state technical significance for their ability to demonstrate simple, pre 1820s road building techniques. Improvement of the 1814 route throughout the 1820s also provide important evidence of later road building techniques and demonstrates the ongoing use of this key route to the interior, before it was superseded by the new Great Western Road laid out by Sir Thomas Mitchell in the 1830s. The Appian Way Precinct of Cox's Road provides an excellent and self-contained example of the type of work done on the stoney Woodford ridge. This precinct neatly encapsulates several key features of early road building, including cuttings, sheet stone pavements, low rock walling, and a very small and primitive culvert. The structural remains and mounds have considerable archaeological potential. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cox's Road and its remnants are demonstrated as having social significance at a state level by the substantial interest in identifying and promoting Cox's Road for cultural tourism and education, and celebrating the bicentenary of the road by the general public, state and local government bodies and a range of community organisations. The road is of particular importance to Cox descendants. The William Cox Fellowship first nominated sections of Cox's Road for heritage listing in the 1980s. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Precincts of Cox's Road have research significance at a state level for their ability to demonstrate early nineteenth century road, culvert and bridge building techniques using basic skills and technologies. The remains of the 1814-15 road illustrate the conditions of the period and contribute to an understanding of the process of exploration and development, and of early colonial road building and road use. The remains represent a major physical, technological and engineering achievement and exhibit fine details of workmanship. Several precincts of the 1814-15 road have specific archaeological potential. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Surviving precincts of the 1814-1815 Cox's Road from Penrith to Bathurst are rare examples of early Colonial road building in NSW. The surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state significance as a rare example of pre 1820 road building based on the use of manual and primitive tools, and predating the more sophisticated road survey and construction techniques employed on the later \\"Great Roads\\" of the 1820s and 1830s.

Ninety-nine of the rooms are believed still to be in existence; the majority (68) are on display at the Art Institute of Chicago, while 20 are at the Phoenix Art Museum, nine at the Knoxville Museum of Art, and one each at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis and the Kaye Miniature Museum in Los Angeles. The Art Institute's rooms document European and American interiors from the late 13th century to the 1930s and the 17th century to the 1930s, respectively. Constructed on a 1:12 scale, the rooms are largely made of the same materials as full-sized rooms, and some even include original works of art.  Background  The model rooms were the brainchild of Narcissa Niblack Thorne, who was born in 1882 in Vincennes, Indiana. During her childhood, her uncle Albert Parker Niblack, a United States Navy vice admiral, sent her many antique dollhouse miniatures from around the world. The idea for the model rooms also developed from Thorne's collection of miniature furniture and household accessories, which she began assembling around 1900, and her desire to house and display these items. A further inspiration may have been a miniature shadow box that she encountered at a bazaar in Istanbul during the 1920s. When she was 19, Thorne married Montgomery Ward department store heir James Ward Thorne, whose fortune would help finance her hobby. They lived together in Lake Forest, Illinois. By 1930, Thorne was researching period architecture, interior design, and decorative arts to create sketches and blueprints for miniature rooms to house her dollhouse miniatures and other miniature furniture.  Description  Chandelier detail, Thorne miniature rooms at the Art Institute of Chicago During the Great Depression, Thorne had access to some of the top architects, interior designers, and craftsmen in the United States, who between 1932 and 1940 created approximately 100 \\"period rooms\\" under her direction. In total, 99 of the rooms are believed still to be in existence. The original 30 were placed on display at the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, and in 1940 they were the subject of a LIFE magazine article. Twenty of these original rooms were donated to the Phoenix Art Museum, where they remain on display. The majority of the rooms, 68 in all, are on display at the Art Institute of Chicago, where they document European and American interiors from the late 13th century to the 1930s and the 17th century to the 1930s, respectively. The Art Institute's rooms were created by Thorne and her craftsmen between 1932 and 1940 at her studio on Oak Street on the city's Near North Side; the 31 European rooms were finished by 1937, while the 37 American rooms were completed by 1940. The rooms were gifted to the museum in 1941, and put on permanent display in 1954. The Art Institute of Chicago's rooms are among the museum's most popular permanent collections. The Knoxville Museum of Art is home to 9 of the remaining rooms, while The Children's Museum of Indianapolis and the Kaye Miniature Museum in Los Angeles have one each. Some of the Thorne rooms are miniature replicas of actual rooms. They were constructed on a 1:12 scale, or in other words a scale of to . The rooms are largely made of the same materials as full-sized rooms; for example, they include bowls made of silver, chandeliers made of crystal, and even original works of art, both miniature paintings (by Fernand L√©ger, Hildreth Mei√®re, Am√©d√©e Ozenfant, and L√©opold Survage) and sculptures (by John Storrs). In 2010, the Art Institute of Chicago began decorating a few of its rooms for Christmas, Hanukkah, and New Year's, using period-appropriate decorations for each of the involved rooms. Lindsey Mican Morgan, who is responsible for the rooms at the Art Institute, began the practice of decorating the rooms for the holidays after discovering Thorne's great affection for Christmas while researching.

It was designed and built by William Cox from 1814, with the assistance of a convict road party.. It is also known as Old Bathurst Road and Coxs Road. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 31 July 2015.  History  The road from Emu Ford to Bathurst, a distance of was completed in only six months during 1814 and 1815 by a working party composed mostly of convicts. Governor Lachlan Macquarie decided to have a carriage road constructed across the Blue Mountains, to the country which had been \\"newly discovered\\" by Europeans in 1813. The so called \\"First Crossing\\" of 1813 took place on the traditional lands of the Dharug, Gundungurra and Wiradjuri people. Other routes through the ridges and valleys of the Blue Mountains had been used by Aboriginal people for tens of thousands of years. Cox was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset in 1764. He married Rebecca Upjohn at Devizes, Wiltshire in 1789. Cox arrived in NSW on board the \\"Minerva\\" in January 1800. Cox became Chief Magistrate at Windsor in 1810 and in July 1814 Governor Macquarie made William Cox the Superintendent of the works for a new road over the Blue Mountains. His first wife died in 1819 and Cox married Anna Blachford in 1821. He died on 15 March 1837. Cox's road party reached the Linden area by late August 1814, and remained at Linden - Woodford until around mid-September 1814, by which time they had moved on to the present day vicinity of Hazelbrook. It was the first time they encountered the steep rocky platforms, and the ever-narrowing ridge. Cox's style of road-building was pragmatic and primitive. Confronted with rocky platforms and sharp drops, he generally had his men clear the flattest parts, removing an \\"immense quantity of rock\\" where necessary, and usually marking out the line with shallow chiselled gutters and utilising the rock platform as a pavement; where the road ran over the shallow soils, it was often marked out by rows or low walls of rough, broken stone. The road was cut past 'Caley's' cairn of stones, built, it was thought, to mark the end of an earlier unsuccessful attempt to cross the mountains, but possibly a structure of Aboriginal origin.S Lavelle, 'Caley's Repulse: Explorations in Desire' pp 174 - 185 in Fresh Cuts: New Talents 2001, Journal of Australian Studies No. 67, University of Queensland Press, St Lucia, QLD, 2001 The actual construction and completion of the road is recorded in Cox's Journal. The journal indicates that three areas in particular required extensive cutting through rocky outcrops, an activity especially likely to have left an \\"archaeological imprint\\" in the form of surviving physical evidence. These areas were Linden to Woodford, Wentworth Falls and the descent at Mount York. Entries in the journal indicate that the road party reached the Linden area at the end of August and constructed the road through the localities of Linden and Woodford during the first half of September, 1814.Cox's Journal 28 August to 13 September 1814 Cox wrote describing the Linden - Woodford area as follows:Cox's journal, C708-2, Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales, digitised at: http://www.acmssearch.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/itemDetailPaged.cgi?itemID=457616\\"Memoirs of William Cox, JP\\", William Brooks and Co, 1901A H C Whitaker, William Cox and Cox's Road: A Bicentenary Souvenir, 2014: Chapter 4. The actual building of the road involved the definition of a trafficable route which was then cleared of vegetation (trees being cut-off below ground level but rarely \\"grubbed out\\"), boulders and rocky outcrops. The formation of the road itself was as minimal as the terrain allowed, with low side-cuttings and embankments as necessary. In very rocky terrain cuttings were made into the mountain itself, the natural rock providing the road surface or pavement. It is possible that some of the stepped rock platforms may have initially been partly filled or levelled with earthen ramps, although Karskens (1988) suggests that Cox mostly left the road pavement in an unformed, natural state due to the haste with which the road was being constructed. Even if it was initially partly filled or shaped, much of the original surface of the road weathered away quickly, as by 1819 it was reported that the stumps of the trees which had been left within the roadway were becoming exposed. Well preserved sections and other scattered remnants of Cox's Road survive in the Linden and Woodford areas. These include isolated remnants such as single gutters and wedge-pits in the vicinity of the Linden Railway Station and near the Linden Reservoir (above Numantia Road). Neither of these sections is within this SHR Listing. There is also a well preserved section of Cox's Road which commences immediately west of the Hepburn Road and Great Western Highway intersection and continues west along Old Bathurst Road at Woodford. Although the original line of Cox's Road crossed Tollgate Drive, the railway line and the Great Western Highway beyond the western end of the unsurfaced track at Railway Parade, Linden, construction activity has been intensive and no remnants of the road exist in this location. From the 1820s onwards, the earlier lines of road were upgraded and although short sections of Cox's Road were later adopted as parts of the local road network (eg. part of Burke Road, Linden and Old Bathurst Road, Woodford) most of the original Cox's Road appears to have gradually gone out of use in the Linden area during the 1830s  Description  William Cox had been instructed by Governor Macquarie only to open a rough cart road, so that the new lands found in the western plains would be symbolically open. The road from Emu Ford to Bathurst, a distance of was completed in only six months. Macquarie's instructions specified that the road should be at least wide in order that two carts would be able to pass each other, and that the timber should be cleared on each side so that the road corridor was wide. Stumps were to be grubbed out and any holes should be filled in. This was the method adopted in relatively easy terrain, although later travellers reported that the stumps had not always been removed and the surviving physical evidence shows relatively few locations where the extant road conforms with the dimensions specified in the instructions. The Tollgate Drive section of Cox's Road is the first of the more intact surviving sections of the 1814 road which are encountered within the Blue Mountains LGA. The 1814 road occupies the crest of the ridge. It extends for over beside and overlapping with an unsurfaced access road along the top of the ridge and also partly within adjoining private properties. The modern roughly formed vehicular access track with some subsidiary diversions, leads off Tollgate Drive/Railway Parade. The modern unsurfaced tracks themselves cross, and in some places partly overlie, the earlier Cox's Road formation. The western end of the access track commences at Railway Parade where it climbs a short steep rise surfaced with loose stones. Where there are rocky outcrops beside the road it features several sections of low hand-cut gutters and kerb-lines (). The cuttings are between in height and where they mark both sides of the road they are apart, roughly conforming with Governor Macquarie's requested width of \\"\\". Most of the cuttings have vertical faces and feature sharp pointed marks indicating the use of chisels or pick-axes during construction. Other marks suggest the use of a long round iron spike which makes marks in diameter and long. A small section of rock-cut drain measuring wide and long is also evident. In several places the low kerb cuttings adjoin sections of rock platform. These have generally been cut and smoothed at the edge of the road but in the centre remain very uneven, with natural cracks and crevices and evidence of deeply scored ruts made by the wheels of carts or other vehicles. From the ridge there are extensive views on both sides of the road which conform with those described by early travellers, giving a sense of the experience of the early 19th century road even though the surrounding area has been recently subdivided and developed for residential house blocks.

From the ridge there are extensive views on both sides of the road which conform with those described by early travellers, giving a sense of the experience of the early nineteenth-century road even though the surrounding area has been recently subdivided and developed for residential house blocks. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cox's Road and its remnants are demonstrated as having social significance at a state level by the substantial interest in identifying and promoting Cox's Road for cultural tourism and education, and celebrating the bicentenary of the road by the general public, state and local government bodies and a range of community organisations. The road is of particular importance to Cox descendants. The William Cox Fellowship first nominated sections of Cox's Road for heritage listing in the 1980s. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Precincts of Cox's Road have research significance at a state level for their ability to demonstrate early nineteenth century road, culvert and bridge building techniques using basic skills and technologies. The remains of the 1814-15 road illustrate the conditions of the period and contribute to an understanding of the process of exploration and development, and of early colonial road building and road use. The remains represent a major physical, technological and engineering achievement and exhibit fine details of workmanship. Several precincts of the 1814-15 road have specific archaeological potential. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Surviving precincts of the 1814-1815 Cox's Road from Penrith to Bathurst are rare examples of early Colonial road building in NSW. The surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state significance as a rare example of pre 1820 road building based on the use of manual and primitive tools, and predating the more sophisticated road survey and construction techniques employed on the later \\"Great Roads\\" of the 1820s and 1830s.

She is a University Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of Kansas. Biernat received the APA Distinguished Scientific Award for Early Career Contribution to Psychology in the area of Social Psychology in 1998/1999. The award citation emphasized her \\"outstanding, incisive research illuminating the linkage between social judgments and the perceiver‚Äôs subjective frame of reference.\\" and \\"wide-ranging studies show[ing] how the judgments elicited by different target-individuals are partly determined by the target‚Äôs membership in an identifiable social group.\\" Biernat and her colleagues were awarded the Association for Women in Psychology Distinguished Publication Award in 2005 for their work on the volume The Maternal Wall: Research and Policy Perspectives Against Mothers. With her husband Chris Crandall, Biernat was honored for Distinguished Service to the Society for Personality and Social Psychology (SPSP) in 2012. Biernat and Crandall co-edited the Society's newsletter; Biernat also served as SPSP's Council Representative (2001-2003), Member and Chair of the Convention Committee (2007-2009), and Secretary- Treasurer of the Organization (2010-2012). Biernat is the author of the monograph Standards and Expectancies: Contrast and Assimilation in Judgments of Self and Others, and co-editor of the 2008 volume Commemorating Brown: The Social Psychology of Racism and Discrimination.  Biography  Biernat was born in 1963 and grew up in a Polish-Catholic neighborhood in Detroit, MI. She completed an A.B. degree in Psychology and Communication at University of Michigan in 1984. She continued her education at University of Michigan where she earned an M.A. in 1986 and Ph.D in Psychology (Social) in 1989, under the supervision of Melvin Manis. Her dissertation, titled Developing patterns of social judgment: Reliance on gender stereotypes vs. individuating information, tested participants ranging in age from kindergarten children to college students and found stability in their use of gender labels to make judgments about individuals. Biernat was an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of Florida (1989-1992) prior to joining the faculty of the University of Kansas in 1992. Her research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Mental Health, and the United States Department of Justice. Biernat was a Docking Faculty Scholar of the University of Kansas from 1999-2003. She was awarded the W. T. Kemper Fellowship for Teaching Excellence at University of Kansas in 2004. She received the Louise Byrd Graduate Educator Award from the University of Kansas in 2018, and was named the 2018 Mentor of the Year for her involvement with the McNair Scholars Program.  Research  Biernat is perhaps best known for her work on social stereotypes. She received the Phillip Brickman Memorial Prize (1987) for an earlier version of the paper Stereotypes on campus: How contact and liking influence perceptions of group distinctiveness. This paper explored the contact hypothesis ‚Äì that interactions with members of a stereotyped group may lead to increase liking of the group, subsequently decreasing the strength of the stereotype. Biernat is well known for her research on social stereotypes, and the widely cited model of shifting standards, which proposed that people tend to use category-specific standards to judge members of stereotyped groups. One of her recent studies examined social judgments and prejudice involving race. A student sent an email expressing interest in graduate training to more than 400 White professors: in some emails, the student used a Chinese name, Xian, and in others he used an Americanized name, Alex. More of the professors responded to student's request when email used the name Alex instead of Xian. Such findings suggest that faculty members may use cultural factors in judging graduate school applicants. Biernat's co-authored paper ‚ÄúComing out‚Äù among gay Latino and gay White men: implications of verbal disclosure for well-being,\\" published in the journal Self and Identity, was named ‚Äúbest paper of the year‚Äù in 2016 by the International Society for Self and Identity (ISSI). This paper examined different rates of disclosure about sexual orientation among gay Latino and White men in relation to subjective well being.

The so called \\"First Crossing\\" of 1813 took place on the traditional lands of the Dharug, Gundungurra and Wiradjuri people. Other routes through the ridges and valleys of the Blue Mountains had been used by Aboriginal people for tens of thousands of years. Cox was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset in 1764. He married Rebecca Upjohn at Devizes, Wiltshire in 1789. Cox arrived in NSW on board the \\"Minerva\\" in January 1800. Cox became Chief Magistrate at Windsor in 1810 and in July 1814 Governor Macquarie made William Cox the Superintendent of the works for a new road over the Blue Mountains. His first wife died in 1819 and Cox married Anna Blachford in 1821. He died on 15 March 1837. Mount York is found at the end of a spur which projects westward from the main Blue Mountains ridge, on the edge of the western escarpment. It has a spectacular view westwards over the Hartley Valley, Kanimbla Valley and the Vale of Clywdd. The view from Mount York became a symbolic focus as a vista of the western lands revealed after the struggle and triumph of the First Crossing..S. Lavelle, 1813 A Tale that Grew in the Telling, Chapter 5 \\"Mount York: The Right Connotations and a Great View\\", WriteLight Pty Ltd, 2013 The construction of a descent from the bluff at Mount York took William Cox and his road party five weeks between 7 November and 14 December 1814. The actual building of the road involved the definition of a trafficable route which was then cleared of vegetation (trees being cut-off below ground level but rarely \\"grubbed out\\"), boulders and rocky outcrops. The formation of the road itself was as minimal as the terrain allowed, with low side-cuttings and embankments as necessary. The actual construction and completion of the road is recorded in Cox's Journal. Cox's journal indicates that three areas in particular required extensive cutting through rocky outcrops; at Linden to Woodford, Wentworth Falls and the descent at Mount York. In early November 1814 Cox sent several different parties to examine the mountain \\"at the end of the ridge\\" and the adjacent ridges and gullies to seek the best line for the building of a road descent to the valley below. He described the route as \\"going down steep between immense large boulders\\" and \\"bounded both by steep gullies and rocks\\" and noted \\"it is with much difficulty a person can get down at all\\". He doubted it was possible to \\"make a good road to go down and up again\\" without great cost in labour, time and materials and therefore settled on making a basic road suitable for a light and unloaded cart, or for the driving of stock down the \\"Herculean mountain\\". The present Mount York Road adopts a similar line to Cox's Road along the top of the ridge with minor deviations from the original route. Two signposted \\"Historic Wells\\" along this route about 500 metres south of Barden's Lookout, are unlikely to be original works associated with the 1814 road. Cox's Journal makes no reference to well-digging even though the road party was in this area for several weeks, but he does refer to water being transported in kegs \\"from the rocks below\\". Cox referred in his Journal to \\"hard ground\\" full of \\"very large rocks\\" and he commented frequently on the amount of time, labour and gunpowder needed to complete the pass down the mountain with large rocks cut and \\"turned out\\" of the road line or blasted away. Examples of the Journal entries are as follows:Cox's journal, C708-2, Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales, digitised at: http://www.acmssearch.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/itemDetailPaged.cgi?itemID=457616\\"Memoirs of William Cox, JP\\", William Brooks and Co, 1901A H C Whitaker, William Cox and Cox's Road: A Bicentenary Souvenir, 2014: Chapter 4. This extensive work over a five-week period in late 1814 has left substantial physical remnants of old Cox's Road visible in this area, including cuttings, gutters, retaining walls, fence sockets, and two bridge sites. These obvious remnants made this section of Cox's Road one of the best known and most celebrated in the past. Cox's Pass and Cox's River were both specifically named by Governor Macquarie in 1815. The Government and General Order of 10 June 1815, gave lavish praise to William Cox: Governor Macquarie's own Journal of his 1815 Tour along the road also noted: With this description of Mount York and Cox's Pass, Governor Macquarie used the kind of extravagant rhetoric which subsequently found favour with others who wrote about the history of the Western Road, wanting to invest it with symbolic meaning. Cox's Road was quickly modified and then superseded by alternative road descents from the Mount York ridge, initially Lawson's Long Alley in 1823/24, and then Lockyer's Road in 1829. The entire ridge was bypassed with the transfer of convicts to work on Mitchell's Pass and the Great Western Road during the 1830s.S. Lavelle, 2013:133 The spectacular views over the Hartley Valley from the famous vantage point of Mount York and the presence of historic relics of the Cox's Road (also described as the old Bathurst Road) contributed to its selection as the major site for commemoration during the 1913 Centenary Celebrations for the \\"First Crossing\\" of the Blue Mountains. The speeches and publications prepared at that time used elaborate rhetoric about explorers, visionary Governors, road- builders and pioneers. The Mount York reserve was again the setting for the major civic event held in May 2013 as part of Bicentennial Commemorations of the Crossings of the Blue Mountains. The Pass at Mount York remains one of the most intact and most significant surviving sections of the 1814-1815 Cox's Road, and it is accessible as a walking track from the public reserve at the end of Mount York Road.  Description  William Cox had been instructed by Governor Macquarie only to open a rough cart road, so that the new lands found in the western plains would be symbolically open. The road from Emu Ford to Bathurst, a distance of was completed in only six months. Macquarie's instructions specified that the road should be at least wide in order that two carts would be able to pass each other, and that the timber should be cleared on each side so that the road corridor was wide. Stumps were to be grubbed out and any holes should be filled in. The surviving physical evidence shows relatively few locations where the extant road conforms with the dimensions specified in the instructions. A signposted walking track commences from the public reserve at the end of Mount York Road. Near the summit, intermittent low cuttings are evident, with much later steps cut or built into the line of the actual road. (loc: -33.552892,150.220082). There is also a section of low stone wall running beside the track for about , giving the road formation a width of about . The physical evidence at the top of the pass is heavily overlaid by much more recent activity related to construction of the modern walking track and other erosion control and bush regeneration activities. Much modern work including low rock walling and new sandstone steps confuse and obscure the original nature of Cox's Road. About from the summit the road divides, the early road continuing on the north (left) side and another early 1820s deviation to avoid the rocky outcrops to the south (right). The two descents rejoin after about . The 1814 road features a very clear \\"Cox gutter\\" which curves down the hill. The gutter is up to high and is identified with an inset metal plaque. Slightly lower down the hill on a boulder to the left of the road, are three distinct rectangular sockets cut into the rock. Another plaque identifies these as likely to be sockets to take the rails for a timber fence. (loc -33.553019,150.222457). A timber-railed fence is shown in several of the early views of Cox's Pass, including three by J. W. Lewin in 1815 (showing two rails) and another by Pellion in 1819 (showing three rails). Cox's Journal also refers to the men and the carpenter splitting posts and rails \\"for fencing the road down the mountain\\". Close to the fence sockets, the same large boulder features a large area of rock cutting. This bears a plaque which states that the pick marks evident were made to allow Governor Macquarie's coach to pass along the route in 1815. This appears to be a fanciful interpretation made by the early reserve trustees as none of the journals for the Macquarie expedition mention such an event which would be expected to have delayed the journey for some time. The 1814 road continues through a series of large rock outcrops, several with deep overhangs (loc: -33.553734,150.222437) which are apparently those Cox described as so \\"lofty and undermined\\" that the men of the road party were able to take shelter in them and \\"sleep dry\\". Dramatic large rock overhangs appear in several early views showing travel down Cox's Pass in the 1820s (possibly based on earlier drawings by Lewin). The distinctively shaped rocks illustrated in these images may still be seen on the Pass today. About below where the two road loops rejoin, the site of Cox's second \\"land bridge\\" is evident. (loc: -33.553548,150.223882). Another metal sign identifies this location. There is a flat stone outcrop which has rock-cut sockets and trenches apart into which timber supports/ beams would have been placed. Cox's Journal also refers to two \\"large trees\\", long respectively, which were \\"fixed as side pieces to the bridge\\". At the southern end of the bridge site there is also a rock-cut drain which would have directed any water run-off from the steep hillside away from the bridge. The bridge would have been finished with slabs as primitive decking fixed to the beams (effectively crude log stringers) the whole probably resting on a fill of earth and large broken stones quarried and \\"turned out\\" of the mountainside. The last work on this bridge was the placement of another tree long and in circumference which was \\"fixed as a side piece below the bridge and joining the rock\\". Cox records that the stonemason also completed some rock-work below the bridge. This is evident as a low rock retaining wall supporting the road below the bridge where there is a cutting on the upper side but the width of the road formation decreases from wide. The road continues to descend to the base of the hill in a northerly direction and on a steep gradient with a cut and fill formation, the fill comprising earth and remnants of possible stone rubble pavement. There are some areas of retaining wall and also of picked or chiselled cuttings, some of which are up to high. One cutting bears the distinct letters WRP. It has been suggested that this inscription stands for \\"Western Road Party\\". It is unclear whether this inscription was related to the actual 1814 road party or to a slightly later phase, although its roman serif lettering is very similar in style to other inscriptions found on Colonial-era roads. The road turns east to follow the natural contours of the topography and at the base of the hill the road line commences a series of zig-zag turns. It is in this vicinity, from the first curve to the base of the zig-zag turn, that the Lewin paintings showing the descent of Cox's Pass are likely to have been sketched. Upon reaching the valley floor the old road line diverges from the modern walking track. The modern track continues north to meet the line of Lockyer's Road, whilst Cox's Road turned to the northwest where it enters private property. The walking track continues past the Lockyer's Road track junction to emerge in a picnic area beside the Hartley Vale Road. Within the private property Lot 102 DP 751644 there are two sections of early road formation present within an area of grassed paddock. A section of early road is cut into a small rise with a part rock and part earth- faced cutting and a crude, low rubble stone retaining wall. This section extends for approximately and is between wide, that is approximating the \\"\\" width given in the instructions for the 1814 road. A number of mature trees have now grown within parts of the old road formation. From the top of the small rise the 1814 road would have turned to the west to skirt around the base of Mount York. Due to the swampy nature of the ground in parts of this area it is unlikely that any clear evidence of the 1814 road survives until the line re-joins the present-day Fields Road/Mid Hartley Road. By the time that the road was re-surveyed by James McBrien in 1823, Cox' s Road had been deviated away from the problematic, wet and swampy ground. The 1823 survey shows the road heading further north and forming a much larger curve away from the base of Mount York.J. McBrien, 1823, Field Book No. 205, p. 44, State Records NSW Evidence of a slightly later road line also exists within private property. This comprises another earth formation benched into a hillside with another low stone retaining wall which is present about northeast of the 1814 road. Whilst the earlier road has mostly unworked field stones, the walling of the later road includes better prepared, roughly hammered, squared and shaped blocks which form up to three courses of walling, sometimes only placed as stack-bonding. This walling has characteristics typical of early 1820s work. Up to of road is clearly evident, which turns northwest to follow the contour around a small hill, before heading further north into adjacent private property. The State Heritage Register listing of Cox's Road and Early Deviations includes six precincts of Cox's Road: *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Linden, Linden Precinct - HC Plan 2639 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Woodford, Old Bathurst Road Precinct - HC Plan 2640 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Woodford, Appian Way Precinct - HC Plan 2641 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Mount York , Cox's Pass Precinct - HC Plan 2642 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Hartley, Clarence Hilly Range / Mount Blaxland Precinct - HC Plan 2643 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Sodwalls, Fish River Descent Precinct - HC Plan 2644 = Condition = As at 1 December 2014, the road is substantially intact. Numerous archaeological features from the 1814 road are evident including road fabric, gutters, cuttings, rock-cut drains, bridge sites and inscriptions. = Further information = During 2013 extensive work was undertaken in the Mount York Reserve to refurbish existing monuments and install interpretative signage. That work included a sign specifically related to Cox's Road.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries show the route of the road As at 10 February 2015, the surviving remnants of Cox's Road, built 1814 to 1815, have state significance as the earliest road across the Blue Mountains and the first structure built by Europeans west of the Blue Mountains. Building of this road followed from the prior exploration by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth, and the survey by George Evans. The successful construction of the road was symbolic of the conquest of the natural barrier created by the Blue Mountains, and represented Governor Macquarie's vision for the ongoing development of the colony beyond Sydney and its immediate surrounds. Cox's Road enabled the later opening of the hinterland beyond the Blue Mountains for subsequent settlement, pastoral and agricultural expansion, which then escalated the dispossession of Aboriginal peoples from their lands. William Cox was well known among convicts for his power to recommend pardons and tickets of leave. Most of the convicts who volunteered for the work to open a track to the interior were emancipated, receiving Pardons or Tickets of Leave on completion of the work. The surviving road fabric demonstrates the crude and hurried nature of Cox's work, and the techniques used in tracing, cutting and forming the road. In conjunction with later colonial road alignments on the mountains and elsewhere, Cox's Road also forms part of a suite of roads demonstrating the wide range of road building styles and standards employed during the colonial period. Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Mount York, Cox's Pass Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 March 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state historical significance as physical evidence of the first road constructed across the Blue Mountains from Emu Plains to the Bathurst Plains (1814-15). Constructed in 1814-15 Cox's Road is one of the earliest Colonial-era road- lines surviving in Australia. The 1814 road is tangible evidence of the development of the colony at Sydney and of the expansion of white settlement into western NSW. The road symbolises the occupation of the country and Governor Macquarie's aspirations for the eventual opening of the interior to European settlement after the discovery of the Western plains by G W Evans in 1814. In this respect the 1814-1815 Cox's Road has considerable symbolic significance as an official public work which laid the foundations for future development. Cox's Road is linked with the foundation of Bathurst, the first inland settlement in NSW, which was proclaimed by Governor Macquarie on 7 May 1815 after his journey along the road. Historically, Cox's Pass at Mount York became heavily imbued with symbolic cultural meaning commencing with the lavish praise given by Governor Macquarie in 1815 and then through the series of traveller's accounts and artworks which featured the Pass in subsequent years. This was further exemplified in the extravagant rhetoric about explorers, visionary Governors, road-builders and pioneers during the \\"First Crossing\\" Centenary Celebrations held at Mount York in 1913 which was partially repeated in recent Bicentennial commemorations in May 2013. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state significance for their close association with Governor Lachlan Macquarie who commissioned the building of the road into the interior, and with the magistrate and ex-army officer Captain William Cox, who supervised the building of the road. The road is also associated with the convicts who laboured on the road to obtain their liberty, and with the officers and men who assisted Cox such as Thomas Hobby, Richard Lewis, John Tighe and Samuel Ayres. The crossing of the Blue Mountains, the surveying of a route to Bathurst and the building of Cox's Road were significant events in the period of Macquarie's governorship. Governor Macquarie's view of the importance of the road is demonstrated by his reports to Earl Bathurst, the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, and by his journey to the Bathurst Plains immediately after its construction, where he proclaimed the site for the Bathurst township. William Cox's achievement using a small group of convict men in a short period of time and with no loss of life caused by road-making or other substantial difficulties, was reflective of his reputation as a more humane employer and magistrate than many of his contemporaries. The leadership qualities, vision and skill he showed constructing the road would also be evident in later government contracts won by Cox for other public works . Cox's Pass at Mount York was specifically named by Governor Macquarie to 'perpetuate the memory of Mr Cox's services' and as \\"a just tribute due to his indefatigable zeal and meritorious exertions\\". The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The surviving precincts of Cox's Road have state technical significance for their ability to demonstrate simple, pre 1820s road building techniques. Improvement of the 1814 route throughout the 1820s also provide important evidence of later road building techniques and demonstrates the ongoing use of this key route to the interior, before it was superseded by the new Great Western Road laid out by Sir Thomas Mitchell in the 1830s. Cox's Pass at Mount York is one of the most significant and intact precincts of Cox' s Road for its ability to demonstrate the methods and approaches adopted, and the results achieved, by William Cox and the convicts of the 1814 road party. Cox's Pass also has primary physical evidence which records and displays later attempts to improve some of the most difficult sections before the 1814 road was superseded by new road lines in the 1820s. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cox's Road and its remnants are demonstrated as having social significance at a state level by the substantial interest in identifying and promoting Cox's Road for cultural tourism and education, and celebrating the bicentenary of the road by the general public, state and local government bodies and a range of community organisations. The road is of particular importance to Cox descendants. The William Cox Fellowship first nominated sections of Cox's Road for heritage listing in the 1980s. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Precincts of Cox's Road have research significance at a state level for their ability to demonstrate early nineteenth century road, culvert and bridge building techniques using basic skills and technologies. The remains of the 1814-15 road illustrate the conditions of the period and contribute to an understanding of the process of exploration and development, and of early colonial road building and road use. The remains represent a major physical, technological and engineering achievement and exhibit fine details of workmanship. Several precincts of the 1814-15 road have specific archaeological potential. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Surviving precincts of the 1814-1815 Cox's Road from Penrith to Bathurst are rare examples of early Colonial road building in NSW. The surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state significance as a rare example of pre 1820 road building based on the use of manual and primitive tools, and predating the more sophisticated road survey and construction techniques employed on the later \\"Great Roads\\" of the 1820s and 1830s.

On their way from the town of Paombong, Bulacan to the mountain ranges of Bulacan, General Isidoro Torres of Malolos decided to divide the troop of Katipuneros into two: one group under his supervision while the other under the guidance of General Enriquez and his brother Colonel Vicente Enriquez. The group of General Enriquez was supposedly heading to the town of Baliuag, Bulacan but decided to stay instead in San Rafael, believing it to be a strategic site. Unknowingly, a Spanish troop from Manila heading towards San Rafael, prepared to silence the Filipino insurgents. The battle started at around 7 a.m. on November 30, 1896. The Spanish forces were so strong that General Enriquez ordered a retreat to the San Rafael. Sometime in the middle of the battle, some of the Filipino troops including Colonel Enriquez were separated from the rest of the group and headed to the town of Bigaa (now Balagtas). At around noon, the Spanish army forced the church doors open and murdered the Filipino revolutionaries seeking shelter in the church. It is estimated that nearly 800 people were killed in the battle, most of whom were children and other locals. The number of casualties was so immense that it was believed that blood spilled in the church reached ankle-deep. The gobernadorcillo of San Rafael ordered a mass grave to be made near the church.

The Fetsund Booms () are a Norwegian national cultural heritage monument, log driving museum, and wetland center at the outlet of the Glomma River into Lake √òyeren in Fetsund in Viken county. The Fetsund Booms were set up as a timber sorting facility in 1861 and operated until 1985, when log driving came to an end on the Glomma River. Today the facility is part of the Akershus Museum. The millennium site for the municipality of Fetsund is located next to the Vinkelen building at the facility. It is a flood marker in the form of a stone about high with markings to record the highest flood levels on the Glomma River. History Log driving on the Glomma River began in the 1300s, but increased when frame saws were introduced in the 16th century. In the beginning, the timber was tied together in the Glomma River at the Bingen Booms at S√∏rumsand. From there, the timber rafts were towed by boats to the many sawmills along the lake and in Lillestr√∏m. When the railway bridge in Fetsund was built in 1861, the booms at Bingen were moved to Fetsund. At Bingen, catch booms were set up that could release timber as needed at Fetsund. Today the Fetsund Booms are protected as Norway's only remaining log-driving facility. The Fetsund Booms are also believed to be the only preserved log-driving facility of their kind in the world. They are preserved as outstanding cultural heritage and a living museum with workshops for traditional crafts, cafes, and museum shops. The Fetsund Booms are located in an attractive natural area at the entrance to northern Europe's largest inland delta. There is also a nature trail with cultural highlights in the area.

He is also an honorary head of ARCADIA, a specialised nutraceutical and lifestyle medicine research group in Melbourne, Australia, and an honorary Principal Research Fellow at the University of Melbourne, Department of Psychiatry. Sarris' principal research interests pertain to the use of nutraceutical and lifestyle medicine in anxiety and mood disorders, psychotropic plant medicines (such as kava) in psychiatry, as well as the use of pharmacogenetics to guide psychiatric treatment. Early life Jerome Sarris was born in Sydney, Australia. He was raised on the North Shore of Sydney and attended Mosman Preparatory School. After moving to Brisbane at age 9, Sarris attended Ironside State School, then Brisbane Boys College. At age 17, Sarris lived in Glastonbury, England, for several years before returning to Brisbane to pursue further study. Sarris' heritage is primarily Austrian, German and French, and he has a great grandmother from the Polynesian Gilbertese Islands. Academic career Sarris has completed advanced diplomas and degrees in western herbal medicine, naturopathy, acupuncture and nutrition, and has practiced clinically in these areas. During this period of clinical practice, Sarris obtained a master's degree majoring in plant-based medicine under Kerry Bone at the University of New England, Australia. Sarris then completed a doctorate in the field of psychiatry at the University of Queensland under the mentorship of Professors David Kavanagh and Gerard Byrne. After receiving a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Early Career Fellowship he undertook his postdoctoral training at the University of Melbourne, under the mentorship of Isaac Schweitzer. His post-doctoral studies were also based at The Centre of Human Psychopharmacology at Swinburne University of Technology with Con Stough and Andrew Scholey, as well as The Depression Clinical Research program at Harvard Medical School with David Mischoulon. Sarris is currently an NHMRC Clinical Research Fellow, and leads the Healthy Minds Research Theme at NICM Health Research Institute. Research and scientific contributions Sarris' main research contributions have been in the areas of integrative mental health, nutritional psychiatry and in the development of evidence-based practice in naturopathy. He has co-authored a textbook, and published many highly cited papers in these fields. His work has impacted treatment guidelines for mood and anxiety disorders. Sarris has advocated for a more integrated model of treatment of depression, involving an evidence-based application of select nutraceuticals and lifestyle modification, alongside mainstream judicious use of pharmacotherapies and psychological techniques. Sarris has been a prominent figure in the investigation of South Pacific psychotropic medicinal plant kava (Piper methysticum), playing an assistance role in the direction of kava policy at the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. He has conducted several RCTs (as well as one currently ongoing) in anxiety and mood disorder involving extracts of this plant. His research on traditional water-extracted noble cultivars of the plant has influenced the safety guidelines around usage and development of such extracts for the treatment of anxiety. Sarris was a co-founder of The International Network of Integrative Mental Health, The International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research (founded by Felice Jacka), and the Australian Medicinal Cannabis Research and Education Collaboration (co-founded with Justin Sinclair). Sarris' is currently undertaking work focusing on developing unique formulations of nutraceutical and psychotropic plant medicines for treating mental disorders, and in the application of lifestyle approaches to enhance mental health.

Early life and family  Amanda Bartlett Harris was born in Warner, New Hampshire, as the second child of attorney Harrison Gray Harris and Mary (Bartlett) Harris. She had an elder brother, John A. Harris, born in 1823; a younger sister, Mary B. Harris, born in 1838; and a younger brother, Henry L. Harris, born in 1840. Only the younger brother, Henry, ever married. She had other siblings, but their names have not been identified. Her father, Harrison, studied law with his brother, Judge John Harris, of Hopkinton, New Hampshire, and was admitted to the bar in 1815. In Warner, he held some public offices and over the years transitioned his pursuits to agriculture. Both Harrison and his eldest son, John A., were influential members in the Masonic Order.  Career  Harris began writing at a young age. However, she put her aspirations on pause when her mother died in 1843 and she was left with the responsibilities of raising her four younger siblings and keeping the house for her father. She still wrote but did not do so for publication or under her own name until her father's death in 1875. However, under the pen names Venetia and Ada Grey in 1844 and 1848, respectively, she achieved some success, publishing in a New Hampshire newspaper under the former and in a publication under the latter. Her work was entitled \\"The Elder Sister\\" and is a story about a young girl whose mother died, presumably an idealized story of her situation raising her younger siblings. She also used the pseudonym \\"Kirkland\\" when writing in the Christian Union. Family records indicate that the first work she published in her own name was entitled \\"The Gypsy Queen\\" in the American Union in 1849, but this particular article has yet to be recovered. However, from 1876 to 1893, she published prolifically, totaling over 150 works and 10 books, mostly for the Lothrop Company in Boston. Her stories were mainly published in Wide Awake, edited by Ella and Charles Pratt, who later became Warner residents themselves. This publication later became known as St. Nicholas Magazine, in which Harris continued to publish works. Her 1880 book How We Went Birds' Nesting included drawings by G.F. Barnes and was \\"elegantly printed.\\" Her book of biographical sketches, Pleasant Authors for Young Folks (1883), was written about in the Detroit Free Press, who said, \\"It is written in a pleasant, instructive vein, for young readers.\\" Old School Days (1886) was a \\"Book of the Week\\" in The Nation in June 1886. Harris also worked as a book reviewer for The Literary World starting in 1874. Excerpt from Little Folks' Every Day Book, Rhymes and Illustrations for Every Day (published 1881) During her career, Harris published dozens of works in a range of publications.  Personal life  Harris spent her entire life in Warner, New Hampshire, and would eventually die there at the age of 92, in 1917. Her funeral took place at her home, drawing \\"a large attendance from Concord and surrounding towns and with many remembrances of flowers from her former associates in literary work.\\" She was buried in Warner, New Hampshire.  Selected publications  Illustration on the inside of the cover of Wildflowers and Where They Grow (published 1882) = Major works =   * More of her works can be found online.

The album spent seven weeks on the Record World Album Charts, hitting a high of 177 on August 22, 1981. In March 1982, the band recorded two studio tracks with producer Mike Thorne, ‚ÄúMake that Move‚Äù, and ‚ÄúOne More Heartache‚Äù, which would later be released on 1983‚Äôs Make that Move EP for RCA Records. In August 1982 King began working with former Rockat Tim Scott McConnell and recorded the Sire Records EP Swear, produced by Richard Gottehrer. The backing band included former Boyfriends, and Holly and the Italians‚Äôs bass player Mark Sidgwick. The title track was later covered by Sheena Easton. During this period King also worked as a studio technician, assisting on a number of Richard Gottehrer recordings including the Bongos Numbers With Wings EP for RCA Records and Joe King Carrasco and the Crowns Party Weekend for MCA Records. King joined Beat Rodeo in 1985, recording 1986‚Äôs Scott Litt-produced Home in the Heart of the Beat for IRS Records. In 1987, King began working with singer songwriter Elliott Murphy, whose band included former Modern Lovers bass player Ernie Brooks. They recorded the album Change Will Come for the New Rose record label. In 1988 King joined his former Beat Rodeo partner George Usher in his band House of Usher. The group recorded the 1990 release ‚ÄúNeptune\\" for the Lonesome Whippoorwill label. Weiss reconnected with his former Rockats band-mates for sporadic reunion shows in 2008, 2012, and 2013, and recorded several tracks with them which appeared on the 2013 Lanark Records release Rockin‚Äô Together. =Television= Returning to his given name, Weiss began working for KCTS Television, Seattle‚Äôs PBS affiliate in 1992. Through 2003, Weiss helped manage national and international productions, including documentaries which were broadcast as part of the American Experience and American Masters series. In 2004 he began working for Seattle Channel, the city of Seattle‚Äôs government-access television station. Between 2007 and 2017, Weiss helped lead a team which won the Excellence in Government Programming award (often referred to as ‚Äúthe best municipal TV station in the nation‚Äù) from the National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors (NATOA), eight times. =Author= Weiss‚Äôs first book, Stranded in the Jungle: Jerry Nolan‚Äôs Wild Ride - A Tale of Drugs, Fashion, the New York Dolls, and Punk Rock, was released in September 2017. On September 14, 2017 it became the number one new release in Amazon.com‚Äôs ‚ÄúPunk Musician Biographies‚Äù category. On October 1, 2017, it hit number one. The forward was written by Chris Stein of Blondie. Reviews were mainly positive; Rob Ross wrote in popdose.com, ‚Äú‚Ä¶Mr. Weiss is a damned fine writer.

The story contains elements of metafiction and magical realism, and deals with the clash of modernization with the traditional, primitive way of life. Zhang Yang's 2016 film Soul on a String is based on this story and \\"On the Road to Lhasa\\", also by Tashi Dawa. Plot summary During a meeting with an aging rinpoche, a writer (the first-person narrator) realizes the rinpoche has met characters from an unfinished story of his. The writer returns and digs out his story from his chest, which begins with a young shepherd girl living by herself in the remote mountains. Normally she lives with her father, but as her father is away on one of his extended trips, her loneliness and boredom becomes unbearable. When she spots a young man passing by, she decides to sleep with him, abandon her home and follow him. The pilgrim does not love her, but tolerates her. They spend months climbing mountains and crossing rivers, ostensibly in search of Shambhala. Whenever they stop at a village, the young girl becomes fascinated by what modernization has to offer, but this agitates the pilgrim more and more. In one of their stops, the village head offers to keep the girl as his daughter-in-law, and the pilgrim agrees to abandon her. Meanwhile, the writer has decided to begin his journey to join his characters. When he \\"catches\\" them, the man is dying from an accident caused by a tractor, with the girl caring for him. They hear the live broadcast of the 1984 Summer Olympics reverberating in the mountains, and the man dies believing he has found enlightenment. English translations *\\"Souls Tied to the Knots on a Leather Cord\\" (translated by Jeanne Tai), in *\\"A Soul in Bondage\\" (translated by David Kwan), in *\\"Tibet: A Soul Knotted on a Leather Thong\\" (translated by Herbert J. Batt), in It was also translated into other languages, for example German (as \\"An den Lederriemen geknotete Seele\\" by Alice Gr√ºnfelder). Awards *8th National Short Story Prize awarded by China Writers Association Evaluation Tashi Dawa was strongly influenced by Latin American writers like Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez and Jorge Luis Borges, and magical realism figures prominently in his stories. Because he only writes in Chinese, his style has often been accused by Tibetans in exile as mystifying Tibet and perpetuating the ignorance of Tibet in China, but as pointed out by Patricia Schiaffini-Vedani, magical realism also allows him \\"to breach political, religious, and even sexual taboos\\". Adaptation Tashi Dawa and director Zhang Yang co-wrote the 2016 film Soul on a String, based on this story and \\"On the Road to Lhasa\\". The film stars Kimba and Choenyi Tsering in the lead roles.

In the face of slow politics of climate change delaying climate change mitigation, activists and lawyers have increased efforts to use national and international judiciary systems to advance the effort. Since the early 2000s, the legal frameworks for combatting climate change have increasingly been available through legislation, and an increasing body of court cases have developed an international body of law connecting climate action to legal challenges, related to constitutional law, administrative law, private law, consumer protection law or human rights. Many of the successful cases and approaches have focused on advancing the needs of climate justice and the youth climate movement. After the 2019 ruling in State of the Netherlands v. Urgenda Foundation, which gave binding requirements for the state of the Netherlands to address climate change, a growing trend of activist cases have begun being fought globally. 2019 saw a sharp rise in actions, and as of February 2020 Norton Rose Fulbright published a review identifying over 1400 cases in 33 countries. In early 2020, the most pending cases in any one country was in the United States, where over 1000 cases were being heard.  Types of action  Climate litigation typically engages in one of five types of legal claims: * Constitutional law  focused on breaches of constitutional rights by the state. * Administrative law  challenging the merits of administrative decision making within existing on-the-books laws, such as in granting permissions for high-emissions projects. * Private law - challenging corporations or other organizations for \\" as negligence, nuisance, trespass, public trust and unjust enrichment.\\" * Fraud or consumer protection - typically challenging companies for misrepresenting information about climate impacts. * Human rights  claiming that failure to act on climate change fails to protect human rights  By country  = United States = As of February 2020, the U.S. had the most pending cases with over 1000 in the court system.  Massachussets v. EPA  One of the first landmark climate change litigation cases was Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2007. The suit was brought by several American states against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after the EPA declined to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as part of their duty under the Clean Air Act (CAA) in 2003. The EPA had argued that their authority under the Clean Air Act were to regulate \\"air pollutants\\", which they claimed carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases did not fall under, so could not apply regulations. States, like Massachusetts, argued that these emissions could lead to climate change- related damages to their states, such as through rising ocean levels, and thus these emissions should be seen as harmful under the CAA and within the EPA's ability to regulate. While EPA initially won at the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court, on a 5-4 decision, agreed with the states that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases had been shown to be harmful, and required the EPA to regulate them. In 2015, a number of American youth, represented by Our Children's Trust, filed a lawsuit against the United States government in 2015, contending that their future lives would be harmed due to the government's inactivity towards mitigating climate change. While similar suits had been filed and dismissed by the courts for numerous reasons, Juliana v. United States gained traction when a District Judge Ann Aiken ruled that the case had merit to continue, and that \\"a climate system capable of sustaining human life\\" was a fundamental right under the United States Constitution. The United States government has since attempted to dismiss the case through various challenges to Aiken's findings but it remains pending in court actions. = Australia = As of February 2020, Australia had the second most number of cases pending in the world, with almost 200 cases. = Netherlands = In 2019, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands confirmed that the government must cut carbon dioxide emissions, as climate change threatens human health. The Netherlands had committed to reducing its carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 levels by 49% by 2030 with various intermediate targets. However, the Dutch Environmental Assessment Agency determined that the country would be missing its goals for 2020. In 2012, the Dutch lawyer Roger Cox gave the idea of judicial intervention to force action against climate change.Roger Cox, \\"It is time for the judiciary to step in and avert climate catastrophe\\" , The Guardian, 14 November 2012 (page visited on 6 November 2016). In 2013, the Urgenda Foundation, with 900 co-plaintiffs, has filed a lawsuit against the Government of the Netherlands \\"for not taking sufficient measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause dangerous climate change\\". In 2015, the District Court of The Hague ruled that the government of the Netherlands must do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to protect its citizens from climate change (Urgenda climate case).Urgenda climate case , Urgenda Foundation (page visited on 6 November 2016).Quirin Schiermeier, \\"Landmark court ruling tells Dutch government to do more on climate change\\" , Nature, 24 June 2015 (page visited on 5 November 2016).Arthur Neslen, \\"Dutch government ordered to cut carbon emissions in landmark ruling\\" , The Guardian, 24 June 2015 (page visited on 5 November 2016). It was described as a \\"precedent- setting judgment\\" and as the \\"world‚Äôs first climate liability suit\\". According to James Thornton, chief executive of Client Earth, \\"Most remarkably, it is based in essence on established science and the ancient principle of a government's duty of care. That reasoning is applicable in any legal system and will certainly be used by courts in other countries\\".It is also supported by the Oslo Principles on Global Climate Change Obligations . See Julia Powles and Tessa Khan, \\"Climate change: at last a breakthrough to our catastrophic political impasse?\\" , The Guardian, 30 March 2015 (page visited on 6 November 2016). In 2018, a court of appeal in The Hague has upheld the precedent- setting judgment that forces the Dutch government to step up its efforts to curb greenhouse-gas emissions in the Netherlands. In December 2019, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld the ruling on appeal, affirming that the government must cut carbon dioxide emissions by 25% from 1990 levels, by the end of 2020, on the basis that climate change poses a risk to human health. = Others = After the landmark ruling of the Netherlands in 2015, groups in other countries tried the same judicial approach.\\"The Climate Justice movement across the globe\\" , Greenpeace, 19 August 2015 (page visited on 6 November 2016).Jonathan Watts, \\"'We should be on the offensive' ‚Äì James Hansen calls for wave of climate lawsuits\\" , The Guardian, 17 November 2017 (page visited on 17 November 2017).Center for Public Integrity, \\"Venue of last resort: the climate lawsuits threatening the future of big oil \\" , The Guardian, 17 December 2017 (page visited on 17 December 2017).

In 2018, ten families from European countries, Kenya and Fiji filed a suit against the European Union for the threats against their homes caused by the EU greenhouse emissions. In Colombia, a group of children sued the government to protect the Amazon from deforestation due to the deforestation's contribution to climate change, and in 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the Colombian rainforest was an \\"entity subject of rights\\" requiring protection and restoration.

It was one of the provincial temples established by Emperor Sh≈çmu during the Nara period (710 - 794) for the purpose of promoting Buddhism as the national religion of Japan and standardising control of the Yamato rule to the provinces. The temple no longer exists, but the temple grounds were designated as a National Historic Site by the Japanese government in 1974. History The temple site is located in a paddy field about 2.5 kilometers south of the coast of Nanao city facing the Nanao Bay on the east coast of Noto Peninsula. The name of the neighbourhood is Kokubu, indicating that the now-vanished provincial capital of Noto Province was located in the close vicinity. As the result of an excavation survey conducted over three years from 1954, traces of the Lecture Hall, Pagoda, middle gate, southern gate, etc. were detected as well as the foundations of the Kon-d≈ç. The temple is believed to have been constructed in the late Hakuho period as Daiko-ji (Â§ßËààÂØ∫), a family temple for the Noto-no-omi clan, the local rulers of Noto. It was elevated to provincial temple status only in 843 AD, over a century after the creation of the provincial temple system by Emperor Sh≈çmu. One of the reasons for this delay was due to the history of Noto Province. Noto was created out of four districts of Echizen Province in 718, but was abolished and merged with Etch≈´ Province in 741, only to be reestablished in 757, after which it virtually disappears from history for two centuries. The Noto Kokubun-ji burned down after its pagoda caught fire due to lightning in 883. It reappeared briefly in 1532, when records indicate that Hatakeyama Yoshifusa, lord of Nanao Castle made a donation of one koku of rice to the temple, but disappeared from the historical record soon thereafter. The site is now a public historical park, where visitors can see the foundations of the Nara period buildings, and with reconstructions of some of the gates and walls of the temple complex.

The 115th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff between the American League champion Houston Astros and the National League champion Washington Nationals. The series was played from October 22 to October 30. The Nationals won the series, four games to three, to secure their first title in franchise history. Washington pitcher Stephen Strasburg was named the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after earning two wins in the series. The Astros had home-field advantage for the series, due to having a better regular-season record than the Nationals. It was the third World Series in which home-field advantage was decided by the regular- season records of the American and National league champions, a practice that started in the 2017 season. It was the first World Series in which the Houston Astros had home-field advantage. The series was played in a 2‚Äì3‚Äì2 format, with the Astros hosting Games 1, 2, 6, and 7; and the Nationals hosting Games 3, 4, and 5. For the first time in any of the major North American sports leagues, the visiting team won all seven games, The second time that the designated road team won every game in a series occurred during the 2020 NBA Eastern Conference semi-finals between Toronto and Boston, although technically all games were played in the same venue due to COVID-19 restrictions. surpassing the previous high of five. It was also the sixth straight World Series in which the championship was clinched by the visiting team. With the Nationals being from the National League East, the past six World Series winners have come from each of the divisions in Major League Baseball. For the third straight year, MLB sold presenting sponsorships to all of postseason series. As with the 2017 and 2018 World Series, this World Series was sponsored by YouTube TV and was officially known as the 2019 World Series presented by YouTube TV. Background This was the first World Series appearance for the franchise that began its existence as the Montreal Expos in 1969, and moved to Washington, D.C. in 2005 to become the Nationals. The Nationals were also the last team from the 1969 expansion class (which also included the Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers‚Äîwho began as the Seattle Pilots‚Äîand San Diego Padres) to earn a trip to the series. Their World Series appearance also means that all National League (NL) teams have played in at least one World Series. The only American League (AL) team that has yet to play in a World Series is the Seattle Mariners, who were part of the 1977 expansion. Prior this series, the Astros and Nationals had never played each other in a postseason series, despite Houston playing in the NL from 1962 to 2012. The Astros and Nationals did not play an interleague game in 2019, and last faced each other during the 2017 regular season. The two teams share a spring training site in West Palm Beach, Florida, and opened the 2019 spring training schedule against each other. This was the second World Series to feature two expansion teams, the first being in between the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets. =Washington Nationals= The Nationals finished the 2018 season with an 82‚Äì80 () win-loss record, and started the 2019 season with a 19‚Äì31 () record. Second-year manager Dave Martinez began to receive public pressure to be fired by the Nationals. The team engineered a turnaround and finished the season in second place in the National League East, four games behind the Atlanta Braves, ending the year with a 93‚Äì69 () record. The Nationals were one of two teams to qualify for the playoffs as a wild card team from the National League. Martinez had missed three games in September due to a cardiac catheterization procedure to treat angina. The Nationals defeated the Milwaukee Brewers at home in the National League Wild Card Game, coming behind from a 3‚Äì1 deficit in the eighth inning to win 4‚Äì3. The Nationals then defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers, who had won the previous two National League pennants, in the National League Division Series. The Nationals were behind two games to one, and won their second and third elimination games of the postseason to take the best-of-five series. The postseason series win was the first in Washington Nationals history. In the best-of-seven National League Championship Series, the Nationals eliminated the St. Louis Cardinals (who had defeated the Braves in the Division Series round) in four games to secure the first pennant in franchise history (including their time as the Montreal Expos from 1969 to 2004). It was the first World Series appearance for a team from Washington D.C. since , including 33 seasons that the city did not host an MLB team (1972‚Äì2004). =Houston Astros= In the prior two seasons, the Astros had won the 2017 World Series, the franchise's first World Series championship, and lost the 2018 American League Championship Series to the Boston Red Sox. The Astros finished the 2019 regular season atop the American League West‚Äîtheir third consecutive division championship‚Äîwith a 107‚Äì55 () win-loss record. Their 107 wins were a franchise record, and the most in MLB for the season. The Astros' first opponent in the postseason was determined by the American League Wild Card Game, which saw the Tampa Bay Rays defeat the Oakland Athletics. In the best-of-five American League Division Series, Houston defeated Tampa Bay in five games, with each game of the series being won by the home team. The Astros' opponent in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series (ALCS) was the New York Yankees, who had defeated the Minnesota Twins in their playoff series, three games to none. In the ALCS, the Astros and Yankee split the first two games, followed by the Astros winning two-of-three games played at Yankee Stadium. Game 6 in Houston was then won by the Astros, giving them the series win, four games to two. The Astros' ALCS victory advanced them to their third overall World Series appearance, and second in three years. Summary Game summaries The below game summaries include a line score of each game, showing the runs scored by each team during each inning. Various baseball terms appearing in the summaries can be found in the glossary of baseball. The performance of pitchers in a game is often summarized by wording such as \\"two runs on three hits while striking out four batters\\", indicating how many runs and hits the pitcher allowed (the fewer, the better) and how many opposing batters the pitcher struck out (the more, the better). =Game 1= Juan Soto batted 3-for-4 with three RBIs in Game 1. Before the national anthem, a moment of silence took place in honor of umpire Eric Cooper, who had died on October 20. Former Astro Brian McCann threw out the ceremonial first pitch to former teammate Evan Gattis. Max Scherzer started for the Nationals, while Gerrit Cole started for the Astros. With two outs in the bottom of the first inning, Yuli Gurriel hit a two-run double, giving the Astros a 2‚Äì0 lead. In the top of the second inning, Ryan Zimmerman hit a home run to cut the Astros' lead to 2‚Äì1. Juan Soto led off the top of the fourth inning with a home run to tie the game, 2‚Äì2. Soto became the fourth-youngest player to hit a home run in a World Series; Andruw Jones in 1996 was the youngest to date. Adam Eaton batted in a run in the top of the fifth inning, followed two batters later by a Soto two-run double, giving the Nationals a 5‚Äì2 lead. Scherzer exited after pitching five innings, having allowed two runs on five hits while striking out seven batters. Cole went seven innings, allowing five runs on eight hits while striking out six. After Nationals pitcher Patrick Corbin pitched a scoreless sixth, George Springer led off the bottom of the seventh inning with the 14th postseason home run of his career, off Nats relief pitcher Tanner Rainey. He also broke a World Series record held by Reggie Jackson and Lou Gehrig, with a home run in five consecutive World Series games, dating back to Game4 of the 2017 World Series. The Astros loaded the bases later in the inning with two walks off Rainey and an infield single off Daniel Hudson, but Hudson struck out Yordan √Ålvarez to prevent any more scoring. In the bottom of the eighth inning, pinch hitter Kyle Tucker singled, advanced to second on a fly ball by Aledmys D√≠az, and Springer batted in another run with a double, pulling the Astros to within one run, 5‚Äì4. Sean Doolittle, the Nationals' fifth pitcher of the game, got the final out of the eighth inning and retired the side in order in the bottom of the ninth, concluding matters when Carlos Correa lined out to V√≠ctor Robles to preserve the win. Doolittle earned his second save of the postseason and the underdogs took the series lead, marking the first time in franchise history that the Nationals won a World Series game. =Game 2= Stephen Strasburg earned the win in Game 2. Gymnast and Houston native Simone Biles threw out the ceremonial first pitch of Game2. The starting pitchers were Stephen Strasburg for the Nationals and Justin Verlander for the Astros. After a walk and a single to start the game, Anthony Rendon batted in two runs with a double. Alex Bregman tied the game with a two-run home run in the bottom of the first. In the top of the second inning, Verlander recorded the 200th postseason strikeout of his career, surpassing John Smoltz (whose career spanned 1988‚Äì2009) and setting a new MLB record. Leading off the top of the seventh, Kurt Suzuki hit a home run to put the Nationals ahead, 3‚Äì2. Verlander exited one batter later; he was charged with four runs on seven hits while striking out six batters, and was later assessed the loss. Washington scored five more runs in the seventh off Ryan Pressly, extending their lead to 8‚Äì2. With a six-run lead, Strasburg was removed before the bottom of the seventh, having held the Astros to two runs on seven hits while striking out seven. In the eighth inning, a two-run home run by Adam Eaton plus a run batted in (RBI) by Asdr√∫bal Cabrera extended the Nationals' lead to nine runs. A ninth-inning home run by Michael A. Taylor off Chris Devenski pushed the lead to 12‚Äì2. Astro Mart√≠n Maldonado hit a home run in the bottom of the ninth off relief pitcher Javy Guerra, but there was no further scoring as the Nationals completed their eighth consecutive playoff win. =Game 3= Michael Brantley was 2-for-4 with two RBIs in Game 3. This was the first World Series game played in Washington D.C. since October 7, 1933, which was the clinching Game5 of the New York Giants' win over the Washington Senators. Chad Cordero of the 2005 Nationals threw out the ceremonial first pitch to former teammate Brian Schneider; former astronaut Buzz Aldrin also threw a ceremonial pitch. An√≠bal S√°nchez started for the Nationals, while Zack Greinke started for the Astros. In the second inning, Josh Reddick batted in Carlos Correa as Houston scored the game's first run. In the third inning, Jos√© Altuve doubled and advanced to third on an error, then scored on an infield single by Michael Brantley, giving the Astros a 2‚Äì0 lead. The Nationals loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the third, but were unable to score. In the bottom of the fourth, Ryan Zimmerman walked then was driven in by a triple by V√≠ctor Robles, cutting the Astros' lead to 2‚Äì1. Houston restored their two-run lead in the top of the fifth, as Altuve doubled and was then batted in by Brantley. Greinke left with two outs in the bottom of the fifth, having allowed one run on seven hits while striking out six batters. The Astros extended their lead to 4‚Äì1 in the top of the sixth, as Robinson Chirinos hit a home run off the left field foul pole netting. S√°nchez lasted until one out in the top of the sixth, having allowed four runs on 10 hits while striking out four. With no additional scoring through the middle of the ninth, the Astros brought in closer Roberto Osuna to pitch the bottom of the ninth. Osuna allowed a one-out single to Adam Eaton, but otherwise retired the Nationals; Juan Soto struck out looking to end the National's eight-game playoff winning streak. Osuna earned his second save this postseason, as Houston narrowed Washington's lead in the series to 2‚Äì1. This became the first World Series to begin with three games won by the road team since 1996, when the first five games were won by the road team. =Game 4= Alex Bregman had five RBIs in Game 4, four on a grand slam. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by a Nationals Youth Baseball Academy scholar-athlete. Patrick Corbin started for the Nationals and Jos√© Urquidy started for the Astros. The Astros scored early, recording two runs in the first inning on four consecutive singles with one out. Robinson Chirinos hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning, extending Houston's lead to 4‚Äì0. Urquidy exited after five innings, having held the Nationals scoreless, retiring nine straight batters before being removed. Washington scored a run in the bottom of the sixth, coming on a Juan Soto ground out with the bases loaded and one out. Corbin pitched six innings, allowing four runs on seven hits while striking out five. A grand slam by Alex Bregman in the seventh inning extended Houston's lead to 8‚Äì1. It was the 20th ever World Series grand slam and first since Addison Russell hit one in Game6 of the 2016 World Series. With no further scoring, the Astros evened the series, 2‚Äì2, ensuring a sixth game in Houston. This was the fifth time a World Series started with the road team winning the first four games, the most recent occurrence having been 1996. =Game 5= The Astros batting in the top of the 2nd inning of Game 5 The ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by chef Jos√© Andr√©s. The starting pitchers were Gerrit Cole for Houston and Joe Ross for Washington. Max Scherzer was scheduled to start for Washington, but was scratched about three hours before the game due to neck spasms. A two-run home run by Yordan √Ålvarez in the top of the second inning gave the Astros an early lead. In the top of the fourth, Carlos Correa hit another two-run home run, extending Houston's lead to 4‚Äì0. Ross pitched for five innings, allowing four runs on five hits while striking out one batter. Juan Soto narrowed the lead to 4‚Äì1 with a home run in the bottom of the seventh. Yuli Gurriel batted in a run in the top of the eighth to restore the four-run lead. Cole left after seven innings, having held the Nationals to one run on three hits while striking out nine. George Springer's two-run home run in the top of the ninth stretched Houston's lead to 7‚Äì1. With Ryan Pressly ending the game by allowing no baserunners in the bottom of the ninth, the Astros moved to within a victory of their second title in three years. This became the third World Series‚Äîalong with and ‚Äîto have the road team win the first five games. U.S. President Donald J. Trump waves to the crowd. Home plate umpire Lance Barksdale's strike zone during the game drew attention, with some sports journalists, including Jeff Passan, increasing their appeals to MLB for a computerized strike zone. Two women in the crowd flashed their bare chests during the game‚Äîbriefly visible on television‚Äîin an attempt to raise awareness for their website, claiming proceeds from the site \\"will be going to women with breast cancer\\". Along with a third woman, they were removed from the game and were banned from all MLB stadiums \\"indefinitely\\". U.S. President Donald Trump was booed and \\"chants of 'Lock him up!' broke out in some sections\\" when he and wife Melania were introduced after the third inning during the regular serviceperson recognition segment. This led to some discussion in the media of the civility required of the event and the larger political discourse taking place. This was not the first time at a World Series that a President was booed;https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/10/28/history-booing- president-mlb-games-we-want-beer-lock-him-up/ at the 1931 World Series, taking place during Prohibition, fans in Philadelphia had chanted at Herbert Hoover, \\"We Want Beer! We want Beer!\\" =Game 6= Anthony Rendon contributed five RBIs in Game 6. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Hakeem Olajuwon to Clyde Drexler, both of whom played college basketball for the Houston Cougars and later won the 1995 NBA Finals with the Houston Rockets. Starting pitchers were Justin Verlander for Houston and Stephen Strasburg for Washington, the same as in Game2. Anthony Rendon batted in a run in the top of the first, giving the Nationals an early 1‚Äì0 lead. A sacrifice fly by Jos√© Altuve and a home run by Alex Bregman in the bottom of the first gave Houston a 2‚Äì1 lead. Bregman carried his bat to first base after homering, which some media members considered disrespectful. Fifth-inning home runs by Adam Eaton and Juan Soto gave the Nationals a 3‚Äì2 lead. Soto also carried his bat to first base after homering, mimicking Bregman. Post-game, both managers voiced displeasure with the bat-carrying; Bregman apologized and said he was at fault. Verlander exited after five innings, having allowed three runs on five hits while striking out three batters. In the top of the seventh inning, Trea Turner was controversially called out for interference on a play at first base, which Washington manager Dave Martinez furiously took issue with, leading to his ejection. Later that inning, a two-out, two-run home run by Rendon off Will Harris‚Äîwho had not allowed an earned run in the postseason‚Äîincreased Washington's lead to 5‚Äì2. Rendon batted in two more runs in the top of the ninth with a double off Chris Devenski, extending the Nationals' lead to 7‚Äì2. Strasburg left with one out in the bottom of the ninth, having held the Astros to two runs on five hits while striking out seven. Sean Doolittle relieved Strasburg, and allowed a two-out double to Carlos Correa, but nothing further, and the Nationals evened the series to force a deciding seventh game. This was the first instance in MLB, NBA, or NHL history where the road team won the first six games of a best-of-seven series. Interference call and Martinez ejection In the top of the seventh inning, the Nationals had a 3‚Äì2 lead with a runner, Yan Gomes, on first base with no outs when batter Trea Turner hit a swinging bunt to the third base side of the pitcher's mound. Astros pitcher Brad Peacock fielded the ball and threw it to first base; the ball was not caught by first baseman Yuli Gurriel and rolled into foul territory beyond the base, apparently giving the Nationals runners on second and third with no outs. However, Turner was called out by home plate umpire Sam Holbrook for interference, negating the play and requiring Gomes to return to first base. While initial reports and television commentary indicated the call was for running outside the runner's lane, MLB's chief baseball officer, Joe Torre, clarified after the game that Turner had interfered with Gurriel's attempt to catch the ball, stating that Turner \\"did run to the fair side of the 45-foot line, but really the violation was when he kept Gurriel from being able to catch the ball at first base.\\" The call led to a delay of nearly minutes while umpires confirmed their interpretation of the rules (the decision itself was a judgment call not reviewable via MLB instant replay). The call was argued by Nationals manager Dave Martinez when it was first made and again, more intensely, during the seventh-inning stretch, resulting in his ejection by Holbrook. It was the first ejection in a World Series since , when Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox had been ejected. =Game 7= Patrick Corbin (shown here with the Diamondbacks) was the winning pitcher in Game 7. This was the 40th time a World Series reached its deciding Game 7. The starting pitchers were Washington's Max Scherzer, who won Game1, and Houston's Zack Greinke, who received a no decision in Game3, making this the first World Series Game7 started by two previous Cy Young Award winners. Ceremonial first pitches were thrown by former Astros Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio. A home run by Yuli Gurriel in the bottom of the second inning gave the Astros an early 1‚Äì0 lead. Carlos Correa hit a two-out RBI single in the bottom of the fifth inning to extend the lead to 2‚Äì0. Scherzer pitched five innings, allowing two runs on seven hits while striking out three batters. Greinke had given up only one hit (a single) before Anthony Rendon's home run in the top of the seventh cut the Astros' lead to 2‚Äì1. Greinke walked Soto after Rendon's homer and was then replaced by Will Harris. Harris gave up a two-run home run to Howie Kendrick off the right field foul pole, giving the Nationals a 3‚Äì2 lead, which they never relinquished. Greinke was charged with two runs on two hits while striking out three in innings. Roberto Osuna pitched the eighth inning for Houston, when Juan Soto batted in Adam Eaton with two outs to give Washington a two-run lead. The Nationals extended their lead to 6‚Äì2 in the ninth inning, with two runs scoring on a one-out single by Eaton with the bases loaded. With Patrick Corbin having pitched three scoreless innings in relief for Washington, Daniel Hudson came in to pitch the bottom of the ninth and retired the side in order, as Michael Brantley struck out swinging to give the Nationals franchise their first World Series title in 51 seasons, and the city's first since the Senators won in . The Nationals' win marked the sixth straight year that a team clinched the World Series title via a win on the road, including four times that a Game7 was won by the visiting team. For the first time in major North American sports history, the visiting team won all seven games of a best-of-seven postseason series. In championship series of the NBA, NHL, and MLB contested during 2019, road teams compiled an overall 17‚Äì3 record. During postgame ceremonies, Washington's Stephen Strasburg was presented with the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, the first time a former No. 1 overall draft pick earned the award. =Series statistics= 2019 World Series (4‚Äì3): Washington Nationals (NL) beat Houston Astros (AL). The Nationals wore their alternate blue jerseys for all seven games. Broadcasting =Television= The World Series was televised by Fox for the 20th straight year. Joe Buck called the games as play-by-play announcer along with John Smoltz as color commentator and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters.

Formation  The volcano complex lies in the East Eifel between the villages of Ettringen and Kottenheim and the town of Mayen on the edge of a fault zone of the Middle Rhine Basin. Violent movements caused disturbances in the bedrock, so that, along this fault, magma rose from a chamber at a depth of 10-20 km. Volcanic activity began approximately 200,000 years ago in the eastern part of the Bellerberg Volcano. Gaseous, 1,100 ¬∞C hot magma reached the earth's surface at several eruption centres and formed smaller cinder cones. Huge quantities of lava fragments, which were thrown mainly in an easterly direction, formed the cinder ridge of the Kottenheimer B√ºden. Gradually, a crescent-shaped crater wall formed, which probably grew to more than 20 m high within a few days.Vulkanpark GmbH, Tafel 1 am Geopfad Ettringer Bellerberg In addition, longer fissures appeared, which produced large quantities of lava and thus gave rise to the Ettringer Bellerberg. At a later date, gas pressure from the magma chamber decreased and the explosive fountains dried up. Instead, three lava streams flowed out of the Bellerberg Volcano which, thousands of years later were to become the basis of the economy in the surrounding villages in the form of basalt lava deposits: the Ettringer lava stream, the Mayen lava stream and the Winfeld lava stream. The Ettringen lava stream was the shortest, but most powerful of the three, and later formed the quarry area of the Ettringer Lay. The longest was the Mayen lava stream. Lava flowed more than 3 kilometres south into the valley of the Nette and was the basis for the quarries of the Mayener Grubenfeld. The northern stream, the Winfeld lava stream, became the quarry area of Kottenheimer Winfeld. * Angelika Hunold: Das Erbe des Vulkans.

The work was painted in the fall of 1912, possibly on the Mississagi River. It depicts an area desolate and damaged due to flooding via damming. It was purchased by the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto in 1937 and has remained in the collection ever since. It was produced near the beginning of Thomson's short art career, just as he was beginning a transition from commercial art into full-time painting. Background In 1912 after Thomson's initial experience of visiting Algonquin Park, he and his colleague William Broadhead went on a two-month expedition up the Spanish River and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today Mississagi Provincial Park). Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his original style of painting began to be apparent around this time. Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, has been lost due to two canoe spills experienced during the trip, the first spill being on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids. Analysis Thomson's art director while at Grip Ltd., Albert Robson, identified Drowned Land as being painted on the Mississagi Forest Reserve canoe trip. Art historian David Silcox has suggested that it was perhaps painted on Lake Scugog or near Owen Sound. It was painted with oil on paper, which was further embossed with canvas texture, all mounted on plywood. A similar support was used for View Over a Lake: Shore with Houses. Near Owen Sound, November 1911. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa The painting came right as Thomson was transitioning from commercial art into fine art and indicates his innate talent. It is similar to a sketch from the previous year, Near Owen Sound, in terms of colour, drawing and texture. On display is a \\"camera-like precision\\" and his incredible attention to detail in capturing scenes. Indeed, David Silcox has speculated that Drowned Land as well as other paintings may have been completed with a photograph as a memory aid given their \\"uncanny precision.\\" The painting is especially notable for its skill of composition and precision, especially when compared with some of Thomson's other work from this period, such as The Canoe and Old Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park. These early sketches show how he had not yet established his own form of expression, being particularly dark and dreary compared to his later work. The subject of desolation was uncommon for the time, having not been seen in Canadian painting since the works of topographers in the early- nineteenth century. The painting, like others from this period, depicts ideal fishing territory that Thomson likely would have enjoyed. Many of his paintings were overt in their depictions of the lumber industry, including dams, pointers, alligators and drives, the presence of industry being on his mind from early on. Drowned Land however is more subtle as it does not directly display any logging equipment. Instead, it presents the damage caused by logging operations and flooding due to damming. A hopeful recovering growth is apparent in the distance behind the skeleton of trees in the foreground. File:Thomson, Old Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park.jpgOld Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park, Spring 1912.

The campus was designed in Neo-Gothic style with Romanesque influence by state architect Holm Munthe, and opened in October 1898.  History  = Establishment = Today‚Äôs campus grounds were once occupied by a large toad pond, which is said to have been enjoyed by the local youth. At the time, it was located in the countryside. Upon its inception, there were a total of 1299 students receiving education in two shifts, one in the morning (8:00-12:00), and one in the afternoon (12:00-16:00). The campus is split into two schoolyards, originally done to keep boys and girls separated, it is now used to split higher and lower grades (1-4, 5-7). For a long time, the school was one of the largest of its kind in the country. Around the year of 1907, the school experienced its highest student count at 2021 students total. = Culture = 'Boltel√∏kka Skoles Musikkorps' (Boltel√∏kka School's Marching Band) was founded as a boy's marching band as early as 1902, by then headmaster H. Tr√¶tteberg. The marching band was later dissolved, but by 1931 it was reorganised and started anew. In 1960, girls were finally allowed to join the marching band alongside boys. Margrethe Munthe served as a teacher from 1902 till 1920, whereafter she retired and moved to Italy. Margrethe Munthe Square is located close to the school. In May 2001, during a state visit to Norway, Queen Elizabeth II & Prince Philip made a visit to the school. A performance was held by a class of third graders, reciting english versions of popular children's songs and a short play. The visit lasted for one hour, whereafter the Queen and her consort were taken to the Oslo City Hall for an exhibition in British design. = Second World War = On the 4th of May 1940, during the German occupation of Norway, the school was requisitioned by German forces and used as barracks. The school was released to its former function from August 19, 1940, to April 4, 1942, whereafter it was again fully requisitioned by German forces. During the 'Liberation of Finnmark,' the school served as accommodation for the evacuated from November 1944 through to February 8, 1945. From the 8th of February 1944, the school along with its headmaster & custodian courters were requisitioned by 'Hirdens bedriftsvern' (Hirden's Industry Protection Service). Following the liberation of Norway the school was used by the Red Cross as a gathering point for newly released prisoners of war. On the 18th of July 1945, the school was finally freed and restored to its intended purpose.  Today  As of 2017, the school teaches 422 students in grades 1-7 and employs 54 members of staff. The campus offers a solid selection of playground venues including jungle gyms, football fields, a mini- pitch, a stickball field and a basketball field. Newly refurbished is the workshop, gathering room along with the addition of two new classrooms. As of the 2017-2018 'Skoleraporten' the school has scored above national average in all three categories tested; English, Reading & Maths. = Principals = * 2016-: Ronny Sollien Engebr√•ten * 2007-2016: Dag Harald Gomn√¶s  References   External links  * https://skoleporten.udir.no/ - Official Nation Wide Testing Program * https://boltelokka.osloskolen.no/ - Boltel√∏kka Skole Website * http://www.oslobilder.no/search?searchstring=%22Boltel%C3%B8kka%20skole%22 - Archival Images of the School Category:Schools in Oslo ","title":"Boltel√∏kka Skole"},{"id":"58563387","text":"is a Japanese professional baseball catcher for the Orix Buffaloes in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball.

Biography  Zhukov was a radio engineer by trade, working in the Nizhny Novgorod branch of the Russian division as an international telephone operator. Due to the nature of his job, he often went on business trips to various cities in Russia. He was married, and he and his wife were raising a foster child. Between 1999 and 2007, Zhukov abducted and raped girls aged between 7 and 12 years. In January 2003, he committed three rapes in Novosibirsk during a business trip, but this could not be proven due to none of the victims being located. In August 2004, he killed a 9-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl in the Bogorodsky District. On June 24, 2006, he kidnapped and killed a 9-year-old girl in the village of Voskresenskoye, throwing her body into a lake outside Nizhny Novgorod. In August 2007, he was arrested: one of his rape victims managed to memorize the car as well as the view from the window of Zhukov's apartment. After his detention, he confessed to 26, and then 32 total crimes committed in Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk and Yaroslavl. He was investigated for involvement in similar crimes in other cities, where he traveled on business trips. On September 15, 2008, the Nizhny Novgorod Regional Court found Vladimir Zhukov guilty of three murders and 11 rapes and sentenced him to life imprisonment. In addition, the court decided that the convicted should pay 2.8 million rubles in compensation to the victims' families. On April 28, 2009 he was sentenced by the Novosibirsk Regional Court to 11 years' imprisonment for 3 rapes committed in Novosibirsk in January 2003. This verdict was incorporated into the life imprisonment. It is suggested that Zhukov committed many more crimes in several regions in Russia. He is serving his sentence in the White Swan prison. In September 2010, he confessed to the abduction of a girl of 8‚Äì10 years in 2002 in the city of Gorodets, followed by a rape and murder in the Koverninsky District.

In conventional technologies, a wafer is diced first, and then individual dies are packaged; package size is usually considerably larger than the die size. By contrast, in standard WLP flows integrated circuits are packaged while still part of the wafer, and the wafer (with outer layers of packaging already attached) is diced afterwards; the resulting package is practically of the same size as the die itself. However, the advantage of having a small package comes with a downside of limiting the number of external contacts that can be accommodated in the limited package footprint; this may become a significant limitation when complex semiconductor devices requiring a large number of contacts are considered. Fan-out WLP was developed to relax that limitation. It provides a smaller package footprint along with improved thermal and electrical performance compared to conventional packages, and allows having higher number of contacts without increasing the die size. In contrast to standard WLP flows, in fan-out WLP the wafer is diced first. But then the dies are very precisely re-positioned on a carrier wafer or panel, with space for fan-out kept around each die. The carrier is then reconstituted by molding, followed by making redistribution layer atop the entire molded area (both atop the chip and atop the adjacent fan-out area), and then forming solder balls on top.

Network. It was released on November 17, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and iOS. The Nintendo Switch version was released on May 31, 2018. The game involves a female cyborg's mission to defeat a villain named Judas and his robot minions, and can be played in a linear manner from beginning to end like a typical game. Alternately, the player may disobey the narrator's instructions and in doing so break the fourth wall. The game received positive reviews from critics, who commended it as a good video game in its own right, elevated by its unusual meta-commentary.  Plot  The game revolves around Icey, a female cyborg who is on a mission to kill the evil Judas, who has supposedly destroyed the world, for unclear reasons. She fights against various small and large robotic enemies. However, if the player strays outside the directions given to them by the narrator, he becomes frustrated and even angry. At this point the game devolves into a meta-commentary on game development, with the game's developer even talking directly to the player.  Gameplay  The game plays as a 2D hack-and-slash game. The player uses a single weapon, but can perform quick combos with their sword. There is no block, but rather a dash that allows the player to become invulnerable - the player can also refill their shields by killing stunned enemies with a special kill move.  Development  The game initially contained Chinese voice-overs with English subtitles, but English and Japanese-language voice-overs were later added.  Reception  ICEY received an aggregate score of 84/100 for its Windows version on Metacritic. Sawovsky of PLAY! Zine rated the game 8/10, calling the gameplay \\"excellent\\" and the meta-story \\"amusing\\", but criticizing its short length. Mateusz Zdanowicz of Eurogamer Poland rated the game 9/10 and gave it the Eurogamer Recommended award, calling the game \\"addictive\\" and its story \\"intriguing\\". Richard Atkinson of Nintendo Life rated the game 8/10, saying that while the game is short, exploring is enjoyable and the storytelling delivery \\"ingenious\\", but criticized its \\"simplistic\\" approach to battles. Sales The game sold over 2 million copies by August 2018.

History Dorothy was born in Unley Park, South Australia, a daughter of architect Alfred Edward Simpson and his wife Frances Isabella Simpson, n√©e Kell. She was educated at Walford House School where she was head prefect and editor of the school magazine. In 1924 she qualified for a diploma from the South Australian branch of the Australasian Massage Association and opened a private physiotherapy practice which she maintained until a few weeks before her death. She was in 1958 a foundation member of the Physiotherapy Society of South Australia. For twenty years she worked part-time at the Adelaide Children's Hospital, where she encountered many cases of infantile anterior poliomyelitis, an acute infectious viral disease affecting the brain and spinal cord, causing weakness, paralysis, and wasting of muscle, for which the classic treatment was bed rest and immobilization of affected limbs. Finnis however was convinced of the efficacy of treatments espoused by Sister Kenny, of actively re-educating individual muscles. She made a major contribution during the polio epidemic of 1937‚Äì1938 and later. She served on several committees of the Crippled Children's Association of South Australia and was president from 1945 to 1957 of the Spastic Children's Parents' Group, later known as the Crippled Children's Auxiliary (Spastic Group). Between 1944 and 1964 Finnis gave lectures on physiotherapy at the University of Adelaide and supervised practical classes in paediatrics at the Children's Hospital. She was from 1952 to 1965 the University's representative on the Physiotherapists' Board of South Australia. Recognition *Dorothy Kell Finnis was appointed M.B.E. in 1953 in recognition of her services as President of the Crippled Children's Auxiliary (Spastic Centre), and invested by the Queen during her 1954 Australian tour. erroneously referred to as president of the Crippled Children's Association. *She was in 1965 made a life member of the Children's Hospital house committee in recognition of her service dating from 1948. Other interests Finnis was a knowledgeable music lover, having studied piano at an advanced level, and was from 1932 a member of Adelaide's Tatlers Club, a literary society. She was a regular church-goer, an adherent of the Church of England and, with her husband, a foundation member of the Friends of St Peter's Cathedral (founded 1932), and active in that group until 1954. Personal Dorothy Simpson married the widowed Rev., later Canon, Horace Percy Finnis (died 1960) on 6 January 1945. The reverend gentleman, apart from his other religious duties, served as organist of St. Peter's Cathedral, having succeeded J. M. Dunn in 1936. They lived at the cathedral vicarage, moving to Rose Park in 1955. They had no children. She died in hospital of myocardial infarction and her remains were buried in the North Road cemetery.

The tumulus is orientated east-west, and has a total length of 54 meters. The circular portion is 29 meters in diameter and the rectangular front portion is 25 meters in width. The tumulus was surrounded by a moat with an average width of 10 meters. During construction work in 1932, a 2.7 meter long sarcophagus made of tuff was discovered. Inside were the bone of a youth, along with an extraordinary amount of grave goods, including weapons, bronze mirrors, amor, jewellery (silver bands, gold and copper balls, round and tubular beads).

The inscription mentioned three people named Hang Tahi, Si Rangit, and Kabayin Pu Anyawari who made an idol house. The use of two languages, namely Old Malay and Old Batak, raises the notion that the community around the area was bilingual. In addition, the mentioning of three articles Hang, Si, and Pu (Mpu) in the people names (Tahi, Ranggit, and Kabayin Anyawari) also reflects the characteristic habit of a Malay speaking people.

It was designed and built by William Cox from 1814, with the support of a convict road party. It is also known as 1814 Road, Old Bathurst Road, Old Western Road and Coxs Road. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 31 July 2015.  History  The road from Emu Ford to Bathurst, a distance of was completed in only six months during 1814 and 1815 by a working party composed mostly of convicts. Governor Lachlan Macquarie decided to have a carriage road constructed across the Blue Mountains, to the country which had been \\"newly discovered\\" by Europeans in 1813. The so called \\"First Crossing\\" of 1813 took place on the traditional lands of the Dharug, Gundungurra and Wiradjuri people. Other routes through the ridges and valleys of the Blue Mountains had been used by Aboriginal people for tens of thousands of years. Cox was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset in 1764. He married Rebecca Upjohn at Devizes, Wiltshire in 1789. Cox arrived in NSW on board the \\"Minerva\\" in January 1800. Cox became Chief Magistrate at Windsor in 1810 and in July 1814 Governor Macquarie made William Cox the Superintendent of the works for a new road over the Blue Mountains. His first wife died in 1819 and Cox married Anna Blachford in 1821. He died on 15 March 1837. Cox's road party reached the Linden area by late August 1814, and remained at Linden - Woodford until around mid-September, by which time they had moved on to the present day vicinity of Hazelbrook. It was the first time they encountered the steep rocky platforms, and the ever-narrowing ridge. Cox's style of road-building was pragmatic and primitive. Confronted with rocky platforms and sharp drops, he generally had his men clear the flattest parts, removing an \\"immense quantity of rock\\" where necessary, and usually marking out the line with shallow chiselled gutters and utilising the rock platform as a pavement; where the road ran over the shallow soils, it was often marked out by rows or low walls of rough, broken stone. The construction and completion of the road is recorded in Cox's Journal. Cox's journal indicates that three areas in particular required extensive cutting through rocky outcrops, at Linden to Woodford, Wentworth Falls and the descent at Mount York. Cox wrote describing the Linden - Woodford area as follows:Cox's journal, C708-2, Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales, digitised at: http://www.acmssearch.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/itemDetailPaged.cgi?itemID=457616\\"Memoirs of William Cox, JP\\", William Brooks and Co, 1901 The actual building of the road involved the definition of a trafficable route which was then cleared of vegetation (trees being cut-off below ground level but rarely \\"grubbed out\\"), boulders and rocky outcrops. The formation of the road itself was as minimal as the terrain allowed, with low side-cuttings and embankments as necessary. In very rocky terrain cuttings were made into the mountain itself, the natural rock providing the road surface or pavement. It is possible that some of the stepped rock platforms may have initially been partly filled or levelled with earthen ramps, although Karskens (1988) suggests that Cox mostly left the road pavement in an unformed, natural state due to the haste with which the road was being constructed. By 1817, (and for two decades after) the Linden to Woodford section was according to botanist, Allan Cunningham, \\"the most rugged and oppressive stage of the whole journey on account of the sandstone rocks on which the road is formed\\". He also noticed that the NSW Government carters had already created \\"small circuitous routes in the bush\\". Even if it was initially partly filled or shaped, much of the original surface of the road weathered away quickly, as by 1819 it was reported that the stumps of the trees which had been left within the roadway were becoming exposed. Numerous accounts of subsequent journeys over the Cox's Road in the \\"Twenty Mile Hollow\\" area (between Linden and Woodford) describe the difficult passage over the slippery sandstone surface and the uncomfortable jolting over the stepped rock platforms. It also appears that some minor secondary routes and deviations from the main track were also developed from an early period in order to avoid some of the more difficult descents. In 1824 it was reported that: \\"Four miles beyond Springwood [the road] becomes rough, rocky and at times very difficult. It has been necessary to cut it through rocks, and sometimes to fill the hollows of the gullies. The road is often made of the sandstone itself, and so it is slippery and difficult for horses and vehicles.\\" From the 1820s onwards, the earlier lines of road were upgraded and although short sections of Cox's Road were later adopted as parts of the local road network (eg. part of Burke Road, Linden and Old Bathurst Road and Taylor Road, Woodford) most of the original Cox's Road appears to have gone out of use with the completion of new road deviations by convict gangs during the 1820s and 1830s. When Mrs Louisa Meredith travelled through the area in 1839 she still endured the jolting and bumping over the \\"jumpers\\", the rock steps of Cox's Road and she wrote also that 'The track we are now traversing usually winds \\"terrace-wise along the side of a steep mountain, and is barely wide enough anywhere to allow of two vehicles passing each other\\".  Description  William Cox had been instructed by Governor Macquarie only to open a rough cart road, so that the new lands found in the western plains would be symbolically open. The road from Emu Ford to Bathurst, a distance of was completed in only six months. Macquarie's instructions specified that the road should be at least wide in order that two carts would be able to pass each other, and that the timber should be cleared on each side so that the road corridor was wide. Stumps were to be grubbed out and any holes should be filled in. This was the method adopted in relatively easy terrain, although later travellers reported that the stumps had not always been removed and the surviving physical evidence shows relatively few locations where the extant road conforms with the dimensions specified in the instructions. The Old Bathurst Road section of Cox's Road at Woodford is one of the most easily accessible, largely intact and still clearly recognisable surviving sections of the 1814 road within the Blue Mountains. It extends for over a kilometre beside and overlapping with an unsurfaced local road along the top of the ridge. It can be accessed either from Hepburn Road or from Old Bathurst Road and Taylor Road, Woodford. The remains of the 1814 road are the central feature of the ridge-top landscape. They relate historically, physically and visually to the undisturbed bush landscape to the east and to the various later transport and settlement developments to the west. From the apex of the ridge near the Woodford Trig Station there are extensive views on both sides of the road which conform with those described by early travellers giving a sense of the experience of travel along the early 19th century road even though parts of the surrounding area have been gradually developed with infrastructure such as sewerage pumping stations, pipelines and electricity power poles. This section of the 1814 Cox's Road extends for approximately . The 1814 road occupies the crest of the south running ridge, partly within the line of a more modern unsealed access track which leads from Hepburn Road to the Woodford Trig station and partly within adjoining private property allotments, most of which remain undeveloped. From the Woodford Trig Station the road continues past the Rockcorry Cottages where it is known as Old Bathurst Road. The road then coincides with modern Taylor Road for at least . Once the modern roughly formed vehicular access track leads off Hepburn Road at Linden, the remains of the Cox's Road evident consist primarily of a series of intermittent kerb-lines or low side-cuttings, some with shallow gutters or drains, which have been cut into the surface of the exposed sandstone rock platforms of the ridge. On the basis of the generally intended width of the road noted in the documentary evidence, and by observation of the topography, it is also possible to infer the probable position and line of the early road formation. Between Hepburn Road and the Woodford Trigonometrical Station (TS483) at least sixteen sections of side-cutting or kerbing relating to Cox's Road are present, along with a taller picked rock-face and curved side drain apparently associated with, but slightly away from, the road formation. Immediately west of the Woodford Trig Station, kerb-lines are cut on both sides of the road which extend here for , but mostly the kerb appears to be marked on only one side of the road formation. A fence marks private property here, where the road lies within Lot 2, DP 1083452, but the old road can be clearly viewed from outside. (loc: -33.726737,150.49331). The width of the old road formation varies between in the area between the two side kerb-lines near the Woodford Trig station, to about . These are wider dimensions than those specified in Macquarie's road building Instructions. The height of most kerb- lines is in the range of but may reach a maximum of about . Most of the kerbs are cut with vertical faces. Two types of marks are evident, implying the use of different tools during the cutting. Tools used would have included picks and mallets with pointed chisels or gads; as well as crow-bars, sledgehammers and wedges. Karskens (1988) has commented that the very low kerbs would \\"serve little practical purpose except as slight drainage, but they marked the edge of the road for the guidance of travellers in these wild, barren and isolated expanses.\\" The most extensive, but often quite shallow, kerb-line occurs on the western side of the road, towards the northern end of the extant 1814 road formation. This section extends for a total length of about , although not all of the kerb is fully exposed. (loc: -33.724190,150.494412). Two types of pavement are evident along this surviving section of Cox's Road. Much of the road in this area utilises the natural rock platform, some areas of which appear to have been partly \\"knocked-off\\" or picked away. Some areas also have deep ruts, apparently caused by both early and more recent traffic along the road. At the northern end, parts of the road formation or pavement appear to have been partly filled with small rock pieces or broken stone packing and the naturally occurring sandy earth loam. South of the Woodford Trig station past the Rockcorry Cottages, there is a cutting along the south side of the road and a solid sheet stone pavement. As the road continues south there are sections of early stone retaining wall on the east side of Old Bathurst Road. Two sections of walling are about long. The stonework is of two types, basic rubble work and very primitive coursed work, suggesting that there may be more than one phase of construction. It is likely that the better quality coursed work might relate to later 1820s improvements made to the earlier road. From Taylor Road the 1814 formation makes a brief dog-leg, then heads further west, continuing close to the southern side of the railway line before re-emerging near Woodford Railway Station. In the vicinity of the Woodford Trig station in addition to the line of the 1814 road, there are a number of other early tracks including a loop to the east. It is likely that these are some of the early diversions made to avoid jolting over the slippery rock platforms of the original 1814 road. These were described by numerous travellers. The proposed State Heritage Register listing of Cox's Road and Early Deviations includes six precincts of Cox's Road: *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Linden, Linden Precinct - HC Plan 2639 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Woodford, Old Bathurst Road Precinct - HC Plan 2640 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Woodford, Appian Way Precinct - HC Plan 2641 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Mount York , Cox's Pass Precinct - HC Plan 2642 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Hartley, Clarence Hilly Range / Mount Blaxland Precinct - HC Plan 2643 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Sodwalls, Fish River Descent Precinct - HC Plan 2644 = Condition = As at 17 November 2014, the condition of the road was good and substantially intact. Numerous archaeological features from the 1814 road are evident including road fabric, gutters, cuttings. = Modifications and dates = *1817; 1824  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries shows the route of the road As at 5 August 2015, The surviving remnants of Cox's Road, built 1814 to 1815, have state significance as the earliest road across the Blue Mountains and the first structure built by Europeans west of the Blue Mountains. Building of this road followed from the prior exploration by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth, and the survey by George Evans. The successful construction of the road was symbolic of the conquest of the natural barrier created by the Blue Mountains, and represented Governor Macquarie's vision for the ongoing development of the colony beyond Sydney and its immediate surrounds. Cox's Road enabled the later opening of the hinterland beyond the Blue Mountains for subsequent settlement, pastoral and agricultural expansion, which then escalated the dispossession of Aboriginal peoples from their lands. William Cox was well known among convicts for his power to recommend pardons and tickets of leave. Most of the convicts who volunteered for the work to open a track to the interior were emancipated, receiving pardons or Tickets of Leave on completion of the work. The surviving road fabric demonstrates the crude and hurried nature of Cox's work, and the techniques used in tracing, cutting and forming the road. In conjunction with later colonial road alignments on the mountains and elsewhere, Cox's Road also forms part of a suite of roads demonstrating the wide range of road building styles and standards employed during the colonial period. Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Woodford, Old Bathurst Road Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 31 July 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Constructed in 1814-15 Cox's Road is one of the earliest Colonial-era road-lines surviving in Australia. The 1814 road is tangible evidence of the development of the colony at Sydney and of the expansion of white settlement into western NSW. The road symbolises the occupation of the country and Governor Macquarie's aspirations for the eventual opening of the interior to European settlement after the discovery of the Western plains by G. W. Evans in 1814. In this respect the 1814-1815 Cox's Road has considerable symbolic significance as an official public work which laid the foundations for future development. Cox's Road is linked with the foundation of Bathurst, the first inland settlement in NSW, which was proclaimed by Governor Macquarie on 7 May 1815 after his journey along the road. Surviving remnants of Cox's Road have State historical significance as physical evidence of the first road constructed across the Blue Mountains from Emu Plains to the Bathurst Plains (1814-15). The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The surviving remnants of Cox's Road have State significance for their close association with Governor Lachlan Macquarie who commissioned the building of the road into the interior, and with the magistrate and ex-army officer Captain William Cox, who supervised the building of the road. The road is also associated with the convicts who laboured on the road to obtain their liberty, and with the officers and men who assisted Cox such as Thomas Hobby, Richard Lewis, John Tighe and Samuel Ayres. The crossing of the Blue Mountains, the surveying of a route to Bathurst and the building of Cox's Road were significant events in the period of Macquarie's governorship. Governor Macquarie's view of the importance of the road is demonstrated by his reports to Earl Bathurst, the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, and by his journey to the Bathurst Plains immediately after its construction, where he proclaimed the site for the Bathurst township. William Cox's achievement using a small group of convict men in a short period of time and with no loss of life caused by road-making or other substantial difficulties, was reflective of his reputation as a more humane employer and magistrate than many of his contemporaries. The leadership qualities, vision and skill he showed constructing the road would also be evident in later government contracts won by Cox for other public works. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The surviving precincts of Cox's Road have state technical significance for their ability to demonstrate simple, pre 1820s road building techniques. Improvement of the 1814 route throughout the 1820s also provide important evidence of later road building techniques and demonstrates the ongoing use of this key route to the interior, before it was superseded by the new Great Western Road laid out by Sir Thomas Mitchell in the 1830s. The Old Bathurst Road Precinct of Cox's Road is one of the longest, largely intact and still legible surviving sections of the 1814 road. It extends for over a kilometre beside and overlapping with an unsurfaced local road along the top of the ridge. The remains of the 1814 road are the central feature of the ridge-top landscape. They relate historically, physically and visually to the undisturbed landscape to the east and to the various later transport and settlement developments to the west. From the apex of the ridge near the Woodford Trig Station there are extensive views on both sides of the road which conform with those described by early travellers giving a sense of the experience of travel along the early nineteenth century road even though parts of the surrounding area have been gradually developed with infrastructure such as sewerage pumping stations, pipelines and electricity power poles. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cox's Road and its remnants are demonstrated as having social significance by the substantial interest in identifying and promoting Cox's Road for cultural tourism and education, and celebrating the bicentenary of the road by the general public, state and local government bodies and a range of community organisations. The road is of particular importance to Cox descendants. The William Cox Fellowship first nominated sections of Cox's Road for heritage listing in the 1980s. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Precincts of Cox's Road have research significance at a State level for their ability to demonstrate early nineteenth century road, culvert and bridge building techniques using basic skills and technologies. The remains of the 1814-15 road illustrate the conditions of the period and contribute to an understanding of the process of exploration and development, and of early colonial road building and road use. The remains represent a major physical, technological and engineering achievement and exhibit fine details of workmanship. Several precincts of the 1814-15 road have specific archaeological potential. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Surviving precincts of the 1814-1815 Cox's Road from Penrith to Bathurst are rare examples of early Colonial road building in NSW. The surviving remnants of Cox's Road have State significance as a rare example of pre 1820 road building based on the use of manual and primitive tools, and predating the more sophisticated road survey and construction techniques employed on the later \\"Great Roads\\" of the 1820s and 1830s.

He was an introvert, and did not stand out from other children. He later explained the rape of children by the desire to \\"try virginity\\", and the murders - the unwillingness to be discovered.  Arrest, trial and sentence  It was the desire to hide his crimes that drove Burtsev. After one of the crimes, he asked an elderly woman who lived nearby for a spade, with which he buried the corpse and then threw away. Subsequently, the woman described in detail the appearance of the suspicious person.

Design and development In 1935 the Soviet Navy begun working on larger MTBs that possessed higher endurance than the previous numerous G-5 class. The D-3 class was the most successful of the four designs considered, built in wood, and carrying torpedoes openly, in contrast with the smaller G-5 (being metallic and carrying torpedoes into troughs set of the rear deck). Production The production differentiated in two main series. 26 boats built between 1940 and 1941 possessed a noticeable lower speed (). 47 boats built between 1943 and 1945 could reach up thanks improved engines. =Variants= Of the other variants originally designed, the wooden D-2 and the steel SM-3 and SM-4, none saw mass-production even if the prototype of SM-3 saw active service during World War II in Black Sea. Service history In Baltic Sea the Finnish Navy captured the boat TK-52 in October 1941, after she was found grounded due a storm. She was named Vasema and used as motor torpedo boat until 1943 before operating as patrol vessel. She was returned to the Soviet Navy in 1944. The most notable naval Soviet success of the class was the participation at the Battle of Nerva Island where the Elbing-class large torpedo boat T-31 sunk. In Black Sea the D3 class never operated in large numbers, only the original D-3 prototype was active alongside the steel-built SM-3 prototype. Both vessels were however quite active, sinking the italian midget submarine CB-5 and the German barge F-334 in 1942 , while SM-3 sank another barge in 1944 alongside G-5 boats during the Crimean offensive.

The new building however would suit their requirements for the present\\". The council moved out of this building when the new York Town Hall and Chambers were completed in 1911.  Fire station  The property was advertised for sale in 1912 and acquired by William Thomas Davies, a member of the Municipal Council. At this time the property contained the main brick building of three rooms and back verandah with stables, harness room and toilet to the rear. The York Volunteer Fire Brigade that had been formed in 1910, moved into the building in October 1912. The Prunster family was instrumental in the relocation to the new premises, and also led a very successful football team.York Heritage Trail HCWA, 1988, p.1. Joseph Herman Prunster was an original member who later served as captain of the Fire Brigade for seven years. Initially the Fire Station was rented from Davies at a cost of 25 pence per week, before the building was purchased in 1914 by the WA Fire Brigades Board for ¬£700.Certificates of Title Vol 533 Fol 44; Vol 590 Fol 118 The Fire Brigade firstly erected a garage for their vehicle, which was built onto the former mayor‚Äôs office. They recessed into a horizontal rendered band the words \\"Fire Station\\" on the front of this extension, which can be seen clearly from Avon Terrace. The front room was converted to a bedroom, allowing the station to be manned at night. In 1921, a reel house was added to the north side of the building at a cost of ¬£150 to house the water hose cart. In 1928, the first motorised fire engine arrived, a T-model Ford referred to as \\"Motor 36\\". This in turn was replaced in 1941 by a new motor pump number 17, also a T-model Ford. This required enlargement of the engine room and the back wall was removed and extended back several feet, probably by volunteer labour. Subsequent fire engines were a Dodge in the late 1940s, an Austin in 1957 and a Bedford truck in 1972. A kitchen was added to the building by 1951 that included a Metters No 2 stove. The jarrah bell tower was replaced in 1952 and the fire bell replaced by a siren in 1955. This building served as the York Fire Station for 77 years.\\"Old York Fire Station Conservation Plan\\" prepared by Hocking Planning & Architecture, in association with Barbara Dundas, Historical Researcher, November 1998, pages 12-15; \\"York Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service 1910 - 2010: A Short History of the York Volunteer Fire Brigade\\", written on behalf of the York Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service, March 2010.  More recent uses  In 1989, because a new fire station had opened in York, the Fire Brigades Board decided to sell the property. The Shire of York agreed to purchase this building and entered into discussions with community groups regarding its future use. The building was transferred to the Municipality of the Shire of York in November 1989 for $8,588.73.Certificate of Title Vol 1857 Fol 766 A management committee was formed from community members.

Additional Lotteries Commission grants in 1993 and 1995 aided in further renovations.Heritage Council Assessment Documentation pp.4 and 5; York Chronicle, April 1997 Community groups using the centre over the years included the Toy Library, York Friendship Group, childcare groups and playgroups, pottery, theatre, yoga, senior citizens and rural youth groups. It was the meeting place for morning tea for the Friday shopping bus, and the office of the local newspaper. The building was sold by the Shire of York in January 2014 and purchased by the current owners in March 2015 as the home for Barclay Books.  Heritage listings  The National Trust of Australia (WA) classified the Old Fire Station on 5 March 1985 for architectural technical accomplishment, historical significance and environmental importance. The building was placed on the York Municipal Inventory in December 1995. The building was made a permanent entry in the State Register of Heritage Places on 11 December 1998.

It was designed and built by William Cox from 1814 to 1815 with the support of a convict road party. It is also known as Coxs Road and Old Bathurst Road. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 March 2015.  History  The road from Emu Ford to Bathurst, a distance of was completed in only six months during 1814 and 1815 by a working party composed mostly of convicts. Governor Lachlan Macquarie decided to have a carriage road constructed across the Blue Mountains, to the country which had been \\"newly discovered\\" by Europeans in 1813. The so called \\"First Crossing\\" of 1813 took place on the traditional lands of the Dharug, Gundungurra and Wiradjuri people. Other routes through the ridges and valleys of the Blue Mountains had been used by Aboriginal people for tens of thousands of years. Cox was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset in 1764. He married Rebecca Upjohn at Devizes, Wiltshire in 1789. Cox arrived in NSW on board the \\"Minerva\\" in January 1800. Cox became Chief Magistrate at Windsor in 1810 and in July 1814 Governor Macquarie made William Cox the Superintendent of the works for a new road over the Blue Mountains. His first wife died in 1819 and Cox married Anna Blachford in 1821. He died on 15 March 1837. The Cox's Road Fish River Descent Precinct is situated about south of Sodwalls. Cox selected a line towards the Fish River around 18 December 1814 after having previously ridden over the country west of Mount Blaxland. His Journal records:Whitaker, 2014: Chapter 4, William Cox's Journal, p 68 On 24 December Cox \\"went forward this afternoon to ascertain if I could get my caravan with safety to the Fish River\\", and gave orders \\"to strike tents and pack up in the morning\\". On 25 December (Christmas Day) he \\"went forward to the Fish River and removed our caravan and one cartload there, where I pitched my tent leaving behind 3 bridges to make and five miles of road.\\" As it was Christmas Day, Cox also issued the men in the road party with a gill of spirits each and a new shirt. By 29 December there were six men preparing material for the bridge across the Fish River, and the rest were presumably completing the road towards it. In early January the road party continued to draw and split logs and were building piers for the bridge which was finished on 5 January 1815. Cox described the Fish River bridge as follows:Whitaker, 2014: Chapter 4, William Cox's Journal, p 73 The Fish River area was another steep obstacle on the Bathurst Road which was commented upon by many for travellers who found the Fish River Hill ascent on the west side particularly difficult. In April 1817 botantist Allan Cunningham described the journey over the Clarence Hilly Range to the Fish River as \\"severe and oppressive to our horses, the whole being sharp lofty hills and narrow boggy valleys, alternately\\", but he also reported that alterations were being made to improve the gradient. Cunningham's Journal for 3 August 1817 described this section as follows:I. Lee, Early Explorers in Australia from the Log-Books and Journals, Including the Diary of Allan Cunningham, Botanist from 1 March 1817 to 19 November 1818, London, 1925, 12 April 1817 p 180; and 3 August 1817, page 301 On the west side of the Fish River the climb up the steep Fish River Hill (elevation ) was remarked upon by numerous travellers as difficult. In 1827 William Dumaresq called it \\"the worst hill from Sydney to Bathurst\\". He also noted that the old bridge had been washed away so it was necessary to ford the river and also mentioned that a convict road party was stationed there, presumably carrying out improvements to the Bathurst Road.  Description  Road through the hills William Cox had been instructed by Governor Macquarie only to open a rough cart road, so that the new lands found in the western plains would be symbolically open. The road from Emu Ford to Bathurst, a distance of was completed in only six months. Macquarie's instructions specified that the road should be at least wide in order that two carts would be able to pass each other, and that the timber should be cleared on each side so that the road corridor was wide. Stumps were to be grubbed out and any holes should be filled in. The surviving physical evidence shows relatively few locations where the extant road conforms with the dimensions specified in the instructions. Cut Hill Road, which is a part of the 1814 Cox's Road which has been resurfaced and upgraded as a local road, ends at Pitt's Corner where it joins Jerrys Meadows Road about south of Sodwalls. A reserved Crown Road identified as the Old Bathurst Road, continues west towards the Fish River and again, the general line is followed by a modern unsealed road which provides access to nearby farming properties. As with the preceding sections of the \\"Old Bathurst Road\\" there is more than one road line through this area. Three consecutive roads were identified by Karskens in 1988. Therefore, the actual Cox's road crosses in and out of private property. The earliest line is on the top of the ridge before dropping down to the river in a formation with shallow cuttings. Again the most obvious and substantial physical evidence in this area relates to much later 1820s lines and improvements, including long sections of walling which support an embanked road formation winding down the hillsides. Rocks mark the edge of the road The original line of Cox's Road followed the Crown Road now used as access to the farming properties \\"Clover Downs\\" and \\"Ambervale\\". It appears mainly as a widened, graded and cut road. From the \\"Ambervale\\" gate it appears to be less well used and in more original condition becoming a deeply eroded trench lined by trees left standing along the route to the river. At approximately east of the Fish River the road diverges; Cox' s road runs along the ridge as a faint unmade track, then descends steeply downhill. A later section of road, to the north, is cut along the side slopes and embanked to provide a road wide and of easier gradient. It is supported by an extensive convict-built retaining wall which winds down the mountainside to the river. The walling ranges between and in height. Construction is mainly un-coursed rubble work with the variation in the size of the stones used. It is very similar to the work on the zig-zag and other parts of the Mount Blaxland Precinct. It is likely that the convict road gang reported to be stationed at the Fish River in late 1826 may have been responsible for the extensive walling which supports the road that winds down the mountainside to the Fish River. There are no equivalent improvements on the western side of the river, and this may be explained by the fact that from 1827 onwards it was becoming evident that efforts would be made to find and build a completely new line of road to Bathurst. Between this substantial 1820s road and Cox's 1814 track there appears to be another road simply cut out of the hill on one side, with a flat surface. This may be the intermediate attempt to improve the road in 1817 as mentioned by Cunningham. According to McBrien' s survey in 1823, Cox's road continued south of the present reserved Crown Road down to the river. The line of timber follows the Crown road, there are shallow cuttings, and the indentation of the old road is still visible.Karskens, 1988, Fish River Precinct, p 95 ff. At Fish River, Cox built the second longest of his bridges which was completed on 5 January 1815. The Journal notes that the bridge was wide, and had a span with two \\"piers\\" filled with stone at either end, making a total length of . Only the Bluff Bridge at Linden was longer. Cox described the bridge as \\"a strong and well-built one\\" but also noted that \\"floods will go over it\\" and no trace of what must have been an impressive structure survives today. In 1988 Karskens also described the Fish River Crossing: \\"The banks of the Fish River show no trace of Cox\\" s bridge with stone-filled approaches. Severe floods washed away the structure and its successors. The banks today are covered with tussock grass and on the west with river stones and pebbles.Photo 130 There is a slightly raised mound of road-width on the eastern bank which may have been the approach to the ford.' West of the Fish River crossing the general line of Cox's Road is followed by an unsealed dirt road which winds back and forth to ascend the hill. There have clearly been some deviations and the modern road has obviously been re-cut and re-graded over time. The section west of the Fish River is not included in the Fish River Descent Precinct. The State Heritage Register listing of Cox's Road and Early Deviations includes six precincts of Cox's Road: *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Linden, Linden Precinct - HC Plan 2639 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Woodford, Old Bathurst Road Precinct - HC Plan 2640 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Woodford, Appian Way Precinct - HC Plan 2641 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Mount York , Cox's Pass Precinct - HC Plan 2642 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Hartley, Clarence Hilly Range / Mount Blaxland Precinct - HC Plan 2643 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Sodwalls, Fish River Descent Precinct - HC Plan 2644 = Condition = As at 1 December 2014, the road is substantially intact. Numerous features from the upgrading and realignment of Cox's Road in the 1820s are evident including road side retaining walls and cuttings. Within Lot 4, DP 1132182 evidence of another road formation cut into the slope of the hillside is also clearly visible. The road is substantially intact. Numerous features from the upgrading and realignment of Cox's Road in the 1820s are evident.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries show the route of the road As at 10 November 2014, the surviving remnants of Cox's Road, built 1814 to 1815, have state significance as the earliest road across the Blue Mountains and the first structure built by Europeans west of the Blue Mountains. Building of this road followed from the prior exploration by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth, and the survey by George Evans. The successful construction of the road was symbolic of the conquest of the natural barrier created by the Blue Mountains, and represented Governor Macquarie's vision for the ongoing development of the colony beyond Sydney and its immediate surrounds. Cox's Road enabled the later opening of the hinterland beyond the Blue Mountains for subsequent settlement, pastoral and agricultural expansion, which then escalated the dispossession of Aboriginal peoples from their lands. William Cox was well known among convicts for his power to recommend pardons and tickets of leave. Most of the convicts who volunteered for the work to open a track to the interior were emancipated, receiving Pardons or Tickets of Leave on completion of the work. The surviving road fabric demonstrates the crude and hurried nature of Cox's work, and the techniques used in tracing, cutting and forming the road. In conjunction with later colonial road alignments on the mountains and elsewhere, Cox's Road also forms part of a suite of roads demonstrating the wide range of road building styles and standards employed during the colonial period. Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Sodwalls, Fish River Descent Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 March 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state historical significance as physical evidence of the first road constructed across the Blue Mountains from Emu Plains to the Bathurst Plains (1814-15). Constructed in 1814-15 Cox's Road is one of the earliest Colonial-era road- lines surviving in Australia. The 1814 road is tangible evidence of the development of the colony at Sydney and of the expansion of white settlement into western NSW. The road symbolises the occupation of the country and Governor Macquarie's aspirations for the eventual opening of the interior to European settlement after the discovery of the Western plains by G. W. Evans in 1814. In this respect the 1814-1815 Cox's Road has considerable symbolic significance as an official public work which laid the foundations for future development. Cox's Road is linked with the foundation of Bathurst, the first inland settlement in NSW, which was proclaimed by Governor Macquarie on 7 May 1815 after his journey along the road. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state significance for their close association with Governor Lachlan Macquarie who commissioned the building of the road into the interior, and with the magistrate and ex-army officer Captain William Cox, who supervised the building of the road. The road is also associated with the convicts who laboured on the road to obtain their liberty, and with the officers and men who assisted Cox such as Thomas Hobby, Richard Lewis, John Tighe and Samuel Ayres. The crossing of the Blue Mountains, the surveying of a route to Bathurst and the building of Cox's Road were significant events in the period of Macquarie's governorship. Governor Macquarie's view of the importance of the road is demonstrated by his reports to Earl Bathurst, the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, and by his journey to the Bathurst Plains immediately after its construction, where he proclaimed the site for the Bathurst township. William Cox's achievement using a small group of convict men in a short period of time and with no loss of life caused by road-making or other substantial difficulties, was reflective of his reputation as a more humane employer and magistrate than many of his contemporaries. The leadership qualities, vision and skill he showed constructing the road would also be evident in later government contracts won by Cox for other public works. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The surviving precincts of Cox's Road have state technical significance for their ability to demonstrate simple, pre 1820s road building techniques. Improvement of the 1814 route throughout the 1820s also provide important evidence of later road building techniques and demonstrates the ongoing use of this key route to the interior, before it was superseded by the new Great Western Road laid out by Sir Thomas Mitchell in the 1830s. The Fish River Descent Precinct illustrates Cox's 1814-15 road and the way it was modified and improved, until it became superseded by new road lines after 1830. This precinct provides an excellent example of the progress made in road building between 1815 and , as three roads of progressively larger scale and sophistication still lie alongside one another. They illustrate the typical growth of a road from a rudimentary track to a \\"made \\" road , both in survey, location and construction. The original line of Cox's Road runs along the summit of the ridge, while less precipitous sections have been built on the slope below, the lowest of these with a long section of substantial convict-built retaining wall probably completed by a road gang stationed at Fish River in 1826. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cox's Road and its remnants are demonstrated as having social significance at a state level by the substantial interest in identifying and promoting Cox's Road for cultural tourism and education, and celebrating the bicentenary of the road by the general public, state and local government bodies and a range of community organisations. The road is of particular importance to Cox descendants. The William Cox Fellowship first nominated sections of Cox's Road for heritage listing in the 1980s. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Precincts of Cox's Road have research significance at a state level for their ability to demonstrate early nineteenth century road, culvert and bridge building techniques using basic skills and technologies. The remains of the 1814-15 road illustrate the conditions of the period and contribute to an understanding of the process of exploration and development, and of early colonial road building and road use. The remains represent a major physical, technological and engineering achievement and exhibit fine details of workmanship. Several precincts of the 1814-15 road have specific archaeological potential. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Surviving precincts of the 1814-1815 Cox's Road from Penrith to Bathurst are rare examples of early Colonial road building in NSW. The surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state significance as a rare example of pre 1820 road building based on the use of manual and primitive tools, and predating the more sophisticated road survey and construction techniques employed on the later \\"Great Roads\\" of the 1820s and 1830s.
