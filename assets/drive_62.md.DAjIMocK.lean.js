It was discovered on 30 December 1991, by Japanese astronomers Seiji Ueda and Hiroshi Kaneda at Kushiro Observatory () on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. It was named after Mexican astronomer Andr√©s Eloy Mart√≠nez.  Orbit and classification  Andr√©seloy is an attributed member of the Vesta family, one of the largest collisional populations of stony asteroids in the asteroid belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.1‚Äì2.4 AU (semi-major axis of 2.29 AU) once every 3 years and 6 months (1,267 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 7¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at Crimea‚ÄìNauchnij in 1987, extending the body's observation arc by 4 years prior to its official discovery observation at Kushiro.  Naming  This minor planet was named in honor of Andr√©s Eloy Mart√≠nez, Mexican astronomer and citizen scientist. He is known in his country for the adaptation of the novel The War of the Worlds. He likes to create scientific videos for the Internet. His main concerns are global warming and the impact of an asteroid on Earth. = Contest = The name was suggested by the Urania Astronomical Society () of Mexico. This society was a winner of the \\"NameExoWorlds\\" contest organised by International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2015, and was also awarded the naming right for this asteroid. In total, the naming of 17 minor planets such as 6117 Brevardastro was granted as an award to the contest's winners. The was approved by the IAU's Committee on Small Body Nomenclature and published by the Minor Planet Center on 12 February 2017 ().  Physical characteristics  Andr√©seloy has been characterized as a common S-type asteroid. = Rotation and poles = In March 2006, a rotational lightcurve of Andr√©seloy was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner at this Palmer Divide Observatory (), Colorado. Lightcurve analysis gave an average rotation period of 10.639 hours with a brightness variation of 0.78 magnitude (). Such a high brightness amplitude typically indicates that the body has a non-spheroidal shape. = Poles = In 2013, an international study modeled a lightcurve with a concurring period of 10.6590 hours and found a spin axis of (266.0¬∞, 67.0¬∞) and (62.0¬∞, 67.0¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates (Œª, Œ≤) (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Andr√©seloy measures 5.263 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a high albedo of 0.484.

It was formed in September ‚Äì October, 1941, and saw its first actions to the south of Stalingrad during the German siege of that city in the autumn of 1942. When the Soviet counteroffensive, Operation Uranus, began in November the 61st formed a significant part of the mobile forces of its 51st Army. After the positions of Romanian 4th Army were broken through the division took part in the exploitation to the southwest, but became overextended and vulnerable to the mobile German reinforcements arriving to attempt a breakthrough to their Sixth Army. The 61st suffered such severe losses that it had to be withdrawn to the reserves in December, and was later disbanded.  Formation  The 61st Cavalry Division began forming in September, 1941 in the Central Asia Military District. It was mostly recruited from men of several Central Asian nationalities. It received its first commanding officer, Colonel Nikolai Gadalin, on September 25. When formed, by the middle of the next month, its basic order of battle was as follows: * 213th Cavalry Regiment * 219th Cavalry Regiment * 222nd Cavalry Regiment * 13th Horse Artillery BattalionCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Sabers\\", Soviet Cavalry Corps, Divisions, and Brigades 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. V, 1995, p. 61 In November the division was assigned to 4th Cavalry Corps, and it would remain in that Corps as long as they both existed. The 3rd formation of this Corps had been serving in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran; following this its divisions were transferred to the occupation force while the headquarters and corps assets returned to Central Asia Military District. It was then assigned three new divisions: the 61st, 63rd and 81st Cavalry.Sharp, Red Sabers, p. 27http://tankfront.ru/ussr/kk/kk04.html. Retrieved June 11, 2017. In May, 1942, the division came under the command of Colonel Vasily Baumshtein, then, in June, was handed over to Colonel Anatolii Stavenkov, who would remain in command until the end of February, 1943. The division crossed the Caspian Sea by ship to Astrakhan. At Olya the ships were unloaded by barges. 4th Cavalry Corps, which by now consisted of only the 61st and 81st Divisions, was assigned to 51st Army in Southwestern Front, south of Stalingrad, in October, 1942. In orders issued by Gen. G.K. Zhukov on October 15 to the front commander, Gen. A.I. Yeryomenko, the latter was to: This attempt to relieve 62nd Army, along with several others in October and early November, had no success.  Operation Uranus  At the start of the decisive Soviet counteroffensive on November 19 the 61st was part of the 51st Army mobile group that exploited into the breakthrough of the Romanian Army lines towards the southwest. This mobile group had the 4th Mechanized Corps in the lead, with the 4th Cavalry Corps guarding its left flank. 4th Mechanized ran into trouble from Romanian guns and mechanical breakdowns, so the cavalry was unable to join the exploitation until 2200 hrs. on November 20. Once they did so, they followed in the wake of the tanks to Plodovitoe. At this point, the 61st diverged to liberate the town of Abganerovo, 18km southwest. The town fell to the 61st, assisted by elements of 4th Mechanized, on the following day, during which time the two cavalry divisions reportedly captured 5,000 Romanian troops between them. While the 81st moved southwest towards Aksai, the 61st was directed southward west of Lake Barmantsak to reach the rear of the Romanian 4th Infantry Division, which was holding up the advance of 91st Rifle Division on 51st Army's left wing. The Soviet cavalry was also anxiously awaiting the arrival of the 126th Rifle Division, which would be needed if the outer encirclement front was to have any holding power against the remnants of 4th Panzer Army and other German counterattack forces.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book One, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 262, 293. Note that throughout this book, Glantz mistakenly gives Col. Stavenkov's name as \\"Stavenko\\". On the 22nd, while en route to its next objective, the village of Korobkin, the 61st engaged elements of the Romanian 8th Cavalry Division in a battle near Kitov State Farm, 20km north of the village. Stavenkov's cavalrymen drove their Romanian counterparts back roughly 4km to the village of Vodianaia. The following day, the division was cooperating with the 91st and 302nd Rifle Divisions, plus two battalions of 76th Fortified Region, to liberate the town of Sadovoe, outflanking the Romanian 4th by capturing the Umantsevo region, 10km southwest of the town. The coordinated attacks by 61st Cavalry and 302nd Rifle Division forced the regiment of Romanian 8th Cavalry to withdraw 18km south of Aksai, leaving the bulk of its artillery behind.Glantz, Endgame, Book One, pp. 331-32, 365-66 The division took the town of Umantsevo on the 23rd, following which it was ordered to rejoin the 81st Cavalry and push southwards into the broad region between Aksai and Sadovaia, which were 45km apart. On November 24 the re-united 4th Cavalry Corps made the greatest advance of the forces of Stalingrad Front on that day, unhinging the meager Romanian defenses along the Aksai River, with 126th Rifle Division advancing gamely in the rear. Overnight on November 24-25, 4th Cavalry received orders from the Army commander, Maj. Gen. Nikolai Trufanov: This order required the cavalry, in tandem with 126th Rifle Division, to traverse 90 to 95km in three days and then capture an important rail center and road junction by attacking from three sides. Unknown to the Soviet command, on November 25 the remnants of 4th Panzer Army had been reorganized as Armeegruppe Hoth, incorporating the remnants of 4th Romanian Army, to buy time until mobile reinforcements could arrive by rail from the West and from Army Group A in the Caucasus.Glantz, Endgame, Book One, pp. 404, 407-08, 456-57 Within hours of departing Umantsevo on the 25th, 61st Cavalry encountered trouble. Upon reaching the village of Sharnutovskii, about halfway to Kotelnikovo, it ran into a counterattacked staged jointly by Battlegroup Korne, led by the commander of Romanian 8th Cavalry Division, and Battlegroup Pannwitz, an ad hoc group of renegade Cossack cavalry with infantry and armor support. The Soviet unit was particularly vulnerable because it had left its infantry support far behind; the 126th was concentrating 30km to the north, and the 302nd was 10km farther to the rear as both divisions prepared to advance on Kotelnikovo. After a fight that lasted until early the next morning and resulted in heavy losses,Glantz, Endgame, Book One, p. 585. The German/Romanian force claimed 500 prisoners, 10 antitank guns and a complete field artillery battery. the 61st was forced to withdraw back to Umantsevo, where it took up new defenses and licked its wounds. It likely remained there all day, at most sending out reconnaissance patrols. Meanwhile, 91st Rifle Division marched west to reinforce the troopers.Glantz, Endgame, Book One, pp. 457-59 81st Cavalry Division, with about 35 tanks from 85th Tank Brigade, attempted to take Kotelnikovo on the 27th. This force successfully drove off the Romanian garrison in panic, but was then counterattacked by Battlegroup Pannwitz and arriving elements of 6th Panzer Division. This raid on Kotelnikovo enabled the 61st to advance cautiously once again in the direction of Sharnutovskii. Over the following days, as the rifle divisions advanced, the outer encirclement front of 51st Army appeared strong, but the arrival of German armor exposed its weaknesses.Glantz, Endgame, Book One, pp. 459-60, 524 During Operation Winter Storm in December, the weakened division fought defensive actions at Verkhne-Kumski and Gromoslavka against panzers supported by airpower. On the open steppe, German air attacks caused heavy losses in men and horses. By the time the division was withdrawn into Southwestern Front reserves in February it had suffered over 65 percent losses. On March 1, the remnants of the division came under the command of Colonel V.A. Koninskii, who was concurrently commanding the 97th Cavalry Division, recently assigned to 4th Cavalry Corps. That division was disbanded on March 4, while efforts went on to rebuild the Corps, but in the event these efforts came to naught, and the 61st Cavalry Division was officially disbanded on May 20.Sharp, Red Sabers, p. 61 References * p. 359 External links *Anatolii Vasilevich Stavenkov 61 Military units and formations established in 1941 Military units and formations disestablished in 1943 ","title":"61st Cavalry Division (Soviet Union)"},{"id":"54281589","text":"Boison Wynney de Souza (born 27 December 1996), known as Boison Wynney or simply Boison, is a Spanish-born Liberian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for the Liberia national team.

In 1789 he opened and became principal of a female academy in Medford, Massachusetts which was the first Female Seminary in New England, where he worked for seven years. In 1799 he was president of an association for the improvement of common schools in Middletown, Connecticut. In November 1835, he took charge of a school for girls in Franklin, Connecticut. Over his lifetime, he authored textbooks on grammar and writing, and following his time at Exeter, contributed to the Annals of Education, a journal owned by his son. He also contributed to the Juvenile Rambler, a children's paper published in Boston, and wrote a book for children entitled The Dead Bird.

These designs have been incorporated into concept cars, starting with the car of the same name. The Nagare design lineup was intended as a showcase of what Mazda's cars may have looked like in 2020. It was abandoned in 2011 by Mazda in favour of the Kodo design series, starting with their Shinari concept car.  Motif and examples  The influence of the designs are wind and flow. These can be seen in the cars' design, where areas of the cars contain flowing lines. Production cars in Mazda's late-2000s lineup, such as the second-generation Mazda3 and Mazda6, could easily be identified by swooping leaf-shaped headlamps, while the third- generation Mazda Premacy had flowing lines sculpted into the bodywork. = Nomenclature = All concept vehicles have names in which represent Nagare's \\"wind and flow\\" theme in one way or another.  Concept cars  The Mazda Nagare, the first in the design series. The Mazda Ryuga, the second in the design series. Mazda Hakaze, the third in the design series. The Mazda Taiki, the fourth in the design series. The Mazda Furai, the fifth and final in the design series. It is also the most storied and most popular Nagare- designed car. = Mazda Nagare = The Mazda Nagare is the first car built under the Nagare design language, and shares the same name with the language itself. The car debuted in the 2006 LA Auto Show. The car takes the form of a long-wheelbase Kammback sports car. The futuristic interior is very irregular, with the driver placed front and center under the roof's highest point, and three additional passengers seated behind in a \\"wrap-around lounge\\". The Nagare also has butterfly doors that nearly span the entire wheelbase. The Nagare's engine is non-existent, as it is not a running prototype. Designer Franz von Holzhausen mentioned during an interview at Autoblog, that he took inspiration from nature and pasted it onto the Nagare concept. Some of von Holzhausen words are typed below: > \\"We began by studying motion and the effect it has on natural surroundings: > how wind shapes sand in the desert, how water moves across the ocean floor, > and the look of lava flowing down a mountainside. Natural motion registers > an impression in your brain and that's what we hoped to capture with the new > Nagare surface language. Once we started sketching our ideas, we weren't > surprised to find similar quests underway in other product design > disciplines. We found examples of motion influencing the shape and surface > of furniture, architecture, apparel, and artwork. Nagare undoubtedly proves > our confidence in identifying a new and exciting visual language for Mazda > as we lead the way in defining the interaction of motion and flow in > automobile surfacing.\\" = Mazda Ryuga = The Mazda Ryuga is the second vehicle built under the Nagare series. The name references the purpose of the design. The car features gull-wing doors, and an entirely futuristic interior, hinting at Mazda's planned future in design. It is powered by a 2.5-litre Mazda MZR inline-four engine. = Mazda Hakaze = The Mazda Hakaze is the third car to be featured in the series. The car has a crossover body style with scissor doors, which make front and rear access easy. However, HVAC and radio controls are difficult to access, making them user-unfriendly. The seats are very pod-like, suggesting that the seats may be hooked onto the center console. Mazda said the car was more production-ready than the rest of the lineup. It is powered by a 2.3-litre MZR engine. = Mazda Taiki = The Mazda Taiki is the fourth vehicle featured in the series. The name is intended to complement the car's atmospheric canopy surrounding the driver and passenger. The rear wheels are set out from the body. The car's interior continues the flowing design theme. Power from the Taiki comes from an improved version of the 13B Renesis Wankel engine used in the RX-8. = Mazda Furai = The Mazda Furai is the fifth and final car in the series. It is also the most storied and most popular Nagare- styled car. The Furai is based on the Courage C65 LMP2 prototype that Mazda used for the American Le Mans Series. The car runs on E100 ethanol, being the only rotary-powered car to do so. The engine is a midship-mounted R20B Renesis Wankel engine producing and coupled to a 6-speed Xtrac semi-automatic transmission. The engine was built by company Racing Beat, who also made the rotary-designed muffler. The name is also a reference to the Nagare \\"wind and flow\\" motif. The car wears the number 55 as a tribute to the Mazda 787B. The Furai was tested on many circuits, such as Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. In 2008, the car was destroyed after catching fire during a Top Gear photoshoot. This event was fully revealed to the public in 2013.

It is the sequel to Lucky's Tale, a virtual reality 3D platformer for the Oculus Rift. The game was released as a launch title for the Xbox One X on November 7, 2017. The game is featured as part of the Play Anywhere program. It was announced during the Xbox presentation at E3 2017. In March 2018, the game became part of Xbox Game Pass. An expanded version of the game titled New Super Lucky's Tale for Nintendo Switch was revealed on the Nintendo Direct live stream at E3 2019 on June 11, 2019 and released on November 8, 2019. This same version was eventually announced for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on August 21, 2020 with a surprise release on Microsoft Windows on the same date. Gameplay Super Lucky's Tale's gameplay has been described as reminiscent of 90's-era 3D platformers such as Banjo-Kazooie, Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64. Each of the game's five worlds is presented with its own hub, where each individual level can be accessed. The hubs are levels themselves, with coins to collect and some basic platforming required to reach new areas. Each hub has around five main levels, and a number of additional puzzles to complete. The goal of each of these levels is to collect clovers, which enable Lucky to take back control of the Book of Ages from Jinx. Each level has four clovers to find ‚Äî one for completing the level, one for collecting 300 coins, one for finding the five letters that spell \\"LUCKY\\", and one 'secret' clover, which is usually in a hidden area of the level, or by completing a short time challenge. The levels themselves offer a variety of platforming challenges. Some are 3D arenas with non-linear progression. Others feature 2D side- scrolling. There are also several mini-levels in each world, including Sokoban-style puzzles and mazes where Lucky is trapped in a marble and has to be guided to an exit. Finally, there are several boss fights featuring the Kitty Litter and Jinx. Plot Super Lucky‚Äôs Tale follows Lucky Swiftail, a curious and brave fox on a quest to find his inner strength and help his sister Lyra protect the Book of Ages, inside of which exist entire worlds and characters. The game's antagonist is a cat named Jinx, a mysterious villain who is trying to steal the Book of Ages for his own nefarious purposes. Along the way, Lucky encounters a supporting cast of friends and adversaries. Lucky must confront the Kitty Litter, Jinx's mischievous children. Lucky also meets friends and allies along the way, including misplaced Yetis, Kookie Spookies, a village of farming worms, and other colorful characters, all of whom live inside the Book of Ages and who, without Lucky's help, will fall prey to Jinx and the Kitty Litter's evil machinations. The plot in the Nintendo Switch port, New Super Lucky's Tale, is completely rewritten. Lucky's sister, brother, and parents belonging to the Guardian Order who exist to protect the Book of Ages. With Jinx having been a Guardian and close friend of Lucky's father only to turn evil after Jinx's world vanished, leaving Jinx and his children the lone survivors. Jinx soon then betrayed the other Guardians to claim the book for himself. Lyra and the surviving Guardians flee, avoiding the Kitty Litter for years until finally cornered. But the Book of Ages reacts to Jinx's magic by pulling the villains and Lucky into the book. Lucky collects the pages of the book to reopen the portals to the other worlds within the book as he faces off against the Kitty Litter, meeting friends along the way. When Lucky finally enters Jinx's Castle, he finds his sister Lyra, but this is revealed to be an illusion by Jinx, who steals the book from Lucky, revealing he'd let Lucky gather the pages for him, and now can rewrite history. After a grueling final boss, Lucky emerges victorious, and in the post-game levels, undertakes the trials to become a guardian, earning a final cut scene of Lucky being made a Guardian and a statue made in his honor. The cutscene then switches to Mittens jailbreaking Jinx and the rest Kitty Litter with help from Lucky's brother Lucas, who has fallen in love with Jinx's eldest daughter, Meowmalade. Development The character design of Lucky came about after numerous prototypes and concepts for animal characters, including a squirrel, a raccoon, and a lemur. Lucky was ultimately decided to be a fox, though his design would continue to receive tweaks before his final look was settled on. Mickey Mouse and Mario characters were cited as a key inspiration for Lucky‚Äôs design, as director Dan Hurd recalled they had a timeless look to them. The original Lucky‚Äôs Tale was developed as a VR experience for the Oculus Rift. When the development team received an opportunity to develop Super Lucky‚Äôs Tale for the Xbox One, they saw it as an opportunity to bring the Lucky franchise to a new audience. When the team set up a meeting with Nintendo with an early version of Super Lucky‚Äôs Tale running on the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo was very interested to see how a port would turn out. Microsoft, who originally published the game on Xbox One and Windows PC, were supportive of Playful‚Äôs choices realizing that a Nintendo Switch release would heighten franchise awareness. The game was one of the first Xbox One games to feature Dolby Atmos support.https://news.xbox.com/en- us/2017/11/13/xbox-one-x-windows-sonic-dolby-atmos-feature/ Reception The original version received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, while New Super Lucky's Tale received \\"generally positive\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Chris Carter from Destructoid gave the game a 7 out of 10 calling it \\"a clean, responsive platformer\\" and noted its controls are \\"an achievement given how sloppy some mechanics are in recent mascot platformers.\\" Kallie Plagge from GameSpot noted its limited camera controls are frustrating and added, \\"It's easy to imagine how Super Lucky's Tale would be the highlight of a younger kid's weekend, but it has little to offer anyone looking for an enjoyably challenging 3D platformer.\\" In his review for Nintendo Enthusiast, Brett Medlock concluded that \\"from beginning to end, New Super Lucky‚Äôs Tale is a much more streamlined experience than the original. Any qualms [with] the original game have been rectified in this re-imagined edition for Nintendo Switch. It‚Äôs a fun-filled experience that shouldn‚Äôt go unplayed by 3D platformer fans.\\" Chris Scullion from Nintendo Life summarized that New Super Lucky‚Äôs Tale is a \\"solid port of an underrated platformer with a greatly improved camera. It's a little on the short side and may not provide much of a challenge to more hardened gamers ‚Äì and if you already own it on Xbox One there really isn't enough 'new' here to warrant a second purchase ‚Äì but what makes it worth a look is its uncanny ability to make you smile, and this is something that can't be overlooked, especially in modern times.\\" References External links * 2017 video games 3D platform games Microsoft games Nintendo Switch games PlayStation 4 games Single-player video games Unity (game engine) games Video games developed in the United States Windows games Xbox One games Xbox One X enhanced games Xbox Play Anywhere games ","title":"Super Lucky's Tale"},{"id":"54281761","text":"Vilija () was a manufacturing company based in Vilnius. It was established in 1911 and produced agricultural iron tools such as ploughs and harrows. It was the first larger enterprise established in Vilnius by Lithuanians. The factory permanently ceased operations in July 1920. Background Engineer Petras Vilei≈°is established an ironwork workshop in 1900. It produced various industrial items (cisterns, caissons, parts for iron bridges, railroad switches, etc.) and smaller consumer products (fences, memorial crosses, lanterns, etc.). Majority of its business came from Russian government contracts. Its larger projects included the metal framework for the and the decorative elements for the Vilei≈°is Palace. It employed almost exclusively Lithuanian workers. It was located near the Vilnius Railway Station (present- day Paneriai Street) and had its own railway connection to transport the heavy products. In 1906, Jonas Basanaviƒçius lent 19,000 rubles to Vilei≈°is who offered his workshop as a security. Vilei≈°is faced financial difficulties and had to sell the workshop which became the basis of the Vilija factory. Operations The company was formally established on 29 April 1911 with a goal of providing agricultural tools to Lithuanian farmers. Its main shareholders at the time were Vilei≈°is, Basanaviƒçius, Jonas Smilgeviƒçius, printer Jurgis Pesys, and clerk Andrius Dubinskas. They offered shares to others and in the first three months attracted 36 investors that contributed 62,000 rubles of capital. Vilija continued to offer shares to new investors. When Basanaviƒçius visited United States in 1913, he not only collected donations for the Lithuanian Scientific Society but also sold shares of Vilija (he sold shares for $3,000 in Chicago alone). By early 1915, Vilija had 141 shareholderss and capital of 122,775 rubles. Starting in 1912, the factory was directed by Jonas Smilgeviƒçius and the company also sold imported goods (machinery, fertilizers, seeds). It had sales representatives in Kaunas, Panevƒó≈æys, Tel≈°iai, Utena, Joni≈°kis, Pikeliai. In 1913, it had 36 workers. Its profit for 1912 was 4,791 rubles and 6,684 rubles for the next 18 months. In 1912, Vilija's products won three silver medals at the agricultural exhibition in Rostov. Basanaviƒçius devoted substantial effort to the factory and its finances turning it into not only a profitable enterprise, but also one that strengthened the Lithuanian nation. It employed only Lithuanians and donated part of its profit to various Lithuanian societies, such as the Lithuanian Scientific Society, , and . He further envisioned a cooperative that would help improve and modernize Lithuanian agriculture. Disestablishment During World War I, the company produced iron hospital beds for the Red Cross and field kitchens for the Russian Imperial Army. In September 1915, Vilnius was taken over by the German Army and the factory was hastily evacuated to Smolensk. After the October Revolution, the factory was nationalized and later named after Mikhail Kalinin. The present-day KMD Factory of road machinery in Smolensk traces its roots to Vilija. The factory in Vilnius was revived in February 1919. At that time it had 12 employees and received an order for harrow-teeth and axes from the Commissariat of Agriculture of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. In May 1919, after Vilnius was captured by Poles, the Polish Army took away most of its inventory; the losses were calculated at 184,000 rubles. The factory was requisitioned for military aviation needs in January 1920 and the equipment was removed in July 1920 (just before the city fell to the Soviet Union). The factory was never reestablished though Vilija retained the ownership of the real estate.

Gameplay Gameplay of Throne of Fire, split-screened with the first player as Karag and the second as Cordrin. The second player is seen in combat against the King's Guard. Throne of Fire is an action strategy game. Set in the Burning Citadel, located around the rim of a volcano, the player assumes the role of one of the three princes of the recently deceased King Atherik: Alorn the Lion Prince, Cordrin the Sun Prince, and Karag the Wolf Prince. As one of the princes, the player can play against two computer players or a second player and a computer player, who play the role of the other two princes. Each prince and their men-at-arms must fight the other princes and their army to the death. The player must also fight against the King's Guard, the protectors of the Throne of Fire. Weapons with their own strengths and weaknesses can be found around the castle, along with magical objects that can increase or decrease a character's strength. Each army group are distinguished by color, with Prince Alorn and his men as red, Cordrin as yellow, Karag as purple, and the King's Guard as green. The castle has one hundred rooms to enter through. If any characters enters a room, their group color will light up the room. Each of the princes starts with nine men- at-arms. Reinforcements will join the side of whoever last visit Gate Rooms. If no one entered a Gate Room before the man-at-arms appears, they will join the King's Guard. Once the player enters the Throne Room with their prince, they become the king and takes control of the King's Guard. The other players lose the ability to control their men-at-arms, with their men staying in their rooms to defend themselves. If the new king dies, the King's Guard will return to being neutral and the other princes regain their men. Development Throne of Fire was designed by Mike Singleton, known for designing other fantasy games such as Lords of Midnight, Doomdark's Revenge, and Dark Sceptre. It was developed under Consult Computer Systems, who worked on the programming, graphics, and music and was published by Melbourne House. This was the first game Singleton made in association with Melbourne House. Jim Bagley was given the position of programmer for the game, the first game he ever worked on. The game was released in April 1987 on the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. A Commodore 64 port was also planned, but was never released. Reception Throne of Fire received mixed to positive reviews from video game critics, mostly for the ZX Spectrum version. Tim Metcalfe from Computer and Video Games said that Throne of Fire wouldn't be for everyone but recommended it to fans of strategy games who would find it to be an \\"absorbing challenge.\\" Tony from Your Sinclair praised its gameplay and its animation, describing it as \\"superb\\". ZX Computing Monthly also spoke positively of the game's graphics, though he also stated that it lacked the challenge when compared to Mike Singleton's The Lords of Midnight series. The Amstrad version of Throne of Fire was given a positive review by the German publication Aktueller Software Markt. Ben Stone, Paul Sumner, and Ricky Eddy from Crash were more critical on the gameplay, as they considered the game to be too easy to play in single player, with all three recommending the two player mode. Stone added that the lack of difficulty spoiled the gameplay. Eddy also criticized the game for lacking the compulsion and depth Mike Singleton's other games had. Judy Daniel from Sinclair User called the gameplay \\"dodgy\\" and thought it was not one of Singleton's best games. A reviewer for Computer Gamer was more negative towards the game. While saying that the game had interesting ideas in it, they did not think that the ideas worked together. Computer Gamer also called the action on screen confusing and considered the game to be \\"tedious\\" overall.

She received the Best Young French Economist Prize in 2015.  Biography  In 1999, Pascaline Dupas earned the equivalent of a B.A. in economics and econometrics from the prestigious grande √©cole √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris (rue d'Ulm), followed by a M.Sc. in economic analysis and policy in 2000 and a Ph.D. in economics in 2006 from the Paris School of Economics. Throughout her graduate studies, she held various visiting positions at MIT, Harvard University and New York University. Following her graduate studies, Dupas held assistant professorships at Dartmouth College (2006-2008), UCLA (2008-2011), and Stanford (2011-2014). She was promoted to associate professor with tenure in 2014.Pascaline Dupas' CV on her website at Stanford University. In addition to her work as researcher and teacher, she also worked as an (associate) editor for a variety of academic journals in economics, including the Review of Economic Studies, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Econometrica and the Journal of Development Economics.  Research  Pascaline Dupas' research studies the challenges that households and governments in developing countries face in relation to a broad range of issues in education, finance and especially health, the latter subject being one in which Dupas has particularly strong expertise.Dupas, P. (2011). Health Behavior in Developing Countries. Annual Review of Economics, 3, pp. 425-449. Methodologically, Dupas' research generally relies on the use of field experiments such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Core topics of her work include the prevention of diseases such as Malaria and HIV, the effect of teacher incentives, and the saving behaviour of poor people. Key findings of Dupas' research include the following: * Tracking not only benefits high- achieving students by raising the quality of their peers but also low- achieving ones by allowing teachers to adjust the level of instruction to the students' level of prior knowledge (with Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer).Duflo, E., Dupas, P., Kremer, M. (2011). Peer Effects, Teacher Incentives, and the Impact of Tracking: Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation in Kenya. American Economic Review, 101(5), pp. 1739-1774. * Women in developing countries face larger barriers to saving and investment than men and thus benefit strongly from the introduction of free formal saving services such as non-interest-bearing bank accounts (with Jonathan Robinson).Dupas, P., Robinson, J. (2013). Savings Constraints and Microenterprise Development: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Kenya. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 5(1), pp. 163-192. * Free provision of anti-malarial insecticide- treated nets (ITNs) is more effective than distribution under cost-sharing and, considering the large positive externality related to the widespread use of ITNs, would likely decrease the cost per life saved (with Jessica Cohen).Cohen, J., Dupas, P. (2010). Free Distribution or Cost-Sharing? Evidence from a Randomized Malaria Prevention Experiment. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 125(1), pp. 1-45. * Group savings and credit schemes as well as simply providing poor people with a safe place to keep money substantially increase health savings, though earmarking features were only effective for individuals who are frequently taxed by their social relations or for funds earmarked for emergencies (with Jonathan Robinson).Dupas, P., Robinson, J. (2013). Why Don't the Poor Save More? Evidence from Health Savings Experiments. American Economic Review, 103(4), pp. 1138-71. * Providing teenagers with information about the fact that the risk of HIV infection increases with the age of the sexual partner reduces teen pregnancies (and unprotected sex) more effectively than information focusing on abstinence.Dupas, P. (2011). Do Teenagers Respond to HIV Risk Information? Evidence from a Field Experiment in Kenya. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 3(1), pp. 1-34. * Providing schools in Kenya with contract teachers didn't increase the scores of students taught by civil service teachers, who reduced effort and attempted to usher the teaching contracts to relatives, but did increase the scores of students taught by contract teachers; a school governance programme giving parents more influence on hiring decisions through school committees reduced the capture by regular teachers (with Duflo and Kremer).Duflo, E., Dupas, P., Kremer, M. (2015). School governance, teacher incentives, and pupil-teacher ratios: Experimental evidence from Kenyan primary schools. Journal of Public Economics, 123, pp. 92-110. * Offering a one-time subsidy for an ITN in Kenya increases households' willingness to pay a year later by helping people learn about the benefits of the good and doesn't cause anchoring, thus suggesting an important role for short-run subsidies in promoting the long-run adoption of new health products.Dupas, P. (2014). Short-run subsidies and long-run adoption of new health products: evidence from a field experiment. Econometrica, 82(1), pp. 197-228. * Households' willingness to pay for a private water connection is high if it can be purchased on credit because it sustainably increases well-being by increasing leisure time and reducing inter- and intra-household conflicts related to water but not by improving health, stressing the relevance of households' access to credit (with Duflo, William Parient√©, Vincent Pons and Florencia Devoto).Devoto, F. et al. (2012). Happiness on tap: piped water adoption in urban Morocco. American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 4(4), pp. 58-99. * An abstinence-focused curriculum doesn't affect teen pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STIs), whereas education subsidies can be effective in reducing adolescent girls' dropout, pregnancy, and marriage but not STIs (with Duflo and Kremer).Duflo, E., Dupas, P., Kremer, M.

This novel was then selected by the West African Examination Council as one of the prescribed texts for prose in the English Language paper for the academic years 2004 to 2006 for the Basic Education Certificate Examination for junior high schools in Ghana. The respondent, in his action, claimed that, following a meeting of the Directors of the Ghana Education Service on the literature component of the Basic School English Language examination, it was decided that Junior Secondary School I pupils should be examined for prose in, the respondent's novel. A recommendation was therefore made that 450,000 copies of respondent's novel at a unit cost of 20,000 Cedis be ordered. The appellant, the publisher of a work titled Gateway to English for Junior Secondary Schools Pupil‚Äôs Book 3 included, as Appendix 6, a summary of the respondent's novel which caused the respondent to be aggrieved as the act of the appellant caused him to lose a substantial amount of money.Pearson v Adzei, Pg 3 Issue Whether or not there was copyright infringement by the publishers of Gateway. Rule Copyright protect does not extend to ideas, concepts, procedures, methods or other things of a similar nature.Section 2 of Copyright Act of Ghana, Act 690 Application It has been considered an axiom of copyright law, as applied in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and many other jurisdictions, that copyright protects the expression of an idea, rather than the idea itself. This at any rate is clear beyond all question, that there is no copyright in an idea, or in ideas. A person may have a brilliant idea for a story, or for a picture, or for a play, and one which appears to him to be original but if he communicates that idea to an author or an artist or a playwright, the production which is the result of the communication of the idea to the author or the artist or the playwright is the copyright of the person who has clothed the idea in form, whether by means of a picture, a play, or a book, and the owner of the idea has no rights in that product.Donoghue v Allied Newspapers Ltd.[1938]1ch.106 at p.109;Farewell Similarly, Copyright does not extend to ideas, or schemes, or systems or methods. It is confined to their expression and if their expression is not copied the copyright is not infringed.Hollinrake v Truswell [1894] 3 ch. 420 at p. 424, Lord Justice Lindley Ghanaian law, as usual, has been influenced by this English law. Accordingly, the appellant has endeavoured to construct a case based on this axiom of English and Ghanaian law.Pearson Education limited v Morgan, Adzei, JSC Date Baah Submissions Both parties offered compelling arguments with respect to the extent of Copyright application in Ghana. =Applicant's Submission= The appellant submits that the judgment of the trial court failed to address the import of the provision in section 2 of Act 690 that copyright does not extend to ideas, and that the Court of Appeal erred in not setting aside the judgment on that ground. The plot of a novel, such as Woes, was an idea that had no copyright protection under Act 690. Therefore, the Summary could not constitute copyright infringement especially when it was neither alleged nor established that the Summary had plagiarized the plaintiff's linguistic style or presentation. The appellant argues that the Summary, published purposely for education, did not infringe the plaintiff's copyright in Woes.Appellant‚Äôs statement of case The appellant goes on to cite in support of his argument, ideas versus expression. In dealing with the question of copying, there should be borne in mind the well established principle that there is no copyright in mere ideas, concepts, schemes, systems or methods. Rather, the object of copyright is to prevent the copying of the particular form of expression in which these things are conveyed. If the expression is not copied, copyright is not infringed. Thus to be liable, the defendant must have made a substantial use of the form of expression; he is not liable if he has taken from the work the essential idea, for his own purposes. Protection of this kind can only be obtained, if at all, under patent law or the law relating to confidential information. This principle finds expression in many of the cases, to the effect, for example, that it is no infringement of the copyright on a literary or dramatic work to take its basic idea or plot...‚Äù Copinger and Skone James on Copyright vol.1 15th ed Pg 371-372 par 7-13ff =Respondent's Submission= The Summary was a substantial reproduction of Woes, particularized as general similarity of the plot characterization and incidents in the two works and upon the similarity or identity of the words and phrases. The main issue that fell for decision was whether Gateway merely summarized the plot of Woes or, whether in doing so, it plagiarized the literary presentation in Woes. Obviously the plaintiff did not establish the alleged similarity or identity of the words and phrases‚Äù because there was none. The grievance of general similarity of the plot characterization and incidents in the two works‚Äù also overlooked the position that there is no copyright in ideas.Par. 4 and 5 of the amended statement of claim p 19 No copyright in ideas. \\"Copyright is a property right. But copyright is concerned, in essence, with the negative right of preventing the copying of material. It is not concerned with the reproduction of ideas but with the reproduction of the form in which ideas are expressed. ‚ÄúIdeas, it has always been admitted‚Ä¶are free as air. Copyright is not a monopoly, unlike patents and registered designs, which are‚Ä¶The position is that, if the idea embodied in the plaintiff‚Äôs work is sufficiently general, the mere taking of that idea will not infringe. If, however, the idea is worked out in some detail in the plaintiff‚Äôs work and the defendant reproduces the expression of that idea, then there may be an infringement‚Äù.Copinger and Skone James on copyright,vol.1 15th ed. P.26 par.2-06 Holding # What was replicated in the Summary was only the general idea of the novel, which in terms of section 2 of the Act is excluded from copyright protection. # The Court of Appeal was in error in failing to advert to this question of law. # This appeal succeeds and the judgments of the courts below should be set aside. Judgement Since section 2 of the Copyright Act, has specifically excluded ideas, concepts among others from Copyright, the fundamental and core issue which a court engaged in a copyright case has to consider is whether the works alleged to be in breach of the Copyright Act, are not excepted under section 2 of the Act. Since the plaintiff has failed to clear that initial hurdle, the appeal herein succeeds.Pearson v Morgan, JSC Jones Dotse References Ghanaian law ","title":"Pearson Education Limited v Morgan Adzei"},{"id":"54281953","text":"Bhichai Rattakul (, , ; born 16 September 1924) is a senior Thai politician who served as the Deputy Prime Minister between 1983-1990 and 1997‚Äì2000, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the National Assembly, the leader of the Democrat Party between 1982-1991, and the World President of Rotary International between 2002-2003.

The vehicle was originally intended to be a self propelled assault gun, and was developed as such, but part way through development it was realised that with the anti aircraft usefulness of the 8.8 cm gun, it could also be used in the role of a Anti- Aircraft vehicle. In late 1942, there were 3 prototypes made.

It was 2.8 metres high, 3 metres wide and 7 metres long. It was powered by the Maybach HL90 engine. The turret was open, with the sidewalls coming down on each side to make a platform. However, with them raised, it would provide some protection for the crew. The crew were also protected from the front by a shield for the gun. \\"Pzsfl-ivc\\" http://mirtankov.su/tank/obzor-pzsfl-ivc.

One Hundred Sycamore displays common elements of the Art Deco style.  Physical Characteristics  Built in 1929, the building exhibits character-defining features of Art Deco architecture including smooth surfaces with windows arranged in sunken vertical panels, flat roofs with parapets, and zigzag ornamentation, as evidenced by the attached photo exhibit. Historic building materials and character-defining design elements are generally extant. From Charles J. Fisher's petition for implementation as a building of Historical Significance: This brick and stucco apartment building is an excellent intact example of the Art Deco style that was built in Los Angeles during the late 1920s thru the beginning of WWII. The structure exhibits a high degree of integrity both interior and exterior. The original owner Charles R. Miller appears to have been a local developer. He is listed as the contractor on the permit, even though the Arthur C. Wright Company was a design-build firm. Arthur C. Wright had a construction business in Southern California from 1922 until his death in 1977. The One Hundred North Sycamore Building displays a high degree of integrity in its design and is a fine well maintained building that gives a solid reference to its time and place. Although most previous owners do not seem historically significant, one exception is Sonia Suk, who was on title from 1970 until 1997. Suk was one of the main founders of the Korea Town community in Los Angeles and for many years held a prominent position in the local Korean American business community. It was during Suk's ownership that the building was brought up to code on both Section 88 Seismic Requirements and the Dorothy Mae Fire Requirements. The work was done in such a manner that it retained the architectural integrity of the building.

At the conservatory in Montpellier, she studied musicology, voice and piano. Whilst at Montpellier, in 2008, she appeared in the Montpellier Opera production of Manfred, which at the instigation of the director Ren√© Koering was followed by concerts around the region. She attained greater recognition with a concert performance as Isabella Linton in a Festival de Radio France presentation, in Montpellier, of Bernard Herrmann's opera Wuthering Heights, in which she also impressed the critics by playing the piano on stage. In 2010, rather than write her musicology thesis in Montpellier, Crebassa joined the Young Artist Program (studio) of the Op√©ra National de Paris, singing leading roles in the studio productions and supporting parts in main Op√©ra productions of Lulu, Rigoletto and Madama Butterfly. In 2012, she made her Salzburg Festival debut in a concert performance of Handel's Tamerlano, as Irene, which she swiftly repeated in a stage production at La Scala updated to early 20th century Russia. In 2014, she returned to the Salzburg Festival as one of the title role performers in Charlotte Salomon by Marc-Andr√© Dalbavie. Having sung Orph√©e in the Berlioz version at the Op√©ra studio in 2011, she reprised the part at the Op√©ra-Comique in 2018. In February 2017 for the Op√©ra Comique, she appeared in the title role of the company's production of Fantasio by Jacques Offenbach at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet.

Her considerable Mozart work has included Cecilio in Lucio Silla (in Salzburg and Milan), Sesto in La clemenza di Tito (Salzburg and Paris), Cherubino in Le nozze di Figaro (Berlin, Vienna, New York, Amsterdam) and Dorabella in Cos√¨ fan tutte (Chicago). Crebassa made her USA debut in May 2015 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Her stage debut in the USA was with Lyric Opera of Chicago in February 2016, in Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette as Stephano. In August 2017, she made her debut at The Proms singing Sh√©h√©razade by Ravel. She added M√©lisande to her repertoire in 2018 in Berlin; originally at the instigation of Daniel Barenboim, she said that she felt she had \\"sung it my whole life\\" and found new colours in her voice and relishing the text.

It stars Amey Wagh and Mithila Palkar. It is directed by a debutant director, Varun Narvekar. The film also features Sachin Khedekar and Chinmayi Sumit in supporting roles..The film portrays the efforts of the parents to fill the generation gap. It is available on Netflix and Sony LIV. Plot Alok (Amey Wagh) and Indu (Mithila Palkar) have been dating for three years. Indu works as an executive in an ad agency and is focused on her career. Alok, despite holding a gold medal in the Masters in Business Administration degree works as a substitute accounts teacher at a coaching class. At a party where Indu isn't present, Alok and she break up over the phone. Alok's parents (Sachin Khedekar & Chinmayi Sumit) who are aware and accepting of their relationship, want them to get engaged next year. When Alok informs them of the break-up, they are disturbed and attempt to get him to talk about it, despite his protests. In flashbacks we see Alok feel insecure and jealous when Indu talks of moving to Kerala for a year, befriends male co-workers and is unable to give Alok time and attention because of her job. Alok justifies the break-up by explaining to his parents Indu's changed behaviour, her partying and drinking habits and is firm on not wanting to get back together. His father however, wants to hear Indu's side of the story too. He tricks Alok and his mother into going out to lunch, but also invites Indu, who agrees out of respect towards Alok's parents. In the restaurant things turn awkward when Alok's father gets Indu and Alok to mention each other's best qualities, with Alok saying that Indu is better than him in every way. Later in private, Indu confronts Alok about telling his parents about their break-up and her drinking. She asks Alok why he isn't able to find a steady job, or why he chooses to do random jobs despite having been a gold medallist at college. She leaves abruptly, calling later to apologise to Alok's parents. As they head back home, we see flashbacks to Alok and Indu's last fight, where Indu confronts Alok about not showing up for interviews or leaving jobs half-way. She tells him she has read his emails in an attempt to understand Alok's behaviour and knows that Alok lied to them about why he quit his year-long internship in Boston. She asks him what he's afraid of. Alok, upset and angry at Indu for reading his emails asks her to get out of his house. In the present day, Alok's parents are preparing for guests to arrive. Alok has completely forgotten that it's his parents' anniversary. When he goes upstairs to fetch his father, Alok catches him listening to an old recording of him talking about Indu. Alok wants to know why his father has been taking Indu's side. Alok's father explains to him that he had seen Alok struggle with fear of failure after his MBA, but was certain that Indu would help him get through it. He explains to Alok that Indu has simply been trying to get Alok out of his comfort zone, but Alok never gave her a chance. Alok realises his mistake and rushes to Indu's house and apologises for the way he treated her. Indu forgives him. The movie ends with Alok and Indu celebrating Alok's parents' anniversary.

Dr. Louie's research aims to mediate these transitions via metal catalyzed reactions, mainly involving nickel catalysis. Dr. Louie and her team focuses on nickel-based systems not only because it is much less expensive than the more widely used palladium and platinum, but also because it offers a wider range of chemical activity, such as nickel, being a more electropositive transition metal which allows it to undergo oxidative addition readily; oxidize Nickel and lessens the electron density around the atom itself.6 This allows for the cross-coupling of electrophiles to occur which is pivotal in the formation of carbocycles and heterocycles.Thakur, Ashish, and Janis Louie. \\"Advances in Nickel-Catalyzed Cycloaddition Reactions To Construct Carbocycles and Heterocycles.\\" Accounts of Chemical Research 48.8 (2015): 2354-365. Web. Dr. Loui and her colleagues further enhance the catalytic ability by combining nickel with N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands. The NHC ligands are largely sterically hindered and electron donating, which allows improved and less harsh reactions conditions by expanding the chemical scope of the substrate. (Taking all these chemical factors into account, the Ni/NHC catalyst can effectively couple diynes and nitriles to create pyridines using a hetero-oxidative coupling mechanism. Also, this nickel catalysis method (Figure 1) offers a wider range of substrates for which nickel can perform cyclo-additions on, substrates such as; vinylcyclopropanes, aldehydes, ketones, tropones, 3-azetidinones, and 3-oxetanones). Louie is also involved in the study and research of diversifying organometallic catalysts. Usually, an organometallic catalyst is only used for one specific type of reaction, but Louie has been Figure 2: Formation of 2-pyrones working on the development of these organometallic catalysts as to make them able to catalyze more than one specific type of reaction.Louie, Janis, Christopher Bielawski, and Robert Grubbs. \\"Tandem Catalysis: The Sequential Mediation of Olefin Metathesis, Hydrogenation, and Hydrogen Transfer with Single-Component Ru Complexes.\\" Journal of the American Chemical Society 123.45 (2001): 11312-1313.

The World Bank has supported projects in Uzbekistan in the areas of education, infrastructure, agriculture, and water resource management. Uzbekistan's collaboration with the bank has been increasing, with IBRD and IDA lending reaching a recent peak of $500 million in 2015. The World Bank has provided financing for 27 projects through the IBRD and IDA in throughout its relationship with Uzbekistan, with 15 active projects as of June 2017. Current IBRD and IDA projects total $1.9 billion.  World Bank Strategy in Uzbekistan  Uzbekistan export map for 2012. The Uzbekistan economy is currently in a period of sustained economic growth since 2002, with GDP growing 7.8% in 2016. The World Bank attributes growth in 2016 to expansions in services, agriculture and the service sectors. Cotton is a major commodity comprising 14.2% of total exports in 2015, down from more than 20% in 2012. The World Bank's Systematic Country Diagnostic report released in 2016 identifies 10 constraints that limit the economic potential of Uzbekistan. Among these are low accountability and regional inequality in the public sector, infrastructure bottlenecks, regulatory barriers, inefficient land allocation in the agricultural sector, limited access to pre-primary and tertiary education, and unsustainable use of natural resources. Taking into account the constraints listed in the SCD, the World Bank Country Partnership Framework for 2016-2020 highlights three Focus Areas to support the government's objective of achieving upper-middle income status by 2030. The focuses are private sector growth, agricultural competitiveness and cotton sector modernization, and public service delivery.  Notable Completed Projects  = Energy Infrastructure = The Talimarjan Transmission Project financed the construction of high voltage transmission lines in the southern Bukhara and Qashqadaryo regions of Uzbekistan and an open switch yard for the Talimarjan Thermal Power Plant. The project, closed on June 30, 2011, was designed to reduce transmission losses and improve service reliability for the region. Additionally, the project provided the increased transmission capacity necessary for two new combined cycle generators at the Talimarjan plant financed by the Asian Development Bank, JICA, and local investments. The project resulted in increased power reliability for 4 million people in the project area, with frequency of interruption down, electrical outages reduced from 92 to 24 hours per year, and voltage variation reduced to 5%. = Healthcare = A series of projects aimed at improving access and quality of rural healthcare have been supported by the World Bank in conjunction with the government of Uzbekistan. The First Health Project resulted in the establishment or rehabilitation of 682 primary care centers in rural Uzbekistan, with 673 receiving updated medical equipment. Ten month training courses in family medicine were provided to 898 doctors. The follow-up project, Second Health Project, resulted in upgraded equipment for 2,389 rural clinics and additional 10-month training courses for 3,770 general practitioners. Additionally, the project increased prenatal care coverage, newborn hepatitis B immunization, primary care utilization per capita, and essential drug stocks at the primary care level. The third project in the series, Health System Improvement Project, is currently underway with a greater emphasis on the larger district hospitals. = Education = Students in Samarkand The two phase Basic Education project aimed to improve the quality of general education in Uzbekistan by providing teachers with better materials, implementing standardized tests, and improving educational budget practices. Phase 1 targeted preschools and secondary education in 7 out of Uzbekistan's 12 oblasts. The project was completed in February 2011 and resulted in 80% of targeted schools receiving improved materials, effecting 1,501 secondary schools and 598 preschools. The project also provided training for 3,000 teachers, principals, and methodological in new teaching methods and software applications. A new financing formula for schools budgets was implemented with input from the Ministry of Public Education and the Ministry of Finance. Phase 2, completed in March 2014, continued the progress of phase 1 and expanded the targeted number of secondary schools to 2,198 from 1,501. Training was given to 59,147 teachers on student-centered teaching approaches. School improvement grants were administered to 500 school boards. The IEG ICR Review for the project determined that improvements to teaching were substantial due to the adoption of new materials and training while improvements to learning and student performance were modest based on standardized math and reading test scores from Grade 4 students. The Bank notes the difficulty in developing appropriate project timelines for education and how to accurately measure results for relatively short term projects.  Controversy  = Forced Labor in the Uzbekistan Cotton Harvest = A laborer picking cotton in the Tashkent region of Uzbekistan. The cotton industry is a major component of Uzbekistan's economy and remains in state control. Instances of the use of forced and child labor have been documented in the annual cotton harvest. A complaint was filed on June 30, 2016 against the IFC of the World Bank Group by an alleged forced laborer as well as three Uzbek human rights defenders. The complaint against IFC project number 36098 was filed anonymously in fear of retaliation. The complaint asserts that the IFC had not fulfilled its due diligence responsibilities in approving a loan in the amount of $40 million to Indorama Kokand Textile (IKT), a joint venture between the National Bank of Uzbekistan and Indorama Corporation. The loan was approved in spite of an IFC Environmental and Social Review Summary, referenced in the complaint, finding that the IKT had limited ability in ensuring that its supply chain remain free of forced labor. The IFC response to the complaint as well as the Environmental and Social Review Summary on IKT appear to be publicly unavailable, as references to IFC project 36098 have been removed from the IFC website. The World Bank acknowledges the history of forced and child labor in Uzbek cotton and current projects aim to eliminate its use. The IFC project Sustainable Cotton Supply Chain Development in Uzbekistan aims to work with the government of Uzbekistan to establish a sustainable cotton production system. The new system is being developed in accordance with standards from the Better Cotton Initiative and will introduce market incentives to discourage the use of forced labor. The project began in February 2017 and is projected to run through December 2022.

Thompson is a Californian chemistry academic who has worked with OLEDs.  Career  Mark E. Thompson graduated with honors from the University of California, Berkeley earning his B.S. in chemistry in 1980. He earned a Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry working under the guidance of Prof. John E. Bercaw. He conducted research at a Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (S.E.R.C.) as a Research Fellow in an Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory at Oxford University. There, Thompson worked with Prof. Malcolm L. H. Green investigating specific properties of organometallic materials. Following his S.E.R.C. Fellowship, Thompson became an assistant professor at Princeton University in 1987. He moved to the University of Southern California in 1995 where he currently holds a Ray R. Irani Chair of Chemistry. From 2005-2008, Thompson served as the Chemistry Department Chairman at USC.  Research  Thompson's multidisciplinary research focuses on solving problems related to energy inefficiency of existing light-generating sources. His research is primarily focused on organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics and device interfaces. thumb Thompson's research on OLEDs addresses problems such as the mechanism of electroluminescence, the identification of new materials and device architectures for OLEDs. His work in OLEDs is part of a long-term collaboration with Prof. Stephen Forrest (University of Michigan), dating back to 1994. The Thompson Group were the first to report efficient electro- phosphorescence in OLEDs, which shifts the effieincy limit of OLEDs from 25% to 100%.[Highly Efficient Phosphorescent Emission from Organic Electroluminescent Devices.

His laboratory discovered and developed a class of Ir(III)-based complexes featuring polyaromatic ligands, which can be efficiently tuned for color emission and excited-state lifetimes. These materials can be doped in the emissive layer of multilayer, vapor- deposited OLEDs and generally show high stabilities and efficiencies. Emitters form this family of materials were developed by the Universal Display Corporation and can be found in a wide range of commercial electronic displays, including the Galaxy mobile phone form Samsung and OLED-based televisions form LG.

His results represent an advance in blue- emitting phosphorescent OLED architectures and materials combinations. Additionally, Thompson has shown a very high-efficiency OLED approaching 100% internal quantum efficiency. The high internal phosphorescence efficiency and charge balance in the structure are responsible for the high efficiency. He also developed a new white OLED architecture that uses a fluorescent emitting dopant to harness all high energy singlet excitons for blue emission, and phosphorescent dopants to harvest lower-energy triplet excitons for green and red emission. As of now, Thompson currently holds over 200 patents in OLED materials and devices. Another focus of his is on organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Thompson's research highlights recent progress in explaining molecular characteristics which result in photovoltage losses in heterojunction organic photovoltaics. In addition to this research, Thompson grows thin films to control their structure. Then with these films, he can study the nature of energy and charge propagation. He has done work on thin films made of zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) which are used to prepare Organic solar cells.Chemical Annealing of Zinc Tetraphenylporphyrin Films: Effects on Film Morphology and Organic Photovoltaic Performance.

He has worked with singlet fission materials that promise to give markedly improved efficiencies for OPVs by current multiplication. Singlet fission involves the splitting of a singlet exciton into two triplet excitons, so a single photon can lead to two hole/electron pairs in a photovoltaic cell. His work has led to tetracene based materials that give high triplet yield from amorphous thin films.Singlet Fission in a Covalently Linked Cofacial Alkynyltetracene Dimer. Nadezhda V.

The research focuses on smart materials that can respond to different environmental factors to produce technologies that produce desirable results. Such materials can be sensitive to magnetic fields, pH, light, stress, voltage, temperature, etc. For instance, an implantable, resonant mass sensor was created (built on a probe with a piezoelectric thin film) for liquid mass sensing. Thompson has demonstrated a selective functionalization of a range of In2O3 nanowire devices by electrochemically activating their surfaces and then immobilizing bio-recognition agents such as single-strand DNA or antibodies. This has the potential to be used in large- scale biosensor arrays or chips for inexpensive multiplexed detection.

It is a continuation of Diary of an Oxygen Thief (2006).  Summary  Chameleon in a Candy Store picks up where Diary of an Oxygen Thief left off. The narrator is now in an exclusive relationship with the French girl mentioned at the end of the previous book. At her insistence he begins seeing a therapist. It looks like he might be about to settle down and get married until the very act of going to therapy opens him up to other options. When he discovers online dating he begins to realize that selling products is not that much different from seducing girls and so he harnesses his advertising skills to do exactly that. After breaking up with the French girl and ending the therapy sessions he embarks on a sexual adventure encountering all manner of women online. As he continues to date these women the need to promote his book becomes more and more urgent until he starts to combine online-dating with book-promotion. This culminates in him creating a fictional dating profile of a beautiful girl who cites Diary Of An Oxygen Thief as her favorite book. Book-sales soar since men will do anything to get a date with this fictional beauty. We are left with the feeling that the narrator will create all sorts of \\"covertising\\" and that we should henceforth be wary in all our online dealings. http://deadline.com/2016/05/diary-of-an-oxygen-thief-anonymous-author-gotham- group-self-publishing-phenomenon-1201748378/ http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Chameleon-in-a-Candy- Store/Anonymous/The-Oxygen-Thief-Diaries/9781501169793 https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and- marketing/article/70874-how-diary-of-an-oxygen-thief-went-from-self-published- obscurity-to-bestsellerdom.html  References  2014 novels Self-published books English-language novels ","title":"Chameleon in a Candy Store"},{"id":"54282612","text":"Elias bin Sulaiman (born 29 April 1986) is a Malaysian professional football player who plays as a midfielder for Sabah in the Malaysia Premier League.

He was the music director of the Orchestre national des Pays de la Loire from 1976 to 1994, and from 1995 to 2003 GMD of the Beethoven Orchester Bonn which plays in both opera and concert. He has worked at major opera houses in Europe and made several recordings, such as Leonore, Beethoven's first version of Fidelio, the piano concertos and symphonies by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, Honegger's Jeanne d'Arc au b√ªcher, and Penderecki's St Luke Passion.  Career  Born in Lyon, Soustrot first studied there at the Conservatoire de Lyon from 1962 to 1969.Alain P√¢ris: Dictionnaire des interpr√®tes et de l'interpr√©tation musicale au XX si√®cle. Robert Laffont, Paris, 1995 (p.890). He continued his studies at the Conservatoire de Paris, in particular in piano, trombone, chamber music, and conducting (under Rosenthal and Tzipine). In 1974 he won first prize in the international conducting competition in London, which led to becoming assistant conductor to Andr√© Previn at the London Symphony Orchestra, and in the following year succeeded Jean-Claude Casadesus as assistant conductor of the Orchestre national des Pays de la Loire of which he became music director from 1976 to 1994. Soustrot resigned as director of the Op√©ra de Nantes in 1989 in protest at a 50% reduction in its state subsidy following a change of government in Nantes after local elections, also accusing the French government of diverting money from provincial companies to the Op√©ra Bastille.In the News.

In a run of Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann in Geneva, one critic wrote \\"The Orchestre de la Suisse Romande sparkled under Marc Soustrot, [...] Soustrot's light touch and dramatic punch gave the evening an atmosphere of momentum and musical brilliance, and helped one to forget the stylistic imbalances in the music.Andrew Clark. Switzerland: Layers within layers. Opera, Vol.41 No.9, September 1990, p1111-1114. For his conducting of Berg's Wozzeck, he was described as \\"an impressive conductor, avoiding anything artificial but aiming for what Berg had in mind: a sensual effect of magnificent sounds.\\"Carl H Hiller. Report from Bonn. Opera, Vol.50 No.5, May 1990, p579-580. He conducted in 2017 at the Oper Frankfurt a double bill of Debussy's cantata La Damoiselle √©lue and Honegger's dramatic oratorio Jeanne d'Arc au b√ªcher, again staged by Oll√©, and co-produced with the Teatro Real Madrid.

His work centers around ideas of gender, communication, and consciousness, and his practice includes social relationships and digital technologies. He gained attention as a member of the avant-drag collective Chez Deep 2012‚Äì2014 performing in New York City, Miami, and Glasgow with members Alexis Penney, Bailey Stiles, Hari Nef, and Sam Banks. He is a member of the electronic music trio Holly Herndon, which supported Radiohead on their 2016 European tour. Biography Self was born in Aloha, Oregon. He studied puppetry and experimental writing at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington from 2006 to 2008. He transferred to the School of Art Institute of Chicago and completed his BFA in 2010. Soon after, Self relocated to New York where he began performing regularly as a solo artist and in groups like Chez Deep, 2 Pretty, and the #HDBoyz. Self started a monthly alternative queer party Clump, which raised money for a biannual microgrant the Radical Diva Grant and which featured DJs, performances, and readings, with artists like Umfang, Mykki Blanco, and Andrea Crespo. Since 2014, Self has performed as part of an electronic music trio with Holly Herndon. He graduated from Bard College's Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts in Hudson, New York studying music and sound in 2017. In 2018, Self premiered Siblings (Elation VI), the final opera of \\"The Elation Series\\" at MoMA PS1 which corresponded with the release of Siblings on RVNG Intl. in November 2018. Work Self's work reflects in different ways the themes of community, kinship, and caring. Self co-wrote the experimental opera The Fool with artist Raul de Nieves, which premiered at ISSUE Project Room in 2014 and restaged at The Kitchen in 2017 with a chorus of 22 voices. The project grew out of a community choir Self had been hosting in his home which invited anyone to come sing, motivated by the idea that the voice can be a tool to incite social transformation. He often frames his work as a form of activism, responding to social crises and systems of control. He was one of several choreographers who collaborated to create the 150-person immersive performance Authority Figure at the Knockdown Center in Queens, New York in 2016, a work which thematized obedience, surveillance and policing. Self's experimental theatre work SIBLINGS, which premiered at Donaufestival in Austria in 2017, mixes opera and revue, choreographing five performers to explore themes of alienation and empathy.

Synopsis Susan Shawson (Elisha Cuthbert), a 13-year old high-school, inadvertently travels back in time in her apartment building's elevator. As altered by Dr. Reynolds (Michael Sinelnikoff), a retired physicist living upstairs, this secret time machine transports Susan from New York of 1998 back to exactly the same spot in 1881. There she meets Victoria Walker (Gabrielle Boni), a girl her age in need of assistance with her own family problems, most notably a schemer named Cyrus Sweeney (Jean LeClerc) trying to take advantage of her widowed mother Nora (Lynne Adams). When she returns to the present, Susan discovers that her widower father Frank (Timothy Busfield) has been frantically searching for her, assisted by neighbor Edward Ormondroyd (Richard Jutras) and local police detective Gagin (Charles Edwin Powell). Gradually discovering the power of time travel, Susan, Victoria, and her young brother Robert (Matthew Harbour), travel back and forth in time and succeed in changing both the past and the future.

He wrote it not as a hymn but as part of a longer poem which appeared first in 1538. In the current Protestant German hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch, it is EG 319.  History  The reformer Martin Luther wrote the text as part of a longer poem of praise, not intended to be sung. The topic is firstly praise of music, especially singing, which turns to praise of God. The long poem appeared as a preface of a 1538 publication by Johann Walter, Lob vnd preis der loblichen Kunst Musica, praising the art of music. Luther's preface was titled Vorrede auf alle guten Gesangb√ºcher (Foreword on all good hymnals), subtitled Lob der Frau Musica (The praise of Lady Music), with Music speaking. Luther's poem appears also in the Klug'sches Wittenberger Gesangbuch of 1543. The poem is in 40 lines, rhymed in pairs without structure in stanzas, which was a typical way of narration at the time. The lines 25 to 40 were taken as four stanzas. In the first stanza, Frau Musica introduces herself. The personification of the seven liberal arts as female figures was a medieval practice which Luther \\"translated\\" to German. Songbirds are mentioned, possibly representing a peaceful natural life. Luther said in a sermon about the Sermon on the Mount which also mentions birds: \\"Thut doch wie das vogelein, singt, seid frohlich und lasst die Sorge, lernet glauben.\\" (Do as the bird, sing, be joyful and let go of sorrow, learn to believe). The second stanza mentions the nightingale. The other two stanzas develop from the praise of music the praise of God as the Creator.  Melodies and settings  The four stanzas were assigned a melody of the Bohemian Brethren, adapted to a more modern form by Karl L√ºtge in 1917, commemorating 400 years after the Reformation. With this melody, the song was used more as a folk song than a hymn, but appeared in some regional appendices of the Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Kirchengesangbuch (EKG). The text was also sung to a melody and setting by Melchior Vulpius. Arnold Mendelssohn created a melody in triple time and composed a four-part setting. In the current Protestant German hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch, the song with the L√ºtge tune is EG 319. set the melody for four parts.  2017  In 2017, remembering 500 years of the Reformation, the song was the title of a night of broadcasting by the Deutschlandfunk, focused on Luther's hymns and music derived of them. \\"Die beste Zeit im Jahr ist mein\\" was heard in settings by Ernst Pepping and Arnold Mendelssohn.

The Vollketten 30.01 (D), (lit. \\"fully tracked\\" VK, and 30 ()).From , \\"fully tracked\\" was intended to counter the Soviet T-34 and replace the Panzer III and IV as a heavy \\"breakthrough\\" tank. It had been requested in 1941 by the German Government. The Daimler Benz design was rejected however, and the Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N√ºrnberg (MAN) design was selected.  Development  When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, they expected to be facing an inferior opponent. The T-34, with its heavily sloped armor, and the heavily armored KV-1 caught the Wehrmacht off guard. Up until Operation Barbarossa, the Germans had been satisfied with the performance of their early Panzers, even after high losses during the Polish and French campaign, against the Char B1. Ignoring these incidents, and an incident in spring 1941, when Hitler gave the order for a Soviet military commission to be allowed to see the latest in German tank design. The Soviet delegation refused to believe that they had been shown the latest model of the Panzer IV. Afterwards, because of their insistence, the German Ordnance Office came to the conclusion the Soviets were in possession of better and heavier tanks. In October 1941, in the aftermath of the 4th Panzer Division's heavy losses of Panzer IVs on the road to Mtsensk, Generaloberst Heinz Guderian called for an investigation into the matter of tank warfare on the Eastern Front. In November German engineers, manufacturers and military procurement officials, including the Army Weapons Department, were able to inspect and study captured T-34 tanks on the Eastern Front in order to understand what future German tank development would be needed in the next generation of German tanks. It was initially suggested by Guderian that the quickest way to counter the T-34 would be a direct copy. This was turned down by the Army Weapons Department however, because of the difficulties in producing sufficient numbers of diesel engines and steel alloy. Initially four companies, Henschel (H), Porsche (P), Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N√ºrnberg (MAN), and Daimler Benz (DB), were requested to build prototypes with the requirements for a fast heavy medium tank able to defeat the Soviet T-34 tank on the Eastern front. Henschel's design, the VK 30.01(H), was considered outdated, with only a Kwk 37 L/24 short howitzer-like gun and resembling an enlarged Panzer IV, but with the overlapping and interleaved Schachtellaufwerk roadwheel system coming from their half-track designs. The Porsche entry, the VK 30.01(P), developed at the same time as the VK 4501 (P), was withdrawn when the Tiger I went into production. This only left MAN and DB as contenders and so they were ordered to construct improved models, VK 30.02(MAN) and VK 30.01(D). While the VK 30.01(D) could have been cheaper and easier to produce, the German government preferred the roomier turret and more modern suspension of the MAN prototype, which went on to be the production Panther. The VK 30.02(MAN) also shared the same engine as the Tiger, which would help with production and maintenance, it also had larger tracks, which would help with its ground pressure on soft ground.\\"German WWII prototypes\\". Tank Encyclopedia. While the Panther was similar to the T-34 in shape, the VK30.01 (D)'s sloped front was similar, but overall, it was closer to earlier German tanks. Some sources say that one prototype was produced, others say that Daimler Benz produced three slightly different versions.  Specifications  The VK 30.01(D) was a fast, nimble tank weighing , with a top speed of and a cruising range of . Its main armament was the KwK 42 L/70 gun.

He was a faculty member at Harvard Law School, first assistant professor (1899‚Äì1903), later Bemis Professor of International Law (1915‚Äì1918). Between 1903 and 1915, Westengard served as a General Advisor in Foreign Affairs to the Government of Thailand.  Early life and education  Westengard was born in Chicago, the son of Abel August and Nielsigne Dorthea (Iverson) Westengard. His father emigrated from Denmark to the United States in 1863. He attended Chicago public schools and found work as a stenographer. Saving his money to fulfill an ambition to practice law, he paid the tuition to enter Harvard Law School in the fall of 1895. Earning the LL.B.degree in 1898, he graduated second in his class of 129; he entered the Massachusetts bar in the same year. He taught on the faculty of Harvard Law School until 1903.  General Advisor to Siamese Government  In 1903 Westengard left Harvard to become Assistant General Advisor to the government of Siam (present-day Thailand). He worked under his mentor and close Harvard Law School associate Edward H. Strobel. While still also practicing law in Boston, Westengard was made acting General Advisor to the Siamese government, 1905-1907 and 1908-1909. From 1909 to 1915, he served as General Advisor with the rank of Minister Plenipotentiary. From 1915 until his death, he held the Bemis professorship of International Law at Harvard Law School. Westengard's most notable career achievements were in his work for the Siamese government. In that country he played an important role in negotiating settlements in boundary disputes with British Burma and the French colony of Vietnam. He was effective in helping to develop a native government, a state administrative system and a criminal code. Perhaps most important among his achievements in Siam was his effort to abolish extraterritoriality in Siamese courts, i.e., the system whereby native courts could not assert jurisdiction over European or American subjects, as they were entitled to have any civil or criminal suits they were involved in tried in consular courts. He also was appointed judge of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Siam in 1911.Westengard, Jens Iverson. Papers, 1885-1945: Finding Aid. Harvard Law School Library. Through all this, Westengard, and Strobel before him, enjoyed the confidence and support of King Chulalongkorn. As General Advisor, Westengard was enormously influential in effecting a wide variety of reforms and civil improvements on behalf of the government; among these, in addition to those already mentioned, were negotiating foreign loans, drafting legislation and modifying existing laws, planning water works, restructuring the kingdom's finances and system of revenue, negotiated foreign treaties, and proposed ambassadors and ministers. For the coronation of King Rama VI in 1910, Westengard brought together the largest gathering of European royalty in Asia then known. After twelve years in Siam, Westengard resigned from his service to the government in June 1915 and returned to Harvard to take up teaching law again.  Memberships and Honors  Westerngard was a member of the American Society of International Law, the American Bar Association, Massachusetts State Bar Association, Suffolk County Bar Association, Cambridge Historical Society, Cambridge Club, the Travellers and Harvard Clubs of Boston, and various Asian societies. Harvard University awarded him an honorary A.M. degree in 1903. The kingdom of Siam bestowed on him the title Phya Kalyana Maitri. From the Siamese government, he received the Grand Cordon of the Order of the White Elephant, Grand Cross of the Crown of Siam, special second class Order of Chula Chom Klao and second class Order of Ratanaphorn. The French government made him an officer of the Legion of Honor. Denmark awarded him the Grand Cross of the Order of the Danneborg. Considering the differences between teaching law and his work in diplomacy, Westengard could rightly boast that the latter afforded him considerably more honors, as he once wrote in a letter: > I remember well that I dined one night with [Harvard University] President > Eliot, when, pointing out the happiness of the law teacher's lot, he said > that the practicing lawyer was a man 'whose name was writ in water.' No man > should boast till he has safely finished his task; but, come what may, in > Siam my name is writ more substantially on the land than that.  Personal Affairs  Westengard married Rebecca Aubrey Prosser on July 16, 1898 in London, England. They had one son, Jens Aubrey Westengard (b. 1900). Shortly after he was informed that the Siamese government wished him to be their representative at the Paris Peace Conference after World War I, Westengard died in Cambridge, Mass., on September 17, 1918, after a brief illness.

History In Latin, the rank was called decurio (initially, in the cavalry only) and later decanus (in both the infantry and cavalry); the Greek term is Latinised as decarchus. It referred to the second or third-to-last rank, above a pentarch, and later, above a pentarch and tetrarch. (The tetrarch appears in the Strategikon of Maurice, but it may have become a rank earlier, in the reign of Zeno). Variant Greek terms for the rank include () and (). The term Œ¥Œ≠Œ∫Œ±œÅœáŒøœÇ is recorded as early as 135 AD, where it appears as an equivalent of decurion in the Alanica of Arrian. in The Miracles of Saint Demetrius mentions the centarch, pentecontarch and decarch, but not the chiliarch. Conversely, the Life of Saint Philaretus the Merciful does not mention the decarch. Warren Treadgold theorises that this is because at that time the irregular troops of Thessalonica did not amount to 1,000 men and therefore were without a chiliarch, while the Life of Saint Philaretus does not mention decarchs because they were so far beneath the others. Both texts omit the pentarchs and tetrarchs, but they appear again in 9th-century texts and cannot have fallen into disuse in the meantime. The rank's antecedent was the decurio (decurion), originally a cavalry rank under the Roman Republic and the Principate, which became an infantry rank during the Dominate after the reforms of Diocletian. A decurion originally commanded ten men; however, this was reduced by Diocletian to eight (including the decurion himself). Although the Late Roman Œ¥Œ≠Œ∫Œ±œÅœáŒøœÇ seems to have been used interchangeably with decurio and decanus in the East, it sometimes was not used at all: Saint Jerome lists the ranks of a typical cavalry regiment that includes no decarch or decurion, and research shows that some infantry units used this system as well. The source of the innovation is the Scholae Palatinae of Constantine the Great, and Treadgold reasons that at the time frontier regiments East and West using the older and newer rank systems were deployed together, and each understood the system used by the other. For a cavalry regiment like Jermoe's, Vegetius says that the lowest-ranking functionaries were circitor and semissalis and these probably became ranks in the Scholae, roughly equivalent to the decarch. In regiments that used decarchs, there would have been 50 of them. Pay scale Both Byzantine and Arab sources shed some light on the pay scale for the 8th-9th century rank of decarch and its place in the pay scale. Three Arab geographers all seem to have a common source: prisoner of war named al-Jarmi became familiar with a Byzantine military while in Byzantine custody; in fact, one geographer explicitly names al-Jarmi as his source. Al-Jarmi was frontier official who was captured by the Byzantines, probably in a great raid of Theophilus in 837; he was later exchanged in 845. Al-Jarmi wrote a book on the Byzantine empire that survived at least a century for other Arab writers to excerpt, but which is lost today.Al Jarmi is very precise, sometimes more so that surviving Byzantine documents; he probably got hold of an official Byzantine manual published in the wake of Theophilus's military reforms. Al- Jarmi says that a \\"Roman\\" (i.e. Byzantine) soldier was paid 12 nomismata a year, after twelve years service. Treadgold thinks this is a misinterpretation of a policy that started a soldier off with 1 nomisma a year (known from other sources), with twelve years experience probably required to reach the rank of decarch and its attendant 12 nomismata in pay. The pay scales reported by al- Jarmi match in proportion, although not precisely in amount, the later pay scales of Constantine VII.

The L-mount exists in two versions, an APS-C version (TL) and a full-frame version (SL). The two versions are mechanically and electronically compatible. TL lenses mounted on full-frame cameras will cause the camera to use a crop mode from the center of the sensor, corresponding to the APS-C coverage of the lens. SL lenses mounted on TL cameras function normally, providing a 1.5x crop field of view, as is typical with APS-C cameras. In 2018 Leica formed the L-Mount Alliance, licensing Sigma and Panasonic to use an upgraded version of the mount for their own products, opening the way for a more extensive system of fully compatible cameras and lenses.  T-Mount to L-Mount  It was introduced in April 2014 with the Leica T (Typ 701) camera. At the time of introduction, it was called the \\"T-mount\\", but this was changed to \\"L-mount\\" with the release of the Leica SL, a full-frame sensor camera using the same mount. The Leica T was renamed to the Leica TL at this time, to permit marketing clarity for the L-mount lens line: TL lenses would cover APS-C sensors, while SL lenses would cover full-frame sensors.

Police superintendent Tsang (Alex Man) leads chief inspector Tong Fung (Sibelle Hu), Man (Candy Wen) and other sergeants and laid a dragnet for a cleansweep of the two drug traffickers. However, during the drug trade, the ambush by the police was exposed by Chun Bing (Moon Lee), a master of multiple identities, and Chai Yuet (Ray Lui), a tough, ruthless fighter, both of whom engage in a fierce gun battle with the police. Hon believes the incident was a result of Chai betraying him and tipping the police. As a result, Hon's his right hand man, Chiu Sing (Francis Ng), to murder Chai, while Chai's son, Yuet, swears vengeance. Hon's authority has been usurped by Chiu (Francis Ng), who forces Hon to hand him a large sum of gems from his estate when Chiu frames Hon for the murder of Chai.

It was set up in the wake of claims that the bodies of up to 800 babies and children may have been interred in an unmarked mass grave in the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home, located in Tuam, County Galway, but its remit also covers investigation into the records of and the practices at an additional thirteen Mother and Baby Homes. The members of the three-person Commission are Judge Yvonne Murphy (chairperson), Dr William Duncan and Professor Mary E. Daly. Originally scheduled to issue its final report by February 2018, the Commission was granted a one-year extension to February 2019, and sought another extension of a further year in January 2019, due to the workload involved. Background Following widespread news reports in 2014 that the bodies of 796 babies and children may have been interred in an unrecorded mass grave at the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway, there were calls both nationally and internationally for an investigation of the site, and for an inquiry into all such Mother and Baby Homes. Establishment On 4 June 2014, the Irish government announced it was bringing together representatives from various government departments to investigate the deaths at the Bon Secours home and to propose how to address the issue. The then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Charlie Flanagan, said any government inquiry would not be confined to the home in Tuam and that officials would advise the Government on the best form of inquiry before the end of June 2014. On 16 July 2014, the government announced that Judge Yvonne Murphy would chair a Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby homes, including Tuam. In October 2014, the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, James Reilly, announced that the draft terms of reference for the inquiry had been circulated to government departments for comment. On 19 February 2015, Reilly announced that the terms of reference had been agreed at Cabinet for an \\"independent commission, which has a three-year deadline and which will cost approximately ‚Ç¨21 million, following the signing by the of a Government Order at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting\\". The three-person Commission comprises Judge Yvonne Murphy as Chairperson, with international legal expert on child protection and adoption, Doctor William Duncan, and historian Professor Mary E. Daly, appointed as Commissioners. Terms of Reference The Terms of Reference specified for the Commission are to investigate and report on: 1. The circumstances for the entry of single women into Mother and Baby Homes and the exit pathways on leaving, including the extent of their participation in relevant decisions; 2. The living conditions and care arrangements experienced by residents during their period of accommodation, including by reference to the literature on the living conditions and care experienced by mothers and children generally during the period; 3. Mortality among mothers and children residing in the institutions (to determine the general causes, circumstances, and rates of mortality), compared to mortality among women and children generally; 4. Post-mortem practices and procedures in respect of children or mothers who died while resident, including the reporting of deaths, burial arrangements and transfer of remains to educational institutions for the purpose of anatomical examination; 5. The extent of compliance with relevant regulatory and ethical standards of the time of systemic vaccine trials found by the Commission to have been conducted on children resident in one or more of the institutions (including, inter alia, vaccine trials conducted using vaccines manufactured by Burroughs Welcome in 1960/61, 1970 or 1973); 6. Arrangements for the entry of children into the institutions in circumstances when their mother was not also resident at the time of their entry; 7. For children who did not remain in the care of their parents, to examine exit pathways on leaving the institutions so as to establish patterns of referral or relevant relationships with other entities, and in particular to identify: 1. the extent to which the child's welfare and protection were considered in practices relating to their placement in Ireland or abroad; 2. the extent of participation of mothers in relevant decisions, including 1. the procedures that were in place to obtain consent from mothers in respect of adoption, and 2. whether these procedures were adequate for the purpose of ensuring such consent was full, free and informed; and 3. the practices and procedures for placement of children where there was cooperation with another person or persons in arranging this placement, including where an intermediary organisation arranged a subsequent placement; 8. To identify the extent to which any group of residents may have systematically been treated differently on any grounds (religion, race, Traveller identity, or disability). The investigation covers the period from 1922 (the foundation of the state) to 1998. =Institutions included= The Terms of Reference specified that only 14 named mother and baby homes were to be included within the scope of the investigation. These were: * Ard Mhuire, Dunboyne, Co. Meath; * Belmont (Flatlets), Belmont Ave, Dublin 4; * Bessboro House, Blackrock, Cork; * Bethany Home, originally Blackhall Place, Dublin 7 and from 1934, Orwell Road, Rathgar, Dublin 6; * Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home, Tuam, Co. Galway; * Denny House, Eglinton Rd, Dublin 4, originally Magdalen Home, 8 Lower Leeson St, Dublin 2; * Kilrush, Cooraclare Rd, Co. Clare; * Manor House, Castlepollard, Co. Westmeath; * Ms. Carr‚Äôs (Flatlets), 16 Northbrook Rd, Dublin 6; * Regina Coeli Hostel, North Brunswick Street, Dublin 7; * Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, Co. Tipperary; * St. Gerard‚Äôs, originally 39, Mountjoy Square, Dublin 1; * St. Patrick‚Äôs, Navan Road, Dublin 7, originally known as Pelletstown, and subsequent transfer to Eglinton House, Eglinton Rd, Dublin 4; and * The Castle, Newtowncunningham, Co. Donegal. In addition, a \\"representative sample\\" of state-operated County Homes, selected by the Commission as fulfilling a function similar to the Mother and Baby Homes, are included. These are: * St Kevin's Institution (Dublin Union) * Stranorlar County Home, Co Donegal (St Joseph's) * Cork City County Home (St Finbarr's) * Thomastown County Home, Co Kilkenny (St Columba's) Several of the named homes - principally Bessboro House (Cork), Bon Secours (Galway), Manor House (Westmeath), Sean Ross Abbey (Tipperary) and St. Patrick's (Dublin) - had previously been highlighted as sources for illegal domestic and foreign adoptions, with many of the children being trafficked to the United States. Methodology In tandem with carrying out the investigations outlined in the Terms of Reference, the Commission was also empowered to establish a \\"Confidential Committee\\", with the aim of providing a forum for former residents and staff of the named institutions to provide accounts of their experiences. Such accounts may be used to inform relevant investigations, and the Confidential Committee is to publish a report on the accounts received. The Commission also includes a literature-based academic social history module, in order to establish an objective and comprehensive historical analysis of significant relevant matters. The Commission is to rely on this analysis as evidence to inform its investigations and to assist it in framing its findings and conclusions within the wider social and historical context of the relevant period under investigation. Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home The Commission was brought into being following extensive worldwide media coverage of claims that the remains of up to 800 children had been interred in an unmarked mass grave, believed to be a disused septic tank, on the grounds of the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway. In 2014, a local amateur historian, Catherine Corless, had published an article documenting the deaths of 796 babies and toddlers at the Home during its decades of operation. There were death certificates for 796 infants, but no burial records, which raised fears of a mass grave. The report noted that the most commonly recorded causes of death among the infants were congenital debilities, infectious diseases and malnutrition. The article claimed that the bodies were buried in a site at the Home and that there was a high death rate of its residents. Her research led her to conclude that almost all had been buried in an unmarked and unregistered site at the Home, with Corless believing that the site was also the location of a septic tank when overlaid with maps of the period of use as a workhouse. The Irish government came under pressure to launch an investigation, which eventually resulted in the establishment of the Commission in February 2015. =Excavations= As part of its investigations, the Commission ordered excavations of the suspected burial site in Tuam to be carried out. On 3 March 2017, the Commission announced that multiple human remains had been found during excavations carried out between November 2016 and February 2017 at the site. Tests conducted on some of the remains indicated they had been aged between 35 foetal weeks and 2‚Äì3 years. The announcement confirmed that the deceased died during the period of time that the property was used by the Mother and Baby Home, not from an earlier period, as most of the bodies dated from the 1920s to the 1950s. The remains were found in an \\"underground structure divided into 20 chambers.\\" The Commission said \\"it had not yet determined what the purpose of this structure was but it appeared to be a sewage tank. The commission had also not yet determined if it was ever used for this purpose.\\" The Commission stated that it was continuing its investigation into who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way, and that it had notified the coroner. Reactions to excavation find In 2017 Minister for Children Katherine Zappone said that the coroner's results would determine the direction of the investigation and that the Commission would determine if other sites needed to be excavated, including another part of the Tuam site. The Adoption Rights Alliance and Justice for Magdalenes Research campaign groups demanded that Zappone publish a five-month-old report from the Commission on the issue of broadening the probe's terms of reference beyond the original 18 institutions included, and said the state must ensure that all human remains buried in unmarked graves at institutions in Ireland are identified. (The report was published in April 2017; the delay, according to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, was due to the report being referred to the Attorney General for advice on the report's recommendations on the issue of redress.) Taoiseach Enda Kenny described the find as \\"truly appalling\\", saying \\"the babies of single mothers involved had been treated like some kind of sub- species.\\" He commended the work of Catherine Corless in bringing the issue to light. Speaking on the find in D√°il √âireann, in response to requests to widen the terms of reference of the Commission, he described the Mother and Baby Home as \\"a chamber of horrors.\\" In the same debate, AAA-PBP T.D. Br√≠d Smith called for the Bon Secours order of nuns to be disbanded. She said \\"its hospital empire, the biggest private hospital group in the State, was built on the bones of the dead Tuam babies.\\" Smith said \\"everyone was not responsible for what happened in Tuam. It was paid for by the state, which knew exactly what was going on, and there were 'headage payments' of up to US$3,000 for each child sent to the United States.\\" The Taoiseach's speech was criticised by some. In the D√°il, Catherine Connolly directly addressed the speech, stating: Leader of Fianna F√°il, Miche√°l Martin T.D., called for a state apology for the infants, a commemoration to be held for them, and for the expansion of the Commission of Inquiry to include other institutions and sites. The Minister for Justice, Frances Fitzgerald, stated that \\"the discovery is an infinitely sad reminder of an Ireland that was a very harsh, harsh place for women and their babies\\" and that \\"it shows the tortured relationship the State and church had with pregnant women‚Äîit is a tragedy that we are now facing in its entirety.\\" The Catholic Archbishop of Tuam, Michael Neary, said that he was horrified by the confirmation that significant quantities of human remains were buried on the site of a former mother and baby home in the town. Describing the news as \\"a body blow\\", he said he had been \\"greatly shocked to learn of the scale of the practice during the time in which the Bon Secours ran the mother and baby home in Tuam.\\" The Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference apologised for the hurt caused by its part in the system, which they said also involved adoptions. They also urged parishes to ensure that the burial sites of former residents were appropriately marked, and said that \\"the appalling story of life, death and adoptions related to the Mother and Baby Homes has shocked everyone in Ireland and beyond.\\" The President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, speaking about the find at an International Women's Day reception, said there \\"are dark shadows that hang over our meeting, shadows that require us all to summon up yet again a light that might dispel the darkness to which so many women and their children were condemned, and the questions left unanswered as we moved on.\\" President Higgins described Catherine Corless' work as \\"another necessary step in blowing open the locked doors of a hidden Ireland.\\" Both TV3 and RT√â broadcast documentaries on the scandal, with the latter's Claire Byrne Live including a segment listing the names of all 796 children who had died at the home. Catherine Corless appeared on The Late Late Show on 10 March 2017, receiving a standing ovation at the end of the segment. Host Ryan Tubridy said \\"If that audience represents the people watching tonight, there is a hunger in this country for the truth.\\" =Investigation team= In June 2017, Minister Zappone announced the appointment of a team of international experts, comprising an Irish-based forensic archaeologist, a US-based forensic anthropologist and a UK-based forensic scientist, to investigate the burial site. Zappone also said that she was considering broadening the terms of reference for the Commission, in order to \\"help to answer some of the questions which have been raised again in public debate.\\" The team is led by Dr. Niamh McCullagh, who previously worked with the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains in Northern Ireland and the Joint Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Command that aimed to locate the bodies of war dead. Zappone stated that McCullagh will identify options for government, looking at the possibility of exhuming the remains and identifying if there are any further remains on the site that have yet to be discovered. The team is due to complete its final report in September 2017. In July 2017, the team conducted an extensive geophysical survey on the site. This consisted of data collection through a variety of non-invasive techniques, over the course of 5 days. The team liaised with the Coroner for North Galway, An Garda S√≠och√°na, the National Monuments Services and Forensic Science Ireland, and advice was received from the International Committee for the Red Cross. When Pope Francis visited Ireland in August 2018, Zappone raised the issue of the Tuam home in a meeting with him, and told him \\"I hope the Church will make reparation for its part in this shameful chapter,\\" In October 2018 Zappone announced that the remains of children buried in unmarked graves were to be exhumed, identified forensically, and reburied respectfully. The operation would not be straightforward, and presented \\"unprecedented technical and legal issues\\". =Additional issues= On 3 June 2015, the Irish Examiner published a special report which claimed that the Irish Health Services Executive had voiced concerns in 2012 that up to 1,000 children may have been trafficked from the Home, and recommending that the then health minister be informed so that \\"a fully fledged, fully resourced forensic investigation and State inquiry\\" could be launched. The issue had arisen within the HSE when a principal social worker responsible for adoption discovered \\"a large archive of photographs, documentation and correspondence relating to children sent for adoption to the USA\\" and \\"documentation in relation to discharges and admissions to psychiatric institutions in the Western area.\\" The HSE noted that there were letters from the Home to parents asking for money for the upkeep of their children and notes that the duration of stay for children may have been prolonged by the order for financial reasons. It also uncovered letters to parents asking for money for the upkeep of some children who had already been discharged or had died. The social worker had compiled a list of \\"up to 1,000 names.\\" HSE reports mentioned the possibility that children had been trafficked for adoption with one speculating that it was possible that death certificates were falsified so children could be \\"brokered\\" for adoption. In May 2018, Tusla (the Child and Family Agency) referred 126 files to the Commission regarding births that had been falsely registered by the Saint Patrick's Guild adoption agency. In a press release, Minister Zappone said: \\"We have known about the practice of incorrect registrations for many years, but it has been extremely difficult to identify and prove in individual cases because of the deliberate failure of those involved to keep records. However, Tusla has found clear evidence in the case of some records previously held by St Patrick‚Äôs Guild.\\" Reports =Commission reports= The Commission was originally due to issue a final report by February 2018, but was given a one- year extension in December 2017. The report may include recommendations, including recommendations relating to \\"relevant matters that it considers may warrant further investigation in the public interest.\\" It had been due to issue an interim report in 2016, but when published, this report consisted solely of a request for a time extension to 2018 due to the large number of people wanting to make submissions to the Confidential Committee. A second interim report was issued to the Minister in September 2016 and was published in April 2017. The delay, according to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, was due to the report being referred to the Attorney General for advice on the report's recommendations on the issue of redress. A third interim report was published in December 2017. Commenting on the report and announcing the time extension for its final report, Minister Zappone said: The third interim report reveals that legally enforceable discovery orders relating to the records of Catholic religious congregations that ran most of the homes have been issued but the Commission states that \\"some have very little material available while others have provided extensive material.\\" Government Departments, local authorities and the HSE have also been issued with discovery orders. The issues raised in the Commission's third report include: * the time-consuming nature of investigations: \\"in particular, the Commission has spent considerable time trying to establish the burial practices in the mother and baby home in Tuam (Co Galway)\\"; and the electronic scanning of records held by the Child and Family Agency [Tusla]. * \\"There are significant gaps\\" in the material available on institutions \\"and further searches have to be made to try to fill these gaps. For example, the records of some of the various health authorities are proving difficult to find. It is not clear if they have been lost or destroyed or simply that no one knows where they are. This may be due to the changes in structures over the years - from local authorities/Board of Guardians/Boards of Public Assistance to Health Boards and then to the HSE and, in some cases, to the Child and Family Agency. The Commission is continuing its efforts to find this material.\\" * \\"While there are detailed death records available, there are significant gaps in the information available about the burials of babies who died in a number of the institutions under investigation. The Commission is continuing to make inquiries about burials and burial records but it appears that this is an area in which it will be difficult to establish the facts. * \\"The Commission has heard evidence from 140 individuals about conditions in the institutions. These include former residents, workers and representatives of the authorities who ran the institutions. This process is not yet complete and, particularly in respect of the authorities who ran the institutions, cannot be completed until all the documentary evidence has been analysed.\\" =Departmental reports= In July 2017, Minister Zappone announced that in addition to the Commission progressing its independent investigations, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs would separately report each month on the measures being progressed across Government to respond to the issues which have emerged so far from the work of the Commission. The first such monthly report was published on 7 July 2017. The second report was published on 4 August 2017. The third report was published on 1 September 2017, and announced that the Expert Technical Group was working with, among others, the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team, who are world leaders in humanitarian forensic action and best practices in relation to community engagement. Expert Technical Group report In December 2017, the Expert Technical Group reported to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, outlining five possible courses of action on the Tuam site. These are: * Memorialisation: No further investigative work; Return the site to being managed as a memorial; Make site safe for public access. * Exhume known human remains: Recover human remains interred in the chambered structure identified to date and reinter elsewhere; No further forensic analysis of remains. * Forensic excavation and recovery of known human remains: Complete forensic archaeological excavation, recovery and analysis of human remains from the chambers identified to date. * Forensic excavation and recovery, and further evaluation/ excavation of other areas of potential burial/ interest: Complete forensic excavation and recovery of all human remains in memorial garden and any other targeted area, following geophysical survey, assessment of witness statements, historical records, etc. * Forensic excavation of total available area: Full forensic and archaeological excavation of all available ground formerly occupied by the M&B; Home. A total of 0.4 hectares, comprising memorial garden, playground, car park etc. Excludes private built areas (houses and gardens etc. subsequently built on the former site). Zappone said that before any decision was taken on the option to be used, she first wanted to consult with the local community in Tuam and other affected parties, such as relatives of those who were resident in the home. She said the consultation process, which would be undertaken by Galway County Council, would take three months. The Tuam Home Survivors Network said its members had given careful consideration to the Expert Technical Group's report and that the only appropriate action was \\"a complete excavation of the Tuam site to ensure the recovery of all human remains contained there.\\" The Network are also seeking postmortems in respect of each set of human remains and cataloguing of DNA from all remains in order to create the most complete database possible. The Technical Group also identified a number of human rights issues which were outside its terms of reference. Zappone has appointed human rights expert and Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Professor Geoffrey Shannon, to examine these issues and to report to her on his findings. Criticisms The scope of the Investigation and in particular its restriction to just a limited number of named homes has been criticised by, among others, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). In a 2017 report, it stated that the Commission of Investigation \\"is narrow such that it does not cover all homes and analogous institutions [and] therefore may not address the whole spectrum of abuses perpetrated against women and girls.\\" The delay in publishing a final report and the fact that redress for victims of the homes will not be considered until the final report has been published has been criticised by survivors, including the Coalition of Mother and Baby Home Survivors (CMABS). Paul Redmond, chairperson of CMABS, said that many survivors are now elderly and have already died since the revelations about Tuam first emerged, and that \\"This is yet another delaying tactic by the Government to deny survivors truth and justice. The current inquiry is already too limited and excludes many survivors and this delay will now ensure that thousands more survivors are denied justice by death.\\" Survivor Mary Teresa Collins and her daughter Laura Angela Collins chairwoman of Justice 4 All Women & Children said ‚Äú the government is stalling.‚Äù See also * Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home * Ferns Report * Industrial school * Magdalene Asylum * Murphy Report * St Joseph's Industrial School, Letterfrack References Further reading  * Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse: Interim Reports and Final Report (2009) * Report of the Inter- Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries (2013) * Report on three clinical trials involving children and babies in institutional settings 1960/61, 1970 and 1973: Chief Medical Officer (1997) * Report of Dr Deirdre Madden on Post Mortem Practice and Procedures: (2005) * Second Interim Report of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission (September 2016) *  External links  * Mother and baby Homes Commission of Investigation * Department of Children and Youth Affairs home page on issues relating to Mother and Baby Homes * Technical Report on the Tuam Site Stage 2: Options and Appropriate Courses of Action available to Government at the site of the former Mother and Baby Home, Tuam, Co.

It is largest medical facility in the Cagayan Valley Region. History =Early years= In 1945 immediately after the end of World War II, The hospital was established as the 43rd Filed Hospital, an army tent set up by the 37th Infantry which came from Pangasinan under Major Anderson of the United States Marine Corps with cooperation with doctor Venancio del Rosario. It treated both American and Filipino soldier as well as civilians. The American-aided clinic later ceased operations but the defunct Philippine Civilian Auxiliary Unit was converted into Tuguegarao Hospital on June 25, 1945 by Gregorio M. Reyes, the first Cagayan chief and a doctor. It had a 25 bed capacity but the management continued to use several USMC tents situated in front of the Cagayan High School. In June 1945, when schools started another school year and with the early start of the typhoon season, the hospital moved to the war-torn residence of Pedro Atabug and James Whitney. The wages and salaries of the Tuguegarao Hospital's staff and personnel were then funded through donations, shows and dance benefits. =Rehabilitation and expansion= The Tuguegarao Hospital underwent a rehabilitation. Nipa roof and sawali walls augmented the hospital structure. The funds of Secretary of Labor, Marcelo Adduru was significantly helpful in funding the hospital operations. On May 15, 1946, Adduru made the Philippine Relief and Rehabilitation Administration transfer three quonset huts to the hospital at no cost for the Tuguegarao Hospital's nurses' dormitory, storeroom, dispensary and doctor's quarters. The Tuguegarao Hospital was converted into Cagayan Provincial Hospital in November 1945 through the virtue of a Cagayan provincial board resolution under the administration of then Governor Baldomero Perez. The hospital remained under the management of Gregorio M. Reyes. The Provincial board helped generate and set aside funds for the hospital's operation and maintenance and the hospital started to expand. When the hospital's old nipa roofing and the sawali walls started to deteriorate, the hospital transferred to the Division of Schools Building while simultaneously commenced the reconstruction of a two-storey semi- permanent building, which was later occupied by the Integrated Provincial Health Office. Teogenes Alfonso took over the hospital management on September 28, 1947 when Reyes resigned on the same year to open his own private clinic. Justiniano M. Mendoza succeeded Alfonso who launched an intensive campaign targeted to people in rural areas to patronize the hospital's services and facilities. The two-storey building was inaugurated and opened on March 1, 1951 with an increased bed capacity. Menndoza resigned in August 1952 to study in the United States as a scholar. =Name changes and continued expansion= Interior of the hospital building. The hospital now known as the Cagayan Provincial Hospital at that time was designated as Regional Training and Teaching Hospital per Department Administrative Order No. 79, s. 1963 which later was classified as a Tertiary Regional Hospital for Region 02, per Ministry Administrative Order No. 83, s. 1980, dated April 22, 1980. On July 20, 1983, the Regional Health Office Laboratory, Regional Mental Hospital and the Cagayan Provincial Hospital were integrated and became the Integrated Cagayan Regional Hospital. In February 1986, this was transferred to its present site in Carig, Tuguegarao, Cagayan. A bill was proposed to change its name to Cagayan Valley Regional Hospital but did not prosper due to the EDSA Revolution of 1986.

Documents, products, seals or other items can be equipped with a hologram. The hologram is expected to ensure anti-counterfeit protection because it can be neither copied nor imitated (provided that advanced technology has been used for hologram origination). Holograms are considered the strongest anti-counterfeit measure available. Connecting of a hologram with the protected item is a critical task, and there are many specific technologies for it. Microholograms enable to protect material (substrate)l for a production of documents, stamps, products, etc. Tiny metallic particles of the size from 40 micrometers to half a millimeter are blended into plastic, paper, foil, etc. There is a complete hologram on each particle. Microholograms are always tailored for a particular organization, such as a bank, government, and premium goods producer. The organization decides about their: *Shape (often hexagon or square), *Hologram means visual effects, *Letters engraved into each particle. Application machines for production holographic substrates are available in the market. Using such substrate enriched with microholograms enables producers to implement anti-counterfeit protection at several levels. Microholograms appear as metallic dust to a naked eye. However, an alarmed user can go deeper and inspect a document with a magnifier seeing their regular shape, engraved letters, and holographic surface. If suspicion persists, it is possible to go even deeper and watch microholograms with a microscope, checking complete hologram with all visual effects and perhaps specific forensic features.

Style and contents  According to Julien Vittores, on Graffiti Art Magazine issue #28 (2016), Nevercrew's style is based on their mutual communication as duo. They work on the concept of \\"comparison\\" and in fact it's through comparison that they graphically and conceptually express their thoughts about humankind condition and about the relationship mankind has with the natural environment. Nevercrew's work ranges from mural painting to installation, sculpture and small format paintings, including hyperrealistic subjects, graphical elements, site specific interactions, often mixed together. The concept of their artworks is related to environmental and social issues, with a tendency towards a wider vision of the human condition and human attitudes. Their subjects are natural and mechanical, put in a terse confrontation between them within the space in which the artworks are realized.

As automobiles became more popular their clientele asked Derham to provide bodies for their cars.Hugo Pfau, The Coachbuilt Packard, Darlton Watson, London 1973 It was claimed only New York's Brewster had a similar reputation. Following World War II Derham's business steadily declined. Most competitors had already been destroyed by the Great Depression. After the retirement of the last of the founder's sons in 1971 the entire premises were used as a Ferrari dealership. Carriages Derham's Landaus, Victorias, Meadowbrooks, Phaetons and Broughams were much in demand by Philadelphia's √©lite. Their requirements changed to automobile bodies. Automobile bodies To cope with the increased activity Derham required larger premises so a purpose-built plant was erected in Rosemont, Pennsylvania where many of their customers lived. 1926 Pierce-Arrow Series 80 town car 1932 Stutz S-V16 =Custom bodies= Derham always made one-off custom bodies but they were financially stabilised by taking on regular series production work. =Semi-custom bodies= From early on dealers would order more than one body of a particular design and this cost-saving practice grew to become short production runs of perhaps 20 or more identical automobiles. Cars made before the 1930s were mostly formal and intended to be chauffeur- driven but by the end of the 1920s Derham was making attractive convertibles and they became the bulk of production. Derham developed their own distinctive automobile body style. Most of their bodies were built in series on Packards and Hudsons but they continued to build one-off cars on any chassis their customer required. During the 1930s Derham survived by building some bodies on Ford V8s and by taking on a Plymouth - De Soto dealership. Once war began they moved to building mobile canteens for Philadelphia's shipyards. Aircraft components were added to their productions line. 1949 Packard Super Eight town car 1946 body on a 1941 Lincoln Continental convertible for and designed by Raymond Loewy The same car in 2007 without the rear spare and with an altered grille To combat cost increases Derham took to amending standard sedan bodies making them into limousines and also changing appearance by fixing soft padding over the standard sedan's top. Most of the standard structure remained intact. This allowed Derham to survive into the postwar period. Business Week wrote about Derham Body in their April 22, 1950 issue. Derham reprinted it listing some current and former clients: Raymond Loewy, Pope Pius XII, Cardinal Spellman, Duke of Windsor, Harry Truman, Cole Porter, Gary Cooper, Louis B Mayer, James Forrestal, Herbert Pulitzer, Lily Pons, Leopold Stokowski, Bernard Baruch, Rodman Wanamaker and Marjorie Merriweather Post Davies. During 1956 Derham built a prototype Lincoln Continental Mark II convertible but Ford's project did not result in any more cars. Garthwaite The Derham business and its building were sold to Al Garthwaite in 1964 when business had been reduced to armoring Cadillac and Lincoln limousines and restoration of classic cars. Floyd-Derham Disagreements after the founder's death led to one of his sons going out on his own with William Floyd, a European car importer. Floyd-Derham exhibited for the first time in the fall of 1928. The onset of the depression led Floyd to pull out of the partnership and Philip Derham began to work for Duesenberg.

This process is accomplished by flowing a stream of liquid-suspended material over a screen and subjecting the screen to a vertical hydraulic pulsation. This pulsation momentarily expands or dilates the screen bed and allows the heavier materials to work toward the bottom. Heavier material, or concentrate, that is finer than the screen openings will gradually work through the beds and the retention screen into the hutch, or lower compartment. That material, the concentrate, is continuously discharged from this compartment or hutch through a spigot. If the concentrate is coarser than the screen, it will work down to the top of the shot bed, and can be withdrawn either continuously or intermittently. The lighter material, or tailing, will be rejected over the end of the jig. The mineral jig has been widely used in recovering valuable heavy minerals such as gold, platinum, tin, tungsten and lower density minerals, gemstones such as diamond and sapphire from alluvial or placer deposits. Jigs have also been widely used in hardrock mill applications for recovering of coarse heavy minerals liberated in open or closed grinding circuits. Base metals, iron, manganese ores and barite have also been recovered using jigs. Where the difference between the density of the mineral being sought and the gangue is large, as in the case of gold or platinum, the ‚ÄúPlacer Jig‚Äù achieves very efficient recoveries even of minus 50 mesh particles. The mineral jig has certain advantages in placer and hardrock mill flowsheets. In gold recovery the jigs produce highly concentrated products which can be easily upgraded by methods such as barrel amalgamation, treating across shaking tables or processing through centrifugal concentrators. In other placer operations the heavy minerals being sought are recovered efficiently and cheaply with similar high ratios of concentration. In iron, manganese and base metal treatment flowsheets, the jigs are operated to produce marketable grades of concentrate; or, as pre-concentration devices, to reject barren gangue prior to the ore entering the fine grinding section of the mill flowsheet. The construction of the mineral jig results in maximum utilization of floor area and minimum head room requirements, permitting greater capacity per unit of operating floor area than, for example, shaking tables or other devices. The design of the machine contributes to minimum operating and maintenance costs and negligible parts replacement expense.

Youth After completing two years of education at a village school, the young Matveyev moved to St Petersburg where he held various occupations: he was a doorman at an apartment block, for instance, before becoming in 1913 an assistant to a metal-worker at the Vulcan works.Nikita Petrov (2017), \\"The butchers of Sandarmokh\\", Novaya gazeta, No. 84, 4 August 2017, pp. 8-9 . Following the 1917 February Revolution he joined the Bolsheviks and soon was serving as a Cheka executioner. In 1923 he took a few years away from his new occupation. From 1927 onwards Matveyev was back with the successor organisations, the OGPU and NKVD, as an executioner in the Leningrad Region.Anatoly Razumov (n.d.), A Path of Sorrow: the Solovki transports, 1937-1938 (Skorbny put: Solovetskie etapy, 1937-1938) , pp. 38-39.

Sandarmokh, 1937-1938 Matveyev was personally involved in the shooting of the prisoners of the \\"lost Solovki transport\\" between 27 October and 3 November 1937, who included many members of Ukraine's Executed Renaissance. The Sandarmokh killing field was only found in July 1997 after lengthy searches and at first it was not known how many thousands had been shot and buried there. The identity of the 1,111 prisoners brought from the Solovki \\"special\\" prison in the White Sea was first established in the summer of 1996. Their deaths were followed over the next 13 months by those of a further 3,500 inhabitants of Karelia and 4,500 workers from the White Sea Canal, leading to a total of 9,500 killings, with the bodies buried in 236 communal pits. The executions were part of the Great Purge that ran from 1936 to 1938. Later career On 20 December 1937, Captain Mikhail Matveyev was given a commemorative gift, a radiogram and a set of gramophone records, for his \\"selfless work in the struggle against counter-revolution\\", i.e. his work at Sandarmokh between 27 October and 10 November that year. On 11 March 1939 he was himself arrested on the orders of the new head of the NKVD Lavrenty Beria and sentenced to 10 years in a corrective labour camp. (On hearing this news, his fellow executioner Alexander Polikarpov shot himself.) Matveyev was not deprived of his awards and medals, however, and soon his sentence was reduced to three years, which he served in a camp in the Vologda Region. Released early when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, during the Leningrad Blockade Matveyev was made komendant (chief executioner) of the NKVD internal prison in the city. He later received the highest Soviet award, the Order of Lenin, for his work in those years.Anatoly Razumov (n.d.), Skorbny put: Solovetskie etapy, 1937-1938 , p. 39-40. He retired in December 1949. Life after Stalin, 1953-1971 Certain of those involved in selecting, escorting and then shooting the Solovki transport were questioned and investigated after Stalin's death as part of the process of rehabilitating their victims. Like Matveyev, Major Pyotr Raevsky (1892-1967) was also arrested in 1939. He was accused of being \\"one of the leaders of a counter-revolutionary, insurgent organisation among the convicts on Solovki\\" and was sentenced in 1941 to 8 years in the camps. There he was employed as head of the solitary confinement unit in the punishment block. Released in 1947, Raevsky was rehabilitated in 1957 and re-admitted to the Communist Party. In the early 1960s, he was subjected to internal Party discipline for his active part in the Solovki executions.Anatoly Razumov (n.d.), Skorbny put: Solovetskie etapy, 1937-1938 , pp. 36-40.

He is best known for his work in the medium of painting and has been called the Hanoch Levin of Israeli art. Okun's art is characterised for its reference to classical baroque traditions, which he identifies as tragic comedy in the tragicomic absurd perspective. He is a senior lecturer at Bezalel Academy of Arts in Jerusalem, where he has taught for more than 30 years. Biography Okun was born in 1949 in Saint Petersburg (then Leningrad), USSR. From 1961 to 1964, he began painting in the studio Solomon Levin at the Palace of Pioneers. Okun studied at Art School 190 from 1964 to 1966. Okun later studied at Stieglitz State Art and Industry Academy, where he graduated with Master of Arts in 1971. He taught drawing at the Art School Number 2 and in the House of Pioneers in Leningrad from 1972 to 1976. During this time, Okun was also a member of the \\"Alef\\" section of the underground art movement. He exhibited at the first exhibition of non-conformist art in the \\"Gaza\\" Palace of Culture. Okun also exhibited at the \\"Nievsky\\" Palace of Culture in Leningrad, as well as in the Museums of Contemporary Art in Erevan (Armenia) and museums and galleries in the United States. He immigrated to Israel in 1979. \\"The superb painterly qualities of the paintings link Okun to the European post-Renaissance tradition. Okun‚Äôs paintings neither reflect nor imitate. They walk a fine line between caricature and the grotesque, but do not stoop to crudity. His works have been rightly compared to frescoes in terms of the sensation they create. We can think of Giulio Romano‚Äôs Hall of the Giants in the Palazzo del Te, Mantua, from the 16th century, or some of the figures in the San Antonio della Florida in Madrid by Goya (1799), both wall paintings full of fantasy and severity.\\"[4] Okun has been the illustrator of many books of I. Guberman, B. Kamyanov and S. Schwartzband. Beginning in 1986, Okun taught drawing at the Bezalel Academy of Art in Jerusalem, where he is senior lecturer at this time. From 1988 to 2001, he taught drawing and painting at Emunah College in Jerusalem. By the late 1980s, Okun collaborated with Igor Guberman to broadcast \\"Eight and a Half\\" on Israel Radio. He also worked with Guberman to create the Israeli television programme \\"On Three\\", which was released in 2003. =Authorship= Okun translated Elie Wiesel's Souls on Fire into Russian. The book was first published underground in 1979 and has been published three times. He published his book The Book of Tasty and Healthy Life (2002), The Guide to the Country of the Elders of Zion (2009), which were co-authored by Guberman. He has also published Culinary Midrash (2000), Placebo (2007), , Kamov and Kaminka (2015) and Romance with a pencil (2019). Okun has also illustrated of books for Guberman, Boris Kamyanov and Sholom Schwartzbard. Awards and recognition Okun has been recognized internationally for this work. During the 1980s, he received the Ofer Feniger Award and scholarships from Gestetners and the International Centre for Arts Cit√© in Paris. He was named an Honorary Citizen of Jefferson County, Kentucky in 1989. In 2014, Okun received the Mordechai Ish Shalom prize for Achievements in Art.

In 2017, NJPW produced three events under the Destruction name; Destruction in Fukushima on September 10, Destruction in Hiroshima on September 16, and Destruction in Kobe on September 24. These were events fifteen to seventeen under the Destruction name. Production =Background= 2017 was the second consecutive year in which NJPW held three events under the Destruction name. From 2007 to 2013, NJPW held one Destruction event per year, expanding to two shows in 2014 and 2015 and to three shows in 2016. The three shows aired live through NJPW's internet streaming service, NJPW World, with English commentary provided for the Hiroshima and Kobe events. =Storylines= The Destruction shows featured professional wrestling matches, each of which involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Zack Sabre Jr. challenged for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship in the main event of Destruction in Hiroshima Destruction in Fukushima would be headlined by Minoru Suzuki making his third defense of the NEVER Openweight Championship against Michael Elgin. This match stemmed from the 2017 G1 Climax, where Elgin defeated Suzuki, challenging him to a title match afterwards. On September 7, Suzuki and Elgin agreed to turn the match into a lumberjack deathmatch, which was made official the following day. The show would also feature Chaos' Kazuchika Okada, Rocky Romero and Toru Yano challenging Los Ingobernables de Japon's Bushi, Evil and Sanada for the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. The match would mark IWGP Heavyweight Champion Okada's first- ever shot at the title and also served as a prelude to Evil challenging him for the Heavyweight title on October 9 at King of Pro-Wrestling. Destruction in Hiroshima would be headlined by Hiroshi Tanahashi making his second IWGP Intercontinental Championship defense against Zack Sabre Jr. During the 2017 G1 Climax, Sabre put himself in title contention by scoring two submission wins over Tanahashi, first in their opening tournament match on July 17 and again in a non-tournament six-man tag team match on August 13. In the semi- main event, Sabre's Suzuki-gun stablemate El Desperado would challenge Kushida for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship in the champion's second title defense. El Desperado defeated Kushida during the 2017 Best of the Super Juniors and on June 27, after Kushida had successfully defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Bushi, hit him with a guitar and challenged him to a title match. While Kushida was absent from the G1 Climax tour, El Desperado made repeated challenges towards him. When the two finally met on August 12, El Desperado hit Kushida with his own title belt, which he then proceeded to steal. The show would also feature Suzuki-gun, with Taichi and Yoshinobu Kanemaru challenging Funky Future (Ricochet and Ryusuke Taguchi) for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. In addition, the show would feature Roppongi Vice's final match together as a tag team. After unsuccessfully challenging then IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) for the title on July 2, Roppongi Vice agreed to disband with Rocky Romero giving Beretta his blessing to move to the heavyweight division. Juice Robinson, who challenged for the IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship in the main event of Destruction in Kobe Destruction in Kobe would be headlined by Kenny Omega defending the IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship against Juice Robinson. This match also stemmed from the 2017 G1 Climax, where Robinson picked up a win over Omega, asking for a shot at his IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship in a post-match interview. With Omega having won the tournament on July 2 to become the inaugural IWGP United States Heavyweight Champion, this match would mark the first-ever defense of the title. Omega was scheduled to participate in the entire tour, but on September 6, it was announced that he had suffered a knee injury and was pulled from shows between September 7 and 22. He was replaced by the debuting Leo Tonga, the youngest brother of Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa. Several matches on the Kobe card were changed following events that took place at the Hiroshima show. In addition to these title matches, all three shows would also feature a three-way tag team match for the IWGP Tag Team Championship with War Machine (Hanson and Raymond Rowe) taking on Killer Elite Squad (Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Lance Archer) and Guerrillas of Destiny (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa). The first two matches would take place under regular three-way rules, while the third match would be contested under tornado tag team match rules. After successfully defending the title against Bullet Club's Cody and Hangman Page on August 13, War Machine were confronted and challenged to a title rematch by Guerrillas of Destiny. However, before they could respond, both teams were attacked by the Killer Elite Squad. This marked a return for K.E.S., who had not been seen together since the previous February, when Archer was sidelined with a lumbar disc herniation.

The bulk of the work is a phonetic study in which the 9000 characters of the Shuowen Jiezi and 7000 additional characters are grouped into 1137 series, each sharing a phonetic element. These phonetic series were further grouped into 18 Shijing rhyme groups, based on Duan Yucai's dictum that characters sharing a phonetic element belonged in the same rhyme group. The work thus anticipated the structure of Bernard Karlgren's Grammata Serica Recensa. The work also includes very detailed notes on rhyming, semantics, and interchangeable characters.

Considered to have been the country's most successful female singer of her day, she retired from the Royal Theatre while still young but continued to perform and give singing lessons at the Casino Theatre. Biography Born in Stockholm in 1826, Leocadie Bergn√©hr was the daughter of the Swedish customs inspector Carl Vilhelm Bergn√©hr (1803‚Äì1847) and Charlotta Vilhelmina Christina Philp (1799‚Äì1871). She was the sister of the Swedish actress Zelma Hedin and the cousin of Laura Bergn√©hr. In 1852, she married the customs official Carl Edvard Fossum. After a divorce in 1857, she married the singer Carl Ludvig Gerlach (1833‚Äì1893). In February 1844, Bergn√©hr made her d√©but in Donaurum at the Mindre Teater in Stockholm, impressing the audience with the golden tones of her mezzo-soprano delivery. The Swedes suggested she should go to Paris for further training but she was encouraged by Jonas Collin to join the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen where she could study under Henrik Rung. Later in 1845, she appeared as Filippo in Henrik Rung's operetta Aagerkarl og Sanger. She went on to play a wide variety of roles, including Therese in Friedrich Kuhlau's R√∏verborgen, Etle in Emil Hartmann's Liden Kirsten, the queen in Heinrich Marschner's Hans Heiling and Madam Voltisubito in J.L. Heiberg's Recensenten og Dyret. In 1947, after she had performed with the German operatic soprano Wilhelmine Schr√∂der-Devrient at the summer palace of Sanssouci, Bergn√©hr received a travel grant which enabled her to spend a year in London studying under Manuel Garc√≠a. On her return to Copenhagen, she was given a permanent contract with the Royal Theatre. Heiberg commented that she had become \\"the glamorous centerpiece around whom all the other members of the opera congregated\\". Her roles in subsequent years included Vilhelmine in √âdouard Du Puy's Youth and Folly, Anna in Mozart's Don Giovanni and Susanne in his Le nozze di Figaro. In 1858, Leocadie Gerlach was elevated to the rank of Kongelig Kammersanger (Royal Chamber Singer) by King Frederick VII. Her last appearance was in November 1866 when she played her most successful part, the title role in Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia. She left the Royal Theatre that year following a dispute with the administration, leaving her with only limited pension rights. As a result, she continued to sing in the Casino Theatre where she also taught young aspirants. In 1872, she became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. While in Germany in 1873, she impressed Richard Wagner with her still powerful voice. For many years after her retirement, she continued to teach, also giving lessons at the Royal Danish Theatre. Leocadie Gerlach died in Copenhagen in 1919, reaching the age of 93 and still in possession of all her faculties.

High winds of 50 km/h caused by the storm fueled around 20 to 30 significant fires that swept through the town of Knysna and surrounding areas in the days after the storm. The fires killed seven people and displaced around 10,000 with around 600 structures in Knysna and Plettenberg Bay being destroyed. The fires were notable for involving the largest deployment of firefighters in South Africa to that date. A total of 985 firefighters along with 78 vehicles, ten helicopters, and two fixed winged aircraft were used in combating the fire between 6 June and 10 June 2017. It is estimated that the fires caused between R4 billion and R5 billion (around US$297 million to US$372 million) in damages to private property with an additional R136 million worth of damage done to public infrastructure. Unofficial preliminary conjecture suggested that some of the fires might have been lit by arsonists. However, it was later found that the fires started as a result of lightning. Forensic scientist Dr David Klatzow has ruled out arson as the cause of the Knysna fires that killed seven people and left many homeless two months ago.

Prior to the 2018 Armenian parliamentary election, the Free Democrats formed a political alliance known as the We Alliance with the Hanrapetutyun Party, another pro-Western and pro-European party in Armenia. During the election campaign, the Free Democrats advocated that Armenia should withdraw its membership from the Eurasian Union and pursue closer relations with the European Union. The party also advocated for visa-free travel for Armenian citizens to the EU's Schengen Area. The Alliance received 2.00% of the votes.

Ideology The Free Democrats believe in establishing a more democratic Armenia, including developing a stronger civil society, a liberal market economy, greater protection of the environment and integrating Armenia into the European Union. The party firmly believes that Armenia's future is connected with Europe. Party leader Khachatur Kokobelyan, had previously submitted a draft resolution calling for Armenia's Eurasian Union membership to be terminated. Kokobelyan stated that, \\"After joining the Eurasian Union, Armenia has faced greater problems, for example, in its relations with the EU, than it has received dividends. I am confident that we do not need this organization.

He was accused of selling his fish out of season. The mass protest movement was met with violent repression from the Moroccan regime with many violent clashes between police and protesters in various cities and towns, such as the El·∏•usima, Eddriwesh, Enna·∏çor provinces and led to the arrest of more than 150 Moroccans, seen by the regime as protagonists/leaders or media activists in the movement. The leader of the Rif mass protests, Nasser Zefzafi, was arrested by Moroccan law enforcement and intelligence operatives using telephone tracing technology on May 29, 2017, close to a beach near El Hoceima. Right after his arrest, Zefzafi was flown in a military helicopter directly to Casablanca (500 km away), where he is being held and tried by a court of law for charges of sedition and conspiracy as of March 10, 2018. The Moroccan authorities chose to detain him away from his native city and his popular base to defuse the protest movement and to avoid mass escalations in his home city. Context Funeral of Mouhcine Fikri in Imzouren. Mouhcine Fikri, a 31-year-old fish seller, was crushed to death in a rubbish bin on October 28, 2016 in the city of Al Hoceima after trying to recover his confiscated merchandise. This death led to a set of protests that were regularly held and included more and more demands. The protests were led by activist Nasser Zefzafi. The protests were described as \\"the largest display of public anger in Morocco since the Arab spring in 2011.\\" The demands The list of demands is the ground of the protests and includes: * Respecting, preserving and protecting the distinct Berber identity and language of the Rif and the Riffians. * Release of political prisoners. * Serious inquiry and trial of those responsible for the death of Mohcine Fikri. * Demilitarisation of the Rif region. * Construction of a regional cancer hospital, university, library, theatre, roads and fish processing facilities. * A say in how promised local investment money is spent. Repression A demonstration at Al Hoceima. On May 29, 2017, Nasser Zefzafi was arrested in Al Hoceima. Following this arrest came hundred others. Following these arrests, daily protests began in Al Hoceima, Imzouren and other neighboring cities demanding the release of Zefzafi and the other activists.  King's response  King Mohammed VI's only official direct response came in a communiqu√© read on Sunday 25 June 2017, by the spokesperson of the Palace, Abdelhak El Mrini. The king's statement was framed as part of a routine council of ministers, which the king presided over the same day. In this statement the king alluded to what he described as \\"delays\\" in a project he claims to have launched for the development of Al Hoceima in October 2015, while he was in T√©touan. The king then blamed his ministers for presenting projects to him which do not have realistic expectations and budgets, and added that \\"he would not allow those ministers to go on vacation this summer\\". The king then went on, in what looked like blame directed at the protestors, when he stressed that his \\"development and social projects should not be politicised\\". The king's first direct response was when the issue was brought up by French President Emmanuel Macron, who visited him on 14 June. During the brief press conference held after Macron's arrival, the French President said that he questioned the king in a direct and frank manner about the turbulence in the Rif, and that he sensed in the king's response a \\"will that goes in the sense of appeasement and not escalation of the situation\\". Macron also reported that the king said to him, that \\"he inaugurated the practice of spending vacations in Al Hoceima\\", and the king claimed to Macron, that \\"contrary to other countries, people in the Rif were free to protest\\". On 28 June 2017, speaking on behalf of the king, Prime Minister Saadeddine Othmani issued a video statement, in which he commended the king's directives to conduct development projects in all of Morocco, not just Al Hoceima, while he expressed his regrets regarding the crackdown of El Eid, and regretted the injured amongst the police and population. In the statement, Othmani also reported the king's wish for a very strict respect of the conditions of a fair trial of the 150 arrested in the Hirak, while also calling for respect of the law in dealing with claims of torture reported by the Rif detainees. On July 23, 2017, in a speech commemorating his 18th anniversary of his ascension to the throne, King Muhammad VI rebuked local officials in northern Morocco for their failure to implement development projects in a timely manner. He also pardoned a number of activists who had been detained, including the singer Silya Ziani.  Timeline of crackdown  * On Monday 26 June, which coincided with the celebration of Eid el-Fitr, the security forces (police, gendarmerie and auxiliary forces) launched a vast crackdown in Al Hoceima and the surrounding areas, to disband a planned march in solidarity with the detainees. This resulted in widespread violence and beating. The crackdown started early on the day of the feast by surrounding places of prayer, and preventing people from gathering in large numbers for the Eid's prayer. The gendarmerie and police then completely surrounded and blocked all accesses to the city of Al Hoceima, including patrolling the surrounding hills and mountains and stopping people trying to get to the city on foot. The police forces strictly prevented all cars and taxis from entering Al Hoceima, fearing a potential influx of protestors to the city from neighbouring populous areas such as Nador and El Aroui. The violence of the day resulted in the arrest of about 60 people, and many more unaccounted for and a large number of injuries amongst the population, also unaccounted for because of the media blockade. The government official press then published various stories in its media claiming that 39 members of police were injured.  Crackdown on free speech  thumb A central person in the conflict about free speech is the journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui. Born in 1979, he graduated from college in 2004 and from the journalism institute in 2010. He worked in various publications, where he was known as a go-to-guy for sensitive issues that are generally avoided by the average reporter. He championed advocacy journalism, freely expressing his views and criticizing the government. He has also once said, \\"‚Ä¶ a journalist has to shape public opinion by reporting the news but also by giving his own views.\\" Since he launched the news site \\"Badil.info\\" in 2014, Mahdaoui has become one of the most prominent faces in the media world in Morocco, not only because of his iconoclastic personality, but also because of a series of lawsuits that have been filed against him by various state security services and ministries. In June 2016, a court in Casablanca sentenced him to a four-month suspended sentence and $1000 fine for defamation over his report on corruption by then-Minister of Justice. Mahdaoui's journalism became more opinionated. Through critical reports and long format videos posted on his news site and on YouTube, his followers base grew with each video that gets viewed by several hundred thousands soon after its posting. His profile continued to grow during the latest flare up of protests in the Rif, when he posted several critical videos supporting demands by the peaceful protesters and decrying repression by security forces. Mahdaoui was eventually arrested, mistreated, denied health treatment, sentenced to three months then to one year in jail, and accused of a felony that will likely end up with a heavy sentence. Speaking on Mahdaoui's arrest and mistreatment by Morocco's police, M. Aabid, a fellow reporter, said, \\"This is not about one single person, this is about the issue of freedom of expression.\\" \\"El Mahdaoui has personified the idea that you can criticize the policies of the king without fear and the authorities don't like this idea.\\"  Reaction from U.S Congress  A protest in Paris demanding the release of the Hirak prisoners US Senator Tim Kaine, \\"a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia, and Counterterrorism,\\" as well as a vice presidential running candidate in the 2016 presidential election, has issued a letter regarding the current situation in Morocco during August 2017. Kaine wrote in his letter, \\"I have concerns regarding the state of democratic institutions and human rights in Morocco. Citizens are not fully protected with respect to expressing themselves, independent media outlets are significantly restricted.\\" About the current social unrest, he also added: \\"In the past several months, tens of thousands of Moroccans joined protests calling for economic opportunity, political rights, and an end to corruption. In response, the government has arrested over 100 leaders of the protest movement. [‚Ä¶] I am very concerned about these developments and strongly support the right of all people to peacefully express their grievances.\\"  Impact at European and international level  At international level, the repression of the Popular Movement to the Rif has had serious consequences on the population, forcing many young people to emigrate outside Morocco and this made the Riffian movement continue mainly in Europe where there is a large community of Riffian origin. On the other hand, the demands raised by the Popular Movement to Riff have given way to more political demands and where the thought of republican ideological tendency is penetrating more and more between the numerous and historical Riffian diaspora. And at the European level, commissions to support the Riffian movement have been organized in different European cities, and over time more civil organizations are being created, both in solidarity and in defense of civil and political rights. In July 2019 the First Riffian World Congress in Catalonia was organized.

De Garis with music by Reginald A.A. Stoneham. It played in Australia in 1920 and is generally considered the first Australian musical comedy, distinct from operetta or light opera.  Synopsis  The convoluted plot involved a budding English playwright Fitzwilliam Ferguson who is sent to Australia by a rich uncle, and who falls in love with his typist, Flo Hastings. His uncle recalls him to England and promises to make him his heir, if he can become a 'proper' English gentleman. All the complications are resolved in the end. The \\"mystery\\" centred on the meaning of the enigmatic title, for which solutions were solicited and a prize offered.  Productions  The original production, produced by the Tivoli Circuit, starred Maggie Moore, Rex London, Minnie Love, Billy Rego, Hugh Steyne, Marie Le Varre and Charles H. Workman. The musical opened 28 August 1920 at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Adelaide, followed by a week in Perth and a fortnight in Melbourne. Several of its songs were recorded and were popular in Australia for a few years. Critical reception Reviewers found this production one of the best shows seen in Adelaide. Some reviewers considered it equal to any imports. The scenery and Australian character roused enthusiasm. Overall, the show had a successful run, but it was not revived.

It runs from Leeds railway station, via Holbeck Urban Village and Old Holbeck, passes near Elland Road Stadium and ends onto wasteland in Wortley. The viaduct was built in 1882 for the London and North Western Railway during the Industrial Revolution. It has been described as a feat of Victorian engineering, and provided a vital transport link into the booming city centre, which by the turn of the 20th century had developed into an important centre for the production of woollen cloth (See History of Leeds). The viaduct largely fell out of use in the 1960s following Leeds City Station modernisation, and the last scheduled train to pass over the viaduct did so on 11 October 1987. A number of uses for the viaduct have been suggested, including a community garden, green walkway, arts space, park, cycle path, events hub, public allotment, caf√©, music venue, viewing platform, local landmark or other community-focused project.

Early life Karol was taught at the Stankow family estate near Minsk (Stankow today is known as Sta≈Ñkava, and is in Belarus, in the District of Dzyarzhynsk, or Kojdanava), and then was enrolled in the German grammar school Annenschule in Saint Petersburg , where he graduated in 1878. He studied political economics and statistics at the University of Tartu and graduated in 1882. His father Emeric worked in the Russian civil service and also was organizing and cataloging his large numismatic collection, so Karol at age twenty two began administrating the family properties, one of the largest in the Province of Minsk. The properties included 40,000 hectares of agricultural land, forests, mills, wood distilleries, distilleries of alcohol, brickyards, and orchards.Dedicated to the Relics of My Country Saved from the World\`s Storms, The Emeryk Hutten-Czapski Museum, By Kocojowa, Maria , Published by Wydawnictwo Literackie Krakow, 1978. English edition translated by Zofya Mohl and Therese Dayton. pp 53-54 They also owned a large brewery which continues active today. In 1886 he started working in the Ministry of Finance as a collegiate secretary, rising to the rank of court counsellor in 1900. President of Minsk First Mandate (1890-1893): In 1890 he was elected President of Minsk for his first term. He finalized the construction of the Municipal Theatre(today the Janka Kupala National Theatre). In his first year the telephone was brought to Minsk, and a public telephone system was installed. In 1892, a tram pulled by horses was introduced. He built shelters for the homeless. He implemented a system for urban growth control and building approvals. He created a Health Committee, and in 1893 had a bridge built over the Svislach river. He created a series of ditches and walls to ease flooding, a usual problem in Minsk. Second Mandate (1893-1897): During his second mandate, he renounced his state salary and continued his reforms. He created various schools, approved a new plan for the city (which began a period of rapid expansion), built a maternity ward, and created a credit institution for mortgages. He established insurance for agriculture, and the creation of a municipal slaughterhouse. He improved the sewer systems. He created a modern urban water supply system. In commemoration of the installation of the water supply, a fountain featuring a boy with a sawn was created. He established pawn shops, so that the poor were able to raise credit. He established a sports society and created a bicycle track around the main park. In 1894 the first power generator was installed. Third Mandate (1897-1901): He began his third and last mandate, with a new urban plan. He opened a second school for women. In 1900 the Minsk Public Library was inaugurated. He improved the roads and pavements. He founded two newspapers, the \\"Minsk Provincial Newspaper\\" and the \\"Minsk Paper\\". In 1898 a hospital for prostitutes was opened. While serving as President of Minsk he lived on his estate in Stankow and went regularly on horseback to Minsk, regardless of the weather. He continued managing the family properties, establishing a hospital for infectious diseases for the employees of the estate. Many of the projects for the city were financed from his own resources, which was not without great prejudice to the family finances. Because of the great effort in both managing his family properties and serving as President of Minsk, he weakened and fell ill. He spent some time at a sanatorium in Baden, Germany. When he returned he founded a society for the protection of women. In 1901 he organized in Minsk an industrial and agricultural fair. He participated in the fair, showing thoroughbred cattle, pedigree horses and dogs, as well as bricks and ceramics, all coming from his Stankow estate. Karol had to resign because of health reasons in 1901, and in 1904 he died of tuberculosis, in Frankfurt, Germany. During his eleven years as President, Minsk underwent the period of its greatest economic and cultural growth. He contributed greatly in modernizing the city. He put all his personal strength as well as his finances to develop and transform Minsk. Thanks to his efforts, it became a \\"European\\" city, in terms of buildings, services, amenities, industrialization and culture. Being an aristocrat, after Belarus came under Soviet influence, Czapski was seen as the \\"enemy\\" and largely forgotten. Today there is a resurgence of recognition for his work and a street has been named after him. Beer Distillery In 1893 Karol bought a beer brewery, which was named \\"Steam brewery Bohemia of Count Czpaski\\". He built a new building, installed new equipment, electricity, and as well as a steam engine and boiler. In 1896 the brewery was distinguished with a medal at a Russian Fair in Novgorod. When Karol fell ill towards the end of 1899, he sold the brewery. Today the Carlsberg Group is the majority share owner of the brewery. In 2014 In honor of its founder, on his birthday, a plaque was dedicated to Karol Czapski and an exhibition was held that hosted the Czapski Cup featuring historic beer labels and corks from private collections. Private life In July 1894 he married Maria (\\"Marichette\\") Leontyna Pus≈Çowska (1870-1965). They had four children: Fabianna, Elzbieta, Emeryk August, (Member of Parliament 1930-1938), and Wojciech .

At the next road course race at the 1999 Frontier @ the Glen, the team leased the #19 to Paul Gentilozzi after he wrecked the #92 Homelink Ford he originally planned to enter, but the effort did not qualify. Roehrig made his final Cup attempt of 1999 with Hubert the following week but Michigan, but failed to qualify. Late in 1999, Roehrig formed a partnership with trainer Bob Kersee and his wife Jackie Joyner-Kersee to field a Winston Cup team for the 2000 season. The effort, known as Joyner-Kersee-Roehrig Motorsports, made its only appearance at the 2000 Bud Shootout, running the #34 Chevrolet with David Green driving and Kendall Motor Oil and Sunoco sponsoring, finishing twelfth. Green and the team were entered in the 2000 Daytona 500 but withdrew their entry after time trials, and after the team was unable to find sponsorship, did not make an appearance in Winston Cup again. = Craftsman Truck Series =  Truck #18 History  Roehrig Motorsports debuted in the inaugural Craftsman Truck Series race, the 1995 Copper World Classic. Johnny Benson qualified the #18 Hella Lights/Performance Friction Chevrolet C/K fourth and finished tenth. Benson made six more starts that season with Performance Friction sponsorship, his best being a second at Indianapolis Raceway Park. Wally Dallenbach, Jr. and Davy Jones made starts at Sonoma and Heartland Park Topeka, respectively, with Dallenbach finishing second in his lone start. Roehrig made another attempt at a part-time schedule with the #18 in 1996, starting with Benson who brought along Pennzoil sponsorship and finished in the top ten in all four of his starts, winning one pole. Along with Benson, David Green, Steve Park, and Robby Gordon all made a series of one-off starts in the truck, with Park and Gordon each earning a top-ten finish. In 1997. Roehrig attempted a full-time schedule in the #18 with Michael Dokken driving with sponsorship from Dana Corporation. Despite a pole position early in the season and two top-five finishes, Dokken struggled with consistency and was released midway through the season. He was replaced with a rotation of replacement drivers including Tom Hubert, Kevin Cywniski, Ted Christopher, and Jerry Marquis along with Benson and Gordon. Hubert recorded the highest finish of the year with a 2nd place finish at Sonoma Raceway. The #18 team did not return for 1998.  Truck #19 History  Roehrig Motorsports debuted the #19 Dodge Ram in 1997 with rookie Tony Raines and sponsorship from Pennzoil. After failing to qualify for two of the first four races, Raines won his first career race at I-70 Speedway and had seven top-ten finishes, ending the season fifteenth in the championship standings and third in the Rookie of the Year competition. The team switched to Ford in 1998, and Raines won three additional races and finished a career-best fifth in points. Following the team's decision to focus on its Winston Cup operation, the Craftsman Truck team closed its doors.

The cocaine later went missing in police possession after a subpoena was issued. West was on parole at the time of this incident with an extensive criminal record including assault, resisting arrest, and attempted first-degree murder. West ultimately died during the scuffle with police and various medical experts have given conflicting assessments of contributing factors including cardiac arrhythmia, dehydration, positional asphyxia, and extreme environmental temperatures. The incident fueled tension in the North Baltimore community, playing a contributing factor in the eventual Baltimore riots of 2015. The death of West drew attention from notable African American leaders including U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, and celebrity Charles Barkley. Three separate investigations, both internal and external, repeatedly exonerated the officers involved, but a series of police actions were identified that negatively impacted the encounter. The incident, and subsequent recommendations made by an independent panel, encouraged the police department to make significant procedural changes. Background =Tyrone West= Tyrone Antonio West was born on May 22, 1969, to Phillip West and Shirley Anderson at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He was raised by his aunt Diane Butler and his uncle Clifton Anderson. West was a talented artist and fitness buff in good physical condition, standing six feet tall and weighing 237 pounds. He was known by the nickname Weeda, described by family as an avid baseball fan with three children and two grandchildren. The criminal history of Tyrone West dates back to 1991, with prior convictions of assault, battery, use of a deadly weapon with intent to injure, and handgun and drug violations. Notably, West had three previous convictions for resisting arrest, was charged with attempted first-degree murder in 1999, and had prosecutors drop additional charges in another attempted murder case. After convictions for assault and drug distribution in 2000, West spent twelve years in prison before being released on parole during the summer of 2012. He was living at 2413 Guilford Avenue in North Baltimore during the summer of 2013. =Police officers= Ten Baltimore Police officers and two Morgan State University officers of white, black, and Hispanic descent were eventually on scene during the arrest and death of Tyrone West. Eight of the ten Baltimore police officers were investigated including Derrick Dewayne Beasley, Jorge Omar Bernardez-Ruiz, Nicholas David Chapman, Matthew Rea Cioffi, Alex Ryan Hashagen, Eric Maurice Hinton, Latreese Nicole Lee, and Danielle Angela Lewis. Additionally, David Lewis was investigated, one of the two Morgan State University patrolmen who responded. Seventeen days prior, on July 1, 2013, Nicholas Chapman and Jorge Omar Bernardez-Ruiz allegedly used excessive force to subdue a man named Abdul- Jaami Salaam during a traffic stop in Baltimore. Salaam was eventually awarded $70,000 in damages on March 29, 2016, in the resulting civil suit against Chapman, Bernardez-Ruiz, and a cohort. Chapman was also involved in a $147,000 settlement in an excessive force lawsuit after a jury found in favor of two men - Leo and James Green, who filed suit against five officers, including Chapman, for battery and false arrest after a traffic stop on June 13, 2013, eighteen days prior to the assault on Abdul Sallaam and thirty-five days prior to the death of Mr. West. Attempted arrest and death =Initial encounter= Baltimore temperatures on July 18, 2013, were well above normal with a high of 97¬∞ F (36¬∞ C), humidity as high as 87%, and a heat index of at least 105.5¬∞ F (41¬∞ C). West borrowed a 1999 Mercedes-Benz owned by his sister, school teacher Tawanda Jones, when an acquaintance named Cortinthea Servance contacted him for a ride. West was described as an unlicensed cab driver who provided transportation to neighborhood residents. Servance met him at the intersection of Loch Raven Boulevard and Winston Avenue in the North Baltimore neighborhood of New Northwood. They drove four-tenths of a mile to the intersection of Kitmore Road and Northwood Drive to eat the boxes of chicken West had picked up. After a few minutes, Servance asked West to back up in the intersection and turn east on Kitmore Road, deciding to return to her mother's house on Kitmore. They were passed by officers Chapman and Bernardez-Ruiz driving an unmarked police vehicle wearing ballistic vests and BPD badges but not in uniform, all according to standard protocol for the Northeast Operations Unit. They observed a dark green Mercedes unsafely backing into an intersection and turning eastbound on Kitmore Road at which point they turned around and began to follow the car. The officers recall the Mercedes accelerating well above the speed limit, while Servance maintains West proceeded slowly while balancing the chicken box in his lap. The driver and passenger reportedly made suspicious movements inside the car after making eye contact with the police. =Traffic stop and attempted arrest= The cars had proceeded one block east of Northwood Drive on Kitmore Road when the officers initiated a traffic stop at 7:13 p.m., citing suspicious behavior and backing into an intersection. West turned south on Kelway Road and stopped the car adjacent to 1365 Kitmore Road. The temperature remained around 91¬∞ F (33¬∞ C) with a heat index of 102.9¬∞ F (39¬∞ C) and 61% humidity. Both officers approached and asked if the occupants were carrying drugs, asking them to step out of the car at which point Servance refused. Police requested a female officer to search Servance and both suspects were placed on the curb while the car was searched. During questioning, police claimed to notice a bulge in West's sock, discovering a bag of cocaine when West shoved Officer Bernardez- Ruiz backward. Possession of cocaine would have been in violation of his parole and would have likely resulted in an eight-year prison sentence. Investigators later claimed to have found 13 bags of cocaine in the car totaling roughly a gram. Only a couple of witnesses agreed to be interviewed, but they all concurred that West initiated the fight. The suspect punched Bernardez-Ruiz who placed West in a bear hug. Officer Chapman joined the fracas but West was too strong to be restrained. Tyrone West fled northwest across Kitmore Road when Chapman contacted dispatch with an officer-in- distress call. West was wrestled to the ground by both officers near an alleyway. Witnesses including Servance stated West kept getting up and resisting, still punching and kicking officers. Repeatedly, West would seemingly comply with officers, only to resume punching, kicking, and pushing. A witness claimed that police used a taser on West when he failed to comply, but evidence verified that no taser was ever used. Officers deployed Oleoresin Capsicum Spray and Chapman struck West in the thigh with a baton, but he seemed unfazed. Police were incapacitated by the spray and West escaped their grasp before they could handcuff him. Bernardez-Ruiz verbally stated to let him go when West attacked them a fourth time before fleeing in the direction of his sister's Mercedes, eventually tackled on the sidewalk in front of 1365 Kitmore Road. After a second and third distress call, five backup officers finally arrived on scene, at least three of whom were black. Two Morgan State University policemen, Officer David Lewis and his partner, were the first backup to arrive, coming from campus one mile away. They were closely followed by a Baltimore police car driven by trainee Danielle Lewis with fellow officers Latreese Nicole Lee and Matthew Cioffi. The Morgan State officer arriving eastbound on Kitmore Road stopped his vehicle at the scuffle just prior to the intersection with Kelway Road when he was rear-ended by Lewis. Bernardez-Ruiz and Chapman were exhausted and suffering from the effects of the pepper spray, now retreating while backup officers attempted to control West still fighting and kicking. A witness recalled seeing West and Morgan State Officer Lewis punching each other before West was tackled and pepper sprayed. Two more Baltimore officers arrived, bringing the police presence to nine, while a police helicopter arrived overhead. West was finally subdued and four officers departed the melee to speak with three arriving officers, twelve policemen now present including Derrick Beasley, Alex Hashagen, and Eric Hinton. Only six officers were actually involved in restraining West. =Death= One witness, who asked not to be identified, reported seeing officers strike West with batons and kick his back and head. A Baltimore officer thought he saw Morgan State Officer Lewis with his knees across West's back, telling him not to do that, but other officers dispute that ever happening. West was in handcuffs when he appeared to experience a medical episode with labored breathing, so Chapman immediately radioed for medical help. As supervising Officer Corey Jennings arrived to find West unresponsive, he removed his handcuffs, turned him over, and immediately started CPR. EMT personnel arrived within five minutes and CPR was performed for about 20 minutes. Continuing lifesaving measures, they transported West to Good Samaritan Hospital where he was eventually pronounced dead at 8:11 p.m. Tyrone's younger sister Tawanda Jones recalls feeling a sharp pain on the right side of her neck at precisely 7:00 p.m. similar to the effect that twins claim to experience. The pain and resulting numbness subsided ten minutes later when she immediately told her fianc√© that she felt like something had happened to her brother. When the local news ran the story at 10:00 p.m. that evening, Jones and family recognized Tyrone's body before they were notified by law enforcement. Investigation =Autopsy= An autopsy was performed the following day at 9:00 a.m. at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Maryland. Chief medical examiner David Fowler determined that West died of cardiac arrhythmia when his heart suddenly stopped beating exacerbated by dehydration, a heart condition, and excessively high temperatures. Neither asphyxia nor trauma from the fight were found to be causes of death. Additionally, West's urine tested positive for cocaine. The medical examiner declined to release the results of the autopsy, even to the family, citing the incomplete and ongoing criminal investigation. Six months later at a press conference on December 10, 2013, the autopsy results were finally announced. =Internal investigation= Mayor Rawlings-Blake stated, ‚ÄúI have charged the Baltimore Police Department to conduct an internal investigation in an effort to further evaluate details surrounding this case and to hold anyone found of any wrongdoing accountable for their actions.‚Äù Eight city officers were suspended during dual investigations, an internal review by the police and a separate review by the State's Attorney's Office. Following routine guidelines, they were restricted to administrative assignments pending the outcome of the investigation. In December 2013, city prosecutors concluded there was not enough evidence to file criminal charges against any of the officers. The State's Attorney's Office concluded that the use of batons, pepper spray, and physical force were justified in subduing West. State's Attorney Gregg L. Bernstein stated, ‚ÄúMr. West ignored repeated verbal commands by the officers and fought with them over an extended period of time.‚Äù Cell phone video turned over by a witness verified that West was continually resisting arrest. City police hired an independent commission to conduct a third review that also confirmed the officers‚Äô innocence. Impact =Family reaction= Every Wednesday since the death of Tyrone West on Thursday, July 18, 2013, his sister Tawanda Jones has led family members and supporters in weekly demonstration to keep the spotlight on her brother. Beginning on Wednesday, July 24, 2013, a prayer vigil was held by the community at the intersection, the weekly gathering continuing to the present time under the name West Wednesdays. The family of West alleged that some of the officers in the case were also present during the death of Anthony Anderson on September 21, 2012, a Baltimore resident who died during a police encounter, but none of the officers were actually involved. On June 23, 2014, the family of Tyrone West filed a multimillion-dollar federal lawsuit against 11 officers, the city of Baltimore's police commissioner Anthony W. Batts, and the police chief at Morgan State University. They cited assault, violation of civil rights, and wrongful death. =Changes in police procedure= At the conclusion of their internal investigation, the Baltimore Police stated, ‚ÄúWhile the criminal review of this difficult situation comes to an end, the internal evaluation of our tactics continues as we seek ways to improve.‚Äù Influenced by the deaths of Anthony Anderson in 2012 and Tyrone West in 2013, the police department created a reform model to improve training and the investigation of in-custody deaths. The case also influenced change in department policy including limiting physical exertion during heat warnings, placing suspects in a sitting position after being handcuffed, and the use of tasers to subdue subjects with non-lethal force. Plainclothes officers patrolling North Baltimore were discontinued and police in uniform with much greater experience and minimum requirements were recruited to patrol. =Independent investigation= In 2014, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake commissioned another review of the case. The independent review board was chaired by James K. Stewart and five doctors. They unanimously determined in August 2014 that West died suddenly while engaged in an extended period of resisting a lawful arrest, that excessive force was not used and did not contribute to the death of Tyrone West, but that officers did not completely follow protocol. The board concluded that West died of cardiac arrhythmia due to cardiac conduction system abnormality aggravated by his struggle with police and dehydration during his restraint. The extreme environmental temperatures and heat index in the low 100s were also cited as a potential factor. The board also made 34 recommendations to improve training and officer accountability within the Baltimore Police Department. The panel determined that police did not follow basic policies and made tactical errors that potentially worsened the situation, including a lack of respect for motorists who are stopped in the neighborhood. The review identified the initial departure from protocol as the moment Chapman left his partner alone before backup arrived to begin lawfully searching the vehicle. Additionally, the pepper spray that incapacitated the officers should have been deployed when the suspect was at least three feet away, rather than in close proximity. =Ensuing protests= The friction between the Baltimore Police Department and inner-city Baltimore residents was finally thrust into the national spotlight with the death of Freddie Gray in April 2015. The growing tension in Baltimore, influence by the death of Tyrone West and more directly by Freddie Gray, bubbled over in 2015 resulting in demonstrations and rioting. The death of Freddie Gray prompted the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the police department, determining in a report on August 10, 2016, that there existed cases of excessive use of force, unlawful arrests, and discrimination against African Americans. Tawanda Jones eventually met with the family of Freddie Gray and Attorney General Loretta Lynch who promised to look into the Tyrone West case. Controversy =Second autopsy= In 2015, the West family attorney Dwight Petit hired Dr. William Manion to conduct an independent forensic investigation of Tyrone West's autopsy. Manion, the chief of pathology at Memorial Hospital in Salem County, New Jersey, concluded that he died by suffocation as a result of the way police restrained him, calling it positional asphyxia. This contradicted earlier assertions that he died of a heart condition. Dr. Manion acknowledged the cardiac abnormality but did not believe it contributed to the death of West, submitting his findings in November 2015. =State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs office response= In 2013, Assistant State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby defeated State's Attorney Gregg L. Bernstein, winning the election over the attorney who failed to bring charges in the West case. Mosby was heralded as a champion for change after bringing charges against officers in the Freddie Gray case in 2015. On April 14, 2016, Mosby announced she would not reopen the investigation into the death of Tyrone West citing there is no additional evidence to contradict the previous findings. Mosby personally called Tawanda Jones to deliver the news. After three separate investigations confirmed the innocence of the officers involved, State's Attorney's spokeswoman Rochelle Ritchie announced that the case would not be reopened. =Third autopsy= Another independent autopsy was conducted in June 2016 by Adel Shaker, a former medical examiner in Alabama and Mississippi, Shaker also concluded that death was caused by positional asphyxia, suffocation from being restrained in a prone position. =Missing evidence= The drugs confiscated from the car driven by Tyrone West have been lost by the Baltimore Police Department. The evidence was discovered missing when attorneys for the West family subpoenaed the department to inspect the cocaine recovered at the scene, only to find it had disappeared. =National television= The case of Tyrone West gained national notoriety when his family appeared in the opening episode of the television series American Race. They confronted the show's host, ex-NBA star Charles Barkley, who has frequently expressed support for both the black community and urban police departments while hoping for both to work together.

Overview  Arrhenius plots, which are used to represent the effects of temperature on the rates of chemical and biophysical processes and on various transport phenomena in materials science, may exhibit deviations from linearity. Account of curvature is provided here by a formula, which involves a deformation of the exponential function, of the kind recently encountered in treatments of non-extensivity in statistical mechanics.  Theoretical model  Svante Arrhenius (1889) equation is often used to characterize the effect of temperature on the rates of chemical reactions.S. Arrhenius, Z. Phys. Chem. 1889, 4, 226. The Arrhenius formula gave a simple and powerful law, which in a vast generality of cases describes the dependence on absolute temperature T of the rate constant as following, k(T)=Ae^{-E_{o}/RT} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad (1) where T is the absolute temperature, R is the gas constant and the factor A varies only slightly with temperature. The meaning attached to the energy of activation E_o is as the minimum energy, which molecules need have to overcome the threshold to reaction. Therefore, the year 1889 can be considered as the birth date of reactive dynamics as the study of the motion of atoms and molecules in a reactive event. Eq. (1) was motivated by the 1884 discovery by van't Hoff J. H. van't Hoff, 1884 in his book √âtudes de Dynamique chimique. of the exponential dependence from the temperature of the equilibrium constants for most reactions: Eq.(1), when used for both a reaction and its inverse, agrees with van't Hoff's equation interpreting chemical equilibrium as dynamical at the microscopic level. In case of a single rate-limited thermally activated process, an Arrhenius plot gives a straight line, from which the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor can both be determined. However, advances in experimental and theoretical methods have revealed the existence of deviation from Arrhenius behavior (Fig.1). Fig.1 Arrhenius plot as a function of d parameter. The Arrhenius plot concavity is depending on the value of the d parameter. To overcome this problem, Aquilanti and Mundim proposed (2010) a generalized Arrhenius law based on algebraic deformation of the usual exponential function. Starting from the EulerL. Euler, Introductio in analysin infinitorum, Lugduni: Apud Bernuset, Delamolliere, Falque & soc., Editio nova., 1797. exponential definition given by, e^{x}= \\\\lim_{n \\\\to +\\\\infty}(1+\\\\frac{x}{n})^{n} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad (2) defining the deformed exponential function as, e^{x}_{d}\\\\equiv\\\\left ( 1+dx \\\\right )^{1/d} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad (3) Identifying the deformation parameter d as a continuous generalization of \\\\frac{1}{n} . At the limit d\\\\rightarrow 0 the d-exponential function, e^{x}_{d}, coincides with the usual exponential according to the well-known limit due to Euler, that is, \\\\lim_{d \\\\to 0}{e^{x}_{d}}=e^{x} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad (4) This definition was first used in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics by Landau.E. M. Landau, L. D.; Lifshitz, Statistal Physics, Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann, 1951. In the most recent scientific literature, there is a variety of deformed algebras with applications in different areas of science. Considering the d-exponential function, we introduce the deformed reaction rate coefficient, k_{d}(T), in the following way, k_{d}(T)=Ae^{-\\\\frac{E_o}{RT}}_{d}=A\\\\left ( 1-d\\\\frac{E_o}{RT} \\\\right )^{1/d} (5) Fig.1a Aquilanti-Mundim plot as a function of d parameter. At the limit d\\\\rightarrow 0 the usual Arrhenius Plot is recovered. At d=0 is Usual Arrhenius, d<0 is concave and at d>0 convex plot. and at the limit d\\\\rightarrow 0 the usual Arrhenius reaction law is recovered (Figs.1 and 1a). A is pre-exponential factor. Taking the logarithm of k_{d}(T), Eq.(5), we obtain the following expression for the non-Arrhenius plot, \\\\ln k_{d}(T)=\\\\ln{A}+\\\\frac{1}{d}\\\\ln \\\\left ( 1-d\\\\frac{E_o}{RT} \\\\right ) (6) The logarithm of the reaction rate coefficient against reciprocal temperature shows a curvature, rather than the straight-line behavior described by the usual Arrhenius law (Figs.1 and 1a). In Tolman‚Äôs definition the barrier or activation energy is a phenomenological quantity defined in terms of the slope of an Arrhenius law; it is usually assumed to be independent of absolute temperature (T), requires only local equilibrium and in general is given by E_{o}=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial ln k(T) }{\\\\partial (\\\\frac{1}{RT}) } (7) where E_{o} is constant and R is the ideal gas constant. To generalize Tolman¬¥s definition, in the case chemical reactions, we assume that the barrier or activation energy is a function of the temperature given by the following differential equation, E_{a}=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial ln k_{d}(T) }{\\\\partial (\\\\frac{1}{RT}) }=E_{o}\\\\left ( 1-d\\\\frac{E_o}{RT} \\\\right )^{-1} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad or -\\\\frac{1}{E_a}=\\\\frac{1}{E_0}-\\\\frac{d}{RT} (8) where E_{a}=E_{o} (constant) at limit d\\\\rightarrow 0 and the usual activation energy law is recovered as a constant. Noticeably, on the contrary of the usual Arrhenius case, the barrier or activation energy is temperature dependent and k_{d}(T) has different concavities depending on the value of the d parameter (see Figs.1 and 1a). Thus, a positive convexity means that E_{a} decreases with increasing temperature. This general result is explained by a new Tolman-like interpretation of the activation energy through Eq.(8). In the recent literature, it is possible to find different applications to verify the applicability of this new chemical reaction formalism K. C. Mundim and M. S. P. Mundim, Rev. Proc. Qu√≠micos. 2013, 14, 21. V. H. C. Silva, H. C. B. Oliveira and K. C. Mundim, Rev. Proc. Qu√≠micos. 2013, 14, 9. Fig.2 ‚Äì Reaction rate coefficient and activation energy equations, in both theories.  Apparent Reciprocal Activation Energy or Transitivity  E_{a} can be considered as temperature dependent. It was postulated as the basic expansion the reciprocal-activation reciprocal-temperature relationship, for which can provide a formal mathematical justification by Tolman Theorem. The E_{a}(T) function when written as the logarithmic derivative of the rate constants with respect to \\\\beta=\\\\frac{1}{RT}, Eq. (7), the concept to an activation energy represents an energetic obstacle to the progress of the reaction: therefore its reciprocal can be interpreted as a measure of the propensity for the reaction to proceed and defined as the specific transitivity (\\\\gamma) of the process: \\\\gamma(\\\\beta)=\\\\frac{1}{E_a(T)} (9) This notation emphasizes the fact that in general the transitivity can take a gamma of values, but not including abrupt changes e.g. in the mechanism or in the phases of reactants. If it is admit a Laurent expansion in a neighbourhood around a reference value, it is possible recover the Eqs. (6) and (8). What it is call the sub-Arrhenius behaviour would be accounted for traditionally by introducing a tunnelling parameter (\\\\kappa) in the conventional Transition-State-Theory. In the d-TST formulation, it is replace the factor \\\\kappa.\\\\exp(-E_o\\\\beta) in the TST rate constant by the deformed exponential function, Eq. (3), yielding: k_{d-TST}=\\\\frac{k_BT}{h}\\\\frac{Q^\\\\ddagger}{Q_r}( 1-dE_o\\\\beta)^{1/d} (10) where h is Planck constant, k_Bis Boltzmann constant and Q_r is the (translational, vibrational and rotational) partition functions of the reactants, and Q^\\\\ddaggeris the partition function of the activated complex. In Ref., the significance of the parameter d and an explicit procedure for its calculation were proposed, which it is inversely proportional to the square of the barrier height (E_o)and directly proportional to the square of the frequency for crossing the barrier ( u^\\\\ddagger) at a saddle point in the potential energy surface: d=-\\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\left ( \\\\frac{h u^\\\\ddagger}{2E_o} \\\\right )^2 (11)  Fields of Applications and Related Subjects  This theory was initially developed for applications in chemical kinetics problems as above discussed, but has since been applied to a wide range of phenomena: * the characterization of reaction rates in Chemistry, * Transition State Theory (TST), * Astrochemical process, * quantum tunneling, * stereodynamics stereochemistry of kinetics processes, solid-state diffusive reactions, * physical processes in supercooled liquids, * carbon nanotubes composite, * transport phenomena, * anomalous diffusion, * Brownian particles moving, * transport dynamics in ionic conductors, * a continuum approach for modeling gravitational effects on grain settling and shape distortion, * collision theory, * rate theory connecting kinetics to thermodynamics, * nonextensive statistical mechanics, * different fields of plasma chemical-physics, * modelling of high-temperature dark current in multi-quantum well structures from MWIR to VLWI, * molecular semiconductor problems, * Metallurgy: perspectives on lubricant additive corrosion, * Langevin stochastic dynamics, * predicting solubility of solids in supercritical solvents, * survey on operational perishables (food) quality control and logistics, * activation energy‚Äôs on biodiesel reaction, * flux over population analysis, * molecular quantum mechanics, * biological activity, * drug design, * protein folding.

Maintaining studios in Paris and Vienna, Czedekowski would spend a long career portraying high society on both sides of the Atlantic.  Life  He was born on 22 February 1885, in Wojni≈Ç√≥w, a town in Galicia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, under Kazimierz Pochwalski and Heinrich von Angeli. During his time in the Austrian capital, he was bestowed with various prizes for academic merit, winning the prestigious 'F√ºger Medal' in his second year. He would graduate in 1907, but would remain a further four years at the academy. In 1913, he married Eugenie Nell, who gave birth to their first daughter, Helene, in 1914. A year later he would join the army as a soldier, only to become a military artist shortly after. He painted the Emperor Charles I in 1917 and exhibited at the War Exhibition of Austrian Painters and Sculptors in 1920. The period after the First World War, saw Czedekowski gain prominence as a portrait painter. In 1920, he and his family would move to the US, where a short but successful spell, announced himself to fashionable society on that side of the Atlantic. Returning to Europe a few years later, he would continue portraying high society from his studios in Paris and Vienna. In 1923, he visited an independent Poland for the first time. Towards the end of the 1920s Czedekowski's visits to Poland became increasingly frequent, by 1930 he was commissioned to paint the President Ignacy Moscicki. The portrait was well received and would encourage further commissions from the Polish elite: aristocrats, politicians, industrialists and clergymen all proved willing patrons for Czedekowski's paintbrush. Though constantly on the move, Czedekowski resided in Paris from 1923 to 1938; his rising reputation in that city, resulted in him being made a knight of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1934. In Warsaw at the outbreak of the Second World War, Czedekowski fled to Vienna, where he observed the occupation of Poland from afar. He was stirred profoundly by the horrors of War and produced a series of paintings entitled \\"The War in Poland.\\" His portrait of General George S. Patton Jr., painted at the end of the War, now hangs in the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C. Czedekowski emigrated to the US in 1946, experiencing some of his most successful years. He would exhibit frequently across numerous states, becoming an American Citizen in 1952. After the sudden death of his wife in 1953, he returned to Europe, married Hertha Aujezedecky and lived out the remainder of his days in Vienna. Continuing to visit his homeland, now behind the Iron Curtain, he exhibited in Cracow in 1964 and received the 'Order of Polonia Restituta' at the Palace of Culture in Warsaw. Though overwhelmingly a painter of portraits, he painted a selection of landscapes whilst holidaying in Salzburg in his final years. He exhibited for a final time with the International Artist's Club at the Palais Palffy in Vienna at the beginning of 1965. Jan Boles≈Çaw Czedekowski died in Vienna on 8 July 1969. He was buried next to his first wife at their holiday home in Lofer, Salzburg.  Legacy  In 2002, his widow, Hertha, donated 11 oil paintings to the museum at Castle ≈Åa≈Ñcut. The museum later received two more paintings, as well as paperwork, sketches and photographs relating to the artist's life. The castle hopes to open a permanent exhibition, dedicated to Jan Boles≈Çaw Czedekowski.

Alonso (born March 18, 1959, in Madrid, Spain), is a physician, epidemiologist, and researcher in diseases that affect vulnerable populations. Based on a multidisciplinary approach, his work focuses mainly on malaria, although he has also studied other infectious diseases. Since 2014, he serves as the Director of the Global Malaria Programme at the World Health Organization.  Education and professional career  After obtaining his medical degree at the Autonomous University of Madrid in 1984, Pedro L. Alonso earned a Masters in Epidemiology and Control of Communicable Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He then obtained a PhD in Medicine in the University of Barcelona. He is also a specialist in Community Medicine and Public Health by the Spanish Ministry of Health. His professional career began in The Gambia in the 1980s. A study on the validation of verbal autopsies was followed by the scientific assessment of the efficacy of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) as a preventive tool against malaria. The utility of such nets was, at the time, controversial, and the publication of new results in The Lancet was critical for the launching of subsequent studies confirming first evaluations. Based on this evidence, WHO recommended the universal use of ITNs as a vector control tool, since a pillar in the fight against malaria. It is estimated that extensive distribution programs of ITNs can claim responsibility for 69% of the 663 million of averted malaria cases in Subsaharan Africa between 2001 and 2015. After a short stay at the Instituto de Parasitolog√≠a ‚ÄúL√≥pez Neyra‚Äù, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas, in Granada, Spain, Pedro L. Alonso settled in Barcelona in 1991 to head the Epidemiology & Biostatistics Unit at the Hospital Clinic, an institution to which he would remain linked for more than 20 years and where he created and directed the Center for International Health ‚Äìthe first of its kind in a Spanish university hospital. While in Barcelona, he promoted his first international collaborations, most notably with the Ifakara Health Institute (Tanzania), where along with Dr. Marcel Tanner, he worked in the evaluation of the malaria vaccine SPf66. In collaboration with Dr. Clara Men√©ndez, Pedro L. Alonso broadened his research field to include malaria prophylaxis in children under 1 year old, evaluation of new malaria control strategies such as intermittent treatment for children and pregnant women, etiology of anemia, and the study of further causes of death and disease in African children including acute respiratory diseases and diarrheas. With the support of the Hospital Cl√≠nic and the University of Barcelona, he founded in 2006 the Barcelona Centre for International Health Research (CRESIB). In this institution he accomplished one of his most renowned works, the contribution to the clinical development and impact assessment of a new malaria vaccine: RTS,S. In collaboration with the Manhi√ßa Health Research Centre in Mozambique, he implemented two proofs of concept that established for the first time the efficacy of the vaccine in infants and children aged 1‚Äì4 years. These results opened the door to subsequent assessments and to a Phase 3 clinical trial performed in 11 African research centres. Ultimately, this vaccine received a positive assessment by the European Drugs Agency, in 2015, while the highest expert committees at WHO have recommended that it starts to be utilized, as of 2018, in pilot programs in three African countries. Apart from his own activities as scientific researcher, Pedro L. Alonso has devoted considerable efforts to facilitate the development of research capacities in Africa, as well as to training new generations of scientists both in Spain and in developing countries. He has directed 24 doctoral dissertations in a variety of fields ranging from basic biology, epidemiology, evaluation of new interventions or clinical development of drugs and vaccines for respiratory and diarrheal diseases, HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. In regard to the creation of institutions, the foundation of the Manhi√ßa Health Research Centre (CISM) in Mozambique is of particular importance. Launched in 1996 in the context of cooperation agreements between Mozambique and Spain, CISM receives funds from the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation. Pedro L. Alonso was CISM scientific director from 1996 to 2008, year in which the ownership of the centre was trespassed to a fully Mozambican institution: Funda√ßao Manhi√ßa. For several years, CISM stood as the only African centre with a demographic surveillance system and pioneered broad clinical studies in Africa. CISM was distinguished in 2008 with the Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias Award for International Cooperation, with three other African institutions. This same line of work prompted the foundation of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), for which he also served as the first general director. ISGlobal aims to break the vicious circle of poverty and disease with an integrated approach that extracts and implements knowledge through its areas of Training, Policy, and Global Development. At an international level, Pedro L. Alonso participated, together with Dr. Fred Binka, in the creation of the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trial Partnership, a joint endeavor by European and African countries with the objective of promoting and funding the development of new tools against malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. As a result of a paradigm shift that makes of malaria eradication a shared objective by the international community, Pedro L. Alonso led, jointly with Dr. Marcel Tanner, the Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) initiative that defined research and future development needs for malaria eradication. Results of malERA were published in 2011 in PLoS Medicine and led to the creation of the Malaria Eradication Scientific Alliance (MESA). Beyond the malaria field, Pedro L. Alonso, Ciro de Quadros, and Christopher Elias led the Committee that developed the Global Vaccine Action Plan, approved by the World Health Assembly in 2012. Dr. Alonso has been a member of numerous expert committees at WHO, the European Union, Medicines for Malaria Venture, TDR or the Spanish Ministry of Health, among others.  Current position  Since October 2014, Pedro L. Alonso is the Director of the Global Malaria Programme at the WHO, and is responsible for coordinating efforts to control and eliminate malaria and establish norms, technical guidelines and policies to support countries affected by this disease.  Publications and awards  Pedro L. Alonso is included in the \\"top 20\\" list of most cited authors in the malaria field and also is on list of the 50 most influential people in the vaccines field. Throughout his career, he has published more than 350 articles and has received, among other awards, the Gran Cruz de la Orden Civil de Sanidad (Ministry of Health, Madrid, Spain), the Red Cross and Red Crescent Golden Medal (Barcelona, Spain), the Josep Trueta medal (Generalitat of Catalonia), the Balmis award (Ministry of Defense, Madrid, Spain), the Ronald Ross Medal (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK), the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award (Spain), and the Carlos IV award (Royal National Academy of Medicine, Spain). He is an International Honorary Fellow of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Since 2008, Pedro L. Alonso is Professor of International Health at the University of Barcelona and has been awarded Doctor Honoris Causa by the Universidad Europea de Madrid and the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos  Personal life  Pedro L. Alonso is married to Clara Men√©ndez, a researcher expert in malaria in pregnancy. They have three children, Yara, Miguel and Sof√≠a.

Despite their name, these systems did not employ radio transmitters, but were actually a type of \\"telephone newspaper\\", because the programs were sent telephonically over wires strung to subscribing homes. The equipment used to distribute programming over a facility's wire network was located at a central site, for example a general store's back room. Programs normally consisted of retransmissions of radio stations, however, some programming was locally produced, originating from a studio at the distribution site or relayed from a local church or other gathering place. The locally produced programs included announcements and emergency messages, commercials and live performances. The transmissions were made daily, generally starting around 6 a.m. and running until 10:00 p.m. or midnight. The grapevine systems soon became unneeded, because they primarily served homes that did not have electricity. Once a community received electric service the local grapevine system would soon close down, as the subscribers switched to radio receivers that could receive a wide selection of programs at no cost, instead of the single program and monthly fees characteristic of the grapevine systems. Historical background Information about the grapevine installations (also called \\"speakerline\\") is limited, because of their brief history and the fact that they do not appear to have been established outside a small region of South Carolina. Unlike radio stations, they did not require government approval to operate. Their existence was also dependent on an unusual and short-lived economic and technical environment, as they required a central distribution site that had access to electricity, plus a surrounding community of prospective subscribers that did not have electric service. Throughout the 1930s large parts of the United States, including most farms, did not have electricity. Although organized radio broadcasting had begun in the early 1920s, in rural upstate South Carolina there were no nearby radio stations strong enough to be picked up by battery-less crystal radio receivers, and although battery-powered sets existed, without electrical service there was no convenient way to recharge the batteries. The economic struggles caused by the Great Depression meant that many people could not even afford a newspaper subscription. Thus, there was a lack of entertainment and a strong sense of isolation in the region.\\"The Development of Rural Wired Radio Systems in Upstate South Carolina\\" by Susan K. Opt, Journal of Radio Studies 1 (1992), pages 73-74. (academia.edu) As one person remembered, connecting to the grapevine service meant that \\"we had 'arrived' and were at last in touch with the outside world\\".Listening to Radio, 1920-1950 by Ray Barfield, 1996, page 55. The rural electrification projects of the 1930s and 1940s eventually eliminated potential customers, making the grapevine systems no longer needed as their former customers switched to listening to radio stations. Initial installation at Mauldin Wire layout of Gordon Rogers' \\"grapevine radio\\" installation as of 1936. The transmissions originated from his home near Mauldin, South Carolina. The first grapevine system was begun in the winter of 1930-1931 by a high school student, Gordon F. Rogers, who lived on farm in central Greenville county near Mauldin, South Carolina. The Rogers farm, unlike most of its neighbors, had electrical service. Gordon Rogers had shown an early aptitude for engineering, developing a clock that automatically turned on the farm's chicken coup lights at 3:00 a.m., as well as an automated system for watering the chickens.\\"Yen for Electricity Takes SC Country Boy a Long Way: The Gordon Rogers Story\\", The (Columbia, South Carolina) State, April 22, 1952, page 11-A. Rogers also had an early interest in radio. Dissatisfied with a battery operated set, he successfully reconditioned a vacuum tube receiver that ran on AC electrical power. At this point he decided to also run a single-wire connection with a ground return from his receiver to a loudspeaker at the home of a neighbor who didn't have electricity. With this setup, whenever Rogers' radio was on the neighbor also heard what was being received. Word of this innovation quickly spread, and within a month lines had been run to seven nearby homes.\\"Bringing Radio to the Rural Home\\" by G. F. Rogers, RCA Engineer, July/August 1980 (Vol. 26, No. 1), pages 69-71. (worldradiohistory.com) Rogers' system was essentially sending one-way telephone signals over his own wires, but he had to use voltages far higher than that used by standard telephone lines, because he was sending not only audio but also the power needed to operate what would become hundreds of loudspeakers. His initial setup output was 2.5 watts, but as the system expanded this was increased in steps over time to 350-400 watts.Ibid. This occasionally led to issues when his wires ran too close to standard telephone lines, which sometimes picked up the strong grapevine transmissions. Special steps had to be taken to eliminate interference with the telephone company's service.Rogers (1980) page 73. Subscribers had to provide the wire, poles (often actually fence posts) and speakers needed to connect to the main system lines. Unskilled attempts by individuals to tap into the lines without paying generally caused service disruptions for nearby customers, which made it possible to locate and remove the improper connections. Although at first the service was provided for free, as the number of participants grew Rogers began charging a monthly 10 cent fee.Opt (1992) page 75. This charge was later raised to 25 cents, and at times a $1 surcharge was applied to finance replacement of sections of the transmission lines that needed to be upgraded from the original iron wire to higher quality materials. The system became profitable enough to finance Rogers' attendance at Clemson College. In 1933, at the time of his college enrollment, the system had 5 miles (8 kilometers) of lines and 15 subscribers. Increasing demand, spurred by finding a source of affordable speakers ($2.85 each), expanded the number of connections to more than 200 within the next four months, and by June 1934 the transmission lines spanned 15 miles (24 kilometers). By around 1935, there were 600 homes connected to the grapevine service, including sites in Spartanburg and Laurens counties, located up to 24 miles (38 kilometers) distant from the Rogers farm distribution site. The infrastructure had also grown to 400 miles (645 kilometers) of transmission lines.Rogers (1980) pages 69-70. Programming was provided for about 12 hours each day. Rogers introduced a \\"local talent\\" program that featured live performances. A record player provided music for times when static made it difficult to receive the radio rebroadcasts that provided most of the schedule. Provisions were also made to make local announcements.Rogers (1980) page 71. In addition, a carrier current link from the system based at Ware Place allowed programming originating at that location to be picked up and concurrently transmitted by the Mauldin system.Opt (1992) page 76. In the spring of 1936, Rogers, now a junior at Clemson, presented a paper, \\"Bringing Radio to the Rural Home\\", at a regional conference of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, which provided technical information about his innovation. His review won first place in its category.\\"Clemson Junior Contest Winner\\", The (Columbia, South Carolina) State, April 23, 1936, page 5. Rogers' paper was republished in the July/August 1980 issue of RCA Engineer magazine. The Mauldin-based system remained in operation until the area received electrical service, shutting down around 1939.Opt (1992) page 76. Additional installations =Ware Place= Gordon Rogers' original system served northern Greenville county. A second wire network, originating from a small store in Ware Place, South Carolina, was later established which provided an extensive program service for the southern part of the county. The store's owners, J. R. Chandler, Jr. and his cousin J. E. Chandler, became familiar with the Mauldin facility, and around 1934 arranged for Gordon Rogers and Sherman Fox to install similar distribution equipment at their store.Images of America: Fork Shoals, 2012, page 103. The Chandlers became active participants operating the system and supplying local programming. A studio, which included a piano and a pulpit, was built in the rear of the store. There was also a connection to the local school.\\"Augusta Road Life Livened by 'Grapevine'\\" by Hattie S. Sims, The Greenville (South Carolina) News, March 3, 1957, page 1-D. Subscribers were initially charged 25 cents a month, which was later increased to 35 cents. Individual homes had to maintain their local wire connections, and purchase their own speakers: $3 to $5 for a small one, and $7 to $8 for a large one. An unusual additional benefit resulted from the discovery that, after the grapevine programming ended for the night, individual subscribers could hear each other if they spoke loudly into their speakers, resulting in a form of party-line communication. At its peak over 500 homes were connected. The system continued to run during World War II in order to supply war news, after which it was shut down.Opt (1992) page 76. =Hickory Tavern= This installation helped launch the political career of Robert C. Wasson, who went on to become the state's Tax Chairman. The Wasson family ran a small store in Hickory Tavern, South Carolina, located in southwest Laurens county. The needed equipment was purchased in March 1936 and the service was immediately popular. Later that year, when Robert Wasson announced what would be a successful candidacy for the state House of Representatives, a newspaper report noted that the store he ran \\"is known as Wasson Brothers store, mill, and grapevine radio system serving 200 rural homes\\".\\"Robert C. Wasson Seeks House Seat\\", The (Columbia, South Carolina) State, July 8, 1936, page 2. Customers were charged 25 cents per month, and paid $6.50 for a small speaker or $10.50 for a large one ‚Äî this fee included installation. Robert Wasson's mother, Effie Owens Wasson, handled most of the operational duties, and at its peak about 500 houses within a 12 mile (19 kilometer) radius were connected. Regular news reports and live entertainment made up an important part of the daily schedule.Opt (1992) page 78. Advertising over the facility was credited with helping to establish the Eaddy-Blakes corner drug store in Laurens, and a former pharmacy employee later wrote that \\"were Dr. Eaddy still living I'm sure he would attribute the biggest thing to his success in the drug business was this advertising... It cost him about a dollar a week and he had every person from the area as a regular customer in a short time\\". \\"Grapevine Radio System\\" (letter from R. A. Martin), The Greenville (South Carolina) News, May 7, 1980, Section B, page 1. Robert Wasson served seven terms in the South Carolina legislature. One of his political objectives was getting electrical service for his community, and after the rural electrification program reached his district the grapevine service ceased operations in 1939.\\"'The Grapevine': A Radio Started Career in Politics\\" by Jonathan W. Oatis (AP), Greenwood (South Carolina) Index-Journal, August 11, 1980, page 20. =Saylors Crossroads= Saylors Crossroads, South Carolina is a small community located in southeastern Anderson county. This system was inspired by the existence of the Ware Place operations, and was established by Charles Murdock in 1937. The Murdock family operated a general store, and a small studio was constructed in a building behind the store. The grapevine service was run by Selma Saylors, who was the twin sister of Charles Murdock's wife. Programming primarily consisted of relaying the transmissions of a local radio station, WAIM in Anderson. WAIM signed off at 9 p.m. each evening, and at that point the program source was switched to picking up \\"a station in Cincinnati\\" (presumably WLW). Local programming included the Sunday morning church services from Mount Bethel Baptist Church, carried from 1938 to 1940. Subscribers paid 45 cents a month, and chose between three speaker sizes: a smaller square-shaped speaker for $7.50, a larger square-shaped speaker for $9.50, and a heart-shaped speaker for $12.50. The speaker purchases financed the installation of the wire connection to the main transmission lines. At its peak, the service had 500 subscribers. This system ended operations in 1941, after the community received electric service.Opt (1992) pages 76-77. =Williamston= This system was operated by Carl Ellison, who owned a general store located at Williamston, South Carolina in east central Anderson county. It remained in operation for \\"seven or eight years\\", starting sometime in the 1930s and continuing through at least 1940. It had also been initially inspired by the Ware Place operations. The Ellisons lived in a house behind the general store, and they converted their living room to serve as a studio for locally produced programming. The service cost 50 cents a month, and reached 700 subscribers. Like the Ware Place system, after the grapevine programming ended for the night individuals could be heard by other subscribers by speaking loudly into their speakers. The system featured ministers from Greenville who preached over the system on Friday nights. It also carried the Sunday services from the First Baptist Church in Williamston.Opt (1992) pages 77-78. =Other sites= Gordon Rogers estimated that a total of ten to twelve grapevine operations were eventually installed, all located in South Carolina. Additional locations reportedly included Walhalla (located in the center of South Carolina's easternmost county, Oconee), another \\"near Mauldin\\", and one \\"across the Savannah river from Augusta, Georgia\\".Opt (1992) page 74.

The NNSC works with communities to reduce violence, minimize arrest and incarceration, and increase trust between law enforcement and the public. Working in partnership with cities around the country the NNSC provides advising on implementing evidence-based violence reduction strategies. Additionally, the NNSC provides guidance on how to build trust between law enforcement and the communities it serves, facilitates connections between practitioners within and across jurisdictions, and serves as a resource for knowledge about violence prevention and reduction strategies.  History  The National Network for Safe Communities was founded as the Center for Crime Prevention and Control in 2005. In 2009 it was re-launched as the National Network for Safe Communities under the direction of David M. Kennedy and John Jay College President Jeremy Travis. The National Network's efforts are an outgrowth of the success of Operation Ceasefire, a Boston-based youth homicide intervention led by David M. Kennedy in the 1990s. Operation Ceasefire was responsible for a 63 percent reduction in youth homicide victimization and is now implemented in dozens of cities as the NNSC's Group Violence Intervention (GVI). The NNSC has used GVI's framework to develop strategies to address overt drug markets, intimate partner violence, prison violence, and individual gun violence. In 2014 the U.S. Department of Justice awarded a three-year $4.75 Million grant to create the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice (NI), and named the National Network as the lead organization. In 2016 the NNSC partnered with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to create the Institute for Innovation in Prosecution (IIP), which facilitates conversation among prosecutors across the nation. The NNSC has also begun to explore violence prevention work in an international context. The work of the National Network has been widely recognized and has been awarded for its strategies. The NNSC was awarded the Ford Foundation‚Äôs Innovations in American Government Award twice (in 1997 & 2007), and received the Webber Seavey Award given by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (in 1999 & 2008) twice. The NNSC also won the Herman Goldstein International Award for Problem Oriented Policing twice (in 1998 &2016) and was selected as a finalist on two other occasions (in 2006 & 2009).  Strategies  The NNSC uses focused deterrence and problem-oriented policing strategies to identify a particular serious crime problem and design a strategy to respond to it. The National Network‚Äôs process recognizes that a small minority of individuals drive the majority of serious violence, therefore law enforcement needs to employ a similarly concentrated response. The NNSC‚Äôs strategies rely on partnerships between law enforcement, community leaders, and social service providers to harness the power of social norms as a tool for crime prevention. The partnership then communicates directly and repeatedly with those individuals, giving them a moral message from the community against violence, the legal consequences of further offending, and an offer of help. Although the basic strategy doesn‚Äôt change, the NNSC works with cities to understand the context of violence in their communities and to design a site specific implementation plan. = Group Violence Intervention = The Group Violence Intervention (GVI) is designed to reduce street group-involved homicide and gun violence, and is an outgrowth of the work done by Operation Ceasefire in Boston in the 1990s. The aim of the GVI strategy is to reduce peer dynamics in the group that promote violence by creating collective accountability, to foster internal social pressure that deters violence, to establish clear community standards against violence, to offer group members an ‚Äúhonorable exit‚Äù from committing acts of violence, and to provide a supported path for those who want to change. = Drug Market Intervention = The Drug Market Intervention (DMI) effectively eliminates overt drug markets and improves life for residents of the surrounding communities. The DMI partnership brings together key stakeholders to make it clear that selling drugs openly must stop and the market is closed, that help is available, and that continued dealing will result in immediate sanctions through the activation of existing cases.Corsaro, Nicholas, Eleazer D Hunt, Natalie Kroovand Hipple, and Edmund F McGarrell. 2012. \\"The Impact of Drug Market Pulling Levers Policing on Neighborhood Violence: An Evaluation of the High Point Drug Market Intervention.\\" Criminology & Public Policy 11 (2): 167-201. = Intimate Partner Violence Intervention = The Intimate Partner Violence Intervention (IPVI) employs the National Network's approach to identify and deter the most serious domestic violence offenders, reduce domestic violence, and reduce harm to victims. Through a partnership between law enforcement, community members, social service providers, and domestic violence victims‚Äô advocates, the IPVI strategy intervenes early with low-level domestic violence offenders, puts them on notice of community intolerance for domestic violence and that further and more serious offending will be met with a meaningful legal response, and takes special steps to remove the most dangerous domestic violence offenders from the community. = Prison Violence Intervention = The Prison Violence Intervention (PVI) aims to enhance safety and security in prisons for both staff and inmates. The strategy uses the National Network's process to identify the institution's key players and target serious prison offenses such as assaults against staff, multi-inmate fights, and assaults with weapons.  Projects  https://trustandjustice.org/ = National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice = The National Initiative is a U.S. Department of Justice project led by the National Network for Safe Communities. The NNSC works alongside Yale Law School, the Center for Policing Equity, and the Urban Institute as principal partners. Launched in 2014, the National Initiative (NI) is designed to improve relationships and increase trust between minority communities and the criminal justice system. It seeks to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias (including implicit bias), and supports reconciliation between law enforcement and the communities it serves. The NI also aims to advance the public and scholarly understandings of the issues contributing to those relationships. The NI is currently working in Birmingham, Alabama; Ft. Worth, Texas; Gary, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Stockton, California. https://nnscommunities.org/our-work/iip = Institute for Innovation in Prosecution = The Institute for Innovation in Prosecution (IIP) is a partnership between the NNSC and the Manhattan District Attorney‚Äôs Office. The IIP blends academic rigor and prosecutorial action to form a new generation of thought in the field. The institute uses executive sessions, strategic advising, practitioner learning, and research & evaluation to inform prosecutors and build a more effective criminal justice system. Ultimately, the IIP seeks to enhance trust, improve transparency, and increase safety.

However, the waymarkers themselves, list the date as 926 AD (see photograph) as do some other sources. Speight maintains that the Liberty of Wilfrid was granted to the Holy See of York in 937 after Athelstan's victory over the 'Pagan' Danes. King Athelstan created the Sanctuary of Ripon by placing eight crosses on the roads approaching the city. Some of the crosses were given names; Cross of Athelstan, Kangel Cross and Sharow Cross. The sanctuary was known as the Liberty of St Wilfrid and was maintained by the ecclesiastical body in the city. The boundary waymarkers have all since been removed or destroyed except the remnants of the base of one of the crosses at Sharow, which is now a listed monument. The sanctuary lasted until 1540 when the authorities looking after law and order became secular.

It was expected to be released worldwide on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and Xbox One before it was delayed. Gameplay The Last Night is a 2.5D platform game, where the player controls Charly, a lower-class guy that is living in an \\"era of leisure\\" and where computers and machinery have otherwise taken over all menial work. The player can have Charly explore his city, and Charly can talk with other citizens, and includes elements of stealth. Development The basis of The Last Night came from a six-day cyberpunk-themed game jam that brothers Tim and Adrien Soret participated in June 2014. Their browser game of the same name won for the best overall game and best aesthetics out of 265 entries; the game VA-11 HALL-A also resulted from the same game jam. They described it as \\"Blade Runner + delicious pixels\\", with heavy inspiration from cinematic platformer Flashback (1992), along with Another World (1991) and Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee (1997). They used pixel art for the game jam, being the easiest to implement in a short amount of time, and starting with the styles set by Gods Will Be Watching and Sword & Sworcery as these games' characters with long, spindly legs were easier to animate. The brothers made the game jam version of their game available for free download at itch.io, allowing others to try it outside the game jam. Several outlets praised the title for its visuals that captured the atmosphere of Blade Runner and other cyberpunk works. At the time of the game jam, the brothers had been working on a fantasy, Studio Ghibli-inspired platformer called Behind Nowhere, but they've never finished the game, in fact there is only still frames faking the idea of it. They brought in a few additional team members to form their studio, Odd Tales, and develop The Last Night in full. Among changes was to create their own pixel art style. By October 2014, the Sorets had announced plans to release the game for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 with an anticipated 2016 release. In expanding their development, the team decided to create the game around the idea of Post- cyberpunk, in which the narrative focuses on a character \\"anchored in their society rather than adrift in it\\", a statement describing the genre made by Lawrence Person on Slashdot in 1998. Adrien, the younger brother, left the project in December 2016 to pursue his own career. In February 2017, Raw Fury announced it would help publish the title for Odd Tales. The game's first reveal was shown during Microsoft's presentation at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017 in June 2017, as an Xbox One console launch exclusive alongside the Microsoft Windows version. The game was expected to launch worldwide in 2018. However, at the end of 2018, Soret reported via Twitter that due to \\"massive business, legal & funding issues\\" that forced them to delay the game, to pull a planned trailer to be shown during The Game Awards 2018, and seek out additional funding support. Controversy Following the game's premiere during Microsoft's presentation at E3 2017, Tim Soret was noted to have previously posted statements around 2014 and since on social media that were seen as pro-Gamergate, and antifeminism. Coupled with the descriptors used within the game's marketing material, such as \\"second-class citizen\\" and \\"gamified existence\\" which were seen as aligned with these views, some took to Odd Tales and Raw Fury to have them stop publishing the game. Tim replied following this that his stance from his previous position has since changed, and that The Last Night was in no way meant to be commentary surrounding the Gamergate controversy. He apologized for his past tweets while on stage during the PC Gaming Show the next day, stating \\"They don‚Äôt in any way represent where I am today or what The Last Night will be about\\". Raw Fury supported Tim, stating: \\"The comments Tim made in 2014 are certainly surprising and don‚Äôt fit the person we know, and we hope that everyone reading this who knows us at Raw Fury on a personal and professional level knows that we wouldn‚Äôt tolerate working with someone who portrays the caricature of Tim going around the internet right now.\\" In an interview with Vice, Tim Soret said that while The Last Night has themes that others see as right-wing, such as criticizing the concept of Universal Basic Income, his goal with the game is not to be critical of these elements, but only to describe a world that took a certain trajectory to implement these elements, for better or worse, and explore the new problems that were introduced. Soret compared this approach to the movies Gattaca and Wall-E, neither of which he felt politicized the situation and further supported the belief that the tweets had been overblown by a few people trying to create a controversy to benefit themselves. The controversy around Soret and The Last Night led to the situation being called a \\"Milkshake Duck\\", a meme introduced about a year prior but that gained wider usage following this controversy.

The High Commission of India in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea is concurrently accredited to the Solomon Islands History Diplomatic relations between India and the Solomon Islands were established in May 1987. The Solomon Islands are a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, of which India is an official dialogue partner. Bilateral relations received a boost following the initiation of the Forum for India‚ÄìPacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) by the Narendra Modi government in 2014. India announced that it would provide a grant-in-aid of US$100,000 annually to each of the 14 Pacific Island countries, including the Solomon Islands, at the Post Forum Dialogue partner meeting in 2006. The amount was increased to US$125,000 annually from 2009. At the first FIPIC Summit on 19 November 2014, Prime Minister Modi announced numerous steps that India would take to improve relations with Pacific Island countries, including the Marshall Islands, such as easing visa policies, increase in grant-in-aid to Pacific Island Countries to $200,000 each annually, and several measures to boost bilateral trade and aid in the development of the Pacific Island countries. High level visits Solomon Islander Foreign Minister Laurie H. Chan visited New Delhi on 17‚Äì20 January 2005 and held bilateral talks with the Foreign Minister, Human Resource Development Minister, the Minister of State for Information Technology, and the Minister of State for Commerce & Industry. Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Trade Peter Shanel Agovaka visited New Delhi in February 2011 to participate in the ministerial meeting on \\"Harnessing the Positive Contribution of South-South Cooperation for Development of Least Developed Countries (LDCs)\\".

In his address to the gathering, Sogavare praised the 30-year bilateral relationship between the two countries. Trade Bilateral trade between India and the Solomon Islands totaled US$7.36 million in 2013‚Äì14. India exported $2.06 million worth of goods to the Solomon Islands, and imported $5.30 million. At the 2nd FIPIC Summit, Prime Minister Modi announced that a FIPIC Trade Office would be opened at the FICCI premises in New Delhi. The trade office, named the FIPIC Business Accelerator, was officially opened on 7 September 2015. The Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) has also established a dedicated department at its headquarters in New Delhi focusing on boosting trade with Pacific Island Countries. Indian firm Asian Paints operates a manufacturing in the Solomon Islands through its subsidiary, Asian Paints (SI) Ltd. Foreign aid In April 2007, India donated US$100,000 towards disaster relief and rehabilitation of tsunami victims in the Solomon Islands in April 2007. India also donated $50,000 towards disaster relief after floods in the Solomon Islands in March 2014. Citizens of the Soloman Islands are eligible for scholarships under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme.

She was the first Andalusian woman to be in charge of a Rectorate and only the fourth in Spain's history.  Career  Valpuesta was born in Seville, and began her university career at the Faculty of Law of the University of Seville, where she graduated in Law with the qualification of Sobresaliente (Outstanding) 1976. Subsequently, she got her PhD from the same university in 1980 with the highest qualification (\\"Cum laude\\"). Her doctoral dissertation, supervised by Prof. Dr. √Ångel M. L√≥pez y L√≥pez (a Professor of Civil Law at the same University), which was published, dealt with ‚ÄúLos pactos conyunturales de separaci√≥n de hecho: historia y presente‚Äù. Two years later, she became a senior lecturer at the University, and in 1989 she became a Professor of Civil Law at the Faculty of Social and Legal Sciences of Huelva (Spain), which at that time was part of the University of Seville. She later served as a Professor at the University of Huelva, from 1993 until 1997, at the University of Seville from 1997 until 1999, and finally at the Pablo de Olavide University from 1999 until 2013. Throughout all this time, Professor Valpuesta carried out an extensive research work, which resulted in the publication of several articles, text annotations, monographs, manuals and legal studies of all kinds. Her most important academic contributions were in the field of Family Law. Manuel Chaves (the former President of the Regional Government of Andalusia) appointed her as the Vice Chancellor of the Pablo de Olavide University (UPO) by statutory order on July 29, 1997. She renewed the position in April 2001, through elections; she occupied the position until June 10, 2003, when Agust√≠n Madrid replaced her. She arrived at the Pablo de Olavide University with experience in university management, since she had been the Vice-Chancellor of Students at the University of Seville between 1984 and 1986 and the Head of the Department of Civil Law, Private International Law and History of Institutions at the University of Huelva from September 1993 until March 1997. Valpuesta, who held the Chair of Civil Law at UPO, also held other positions outside the academic field. She was Vice-President of the Andalusian Advisory Council (1990-1955), a Counsellor of the Andalusian Advisory Council (1994-1997) and a member of the Andalusian Council for Minor Affairs (2002) and of the Autonomous Commission of Ethics and Research (2003). She was a member of different research groups, presented papers in national and international conferences and published in specialized journals, among which her collaboration in the collective work Enciclopedia Jur√≠dica B√°sica stands out. She was also a co-author in several books and published legal annotations on relevant court decisions. Valpuesta published works of reference such as ‚ÄúIguales y diferentes ante el derecho privado‚Äù, ‚ÄúEl levantamiento del Velo: Las Mujeres en el Derecho Privado‚Äù or her last work, ‚ÄúLa disciplina constitucional de la familia en la experiencia europea‚Äù, in the publishing house Tirant lo Blanch. = Immigrants‚Äô sit-in at UPO in 2002 = One of the incidents that she had to face during her term as a Vice-Chancellor was the sit-in of half a thousand illegal immigrants claiming their regularization in 2002. Finally, after several attempts to resolve the conflict, some altercations with workers and after they had threatened to occupy more buildings, she ordered the eviction of the immigrants from the University premises. Mariano Rajoy (who at the time was Spain's vice-president) linked the protest with the European Council meeting which was being held in Seville during those days, and with a call for a national strike. The People's Party (PP) asked the Andalusian Regional Government at the Regional Parliament to assume ‚Äúpolitical responsibilities‚Äù for ‚Äúencouraging and protecting‚Äù the sit- in of the illegal immigrants at the University premises.  Feminist activism  Rosario Valpuesta was an active participant in feminist movements and she repeatedly criticized women's double shift of work and domestic duties, the lower salaries they received for carrying out the same work as men, as well as the lower presence of women in top management positions. In this sense, she called for ‚Äúthe feminization of power‚Äù to facilitate women's access to those positions where decisions are made. She declared in a conference: ‚ÄúIn Spain, a politician‚Äôs day extends until ten at night, with 13 openings and 13 acts. This is incompatible with a personal life project, except in the case of women who assume the male values‚Äù. She also collaborated in different projects with many town halls in Andaluc√≠a in order to raise the awareness of rural women about their situation of subordination and work discrimination. She also worked in Latin America with women who fought for their rights in countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru or Bolivia and she participated in many programs to help them fight discrimination toward women. In recognition of her work on women's rights, she received several international awards throughout her career. She was named Honorary Professor of the National University of Saint Anthony the Abbot in Cuzco (Peru) in 1988 and of the University of Andina Sim√≥n Bol√≠var (Quito, Ecuador). In 2002, she received a Diploma of Honor from the Municipal Chamber of Curitiba (Brazil) and in June 2017 the National University of Catamarca in Argentina named her Doctor Honoris Causa. In Spain, the Civil Guard honored her with the ‚ÄúWhite Cross of Civil Merit‚Äù in October 2001. A year later, she entered the ‚ÄúReal Academia de las Ciencias, Bellas Artes y las Buenas Letras Luis V√©lez de Guevara‚Äù. In 2004, the University Pablo de Olavide awarded her with the medal of honor of the institution. In 2009, she received the Sociedad Award at the first edition of the Gabriela S√°nchez Aranda Awards, and in 2012 she was awarded the Meridiana Award, for her defense of equal rights between men and women. As a posthumous homage to Ms Valpuesta, the city of Seville awarded her with the Medal of the city in 2013, which was accepted by her son, Alberto Gir√°ldez Valpuesta.  Ms Valpuesta‚Äôs death  Aged 60, Rosario Valpuesta died of cancer, from which she had suffered for years, in her home city of Seville. A year before her death, the Regional Government of Andalusia, Jos√© Antonio Gri√±√°n being its President, awarded her with the Meridiana Award, coinciding with the International Women's Day. In 2009, President Rodr√≠guez Zapatero awarded her with the Plaza de Espa√±a Award for ‚Äúher defense of democratic values‚Äù; another award was presented to the journalist I√±aki Gabilondo. The Seville City Council (the Mayor being the socialist politician Alfredo S√°nchez Monteseir√≠n) named a street after her, for her activism in feminist and left-wing movements. This street, in the San Lorenzo neighborhood, in the city center, was renamed in accordance with the Spanish Historical Memory Law, which aims at renaming all streets in which any reference is made to Francoist Spain or to the Spanish Civil War. The University Pablo de Olavide paid homage to Rosario Valpuesta after her death.

The abandoned rail path continues in both directions; south of Manchester Street, the path is abandoned and walkable, although with no indication of it being a trail, while to the north, the trail continues as the Salem Rail Trail in Salem, New Hampshire. Along the trail, there are marshes, fences, houses, and a few businesses on the adjacent streets. Birds of various types, squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, turtles, beavers, and otters can be found on or next to the trail. The trail was gravel until early 2019. The portion of the trail in New Hampshire is still gravel; the state line can easily be seen by the change in material.  Route  From south to north, the trail officially starts at Manchester Street in Lawrence. The trail quickly enters Methuen. Near the city border, the trail connects to the Spicket River Greenway, a trail running from west to east through Lawrence. The Methuen Rail Trail parallels Railroad Street in Methuen, passing under Oakland Avenue and having an at-grade intersection with Union Street. Here there is a building that used to be a railroad station for the Manchester and Lawrence Railroad. The trail then reaches a parking area along Railroad Street. At about the halfway point, the trail passes under Osgood Street and Lowell Street (Route 113). The trail then crosses the Spicket River, a tributary of the Merrimack River vital to Methuen's development. Continuing north, the trail crosses under Route 213 and reaches a back entrance of the MSPCA.

He helped promote and develop early Canadian hip hop acts such as Maestro Fresh Wes, Michee Mee, Rumble & Strong and the Dream Warriors. Nelson was born in Pembroke Hall, Jamaica and emigrated to Canada in 1972. Known as the \\"godfather of Toronto hip hop\\", Nelson created Canada's first hip hop radio show, Fantastic Voyage, on CKLN-FM in 1983. The Saturday afternoon show, which ran until 1991, became popular among Toronto youth and was the first exposure many had to the genre and was one of the few broadcast outlets for hip hop in Canada during the 1980s. Nelson soon began organizing concerts, his first event being for the Kings of Rap. He went on to bring American hip hop artists to Canada for concerts and tours including, organizing in 1987, the first major rap concert in Canada when Run DMC, Public Enemy and EPMD performed at Varsity Arena. With the revenues from the concert, Nelson built one of the first hip hop recording studios in Canada, \\"Apache\\", in the basement of his Scarborough home. The studio, shared with Beat Factory was where Dream Warriors recorded their first album, And Now the Legacy Begins, on which Nelson is credited as a producer. Nelson was the best known hip hop concert promoter in Toronto in the 1980s and early 1990s, often staging his events at the Concert Hall at Toronto's Masonic Temple where he staged multi-artist concerts that featured acts such as Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions, Roxanne Shant√©, Salt-N-Pepa, Eric B. & Rakim, Ice Cube and Queen Latifah as well as giving exposure to local acts with \\"Monster Jams\\" and \\"rap battles\\" between Toronto and New York performers. As hip hop became more commercial, Nelson became disillusioned with the genre and ended Fantastic Voyage in 1991. He moved to dancehall and reggae, deejaying around the city and promoting shows before returning to CKLN in 1993 to launch what became ReggaeMania, a Friday night radio show that continued on CKLN until the radio station went off the air in 2011, and was then revived on CHIN-FM where it aired on Saturday nights from 2012 until 2014. Nelson owns and operates Reggaemania.com, an online hub which offers 24 hour internet radio station called ReggaeMania Radio, podcasts, downloads as well as news and concert listings as well as a ReggaeMania app. Nelson attended what is now Ryerson University from 1983 to 1985 earning a degree in Radio and Television Arts. He taught the course \\"Contemporary Black Urban Music\\" at York University from 2005 until 2017.

This joint stock company consisted of the union of the breweries of the Kosler brothers with the Reininghaus AG and Puntigam brewery in Graz. Between 1910 and 1926, Pivovarna Union acquired several small Slovenian brewery factories. In 1910 it acquired the Auer and Perless brewery in Ljubljana, in 1911 the \\"Perless\\" brewery in Koƒçevje, in 1912 the Smidt brewery in ≈†kofja Loka, in 1916 the Mayr brewery in Kranj and Zimmerman brewery in Lesce, in 1917 the brewery of Menge≈°, In 1918 the Fr√§hlich brewery in Vrhnika, in 1924 the Pivovarna La≈°ko and finally, in 1926, Thomas Gatz brewery in Maribor. All brewed mills stopped making beer independently, so the Pivovarna Union remained the only brewery in the Drava Banovina. Subsequently, some brands became independent on the market, such as Pivovarna La≈°ko. In 1925, the Pivovarna Union produced over 100,000 hectoliters of beer. Despite the difficulties caused by the outbreak of World War II, in 1945 the factory produced 45,000 hectoliters of beer. In 1946, when Slovenia was an integral part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the brewery was nationalized. In 1963, beer production rose to more than 220,000 hectoliters and today is around one million. In 2005 the La≈°ko Brewery acquired the majority of Union Brewery shares and subsequently became part of Heineken International in 2015 after Heineken acquired a majority stake of La≈°ko Brewery.

In about 1640 he probably designed a row of houses on the south side of Great Queen Street, London, decorated with Corinthian pilasters.

In 1653 he designed Thorpe Hall near Peterborough for Oliver St John, Oliver Cromwell's Lord Chief Justice. The final design involved the input of John Stone, a French-trained son of Nicholas Stone.

The problem with cross- border commuters (German, Grenzg√§nger) in the Berlin area was a result of the political separation of East- and West Berlin in the years of 1948 and 1949. It resulted from the affiliations of the municipalities to two different currencies; East Berlin districts would use the East German mark (Mark der DDR), and West Berlin districts would use the German mark (DM). Another cause was the difference is residential and industrial areas throughout Berlin, with the western districts being more prosperous. The Socialist Unity Party (SED), which governed East Berlin, used the matter of cross-border commuters in its propaganda, citing them as a problem, which helped them to justify the construction of the Berlin Wall, starting in August 1961.  Emergence  Following the introduction of the German Mark in the western sectors of Berlin, and the East German Mark in the Soviet Sector of Berlin, as well as the Soviet Occupation Zone (which completed the surrounding of West Berlin in areas which were not bordered by East Berlin), about 122,000 West Berliners were employed in East Berlin or the surrounding Berlin area, where they were paid in East German Marks (East cross-border commuters), while 76,000 East Berliners worked in the western Sectors of Berlin (West cross-border commuters), where initially, in the first months, they were paid in (West) German Marks, in accordance with a general payment ceiling. Because the exchange rate of 1:4 (1 German Mark to 4 East German Marks), meaning the German Mark had about four times the purchasing power of the East German Mark, the future existence of the wages of more than 120,000 West Berlin households was at risk.  Settlement through the Wage Compensation Fund  In order to be able to maintain a uniform Berlin employment market, on March 20, 1949, in addition the elimination of the payment ceiling, Western powers, together with the abolition of the capping limit, created a Wage Compensation Fund for employees of the industrial/business economy. This would mean that the East cross-border commuters could exchange 60% of their wages, which were paid in East German Marks, to (West) German Marks at the rate of 1:1 once back in West Berlin, while the West cross-border commuters were only paid 10% of their income in German Marks, and 90% of their income in East German Marks. The problem of East cross-border commuters, who were employed in positions of authority, or as police officers or teachers, was solved in 1948 and 49 during the political dividing of Berlin. They were only allowed to keep their jobs if they moved their residence to the Eastern sector of Berlin. They were not included in the Wage Compensation Fund in the Western sectors anyway. On the other hand, the SED failed to accomplish a corresponding reduction in the number of West cross-border commuters, . Apart from a brief slump around 1954, until the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, it was always around 40,000 to 60,000. Pressure on these cross-border commuters came by means of disadvantages in the allocation of housing, children's training opportunities and the issuance of travel permits. An arbitrary interpretation of the foreign exchange regulations by the SED, up to the imposition of imprisonment, did not lead to the abandonment of their jobs in West Berlin, but instead, in more than 50,000 cases, it led to these commuters fleeing to the west permanently. Nevertheless, the number of West cross-border commuters did not decrease significantly. Because of the reduction of the East cross-border commuters, the Wage Compensation Fund was able to continually increase the pay rate to the West cross-border commuters. By August 1961, it was up from 10% when first established to 40% in August 1961, with a maximum exchange limit of DM 275. The acceptance of a job in West Berlin was attractive because of access to the high-quality goods in contrast to what was available in East Berlin, and the favorable exchange rate from (West) German Marks to East German Marks, despite its legal uncertainty. In addition to the cross-border commuters that were legally registered in the East and West Berlin employment markets, West cross- border commuters who were worked in black market jobs existed, particularly in the cleaning, transportation, and catering industries. Their employment was illegal, irregular, paid hourly, and had a low economic significance with anywhere from 8,000 to 20,000 workers, who were often retirees.  The SED's solution of the problem  Poster addressing the problem of East Germans working in West Berlin. This poster was hung in shops the K√∂nigs Wusterhausen area (1961). In 1961, when fleeing the republic became more and more frequent, the SED passed legislation closing the West Berlin borders, and by unleashing a witch-hunt for West cross-border commuters for propagandist reasons, portraying them in public events and a press campaign as traitors, criminals and parasites. A series of new regulations, effective as of August 1, 1961, made the West cross-border commuters virtually impossible to continue their employment in West Berlin. However, before these provisions could fully take effect, the SED removed the problem of cross-border commuting in the Berlin area by building the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961. At this time, there were still 12,000 East cross-border commuters employed in East Berlin, including 6,000 at the Deutsche Reichsbahn (East German Railways). The rest were mostly active as artists (70% of the soloistic staff of the Deutsche Staatsoper on Unter den Linden were West Berliners), or as scientists, technicians or doctors. Because of the absence of payments made by East cross-border commuters, the Wage Compensation Fund had to adjust its payments to the East cross-border commuters; they were faced with the alternatives of giving up their jobs in the east, or migrating to the east. Only a few chose to resettle in the east. Because those with such skills were difficult for the GDR government to obtain, their workplaces went unfilled. The SED would accept this disadvantage in favor of the general closure of the GDR. The West cross- border commuters, by this time unemployed, were subject to long periods of discrimination in their everyday lives, employed in workplaces below their qualifications, and kept under police surveillance.

It presents an alphabetical list of cricketers who have debuted for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in first-class or List A matches from 1978. Players who debuted for MCC before 1978 can be found in List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946‚Äì1977). MCC have rarely taken part in List A matches (a total of fifteen between 1971 and 2008); and never (to 2017) in a top-class Twenty20 match. All the club's home matches have been played at its Lord's venue in London. The majority of MCC players in this period were contracted to county clubs and appeared for MCC by invitation. Some players were from other countries. The list includes players who took part in first- class matches for MCC on tour (e.g., to Bangladesh in 1999/2000). MCC teams have always operated at all levels of the sport and players who represented the club in minor cricket only are out of scope here. The details are the player's usual name followed by the span of years in which he was active as an MCC player in important matches (the span may include years in which he played only in minor matches for MCC and/or years in which he did not represent MCC in any matches) and then his name is given as it appears on match scorecards (e.g., surname preceded by all initials), followed by the club or team with which he was mostly associated (this may be MCC itself). Players who have taken part in Test cricket have their names highlighted in bold text and the names of players who represented MCC in a List A match are preceded by the symbol.

It was developed by Klei Entertainment. It is currently available in early access with a full release expected in Q4 2020. Gameplay Griftlands is a roguelike deck-building game with elements of role-playing and digital card games. The player starts a game by selecting one of the predefined characters, each a mercenary seeking fame and fortune in on a planetary world that is home to an antagonistic peacekeeper body, pirates, and dangerous creatures. While the layout of the world is the same each game, the events, missions, and other elements within it are procedurally generated on starting a new game. The game is broken up between moving about on an overworld map and engaging in conversation trees to gain quests or shop, and card-based encounters. At the start of the game, the player's character is given two pre-defined decks of cards, one representing those to be used in combat encounters, and another to be used in negotiations. As the player progresses in the game, they can gain new cards for either deck from quest rewards or through shops, upgrade existing cards to more potent versions, or have cards removed from either deck. Additionally, players can earn special implants for their character that have persistent effects throughout the rest of the game. Rook, an unlockable character, engages in conversation with Fssh, a Non-player character. If an encounter results in combat, then the player takes turn with the computer opponent. Each turn, the player is drawn a hand from their combat deck, and has a number of action points available to use to play cards, which have different action point costs. Combat cards represent a mix of offensive skills to attack the opponent, and defensive skills as to block attacks. The player is informed through the game's interface of what attacks their opponents will do, so they may prepare appropriately. Once the player has used their action points, they discard all remaining cards in their hand, and the opponent's turn is resolved. If the player's character health drops to zero, the game is over. Alternatively, the player can attack to kill their opponents in the same way, but may also try to simply overpower them, allowing the opponent to flee if they take enough damage. This choice may have future impacts on mission availability and rewards. Negotiations play out similarly to combat, though these are between the player character and a single foe. The goal in negotiations is to wear the opponent's resolve to zero before the player character's. Here, cards represent friendly negotiations which generally do not have ill effects, hostile commentary which may trigger certain actions, and defensive composure cards to prevent losing resolve. Like combat, the player is given information as to what moves the opponent will make. Additionally, special arguments may become active as a result of cards or other abilities. These arguments can damage the opponent's resolve or provide other boosts, among other effects, while they remain active. The player, instead of testing the resolve of the opponent, can try to take out the argument by attacking it directly. If the player's resolve drops to zero, this does not end the game, but changes what may follow: the attempt to swap an opponent may simply fail, or it may cause the player to engage in combat with the character. Should the player die, the game will restart, but give the player the option of carrying one positive result from the previous run into the new game, such as having made allies with a different character or having an implant available to the new character. Development Griftlands is being developed by Klei Entertainment. The game was announced at E3 2017, at that time being an open-world RPG with encounters being played out in turn-based combat similar to most Japanese RPGs. In the interim years, Klei mentioned little of Griftlands while producing Oxygen Not Included. In October 2018, Klei had posted to the game's product page that \\"we jumped the gun on announcing it because we thought we were further along than we were.\\" The game was re-shown at E3 2019, and while it retained the same setting and art style, the game had transitioned to card-based system, dropping the open world and more traditional role-playing games combat. Griftlands was released as an early access title in July 2019 for Epic Games Store for a year. The early access version was released on Steam on the 15th of June, 2020 alongside a free demo, and the full version of the game is expected in 6-12 months from the early access release date.

The comics deal primarily with God's daily struggles, as well as those of his creations, Adam, Eve, and their son Cain (depicted as a voice emanating from a small blue stroller). God is often frustrated by his creations, as they don't always turn out as planned. The comic's name comes from the Bible's account that God worked creating the world and its inhabitants for six days, and rested on Saturday, the seventh day/the Sabbath. Aside from the main characters, new characters and guests make their appearances as the series progresses, to include Freud, Nietzsche, Stephen Hawking, and other gods such as Zeus, Odin, and Ra.

Adam doesn't know how to deal with women; he hasn't had anyone to show him how, and consequently he is extremely sincere. If a woman asks ‚ÄúDo I look fat?‚Äù his answer will be ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. He feels wronged by God for being forced to live 900 years with the same woman, which only increases his asshole-ness. Naive, fun, womanizer, sexist. Adam is always good for a laugh despite the feminist outcry. Eve ‚Äì The Lisa Simpson of our blog, always having to put up with two childish guys, God and Adam, who have very archaic views on women. They always misunderstand her, despite her being an intelligent and proper lady. Cain ‚Äì The psychopathic baby, even from the cradle Cain already shows his killer instincts. He and God don't get along; God simply can't stand the idea of having a psycho grandson. Cain, never hesitant in his cruelty, insists that he ‚Äútakes after his grandfather.‚Äù Lou (Lucifer) ‚Äì Our charismatic little devil is not evil at all; in all actuality, it's humans who demonize him. Luci governs the infernal world, but that does not make him infernal. After all, someone would have to do the job anyway. He feels unjustly targeted as the excuse for all humankind's atrocities. He and God have had their disagreements, but now it's all in the past. All he wants is to live a peaceful life; that is of course, if humans let him.  Bar of the Gods  The Bar of the Gods is a bar where all the gods meet up to blow off steam, converse, and sometimes fight. The gods who frequent the bar are: Zeus ‚Äì God of ancient Greece, he lives to steal followers from God. Ra ‚Äì God of ancient Egypt, he has the head of a falcon and a human body. Odin ‚Äì Nordic god, he doesn't care about his public image and loves to drink and fight. He created humans out of wood, and is always arguing with God and the Mayan god about what material is best for creating humans. Mayan god ‚Äì he created humans out of corn, and just like Odin and God, he thinks his choice of material is better than all others. Ganesha ‚Äì Hindu god, with the head of an elephant and a human body. Obatala ‚Äì African god who loves the food offerings his followers give to him; originally appearing as a blackface character with red mouth, this god's appearance was redesigned in 2019 by Ruas to appear culturally accurate and respectful of the god's origins. Google ‚Äì New at the bar, this god of technology is making waves. Shiva ‚Äì The many-armed Hindu god, he's often depressed because he has lost so many followers. He works as a waiter at the bar.  Other characters  Carlos Ruas ‚Äì Appears in many of his own comic strips, usually chatting with God or playing pranks on him. Chico Xavier ‚Äì Appears Darwin ‚Äì He lives to debate his theory of evolution with God. Einstein ‚Äì A great fan of God's work Freud ‚Äì God's psychoanalyst Niemeyer ‚Äì Brazilian architect who is always trying to improve God's projects. Nietzsche ‚Äì God's rival, he and God are always trying to off each other. Nietzsche hates women, soccer, beer, communism, and especially capitalism. Platypus ‚Äì The butt of many jokes in the animal kingdom, and even among the gods, the platypus is frustrated by his name and appearance. Potatoists ‚Äì Aliens who spread the word of the Great Mother Potato. Raul Seixas ‚Äì Brazilian recording artist, singer, and songwriter; God's friend Socrates ‚Äì Ancient Greek philosopher Stephen Hawking ‚Äì World-renowned theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author; also an atheist Apostle Zacariah ‚Äì Hard-lining preacher/evangelist.

S.)‚Äì20 January 1944) was a noted Russian translator and literary figure from the Silver Age. Since the demise of the USSR, she has become noted for her memoirs and extensive letter correspondence, which provides a unique glimpse into the interwar years of Russia's past. Early life Eugenia Kazimirovna Gertsyk was born on 12 October 1878 in Alexandrov of the Moscow Governorate in the Russian Empire to Sofia Maximilianovna (n√©e Tidebel) () and Kasimir Antonovich Lubny-Gertsyk (). Her father was descended of an impoverished Polish- Lithuanian noble family and worked as an engineer for the railroad, heading the construction of the Moscow-Yaroslavl line. Her paternal uncle, Joseph Antonovich Lubny-Gertsyk, built the Baranov Manufacturing plant in the Alexandrovsky District town of Karabanovo. Her paternal aunt, Elena Antonovna Lubny-Gertsyk was married to the painter Lev Lagorio. Her mother, who died when Gertsyk and her sister, Adelaida, were young children was of German and Swiss heritage, though the family was entirely Russified, they were Lutheran. After their mother's death in 1880, Gertsyk's father remarried Eugenia Antonovna Vokach () and a half-brother Vladimir was born in 1885. Because of the nature of her father's work, Gertsyk grew up moving often, as her father constructed the rail line. After her birth in Alexandrov, they lived in Moscow then back to Alexandrov, and later Sevastopol and Yuriev-Polsky. All the children received a broad early education from tutors and governesses, which included the study of five languages encompassing English, French, German, Italian and Polish. They also traveled to Europe to experience diverse cultures during their childhood. Gertsyk went on to further her education studying history and philosophy entering the Bestuzhev Courses in 1901, from which she graduated with honors in 1905. Career Gertsyk began her career as a translator, working on translations of writers such as Edward Carpenter, Joris-Karl Huysmans, William James, and Friedrich Nietzsche, among others. She also wrote translations with her sister, of the works of Jean-Marie Guyau, Immanuel Kant, and Nietzsche. She published critical essays and articles, like –ë–µ—Å–æ–∏—Å–∫–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤ —Ç–∏—Ö–æ–º –æ–º—É—Ç–µ (Unclaimed in a Quiet Pool), published in 1906 in Golden Fleece magazine about Dmitri Merezhkovsky. In 1906 and again in 1913, she traveled to Rome, describing her impressions in the essay My Rome. The second trip was made after her conversion from Lutheranism to Russian Orthodoxy in 1911. She became a close friend of the poet, Vyacheslav Ivanov, defending his classicist style against more modern trends in Russian literature and wrote an article –†–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏—è —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∞—é—â–µ–≥–æ –ë–æ–≥–∞ (The Religion of the Suffering God) about him. Between 1915 and 1917, she lived with her sister Adelaida at her home in Moscow. During the Russian Revolution the entire family, including her brother, Vladimir and his family, lived in Sudak. The intellectual community living in the Crimea included such people as the actress Lyudmila Erarskaya, poet Sophia Parnok, composer and musician Alexander Spendiarov, the poet Maximilian Voloshin, and the threesome, Polyxena Solovyova, her partner, Natalia Manaseina, and Manaseina's husband Mikhail. As a group, the intellectual community worked on productions for their own entertainment. Parnok and both Gertsyk sisters wrote verse, Spendiarov wrote songs, and Erarskaya staged plays, Parnok viewed Gertsyk as a spiritual mother, someone who was helping her mature in her devotion. Letters exchanged with other intellectuals like Nikolai Berdyaev, who called her the \\"most remarkable woman of the twentieth century\\", and Lydia Berdyaev reflect her philosophical nature and quest to understand man's place in the universe. The family home in Moscow was nationalized during the war, forcing the Gertsyk clan to remain in Crimea, despite the desperate conditions and famines. Her sister died in Sudak in 1925 and the following year, Adelaide's husband Dmitry Evgenievich Zhukovsky was banished to the Vologda Oblast. In 1927, Gertsyk, along with Vladimir, his invalid wife Lyubov Aleksandrovna, and their daughter Veronika moved to the Caucasus. Gertsyk provided the constant care and nursing needed by Lyubov Aleksandrovna, who had polyarthritis, and helped with raising her niece. They lived in various places, such as Kislovodsk, where they remained for eleven years. Then they briefly lived in Zelenchuk and Batalpashinsk, before moving to the Central Chernozem Reserve. Around this same time, Gertsyk began to write her memoirs in 1936 and continued her wide correspondence with many Russian √©migr√©s. In 1941, the reserve was evacuated and the family moved to the small village of Zelenaya Steppe. During the Nazi Occupation, which lasted from 1941 to 1943 her sister-in-law died and Gertsyk finished her memoirs. Death and legacy Gertsyk died on 20 January 1944 at a farm in the village of Zelenaya Steppe in the Kursk Oblast. During her lifetime, Gertsyk was known for her translations and intellectual salons. She is most known today for her various memoirs and letter collections which have been published and give a unique perspective on life in the interwar period. A part of her letter exchange with Vera Grinevich is housed in Alexander Solzhenitsyn's House of Russians Abroad.

Given its short runway, the airport serves only small aircraft, up to .Slovenia Gliding Team site It is maintained by ≈†ale≈°ki Aeroklub.≈†ale≈°ki Aeroklub site History Interest in aviation in the ≈†alek Valley was catalyzed by the first flight into the valley, the landing of an Italian aircraft in 1927. Through the 1930s, aviation enthusiasts Maks Medved and Valter Muhovec attempted to circumvent the lack of tools and equipment and assembled a home-built glider; however, the aircraft was completely destroyed during a test run in 1937. The pair then enlisted the expertise of the flying club in Maribor, and created their own flying club. The aspirations of these early aviators were cut short by the outbreak of World War II. Following the war, a flying club was officially established on 24 November 1971. The airport's runway was constructed between 1972 and 1973, and the first operation was carried out by Jo≈æe Ocepek on 24 March 1974. The flying club took possession of the hangar on 14 December 1974, and of the runway in October 1980. Today, the ≈†alek flying club is the sole owner and operator of the airport. Facilities The airport has one asphalt runway with dimensions . It lies on a northeast-southwest axis with true heading 149.19¬∞ (329.19¬∞). Significantly, surrounding terrain and wind patterns mean that the runway is usable only in one direction: runway 15 is for takeoffs only, while runway 33 may only be used for landings. An area of hardened grass stretches approximately beyond the threshold of runway 33, and may be used for aircraft maneuvering in appropriate weather. The runway is connected to small ramp and hangar by a single paved taxiway designated Y, necessitating either a backtrack along the runway or taxiing on the grass following landing and preceding takeoff. Several areas of grass between the runway and hangar are also sufficiently hardened to be used by light aircraft during appropriate weather. The airport is also equipped with a fuel pump, light maintenance equipment, and a guest house. The airport has no control tower, and is open to VFR flights only; pilots communicate with each other on the frequency 128.30 MHz.

In appearance it resembles a woman (German: Frau) on a horse, hence the name. According to legend the peak is a petrified giant queen, called Frau Hitt, who was known for her avarice and self-infatuation. The legend has various versions. One widespread story is that Frau Hitt only offered a beggar woman a stone to eat. The beggar woman was so incensed by this mockery that she cursed the giantess and her horse, which were then turned into stone as an eternal punishment.

Summary The main competition was held over all six days, with 16 pairs of men competing to cover the largest number of laps in a series of madison events. Points were also awarded in a number of other shorter events, such as derny and elimination races, with each 100 points awarding an extra lap. Alongside this, six sprinters raced every night in match sprint and keirin races. There was also a women's omnium event which took place over the final three days. British cycling legends Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish attended the event for the first time, competing as a pair, but were defeated by reigning champions Kenny De Ketele and Moreno De Pauw and took second place instead. Both teams also competed at the Six Days of Ghent later that year, where the order was reversed, with Wiggins declaring that to be his final competitive race.

He was also inspired by the personality cult of Kim Il-sung. According to the British journalist Edward Behr, Ceau»ôescu admired Kim as a leader because he dominated his nation and broke free from Soviet control, combining totalitarian methods with ultra-nationalist and communist ideologies.Behr, Edward Kiss the Hand You Cannot Bite, New York: Villard Books, 1991 page 195. Behr wrote that the possibility for \\"vast Potemkin villages for the hoodwinking of gullible foreign guests\\" that Ceau»ôescu had seen in North Korea was something that never seemed to have crossed his mind before. Upon his return to Romania, Ceau»ôescu began to emulate North Korea's system, influenced by Kim's Juche philosophy. He issued the July Theses, a set of proposals that tightened government control over Romanian media, promoted nationalism, and intensified his personality cult. North Korean books on Juche were translated into Romanian and widely distributed inside the country. The militaries of both countries began to co-operate on sensitive issues. At the same time, Romania had a rapprochement with the United States. In 1973, North Korea tried to use Romania as an intermediary with the US, but the Romanian diplomats didn't want to harm their developing relationship with the US. Post-Communist Romania Embassy of Romania in Pyongyang Relations between North Korea and Romania became strained after Romania's Communist government fell. Ceausescu's execution during the 1989 Romanian Revolution and the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union resulted in Romania rejecting the totalitarian ideology that the North Korean government still promotes. Romania allied itself with nations hostile to the DPRK: it established relations with North Korea's rival the Republic of Korea (South Korea) on March 30, 1990, entered NATO in 2004, and joined the European Union in 2007.https://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-07/news/mn-174_1_north-korea However, it continues to maintain ties in the educational field.

One of the most common types consists of a government setting one exchange rate for specific transactions involving foreign exchange and another exchange rate governing other transactions. A dual exchange rate policy can arise for a variety of reasons. In the past European and Latin American countries have used dual exchange rates to ease the transition from a fixed rate to a floating rate. Dual exchange rates are similar to multiple exchange rates in that they can appear when there is simultaneously both an official and black market rate. History In the gold standard and the Bretton Woods system, the major developed countries mainly implemented fixed exchange rate systems. Due to the devaluation of the pound around the 1970s and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, many developed countries switched to floating exchange rates. In 1971, France started to adopt the dual exchange rate system. After that, in 1973, Italy also adopted this system. Both countries maintained these dual exchange rate systems through the early 1970s. The Belgium‚ÄìLuxembourg Economic Union has been using this system since 1957.M.A.G. van Meerhaeghe, The Belgium-Luxemburg Economic Union, Tilburg, SUERF Series 54 A, 1987, p. 10. Around the same time (i.e. the 1970s), many Latin American countries also shifted from a single exchange rate system to a dual exchange rate system or a multiple exchange rate system. With the structural adjustment to international trade that has occurred since the mid-1980s, especially the deepening of trade reform, Latin American countries have begun gradually abandoning multiple exchange rate systems, favoring instead the implementation of single exchange rate systems. From 1981 to 1985, during a period of Chinese economic reform, China formally implemented a dual exchange rate system. After 1985, China appeared in the foreign exchange market and the official exchange rate coexisted with a market-determined exchange rate. This system, though, didn't last long and was abandoned in 1994. From 1985 to 1995, South Africa also implemented a dual exchange rate system, and achieved remarkable results. Advantages The advantages of dual exchange systems are tied primarily to their ability to prevent capital movements from affecting the current account and the exchange rate for current transactions by separating the exchange market for capital transactions and the exchange market for current transactions. Dual exchange systems are oftentimes used as a short-term alternative to placing quantitative controls on capital movements, especially in cases where a country may be transitioning between exchange rate types.. =Inflation= Dual exchange rates are oftentimes used to stabilize currency values when countries face financial crises. Because most modern financial crises are preceded by substantial inflows and outflows of short to medium- term loans (which create financial instability), countries may implement dual exchange markets in order to discourage undesirable capital imports. Dual exchange rates are able to discourage these undesirable imports while maintaining desirable capital imports and allowing the exchange rate of the current account market to remain independent of the exchange rate of the capital account market, thereby preventing substantial negative effects on the current account. This separation will prevent the current account exchange rate from devaluing or overvaluing a country‚Äôs exports and may prevent inflation that would otherwise take place due to the inflows of undesirable capital imports. =Government Revenue= Countries implementing dual exchange systems may merely separate the exchange rates for the current and capital account markets, or they may set controls on one or the other; the latter option being intended to raise revenue for the government. Countries implementing such systems typically put any exchange controls on the market for financing current transactions. However, economists such as Raymond Mikesell have argued against use of exchange controls in dual exchange systems except those necessary to maintain the separation of the markets. Disadvantages In times of economic collapse, countries may choose to implement a dual exchange rate. This policy change can be seen as an efficient way to alleviate short-run economic hardship. However, dual exchange rate policies have several long-run economic problems. The primary issue that may arise within an economy operating under a dual exchange rate is misallocation of resources because dual exchange rate will reduce some industry‚Äôs favorable exchange rate and those industry will not necessarily reflect its actual need because its performance have been unnaturally inflated. Continual misallocation of resources will eventually cause economic distortion. A dual exchange rate economy suffering from distortion will incur disparity between the financial exchange rate and the commercial exchange rate. Such an event can lead to the emergence of black markets and arbitrage from individuals seeking to make capital gains. Usage of a dual-exchange system in the long-run will cause inflation. The different exchange rates make it possible for a government to incur a loss in foreign currency transactions, resulting in the central bank printing more money to fix the loss. Over the long-run, this will result in significant inflation. If there is no government intervention these issues will persist and create serious economic distortion behavior.

Definition In a standard Tobit model, represented as y=(x\\\\beta+u) 1[x\\\\beta+u>0], where ux\\\\sim N(0,\\\\sigma^2)This model construction implicitly imposes two first order assumptions:Wooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass, pp 690. (1) Since: \\\\partial P[y>0]/\\\\partial x_j=\\\\varphi (x\\\\beta/\\\\sigma) \\\\beta_j/\\\\sigma and \\\\partial \\\\operatorname E[y\\\\mid x,y >0]/\\\\partial x_j=\\\\beta_j\\\\\\\\{1-\\\\theta(x\\\\beta/\\\\sigma\\\\\\\\}, the partial effect of x_j on the probability P[y>0] and the conditional expectation: \\\\operatorname E [y\\\\mid x,y >0] has the same sign:Here, the notation follows Wooldrige (2002). Function \\\\theta (x)=\\\\lambda' where \\\\lambda (x) = \\\\varphi (\\\\chi)/\\\\Phi (\\\\chi), can be proved to be between 0 and 1. (2) The relative effects of x_h and x_j on P[y>0] and \\\\operatorname E [y\\\\mid x,y>0] are identical, i.e.: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial P[y>0]/\\\\partial x_h}{\\\\partial P[y>0]/ \\\\partial x_j}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\operatorname E[y\\\\mid x,y>0]/ \\\\partial x_h}{ \\\\partial \\\\operatorname E[y\\\\mid x,y>0]/ \\\\partial x_j} = \\\\frac{\\\\beta_h}{\\\\beta_j} However, these two implicit assumptions are too strong and inconsistent with many contexts in economics. For instance, when we need to decide whether to invest and build a factory, the construction cost might be more influential than the product price; but once we have already built the factory, the product price is definitely more influential to the revenue. Hence, the implicit assumption (2) doesn't match this context.For more application example of corner solution model, refer to: Daniel J. Phaneuf, (1999): ‚ÄúA Dual Approach to Modeling Corner Solutions in Recreation Demand‚Äù,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, Volume 37, Issue 1, Pages 85-105, ISSN 0095-0696. The essence of this issue is that the standard Tobit implicitly models a very strong link between the participation decision ( y=0 or y>0) and the amount decision (the magnitude of y when y>0). If a corner solution model is represented in a general form: y=s \\\\centerdot w, , where s is the participate decision and w is the amount decision, standard Tobit model assumes: : s=1[x\\\\beta +u>0]; : w=x\\\\beta+u. To make the model compatible with more contexts, a natural improvement is to assume: : s=1[x \\\\gamma +u>0], \\\\text{ where } u \\\\sim N (0,1); w=x\\\\beta + e, where the error term (e) is distributed as a truncated normal distribution with a density as \\\\varphi (\\\\cdot) / \\\\Phi \\\\left(\\\\frac{x\\\\beta}\\\\sigma \\\\right)/\\\\sigma; s and w are independent conditional on x. This is called Truncated Normal Hurdle Model, which is proposed in Cragg (1971). By adding one more parameter and detach the amount decision with the participation decision, the model can fit more contexts. Under this model setup, the density of the y given x can be written as: : f (y\\\\mid x)= [1-\\\\Phi (\\\\chi\\\\gamma)]^1[_{y-0}] \\\\cdot \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\Phi\\\\ (\\\\chi\\\\gamma)}{\\\\Phi ( \\\\chi\\\\beta/\\\\sigma)} \\\\left. \\\\varphi \\\\left(\\\\frac{y-\\\\chi\\\\beta}{\\\\sigma}\\\\right) \\\\right/ \\\\sigma\\\\right] ^1[_{^y>0}] From this density representation, it is obvious that it will degenerate to the standard Tobit model when \\\\gamma= \\\\beta/\\\\sigma. This also shows that Truncated Normal Hurdle Model is more general than the standard Tobit model. The Truncated Normal Hurdle Model is usually estimated through MLE. The log-likelihood function can be written as: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\ell(\\\\beta,\\\\gamma,\\\\sigma) = {} & \\\\sum_{i=1}^N 1[y_i = 0] \\\\log [1-\\\\Phi (x_i \\\\gamma) ] +1 [y_i>0] \\\\log [\\\\Phi (x_i \\\\gamma)] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & {} + 1[y_i>0] \\\\left[ -\\\\log \\\\left[\\\\Phi \\\\left( \\\\frac{x_i\\\\beta} \\\\sigma \\\\right)\\\\right] + \\\\log \\\\left(\\\\varphi \\\\left(\\\\frac{y_i-x_i\\\\beta} \\\\sigma \\\\right) \\\\right) -\\\\log (\\\\sigma) \\\\right] \\\\end{align} From the log-likelihood function, \\\\gamma can be estimated by a probit model and (\\\\beta,\\\\sigma) can be estimated by a truncated normal regression model.Wooldridge, J.

Trump is a lawsuit filed on June 12, 2017, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs, the U.S. state of Maryland and the District of Columbia, allege that the defendant, President Donald Trump, has violated the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution by accepting gifts from foreign governments. The lawsuit was filed by D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh. The suit alleges that Trump has committed \\"unprecedented constitutional violations\\" by not disentangling his business interests from his presidential responsibilities. The attorneys general cited the Trump International Hotel's effect on business in the Washington D.C. area as one reason for filing the lawsuit. The suit seeks an injunction to stop Trump from violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution. The attorneys general stated they will seek Trump's tax returns as part of their case. A three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case in July 2019, ruling that the attorneys general lacked legal standing to sue. All three of the judges were appointed by Republican presidents. New arguments in an en banc rehearing of the appeal were heard on December 12, 2019. On May 14, 2020, the full Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the defense's attempt to have the case dismissed on the grounds of presidential immunity by a 9-to-6 majority, reviving the lawsuit. Context The Maryland filing follows a lawsuit filed in January 2017 by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, CREW v. Trump, which also alleged that Trump has violated the emoluments clause. The D.C. and Maryland lawsuit is the first time a government entity has sued a president for violating the clause. In response to the lawsuit on the day of the filing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated that the president was not in violation of the emoluments cause, and would \\"move to dismiss this case\\", which Spicer characterized as \\"partisan politics\\". Spicer noted that both attorneys general filing the suit are Democrats. Republican National Committee spokesperson Lindsay Jancek also stated that President Trump was in compliance with the law, and called the lawsuit \\"absurd\\". Although the complaint was served to President Trump on June 27, 2017, the parties agreed on an extension to accommodate the work load and a vacation for a DOJ lawyer, so the first formal response was not required prior to . On November 28, 2017, the plaintiffs won the right to subpoena documents from the Trump Organization, forcing it to retain any documents relevant to the suit. On July 25, 2018, Federal District Judge Peter Messitte allowed the case to proceed; denying the Justice Department's attempt to have the case dismissed. The Justice Department had argued that the clause is not relevant to Trump's businesses. On November 2, Judge Messitte ordered discovery to begin. On December 3, Maryland and the District of Columbia issued subpoenas for Trump's financial records related to his D.C. hotel. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay days later at the behest of the Justice Department, pending hearings in March 2019. This prevented the subpoena of documents until the Court of Appeals rules if the case can go forward. In December 2018, Maryland prosecutors subpoenaed financial documents of Trump Organization‚Äôs golf resorts in Scotland. At a hearing on March 18, 2019, a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals was sharply skeptical of the legal basis of the suit, and dismissed the case on July 10, 2019. Arguments to reinstate the case were held before an en banc panel on December 12, 2019. The parallel CREW v. Trump case, in a different judicial circuit, was reinstated in September 2019 with the New York appellate panel rejecting the reasoning of the July opinion in this case. See also * CREW v.

Biography  national museum. He was born in Marienburg, now Al≈´ksne in Latvia. His father, Johann Ernst Gl√ºck (1652‚Äî1705), was a German Lutheran theologian, pastor, teacher and also known for translating the Bible into the Latvian and Russian languages; his mother, Christian Emerentia von Reutern (?‚Äî1740), belonged to the Livonian nobility. As a child, he received his education at home. From 1716, he lived in Prussia and studied law at the University of K√∂nigsberg. In 1725 by the order of Empress Catherine I he was employed as an assessor in the Justice Collegium of the Livonian and Estonian Affairs (it was renamed several times during his work): from 23 November 1739 ‚Äî The Livonian and Estonian Affairs Collegium; from 8 February 1742 ‚Äî The Justice Collegium of the Livonian and Estonian Affairs; from 15 December 1763 ‚Äî The Justice Collegium of the Livonian, Estonian and Finnish Affairs. The Justice Collegium of the Livonian and Estonian Affairs was in charge of all judicial institutions of the provinces attached in The Great Northern War of 1700‚Äî1721 but the highest court of appeal was the Senate (since 1762 the institutions of Vyborgskaya province belonged to the Justice Collegium of the Livonian and Estonian Affairs). The Collegium of the Livonian and Estonian Affairs did not have a founding document that is why its range of duties was not exactly defined. The Justice Collegium of the Livonian and Estonian Affairs was in charge of administrative affairs (the appointment of officials, the correspondence with imperial institutions): the court (processing of complaints on the wrong actions of the local administration and appeals against class courts\` decisions and sentences); taxes (in 1739‚Äî1742); church problems of the Baltic population and Vyborgskaya province population, the Protestant Church in the Russian Empire (marriage, divorce, pastors\` appointment and dismissal, disputes between the parishioners and the clergy, the maintenance of church service, establishing holidays). The peculiarity of the Collegium of the Livonian and Estonian Affairs was its activity guided by the local (mostly Swedish) legislation of the 15th ‚Äî the beginning of 18th centuries and the church (canon) law but not the Russian (Imperial) legal system. The official language of the Collegium of the Livonian and Estonian Affairs was German. Ernst Gottlieb Gl√ºck as many officials of this Collegium, belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran Church. In 1740, Ernst Gottlieb Gl√ºck was appointed the first councillor to the Justice Collegium of the Livonian and Estonian Affairs. In September 1741 he submitted an application to grant him and his descendants a diploma to the nobility and a coat of arms. He was given the coat of arms: ‚ÄúA gold winged ball; there was the Happiness or the Fortune on it‚Äù. The coat of arms and the diploma to the nobility had not been approved by Empress Elizabeth for the unknown reason that time. Since 1754 some Russian researchers have called Ernst Gottlieb Gl√ºck the Vice-president of the Justice Collegium of the Livonian and Estonian Affairs. Baltisches Biographisches Lexikon doubts this fact. D. Raskin also called Emme F. the Vice-president of the Justice Collegium of the Livonian and Estonian Affairs in 1741‚Äî1764 and Klingstedt T. in 1764‚Äî1771 but did not mention Ernst Gottlieb Gl√ºck. At first the authoritative genealogical reference by Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky \\"The Russian genealogy book\\" called him the Vice-president of the Justice Collegium in its text, but it was another collegial authority, then the Vice-president of the Livonian and Estonian Affairs Justice Collegium and the actual state councilor in the changes and additions to the Volume 1. In 1781, the Senate passed a resolution about Ernst Gottlieb Gl√ºck\`s diploma to the nobility and his coat of arms: \\"15 March 1745 it is ordered to offer a diploma made by Gl√ºck for the signing of Her Majesty, when she will be in the Senate. And as the diploma is not used at present time, give it to the Archive‚Äù. By that time, Gl√ºck had been already dead for fourteen years.  Private life  Ernst Gottlieb Gl√ºck was married twice.

Life Edmunds was the son of Edward Reynolds, a solicitor, and his wife, Edna (n√©e Jones). He was educated at St Paul's School, London, then qualified at St Thomas' Hospital in 1958, interrupting his course to study science with Henry Barcroft and Maureen Young. Reynolds was a world championship fencer, winning a bronze in the team event in the 1955 World Fencing Championships. Career In 1962, Reynolds travelled to the United States as a research fellow with Dav Cook visiting both the Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. While there, they researched hyaline membrane disease. After a quick visit to Yale School of Medicine, Reynolds returned to the UK in 1964, taking an appointment at the Department of Paediatrics at University College Hospital in London, working under Professor Leonard B. Strang and to help him establish a unit to study the fetal and neonatal lung. This collaboration led to team which produced a series of remarkable reports on pathophysiology. Starting in 1976, Reynolds was appointed to the Chair in Neonatal Paediatrics at the University of London, becoming Emeritus in 1996. He was also Head of the Department of Paediatrics at University College London and the Middlesex School of Medicine from 1987 to 1992. He also served as President of the Neonatal Society. Contribututions Reynolds was one of the first pioneers in imagining to appraise brain injury in children suffering from Hypoxia. He researched the condition in both piglets and lambs, and this research led to formation of a team, that was able to build a device that captured the first human phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This led to Reynolds most important discovery, that brain cells didn't die after injury, but instead there was a period where the physician could intervene to repair the injury.

Biography The coat of arms of the Gossler family; the version adopted by her father in 1773 to the left; the version used from the early 19th century to the right Anna Henriette Gossler, who went by the name of Henriette, was a member of the Hanseatic Berenberg/Gossler banking family, arguably the most prominent family of the then independent city-state of Hamburg alongside the related Amsinck family. She was the oldest daughter of the bankers Johann Hinrich Gossler and Elisabeth Berenberg, owners of Berenberg Bank, which had been founded by her family in 1590. On 20 May 1788, she married her father's employee Ludwig Erdwin Seyler, who immediately was made a partner in the bank and remained so until his death nearly half a century later. After the death of her father in 1790 her husband became head of the company. Particularly in the years around the Napoleonic Wars she and her husband played prominent roles in Hamburg high society and politics, and Berenberg Bank was headquartered in their private home.Obituary, Hamburger Nachrichten, 12 August 1836, p. 5Percy Ernst Schramm (1963), Neun Generationen: Dreihundert Jahre deutscher Kulturgeschichte im Lichte der Schicksale einer Hamburger B√ºrgerfamilie (1648‚Äì1948).

Its larvae tunnel under the bark of pine trees, weakening and sometimes killing the trees. Description This is the largest bark beetle in the southeastern United States, with an adult length of . It is cylindrical, dark reddish-brown or black. The prothorax is narrower at the front than at the back and does not completely cover the head. The antennae are club-shaped, the front of the head is convex, and the tip of the abdomen is rounded. The larvae are creamy-white with orange-brown heads, and have no legs. When fully developed they are about in length. Distribution D. terebrans is native to eastern United States where it attacks both native pines and exotic pine species. Its range extends from New Hampshire southwards through the coastal plain to Florida and westward to Texas and Missouri. The red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens) has a much wider distribution in the eastern United States, and the ranges of the two species overlap very little. Life cycle This beetle is strongly attracted to volatile chemicals produced by freshly cut pine stumps, and it will infest these as well as intact trees, in particular selecting trees that are stressed. The trees are often simultaneously attacked by certain species of engraver beetles (Ips spp.) and the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis). D. terebrans attacks pine trees near the base. A female beetle tunnels into the bark and has to overcome the resin exuded by the tree as a defence. This oozing resin mixes with the wood dust and forms a pinkish \\"pitch tube\\" on the bark at the site of entry. If she successfully gains entry into the sapwood, the female spends about a fortnight excavating a gallery which typically is at first horizontal and then goes vertically downwards, often to below ground level. Here she is joined by a male and lays about a hundred eggs at one side of the gallery. The eggs hatch after ten to fourteen days and the larvae fan out, chewing their way side by side through the surface layers of the sapwood, creating a gallery packed full with the frass they produce. This gallery resembles that formed by the red turpentine beetle and the Mexican bark beetle (Dendroctonus rhizophagus), which both feed on pine, and the great spruce bark beetle (Dendroctonus micans), which feeds on spruce. When they have completed their development, the larvae tunnel away from each other individually and create pupation chambers in which they pupate. When the adult insects emerge, they drill their way to the surface and disperse. In Florida, breeding takes place at any time of year, and there may be three overlapping generations. The beetle can act as a vector for the blue stain fungus, carrying it from one tree to another. A European predatory beetle, Rhizophagus grandis, that normally preys on the related great spruce bark beetle, has been found experimentally to be attracted to the frass produced by the black turpentine beetle larvae. Biological control using this predator is being investigated, with a batch of beetles imported from Belgium being released in Louisiana in 1988.

As part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, the game serves as a sequel to 2015's Sonic Runners. The game was first released in select regions on June 10, 2017, and was released to the rest of the world on August 9, 2017. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its presentation, gameplay and level design, although its amount of ads and technical problems were criticized. It was also a commercial success, in contrast to its predecessor. Gameplay Similar to its predecessor Sonic Runners, Sonic Runners Adventure is a platform game with endless runner elements. Players choose between several different characters, each with unique abilities. Players must guide their chosen character through a series of levels based on locations in Sonic Generations and Sonic Lost World. Characters automatically move forward, so players must tap their screen to avoid obstacles and enemies. Scattered around levels are golden rings, which serve as a form of health: rings protect the player from enemies or obstacles, though they scatter when the player is hit and blink before disappearing. Several changes from the original game have been made as well; the game can be played offline, and there are three types of levels in the game: \\"Finite\\", \\"Looped\\", and \\"Infinite\\". Development In April 2017, Gameloft accidentally released a FAQ webpage for a purported sequel to Sonic Team's 2015 endless running game Sonic Runners, titled Sonic Runners Adventure. The page was quickly taken down, though it was later restored when the game was launched in PAL regions on June 10, 2017. When the game was initially released back in August, the game was only made exclusive to Gameloft's store in which you had to pay money to download the app. However, on December 1, 2017, it was officially announced by Gameloft on social media and their website that the game will officially release on the App Store and Google Play sometime soon. Reception Carter Dotson of TouchArcade expressed hope that an iOS version of the game would be released, and praised the fact that it was a game with a fixed price, rather than the original Runner freemium approach. The game received generally positive reviews from critics. It currently holds a Metacritic score of 78 out 100, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\", with the gameplay, level design and presentation receiving praise, although its amount of ads and technical were criticized.

The most important of these is the vara, which, while ambiguous in the past, was legally established to be exactly 33 and 1/3 inches long in June of 1919. The subdivision levels in Texas are as follows:  General Subdivisions  # State boundary # Railroad district (12 total, county boundaries) # County In Texas, the highest level of land subdivision is the boundary of the state itself. Below this are the Texas railroad districts, of which there are 12. These are Spanish grants, surveyed on the \\"metes and bounds\\" system of measurement, and are of irregular shape and size. Counties are contained within railroad districts, but township/section, block, and league/labor measurements are not required to follow county boundaries. This is because original measurement lines were drawn before county lines.  Townships and Sections (South Texas)  # Township # Section Townships and sections, only found in southern Texas, follow the same style as the Public Land Survey System but do not include ranges. Sections are numbered between 1 and 9,999, but can include fractions (as in 65.5)  Blocks (West Texas)  # Block # Tract Blocks (groups of joined or non-joined subdivided surveyed land) are not restricted to rectangles or squares but based on survey layouts and individual property bounds. Original block lines were drawn before any official boundaries were created. Tracts, found within blocks, are special categories. Neither blocks nor tracts obey county lines.  Leagues and Labors (North and East Texas)  # League (4,428 acres) # Labor (177 acres) When a league is subdivided, it is subdivided into 25 labors. Leagues can be divided or undivided (some leagues exist without labors). Labors cannot exist without leagues. A labor is one million square varas. Therefore, a league is 25 million. \\"A league and a labor\\" was a common first land grant and consisted of a league of land away from the river plus one extra labor of good riparian (river-situated) land. A headright of this much land was granted to \\"all persons [heads of families] except Africans and their descendants and Indians living in Texas on the day of the declaration of independence.\\" To any single man, 17 years or older, one-third league was granted (1476 acres).

Considered one of Colorado's greatest all-around athletes, she earned multiple titles in women's amateur tennis and golf championships at the city and state level. Following her retirement from competition, she served on numerous sports boards and became involved in sports education for disabled youth. She was inducted into the Colorado Golf Hall of Fame in 1977, the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 1981, and the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1996. Early life and education Joan Packard was born in Denver, Colorado, on November 17, 1928, to Dr. George Packard, a surgeon. She was the second of three girls. She gained her early athletic practice playing baseball, football, basketball and tennis with other children in nearby City Park, but due to the absence of organized sports for high school girls, she did not compete formally until university. She graduated from East High School in 1946 and went on to Colorado University, where she met her husband, Ormand Birkland. They married in 1948. In university she played for an Amateur Athletic Union basketball team called the Denver Viners. After meeting her husband, who enjoyed golf, she took up that sport as well. Career Birkland began competing in tennis championships at the city and state level in the 1960s. She won the Denver amateur singles title in 1960, 1961, and 1965, and the Colorado state tennis title in 1960, 1962, and 1966. She won a total of six singles and 15 doubles titles in Colorado and Intermountain tennis tournaments. In 1962 she accepted her friends' challenge to compete in both the state tennis and state golf championships in the same summer, and won both titles. She repeated this feat in 1966. Between 1960 and 1966 she won seven state golf championships. She also participated in the skiing and bowling teams at the Denver Country Club. In recognition of her golfing ability, the Denver Country Club hosted a \\"Beat Joanie Day\\" at the end of each season for a six-year period. The challenge was open to any other member, but Birkland always won the match. She finished first in the club's golf tournaments for 30 consecutive years. After retiring from competition, Birkland became a women's sports advocate and instructor for disabled youth. In the 1990s she and Dorothy Mauk resuscitated the Sportswomen of Colorado awards program, for which she serves as executive director. She was a golf instructor in the amputee program at Children's Hospital, a basketball teacher for children with asthma, and a bowling instructor for children with cerebral palsy. Affiliations and memberships Birkland served two terms as chairman of the USGA Women's Committee, which oversees seven annual women's USGA tournaments. She was president of the Denver Tennis Club from 1991 to 1992. She has served on many sports boards of directors, including Pioneer Sportswomen at the University of Denver, Boys and Girls Clubs of Metro Denver, Hospice of Metro Denver, Institute of Health Education, Colorado Xplosion women's basketball team, and Girls in Golf. She also served on the board of directors of the Colorado Golf Hall of Fame and Colorado Sports Hall of Fame. Awards and honors In 1962, after winning both the state tennis and state golf championships in the same summer, Birkland received the Robert Russell award as Colorado amateur athlete of the year. She was inducted into the Colorado Golf Hall of Fame in 1977, the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 1981, and the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1996. She is considered one of the greatest all-around athletes in Colorado's history because of her awards in basketball, tennis, and golf. The Joan Birkland Pavilion at the Gates Tennis Center in Denver, headquarters of USTA Colorado, was named in her honor.

It was Justice Neil Gorsuch's first written opinion since joining the Court in April 2017.SCOTUSblog: Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc. Background CitiFinancial loaned money to several individuals seeking to purchase automobiles. When the loans went unpaid, CitiFinancial repossessed and sold them to Santander Consumer USA, and told the individuals they owed the difference between the purchase price and the amount of money for which CitiFinancial sold the debt. Santander attempted to collect the debts. A suit was brought against Santander alleging a violation of the FDCPA.

In 2016, the library contained over 4.7 million books, 10.6 million total materials, and served over 10,000 patrons each day. The HBLL was ranked by the Princeton Review within the top three university libraries in the United States three times: in 2004, 2007, and 2012. History Heber J. Grant Library, now a testing center A collection of books in Karl G. Maeser‚Äôs office served as the first library at Brigham Young Academy. In 1891, the library moved to a room in the Education Building in the lower campus, which expanded to include Room D about 1906. George Q. Cannon and Reed Smoot helped to acquire documents from the U.S. Department of the Interior and congressional documents. A fire in 1884 destroyed at least forty volumes of the collection. Students rarely checked out books in the early 1900s, generally studying books in the library instead. The Dewey Decimal Classification system was introduced to the library in 1908. English professor Alice Louise Reynolds helped raise funds to purchase over 1,000 books for the library. She was the faculty chair of a committee to establish the library from 1906 to 1925. The library contained 29,592 volumes by 1923‚Äîalmost half of them donated‚Äîand students had to stand in the library for lack of study space Reynolds' fan club donated over 10,000 volumes in the 1930s. By 1946, the library contained 138,500 volumes of books. The Heber J. Grant Library was completed in 1925. In the Grant Library, reference books were placed on shelves surrounding the study area, with the rest of the library's holdings on shelves in the book room. Students would find books they wanted in the catalog, and library pages would retrieve them. The library increased the volume of acquisitions during the 1930s and 1940s, and gifts of books were indiscriminately accepted. This policy changed in 1958, when gifts became subject to a consultation with the Director of Libraries, S. Lyman Tyler. In his time as director from 1954 to 1966, Tyler met Keyes Metcalf at a seminar for library administrators. Metcalf was the former director of the Harvard Library, and consulted with Tyler about the plans for BYU's new library. BYU commissioned Lorenzo Snow Young to make the plans for addition. The J. Reuben Clark Library was completed in 1961. The library's collection reached 500,000 volumes in 1965, and one million volumes by 1971. The name of library changed in 1974 from the J. Reuben Clark Library to the Harold B. Lee Library to avoid confusion with the J. Reuben Clark Law School. Harold B. Lee was the 11th president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A six-story addition was completed in 1976, doubling the library's physical space and increasing the library's seating capacity from 2,500 to 4,500. The addition had moveable walls, integrated student study spaces into the stacks, added group study rooms, and included a vault for archival materials. Art professor and artist Franz M. Johansen created four cast stone panels used to decorate the south entrance of the library and representing four areas of human knowledge. The HBLL was again expanded and remodeled in the mid‚Äì and late‚Äì1990s using donated funds, adding , technology classrooms, an auditorium, and a digitization center. After the expansion, parts of the old library were remodeled, and the south entrance was closed. A new south entrance was opened in 2015. From 2001 to 2011, the Interlibrary Loan program processed 500,000 requests. The library contained over 4.7 million books and served an average of 10,191 patrons a day during 2016. Single-user study rooms were added in 2017, and construction started on a family-friendly study room. =Technological improvements= The HBLL started offering a dial-up access system in 1969 for patrons to access music, lectures, and foreign language recordings, and access to the Library Information Network Center (LINC) was offered in 1974. Through a keyword search, patrons could use the system to search bibliographic resources of articles and recent books from ProQuest Dialog and Orbit II. The library adopted 3M Tattle-Tape in 1975 to detect if patrons were removing books from the library that had not been checked out. The library renamed their NOTIS cataloging system in 1984 to the Brigham Young University Information Network (BYLINE), and ran it on a mainframe computer located in the James E. Talmage Building. The library collection began being re-catalogued in 1995 from the Dewey Decimal Classification system to the Library of Congress Classification. found in A word processing center in the library made 25 computers available to students at the rate of $1 per hour in 1996. In 1997, the library switched from using the DOS-based BYLINE to the Windows-based Horizon Automated Library Systems. The Horizon system allowed users to access online catalogs from other libraries, and used a client-server model. The library contained 200 computers but only a portion of them had internet access in 1997. The library launched an online library catalog in 1998 after integrating the search system, providing online renewals and extending undergraduate checkout times. An electronic reserve system with an additional server was added in 1999. The library added wireless internet access points to its study spaces in 2003. =Library instruction= The HBLL instituted a summer program to certify students as school librarians in 1938, later offering the program during the school year. A class on bookbinding was taught during the 1940s. The BYU School of Library and Information Science was established in 1966 and re-accredited in 1978. It had about 50 graduates a year. Prior to this program, Mary Elizabeth Downey taught a six-week class on the use of libraries. The School of Library and Information Science was closed in 1993, despite the program being in high demand. The closure occurred after the administration announced a renewed focus on undergraduate studies. found in Collections BYU Special Collections The HBLL includes a family history library, the Primrose International Viola Archive, the International Harp Archives, and serves as a designated depository of government documents. The juvenile literature department opened its Lloyd Alexander Collection in January 2010, featuring items from the author's home office for students and researchers to access. =Special collections= The library's special collections began in 1957 with 1000 books and 50 manuscript collections. A special vault and cold storage facility were built in 2000 and the collection was formally named the L. Tom Perry Special Collections Library. The collection at the time contained over 8000 manuscript collections, 500,000 photographs, and 280,000 books. Notable items from the collection include a 1967 Bible illustrated by Salvador Dal√≠, a 13th-century Vulgate, a first edition Book of Mormon, and the papers of Cecil B. DeMille and Helen Foster Snow. =Foreign language collections= The HBLL houses collections in many foreign languages. The collection includes a Welsh library originally sponsored in 1951 by the National Gymanfa Association of the United States and Canada. The Icelandic Library Association of Spanish Fork donated their collection of Icelandic books in 1951. =Religious influence on collections= Starting in 2004, R-rated movies were placed in the Faculty Use collection. The Romance section includes a guide with ratings for the amount of sexual content in the books, and novels with explicit sexual material are not included in the collection. Awards and recognition In 2004, the Princeton Review ranked the HBLL as the number one college library, and as number three in 2007 and 2012. The American Library Association awarded the HBLL with the Library Instruction Round Table 2017 Innovation in Instruction Award.

The game revolves around piracy and naval warfare.  Gameplay  The player sails past approaching enemy ships. Skull & Bones is a tactical action game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. Players take control of a customizable pirate captain, and may choose to sail the Indian Ocean by themselves and set off on a single-player campaign, or gather up to five other players to ally in player versus player gameplay in Disputed Waters. Wind positioning can be assessed to gain an advantage in battle. Players may collect additional ships throughout the game, such as sloops-of- war, frigates and brigantines, whose weapons include mortars, broadside cannons, and rockets. Ships can be charged into with brute force and boarded. The rate of inflicted damage is gauged by the health bar. A core component is the multiplayer mode Loot Hunt, where two groups of players are challenged in treasure hunting to further accumulate their riches. Each given ship's crow's nest is scalable for use as a lookout point and spyglasses can be availed of as well. Microtransactions will be an added feature. Development and release Skull & Bones is the first video game led by developer Ubisoft Singapore, which drew inspiration from the naval battles of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.

Upon the occurrence of plasmon coupling, the resonance of individual particles start to hybridize, and their resonance spectrum peak wavelength will either blueshift or redshift, depending on how surface charge density distributes over coupled particles. At single particle's resonance wavelength the surface charge densities of close particles can either be out of phase or in phase causing repulsion or attraction and thus leading to increase (blueshift) or decrease (redshift) of hybridized mode energy. The magnitude of the shift, which can be the measure of plasmon coupling, is dependent on the interparticle gap as well as particles geometry and plasmonic resonances supported by individual particles. A larger redshift is usually associated with smaller interparticle gap and larger cluster size. Plasmon coupling can also cause the electric field in the interparticle gap to be boosted by several orders of magnitude, which far-exceeds the field enhancement for a single plasmonic nanoparticle. Many sensing applications such as surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) utilize the plasmon coupling between nanoparticles to achieve ultralow detection limit.  Plasmon ruler  Plasmon ruler refers to a dimer of two identical plasmonic nanospheres linked together through a polymer, typically DNA or RNA. Based on the Universal Scaling Law between spectral shift and the interparticle separations, the nanometer scale distance can be monitored by the color shifts of dimer resonance peak. Plasmon rulers are typically used to monitor distance fluctuation below the diffraction limit, between tens of nanometers and a few nanometers.  Plasmon coupling microscopy  Plasmon coupling microscopy is a ratiometric widefield imaging approach that allows monitoring of multiple plasmon rulers with high temporal resolution. The entire field of view is imaged simultaneously on two wavelength channels, which corresponds to the red and blue flank of the plasmon ruler resonance. The spectral information of an individual plasmon ruler is expressed in the intensity distribution on the two monitored channels, quantified as R=(I1-I2)/(I1+I2). Each R value corresponds to a certain nanometer scale distance which can be calculated using computer simulation or generated from experiments.

He is a member of what has been described as the third generation of artists inspired in their painting style by Jack Bush. During the first part of his career, Cameron fashioned elegantly drawn shapes into abstractions; in the latter part of his career, influenced by Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven, he sought to delineate landscape in his semi-abstract work.  Biography  Cameron was raised in the scenic Georgian Bay area of Perry Sound, ON. His mother was a painter and his uncle was a designer in New York City. While visiting his uncle in New York City, Cameron was introduced to American abstract expressionist painting. Cameron studied at the New School of Art under Graham Coughtry, Gordon Rayner, Dennis Burton and Robert Markle. While in school, Cameron focused on formal planning and carefully drawn sketches before applying paint to a canvas. In his early career, Cameron worked as a studio assistant to Jack Bush from 1972 to 1976. Bush is said to have influenced Cameron's \\"lyrical semi-abstract painting style\\", as well as his thick impasto application of paint. Through Bush, Cameron met and maintained an ongoing, close relationship with the art critic Clement Greenberg. Inspired by Bush, Painters Eleven and the Group of Seven, Cameron's paintings primarily feature brightly colored, abstractions, which can be seen in his later work as landscapes. According to Cameron, he began his career as an artist in 1969. The artist's early works in the 1970s were \\"flat, unmodulated fields of color transversed by sketchy cartoon-like drawing\\". In the early 1980s Cameron's style developed into the \\"long horizontal and vertical lines of color punctuated by curves, squiggles and free hand geometry\\" that can be seen in his landscapes today. \\"The suggestion of trees or horizon is often roughly preserved but the real business of the paintings is the rhythm of line, mass, depth and color\\". What separates Cameron from other abstract artists is his concern with \\"creating the illusion of depth and dimension on a two-dimensional surface\\". He achieves this by creating a composition composed of a foreground, middle distance and distance. The distance usually contains a sunlit cloud-filled sky, the middle distance shows the watery surface of lakes or streams with a mountainous shore beyond. The foreground typically displays rocks, earth and vegetation. Speaking of his own compositions, Alex Cameron describes his skies as \\"color fields\\", explaining that he \\"has a sky just so [he] can stick stuff in it\\". Today, Cameron spends his time painting going back and forth between landscapes and abstracts. This explains why abstract elements can often be found in the artist's landscapes. With increased impasto, Cameron paints by \\"squeezing paint out of tubes in finger-width squiggles, dashes and dots\\". The artist churns out, on average, one painting a week, but is able to create pieces from start to finish very quickly. He has been known to finish a 6 x 6 ft. work in one day. All of Cameron's titles are invented after the work is completed. His process is a combination of painting en plein air and using his minds eye to create his brightly coloured landscapes. Cameron travels to the remote areas of the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, British Columbia, Algonquin Park, Newfoundland, India and Nepal for inspiration. If he is able, he will paint on the spot, or make tiny watercolour sketches to later work up in his Toronto studio. Alternatively, he holds onto the images from his travels in his mind and transfers them to canvas, choosing the colours to portray the scenes in a different light. Cameron never paints from photographs, as he says they \\"give you too much information\\". Cameron has had over 40 solo exhibitions since his first show at A Space Gallery in Toronto in 1971. Cameron's work is in the permanent collections of the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Agnes Etherington Art Centre in Kingston, ON, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa, and the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada, as well as numerous corporate and private collections. The 1970s were a momentous time in Alex Cameron's career. Cameron met Queen Elizabeth II of England during the 25th Jubilee celebrations and one of his paintings was presented to the queen as a gift. Alex Cameron's work is represented by Bau-Xi Gallery in Toronto and Vancouver, Oeno Gallery in Bloomfield in Prince Edward County, Giordano Gallery in Edmonton, and Thielsen Galleries in London (Canada).

In many theories, and in many experimental measurements, the plot is linear. The use of Mott‚ÄìSchottky plots to determine system properties (such as flatband potential, doping density or Helmholtz capacitance) is termed Mott‚ÄìSchottky analysis. Figure 1. (a) Shows an energy diagram of n-type semiconductor in contact with redox electrolyte at the left side (yellow), and with a metallic ohmic contact at the right side. Ec is the conduction band edge energy, Ev is the valence band energy of the semiconductor. By equilibration of the Fermi level in the semiconductor, EF, and the redox energy of electrolyte, Eredox, a Schottky barrier is formed at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. The vertical size of the barrier in the energy diagram corresponds to the built-in potential Vbi. In the spatial axis the equilibration of Fermi levels produces a space charge region or depletion region of size w. A positive voltage applied to the back contact in (b) raises the Fermi level of electrons EFn, and decreases the size of the depletion region. Consequently, the capacitance of the junction increases, and the reciprocal square capacitance decreases forming a linear Mott‚ÄìSchottky plot in (c). The intercept with the x-axis shows the flatband situation, that reveals the built-in potential, depending on the reference of voltage in the electrolyte side. (d) In the presence of a surface state of density Nss, when the Fermi level reaches the bandgap state level, it is discharged and a plateau occurs depending on the value of the Helmholtz layer capacitance CH at the electrolyte side of the junction. When the surface state is charged the Mott‚ÄìSchottky lines continues, but the flatband potential is modified according to the extend of unpinning of the Fermi level. Adapted from Figure 2. Mott‚ÄìSchottky plot of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) semiconductor electrode measured in aqueous electrolyte at different pH, with respect to standard Ag/AgCl electrode. Changing the pH modifies the apparent flatband potential by 570 mV corresponding to a 59 mV displacement per unit of pH. From the slope the donor density ND = 1.1 x 1021 cm‚àí3 is determined. Then the same sample is measured after nanostructured TiO2 is deposited on top of FTO. The observed change of slope is due to the decrease of the surface in direct contact with the electrolyte. Consider the semiconductor/electrolyte junction shown in Figure 1. Under applied bias voltage V the size of the depletion layer w is w={\\\\left\\\\lbrack \\\\frac{2\\\\varepsilon }{{\\\\mathit{q}}{\\\\mathit{N}}_{D}}\\\\left(V+{V}_{\\\\text{bi}}\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\rbrack }^{1/2} (1) Here \\\\varepsilon=\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0 is the permittivity, q is the elementary charge, {N}_{D} is the doping density, {V}_{\\\\text{bi}} is the built-in potential. The depletion region contains positive charge compensated by ionic negative charge at the semiconductor surface (in the liquid electrolyte side). Charge separation forms a dielectric capacitor at the interface of the metal/semiconductor contact. We calculate the capacitance for an electrode area A as C=\\\\frac{\\\\partial Q}{\\\\partial V}={\\\\mathit{q}}{\\\\mathit{N}}_{D}A\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial V} (2) replacing \\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial V} as obtained from equation 1, the result of the capacitance per unit area is C=A\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon }{w} (3) a equation describing the capacitance of a capacitor constructed of two parallel plates both of area A separated by a distance w . Replacing equation (3) in (1) we obtain the result {C}^{-2}=\\\\frac{2}{{\\\\mathit{qA}}^{2}{\\\\mathit{\\\\varepsilon N}}_{D}}\\\\left(V+{V}_{\\\\text{bi}}\\\\right) (4). Therefore, a representation of the reciprocal square capacitance, is a linear function of the voltage, which constitutes the Mott‚ÄìSchottky plot as shown in Fig. 1c. The measurement of the Mott‚ÄìSchottky plot brings us two important pieces of information. # The slope gives the doping (semiconductor) density (provided that the dielectric constant is known). # The intercept to the x axis provides the built-in potential, or the flatband potential (as here the surface barrier has been flattened) and allows establishing the semiconductor conduction band level with respect to the reference of potential. In liquid junction the reference of potential is normally a standard reference electrode. In solid junctions, we can take as a reference the metal Fermi level, if the work function is known, which provides a full energy diagram in the physical scale. The Mott‚ÄìSchottky plot is sensitive to the electrode surface in contact with solution, see Figure 2. A more accurate analysis considering the statistics of electrons provides the following result for the size of the depletion region w={\\\\left\\\\lbrack \\\\frac{2\\\\varepsilon }{{\\\\mathit{qN}}_{D}}\\\\left({V}_{\\\\text{bi}}+V-\\\\frac{{k}_{B}T}{q}\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\rbrack }^{1/2}(5) in this case the Mott‚ÄìSchottky equation is {C}^{-2}=\\\\frac{2}{{\\\\mathit{qA}}^{2}{\\\\mathit{\\\\varepsilon N}}_{D}}\\\\left({V}_{\\\\text{bi}}+V-\\\\frac{{k}_{B}T}{q}\\\\right)(6) When the interfacial barrier is of the order {k}_{B}T, special care has to be taken to interpret the capacitance measurement. In fact at these small voltages the capacitance makes a peak that can be used for the determination of the built- in voltage. The Mott‚ÄìSchottky analysis can more generally resolve a variable doping profile in the semiconductor as follows \\\\frac{d\\\\left({C}^{-2}\\\\right)}{\\\\text{d}\\\\mathit{V}}=\\\\frac{2}{{\\\\mathit{qA}}^{2}{\\\\mathit{\\\\varepsilon N}}_{D}\\\\left(w\\\\right)}(7) The derivative gives the doping at the edge of the depletion region, {N}_{D}\\\\left(w\\\\right). This method only provides a spatial resolution of the order of a Debye length {\\\\lambda }_{D}systems where more than one process gives a substantial kinetic response, it is necessary to adopt Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy that resolves the different capacitances in the system. For example, in the presence of a surface state at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, the spectra show two arcs, one at low frequency and another one at high frequency. The depletion capacitance leading to Mott‚ÄìSchottky plot is situated in the high frequency arc, as the depletion capacitance is a dielectric capacitance. On the other hand, the low frequency feature corresponds to the chemical capacitance of the surface states. The surface state charging produces a plateau as indicated in Fig. 1d. Similarly, defect levels in the gap affect the changes of capacitance and conductance. Another widely used method to scan deep levels in Schottky barriers is termed admittance spectroscopy and consists on measuring the capacitance at a fixed frequency while varying the temperature. Surface photovoltage technique is used to determine the position of the band edges.

However, arriving at the KGB station, HƒÅzners was arrested and isolated. The KGB questioned him and demanded he identify anti-Soviet elements, but HƒÅzners refused. He was taken away and incarcerated at the Central Prison, where he was threatened, beaten, and forced to affix his signature to his own death sentence.

Regiment as regiment commander adjutant. He was appointed commander of I. Battalion on 6 March 1944 but reassigned as commander of III. Battalion on 13 April. That mid-July the 32. Regiment was forced to retreat from positions in Opochka along the banks of the Velikaya River; the battalion was reorganized as part of the KƒÅrlis AperƒÅts battle group. On 18 July 1944, battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel AperƒÅts was mortally wounded in battle near the town of Mozulyu and handed his command over to HƒÅzners, who with the five dozen or so surviving soldiers and officers he now led managed to cross a swamp and break out from the Russian forces surrounding them. For his heroism, HƒÅzners was awarded the Ehrenblatt des Heeres (Honour Roll Clasp of the Army). On 20 August 1944, HƒÅzners was redeployed to Germany with the remnants of 32. Regiment, where he was promoted to the rank of major and appointed commander of the 15. Fusiliers Battalion. On 26 January 1945, HƒÅzners was wounded in action at Immenheim and sent to Denmark for recovery, where he remained until the end of the war. Life after WWII Following the war, HƒÅzners was housed with other Latvian POWs at the Zedelgem prisoner-of-war camp in Belgium, where he was one of the founders of the Daugavas Vanagi welfare organization. Subsequently, he participated in training war invalids, helping approximately 500 take up useful trades and occupations. HƒÅzners was active in the exile Latvian-American community. He served as the president of the Latvian National Committee (1948-1951), from 1951 editing the Daugavas Vanagi monthly newsletter, eventually serving as the organization's general-secretary. In 1977, based on KGB-fabricated documents, HƒÅzners was accused of active participation in the Holocaust. At the time, he was living in upstate New York, where Fredric U. Dicker, a columnist for the Times Union, revealed his identity. HƒÅzners was acquitted after neither the Immigration and Naturalization Service nor the Office of Special Investigation (OSI) were able to provide evidence.Andrew Ezergailis - Six versions of the Holocaust in Latvia - Latvijas Vƒìsturnieku komisijas raksti - Holokausts LatvijƒÅ, Rƒ´ga: 2006, Volume 18, page 79 HƒÅzners died 12 May 1989 in the United States and his remains buried in Latvia in Bƒìrzkrogs Cemetery.Daugavas Vanagi.

They were first mentioned as being located in Paropamisus, and later expanded south-east, into the Punjab and central India, as far as Eran and Kausambi. The Alchon invasion of the Indian subcontinent eradicated the Kidarite Huns who had preceded them by about a century, and contributed to the fall of the Gupta Empire, in a sense bringing an end to Classical India.\\"The Alchon Huns....established themselves as overlords of northwestern India, and directly contributed to the downfall of the Guptas\\" in The invasion of India by the Huna peoples follows invasions of the subcontinent in the preceding centuries by the Yavana (Indo-Greeks), the Saka (Indo-Scythians), the Palava (Indo-Parthians), and the Kushana (Yuezhi). The Alchon Empire was the third of four major Huna states established in Central and South Asia. The Alchon were preceded by the Kidarites and succeeded by the Hephthalites in Bactria and the Nezak Huns in the Hindu Kush. The names of the Alchon kings are known from their extensive coinage, Buddhist accounts, and a number of commemorative inscriptions throughout the Indian subcontinent. The Alchons have long been considered as a part or a sub-division of the Hephthalites, or as their eastern branch, but now tend to be considered as a separate entity.\\"Note 8: It is now clear that the Hephtalites were not part of those Huns who conquered the land south of the Hindu-Kush and Sind as well in the early 6th century. In fact, this latter Hunnic group was the one commonly known as Alkhon because of the inscriptions on their coins (Vondrovec, 2008).\\" in  Name  To contemporaneous observers in India, the Alchon were one of the H≈´·πáa peoples (or Hunas), whose origins are controversial. A seal from Kausambi associated with Toramana, bears the title H≈´narƒÅja (\\"Huna King\\"). Toramana is also described as a Huna (14px17px H≈´·πáƒÅ) in the Rishtal inscription. Greco-Bactrian cursive script, on a coin of Khingila.CNG Coins The Hunas appear to have been the peoples known in contemporaneous Iranian sources as Xwn, Xiyon and similar names, which were later Romanised as Xionites or Chionites. The Hunas are often linked to the Huns that invaded Europe from Central Asia during the same period. Consequently, the word Hun has three slightly different meanings, depending on the context in which it is used: 1) the Huns of Europe; 2) groups associated with the Huna people who invaded northern India; 3) a vague term for Hun-like people. The Alchon have also been labelled \\"Huns\\", with essentially the second meaning, as well as elements of the third. The name \\"Alchon\\" generally given to them comes from the Bactrian legend of their early coinage, where they simply imitated Sassanian coins to which they added the name \\"alchono\\" (Œ±ŒªœáŒøŒΩŒø, also Œ±ŒªœáŒøŒΩŒΩŒø) in Bactrian script (a slight adaptation of the Greek script) and the tamgha symbol of their clan.For one of these coins30pxKhingila with the word \\"Alchono\\" in the Bactrian script (Œ±ŒªœáŒøŒΩŒø) and the Tamgha symbol on his coins CNG Coins. Several original coins such as those of Khingila also bear the mention \\"alchono\\" together with the Tamgha symbol. Philologically, \\"alchono\\" (Œ±ŒªœáŒøŒΩŒø) may be a combination of al- for Aryan and -xono for Huns, although this remains hypothetical. Another etymology could be al-, Turkish for scarlet, and -xono for Huns, meaning \\"Red Huns\\", red being a symbol of the south among steppe nomads.  History  =Invasion of Bactria (370 CE)= During the reign of Shapur II, the Sasanian Empire and the Kushano-Sasanians gradually lost the control of Bactria to these invaders from Central Asia, first the Kidarites from around 335 CE, then the Alchon Huns from around 370 CE, who would follow up with the invasion of India a century later, and lastly the Hephthalites from around 450 CE. Early confrontations between the Sasanian Empire of Shapur II with the nomadic hordes from Central Asia called the \\"Chionites\\" were described by Ammianus Marcellinus: he reports that in 356 CE, Shapur II was taking his winter quarters on his eastern borders, \\"repelling the hostilities of the bordering tribes\\" of the Chionites and the Euseni (\\"Euseni\\" is usually amended to \\"Cuseni\\", meaning the Kushans),Ammianus Marcellinus, Roman History. London: Bohn (1862) XVI-IX finally making a treaty of alliance with the Chionites and the Gelani, \\"the most warlike and indefatigable of all tribes\\", in 358 CE.Ammianus Marcellinus, Roman History. London: Bohn (1862) XVII-V After concluding this alliance, the Chionites (probably of the Kidarites tribe) under their King Grumbates accompanied Shapur II in the war against the Romans, especially at the Siege of Amida in 359 CE. Victories of the Xionites during their campaigns in the Eastern Caspian lands were also witnesses and described by Ammianus Marcellinus.History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Ahmad Hasan Dani, B. A. Litvinsky, Unesco p.38 sq The Alchon Huns occupied Bactria circa 370 CE, where they started minting coins in the style of Shapur II but bearing their name \\"Alchono\\", and emerged in Kapisa around 380, taking over Kabulistan from the Sassanian Persians, at the same time the Kidarites (Red Huns) still ruled in Ghandara. The Alchon Huns are said to have taken control of Kabul in 388. The Alchon Huns initially issued anonymous coins based on Sasanian designs. Several types of these coins are known, usually minted in Bactria, using Sasanian coinage designs with busts imitating Sasanian kings Shapur II (r.309 to 379 CE) and Shapur III (r.383 to 388 CE), adding the Alchon Tamgha 16px and the name \\"Alchono\\" (Œ±ŒªœáŒøŒΩŒΩŒø) in Bactrian script (a slight adaptation of the Greek script which had been introduced in the region by the Greco-Bactrians in the 3rd century BCE) on the obverse, and with attendants to a fire altar, a standard Sasanian design, on the reverse.CNG Coins It is thought the Alchons took over the Sasanian mints in Kabulistan after 385 CE, reusing dies of Shapur II and Shapur III, to which they added the name \\"Alchono\\". =Gandhara (460 CE)= Around 430 King Khingila, the most notable Alchon ruler, and the first one to be named and represented on his coins with the legend \\"œáŒπŒ≥Œ≥ŒπŒªŒø\\" (Kiggilo) in Bactrian, emerged and took control of the routes across the Hindu Kush from the Kidarites. He seems to have been a contemporary of the Sassanian ruler Bahram V. As the Alchons took control, diplomatic missions were established in 457 with China. Khingila, under the name Shengil, was called \\"King of India\\" in the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi. Alchon ruler Mehama (r.461-493) was elevated to the position of Governor for Sasanian Emperor Peroz I (r. 459-484), and described himself as \\"King of the people of Kadag and governor of the famous and prosperous King of Kings Peroz\\" in a 462-463 letter. He allied with Peroz I in his victory over the Kidarites in 466 CE, and may also have helped him take the throne against his brother Hormizd III. But he was later able to wrestle autonomy or even independence. Between 460 and 470 CE, the Alchons took over Gandhara and the Punjab which also had remained under the control of the Kidarites, while the Gupta Empire remained further east. The numismatic evidence as well as the so-called \\"Hephthalite bowl\\" from Gandhara, now in the British Museum, suggests a period of peaceful coexistence between the Kidarites and the Alchons, as it features two Kidarite noble hunters wearing their characteristic crowns, together with two Alchon hunters and one of the Alchons inside a medallion. At one point, the Kidarites withdrew from Gandhara, and the Alchons took over their mints from the time of Khingila. The Alchons apparently undertook the mass destruction of Buddhist monasteries and stupas at Taxila, a high center of learning, which never recovered from the destruction. Virtually all of the Alchon coins found in the area of Taxila were found in the ruins of burned down monasteries, where apparently some of the invaders died alongside local defenders during the wave of destructions. It is thought that the Kanishka stupa, one of the most famous and tallest buildings in antiquity, was destroyed by them during their invasion of the area in the 460s CE. The rest of the 5th century marks a period of territorial expansion and eponymous kings, several of which appear to have overlapped and ruled jointly.\\"Here, for the first time, the names of Hepthalite (Alchon) kings are given, some of them otherwise known only from coins. Another important fact is that it dates all these kings in the same time.\\" from The Alchon Huns invaded parts of northwestern India from the second half of the 5th century. According to the Bhitari pillar inscription, the Gupta ruler Skandagupta already confronted and defeated an unnamed Huna ruler circa 456-457 CE. =Sindh= Uncertain Hunnic chieftain. Sindh. 5th century. From circa 480 CE, there are also suggestion of Hunnic occupation of Sindh, between Multan and the mouth of the Indus river, as the local Sasanian coinage of Sindh starts to incorporate sun symbols or a Hunnic tamgha to the design. These little-known coins are usually described as the result of the invasions of the \\"Hephthalites\\". The quality of the coins also becomes very much degraded by that time, and the actual gold content becomes quite low compared to the previous Sasanian-style coinage.  Contributions  The H≈´·πáas were precisely ruling the area of Malwa, at the doorstep of the Western Deccan, at the time the famous Ajanta caves were made by ruler Harisena of the Vakataka Empire. Through their control of vast areas of northwestern India, the Huns may actually have acted as a cultural bridge between the area of Gandhara and the Western Deccan, at the time when the Ajanta or Pitalkhora caves were being decorated with designs of Gandharan inspiration, such as Buddhas dressed in robes with abundant folds. =First Hunnic War: Central India= In the First Hunnic War (496‚Äì515), the Alchon reached their maximum territorial extent, with King Toramana pushing deep into Indian territory, reaching Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh in Central India, and ultimately contributing to the downfall of the Gupta Empire. To the south, the Sanjeli inscriptions indicate that Toramana penetrated at least as far as northern Gujarat, and possibly to the port of Bharukaccha. To the east, far into Central India, the city of Kausambi, where seals with Toramana's name were found, was probably sacked by the Alkhons in 497‚Äì500, before they moved to occupy Malwa. In particular, it is thought that the monastery of Ghoshitarama in Kausambi was destroyed by Toramana, as several of his seals were found there, one of them bearing the name Toramana impressed over the official seal of the monastery, and the other bearing the title H≈´narƒÅja (\\"King of the Huns\\"), together with debris and arrowheads. Another seal, this time by Mihirakula, is reported from Kausambi. These territories may have been taken from Gupta Emperor Budhagupta. Alternatively, they may have been captured during the rule of his successor Narasimhagupta. First Battle of Eran (510 CE) A decisive battle occurred in Malwa, where a local Gupta ruler, probably a governor, named Bhanugupta was in charge. In the Bhanugupta Eran inscription, this local ruler reports that his army participated in a great battle in 510 CE at Eran, where it suffered severe casualties. Bhanugupta was probably vanquished by Toramana at this battle, so that the western Gupta province of Malwa fell into the hands of the Hunas. Portrait of Toramana and Gupta script initials 12px15px Tora, from his bronze coinage. He sacked Kausambi and occupied Malwa. According to a 6th-century CE Buddhist work, the Manjusri-mula-kalpa, Bhanugupta lost Malwa to the \\"Shudra\\" Toramana, who continued his conquest to Magadha, forcing Narasimhagupta Baladitya to make a retreat to Bengal. Toramana \\"possessed of great prowess and armies\\" then conquered the city of Tirtha in the Gauda country (modern Bengal).\\"After the successful conclusion of the Eran episode, the conquering Hunas ultimately burst out of Eastern Malwa and swooped down upon the very heart of the Gupta empire. The eastern countries were overrun and the city of the Gaudas was occupied. The Manjusrimulakalpa gives a scintillating account of this phase of Toramana‚Äôs conquest. It says that after Bhanugupta's defeat and discomfiture, Toramana led the Hunas against Magadha and obliged Baladitya (Narasimha-gupta Baladitya, the reigning Gupta monarch) to retire to Bengal. This great monarch (Toramana), Sudra by caste and possessed of great prowess and armies took hold of that position (bank of the Ganges) and commanded the country round about. That powerful king then invested the town called Tirtha in the Gauda country.\\" in Toramana is said to have crowned a new king in Benares, named Prakataditya, who is also presented as a son of Narasimha Gupta. Having conquered the territory of Malwa from the Guptas, Toramana was mentioned in a famous inscription in Eran, confirming his rule on the region. The Eran boar inscription of Toramana (in Eran, Malwa, 540 km south of New Delhi, state of Madhya Pradesh) of his first regnal year indicates that eastern Malwa was included in his dominion. The inscription is written under the neck of the boar, in 8 lines of Sanskrit in the Brahmi script. The first line of the inscription, in which Toramana is introduced as Mahararajadhidaja (The Great King of Kings), reads: On his gold coins minted in India in the style of the Gupta Emperors, Toramana presented himself confidently as: The fact that the Alchon Huns issued gold coins, such as the Toramana issue, in addition to their silver and copper coins, suggest that their empire in India was quite rich and powerful.\\"This makes it quite clear that the Alchon Huns in India must have had a substantial and rich empire, with the capacity to issue a relatively large volume of gold coins.\\" in Full article Defeat (515 CE) Toramana was finally defeated by local Indian rulers. The local ruler Bhanugupta is sometimes credited with vanquishing Toramana, as his 510 CE inscription in Eran, recording his participation in \\"a great battle\\", is vague enough to allow for such an interpretation. The \\"great battle\\" in which Bhanagupta participated is not detailed, and it is impossible to know what it was, or which way it ended, and interpretations vary. Mookerji and others consider, in view of the inscription as well as the Manjusri-mula-kalpa, that Bhanugupta was, on the contrary, vanquished by Toramana at the 510 CE Eran battle, so that the western Gupta province of Malwa fell into the hands of the Hunas at that point, so that Toramana could be mentioned in the Eran boar inscription, as the ruler of the region. Toramana was finally vanquished with certainty by an Indian ruler of the Aulikara dynasty of Malwa, after nearly 20 years in India. According to the Rƒ´sthal stone-slab inscription, discovered in 1983, King Prakashadharma defeated Toramana in 515 CE. The First Hunnic War thus ended with a Hunnic defeat, and Hunnic troops apparently retreated to the area of Punjab. The Manjusri-mula-kalpa simply states that Toramana died in Benares as he was returning westward from his battles with Narasimhagupta. =Second Hunnic War: to Malwa and retreat= Mihirakula on one of his coins. He was finally defeated in 528 by King Yasodharman. The Second Hunnic War started in 520, when the Alchon king Mihirakula, son of Toramana, is recorded in his military encampment on the borders of the Jhelum by Chinese monk Song Yun. At the head of the Alchon, Mihirakula is then recorded in Gwalior, Central India as \\"Lord of the Earth\\" in the Gwalior inscription of Mihirakula. According to some accounts, Mihirakula invaded India as far as the Gupta capital Pataliputra, which was sacked and left in ruins. The destructions of Mihirakula are also recorded in the Rajatarangini: Finally however, Mihirakula was defeated in 528 by an alliance of Indian principalities led by Yasodharman, the Aulikara king of Malwa, in the battle of Sondani in Central India, which resulted in the loss of Alchon possessions in the Punjab and north India by 542. The Sondani inscription in Sondani, near Mandsaur, records the submission by force of the Hunas, and claims that Yasodharman had rescued the earth from rude and cruel kings,\\"The earth betook itself (for succour), when it was afflicted by kings of the present age, who manifested pride; who were cruel through want of proper training; who,from delusion, transgressed the path of good conduct; (and) who were destitute of virtuous delights \\" from and that he \\"had bent the head of Mihirakula\\". In a part of the Sondani inscription Yasodharman thus praises himself for having defeated king Mihirakula:Coin Cabinet of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna Mihirakula used the Indian Gupta script on his coinage. Obv: Bust of king, with legend in Gupta script (14px)14px16px14px18px12px16px14px,The \\"h\\" (12px) is an early variant of the Gupta script, seen for example in the Chandragupta type (Ja)yatu Mihirakula (\\"Let there be victory to Mihirakula\\").The \\"h\\" (12px) is an early variant of the Gupta script, seen for example in the Chandragupta type Rev: Dotted border around Fire altar flanked by attendants, a design adopted from Sasanian coinage. also Coinindia Alchon Coins (for an exact description of this coin type) The Gupta Empire emperor Narasimhagupta is also credited in helping repulse Mihirakula, after the latter had conquered most of India, according to the reports of Chinese monk Xuanzang. In a fanciful account, Xuanzang, who wrote a century later in 630 CE, reported that Mihirakula had conquered all India except for an island where the king of Magadha named Baladitya (who could be Gupta ruler Narasimhagupta Baladitya) took refuge, but that was finally captured by the Indian king. He later spared Mihirakula's life on the intercession of his mother, as she perceived the Hun ruler \\"as a man of remarkable beauty and vast wisdom\\". Mihirakula is then said to have returned to Kashmir to retake the throne. This ended the Second Hunnic War in 534, after an occupation which lasted nearly 15 years. =Retreat to Gandhara and Kashmir (530 CE)= Coinage of Sri Pravarasena, successor of Mihirakula, and supposed founder of Srinagar. Obverse: Standing king with two figured seated below. Name \\"Pravarasena\\". Reverse: goddess seated on a lion. Legend \\"KidƒÅra\\". Circa 6th-early 7th century CE The Alchon Huns resettled in the area of Gandhara and Kashmir in northwestern India under the rule of Sri Pravarasena (c.530-590 CE), thought to be the son of Toramana. His reign probably lasted about 60 years from circa 530 CE. According to Kalhana's 12th century text Rajatarangini, Pravarasena established a new capital named Pravarapura (also known as Pravarasena-pura). Based on topographical details, Pravarapura appears to be same as the modern city of Srinagar. He also built a temple named \\"Pravaresha\\". Portrait of Narendraditya Khinkhila, from his coinage. Pravarasena was probably succeeded by a king named Gokarna, a follower of Shiva, and then by his son king Narendraditya Khinkhila. The son of Narendraditya was Yudhishthira, who succeeded him as king, and was the last known king of the Alchon Huns. According to the Rajatarangini, Yudhishthira ruled 40 years until circa 670 CE, but he was dethroned by Pratapaditya, son of the founder of the Karko·π≠a Empire, Durlabhvardhana. =Retreat to Kabulistan= Alchon-Nezak \\"crossover coinage\\", 580‚Äì680. Nezak-style bust on the obverse, and Alchon tamga 15px within double border on the reverse.CNG Coins Around the end of the 6th century CE, the Alchons withdrew to Kashmir and, pulling back from Punjab and Gandhara, moved west across the Khyber pass where they resettled in Kabulistan. There, their coinage suggests that they merged with the Nezak ‚Äì as coins in Nezak style now bear the Alchon tamga mark.Coin Cabinet of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna During the 7th century, continued military encounters are reported between the Hunas and the northern Indian states which followed the disappearance of the Gupta Empire. For example, Prabhakaravardhana, the Vardhana dynasty king of Thanesar in northern India and father of Harsha, is reported to have been \\"A lion to the Huna deer, a burning fever to the king of the Indus land\\". The Alchons in India declined rapidly around the same time that the Hephthalites, a related group to the north, were defeated by an alliance between the Sassanians and the Western Turkic Kaghanate. Eventually, the Nezak-Alchons were replaced by the Turk shahi dynasty. Religion and ethics The period of Huna rule corresponds to the last stages of Greco-Buddhist art. 7th century, Ghorband District, Afghanistan. The four Alchon kings Khingila, Toramana, Javukha, and Mehama are mentioned as donors to a Buddhist stupa in the Talagan copper scroll inscription dated to 492 or 493 CE, that is, at a time before the Hunnic wars in India started. This corresponds to a time when the Alchons had recently taken control of Taxila (around 460 CE), at the center of the Buddhist regions of northwestern India. =Persecution of Buddhism= Meditating Buddha from Sarnath, Gupta era, 5th century CE. Later, however, the attitude of the Alchons towards Buddhism is reported to have been negative. Mihirakula in particular is remembered by Buddhist sources to have been a \\"terrible persecutor of their religion\\" in Gandhara in northern Pakistan. During his reign, over one thousand Buddhist monasteries throughout Gandhara are said to have been destroyed. In particular, the writings of Chinese monk Xuanzang from 630 CE explained that Mihirakula ordered the destruction of Buddhism and the expulsion of monks. Indeed, the Buddhist art of Gandhara, in particular Greco-Buddhist art, becomes essentially extinct around that period. When Xuanzang visited northwestern India in CE, he reported that Buddhism had drastically declined, and that most of the monasteries were deserted and left in ruins. Although the Guptas were traditionally a Brahmanical dynasty, around the period of the invasions of the Alchon the Gupta rulers had apparently been favouring Buddhism. According to contemporary writer Paramartha, Mihirakula's supposed nemesis Narasimhagupta Baladitya was brought up under the influence of the Mahayanist philosopher Vasubandhu. He built a sangharama at Nalanda and a high vihara with a Buddha statue within which, according to Xuanzang, resembled the \\"great Vihara built under the Bodhi tree\\". According to the Manjushrimulakalpa (c. 800 CE), king Narasimhsagupta became a Buddhist monk, and left the world through meditation (Dhyana). Xuanzang also noted that Narasimhagupta Baladitya's son Vajra, who also commissioned a sangharama, \\"possessed a heart firm in faith\\". The 12th century Kashmiri historian Kalhana also painted a dreary picture of Mihirakula's cruelty, as well as his persecution of the Buddhist faith: =Shivaism and Sun cult= The Alchons are generally described as sun worshipers, a traditional cult of steppe nomads. This stems from the appearance of sun symbols on some of their coins, combined with the probable influence they received from the worship of Surya in India. Mihirakula is also said to have been an ardent worshiper of Shiva, although he may have been selectively attracted to the destructive powers of the Indian deity. Mihirakula is said to have been the founder of the Shankaracharya Temple, a shrine dedicated to Shiva in Srinagar,\\"He is credited with the building of the temple named Jyeshteswara on the Gopa (Sankaracharya) hill in Srinagar\\" in a shrine to Shiva named Mihiresvara in Halada, and a large city called Mihirapura. Consequences on India Alchon territories of Mihirakula, c. 500 CE (in green). The Alchon invasions, although only spanning a few decades, had long term effects on India, and in a sense brought an end to the middle kingdoms of India. Soon after the invasions, the Gupta Empire, already weakened by these invasions and the rise of local rulers, ended as well. Following the invasions, northern India was left in disarray, with numerous smaller Indian powers emerging after the crumbling of the Guptas. The Huna invasions are said to have seriously damaged India's trade with Europe and Central Asia, particularly Indo-Roman trade relations, which the Gupta Empire had greatly benefited from. The Guptas had been exporting numerous luxury products such as silk, leather goods, fur, iron products, ivory, pearl and pepper from centers such as Nasik, Paithan, Pataliputra and Benares. The Huna invasion probably disrupted these trade relations and the tax revenues that came with them. Furthermore, Indian urban culture was left in decline, and Buddhism, gravely weakened by the destruction of monasteries and the killing of monks, started to collapse. Great centers of learning were destroyed, such as the city of Taxila, bringing cultural regression. The art of Mathura suffered greatly from the destructions brought by the Hunas, as did the art of Gandhara in the northwest, and both schools of art were nearly wiped out under the rule of the Huna Mihirakula. During their rule of 60 years, the Alchons are said to have altered the hierarchy of ruling families and the Indian caste system. For example, the Hunas are often said to have become the precursors of the Rajputs. On the artistic side however, the Alchon Huns may have played a role, just like the Western Satraps centuries before them, in helping spread the art of Gandhara to the western Deccan region. =Coinage legacy (6th-12th century CE)= As they invaded northern and central India circa 500 CE, the Alchon Huns issued several types of coinage on the model of the Sasanian Empire, with ruler in profile on the obverse and sacred fire with attendants on the reverse. It is thought that in the process of minting coins in occupied lands, they transmitted Sasanian coin designs to northern and western India. This created a major type of Indian coinage called \\"Indo-Sasanian coinage\\", which lasted in degraded form until the 12th century CE as far as the Gangetic region. Sources The Talagan copper scroll Ancient sources refer to the Alchons and associated groups ambiguously with various names, such as Huna in Indian texts, and Xionites in Greek texts. Xuanzang chronicled some of the later history of the Alchons. Modern archeology has provided valuable insights into the history of the Alchons. The most significant cataloguing of the Alchon dynasty came in 1967 with Robert G√∂bl's analysis of the coinage of the \\"Iranian Huns\\". This work documented the names of a partial chronology of Alchon kings, beginning with Khingila. In 2012, the Kunsthistorisches Museum completed a reanalysis of previous finds together with a large number of new coins that appeared on the antiquities market during the Second Afghan Civil War, redefining the timeline and narrative of the Alchons and related peoples. =Talagan copper scroll= A significant contribution to our understanding of Alchon history came in 2006 when Gudrun Melzer and Lore Sander published their finding of the \\"Talagan copper scroll\\", also known as the \\"Sch√∏yen Copper Scroll\\", dated to 492 or 493, that mentions the four Alchon kings Khingila, Toramana, Javukha, and Mehama (who was reigning at the time) as donors to a Buddhist reliquary stupa.\\"Together with the great sahi Khingila, together with the god-king Toramana, together with the mistress of a great monastery Sasa, together with the great sahi Mehama, together with Sadavikha, together with the great king Javukha, the son of Sadavikha, during the reign of Mehama.\\"from For an image of the copper scroll: Coin Cabinet of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna Showcase 8 Rulers The rulers of the Alchons practiced skull deformation, as evidenced from their coins, a practice shared with the Huns that migrated into Europe. The names of the first Alchon rulers do not survive. Starting from 430 CE, names of Alchon kings survive on coins and religious inscriptions: * anonymous kings (400 - 430 CE) * Khingila (c. 430 ‚Äì 490 CE) * Javukha/Zabocho (c. mid 5th ‚Äì early 6th CE) * Mehama (c. 461 ‚Äì 493 CE) * Lakhana Udayaditya (c. 490's CE) * Aduman * Toramana (c. 490 ‚Äì 515 CE) * Mihirakula (c. 515 ‚Äì 540 CE) * Pravarasena (c. 530 ‚Äì 590 CE) * Toramana II (c. 530 ‚Äì 570 CE) * Gokarna (c. 570 ‚Äì 590 CE) * Narana/Narendra (c. 590 ‚Äì 630 CE) * Yudhishthira (630-670 CE) Coinage An early Alchon Huns coin based on a Sasanian design, with bust imitating Sasanian king Shapur III. Only the legend \\"Alchono\\" appears on the obverse in the Greco-Bactrian script. also Coinindia Alchon Coins (for an exact description of this coin type) ;Early Bactrian coinage based on Sasanian designs The earliest Alchon Hun coins were based on Sasanian designs, often with the simple addition of the Alchon tamgha and a mention of \\"Alchon\\" or \\"Alkhan\\". Various coins minted in Bactria and based on Sasanian designs are known, often with busts imitating Sasanian kings Shapur II (r.309 to 379 CE) and Shapur III (r.383 to 388 CE), with attendants to a fire altar on the reverse. It is thought that the Sasanids lost control of Bactria to the Kidarites during the reign of Shapur II circa 370 CE, followed by the Hephthalites, and subsequently by the Alchon. ;Later original coinage Later Alchon coinage became original and differed from predecessors in that it was devoid of Iranian (Sasanian) symbolism. The rulers are depicted with elongated skulls, apparently a result of artificial cranial deformation. After their invasion of India the coins of the Alchon were numerous and varied, as they issued copper, silver and gold coins, sometimes roughly following the Gupta pattern. The Alchon empire in India must have been quite significant and rich, with the ability to issue a significant volume of gold coins. =Main coin types= File:Toramana coin in Western Gupta style.jpgthumbSilver coin of Toramana in Western Gupta style, with the Gupta peacock and Brahmi legend on the reverse.

A previous chapel dedicated to Saint Nicholas was located in the area from at least the early 16th century, but it was deconsecrated in the 17th century. The present building was constructed between 1759 and 1762 in the Baroque style. Today, the chapel is located within the limits of Marsaskala, but it is administered by the parish of ≈ªabbar. History Notarial documents of the early 16th century suggest that a chapel dedicated to Saint Nicholas existed in the ≈ªonqor area. This chapel formed part of the parish of St. Catherine of ≈ªejtun, and it stood on land which belonged to Salvu Burl√≤. It was visited by Pietro Dusina in 1575, who found that the chapel had an altar but no door, and that it was undecorated. Burl√≤ was ordered to install a wooden door. This chapel was not well- maintained, and it was not used regularly, which resulted in it being profaned by Bishop Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa on 25 March 1659, and again by Lorenzo D'Astiria in 1666. It remained functional for a few more years, before being profaned for a third time by Bishop Miguel Jer√≥nimo de Molina on 25 March 1679. The present building was built by the lawyer Giovanni Battista Azzopardi Barbara, in order to fulfill the wish of his father, Gian Francesco. The first stone was laid down on 10 July 1759 by monsignor Giovanni Maria Azzopardi Castelletti. It was completed within three years, being was consecrated in 1762. The chapel was presumably built to serve the religious needs of farmers who lived in the area, and it is sometimes known as Tas-Subriƒãint. At some point, a plaque stating non gode l'immunita ecclesias was installed near the doorway to indicate that the chapel did not enjoy ecclesiastical immunity. The chapel was damaged during World War II, and it was repaired in November 1945. For some time, Society of Christian Doctrine members from ≈ªabbar used the chapel for retreats. Today, the chapel is located within the limits of Marsaskala, but it forms part of the parish of ≈ªabbar. The chapel is open on Friday evenings for rosary or adoration, and mass is held there once every month. The chapel is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. It is erroneously listed twice with inventory numbers 1741 and 2102, under the localities of Marsaskala and ≈ªabbar respectively. Architecture Wooden statue of St. Nicholas, now in the ≈ªabbar Sanctuary Museum The chapel is built in the Baroque style out of local limestone. The chapel is a rectangular building, and it has a small cylindrical dome with a lantern. The fa√ßade contains the main portal, which is flanked by two sets of flat pilasters set on plinths. The doorway is set in the central bay, and it is decorated by mouldings and topped with a pediment. A window which illuminates the chapel is found above the door. A wide entablature topped by a cornice runs along the entire fa√ßade, and another triangular pediment tops the central bay. This is decorated with the coat of arms of Bishop Bartolom√© Rull, surmounted by the arms of Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca. A plaque with a Latin inscription commemorating the chapel's completion is found above the main doorway, while a longer inscription describing the course of construction is located inside the chapel. Artworks The chapel's altarpiece depicts Saint Nicholas wearing a bishop's clothing, and it is attributed to Mattia Preti. The original painting is now in the ≈ªabbar Sanctuary Museum, and a copy by Michael Mifsud is located inside the chapel. A small wooden statue of Saint Nicholas from the old chapel was moved to the ≈ªabbar Sanctuary in the 17th century, but was placed in the new chapel once this was completed. This was eventually moved to the ≈ªabbar Sanctuary Museum, and another statue of the saint is found in the chapel.

The approval of the fuel tax was for a projected $52.4 billion, or $5.24 billion per year, to be raised over the next 10 years to fund the state's infrastructure. It passed 27‚Äì11 in the State Senate and 54‚Äì26 in the State Assembly.

Voting  The California State Senate had passed the bill 27‚Äì11 and 54‚Äì26 in the State Assembly, the minimum amount required to pass the legislation in both houses. Senator Steve Glazer (D‚ÄìOrinda) stated that he would not back the bill \\"for good reasons\\" citing that he did not have enough support at home to vote in favor of the bill. Only one Democratic Assemblyman, Rudy Salas (D‚ÄìBakersfield) would not back the bill.  Coverage  The $52 billion does not go to one agency, but is divided up to go to different projects. The revenues estimated to be available for allocation under the act to local agencies are estimated to be the following amounts, over the 10 years after the bill was passed: * $15 billion to local street and road maintenance. * $7.5 billion for transit operations and capital. * $2 billion for the local partnership program. * $1 billion for the Active Transportation Program. * $825 million for the regional share of the State Transportation Improvement Program. * $250 million for local planning grants. The revenues estimated to be available for allocation under the act to the state are estimated to be the following amounts, over the 10 years after the bill was passed: Breakdown of funding allocations between state and local. * $15 billion for state highway maintenance and rehabilitation. * $4 billion for highway bridge and culvert maintenance and rehabilitation. * $3 billion for high priority freight corridors. * $2.5 billion for congested corridor relief. * $800 million for parks programs, off-highway vehicle programs, boating programs, and agricultural programs. * $275 million for the inter- regional share of the State Transportation Improvement Program. * $250 million for freeway service patrols. * $70 million for transportation research at the University of California and the California State University. The revenues are divided up between the state and local governments, with the vast majority ($30 billion) going towards road maintenance. Support The American Road and Transportation Builders Association argued that the Road Repair and Accountability Act would provide California with $18.3 billion of economic benefits per year, including $3.8 billion per year in user benefits as a result of decreased congestion and improved infrastructure, and $11.2 billion in increased economic activity that would be enabled by better transportation infrastructure. Through the improved roads and transportation options, they said SB1 would save the average California household $300 per year.  Criticisms  Some California residents complained about how the tax affects them, and Republicans said that California has one of the highest transportation tax rates in the country. A poll published in June 2017 showed that 58% of California residents oppose the increase in fuel taxes, 39% of all respondents stating they \\"strongly oppose\\" the increase. California SB1 Car Registration Fee annual increase. SB1 also imposed a vehicle registration fee increase. The annual fee increase is based on the value of the vehicle, ranging from $25 to $175. There are also voter concerns of transportation funds being protected to be used just for transportation, as by previous mandates of Proposition 42 (2003) and Proposition 1a (2006). Even with past protections, 1.8 billion of fuel tax funds in 2010 were moved to the General Fund, known as the gas tax swap. The June 2018 ballot included Proposition 69, an amendment that ensures revenues are used for transportation-related purposes. California spends 2.5 times as much per mile of state-controlled highway as the national average. As such, one criticism centers not on the amount of revenue, but on the way the revenue is spent.  Proposition 69  The SB1 taxes were exempt from expenditures appropriations limits. Proposition 69 was a state constitution amendment that ensures that revenues from SB1 can only be used for transportation-related purposes. Voters approved this proposition in June 2018, locking the tax revenue to transportation only. The SB1 car registration fee increase and all older existing fuel tax revenues before SB1 are still appropriated to the General Fund.  Proposition 6  left A ballot initiative ‚ÄúRepeal the Gas Car Tax‚Äù signature drive was led by Carl DeMaio. Volunteers gathered more than 940,000 signatures statewide, which exceeded the minimum requirement of 584,000 signatures for the measure to be on the November 2018 voter ballot. The Proposition 6 ballot initiative, if it had been passed by voters, would have repealed the fuel tax increase and the vehicle registration fee increase, and would have mandated any future fuel tax increase be approved only by popular vote. The measure failed with about 55% of voters opposed.  References  External links * SB-1 Transportation funding.

He was a successful solo piper, as well as a pipe major and composer. Life Willie Ross on the left, with G. S. McLennan in the middle and John Macdonald of Inverness on the right He was born on 9 February 1883 at 105 St. Leonard Street, Edinburgh, to John and Elizabeth ( Stewart) McLennan, the eighth of their nine children (one of whom died in infancy). Many of his ancestors on both sides of the family were prominent pipers. George's father John was the first to use the spelling McLennan; his predecessors had used the spelling MacLennan. George's mother Elizabeth died when he was young, and his father remarried a widow with two children and subsequently had three more children with her. Among his half-siblings was Gold Medal winner Donald Ross McLennan. George suffered from polio as a child, and could not walk until the age of four and a half. McLennan began receiving piping tuition from his father at the age of four, and later received tuition from his uncle Pipe Major John Stewart, and in Highland dancing from his cousin William McLennan. He made rapid progression, winning the Amateur National Championship at the age of nine, and was invited by Queen Victoria to play for her at Balmoral Castle. His father enlisted him in the Gordon Highlanders in October 1899 in order to prevent him from joining the Merchant Navy, and he became Pipe major of the 1st Battalion in 1905, one of the youngest ever in the British Army. McLennan was successful in solo competitions, and won the Gold Medal at the Argyllshire Gathering in Oban in 1904 and at the Northern Meeting in Inverness in 1905, and the Clasp at Inverness for former winners of the Gold Medal in 1909, 1920 and 1921. McLennan had a close friendship and competitive rivalry with Willie Ross, and he travelled to competitions and shared prize money with William Lawrie. He married Nona Lucking on 3 April 1912, and together they had two sons, George (1914‚Äì1996) and John (1916‚Äì1940), who both became pipers with the Gordon Highlanders. McLennan was posted at the depot in Aberdeen until 1918, when he was sent to the Western Front to succeed Pipe Major Tom Henderson who had been killed. In May 1918 he collapsed and required fluid to be drained from his lungs in a field hospital. When the war ended he was posted back to Aberdeen, and after he was discharged in 1922 he started working in Aberdeen as a bagpipe maker, at a shop at 2 Bath Street. At the time there were several other prominent musicians in the city, including fiddler James Scott Skinner. He died on 31 May 1929 of lung cancer after a long period of ill health connected to the makeshift operation. 20,000 people lined the route of the procession to Aberdeen station at his funeral on the 4th of June, before he was interred at Newington Cemetery in Edinburgh. Musical influence G. S. McLennan was a composer of both pibroch and ce√≤l beag (light music). He inherited views on pibroch playing from his father, who had written two books on the subject. John was critical of the style espoused by the newly formed Piobaireachd Society, and believed it to be too slow and rhythmically loose. G. S. McLennan would step in time to pibroch as he played, which is not normally done. He also significantly developed the style of light music with his compositions, making it more varied and technically demanding. His technical ability was extraordinary, and it is said that his fingers could be heard distinctly on the chanter when he played. Donald MacLeod described McLennan as \\"the most complete piper of this century\\". Many of his compositions are widely played today, and include * The Jig of Slurs * Mrs MacPherson of Inveran * The Little Cascade * Inveran * Dancing Feet * Biddy from Sligo * Alick C.

His main instrument was the guitar. His name was misspelled \\"Conny Veidt\\" in Gila's first album. Biography and career Little is known about Conny's life. In 1969 he founded Gila and, in 1971, recorded their first album, Free Electric Sound. In 1972 he joined Popol Vuh for a short period. According to Conny, as for myself, in 1972, aged 21, I decided to move to Munich, because Popol Vuh‚Äôs Florian Fricke had invited me to collaborate on his new LP Hosianna Mantra. I had accepted the offer, yet I didn't want to leave Gila because Popol Vuh was a pure studio project. Anyway for me, it was not until I took that step that my life as a professional musician began. In 1973 he released the second Gila album, Bury my heart at wounded knee, with a new line-up featuring Daniel Fichelscher, Florian Fricke, Conny and his girlfriend Sabine Merbach. The second Gila iteration didn't have much of a lifespan either. Seemingly uninterested in touring, the band's focus splinted with Fichelscher and Fricke returning to Popol Vuh. For his part, Veit began working with Amon Duul II, before briefly hooking up with Guru Guru. He later turned his attention to painting. Suffering from alcoholism, Merbach died from liver failure. Daniel Fichelscher once stated that Conny was my best friend, I will never forget how we played 8 days a week. After the intensive work for Hosianna Mantra Conny Veit toured in France with Amon D√º√ºl II during the winter of 1973-1974 with Chis Karrer, John Weinzierl, Peter Leopold, Nick Woodland, Andy Vix and Jutta Weinhold. During 1985 and 1986 he was member of a band called Coney Island, under the name of Coney Fight. In August 1999, Conny wrote to Wolf-Reinhart Kotzsch (owner of Second Battle recording company), stating that he had found suitable musicians for a new line-up of Gila, with whom he wanted to overdub some tracks recorded in their rehearsal studio in the eighties, which had not been released at that point in time. In Conny's view, the tapes were very interesting, because they offered a view about the possible development of the group at that period, if that should ever have materialized. In Hamburg I found some motivated musicians with close contacts to Berlin to bring Gila back to life again. There are some valuable tapes, although the material is not known to the public. Unfortunately, Second Battle couldn't get the project off the ground, because the label had to endure a lot of problems, like the insolvencies of business partners and the bootleg pirates, who have flooded the market of Progressive Rock for years and also destroyed more than one fellow company. Walter Nowicki released Gila's second album officially, so Conny had the chance to beat the bloodsucking \\"rip-off-managers\\" for once, just before his sad and untimely death. In 2008, Second Battle released the album Free Electric Rock Sessions, live in Koln 1972.

It was to be located close to the original centre of Morden village in the London Borough of Merton, in south-west London. Plan Road bridge carrying Central Road over the railway. The site proposed for the station was on the other side of the bridge. The station was to have been built on the W&SR;'s planned surface railway line in Surrey (now south-west London) from Wimbledon to Sutton. The station was to be on the south side of Central Road. The construction of the railway was approved in 1910. In 1911 the UERL agreed to provide funding for the line's construction and to operate its train services by extending the UERL's District Railway (DR) from Wimbledon station. Delays in the purchase of land along the railway's route and the outbreak of war prevented the works from commencing and the permission was extended several times with a final extension granted in 1922. Following the war, the UERL presented new proposals to construct an extension of the City and South London Railway (C&SLR;, now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden in tunnel where it would come to the surface and join the W&SR; route. Both DR and C&SLR; trains would run to Sutton. The first C&SLR; station to the north was to be named \\"North Morden\\" and the W&SR; station near the village was to be named \\"South Morden\\". The plan to extend the C&SLR; was opposed by the Southern Railway (SR), the operator of the mainline services through Wimbledon and Sutton. A settlement between the companies agreed that the extension of the C&SLR; would end at North Morden (which opened as plain \\"Morden\\") and the W&SR; would be taken over and its route would be constructed by the SR. When the Wimbledon to Sutton line was constructed by the SR in the late 1920s, Morden village station was omitted and replaced with Morden South to the north adjacent to London Road and St Helier to the south on Green Lane.

The viaduct is in length and carries the South Western Main Line into Waterloo station. Initially constructed in 1848, the viaduct begins in eastern Battersea in Nine Elms and with an intermediate station at Vauxhall incorporated within the viaduct, the viaduct terminates at Waterloo. The viaduct comprises six iron girder bridges, with a combined weight of , and over 290 arches (excluding those beneath the Waterloo Bridge terminus). The brick sections of the viaduct are composed of some 80,000,000 bricks. The viaduct is managed by Network Rail, who in turn lease many of the arches for commercial, retail and industrial use. History In the mid-19th century, the original London and South Western Railway terminus was located at Nine Elms on the south-western edge of what was then the urban limit of developed London. To facilitate easier entrance for goods and passengers into central London, the railway sought a ‚ÄúMetropolitan Extension‚Äù from Nine Elms to Waterloo Bridge. A four-track extension was authorised by an Act of Parliament on 31 July 1845 with a supplementary Act of 1847 providing an additional two tracks; the capital authorised was estimated at ¬£800,000. The work was carried out under the direction of the engineer Joseph Locke. Running through the ancient parishes of Battersea and Lambeth the construction was reported to have displaced about 700 houses. It dissected the areas of Vauxhall and Lambeth, creating an artificial divide. Passage underneath the viaduct is obtained through one of the many tunnels constructed underneath the viaduct for street level access. It was stated that one glassworks, one engineering works, the Royal Swimming Baths and a church (All Saints Church) were all demolished for the construction of the viaduct. However, the viaduct was built to avoid some major landmarks at the time, including the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens and Lambeth Palace and for this reason does not follow a straight route to Waterloo. The opening of the viaduct and line was planned for 30 June 1848, but the Board of Trade Inspector did not approve some of the large-span bridges at the eastern end, however his superior was satisfied by later load tests, and the line opened on 11 July 1848. Further widening of the viaduct took place between 1877 and 1868 and again from 1898, when an eight- track railway all the way through from Waterloo to Clapham Junction was completed (taking until 1910 to be fully completed). An aerial view showing the viaduct and the South Western Main Line to its terminus at Waterloo Stations The viaduct still has two railway stations, the first is an intermediate station at Vauxhall incorporated within the viaduct and the second is the terminus at London Waterloo.

The process contain the following four steps.  Create Template  The \\"template\\" can be created by either photolithography or e-beam lithography to define binding sites for various building blocks. The binding sites should reflect the foot print of the building blocks or clusters to be bound.  Surface Treatment  After film development, the created pattern is treated with charged polymers in order to ‚Äústick‚Äù the particles. Take poly-lysine as an example, the poly-lysine will cover the negatively charged glass surface and turn the charge to be positive; it thus can non-specifically bind negatively charged metallic nanoparticles.  Particle Assembly  To do particle assembly, treated pattern is submerged in a small amount of aqueous solution of particles. A few approaches can be used to facilitate the binding efficiency. One of them is to use capillary force at the edge of the aqueous droplet to ‚Äúpush‚Äù the particles into the binding sites. If assembling multiple types of particles, the particles should be assembled in the order of decreasing sizes. For example, if assembling both 60 nm gold nanoparticles as well as 40 nm silver nanoparticles, 60 nm gold nanoparticles should be applied first because it is too big to enter binding sites tailored for 40 nm particles. Rationally design the binding sequence as well as the binding site sizes can minimize the binding errors from occurring.  Remove Template  After binding of all building blocks, the template can be removed by either dissolving in an organic solvent, or stripped off by a scotch tape.

The STANAG, and its supporting NATO publications, provides guidance on managing the configuration of products and services. It is unique in its full life cycle perspective, requiring a Life Cycle CM Plan, and in its approach to contracting for CM, using an ISO standard as the base, and building-up additional requirements (as opposed to the classical tailoring-down). History STANAG 4427 is NATO‚Äôs agreement on how to do configuration management on defense systems. Edition 1 was originally promulgated in 1997 and updated with Edition 2 in 2007. The first iteration of the Standardization Agreement was entitled Introduction of Allied Configuration Management Publications (ACMPs), and it called on ratifying nations to use seven NATO publications (ACMP 1-7) as the agreed upon contractual clauses for configuration management. In 2010, NATO undertook to review and revise the STANAGs and ACMPs with two major assignments: make the NATO guidance useful and extend the guidance through the full project life cycle. This work resulted in the promulgation of STANAG 4427 Edition 3, Configuration Management in System Life Cycle Management, in 2014. As of 2017, it has been ratified by 19 nations. Overview With Edition 3, NATO published three new ACMPs: ACMP-2000, Policy on Configuration Management; ACMP-2009, Guidance on Configuration Management; and ACMP-2100, Configuration Management Contractual Requirements. This trio of publications uses a civil standard as the platform (ISO 10007), requires the acquirer to prepare and maintain a Life Cycle CM Plan for the system, to use a combination of governance and insight that is required to achieve the specific system objectives, and to build-up contractual requirements based on defined needs, rather than boilerplates.

Clowes is notable for having been prohibited from playing on that 1888 tour due to the Rugby Football Union deeming him a professional, and for the subsequent ramifications of his case contributing to the creation of the Northern Rugby Football Union in 1895. Early life and career John William Preston Clowes was born on 31 July 1866 in Philadelphia, as a British subject, the eldest son of Stephen Clowes and Mary (nee Preston). His parents were both from Leicestershire ‚Äì Shearsby and Kilby respectively ‚Äì and, after marrying in 1865, left for the United States of America, arriving in New York on 6 November 1865.Year: 1865; Arrival: New York City; Microfilm Serial: M237, 1820‚Äì1897; Microfilm Roll: Roll 258; Line: 21; List Number: 1081 John was born the next year in Philadelphia.

He became a factory worked and a mechanic.  Domestic career  Jack Clowes began playing rugby football at the age of 16, joining the Halifax Free Wanderers, at the time a very good junior team. After playing two seasons with the Wanderers he joined the Halifax Club in 1884. He was a member of the team that won the Yorkshire Challenge Cup in 1886 and hardly missed a game for the club for the next two years. In 1888 he was selected to play for Yorkshire County, making his d√©but against Somerset. Playing as a forward, he was very fast, an expert dribbler and a good tackler. He was considered to be one of the best rising players in the North of England in 1888, and was the leading scorer for Halifax in that season, leading to his selection for the British team's tour to New Zealand and Australia. British Isles The 1888 tour was organised by two cricket professionals, Arthur Shrewsbury and Alfred Shaw, who had little appreciation of the seriousness with which the RFU took the amateur ideal.The forgotten story of the 1888 Lions tour, The Guardian, Alex McClintock, Thursday 27 June 2013 00.27 BST They had appointed an agent to recruit the players and pay them a clothing allowance of ¬£15 each. Lions' tragic history uncovered Peter Jackson, Daily Mail Wednesday 30 May 2001 23:00 BST Before the tour began, Halifax played Dewsbury in the second round of the Yorkshire Cup. Two of Dewsbury's players, William Stadden and Angus Stuart, the latter who had also been selected for the British Isles team, were withdrawn from playing in the cup match by the president of Dewsbury, Mark Newsome after he had learned from Stuart of the ¬£15 allowance. Dewsbury lost the match and Newsome subsequently appealed the result on the grounds that Halifax had fielded a professional in the person of Clowes.Tony Collins, Rugby's Great Split: Class, Culture and the Origins of Rugby League Football, p57, Routledge, 2013, , 9781134221370 Clowes subsequently appeared before the Yorkshire Committee and admitted everything, and offered to pay back the ¬£15. However, the RFU later judged him to be a professional but the news did not reach him until he was aboard the Kaikoura having set sail with the touring party. The rules of the day were such that, if one professional was deemed to have played in a match then the whole side was deemed professional. As such, Clowes was forbidden from playing any games on the tour. Shrewsbury even commented to Shaw of Clowes \\"he is a dead head and of no use to us at all\\". On the teams return in November 1888 there was still much confusion as to the status of the tourists. However, the RFU simply lifted the ban on Clowes and called on the other tourists to sign declarations that they had only received no money other than expenses whilst on tour.

The inconsistent manner in which the RFU had dealt with the matter instigated a reaction in Yorkshire whereby the Yorkshire Rugby Union became more determined and zealous in their pursuit of stamping out professionalism.

It is akin to surgical emphysema seen in humans, although somewhat more profound in hedgehogs due to their tissue structure. The British Hedgehog Preservation Society describes the symptoms as: \\"Hedgehog has blown up appearance, subcutaneous emphysema\\". Reported incidents In 2017 the BBC reported a case in which a male hedgehog was \\"almost twice its natural size, literally blown up like a beach ball with incredibly taut skin\\". The head vet at Stapeley's Wildlife Hospital, Bev Panto, said, \\"In my career I have seen three or four of these cases and they are very strange every time and quite shocking ... When you first see them they appear to be very big hedgehogs but when you pick them up they feel so light because they are mostly air\\". She added that the condition was unique to hedgehogs because they have significant space under their skin as a result of their ability to curl up. A similar case had been reported in 2013. Causes and treatment The British Hedgehog Preservation Society advises that: \\"There is no single cause for this condition. The air can be removed by incising or aspirating through the skin over the back. Antibiotic cover should be given. This may be associated with lung/chest wall damage or a small external wound acting like a valve or a clostridium type infection\\". Incisions in the affected parts of the hedgehog will allow the trapped air to escape, but these must remain open until after the animal's lungs have healed to prevent recurrence of the syndrome. In July 2017 Live Science reported Romain Pizzi, the specialist wildlife veterinary surgeon at the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Scottish SPCA), saying that, \\"Hedgehogs have a little windpipe that runs from their mouth and nose to their lungs, and at the top of this windpipe is the glottis, which opens and closes as hedgehogs breathe. ... If a hedgehog is struck when that glottis is open, air simply flows out of the lungs and out of the body. But if the glottis is closed when the animal is struck, that air has nowhere to go, and the lung tissue can rupture. It's like a balloon popping. ... This trauma can also cause damage to the muscles in between a hedgehog's ribs\\". Live Science added that \\"the ruptures in the lungs and rib muscles [according to Pizzi] 'act like a one-way valve,' so air can flow out of the lungs and into the body cavity‚Äîbut not back in. So, with each breath the hedgehog takes, a bit of air leaks out, causing the hedgehog to inflate itself. ... Pizzi noted that the tissue under a hedgehog's skin isn't designed to be filled with air, so it's not one big open compartment. Instead, there is a lot of connective tissue under the skin, sectioning areas off into little compartments of air. Though it's called balloon syndrome, in most cases the hedgehogs 'puff up more like Bubble Wrap,' he said\\".

Background  Tsai was born in Taiwan, and immigrated to Canada with his family at the age of 15. His parents fell on difficult times, and Tsai had to work multiple jobs to assist his family financially. After stumbling on a magician's street performance, he was inspired to become a magician himself. He has been practicing magic for 13 years.  Career  Tsai has been producing magic videos and products under the company name SansMinds since 2010, and has created multiple tricks, props, and devices for magicians and performers. Although he began his career developing tricks like Holely and Trace, Tsai eventually moved on to engineering stage props and devices such as VAPR, Absolute Zero, and VAPR Watch. Tsai also operates under the nickname The Visualist, as he believes he cannot be fully categorized alongside other magicians or illusionists due to his personal magic style. In May 2017, Tsai successfully auditioned for America's Got Talent Season 12 with an act he had developed himself. He was promoted to the next round by all four judges. Since the initial airing of the premiere, his performance has received over 40 million views. Although normally sporting a flashier fashion style, his toned down appearance on AGT was purposefully done to suit the audience, playing his real self as opposed to a stage persona, which is common in the magic industry. Due to logistical errors in customs, his original intended act could not be performed. Tsai developed the aired AGT act within a week, and was able to perform on stage with no issues. Tsai was featured on the cover of Vanish International Magic Magazine Edition 35, which was released in June 2017. Tsai performed with Jay Chou during 2018's CCTV Spring Festival.  Personal life  Tsai lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with his dog Mochi and his cat Fluffington. He has a strong relationship with both his grandmothers, and is cited saying they are his main source of inspiration. During a job in Brazil, Tsai contracted a lung infection with a slim chance of survival. After a remarkable recovery, Tsai dedicated his life to pushing the boundaries of magic.

It is the second of two similarly titled paintings based on nude photographs of his close friend Henrietta Moraes, who is shown in a reclining position on a bed, themselves part of a wider series of collapsed figures on beds that began with the 1963 triptych Lying Figure.Dawson, 97 This later version is widely considered the more successful of the two panels.\\"Version No. 2 of Lying Figure with Hypodermic Syringe\\". Sothebys, 14 November 2014. Retrieved 12 June 2017 Moraes and Bacon were drinking friends, she was a favourite model and he depicted her over a dozen times in a variety of forms, including single panel portraits, triptych portraits, and as part of larger scale figurations such as this panel. They knew each other from Soho's Colony Club, where they often met with John Deakin, another close friend, and a photographer whom Bacon commission to take the photographs on which the painting is based.Russell, 100 Moraes was a noted beauty and an artists model in 1960s London, and a muse to Bacon, Lucian Freud and later to Maggi Hambling. Bacon was decidedly gay and did not often paint or show much interest in female nudes, although Deakin's original photographs are quite erotic, verging on voyeuristic and seedy.Farr, 144 A few of Bacon's other incorporated influences, including Henry Fuseli's 1871 The Nightmare, which emphasis female sexuality and appeal, especially according to Sothebys, in the long hair and \\"thrown back arm, so eloquent of physical abandon\\". Bacon's painting contains traces of these influences, but is more focused on inner turmoil and projection of his bleak, nihilistic, outlook. This is apparent in the contorted and unflattering manner in which he depicts his model, and most especially in the manner she is seemingly pinned to the bed by the hypodermic syringe.Sylvester, 31 Bacon was avowedly against melodrama and loaded meanings in his paintings, and of for years seemed defensive in including such a direct utensil as syringe. He instead saw the device as akin to the nails in a depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus, a particular obsession of his, and said \\"I've used the figures lying on beds with a hypodermic syringe as a form of nailing the image more strongly to reality or appearance. I don't put the syringe because of the drug that's being injected but because it's less stupid than putting a nail through the arm, which would be even more melodramatic.\\"Dawson, 98 A bitter irony is that Moraes fell victim to heroin addiction from the 1970s. The painting is similar in tone, form and theme to his 1967 Triptych Inspired by T.S. Eliot's Poem \\"Sweeney Agonistes\\", in which the central figure, also reclining, is reduced to a slab of flesh. van Alphen, 68 References Sources * Dawson, Barbara; Sylvester, David.

During the Pliocene, the presence of a large lake provided habitat for fish. As the climate started to dry during the Pleistocene, vegetation similar to the present-day flora developed, although its geographical distribution was markedly different. Further drying occurred during the North American glaciation period that followed, resulting in the general aridity of the region today. Snake River Plain in Idaho Pliocene The Snake River Plain of 4 million years ago in the Pliocene differed greatly from today. With respect to climate, there was much lower temperature seasonality and the humidity was much higher. Much of the western Plain was submerged under the waters of Lake Idaho, which encompassed an area as large as Lake Ontario and covered the low elevation areas between Twin Falls and Hells Canyon. Summers were milder and winters were warmer with an estimated annual temperature gradient of 10¬∞‚Äì25 ¬∞C. These conditions allowed for fish assemblages that are not observable in this area today. =Evidence= Researchers Smith & Patterson analyzed sediment samples from the western Plain's Chalk Hills Formation and found the fossilized inner-ear bones (otoliths) of sunfish to contain hints about the region's climate past. Two characteristics of the fossil offer a proxy for temperature and moisture conditions: 1) width of the bone's growth bands (length of growing season) and the Œ¥18O isotope composition (moisture source for lake waters). The growth band widths of the bone indicated that the growing season, or annual period of relatively warm weather, was much longer than it is today. A very low Œ¥18O value was also found within the bone indicating that the predominant source of moisture for the ancient lake was high-elevation snow run-off which experienced low evaporation rates after entering the lake's waters. This moisture source is not unlike the moisture source of today but due to more equitable seasonal temperatures and thus less evaporation in the summers, lakes reached greater depth over time than they would today. This may be a contributing factor to the ‚Äòdisharmonious assemblage‚Äô that Smith & Patterson found among the fossil record for the Pliocene epoch. Sunfish and catfish were occupying the same waters, albeit different depths, as sculpins and trout at the same time. Sculpins reportedly went extinct at approximately 2 million years ago in this lake which may provide a signal for heightened summer temperatures and thus an increase in deep, cold-water temperatures in the ancient lake. The annual climate regime for much of the Pliocene era (5.3 Mya‚Äì2.58 Mya) on the Snake River Plain was analogous to the contemporary, upper Sacramento Valley of central California with an annual temperature range of approximately 0¬∞-21 ¬∞C. Pleistocene Following the Pliocene was the Pleistocene which marked the beginning of a drying trend that has lasted the last two million years. The vegetation of the early Pleistocene on the Plain was similar to modern-day flora but with notably different geographic distributions. Conifer woodland and sagebrush occupied much of the western Snake River Plain but the clear difference was the relative abundance of conifers at low elevations competing for the moist soils surrounding the several lakes of the area. =Evidence= Sediment samples taken from a site near Bruneau, Idaho retrieved pollen records for the purpose of analyzing the shift in vegetation proportions at the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition. The steady decline of pine and spruce species was found to be evident as early as the beginning of the Pliocene (represented by the region's Glenns Ferry formation). As pollen records marched forward through time, it also become evident that sagebrush (Artemisia) and chenopods (regional species belonging to the families Chenopodiaceae and Amaranthaceae) were increasing in frequency near the Bruneau site. Oak and hemlock species were also found in Pliocene-era pollen records, and their absence in Pleistocene records has led climatologists to hypothesize that their absence is indicative of a moisture decrease from the Pliocene to the Pleistocene. A cooling, drying trend has been interpreted from the Bruneau, Idaho sediment core. As this trend unfolded, woodland-arid steppe oscillations began to occur across thousands of years with the sagebrush steppe ultimately succeeding. =A glaciation signal?= The Pleistocene-era Bruneau formation represents the time period from approximately 1.67 Mya to 1.5 Mya which matches up with the period believed to mark the onset of glaciation of the North American Intermountain West. With glaciation comes drier and colder atmospheric circulation which may help to explain the downfall of the conifer woodland at low elevations of the Snake River Plain. Last glacial maximum During the peak of the last glaciation, wind direction and path was greatly altered due to the presence of the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets. The position of these glaciers diverted the Pacific westerlies, which are and have been the dominant source of atmospheric moisture for the Plain, and introduced dry easterlies into the region. Sea-surface temperatures are estimated to have been roughly 6¬∞-7 ¬∞C cooler and annual average atmospheric temperatures in the region 4¬∞-5 ¬∞C cooler than at present. =Evidence= A study published in 2008 reported the climate estimations described above with reference to several Œ¥18O and Œ¥2H isotope measurements from four groundwater systems in the Boise, Idaho area. The four systems were selected based on the time period that they represent. Together, these groundwater systems provide a proxy for western Plain humidity and temperature over the past 30 thousand years. Holocene Broadly, the Holocene epoch has been an era of aridity on the Snake River Plain. The drying trend observed in the Pleistocene pollen records at the Bruneau site continued throughout the last major glaciation of North America and into the current interglacial period. Today's climate and vegetation qualities on the Plain are largely similar to the region's conditions over the last 11,000 years. Natural vegetation on the Snake River Plain near Shoshone Falls in Idaho Pollen records representing the majority of the Holocene (10 Kya ‚Äì 3.5 Kya) show a peak in shadscale steppe conditions between 10 and 8 Kya. Shadscale steppe is dominated by low-growing Chenopod shrubs and flourish in conditions slightly drier than sagebrush steppe. These shrubs were prevalent at their highest elevations ever recorded for the Plain indicating a period of relatively low moisture. However, another study consisting of several sediment samples on the eastern Plain within the boundaries of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) indicate a time of peak aridity correlating to the time of the Mt. Mazama eruption approximately 7,700 years ago. This peak was also inferred by a high prevalence in Chenopod pollen found at the INEL sites for that time period. Severe drought episodes are estimated to have occurred throughout the Holocene epoch. Sediment cores from Wyoming's Yellowstone Lake and carbon-dated bison remains found in lava tubes on the eastern Plain have helped to illustrate this dry history. Yellowstone Lake serves as the main water source for the Columbia-Snake drainage system and thus provides context for the Plain's hydrologic history. A cumulative decrease of approximately 60 cm has been inferred for the time period between 9.13 Kya and 8.78 Kya according to sediment analysis. The same study yielded estimates of more than 50 \\"drought years\\" per century from 1.38 Kya to 1.29 Kya. Bison remains were stored by indigenous human groups in lava tubes as an act of preservation. These tubes maintain temperatures below 0 ¬∞C throughout the year and thus acted as freezers for bison meat in times of bison scarcity likely due to hotter, drier-than-normal periods of time during the Holocene epoch. Relative to all radiocarbon-dated remains excavated between 1987 and 2004, extremely high amounts of remains were found to be stored at a) 900 years ago, b) 2-3 Kya, c) 4-5 Kya and at d) 7-8 Kya implying that these may have been some of the driest and hottest events on the Snake River Plain in recent history.

These are: military tribune of Legio XXI Rapax, sevir equitum Romanorum turmae VI, and legatus legionis of an unknown legion while Trajan was emperor; the traditional Republican magistracy of praetor does not appear in the surviving text. The XXI Rapax was involved in the rebellion of Lucius Antonius Saturninus in 89, then was destroyed in 92, while fighting on the Lower Danube against the Sarmatians;Julian Bennett, Trajan: Optimus Princeps: a Life and Times (London: Routledge, 1997), p. 33 Cornelius Priscus had to have held his commission either before the revolt, or less likely about the time of its defeat, but definitely before 92. On the other hand, he could not have commanded the full legion before Trajan assumed the purple, which was in 98. Either Cornelius Priscus had a lengthy wait between his praetorship (which he would have reached no earlier than 93); or he was rehabilitated after the loss of the legion to which he was attached in 92, in order for Trajan to give him command of a legion. One office after his consulship is known for him, proconsular governor of Asia in 120/121.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 13 (1983), p. 154 Cornelius Priscus was the recipient of one of Pliny's letters, and the subject of a second. The letter he received concerned the death of the poet Martial (III.21). In the other letter, Pliny mentions Priscus' presence at the lawsuit between a delegation from the province of Bithynia and Pontus and Varenus Rufus, who had been their proconsular governor in 105/106 (V.20.7). Priscus made the motion, that was approved by the Senate, to investigate both the accusations of the Bithynians, and of the counter- claims Rufus had made.

History The community's name is an amalgamation of Mellon and Croft, surnames of businessmen in the local mining industry. =2018 shooting= In 2018, a mass shooting at a car wash left five people dead, including the perpetrator, and a sixth person with minor injuries. The incident occurred on January 28, 2018, at Ed's Car Wash, just before 3:00 a.m., in the Melcroft community of Saltlick Township, south-east of Pittsburgh. The six people involved had arranged to meet at the local car wash for a fistfight between one of the victims and the eventual shooter. Chelsie Cline, 25, her half-brother, Seth Cline, 21, her boyfriend at the time, William Porterfield, 27, a friend, Cortney Snyder, 23, and another unidentified woman, met with 28-year-old Timothy O‚ÄôBrien Smith at the car wash. Smith had previously been in a relationship with Cline and reportedly had an ongoing feud with Porterfield who was her current boyfriend at the time. Surveillance video had shown Smith grabbing Porterfield from behind earlier that morning at the Tall Cedars bar. Smith arrived at the car wash wearing a body armor carrier without the ballistic panels, and was armed with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, a .308-caliber rifle, and a 9mm handgun. Smith opened fire on the victims with both his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and 9mm handgun. First, he killed both Cline and Porterfield, by gunning them down in the car wash's parking lot after they stepped out of their sedan. He then killed Snyder and Cline's half-brother as they sat in their pickup truck. The unidentified woman with them sat in the back of the vehicle survived after being taken to hospital. In total, three vehicles were towed from the location, two were pickup trucks and the other was a sedan. After killing four people, Smith turned the gun on himself and shot himself in the head. He initially survived, but later died at a hospital just before 10:00 p.m. At the time, it was the deadliest shooting in the U.S. in the year 2018, until it was surpassed by the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting just seventeen days later.

The intimate venue seats 170 guests. It was founded in 1972 by Phil Ciganer. After a period of decline, it has enjoyed increased popularity in recent years.Goldsmith, Kate. \\"The Towne Crier Caf√© Turns 30, Standing Firm amid the Shifting Sands of Popular Music.\\" Dutchess Magazine May 2002: 46‚Äì52. Web. History Founder Phil Ciganer discovered the first location for the club while delivering a piece of art to a friend in the Town of Beekman, Dutchess County, NY. ‚ÄúIt was an interesting, charming little setting,‚Äù he recalls. Part of the building dated back to the 1600s and had once been a stagecoach stop and post office. By 1972 the new enterprise, appropriately called the Towne Crier Cafe, was up and running. Ciganer liked the idea of being a ‚Äúproving ground‚Äù for local talent but also brought in well-known musicians such as Leon Redbone, Odeta, Dave Van Ronk, Richie Havens, Dr. John, Taj Mahal and John Hammond. Issues with the building and insufficient parking prompted Ciganer to seek a new location. After 16 years in Beekman, The Towne Crier moving to Pawling in 1988. Though not as historically interesting as its predecessor, the Pawling location accommodated more people and offered expanded dining facilities. Decorated inside and out with a Southwestern motif, the club sported a stage set into a corner of an open, tiered room furnished with tables and chairs. The enclosed bar adjacent to this area was decorated with photos of the many artists who performed at the Towne Crier. Situated on the Route 22 corridor along a major commuter route, the Pawling venue was frequented by many New York City-based musicians such as Jimmy Vivino, Sid McGinnis, Paul Shaeffer. Eventually, Ciganer's ambitions outgrew the Pawling location and the club relocated to Beacon, New York, which has enjoyed a cultural \\"rebirth\\" in recent years. Ciganer cites this cultural renaissance as the main factor in choosing to relocate the Towne Crier Cafe to Beacon. Notable performers The diverse roster of artists who have graced its stage include Pete Seeger, John Renbourn, Richie Havens, Suzanne Vega, Jack Hardy, Richard Thompson, Jorma Kaukonen, Altan, the Flying Karamazov Brothers, Leo Kottke, Adrian Legg, Billy McLaughlin, Preston Reed, Clifton Chenier, Odetta, Dr. John, Southside Johnny, Ani DiFranco, Black Violin, Taj Mahal, John Hammond, Bela Fleck, Gandalf Murphy Cherish the Ladies, Battlefield Band, Fairport Convention, Wishbone Ash, Bill Miller and many others.

Beginning in the early seventies, she has shown in museums, biennials and other institutions internationally including PS1 (Long Island City), the Whitney Museum of American Art (NY), First International Biennial of Contemporary Art of Cartegena de Indias (Colombia) The Alternative Museum (NY), Boca Raton Museum of Art, Contemporary Arts Museum (Houston) and Metr√≤nom (Barcelona), Museo do Pobo Galego (Santiago de Compostela) Work She began her professional career with public works in urbanscapes (Ch go and New York) and short films reflecting on sociological issues. Her first installation, 12 Hours of Territorial Intrusion, was created for Lives, an exhibition curated by Jeffrey Deitch at the Fine Arts Building in 1975. This was a photo/audio installation about personal space and the city, reflecting on the urban environment. Working mainly with the installation format over the last few decades, she utilizes whatever media best serves the content of the work blending sculptural elements, audio, slide projections, film projections, photography and/or video. The content of the works includes subjects as varied as rape and its resonances in women's lives, forced expulsions around the world, the lives of the Palestinians under occupation, the reality of life in refugee camps in Western Sahara, the Inquisition, terrorism, identity and other social and political themes. The works often include interviews as a main component. Recently, she has been exploring photographic installation (The Malaya Lola Project, Is This Where My Family Lived?, the ongoing and as yet untitled Western Sahara portrait series) and single-channel videos (Cuarenta, How the Other Half Lives). Berkowitz has also worked in collaboration with several other artists including Pawel Wojtasik (Three Chimneys, a video); Francesc Torres (Parabola da Abund√°ncia/The Tale of Plenty, a project at the Museo do Pobo Galego, 2017); and Karla Sachse, DDR and Varsha Nair, India/Thailand, (Barriers and Beyond, a video). Her research has taken her to places where people are living in dire conditions or have suffered through history including Gaza and the West Bank, the Strait of Gibraltar, the Philippines and the Western Sahara refugee camps near Tindouf, Algeria. In 1996‚Äì7, she became a Fulbright Senior Scholar and spent six months in Spain researching homes of Arabs and Jews who had been expelled five hundred years prior. This has led to an almost 20-year investigation into the subjects of forced expulsion, diaspora and the Inquisition. To date, she has realized several works dealing with this topic including Veil of Memory. Prologue: The Last Supper (Metr√≤nom in Barcelona, 1995; the First Biennial of Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 2014 and the Boca Raton Museum of Art in Florida, 2015). Since 1996, she has been a Professor of Art at Bernard M. Baruch College of the City University of New York. She became a Fulbright Scholar in 1996.
