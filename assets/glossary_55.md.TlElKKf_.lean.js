The climbing trunk is very thin, only 1‚Äì2 cm in diameter, but can reach 3 m in height. The apex of the trunk is covered in scales. Two types of fronds are produced, simple pinnate fronds, which are sterile, and bipinnate fronds, which may be fertile. The stipe is smooth, glossy and very dark, almost to the point of being black. It is covered at the base with long, very dark scales that have a pale margin. Fertile pinnules are distinctly stalked and lobed. Sori occur in four pairs per pinnule lobe and lack indusia. Alsophila biformis is a very unusual species, being a climbing or scrambling fern with a very thin trunk. Plants often cling to supporting trees by their roots. The closest relative of this species appears to be Alsophila scandens, which differs only in the shape of its fertile pinnules.

The island is located about from the nearest point on Prince Edward Island. The first visitors to Panmure Island were the Micmac First Nations Indians. The Micmac came to the island in the summer months to dig clams, mussels and quahaugs. The first full-time inhabitants of the island were settlers from Scotland, the first of which is believed to have been Andrew MacDonald and his family in 1805. The Panmure Island Cemetery was established in 1813. Panmure Island was connected to Prince Edward Island by sand bars at low tide, but since the 1960s, an artificial causeway has carried a road to the island. The causeway also created an extensive barrier beach and sand dune formation, which is now protected by Panmure Island Provincial Park; this park is not actually located on the island but along the causeway. The causeway has faced increased wave erosion in recent years and the provincial government has spent a significant amount to preserve the connection despite rising sea levels and increased storms. The island contains the oldest wooden lighthouse on Prince Edward Island, near the northern end of the causeway. Built in 1853, the historic lighthouse structure has gabled windows and four stories with a warning beacon atop. It sits on the northeast shore alerting ships of the dangerous shoals that have been responsible for several shipwrecks in the region. Tours of the lighthouse are available in the summer months. A school was built on the island in 1897 for $150, and had a total of seven pupils the first year.

His works have been reproduced in many books and are currently on display at several major museums in the United States. Biography =Early life= Knight was born in Brooklyn, New York City. As a child, Knight was deeply interested in nature and animals, and spent many hours copying the illustrations from his father's natural history books. Though legally blind because of astigmatism and a subsequent injury to his right eye, Knight pursued his artistic talents with the help of specially designed glasses, and at the age of twelve, he enrolled at the Metropolitan Art School to become a commercial artist. In 1890, he was hired by a church- decorating firm to design stained-glass windows, and after two years with them, became a freelance illustrator for books and magazines, specializing in nature scenes. Entelodon (then known as Elotherium), the first commissioned restoration of an extinct animal by Charles R. Knight. In his free time, Knight visited the American Museum of Natural History, attracting the attention of Dr. Jacob Wortman, who asked Knight to paint a restoration of a prehistoric pig, Elotherium, whose fossilized bones were on display. Knight applied his knowledge of modern pig anatomy, and used his imagination to fill in any gaps. Wortman was thrilled with the final result, and the museum soon commissioned Knight to produce an entire series of watercolors to grace their fossil halls. His paintings were hugely popular among visitors, and Knight continued to work with the museum until the late 1930s, painting what would become some of the world's most iconic images of dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals, and prehistoric humans. Laelaps by Charles R. Knight, 1897 One of Knight's best-known pieces for the American Museum of Natural History is 1897's Leaping Laelaps, which was one of the few pre-1960s images to present dinosaurs as active, fast-moving creatures (thus anticipating the \\"Dinosaur Renaissance\\" theories of modern paleontologists like Robert Bakker). Other familiar American Museum paintings include Knight's portrayals of Agathaumas, Allosaurus, Brontosaurus, Smilodon, and the Woolly Mammoth. All of these have been reproduced in numerous places and have inspired many imitations. Knight's work for the museum was not without critics, however: many curators argued that his work was more artistic than scientific, and protested that he did not have sufficient scientific expertise to render prehistoric animals as precisely as he did. While Knight himself agreed that his murals for the Hall of the Age of Man were \\"primarily a work of art,\\" he insisted that he had as much paleontological knowledge as the museum's own curators.Cain, Victoria. \\"'The Direct Medium of the Vision': Visual Education, Virtual Witnessing and the Prehistoric Past at the American Museum of Natural History, 1890-1923.\\" Journal of Visual Culture, 2010, 9: 284, pp. 292-298. =Nationwide attention= Smilodon from 1903. After Knight established a reputation at the American Museum of Natural History, other natural history museums began requesting paintings for their own fossil exhibits. In 1925, for example, Knight produced an elaborate mural for the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County which portrayed some of the birds and mammals whose remains had been found in the nearby La Brea Tar Pits. The following year, Knight began a 28-mural series for Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, a project which chronicled the history of life on earth and took four years to complete. At the Field Museum, he produced one of his best-known pieces, a mural featuring Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops. This confrontation scene between a predator and its prey became iconic and inspired a huge number of imitations, establishing these two dinosaurs as \\"mortal enemies\\" in the public consciousness. The Field Museum's Alexander Sherman says, \\"It is so well-loved that it has become the standard encounter for portraying the age of dinosaurs\\".\\"Charles Knight: Prehistoric Visions of a Beloved Muralist\\" 2002 Field Museum, In the Field article by Alexander Sherman Knight working on Stegosaurus in 1899. Knight's work also found its way to the Carnegie Museums in Pittsburgh, the Smithsonian Institution, and Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History, among others. Several zoos, such as the Bronx Zoo, the Lincoln Park Zoo, and the Brookfield Zoo, also approached Knight to paint murals of their living animals, and Knight enthusiastically complied. Knight was actually the only person in America allowed to paint Su Lin, a giant panda that lived at Brookfield Zoo during the 1930s. While making murals for museums and zoos, Knight continued illustrating books and magazines, and became a frequent contributor to National Geographic. He also wrote and illustrated several books of his own, such as Before the Dawn of History (Knight, 1935), Life Through the Ages (1946), Animal Drawing: Anatomy and Action for Artists (1947), and Prehistoric Man: The Great Adventure (1949). Additionally, Knight became a popular lecturer, describing prehistoric life to audiences across the country. Eventually, Knight began to retire from the public sphere to spend more time with his grandchildren, who shared his passion for animals and prehistoric life. In 1951, he painted his last work, a mural for the Everhart Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He died in New York City, two years later. Legacy Brontosaurus, 1897. Knight has been hailed as \\"one of the great popularizers of the prehistoric past\\", and as having influenced generations of museum- goers. Examples of Knight's work frequently appeared in dinosaur books published in the US during the first half of the twentieth century and countless other artists and illustrators borrowed heavily from Knight's conceptions of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. More recent works also include examples of Knight's paintings; for example, Stephen Jay Gould used one of Knight's paintings for the cover of his 1991 book Bully for Brontosaurus and another in his 1996 book Dinosaur in a Haystack. Though many other paleoartists have succeeded Knight (most notably Zdenƒõk Burian) Knight's paintings still remain very popular among dinosaur and paleontology enthusiasts. A commemorative edition of Knight's 1946 book Life Through the Ages was recently published by Indiana University Press, and a 2007 calendar of Knight's paintings is also currently available. Additionally, fantasy artist William Stout has compiled a series of Charles Knight Sketchbooks, which contain many rare and previously unpublished drawings and studies by Knight. Knight's restoration of Agathaumas from 1897, which was later used as basis for a model Agathaumas used in the 1925 film The Lost World.Marcel Delgado: The Man Who Made Monsters Retrieved October 1, 2009. Because Knight worked in an era when new and often fragmentary fossils were coming out of the American west in quantity, not all of his creations were based on solid evidence; dinosaurs such as his improbably-adorned Agathaumas (1897) for example, were somewhat speculative. His depictions of better-known ceratopsians as solitary animals inhabiting lush grassy landscapes were largely imaginative (the grasslands that feature in many of his paintings didn't appear until the Cenozoic). Although Knight sometimes made musculoskeletal studies of living animals, he did not do so for his dinosaur restorations, and he restored many dinosaurs with typical reptilian-like limbs and narrow hips (Paul, 1996). In the 1920s, studies by the celebrated palaeontologists Alfred Romer and Gerhard Heilmann (Heilmann, 1926) had confirmed that dinosaurs had broad avian-like hips rather than those of a typical reptile. Knight often restored extinct mammals, birds and marine reptiles in very dynamic action poses, but his depictions of large dinosaurs as ponderous swamp-dwellers destined for extinction reflected more traditional concepts (Paul, 1996). In his catalogue to Life through the Ages (1946), he reiterated views that he had written earlier (Knight, 1935), describing the great beasts as \\"slow-moving dunces\\" that were \\"unadaptable and unprogressive\\" while conceding that small dinosaurs had been more active. Some of his pictures are now known to be wrong, such as the tripod kangaroo-like posture of the hadrosaurs and theropods, whereas their spinal column was roughly horizontal at the hip; and the sauropods standing deeply in water whereas they were land-dwellers. Knight also drew dinosaur tails dragging on the ground, whereas they were held out approximately horizontally. Cro-Magnon artists painting in Font-de-Gaume, 1920 The late Stephen Jay Gould was one of Knight's most well-known fans, notably refusing to refer to Brontosaurus as \\"Apatosaurus\\" because Knight had always referred to the creature with the former name. Gould writes in his 1989 book Wonderful Life, \\"Not since the Lord himself showed his stuff to Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones had anyone shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, the most celebrated of artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day\\". Other admirers have included special effects artist Ray Harryhausen, who writes in his autobiography An Animated Life, \\"Long before Obie (Willis O'Brien), myself, and Steven Spielberg, he put flesh on creatures that no human had ever seen. [‚Ä¶] At the L.A. County Museum I vividly remember a beautiful Knight mural on one of the walls depicting the way the tar pits would have looked in ancient times. This, plus a picture book about Knight's work my mother gave me, were my first encounters with a man who was to prove an enormous help when the time came for me to make three-dimensional models of these extinct beings\\". Paleoartist Gregory S. Paul has also mentioned Knight as a big influence on him. In 2012, a book about Knight and his art written by Richard Milner titled Charles R. Knight The Artist Who Saw Through Time was published. An homage to the painter was also made in the 1998 IMAX feature film, T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous, in which he was portrayed by actor Tuck Milligan.

History  By the beginning 14th century, they were the most powerful family of eastern Switzerland, separating into four lines, Alt-Landenberg, Landenberg-Greifensee, Hohenlandenberg and Breitenlandenberg. The main line was extinct early, Rudolf I and his son Pantaleon both falling in the battle of Morgarten in 1315. The Landenberg- Greifensee line was the most successful during the 14th century but was outlived by the Hohenladenberg and Breitenlandenberg ones. Breitenlandenberg proved the most successful in the longer run, rising to significant power in the 15th century and lasting into the 19th. The influence of the Landenberg- Greifensee line peaked in the 1350s with Hermann IV, whose sons came into financial difficulties and had to sell a number of castles, among them Alt- Landenberg and Greifensee. The reasons for this decline was their close ties with the house of Habsburg, which was itself struggling with difficulties and losing its hold over the territory due to both the rise of the city of Z√ºrich and the growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy. The Breitenlandenberg and Hohenlandenberg lines overcame this crisis by allying themselves with Z√ºrich, adopting Z√ºrich citizenship. Their territorial influence remained confined to the Z√ºrcher Oberland due to the pressure of territorial expansion from both Z√ºrich and the Swiss Confederacy, but by the end of the 14th century they became again very wealthy and gave out major credits to the cities of Winterthur and Constance. The Hohenlandenberg line owned Andelfingen until 1434. The Breitenlandenberg line rose to great importance in Z√ºrichgau in the 15th century. They had Z√ºrich citizenship from the 14th century, and often intermarried with families of the Z√ºrich patriciate like Sch√§fli. They also entered the Old Z√ºrich War on the side of Z√ºrich, and Wildhans von Breitenlandenberg was beheaded with his entire garrison at the siege of Greifensee in 1444. The knights of Breitenlandenberg also fought with Z√ºrich, this time on the side of the Swiss, in the Burgundy Wars. They declined from the 16th century and sold the ancestral Breitenlandeberg castle in the 17th century, residing mostly in Z√ºrich, although they retained jurisdiction in a number of communes, at Salenstein into the 18th century. The male line of Breitenlandenberg was extinct in the 1870s.

In 1997, SJSU upset No. 24 Air Force, (25‚Äì22) their first win over a ranked opponent since 1990. In 2000, SJSU beat ninth-ranked TCU (27‚Äì24) ending their 12-game winning streak. Also in 2000, SJSU earned a mark of 7-5, their first winning season in eight years. His overall record at San Jose State University was 18‚Äì27. Baldwin served as the offensive coordinator for the Colorado State Rams of Colorado State University from 2012 until 2014. He also was the interim head coach for the Rams during the 2014 Las Vegas Bowl, following Jim McElwain's departure for the University of Florida. On December 20, 2014, following the Bowl Game, Baldwin along with the entire coaching staff received their termination papers. In 2015, Baldwin joined Oregon State as offensive coordinator and tight ends coach under Gary Andersen. The following season, Baldwin left his duties as offensive coordinator and became the inside receivers coach. He later became tight ends coach in 2017. Baldwin and other assistant coaches were fired on November 26, 2017 as Oregon State continued its coaching search, over a month after Andersen resigned and Cory Hall took over as interim head coach. Personal Baldwin is married and has three children. In 2015, Baldwin admitted he has been drinking 16 to 18 cans of Diet Coke a day for over 15 years.

Background The recapture of Constantinople by the Greeks in 1261 had sent Baldwin, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople, always impoverished, to seek aid in Western Europe for a crusade to recapture the throne of the Latin Empire for him. For some time, he had expected aid from Manfred of Sicily, who hoped (like his father, Emperor Frederick II) that a crusade might put him in better standing with the Papacy; but Manfred was ousted from Sicily in 1266 by Charles, acting for Pope Clement IV, severely discomfiting Baldwin. Baldwin was residing at the Papal court in Viterbo in 1267 when Clement arranged to reconcile the Emperor and the newly seated King. As the principal vassal of what remained of Baldwin's empire, William was keen to gain an overlord who might be the giver rather than the recipient of subsidy, and who could help defend the Principality against the Despotate of Epirus, which had worsted him in 1259 at the Battle of Pelagonia. His chancellor, Leonardo of Veruli, was sent to Viterbo to negotiate the treaty. Provisions The War of the Euboeote Succession (an inheritance dispute between William and the Lombard lords, or \\"terciers\\", of Euboea, backed by Venice) and his defeat at Pelagonia had left William's principality exhausted in resources. To obtain the aid of Charles, he was willing to cede Charles the Principality in return for life tenure there. The proposed marriage of William's elder daughter Isabelle with the Byzantine emperor's son Andronikos was to be broken off, and she was to marry Charles' son Philip. Furthermore, Charles would have the reversion of the principality should the couple have no issue, disinheriting Isabelle. William, somewhat reluctantly, agreed to these terms. The embarrassment of Baldwin, both political and financial, was quite severe, and Charles took advantage of it. Charles was to be confirmed in possession of Corfu and some cities in Albania, once the dowry of Helena of Epirus, and was to be given suzerainty over the Principality of Achaea and Baldwin's rights upon the Aegean islands, excepting Lesbos, Chios, Samos and Kos.Kenneth Meyer Setton, The Papacy and the Levant, 1204-1571: The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries p.104 For his part, Charles was to raise and maintain for a year an army of two thousand knights to conquer Constantinople; he would also receive a third of any territory his army reclaimed for the Emperor, other than the city of Constantinople. Finally, a marriage pact with a reversionary clause was agreed upon, like that made with William. Philip of Courtenay, son and heir of Baldwin, was to marry Beatrice of Sicily, second daughter of Charles. The rights of Philip to the Latin Empire would revert to Charles should he die without issue. The agreement was sealed on May 27, 1267. Consequences The treaty placed a heavy burden on Baldwin in forcing him to surrender his rights over Achaea (to which the Duchy of Athens was also subject), as it represented the richest part of his empire still in Frankish hands. Nonetheless, the growing power of Charles represented Baldwin's best chance to recover Constantinople, although had the crusade gone forth as planned, he would probably have found himself more ruled than ruler in the presence of Angevin arms. In the event, the launch of the Eighth Crusade delayed any expedition against Constantinople, and Michael VIII Palaeologus, by keeping afoot the project of unifying Greek and Latin Churches, had it put off until 1280. Baldwin had died in 1273, shortly after the nuptials of Philip and Beatrice. At the eleventh hour, the Sicilian Vespers put an end to all plans for the long-delayed crusade by burning the invasion fleet in Messina harbor. The subsequent war sapped the energy of the Angevins, and Constantinople remained safely beyond their grasp. The major practical effect of the treaty was to move Achaea into the Angevin orbit, a process accelerated in later years by Charles. Already invested in Albania, the Angevins would now be players in the politics of Frankish Greece until 1387. Unfortunately for them, the succession they had hoped to secure through the marriage pacts and reversionary clauses of the treaty would not go uncontested. When Charles' son Philip of Sicily died in 1271, having had no children by Isabelle, Charles duly claimed Achaea by reversion. However Isabelle, her younger sister, and their heirs would challenge the Angevins for the possession of the principality until 1383.

Stripped of his citizenship and forced to sell his company by the German government, he immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1934, where he purchased the newspaper Haaretz (which is still majority-owned by his descendants). In 1940, Schocken moved to the United States, where he founded Schocken Books. Biography =Germany= Salman Schocken (\\"S\\" in Salman pronounced \\"Z\\") was born on October 30, 1877, in Margonin, Posen, German Empire (today Poland), the son of a Jewish shopkeeper. In 1901, he moved to Zwickau, a German town in southwest Saxony, to help manage a department store owned by his brother, Simon. Together they built up the business and established a chain of Kaufhaus Schocken stores throughout Germany. Schocken is best remembered for commissioning German Jewish architect Erich Mendelsohn to design strikingly Modernist style branches in Nuremberg (1926), Stuttgart (1928), and Chemnitz (1930, the only one to survive). By 1930 the Schocken chain was one of the largest in Europe, with 20 stores. After his brother Simon's death in 1929, when his friend Franz Rosenzweig also died, Salman Schocken became sole owner of the chain.Asian Hoffman and Peter Cole, Sacred Trash: the lost and found world of the Cairo Geniza, New York: Schocken books, 2011, p. 113 ff., citing the biography of Schocken by Anthony David, The Patron (New York, 2004). In 1915, Schocken co-founded the Zionist journal Der Jude (with Martin Buber). Schocken would support Buber financially, as well as other Jewish writers such as Gerschom Scholem and S.Y. Agnon. In 1930 he established the Schocken Institute for Research on Hebrew Poetry in Berlin, a research center intended to discover and publish manuscripts of medieval Jewish poetry. The inspiration for this project was his longstanding dream of finding a Jewish equivalent for the foundational literature of Germany, such as the German epic poem The Nibelungenlied. In 1931, he founded the publishing company Schocken Verlag, which printed books by German Jewish writers such as Franz Kafka and Walter Benjamin, making their work widely available; they also reprinted the Buber-Rosenzweig translation of the Bible. These initiatives earned him the nickname \\"the mystical merchant\\" from his friend Scholem. In 1933, the Nazis stripped Schocken of his German citizenship. They forced him to sell his German enterprises to Merkur AG, but he managed to recover some of his property after World War II. =Palestine= In 1934 Schocken left Germany for Palestine. In Jerusalem, he built the Schocken Library, also designed by Erich Mendelsohn. He became a board member of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and bought the newspaper Haaretz for 23,000 pounds sterling in 1935. His eldest son, Gershom Schocken, became the chief editor in 1939 and held that position until his death in 1990. The Schocken family today has a 60% share of the newspaper. Salman Schocken also founded the Schocken Publishing House Ltd. and, in New York in 1945 with the aid of Hannah Arendt and Nahum Glatzer, opened another branch, Schocken Books. In 1987 Schocken Books became an imprint of the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group at Random House, owned by widely diversified media corporation Bertelsmann since 1998. Schocken became a board member of the Jewish National Fund and helped with the purchase of land in the Haifa Bay area. Schocken became the patron of Shmuel Yosef Agnon during his years in Germany. Recognizing Agnon's literary talent, Schocken paid him a stipend that relieved him of financial worries and allowed him to devote himself to writing. Agnon went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1966. =United States= In 1940 Schocken left Palestine with his family except for one son (Gershom), and settled in the United States. Schocken died of heart failure on August 6, 1959, while vacationing at an Alpine resort in Pontresina, Switzerland. He was buried in Israel. Family In 1910 Salman Schocken married Zerline (Lilli) Ehrmann, a twenty-year-old German Jewish woman from Frankfurt. They had four sons and one daughter. Their eldest son, Gustav Gershom Schocken, succeeded his father at the Schocken publishing house in Tel Aviv and at the Haaretz newspaper. Another son, Gideon Schocken, became a Haganah fighter and later a general and the head of the Manpower Directorate of the Israel Defense Forces. Schocken house in Jerusalem The home of Salman Schocken is at 7 Smolenskin Street in the Rehavia neighborhood of Jerusalem. It was designed by Erich Mendelsohn. The building, constructed of Jerusalem stone between 1934 and 1936, was originally surrounded by a spacious garden. In 1957, the property was sold to the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance, which invited another architect, Joseph Klarvin, to design an additional front wing of classrooms facing the street. Klarvin also added a third story, dispensing with the pergolas and blocking over the oval pool in the courtyard. Schocken also had a library built in Jerusalem for his significant book collection. The building was also designed by Erich Mendelsohn and was built at 6 Balfour Street. Today, the historic building is home to the Schocken Institute for Jewish Research of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. The Institute houses the Salman Schocken Library and other important archives and collections of Jewish and other books. Reparations On June 12, 2014, a court in Berlin awarded 50 million euros to Salman Schocken's surviving heirs in Israel as part of reparations for the seizure of Schocken AG by the Nazi regime in 1938.

History In January 1984, the voters of Camp, Morris, and Titus counties approved a community college district for the area. The campus (centrally located among the county seats of Daingerfield, Pittsburg, and Mount Pleasant) and facilities were quickly chosen and constructed - by the fall semester of 1985 the first classes were held. As a relatively modern campus with all new construction, NTCC has kept its main campus buildings of uniform appearance - all buildings are constructed of earth-tone brick with copper-tone metal roofs. In 2010, the College opened the new Elizabeth Hoggatt Whatley Agriculture complex, a Platinum-LEED certified classroom complex featuring the latest in alternative energy and environmentally-friendly technologies. The \\"net-zero\\" (producing more energy annually than it consumes) building is home to a Sustainable Agriculture program which teaches people to farm small acreages using a mixture of traditional and alternative farm methods, good business practices, and sensitivity to the long term environmental impact. In addition to the main campus, the College has the Industrial Technology Training Center in Mount Pleasant, and outreach centers in Naples, Tx, and Pittsburg, Tx. The Culinary Arts program is also in Pittsburg. The mission of the college is to offer \\"responsible and exemplary learning opportunities.\\" The college song is \\"Eagles Soaring On.\\" NTCC is governed by a seven-member Board of Trustees. Three members are from Titus County, and two members each are from Morris and Camp counties. Academics As with other community colleges, NTCC offers basic core courses which can lead to Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degrees, and/or transfer to four-year universities, as well as Associate of Applied Science degrees and certificates which allow students to immediately enter the workforce. NTCC also offers concurrent enrollment options for high school juniors and seniors. NTCC students may obtain bachelor's degrees from Texas A&M; University-Texarkana in the fields of teacher education and criminal justice, while taking all classes at the NTCC campus. NTCC and Texas A & M University at College Station have entered into an articulation agreement to provide a seamless transition for students who completed the Associate of Science Degree in Biomedical Science at NTCC to a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biomedical Science at Texas A & M. NTCC students must complete the A.S. degree with a 3.6 GPA, with no grades below \\"B\\" in science and math. For high-achieving students, NTCC initiated an honors program in the spring of 2007. Each fall, fifteen Presidential Scholars are selected. Graduating seniors and freshmen with exemplary grades are admitted. Students from NTCC's award-winning honors program have presented work at the Great Plains Honors Conference, and the National Collegiate Honors Conference. The Eagle is the official student monthly newspaper, staffed by students. Print issues are published every month during the fall and spring semesters.The Eagle website Student housing NTCC has housing for 214 students.

Examples  Examples of groups that are residually finite are finite groups, free groups, finitely generated nilpotent groups, polycyclic- by-finite groups, finitely generated linear groups, and fundamental groups of 3-manifolds. Subgroups of residually finite groups are residually finite, and direct products of residually finite groups are residually finite. Any inverse limit of residually finite groups is residually finite. In particular, all profinite groups are residually finite. Examples of non-residually finite groups can be constructed using the fact that all finitely generated residually finite groups are Hopfian groups. For example the Baumslag‚ÄìSolitar group B(2,3) is not Hopfian, and therefore not residually finite.  Profinite topology  Every group G may be made into a topological group by taking as a basis of open neighbourhoods of the identity, the collection of all normal subgroups of finite index in G. The resulting topology is called the profinite topology on G. A group is residually finite if, and only if, its profinite topology is Hausdorff. A group whose cyclic subgroups are closed in the profinite topology is said to be \\\\Pi_C\\\\,. Groups, each of whose finitely generated subgroups are closed in the profinite topology are called subgroup separable (also LERF, for locally extended residually finite). A group in which every conjugacy class is closed in the profinite topology is called conjugacy separable.  Varieties of residually finite groups  One question is: what are the properties of a variety all of whose groups are residually finite? Two results about these are: * Any variety comprising only residually finite groups is generated by an A-group. * For any variety comprising only residually finite groups, it contains a finite group such that all members are embedded in a direct product of that finite group.

Foundation and approach  NCBI was founded by Cherie R. Brown in 1984. The group works to help eliminate prejudice and intergroup conflict in communities throughout the world. Its approach is based on Re-evaluation Counseling (or co- counselling), which was founded in the 1950s by Harvey Jackins. Jackins wrotethat \\"The re-emergence from distress patterns which we co-counsel to achieve is the dependably long-range channel for achieving the liberation of humans from all oppressions.\\"Harvey Jackins, The Human Situation, Rational Island Press, p.108 NCBI trains community leaders in skills designed to reduce intergroup conflicts. They believe that no type of oppression (racism, classism, sexism, etc.) takes priority over another. Their work focuses on sharing personal stories of discrimination and mistreatment without shaming or blaming the perpetrators, and on building allies in other groups, so that members of who they regard as oppressed groups are not isolated.  Chapters and affiliates  Currently NCBI has 50 city-based leadership teams, known as NCBI Chapters; 30 organization-based leadership teams, known as NCBI Affiliates; and 61 college/university-based teams, known as Campus Affiliates. Most NCBI chapters include participants from public and private schools, local businesses, law enforcement agencies, religious institutions, community organizations, trade unions, and government offices. The local leadership includes elected officials, law enforcement officers, government workers, educators, students, business executives, labor union leaders, community activists, and religious leaders. These community leaders work together as a resource team to deal with prejudice and intergroup tensions. NCBI teams meet regularly and lead prejudice reduction programs for organizations in their communities, and they intervene with conflict resolution skills when intergroup conflicts arise. They may also offer programs that aim to help organizations to build inclusive environments. NCBI has conducted diversity programs on college campuses. There are active Campus Affiliates at 65 colleges and universities in the United States and Canada. An NCBI Campus Affiliate consists of a representative cross-section of students, faculty, and administrators, trained by NCBI, in order to provide a proactive response to what they believe to be discrimination and inter-group conflict on campus. The NCBI-trained team offers year-long leadership workshops that aim to create a more inclusive campus environment. Participants in the team-led workshops acquire skills designed to change what NCBI regard as prejudicial attitudes and learn how to become more effective allies for one another. A college or university becomes an NCBI Campus Affiliate by paying a lead trainer from NCBI headquarters to lead a three-day Train-the-Trainer Seminar. In this training, campus participants learn how to lead the eight-hour Prejudice Reduction Workshop and the NCBI Controversial Issue Process. Following the Train-the- Trainer Seminar, NCBI, in consultation with the sponsoring institution, selects a Campus Affiliate Director. The Affiliate Director leads the campus team and serves as the liaison with the NCBI National Office. The NCBI Campus Program Director, an experienced campus consultant, offers monthly telephone support and supervision to the Affiliate Director. Members of the campus team also receive ongoing training and support through monthly campus meetings as well as through NCBI's Annual National Campus Conference, where Campus Affiliates share resources and information on best practices. Chapters contribute 10% of income generated from fee-for-service work back to NCBI headquarters. No chapters have paid full-time staff and are generally run from a combination of volunteers and paid consultants who conduct trainings and related programs in their local community.

Motifs Sir Walter Scott claimed to have been told a similar story by a woman in Shetland, and based his poem Advertisement to the Pirate upon it.Barry Taylor, \\"Lady Margaret\\" He recounted the story of a woman who, finding her lover dead in London, touched his hand to free herself from the visit of his ghost.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 227, Dover Publications, New York 1965 Variants The ballad shows the influence of Clerk Saunders and Proud Lady Margaret.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 226-7, Dover Publications, New York 1965 Other ballads with a similar theme include *\\"Fair Margaret and Sweet William\\" *\\"The Unquiet Grave\\" A Canadian version of this ballad exists entitled \\"Lady Margaret\\", similar in structure to an American ballad of the same name based upon \\"Fair Margaret and Sweet William\\". This form of ballad is also known in many Scandinavian variants (TSB A 67), although the ghost returns not for its freedom from its pledge, but because the woman's grief is harming it.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 228, Dover Publications, New York 1965 This ballad was one of 25 traditional works included in Ballads Weird and Wonderful (1912) and illustrated by Vernon Hill (sculptor).

At the Earth's Core is a 1914 fantasy novel by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, the first in his series about the fictional \\"hollow earth\\" land of Pellucidar. It first appeared as a four-part serial in All-Story Weekly from April 4‚Äì25, 1914. It was first published in book form in hardcover by A. C. McClurg in July, 1922. Plot summary The author relates how, traveling in the Sahara desert, he has encountered a remarkable vehicle and its pilot, David Innes, a man with a remarkable story to tell. David Innes is a mining heir who finances the experimental \\"iron mole,\\" an excavating vehicle designed by his elderly inventor friend Abner Perry. In a test run, they discover the vehicle cannot be turned, and it burrows 500 miles into the Earth's crust, emerging into the unknown interior world of Pellucidar. In Burroughs' concept, the Earth is a hollow shell with Pellucidar as the internal surface of that shell. Pellucidar is inhabited by prehistoric creatures of all geological eras, and dominated by the Mahars, a species of flying reptile both intelligent and civilized, but which enslaves and preys on the local stone-age humans. Innes and Perry are captured by the Mahars' ape-like Sagoth servants and taken with other human captives to the chief Mahar city of Phutra. Among their fellow captives are the brave Ghak, the Hairy One, from the country of Sari, the shifty Hooja the Sly One and the lovely Dian the Beautiful of Amoz. David Innes, attracted to Dian the Beautiful, defends her against the unwanted attentions of Hooja the Sly One, but due to his ignorance of local customs she assumes he wants her as a slave, not a friend or lover, and subsequently snubs him. Only later, after Hooja slips their captors in a dark tunnel and forces Dian to leave with him, does David learn from Ghak the cause of the misunderstanding. First paperback edition of At the Earth's Core, 1962. Cover by Roy Krenkel. In Phutra the captives become slaves, and the two surface worlders learn more of Pellucidar and Mahar society. The Mahars are all female, reproducing parthogenetically by means of a closely guarded \\"Great Secret\\" contained in a Mahar book. David learns that they also feast on selected human captives in a secret ritual. In a disturbance, David manages to escape Phutra, becomes lost, and experiences a number of adventures before sneaking back into the city. Rejoining Abner, he finds the latter did not even realize he was gone, and the two discover that time in Pellucidar, in the absence of objective means to measure it, is a subjective thing, experienced by different people at different rates. Obsessed with righting the wrong he has unwittingly done Dian, David Innes escapes again and eventually finds and wins her by defeating the malevolent Jubal the Ugly One, another unwanted suitor. David makes amends, and he and Dian wed. Later, along with Ghak and other allies, David Innes and Abner Perry lead a revolt of humankind against the cruel Mahars. Their foes are hampered by the loss of the Great Secret, which David has stolen and hidden. To further the struggle David returns to the Iron Mole, in which he and Dian propose to travel back to the surface world to procure outer world technology. Only after it is underway does he discover that Hooja the Sly One has substituted a drugged Mahar for Dian the Beautiful. Back in the world we know David meets the author, who after hearing his tale and seeing his prehistoric captive, helps him resupply and prepare the mole for the return to Pellucidar. Critical reception Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale, discussing the 1962 paperback edition, praised the novel; he said that \\"Burroughs's concepts are intriguing and his combat scenes gripping.\\" Gale faulted the novel's style, noting that \\"the reader must wade at least twenty-five pages into the book before he can cease to be annoyed by the author's stilted and florid style\\", but promised that \\"by then he has reached the point of no return\\". Adaptations The novel was filmed as At the Earth's Core (1976), directed by Kevin Connor and starring Doug McClure as David Innes and Peter Cushing as Abner Perry. When DC Comics gained the license to adapt the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, they managed to adapt the first Pellucidar book, with Len Wein scripting, and various artists such as Mike Kaluta and Murphy Anderson on art. The adaptation started out Korak, Son of Tarzan #46, then moved to Weird Worlds, where it ran from #1-6. The 2008 movie Journey to Middle Earth also shares several similarities with the events and locations of the novel, although the film was intended as a loose adaptation of Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne. Legacy Other authors have been inspired by Burroughs' depiction of the strange subterranean world, most notably H.P. Lovecraft whose At the Mountains of Madness was heavily influenced by At the Earth's Core, particularly in the name of the Elder Things' slave race, the Shoggoths.William Fulwiler, \\"E.R.B. and H.P.L.\\", Black Forbidden Things, p. 64. Another and more direct homage to Burroughs' concept is Lin Carter's \\"Zanthodon\\" series, beginning with his novel Journey to the Underground World. Prolific manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori also loosely adapted the book for the final story arc of the original Cyborg 009 manga.

His forefathers were Jats from Tewatia Gotra who had built a fort in Faridabad around 1739. He was involved in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The small kingdom of Ballabhgarh is only 20 miles from Delhi. His palace is taken over by the government of Haryana under Haryana Tourism. Nahar Singh Stadium in Faridabad is named after him. The Raja Nahar Singh metro station in Violet line is also named after the martyr.  Early life  Raja Nahar Singh Tewatia Ballabhgarh State was an important princely state founded by Jats of Tewatia clan. Balram Singh Tewatia, who was the brother-in-law of Maharaja Suraj Mal Sinsinwar of Bharatpur State, was the first ruler of Ballabhgarh State, and Nahar Singh was his descendant. His teachers included Pandit Kulkarni and Maulvi Rahman Khan. His father died in 1830, when he was about 9 years old. He was brought up by his uncle Nawal Singh, who took over the responsibility of running the state affairs. Nahar Singh was crowned in 1839. Secular ruler He was an able and secular ruler who promoted communal harmony, his letter (31 July 1857) to Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar says: He even made a gift of 4 villages to his Muslim court musician Umra Khan of Delhi gharana, a gift that included \\"the village of melody\\" Samaypur which is currently a locality of Ballabhgarh town (not to be confused with Samaypur in north Delhi).Bonnie C.

The Chiefs of the last two estates remained loyal to the British and others rebelled.[Madan Gopal, 1977, Sir Chhotu Ram: a political biography, Page 9. The Rajput rulers of Rajasthan also kept out of the rebellion. British forces met with a tough resistance right on the doorstep of the Capital when Nahar Singh, the Jat ruler of Ballabhgarh state, finally halted the British Juggernaut.1985, Organiser, Volume 37. Nahar refused to extend any help to District Collector William Ford, who was collecting forces to curb the uprising. Nahar actively recruited sepoys of the native infantry or cavalry, who revolted against the British, in services of his Ballbhgarh forces with enhanced pay and promotional ranks. Munshi Jeevan Lal writes, \\"by 17 July 1857 the Raja had taken into his service 200 troopers who had lately been in the employ of the English.\\" The number continued to swell in the subsequent period. Incidentally, one such sepoy who was granted rank of Naik, appeared as a witness to testify the fact before the British Military Commission, which was established to prosecute Raja Nahar Singh. To further fortify his armed strength, the Raja not only raised new levies but also collected as much as possible latest weaponry and other war material as was revealed from the recovery of large number of horses, bullocks, carts, English rifles and dresses from his fort after the British assaulted it.[Hari Singh Boparai, 2000, Revolt of 1857 in Punjab and role of the Sikhs, Page 48. He revolted against the British rule, and joined the forces led by Emperor Bahadur Shah. In a letters to Bahadur Shah Zafar dated 22 May and 25 May 1857, Raja Nahar wrote that he had secured the road from Delhi Gate (Delhi) to Bhadrapur (Bharatpur), as well as drove the British away from the parganas of Pali (Rajasthan), Palwal and Fatehpur.1859, Accounts and Papers of the House of Commons, Great Britain Parliament House of Commons, Page 32.Fatehpur in Haryana between Jhajjar and Gurugram on Haryana-Delhi Raja Nahar Singh of Ballabhgarh supported the Revolutionary Government and faithfully obeyed the instructions issued to him in connection with the maintenance of peace and order, recruitment of forces and collection of funds for the War.Syed Moinul Haq, 1968, The Great Revolution of 1857, Page 238. Death Nahar Singh, the Raja of Ballabgarh was 32 years old when he threw his small army into the fray against the British during the 1857 uprising.

Aftermath After Nahar's property was ceased by British and his estate was abolished. A political pension of Rs. 6,000 a year was settled upon Nahar's heir-apparent and adopted son who was his nephew, Kushal Singh.

For their participation in 1857 rebellion, three main chiefs of Haryana were tried and hanged at Kotwali in Chandani Chowk of Old Delhi. Nahar Singh, the Raja of Ballabhgarh, was hanged on 9 January 1858. Abdur Rehman, Nawab of Jhajjar, was hanged on 23 January 1858. Ahmad Ali, Nawab of Farrukhnagar, was hanged on 23 January 1858. The Chaudharys and Lambardars of villages who participated in rebellion were also deprived of their land and property, including 368 people of Hisar and Gurugram were hanged or transported for life, and fine was imposed on the people of Thanesar (Rs 2,35,000), Ambala (Rs. 2,53,541) and Rohtak (Rs. 63,000 mostly on Ranghars, Shaikhs and Muslim Kasai).Satish Chandra Mittal, 1986, Haryana, a Historical Perspective, p58.

It was also served by trains of the Fulton Street Elevated until that line closed in 1956. It is located roughly at the intersection of Broadway, Fulton Street and Van Sinderen Avenue at the border of Bedford- Stuyvesant and East New York, Brooklyn. The complex is served by the A, J, and L trains at all times; the C train at all times except late nights; and the Z train during rush hours in the peak direction only. The station is adjacent to the East New York Yard and a complex track junction between the tracks leading to the yard, the Canarsie Line, and the Jamaica Line. The structure of the elevated station still contains the ironwork for the trackways used by the old Fulton Elevated. The station has a single exit and entrance through a fare control building located at the eastern end of the Fulton Street Line station. There is evidence of closed exits from the Jamaica Line platforms. The station opened as Manhattan Junction as part of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line in 1885. In 1900, an elevated connection was made with the Fulton Street Elevated, resulting in a change in service patterns. Lexington Avenue and Fulton Street trains were through-routing, going around the East New York Loop, with service to Cypress Hills requiring a transfer. The station started to be used by service to Canarsie in 1906. In 1919, the Manhattan Junction station was replaced by the current station which was then known as Eastern Parkway. The modern-day Canarsie Line platforms, known as Broadway Junction, opened in 1928 when that line was connected to the 14th Street‚ÄìEastern District Line. The Independent Subway System's Fulton Street Line was extended to Broadway‚ÄìEast New York in 1946, and the three stations were combined as one station complex on July 1, 1948. The names of the stations in the complex were conformed to Broadway Junction in 2003. Although Broadway Junction ranked 166th in the system for passenger entries in 2016, with 3,085,401 total entries, it is Brooklyn's third-busiest station in terms of passenger activity. It sees 100,000 passengers per day , the vast majority of whom use it to make transfers. In 2017, the New York City Economic Development Corporation started studying options to rezone the surrounding area as a transit hub.Hu, Winnie. \\"A Tired Brooklyn Transit Hub Is Finally Getting Attention; New York City officials aim to transform Broadway Junction from a pass-through to a destination stop with offices, stores, restaurants and other amenities.\\", The New York Times, November 26, 2017. Accessed November 27, 2017. \\"Currently, about 100,000 riders pass through Broadway Junction every weekday, making it the third busiest station in Brooklyn, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Most riders are transferring between the various lines.\\" __TOC__  History  Looking west at the complex's head house and Callahan-Kelly Playground, located above the IND station. Broadway Junction is a New York City Subway station complex shared by the elevated BMT Canarsie and BMT Jamaica Lines, and the underground IND Fulton Street Line. Throughout the history of the area, this has been a key junction point between various different rail lines. What is now Broadway Junction sits atop the historical Jamaica Pass, the junction of the modern Broadway, Fulton Street, and Jamaica Avenue. The Pass is where these roads passed through the valleys of the area, which are part of the terminal moraine created by the Wisconsin glaciation. The first rail service in the area was the Atlantic Branch of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) at East New York station. The line opened as the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad in 1836, under lease to the LIRR, but did not include a station at East New York until early 1843. The Brooklyn and Rockaway Beach Railroad (the predecessor to the BMT Canarsie Line) began service in the area in 1865. The name Manhattan Junction or Manhattan Beach Junction was applied to the station on what is now the Jamaica Line when it opened in 1885; the area had been known as Manhattan Beach Crossing since before then, due to the crossing of the LIRR's Manhattan Beach Division. A station on the Fulton Street Elevated railroad at Sackman Street opened on July 4, 1889, when the line was extended to Atlantic Avenue. Passageway above the Jamaica Line platforms, leading to the Canarsie Line platforms A two-track, one-half-block elevated connection was built on the east side of Vesta Avenue (now Van Sinderen Avenue) between the Fulton Street and Broadway Lines. This connection, equipped with a third rail to supply electric power, was opened on August 9, 1900, and new service patterns were implemented: during times other than rush hours, Lexington Avenue and Fulton Street trains were through- routed, and travel beyond Manhattan Junction required a transfer. This \\"East New York Loop\\" was unpopular, and was soon stopped; the next service to use the tracks was the BMT Canarsie Line to Broadway Ferry (later the 15 train), joined to the Fulton Street Line at Pitkin and Snediker Avenues in 1906. The name was changed from Manhattan Junction to Broadway Junction in 1913. The Dual Contracts were signed on March 19, 1913 between the City and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT). As part of the agreement, the BRT, which owned the elevated lines in Brooklyn, agreed to construct bidirectional express tracks on the Fulton and Broadway Elevateds. The Broadway express track was placed into service on December 23, 1916. The current Broadway Elevated station at Eastern Parkway opened on August 5, 1919, replacing the old Manhattan Junction station. The full BMT 14th Street-Canarsie Line was completed on July 14, 1928 with the opening of the segment connecting Broadway Junction with Montrose Avenue. By 1936, the Independent Subway System's Fulton Street Line had been extended to Rockaway Avenue. At that time, Broadway Junction was an all-Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit (BMT) transfer point. Further eastward extension of the line was delayed by World War II; the Broadway‚ÄìEast New York station opened on December 30, 1946. A direct escalator passageway was constructed between the IND and BMT stations in East New York to allow passengers free transfers. The passageway opened on July 1, 1948. The Fulton Street Elevated was now redundant, and BMT service on the line closed entirely on April 26, 1956, with the eastern portion to Lefferts Boulevard connected to the IND. The entire complex was renovated from 1999 to 2001. The design bid for the project was awarded in May 1996. As part of the project, an abandoned mezzanine and adjacent staircases were removed, a new station booth was built and the public address system was improved. In 2001, as part of the work a piece of artwork made by Al Loving titled Brooklyn, New Morning was installed in the station. This piece of art consists of 75 unique glass panels arranged in a series throughout the complex and a mosaic mural wall that is seven-by-ten feet. This installation was part of MTA Arts & Design's program to install artwork in stations that undergo rehabilitations. Other necessary improvements were also completed as part of the project. For a long time, the stations within the complex went by three different names: the original Eastern Parkway on the BMT Jamaica Line, Broadway Junction on the BMT Canarsie Line, and Broadway‚ÄìEast New York (IND Fulton Street Line). Conformity between the station names was established in 2003. As part of a project initiated in 2017 in which 200 blocks of land in East New York were rezoned for housing and improvements to area parks and schools were planned, the New York City Economic Development Corporation initiated a study to foster economic growth around Broadway Junction as a transit hub with residential and commercial uses. In 2018, the MTA announced several further improvements to the Broadway Junction station: new elevators for the Fulton Street Line platforms, as well as staircases for the Canarsie Line platforms and Jamaica Line platforms. Station layout The station complex is composed of three stations: the two elevated stations on the BMT Jamaica and Canarsie Lines, as well as the underground station on the IND Fulton Street Line. The IND station is accessible from the station's ground-level station house, at the east end of the station complex, using staircases down to platform level. The BMT lines are reachable from that same station house via escalators from street level to the upper mezzanine, which is located over the elevated BMT Jamaica Line platforms and at the BMT Canarsie Line's platform level. The two escalators, which were replaced in 2000, are long and steep. A footbridge leads from the upper mezzanine to the BMT Canarsie Line's northbound platform. Despite having being renovated in the late 1990s, the Broadway Junction complex does not conform to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and there are no elevators in the station because the different parts of the complex are too far from each other. Because Broadway Junction is a major transfer station, the community identified this lack of access as a major issue. Calls for elevators were renewed in 2017, after the announcement of the L train shutdown in 2019‚Äì2020, which temporarily restricts Canarsie Line service to Manhattan during off-peak hours. In January 2018, the MTA announced that the IND Fulton Street Line platforms would receive elevators, and that elevators were also being studied for the BMT Jamaica Line platforms. However, the BMT Canarsie Line platforms are not expected to receive these improvements.  =Exit= The fare control area is in the station house, with a token booth and turnstile banks. The structure was built along with the IND station. The station house leads to Van Sinderen Avenue between Fulton Street to the south, and Truxton Street and Broadway to the north. This is the only entrance to the entire complex. There is also a police precinct located in the station house, NYPD Transit Police District 33, at the south end of the building. The station was previously part of Transit Police District 23. The station house is adjacent to Callahan-Kelly Playground, and is recessed a short distance west from Van Sinderen Avenue. A ventilation structure for the IND line sits at the west end of the park at Sackman Street. There have been planning studies to build a new entrance in this area.  BMT Canarsie Line platforms  Broadway Junction on the BMT Canarsie Line has two tracks, one island platform, and one side platform. Manhattan-bound trains use the island platform for northbound service while Canarsie-bound trains use the side platform for southbound service, similar to the configuration of the Bowling Green station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. However, unlike Bowling Green, the southbound trains can use the island platform if necessary. This station opened on July 14, 1928 as the final section of the 14th Street‚ÄìEastern District Line, now part of the Canarsie Line, opened between Montrose Avenue and Broadway Junction. This new line allowed trains from Canarsie to run via the 14th Street Line in Manhattan in addition to the Nassau Street Line. The station is one of the highest elevated platforms in the city, sitting above the already-elevated BMT Jamaica Line. As high as this station platform is, it plunges abruptly into a tunnel at the north end. This end of the station slopes sharply downward, and the platform end is about away from the tunnel's portal. A diamond crossover was installed here between 1998 and 2001. The south end of the northbound platform divides into two, with a central gap between the two legs. Two normally-unused tracks connect the Canarsie and Jamaica lines. The southbound track can be seen emerging beneath the two legs of the northbound platform; the northbound flyover with its severe curve can be seen just east of the station, beginning near the signal tower. During 1999, this station underwent a series of renovations, including new canopies, a new crossover (known as 'The Barn' because of its rustic red siding and white trim), and the removal of a hazardous crossunder. The old-style platform lights were removed and replaced with light fixtures that curve upward and split into two lights, widely seen elsewhere in the system. In March 2018, in preparation for the L train shutdown, the MTA announced that it would be installing two extra staircases to the BMT Canarsie Line platforms; at the time, there was only one passageway to each platform.  BMT Jamaica Line platforms  Broadway Junction is an express station on the BMT Jamaica Line that has three tracks and two island platforms. The middle express track is not used by regular service. At each end of the station there are track connections to the East New York Yard. Trains that run to or from that yard can terminate or begin at this station. The station was originally called Eastern Parkway, named for its original exit on the extreme west end of the platforms. This entrance is now closed, though the street stairs and station house are still present. A second fare control area, a mezzanine, at Conway Street in the middle of the platforms was also closed, and was removed in the 2000s as part of the station's renovation. The ironwork for the old Fulton Elevated trackways can be seen under this portion of the complex from the platforms. Two staircases from each platform lead to the upper mezzanine of the complex. The mezzanine is above the platforms and connects to the Canarsie Line and to the exit at street level via two long escalators. At street level, there is a transfer to the underground IND Fulton Street Line and the fare control area. As part of the 2015‚Äì2019 Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Capital Program, station capacity enhancements will be made at the station. The project will assess the feasibility of building two additional staircases from each platform to the mezzanine to reduce platform congestion. Design work started in February 2017, and was finished in August 2017. The project was being bid on , work began in July 2018, and the new staircases were finished around October 2018.

IND Fulton Street Line platforms  Broadway Junction on the IND Fulton Street Line, formerly called Broadway‚ÄìEast New York, is a standard express station with four tracks and two island platforms. The land for the station was acquired by the city in 1938, and in order to construct the station and other utilities, the land had to be cleared of buildings. Some of the land was given to the New York City Parks Department in 1945 for the construction of Callahan-Kelly Playground, which was named after two local soldiers who died during World War I. The station was nearly complete when the United States' entrance into World War II in 1941 halted construction due to material shortages. Work resumed following the war to install the necessary signals, tracks and complete the escalators to the BMT platforms. The contract for the escalator was awarded on November 7, 1945 to the Otis Elevator Company. The station opened on December 30, 1946, while the escalator was completed on July 1, 1948 after supply delays. In the early 1950s, the platforms were extended to to accommodate 11-car trains. The station's tile band is unique in that it incorporates two types of tile‚Äìgloss and matte‚Äìin contrasting shades of cobalt blue (gloss border) and blueberry (matte center). When the station was renamed in 2003, the \\"EAST NY\\" tiles on the wall were removed and replaced by tiles reading \\"JUNCTION\\", in the matching IND copperplate font. There is an active control tower just past the head end of the Queens-bound platform. East of the station, the tunnel widens on both sides to accommodate an additional trackway diverging from the local tracks. These bellmouths, one of which has an emergency exit, were built for a proposed extension along the BMT Jamaica Line, or for a proposed Jamaica Avenue Subway. (The bellmouth can be seen towards the right, at the 5:40 mark in the video, just before the train enters the Broadway Junction station) They were not a provision for the IND Second System, as were similar structures on other IND lines, but rather date from an earlier plan for the IND Fulton Street Line, which would have connected the IND tracks west of the station to two lines to the east of the station: the BMT Jamaica Line tracks, and the BMT Fulton Street Line tracks to Lefferts Boulevard, which were eventually connected to the IND Fulton Street Line anyway, albeit past Grant Avenue.

BMT Fulton Street Line platforms  Manhattan Junction was the original name for the Fulton Street Elevated platforms. It was located above Fulton and Sackman Streets, and was the second station to be built in the area of Broadway Junction. The station was built by the Kings County Elevated Railway on July 4, 1889. Manhattan Junction station had an island platform and two tracks, with a spur leading to the East New York Yard, as well as a side platform on the north side of the station that turned north along the East New York Loop, and ended on the south side of the BMT Jamaica Line platforms. The line was originally double tracked; a third track was added in the mid-1910s as part of the Dual Contracts expansion of the line between Nostrand Avenue and Hinsdale Street. In 1938, the Independent Subway System began constructing their own Fulton Street Subway and added an underground subway station named Broadway-East New York station. Stations west of this point were being made obsolete as many were being replaced by the subway stations. The subway station opened in December 1946, and the elevated station above it closed on April 26, 1956, along with all other stations east of Rockaway Avenue. The ironwork for the old Fulton Elevated trackways can still be found over Fulton Street between Van Sinderen Avenue and Williams Place, and can be seen under this portion of the complex from the Canarsie Line platforms. The severed connection between the station and the East New York Yard can also be seen below the Canarsie Line and above the north side of Fulton Street. Ridership In 2016, the station had 3,085,401 boardings, making it the 166th most used station in the 422-station system. This amounted to an average of 9,189 passengers per weekday. In 2017, The New York Times wrote that 100,000 daily passengers used the station per day, meaning that the vast majority of passengers used the station to make transfers to other routes.

He conducted numerous major orchestras across Europe, including the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Rome Philharmonic Orchestra. Ahn composed \\"Aegukga\\", a song best known as the national anthem of South Korea, Korean Dance, Nongae, and the Symphonic Fantasy Korea. His unpublished works, some of which have been discovered recently, include Poema Synfonic ‚ÄòMallorca, Lo Pi Formentor, and The Death of Emperor Gojong. Ahn Eak-tai was born in the northern part of the Korean peninsula just before the Colonial Era, and attended a school staffed by Catholic missionaries. There he developed an interest in music as he played a trumpet in the school orchestra. He received his higher education from the Kunitachi Music School in Japan, at the University of Cincinnati, and at the Curtis Institute of Music in the United States during the Great Depression. Ahn continued his study at Vienna under Bernhard Paumgartner, and under Zolt√°n Kod√°ly at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University in Hungary. Upon a second visit to Vienna, Ahn received assistance from Richard Strauss to bring Symphonic Fantasy Korea to near completion. Beginning with a concert in Budapest, Ahn spent the next five years conducting in Europe. The escalation of World War II brought Ahn to Spain, where he met Lolita Talavera, his future wife. After their marriage in 1946, the two moved to the United States, where Ahn conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra. Then, in 1955, Ahn returned to South Korea, and conducted the Seoul Philharmonic until his death.  Early life and education  Ahn was born into a wealthy family in the city of Pyongyang, now the capital of North Korea, on December 5, 1906, four years before Korea fell under Japanese rule in 1910. His family was a branch of the Ahn clan rooted in the region of Sunheung, part of Yeongju, North Gyeongsang province. The clan is renowned for having produced influential Korean figures such as An Jung-geun and An Chang-ho in the period. Ahn Eak-tai was the third son of his father, Ahn Deok-hun (ÏïàÎçïÌõà) and mother, Kim Jeong-ok (ÍπÄÏ†ïÏò•) According to the school record on Ahn Eak-taik at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, his mother's name is styled as \\"Ahn, Dungook\\"; \\"Ahn\\" being used instead of her maiden surname of \\"Kim\\", following the Western convention for married women, and \\"Dungook\\" being a direct transcription of Pyongyang dialect. Ahn Eak-tai had six siblings. His father, Ahn Deok-hun, ran a hotel business and wanted his children to receive advanced Western education. His eldest son, Ahn Eak-sam, was sent to Tokyo to study. In the meanwhile, Ahn Eak-tai was drawn into music and sang hymns at a village church. Ahn Eak-sam was well aware of his younger brother's interest in music, and so bought him a Suzuki violin, a phonograph and records from Japan.p. 8 Baek Sukgi Ahn Eak-tai started playing the violin and began to develop his musical talent early on. In 1914, he entered Pyongyang Jongno Elementary School (ÌèâÏñëÏ¢ÖÎ°úÎ≥¥ÌÜµÌïôÍµê) and began to play the trumpet. In 1918, he was admitted to the Pyongyang Soongsil Middle School, where he played in the school orchestra. He received a cello from Eak-sam and the Rev. Dr. Eli Miller Mowry, the American principal of the school, as a congratulatory gift.p. 10 Baek Sukgi introduced a music teacher at YMCA, Mr. Greg to him for a private cello lesson. In 1919, the Rev. Mowry led the school orchestra in participating in the March 1st Movement, a nationwide effort among Koreans to protest against Japanese rule over the Korean peninsula. From this experience, Ahn developed a fervor for the Korean independence movement, and began a student-held movement to protest against pro-Japanese teachers; the school deemed Ahn's actions inappropriate, and punished him accordingly. Sometime in September, Ahn involved himself in an effort to raid a jail in order to rescue the March 1 Movement activists caught by the Japanese police. When the police raided one of the meetings, Ahn successfully fled to Dr. Mauri's. The doctor treated Ahn's injuries for a week, and, upon receiving requests from the police to surrender Ahn, made a personal visit to the local police station to discuss alternatives. Impressed with Dr. Mauri's character, the department head let Ahn forego imprisonment by forging papers that permitted Ahn to study music in Tokyo.  Study in Japan  On October 6, 1919, Ahn took a train to Busan and boarded a ship for Shimonoseki. During his stay with his brother Iksam, Ahn succeeded in entering the Tokyo Seisoku Middle School. In 1926, Ahn was accepted to the Kunitachi College of Music. In the summer of that year, Ahn came back to Korea on a music performance trip to gather funds for the reconstruction of a burned down church. There he happened to meet Yi Sangjae, the founder of the Dokrip Newspaper,pp. 31‚Äì32 Baek Sukgi and Jo Mansik, an independence movement leader who advocated the use of Korean-made products so that Koreans' debts might be paid. Upon Jo's request, Ahn led a demonstration promoting the use of Korean commodities by playing his cello in an automobile. In 1928, Ahn's father died, and his mother faced financial difficulty in providing for all five of her sons' education. Therefore, Ahn was hired by a luxurious restaurant as a cellist. Even then, Ahn could not fully pay for his tuition, and the school therefore forbade Ahn to graduate. Furthermore, Ahn accidentally broke his cello, and had to borrow his classmate's. One of Ahn's Japanese peers expressed his respect for Ahn by purchasing him a new Suzuki violin. Eventually, Ahn was able to graduate when his teacher Hansford paid all of Ahn's tuition fees.pp. 41‚Äì42 Baek Sukgi Ahn had a late graduation, which, although for only one person, proceeded as if it were for many. Following his teacher's proposals, Ahn performed a cello concert; at this performance, a Japanese newspaper appraised Ahn as \\"a genius with a bright future\\".p. 43 Baek Sukgi In May 1930, Ahn returned to Korea. Upon his visit to the Soongsil Middle School, Dr. Mauri suggested to Ahn that he continue his studies in the United States. After being prohibited by the Japanese police from holding a concert, Ahn concluded that following Dr. Mauri's advice would be necessary in order to avoid the social barriers placed on the Koreans.pp. 45‚Äì46 Baek Sukgi  United States  Upon arriving in San Francisco, Ahn was jailed during the immigration inspection process, because he refused to hand his cello over to the officials. During the night, Ahn obtained permission from a prison guard to practice on his confiscated cello; unable to make a connection between a musician and a criminal, the prison guard investigated the cause of Ahn's imprisonment and arranged for his release the next day.p. 50 Baek Sukgi7 Back in San Francisco, Ahn went to a Korean church introduced by Dr. Mauri. During a service led by Pastor Hwang, Ahn heard the Korean national anthem, which, at that time, was sung to the tune of the Scottish song, \\"Auld Lang Syne\\". Ahn thought of the tune as unfit for a national anthem, and decided to try composing a new national anthem for Korea.p. 54 Baek Sukgi As Ahn waited in the train station to head toward Cincinnati, Pastor Hwang gave him a black suitcase and a fountain pen with which to write the new national anthem.p. 58 Baek Sukgi As arranged by Pastor Hwang, Ahn met Park Wonjung, Ahn's senior alumnus at the Soongsil Middle School and the Kunitachi Music School, at the train station. Park, then a student at the University of Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music, assisted Ahn in entering the Conservatory. Ahn had to work at a restaurant for low wages in order to make a living, as expected during the Great Depression.p. 59 Baek Sukgi In 1930, Ahn was accepted into the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra as the first cellist, and, during the spring break of his second year, he toured the United States playing recitals in major cities. In New York City, Ahn was allowed to perform in Carnegie Hall, a show that New York newspapers wrote about with positive commentaries. After his successful tour, Ahn changed his career goal from cellist to conductor. In 1935, Ahn transferred to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, graduating in 1936. Around this time, Ahn successfully led a choir in Candem Church; having heard about Ahn and then attending a service at the church, conductor Leopold Stokowski invited him to join the Philadelphia Orchestra.p. 66 Baek Sukgi Unfortunately, Ahn was unable to pay his rent, as he was focused on writing his first orchestral score called Symphonic Fantasy Korea; however, the Peables, Ahn's neighbors, offered to pay his rent for him.p. 70 Baek Sukgi Ahn successfully submitted Symphonic Fantasy Korea to a competition in Carnegie Hall, and Ahn was given the chance to conduct the New York Philharmonic for the work's premiere. However, the performance turned out to be chaotic, as Ahn was unable to control the orchestra. Greatly angered, Ahn threw down his baton. The audience followed with shouts requesting another fresh performance; Ahn refused, expressing his disappointment at the orchestra.p. 72 Baek Sukgi The Peables praised Ahn's actions, and apologized; they also offered to send Ahn to Europe to study and to pay his tuition.  Europe  Budapest's City Park On April 8, 1936, Ahn left New York City, and, upon landing in Europe, headed to Berlin. There he completed Aegukga, the new Korean national anthem, and sent it to a Korean independence movement organization in San Francisco called the \\"Korean People's Meeting\\". He also made final touches to the Symphonic Fantasy Korea.p. 78 Baek Sukgi Ahn moved to Vienna, Austria to study under Bernhard Paumgartner, a famous composer and Beethoven interpreter. In 1937, Ahn went to Hungary to study under Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, applying his teachings specifically to Asian music in composing the Symphonic Fantasy Korea.p. 83 Baek Sukgi In 1937, Ahn was invited to Dublin, Ireland, to perform Symphonic Fantasy Korea. It easily won the Irish audience, as Ireland had been under British rule just as Korea was under the Japanese rule. He then went back to Vienna and met with the famous composer Richard Strauss to discuss his Symphonic Fantasy Korea. At the same time, Ahn was attending the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University on a scholarship from the Hungarian government, and, in 1939, Ahn graduated from the University. Complimenting Ahn on his talent, Strauss appointed Ahn to conduct a concert in Budapest in place of himself. Unfortunately, Ahn had spent so many hours in preparing for the concert that he collapsed during the last piece. Despite this, the Hungarian newspapers praised Ahn for his efforts.p. 90 Baek Sukgi At Strauss's recommendation, the Rome Philharmonic Orchestra gladly accepted Ahn as its conductor; many other orchestras across Europe followed, and Ahn travelled all over Europe to perform. In December 1940, Ahn was invited by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, arguably the world's greatest orchestra at the time.p. 91 Baek Sukgi The German newspapers filled their articles about Ahn with generous praises. Ahn continued to conduct many famous orchestras in Europe. On one occasion, however, Ahn was barred from the Rome Philharmonic Orchestra for performing the Symphonic Fantasy Korea, which the Japanese government had deemed politically displeasing.p. 93 Baek Sukgi Ahn found another place to work, the Orchestre de Paris, but he was forced to leave in 1944, when Paris was liberated from the German forces. He was then invited by the Spanish ambassador to conduct for the Orquestra Simfonica de Barcelona.pp. 94‚Äì95 Baek Sukgi During a social gathering, Ahn was introduced to Lolita Talavera (1915‚Äì2009), who had become a fervent fan of Ahn after seeing a film of one of his performances.p. 96 Baek Sukgi Miss Talavera happened to be knowledgeable about the Japanese occupation of Korea, and Ahn felt understood. The two eventually became engaged, and, on July 5, 1946, Miss Talavera and Ahn were married,p. 97 Baek Sukgi The two went to the island of Majorca, where Ahn founded the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de Mallorca. In the same year, he sought to work in the United States, but his past association with Strauss, who was regarded as tainted by his work with the Nazi regime, obstructed his goal for two years; in the end, however, he was admitted into the Philadelphia Orchestra.  Return to Korea  On August 15, 1948, Ahn's Aegukga was sung during the ceremony commemorating the establishment of the Korean government. After the Korean War, President Syngman Rhee invited Ahn to be part of his 80th birthday celebration, and, on February 19, 1955, Ahn returned to his motherland after 25 years away from home.p. 99 Baek Sukgi The military band played the Aegukga upon Ahn's arrival. Soon after, Ahn was awarded the Cultural Medal of Merit. On invitation from the Tokyo Geijutsu Daigaku, Ahn arrived at the Haneda Airport in January 1960,p. 103 Baek Sukgi and conducted a concert at the Yaon Hibiya Auditorium on the night of February 4. After his success in Tokyo, Ahn flew to Osaka where he held another concert.p. 106 Baek Sukgi After the concert, Ahn urged the Korean population in the area, who had been divided politically between the North and South, to further unity and cooperate.p. 107 Baek Sukgi Later in 1964, Ahn conducted a concert during the 1964 Summer Olympics, as requested by the NHK.pp. 107‚Äì108 Baek Sukgi After a successful concert in Spain, Ahn organized three successive Seoul International Music Festivals,p. 110 Baek Sukgi but could not continue the event any further because it disrupted Ahn's work for the Seoul Philharmonic. On September 16, 1965, Ahn was stricken by a sudden illness and died while staying on the island of Mallorca, where he lived the last 20 years of his life.p. 111 Baek Sukgi On July 8, 1977, Ahn's ashes were transferred from Majorca to the Korean National Cemetery. In 2008, Ahn was included in the list of pro-Japanese collaborators by the Institute for Research in Collaborationist Activities and the Committee for Publication of a Directory of the Biographies of Pro-Japanese Collaborators because he was a conductor at a concert which commemorated the 10th anniversary of Manchukuo.

He served as the head footbball coach at Northern Illinois University from 1985 to 1990 and Oregon State University from 1991 to 1996. compiling a career college football record of . Early life Pettibone's football career started at Jesuit High School in Dallas, Texas. He earned All-State honors as a running back on the state championship football team in 1956 and 1957. He received the honor to be in the first class inducted into the Jesuit Sports Hall of Fame. After graduating from Jesuit High School, Pettibone received a scholarship to the University of Oklahoma in Norman, where he played halfback for the Sooners under head coach Bud Wilkinson. Coaching career =Assistant coach= Pettibone spent time as an assistant coach at the University of Oklahoma, the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, Southern Methodist University (SMU), and Texas A&M; University. In his career as an assistant coach, he coached in 11 major bowl games and won eight Big Eight Conference championships. Teams he was with collectively produced a record of . He was with two national championship teams and helped to recruit 20 consensus All- Americans, two Heisman Trophy winners, two Outland Trophy winners and a Lombardi Award winner. At Oklahoma, Pettibone was part of eight bowl games and was with two national championship teams. He was part of seven Big Eight championship teams at Oklahoma. Pettibone recruited running back Billy Sims, the Heisman Trophy winner in 1978 after rushing for 1,782 yards. One of Pettibone's early Oklahoma classes graduated 17 of 25 players into the National Football League. At Nebraska, he coached in three bowl games. As recruiting coordinator, he helped to recruit consensus All-Americans Irving Fryar, running back Mike Rozier and center Mark Traynowicz. Rozier won the Heisman Trophy in 1983 after rushing for 2,148 yards. At Texas A&M;, Pettibone was named as 'No. 1 Recruiter in America' by Sports Illustrated. Pettibone's initial recruiting class at Texas A&M; ranked first in the Southwest Conference and #5 in the nation. That class produced six Aggie starters the first year. =Head coach= Pettibone's first head coaching position was in 1985 at Northern Illinois University in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) and he led the Huskies for six seasons, the last five as an independent. Northern Illinois recorded a 9‚Äì2 record in 1989 to tie the best-ever record in history of the school. Pettibone was named Coach of the Year for major northern independent schools by Sporting News. NIU established four school records (most points, most touchdowns, most rushing touchdowns and most possession time) and the Huskies were ranked among the top 25 in five different categories. Northern Illinois recorded its first-ever victory over a ranked team (top 25) in 1990 when it routed #24 Fresno State 73‚Äì18 on October 6 in DeKalb. Northern Illinois also established 51 school records and seven NCAA records during Pettibone's final three years. With the Huskies, he posted a record. After the 1990 season, Pettibone left NIU in early December for the Pacific-10 Conference at Oregon State University in Corvallis, replacing Dave Kragthorpe. The contrasting styles of offenses made the transition very difficult; Kragthorpe ran an extremely pass oriented offense, while Pettibone preferred the running game and specifically the wishbone formation and the triple option. In his first two seasons at Oregon State, the team struggled, winning only one game in both 1991 and 1992. However, in 1993 and 1994, things started to click and the Beavers posted four wins each year. Oregon State finished second in the nation in rushing in 1993, and Pettibone was named co- runner-up for the Division I-A Coach of the Year honors by Sports Illustrated. In his fifth season in 1995, they fell to 1‚Äì10; after a 2‚Äì9 season in 1996, Pettibone resigned in late November, and was succeeded by Mike Riley in 1997. Later life and family Pettibone left Corvallis to become the assistant athletic director at his alma mater Oklahoma in 1996. After one year, his position was terminated in the wake of budget cuts in the department. Pettibone lives in Norman with his wife Susy and currently works for Sooners Helping Sooners, a non-profit that helps former OU student athletes find employment.

It is the first installment in the Medal of Honor video game series. The story was created by film director and producer Steven Spielberg. Gameplay In Medal of Honor, the player takes the role of the fictional Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson, a former C-47 Skytrain pilot in the Air Transport Command who was later recruited to the OSS. The game takes place near the end of World War II (mid 1944-mid 1945). The goal of the game is to complete various Office of Strategic Services (OSS) missions, such as rescuing an American pilot, going undercover to board and destroy a U-boat, recovering stolen art work, and sabotaging the Nazi war effort. The game includes a split screen deathmatch mode, pitting two players against each other in various maps. Players can unlock several secret characters after completing the game or through cheat codes, including notable historical figures such as Filipino patriot Jos√© Rizal and playwright William Shakespeare, as well as outlandish characters such as a German Shepherd and a dinosaur. Development Development of the game started on November 11, 1997. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg held a meeting with DreamWorks Interactive staff, outlining an idea for a video game, a first-person shooter set during World War II. The idea originated from the experience his son Max had from playing the game GoldenEye 007 and Spielberg's deep interest in World War II. The game was written and produced by Peter Hirschmann. Dale Dye served as the game's military advisor. Spielberg had previously worked with Dye on the film Saving Private Ryan. By March 1998, the game had reached its prototype stage with significant differences from the original version in the works. When the game reached its finishing stage in November 1999, there was an angry letter sent from Medal of Honor recipient Paul Bucha who rejected the release of such a game, claiming it was a dishonorable project. Peter Hirschmann showed Bucha a demonstration and gave a talk, saving the project from cancellation altogether. Original animation tests for enemies took place around December 1997. Enemies were structured with up to 250 polygons. Blood and gruesome deaths were excluded from the game due to the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. Music Medal of Honor Original Soundtrack Recording is the soundtrack album for the game and was composed by film composer Michael Giacchino. Giacchino explained that in Medal of Honor, Jimmy Patterson was represented by two different major musical themes - the main Medal of Honor theme, and his own more personal theme which was used during the tougher moments of his journey.\\"As quoted in Gary Huff, \\"Interview with Michael Giacchino,\\" Soundtrack Review Central. The music was recorded by a full orchestra.http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/11/19/medal-of- honor Most of the tracks were reproduced on a new CD for the 10th anniversary edition box-set, with the exception of the last two tracks. Reception Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"The best PlayStation first- person shooter in ages, Medal of Honor proves that few things are more satisfying than shooting a Nazi in the face.\\" Medal of Honor received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The game received \\"critical acclaim\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. This was due to critics praising its gameplay, graphics, enemy AI, level design and soundtrack. GamePro gave the game high regards saying \\"This WWII Shooter features some of the most tense first-person action ever delivered on the Playstation\\". They also said \\"Without question, [Medal of Honor]'s stellar soldiering makes it one of the year's top titles and must-own game\\". PSM stated that the game was \\"An extraordinary game with no equal on the PlayStation\\". In the final issue of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine, the game was chosen as the 8th best game of all time. IGN ranked the game #21 on their list of the \\"Top 25 Games of All Time\\" for the PlayStation console. Sequel Medal of Honor is the first in the Medal of Honor series and was followed by the direct sequel Medal of Honor: Underground.

He was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey. Known for his Pan- African Afrocentrist views that the role of African people in history and the accomplishments of African Americans are far more important than commonly held, Jeffries has urged that public school syllabi be made less Euro-centric. His claims that Jewish businessmen financed the Atlantic slave trade and used the movie industry to hurt black people, and that whites are \\"ice people\\" while Africans are \\"sun people,\\" received national publicity in the early 1990s. Jeffries was discharged from his position as chairman of the Black Studies Department at CUNY, leading to a lengthy legal battle, ending in the courts supporting the college's right to remove him from the position due to his incendiary remarks.Richard Perez-Pena, \\"In Reversal, Court Backs City College In Jeffries Lawsuit\\". The New York Times, April 5, 1995 Jeffries' nephew, Hakeem Jeffries, has served in the US House of Representatives from the state of New York.  Academic career  Jeffries attended Lafayette College for his undergraduate work. While in Lafayette, Jeffries pledged, and was accepted into, Pi Lambda Phi, a fraternity with a large number of Jewish members. In his senior year, Jeffries was elected president of the fraternity. After graduating with honors in 1959, Jeffries won a Rotary International fellowship to the University of Lausanne in Switzerland and then returned in 1961 to study at Columbia University's School of International Affairs, from which he received a master's degree in 1965. At the same time, Jeffries worked for Operation Crossroads Africa, allowing him to spend time in Guinea, Mali, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast. He became the program coordinator for West Africa in 1965. Jeffries became a political science instructor at City College of New York (CCNY) in 1969 and received his doctorate from Columbia University in 1971 with a dissertation on politics in the Ivory Coast. He became the founding Chairman of Black Studies at San Jose State College in California. A year later, he became a tenured professor at CCNY and became the chairman of the new Black Studies Department. He held the position of Chairman of CCNY's Black Studies Department for over two decades, recruiting like-minded scholars and attempting to expand the number of faculty and students within or associated with the department. In 1972, he was recruited by City College of New York to organize its Black Studies Department. During his tenure, the department sponsored/hosted/organized 25 major national and international conferences and seminars. Besides administration and teaching, he often travelled to Africa and served in the African Heritage Studies Association, a group seeking to define and develop the Black Studies discipline. Jeffries was a speaker at college campuses and in public. He is known for his Pan-African Afrocentrist viewsthat the role of African people in history and his opinion that the accomplishments of African Americans are far more important than commonly held. Jeffries had also advanced a theory that whites are \\"ice people\\" who are violent and cruel, while blacks are \\"sun people\\" who are compassionate and peaceful. He is a proponent of melanin theory and claims that melanin levels affect the psyche of people, and that melanin allows black people to \\"negotiate the vibrations of the universe and to deal with the ultraviolet rays of the sun.\\" = 1991 speech = On July 20, 1991, Jeffries gave a controversial speech at the Empire State Black Arts and Cultural Festival, in Albany, New York. During the two-hour speech, he said that \\"rich Jews\\" financed the slave trade and control the film industry together with Italian mafia, using it to paint a brutal stereotype of blacks.  Removal as chairman and legal battles (1990s) In 1992, Jeffries first got his term shortened from three years to one, and was then removed as chairman from the department of African-American studies, but was allowed to stay as a professor. Jeffries sued the school and in August 1993 a federal jury found that his First Amendment rights had been violated. However, Jeffries had been unanimously reappointed as chairman. He was restored as chairman and awarded $400,000 in damages (later reduced to $360,000). The school appealed, but the federal appeals court upheld the verdict while removing the damages. The CUNY Institute for Research on the Diaspora in the Americas and Caribbean was created to do black research independent of Jeffries' department. It was headed by Edmund W. Gordon, who had led the Black Studies Department before Jeffries was reinstated. In November 1994, the Supreme Court told the appeals court to reconsider after a related Supreme Court decision.Waters v. Churchill (114 S.Ct. 1878 [1994]), The appeals court reversed its decision in April 1995,Jeffries v. Harleston, 52 F.3d 9 [2nd Cir. 1995] and in June the same year Prof. Moyibi Amodo was elected to succeed Jeffries as department chairman. = Academic freedom debate = The Jeffries case led to debate about tenure, academic freedom and free speech. He was sometimes compared to Michael Levin, a CUNY professor who outside of the classroom claimed that black people are inferior, and had recently won against the school in court. One interpretation of the Jeffries case is that while a university cannot fire a professor for opinions and speech, they have more flexibility with a position like department chair. Another is that it allows public institutions to discipline employees in general for disruptive speech.

As the name implies, they are bright yellow in color, save for a whitish patch on each cheek. Description G. okinawae have a generally fusiform shape with seven dorsal spines, ten soft dorsal rays, one anal spine, and nine anal soft rays. At maturity they can reach a length of 3.5 cm.Gobiodon okinawae, Fishbase.org, retrieved 4 November 2007 Another species, Gobiodon citrinus, the citrus goby, has a similar appearance to Gobiodon okinawae. G. okinawae, however, lacks the requisite blue and white facial markings of G. citrinus. These fish are not generally aggressive, though they can actively protect their territory against their own kind. Their primary defense against predators is a poisonous, bitter mucus on their skin that makes them unpalatable.\\"Fish Tales - Let's clown around with more Gobies - the Gobiodon species\\", Henry C. Shultz III, Reefkeeping Magazine, October 2002, retrieved 4 November 2007 Habitat Yellow Clown Goby. The yellow clown goby inhabits the coral reefs of sheltered lagoons. Unlike most gobies, which are burrowers, Gobiodon sp. roost in the outer branches of Acropora (staghorn) corals, in groups of five to fifteen individuals. Diet Most gobies are carnivores, and the yellow clown goby is further subcategorized as a planktivore. Given their small size, their diet consists mainly of mesoplankton. They are opportunistic feeders, not hunters. The typical eating behavior is to wait for food to come into range, at which point they dart out to grab it and then immediately return to their roost. In the aquarium The yellow clown goby is popular with aquarists and is generally considered to be reef safe. It is especially suited to nano reef tanks because of its small size, and the ability of the aquarist to closely monitor its health. Equally bright as their coloration is their personality; they are valued additions to reef aquaria, with a reputation for being friendly and entertaining. Because of territorial issues with their own kind in the small confines of a tank, they are best kept singly or as a breeding pair. Given host corals in which to \\"roost\\", these fish are a colorful and entertaining addition to reef tanks. Many gobies become accustomed to their keepers, recognize their presence, and seem to beg for food. Additionally, when perching in a favorite location, they seem to do a \\"fish dance\\" where they wiggle back and forth in an undulating motion while waving their fins. Many of these fish arrive at retailers in emaciated condition and are slow or finicky eaters. They often starve in the presence of more voracious feeders, such as wrasses. Care must be taken to ensure they start eating within one or two days of acquisition. They are carnivorous and initially do not readily take flake or pellet foods, instead preferring live or frozen. Suggested foods include live brine shrimp fortified with phytoplankton to boost nutritional value, Zooplankton, frozen or live mysis shrimp, and finely chopped silversides (a commonly available small fish sold fresh or frozen). This animal, like many other marine species, requires a varied diet to survive in long term captivity. Regular feeding of at least four kinds of foods is recommended. Conservation status The yellow clown goby is not found on the IUCN Red List. The species is highly resilient, with localized populations able to double within fifteen months. Reproduction Gobiodon sp. start life as females, and are bi-directional protogynous hermaphrodites, meaning that when paired up, if they are both of the same sex, one changes sex to form a breeding pair. In the case of two females forming a pair, the larger of the two becomes male, and in the case of two males, the smaller changes sex to become female. The only time a male is smaller than a female is when a small male is placed in the same coral as a large female. The eggs are laid in circular bands around coral branches in masses of up to a thousand. The male will immediately fertilize them and guard until hatching, about five days later. At about day 33, the fry undergo metamorphosis and begin to settle. Coloration can be seen at about day 40.

Created by artist and writer Barry Windsor-Smith, he first appeared in the 1993 flipbook issue Archer and Armstrong #8/Eternal Warrior #8. He was then further developed in his own series Timewalker, which lasted 15 issues and also had a special #0 issue detailing his childhood. Like his younger brothers Aram (also called Armstrong) and Gilad the Eternal Warrior, Ivar has immortality and enhanced physical traits, and is nearly invulnerable to injury. Since the 2012 Valiant Universe reboot, Gilad also has an immortal sister: Vexana the War-Monger. Unlike his siblings, Ivar regularly travels through time by journeying through naturally occurring \\"time arcs,\\" though he cannot control his destination without a highly advanced tachyon compass. As a man leading a non-linear life, and whose adventures sometimes overlap each other, Ivar is a cunning opportunist who will often manipulate others, friend or enemy, for his plans against evil to succeed. Publishing History Originally, there were meant to be two immortal brothers in the Valiant Comics Universe - Gilad, the Eternal Warrior and Aram the other, better known as Armstrong. Each is older than recorded history although Gilad is the elder by two years. In Archer & Armstrong/Eternal Warrior #8 (a double-sized \\"flipbook\\" that was two issues in one), readers learned there was a third brother, Ivar the eldest. Ivar then starred in Timewalker, which ran for 15 issues. An extra origin issue, numbered #0, detailed his origin and childhood, showed his father Vandal, and explained why he was not present when his younger brothers Aram and Gilad were adults and discovered their own immortality. Acclaim Entertainment bought Valiant comics in 1994, leading to a reboot of the Valiant characters. In 1997, the graphic novel series Eternal Warriors reintroduced Ivar and his two brothers as Vikings, the sons of Mog and Nin, who become immortal due to a special plant. Collectively called the \\"Eternal Warriors,\\" the three brothers fight evil together and share immortality with others over the centuries, creating the \\"Forever Family.\\" The series started with the 1997 graphic novel Eternal Warriors: Time and Treachery by writer Art Holcomb and artists Doug Wheatley and John Floyd. The series ended in 1998 after five more graphic novels. In chronological order, they were: Eternal Warriors: Digital Alchemy, Eternal Warriors: Archer & Armstong, Eternal Warriors: Blackworks, Eternal Warriors: Mog, and Eternal Warriors: The Immortal Enemy. Acclaim Entertainment declared bankruptcy in 2007 and the newly created Valiant Entertainment, Inc. bought back the rights to many characters. Valiant Comics was relaunched in 2012 with a rebooted universe. Ivar was reintroduced in 2012 in the first story arc of Archer & Armstrong Volume 2 by writer Fred Van Lente and artists Clayton Henry and Brian Reber. Archer & Armstrong #0 later revealed that the three brothers gained immortality when Ivar activated a strange machine known as the Boon, a device that gave them this gift by draining the life force from their entire home city-state and destroying the surrounding area. The same incident also temporarily removed Ivar from physical reality, turning him into a timewalker. In 2015, Ivar was the title star of the 12-issue series Ivar, Timewalker by Fred Van Lente with art by Clayton Henry and Brian Reber. Fictional character biography =Valiant Comics 1992-1996= Born in a village of Anatolia over 3000 years before the celebrated birth of Jesus Christ, Ivar Anni-Padda is the son of Vandal, a fierce warrior. After his mother dies while giving birth to Vandal's youngest son, Aram, the boy Ivar flees the village in grief. While away, he learns he can sense folds in time or \\"time arcs\\" and then comes across a group of aliens and a woman named Jahk'rt, who is a \\"bio-manipulator\\" and a time traveler from the far future. Ivar returns to the village to warn them of the strange threats but finds it has already been raided and destroyed by other enemies, though Vandal and his two other sons escaped. Jahk'rt, sensing Ivar is special, then captures the boy and studies him for over a century, during which it is realized he stops aging during his adulthood and is nearly invulnerable to death. This last trait allows him to travel through time arcs safely without a vehicle, though he cannot control his destination.Timewalker #0. While Ivar is gone, his two younger brothers Gilad and Aram learn they are also enhanced and have immortality. Freeing himself, Ivar runs across another prisoner, a young woman, and helps her escape. They fall in love but when Ivar takes them through a time arc to evade capture, she is killed by the stress of the journey. With a time compass he took from Jahk'rt, Ivar begins his long life as a \\"Timewalker,\\" journeying back and forth through time, having many adventures and fighting many threats against humanity. He learns many languages, studies several fields, and becomes adept at a wide variety of weapons and fighting styles.Timewalker #0, 1-2. On occasions, he reunited with his brother Gilad, now the ruthless Eternal Warrior, and Aram, the jovial adventurer who later calls himself Armstrong. A few exploits of the three brothers even inspire the tales of The Three Musketeers.Eternal Warrior Volume 1 #8 (1992). Archer and Armstrong #8-11 (1992). Ivar also sometimes runs into various Geomancers, a long line of sorcerers who speak directly to the Earth and sometimes recruit heroes to help them against great evil. During his travels, Ivar winds up in the middle of the future-era Harbinger Wars, bringing him into contact with the woman Faith Herbert and the last of the Rai warriors.Timewalker #6-8. Rai #0. =Acclaim Entertainment 1997-1998= Long ago, the Viking warrior Mog has a wife Nin (a woman with one green eye and one brown eye) and three sons: Gilad, Ivar and Aram. Mog discovers a special herb he believes is connected to the gods. Calling it the Bloom, Mog shares it with their young sons, who begin growing rapidly and show increased physical abilities. Consuming the plant regularly, Mog gains a form of immortality and begins to hear voices he thinks are gods telling him it is his destiny to dominate Earth. When Nin shows concern for him, Mog decides she is jealous of his power and stabs her fatally. To save his mother, Ivar pushes her into the river where the Bloom plant was found. Mog destroys his village in a rage, then continues pursuing murder and conquest over the centuries. Eventually, he gains enough control over his rage to act clandestinely when he must. Nin, transformed by the Bloom, repeatedly confronts Mog, becoming his Immortal Enemy.Eternal Warriors: The Immortal Enemy (1998) Reaching adulthood, Mog's sons realize they are ageless and nearly invulnerable. Working against threats to humanity, they become known as the Eternal Warriors. As the centuries go on, the three Eternal Warriors occasionally choose those they deem worthy to become immortal as well, sharing the Bloom with them. Those chosen become known as the Forever Family, and together they and mortal allies work in secret to fight evil and influence humanity for the better.Eternal Warriors: Archer & Armstrong (1997) Many of the Forever Family leave their old names behind, renaming themselves after weapons or items of significance. The three Eternal Warriors also earn individual titles among the Forever Family. Aram, also nicknamed \\"the Mighty Arm-Strong,\\" becomes an Earth-based sorcerer known as a Geomancer. Gilad becomes known as Warmaster. Ivar, who discovers how to fold time and travel through the sub-dimension of \\"netherspace,\\" earns the title Timewalker. With his \\"fold maps,\\" Ivar and the Forever Family can teleport across Earth through netherspace portals. With a wrist-worn device, Ivar is able to control and navigate his journeys through time, though the device proves inaccurate at ties (such as taking him to a Led Zeppelin concert rather than to a literal zeppelin). In 1933 Berlin, Ivar is present when his mother Nin nearly kills his father Mog but is seriously injured herself. Unable to allow either parent to die but considering them both too dangerous to leave alone, Ivar traps Mog in a glacier and then imprisons Nin inside a place where magic spells prevent her from fully healing. It is decades before either is released.Eternal Warriors: The Immortal Enemy (1998) In the modern- day, the Eternal Warriors have a hidden community in the Palazzo base in Rome that includes the Forever Family, several human allies, and the Neo-Vals, the last surviving descendants of the original Vikings. The Forever Family works together again against threats such as the corrupt organization Blackworks, whose leader Donald Kelvin discovers Mog. The father of the Eternal Warriors uses Blackworks resources to wage war, demanding leadership of the Forever Family and domination of Earth. To fight Mog, Ivar frees his imprisoned mother Nin. After several battles, Mog is defeated and the Eternal Warriors decide their efforts to help humanity have caused as much harm as good. They disband the Forever Family and go their separate ways.Eternal Warriors: The Immortal Enemy (1998) The Acclaim version of Ivar the Timewalker is also featured in a two-issue team-up mini-series alongside the time-lost hero Turok. The two confront the villain Sabbath with the help of Master Darque.Turok, Timewalker: Seventh Sabbath #1-2 (August‚ÄìSeptember 1997) = Valiant Entertainment Reboot 2012 = Six thousand years ago in the ancient Mesopotamian city-state of Ur, Ivar Anni-Prada is a normal man and the eldest of four children.

One day, he and his brothers Aram and Gilad (the youngest) journey into the strange realm of Utnapishtim, also called \\"the Faraway.\\" During their quest, they meet the Keepers of the Timeless Word, an order that safeguards a machine known as the Boon which sustains life in the Faraway, keeping it a timeless place without death. They take the machine but Gilad is fatally wounded. Ivar and Aram return to Ur and their young sister Vexana is grief- stricken, leaving Gilad's deathbed and fleeing the city. Ivar blames himself for Gilad's death and determines to use the Boon to restore Gilad, despite Aram's protests. Activated, the Boon drains the life force from the thousands who inhabit Ur and a massive explosion occurs, the Great Cataclysm. All those in Ur and the surrounding areas are killed, the city now in ruins. As a result, Gilad is not only resurrected, he and his two brothers are now immortals with enhanced bodies and minds.Archer & Armstrong Volume 2 #0 The blast of the Great Cataclysm imprisons Ivar outside of physical reality, forcing him to walk through time. His two brothers eventually go their separate ways, with Aram later adopting the name Armstrong and Gilad becoming known as the Eternal Warrior, chosen by Earth itself to stop certain threats by any means necessary, often working with Geomancers who speak for the Earth. Unable to act directly in the physical world, Ivar eventually reaches out telepathically to the young warrior Obadiah Archer, who befriends Armstrong in the 21st century. Ivar helps guide the two of them to prevent an evil cult known as the Sect from reactivating the Boon.Archer & Armstrong Volume 2 #1-4. Finally free of his imprisonment, Ivar can now walk through time via \\"time arcs\\" that naturally occur. Rather than simply pursuing a linear life, he regularly hops between different time eras, navigating with a \\"tachyon compass\\", while doing his best to protect Earth and sometimes even reality itself from evil and destruction. Known as a Timewalker, or to some time travelers as the \\"Forever Walker,\\" Ivar works alongside many heroes and warriors in his adventures, occasionally recruiting his brothers as well. Due to the nature of his journeys, he often meets people out of linear order.Ivar, Timewalker #1-6 Vexana is also killed by the blast but then resurrected by dark spirits that grant her immortality and the ability to warp emotions. Seeing her home destroyed, Vexana worries her survival means she might be responsible for the Great Cataclysm. She leaves, her grief blocking out much of her memory and warping her mind. She becomes the War-Monger, a self-styled \\"agent of chaos\\" sparking conflicts around the world. In the modern-day, Ivar encounters Dr. Neela Sethi just before the woman is about to invent time travel on Earth. He guides her on a journey through time so she can understand the nature of time travel, though secretly pursuing his own agenda. To aid him against the Null, a cult worshiping oblivion and hoping to erase the physical universe, Ivar recruits Sethi, Armstong, Amelia Earhart, and an older version of Gilad from the far future. After the threat of the Null is seemingly defeated, Ivar and Sethi go separate ways, apparently down different timelines.Ivar, Timewalker #1-12  Superhuman Abilities  Like his brothers Aram and Gilad, Ivar Anni-Pada is ageless, invulnerable to disease and poison. He has superhuman strength, is more resistant to injury than an average human, has enhanced reflexes and speed, and his body heals from injury and damage. In the Acclaim Entertainment Comics continuity, immortals could still be killed by catastrophic injury, such as having most of their flesh and muscle destroyed, having their heads destroyed, or being bisected across the mid- section. His long life and unique experiences as a Timewalker have made him an expert at various forms of combat and highly knowledgable in several fields. Since 2012, the comics have said that mysterious machine known as the Boon not only made Ivar and his brothers immortal and enhanced their bodies but also enhanced their mind. The three brothers now have minds with unlimited storage and analytical capacity, as well as perfect recall when necessary. Even if the brain is destroyed and must later regenerate, all memories and knowledge are retained. The Boon also equips the mind with a unique form of apathy, so that emotions do not play a prominent role in their thought processes (although they do still feel them). This makes them immune to depression and other forms of mental illness, allowing them to experience eternity without losing their sanity over time. Along with his immortality, Ivar can sense use naturally occurring folds and disruptions in time called \\"time arcs.\\" He can then walk through these folds, instantly transporting himself to another time and place (though usually limited to Earth). Ivar cannot navigate his time travel without technology such as a tachyon compass. Since the 2012 Valiant Entertainment Reboot, Ivar wears a chip called a \\"zelig\\" that acts as a universal translator and causes others to see his appearance, skin tone, and clothing as what they could expect from an average and non-threatening inhabitant of their local time and area. Having a zelig means he can see through the disguise of someone else's zelig.

He served as the head coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1967‚Äì1977), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (1978‚Äì1986), and Wake Forest University (1987‚Äì1992), compiling a career college football record of 162‚Äì126‚Äì5. Early life and family Dooley was born in 1934, in Mobile, Alabama. There, he attended the McGill Institute, administered by the Brothers of the Sacred Heart. Dooley then attended Perkinston Junior College in Perkinston, Mississippi from 1952 to 1953. In 1953, he moved on to Mississippi State University and graduated in 1956, where he was an all-SEC lineman for the Maroons/Bulldogs. Dooley's brother is former University of Georgia head football coach Vince Dooley, and the two went against each other's teams in the 1971 Gator Bowl. His nephew, Derek Dooley is the former head football coach at the University of Tennessee. He resided in Wilmington, North Carolina. Dooley was married to Marie Dooley. He has four sons; Jim Dooley and Billy Dooley from his first marriage to Chris Dooley and Sean Dooley and Ashton Dooley, M.S. from his second marriage to Marie Dooley. Coaching and administrative career With the North Carolina Tar Heels, Dooley won three Atlantic Coast Conference titles, including the school's first outright conference championship in 1971. As a result, Dooley has the most Atlantic Coast Conference titles of any North Carolina Tar Heels football coach. He left North Carolina as the winningest coach in school history, since surpassed by Dick Crum and Mack Brown. Dooley is still the school's longest consecutively tenured head coach and second longest tenured coach overall. He also achieved the school's first 11-win season in 1972. Only three other Tar Heel teams have ever won 11 games. After his tenure at North Carolina, Dooley served as the athletic director and head football coach at Virginia Tech. He led the Hokies to three bowl games‚Äîas many as they had attended in their entire history prior to his arrival. His best team was the 1986 unit, which went 9‚Äì2‚Äì1 and won the Peach Bowl. That team was later awarded a 10th win after Temple forfeited its entire 1986 schedule‚Äîincluding a 29-13 win over the Hokies‚Äîdue to an ineligible player.http://articles.sun- sentinel.com/1988-07-26/sports/8802130506_1_paul-palmer-western-michigan- temple Thus Dooley \\"officially\\" owns Virginia Tech's first-ever 10-win season. Tom Harper (left) His tenure at Virginia Tech, however, ended shortly afterward amidst allegations of NCAA recruiting violations. After resigning from his positions at Virginia Tech, he sued the university for $3,500,000 alleging breach of contract. The lawsuit was settled out of court. At the time, he was the winningest coach in school history, though he has since been surpassed by his successor, Frank Beamer. Finally, Dooley served as the head coach at Wake Forest where, , he is third in the football program's history for all-time wins and tied for fourth in longest tenure. Furthermore, he is tied with Paul Amen for the most Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year awards in school history (2). Awards and honors Dooley was inducted in the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame in 1993, North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 1995, and the Greater Wilmington Sports Hall of Fame in 2011. The NFFCHOF Bill Dooley Chapter, located in the Raleigh-Durham area, was established in 1995 and is named in Dooley's honor.

MacDonald) (born October 4, 1958 in Wausau, Wisconsin) is an American singer-songwriter based in Austin, Texas. In the 1980s, she, her then-husband Pat MacDonald, and a beat box formed the recording act Timbuk3 whose 1986 signature song was \\"The Future's So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades\\". The duo did road work with Bob Dylan, Sting, and Jackson Browne. They once appeared on Saturday Night Live and were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1987. After divorcing MacDonald in 1995, Kooyman remained in Austin, raising the couple's son, taking the name Barbara K, and pursuing a solo career. She became entrenched in the city's rich musical community and recorded three solo albums, two of which featured her original songs and one filled with her own interpretations of the songs of Timbuk3 (all three albums released on her own label Sparrows Wheel). As an independent recording artist, Kooyman saw a need in the music industry for strengthening alliances between artists and media outlets. She and co-founders Wolfgang Pracht and Ben Bright conceived and created Artists For Media Diversity, or A4MD. The 501(c)(3) charitable organization was formed to protect freedom of speech through the funding of services for alternative non-commercial media sources, to foster independent media voices, and to promote musical and cultural diversity. One of the projects the organization has underway for empowering independent artists and community radio stations is a live music archive that artists and stations can contribute live performance tracks and from which other stations can access recordings for their own broadcast purposes. Kooyman's work, both musical and organizational, is rooted in social activism and responsibility. After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, Barbara K and Wolfgang Pracht wrote a reflection on the ominous environmental implications of such a disaster: \\"Swimming In Blackwater.\\" The video features Kooyman and her frequent musical collaborator Richard Bowden.

When Carl Faberg√© took over the running of the business in 1882, its output increased so rapidly that the two Faberg√© brothers could not manage all the workshops themselves. They therefore decided to establish independent workshops. The owners of these were committed to only work for the House of Faberg√© that would supply the sketches and models of the objects to be made. Nothing would be accepted by the House unless it had been approved by either Carl or his appointed deputy. The House of Faberg√© also employed its own designers. However we also know from the Memoirs of Fran√ßois Birbaum written in 1919 (Birbaum was Head Designer of the House of Faberg√© from 1896 to 1917) that Carl also designed himself. The workmasters presided over teams of craftsmen and were responsible for executing pieces conceived by the company's designers. The House of Faberg√© was staffed with some of the finest goldsmiths and jewelers available. It is often said that Faberg√© did not make anything produced by the House of Faberg√©. It is true that nothing has survived that can be said to have been the work of Carl Faberg√©. His father, Gustav Faberg√© and the founder of the House of Faberg√©, ensured that his eldest son received the best possible training to take over the business. After Carl‚Äôs education in St. Petersburg, this was followed by a course at the Arts and Crafts School in Dresden, the city to which his parents had retired. He then embarked on an eight-year Grand Tour of Europe where he received tuition from respected goldsmiths in Germany, France and England. The ‚Äòapprenticeship‚Äô with these goldsmiths would have resulted in Carl working at the bench and producing objects. When Carl returned to the House of Faberg√© in St. Petersburg during 1872 his father‚Äôs trusted workmaster Finnish-born Hiskias Pendin acted as his mentor and tutor. This would also have involved Carl working at the bench and producing objects. When he was awarded the title Master Goldsmith in 1882, his reputation was then so high that the usual three-day examination was waived; this would not have happened if he had never made anything. The business was divided into several workshops, each with its own specialty. In addition to the fabulous easter eggs, the workshop also produced table silver, jewelry, European-style trinkets, and Russian-style carvings. The two master jewelers most responsible for making the Faberg√© eggs were Michael Perchin and Finnish-born Henrik Wigstr√∂m. Born in 1860, Perchin became the leading workmaster in the House of Faberg√© in 1886 and supervised production of the eggs until 1903. Those eggs he was responsible for have his MP (MP- Michael Perchin) markings. All signed eggs made after 1903 bear Henrik Wigstr√∂m's HW mark. Of course, not all eggs were stamped, so other goldsmiths may have supervised production of some of the eggs. Altogether there have been more than 40 workmasters.  List of Faberg√© workmasters  (The list is not complete.) *1st Silver- Artel (1896-1917). Faberg√© commissioned many silver articles from the 1st Silver- Artel.

He was responsible for the crafting of the imperial Easter eggs from 1885 or 1886 until his death in 1903. His hallmark appears on all but the first egg made during those years. Although he was initially trained by rural craftsmen and by the leading workmaster Erik Kollin, Perchin's mature work recalls elements of the rococo and Louis XV styles. His hallmarks: 'M.P.' in Russian Cyrillic. *Pihl, Alma (1888 Moscow ‚Äì 1976 Helsinki), the other of the two female designers and one of the best known Finnish designer/workmaster who worked for Faberg√©.

She designed the famous Winter Easter Egg in 1913 and Mosaic Easter Egg in 1914, which now belongs to the collection of H. M. the Queen Elizabeth of Great Britain, and also many pieces of fine jewellery of which the most famous is a collection of snowflake jewellery. *Pihl, Oskar W. (1890 Moscow ‚Äì 1957 Helsinki), one of the Finnish head workmasters at The House of Faberg√©, brother of Alma Pihl, grandson of August Holmstr√∂m. Made small items of jewellery such as tie pin.

It functioned from at least 1951 until 1990, when the Belgian branch was promptly and officially dissolved after its existence became publicly known following revelations concerning the Italian branch of the stay-behind network.  History  The history of the Belgian branch of the Gladio network starts in 1948 when Prime Minister Paul-Henri Spaak and Minister of Justice Paul Struye gave the Staatsveiligheid (State Security Service) permission to discuss with allied intelligence services the organization of a clandestine stay-behind network. These negotiations mainly happened with Sir Stewart Menzies of the British SIS and representatives of the then freshly founded CIA. The explicit objectives of this collaboration were outlined in a top-secret letter from Menzies to Spaak: The amount of influence at this early stage, accredited to the CIA varies from source to source. CIA did not yet have full authority over the Office of Policy Coordination, which directed U.S. covert action until 1952. During the initial negotiations Menzies proposed to keep the US out of the organization, but Spaak objected to further developments not being in a tripartite (Belgium-Great-Britain-United States) or multilateral setting. In the final report of the parliamentary inquiry there is little mention of CIA involvement, but investigative journalist Walter de Bock points, based on Pentagon documents, at the CIA's significant early organizational role and de facto control until 1968.11/12/13-06-1991, De Morgen Similarly, Colonel Margot complains in an internal note, dated April 8, 1959, about the influence of the US intelligence services on the Belgian branch of the Gladio-network. These initial negotiations led to closer collaboration between the three countries' secret services under the name Tripartite Meeting Belgium. Following this meeting, the Belgian stay-behind network became operational, but it was not until January 4, 1952 that the first formal instructions for stay-behind operations were issued to Ludovicus Caeymaex (Staatsveiligheid) and General Etienne Baele.Gijsels (1991), p. 69. Growing polarization between East and West and awareness of the need for continental collaboration led to the foundation in 1949 of the Comit√© Clandestin de l'Union Occidentale (C.C.U.O.), which contained Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France and Great- Britain. The C.C.U.O. laid the base for the formation of the NATO and coordinated the various stay-behind networks in the five member countries.Gijsels, pg. 68 Its functions were transferred to the Clandestine Planning Committee (C.P.C.), another NATO-organization in 1951, which was renamed in to Coordination and Planning Committee in 1959.Parlementaire Commissie (1991), p. 20. The C.P.C. elaborated a plan for installing two taskgroups, one for communications and one for secret networks, a structure reflected in the Allied Coordination Committee (A.C.C.) founded in 1958 to relieve the C.P.C. of some of its tasks. The A.C.C. consisted of the members of the C.C.U.O. plus the US and coordinated the stay-behind activities, as was stipulated on its first meeting in April 1959 under French supervision: These interlocking coordination organizations, like the C.P.C. and A.C.C, were initially headquartered in Paris, but moved along with SHAPE, NATO's central headquarters, to Mons in Belgium after the French withdrawal from NATO's unified command structure in 1966. After the initial six counties, Germany, Italy, Denmark and Norway became members of the A.C.C.. Though all of the counties were members of NATO, an official link between the A.C.C and NATO was denied. The parliamentary committee noted \\"... one can not do away with the impression that in practice closer and closer relations did come to exist\\".Parlementaire Commissie (1991), p. 21 In the following decades the stay-behind activities were mainly coordinated through A.C.C.-meetings. These activities consisted officially of (multinational) training activities like infiltration, parachute jumping and long range communications, of which numerous were held at least between 1972 and 1989.Gijsels (1991), pg. 71 Due to the secretive nature of the network, the milieu of various operatives involved and the Cold War setting, allegations were raised that the stay- behind network was during this time also at least indirect involved with clandestine actions on Belgian soil. The last documented meeting of the A.C.C took place on 23 and 24 October 1990 under supervision of General Van Calster, where the participants discussed a.o. a scaling-back of the stay-behind network in light of changing international relations. This was the meeting Andreotti was referring to following the October 24, 1990 revelation of the existence of Gladio in Italy, a revelations several others governments' spokespersons reacted to by claiming that any stay-behind in their own country was history. This only exasperated Andreotti, who declared to the press that the last stay-behind meeting had taken place in Belgium a few days ago. After the exposure of the Italian branch and inquiries by Italian officials to their Belgian counterparts, Defense minister Guy Co√´me and Prime Minister Wilfried Martens made the existence of the Belgian section of the Gladio-network public in a press meeting on November 7, 1990. The government decided on November 23, 1990, a few days after the proposition for a parliamentary investigation to officially disband the network.  Organization, activities and resources  The Belgian Gladio-branch consisted of two separate sections: * S.D.R.A VIII (), residing under the military intelligence service, the Belgian General Information and Security Service (S.G.R) and thus the minister of Defense. * S.T.C/Mob.S.T.C/Mob. was renamed on November 1, 1990 to D.15, but most sources keep referring to its old name. (), residing under the Staatsveiligheid and thus the minister of Justice. S.D.R.A VIII was one of the sections of S.D.R.A (military security service), which in its turn is part of the S.G.R. (general military intelligence and security service). The S.G.R's functions are formally described in a decree from 1989 and are twofold: intelligence gathering and ensuring the security of military personnel and installations, issuing clearances, etc. The S.D.R.A is mandated with the second task, and is dived into functional sections: for instance, S.D.R.A III is contra- infiltration (for S.D.R.A XI, see further). The members of S.D.R.A VIII were military personnel, trained in unorthodox warfare, combat and sabotage, parachute jumping and maritime operations.Ganser... The operatives were trained to accompany the government aboard in case of a Soviet invasion, and then establish liaisons with the Belgian resistance movement and engage in warfare. =Oversight= In the course of the parliamentary investigation, the committee stumbled by chance on the existence of the secretariat of the Coordination and Planning Committee, which formed S.D.R.A XI, but was funded through secret NATO-payments. When Paul Detrembleur, former head of the S.D.R.A and last administrator of S.D.R.A XI/C.P.C.-secretariat, was called to testify before the parliamentary inquiry about the activities of this section in relation to the Gladio-activities, he refused to divulge any information.Parlementaire Commissie (1991), p. 22.Gijsels (1991), pp. 69-70 The final parliamentary report stressed the resulting incomplete insight into the functioning of the C.P.C. and its relation to S.D.R.A. VIII, which formally organized the military section of the Gladio-network. The report noted that the C.P.C. was responsible for the relations between the Belgian secret services and the NATO high command (especially SHAPE), and that the witnesses denied being involved with stay-behind activities. The reason was, the latter claimed, that NATO was \\"forward defending\\"-oriented and thus not interested in stay-behind activities in countries like Belgium, which did not border Warsaw Pact-nations. The commission then further noted the discrepancy between these claims and given reason, and the fact that the C.P.C. co- coordinated the S.D.R.A. VIII and participated in the A.C.C.-meetings.Parlementaire Commissie (1991), p. 23. =S.T.C/Mob. function and oversight= The civilian branch of the Belgian stay-behind had the mission to collect intelligence under conditions of enemy occupation which could be useful to the government and to organize secure communication routes to evacuate the members of the government and other people with official functions. =Military trainers/operatives and civilian operatives= * Recruitment (how, criteria) * Training activities (joint international training/war games, sabotage, intelligence ....) * Funding (equipment) * Weapons, weapons-depots. Both military intelligence and Staatsveiligheid maintained dossiers on Gladio training activities, of which incomplete versions were made available to the parliamentary committee. Events from the list of operations by the military branch was provided by Co√´me and is denoted by A, while events from the list from the archives of the Staatsveiligheid (titled \\"Overzicht oefeningen in het kader ACC - periode 1980-1990\\") is denoted by B: * (A) 1972: Training on clandestine techniques. * (A) 1976: Training on radio-communications, intelligence, maritime operations, aerial operations and escape routes. * (A) 1977: Training on optimizing techniques to locate downed pilots and the use of escape routes. * (A) 1978: In-door training on clandestine missions. * (A) 1980: Training on parachute-jumping, long distance radio communication and clandestine techniques. * (B) June 1980: OREGAN II * (A) 1981: Lessons and training on clandestine activities. * (A) 1983: Training on escape routes, intelligence, aerial operations and radio communications. * (A) 1985: Six trainings (at least two outside Belgium, one in Belgium): infiltration a parachute-jumping, extracting material through escape routes. * (A) 1986, 1987 & 1988: : Trainings outside Belgium on intelligence operations and radio communications. Minister Melchior Wathelet testified before the parliamentary inquiry that secret weapon depots were created in the 1950s, of which a first one was discovered in 1957 due to a landslide, and a second one in 1959 by playing children. He further stated that after these discoveries it was decided to abandon the depots and transfer the weapons to a military depot. An inventory report, dated 1991, for the military section of Gladio mentions inflatable boats, video-equipment and around 300 weapons, including M1 carbines, MP40 submachine guns and \\"armes en cocon\\", weapons packaged for longterm storage.Gijsels (1991), pg. 89  Parliamentary inquiry  = Overview = After the existence of the Belgian branch of the Gladio-network became public, speculations and allegations about involvement of the Gladio-operatives in various high-profile and often unsolved crimes and terroristic acts during the 1980s began to appear in the media. To investigate these allegations and clarify the operation of the Belgian branch, a senatorial investigative commission was established on 20 December 1990. It was tasked with clarifying the structure, aims etc. of the network and the amount of oversight; which connections existed with domestic and foreign intelligence and police services; and whether there was a link with events previously examined in parliamentary inquiriesMore specifically the parliamentary inquiry concerning militia-activity (1980) and combatting serious crime and terrorism (1988), (more). or certain serious crimes and terroristic acts committed the previous decade. Chairman senator Roger Lallemand The commission convened from 16 January 1991 until 5 July 1991, during which fifty seven meetings were held and thirty seven witnesses were heard. Amongst those who testified before the commission were ministers Guy Co√´me, Melchior Wathelet and Louis Tobback; former administrator-director- general of the Staatsveiligheid (77-90) and head of STC-MOB Albert Raes, Ludo Caeymaex (administrator-general Staatsveiligheid 58-77); then current administrator-general of the Staatsveiligheid St√©phane Schewebach, Jacques Devlieghere (Staatsveiligheid 78-89, nr. 2); S.D.R.A.-operative Andr√© Moyen; Gladio-instructors Guibert Nieweling (code name \\"Addie\\"), Michel Huys (\\"Alain\\"), Etienne Annarts (\\"St√©phane\\") = Problems = The two major obstacles facing the commission of inquiry were firstly the secret nature of the case and the related unwillingness of witnesses in disclosing information and secondly time constraints. Firstly, due to the nature of the case, and the various legal, professional and military requirements of confidentiality, the commission went to great lengths in limiting public access to discussed material. For instance, the parliament did forgo an earlier proposition for a parliamentary in favor for the proposition by Lallemand which included the requirement that the commission operated behind closed doors (in contravention to the regular parliamentary inquiry procedures).Gijsels (1991), p. 33. Lallemand placed also additional restriction on the ability to communicate with the press, handling of documents, etc. These restrictions were criticized both for being undemocratic, unnecessary or counter-productive and for not being strict enough.By journalists, senatretc. PRL Raes The committee initially envisaged a solution whereby the names of the operatives were handed to three selected magistrates, familiar with the relevant unsolved criminal investigations. The relevant agencies and witnesses refused to do so, with the refusal varying from polite claims of forgetfulness or references to oaths of secrecy to outright hostility.Ex, ex., radio Brussel... This issue was compounded by the fact that records on former operatives were systematically purged and the magistrates were not up to date with more recent investigations. Gijsels noted that order... ?Names with the CIA/London? The final report then concluded that the cooperation from both the military and the Staatsveiligheid was generally satisfactory, but deplored the stubborn withholding of the names of civilian operatives. Parlementaire Commissie (1991), p. ? Secondly, the commission faced time-related problems. The time allotted to the commission was initially five months, a period which the final report deplored as \\"very little\\" and short in comparison to other inquiries. The Senate granted on July 12, 1991 a request for extra time, which enabled the committee to work for another three months. Unfortunately most of the allotted time fell during the parliamentary recess, which further frustrated the effort to fully pursue the intended lines of inquery. For instance, the commission had planned to interview several investigative journalists, people like Richard Brenneke and had requested several \\"dossiers chauds\\" () like = Handled material and major findings = Handled material: Westmooreland, John Wood/Rudy Daems, ... = Conclusions and impact = Reactions & indirect effect inquiry: Comit√©-I. In 1995, the Belgian Chamber of Representatives organized a parliamentary inquiry into the effectiveness of the Belgian police and judiciary with regards to the Nijvel gang investigation. The conclusions of this inquiry, as well as the earlier Senate inquiry on SDRA8 and the Chamber inquiry on banditism, resulted in the preparation of new legislation governing the mission and methods of the Belgian State Security Service and Belgian General Information and Security Service, which was passed in 1998. Gladio actions and alleged actions = Assassination of Julien Lahaut = In 1950, the assassination of Julien Lahaut, chairman of the Communist Party of Belgium (PCB) had doubtless both a national and international signification, in which Gladio's influence has been suspected.Hans Depraetere and Jenny Dierickx, \\"La Guerre froide en Belgique\\" (\\"Cold War in Belgium\\") (EPO-Dossier, Anvers, 1986) Repeated requests have been made in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives for an investigation into Lahaut's death. Only recently it has become known that Fran√ßois Goossens, a Leopoldist, was his killer. = Attempted coup d'√©tat = A September 10, 1973, note from the Belgian Brigade de Surveillance et de Renseignement intelligence agency described the organization of a coup d'√©tat by certain \\"financial networks and far-right organizations\\", naming among others Emile Lecerf, boss of the Nouvelle Europe magazine (NEM) and political godfather of Francis Dossogne (future leader of far-right Front de la Jeunesse - FJ) and Paul Latinus, founder of the Westland New Post extremist group, in which Gladio's influence has been suspected, although ultimately never proved in justice. Paul Latinus would escape to Pinochet's Chile for a few months in 1981, before \\"committing suicide\\" in 1984. On the other hand, Emile Lecerf was also a member of the Jeune Europe far-right group. = Brabant killers, 1980s = The violence of the Brabant killers was linked in 1985 by the press to a conspiracy among the Belgian stay-behind SDRA8, the Belgian Gendarmerie SDRA6, the Belgian neo-Nazi group Westland New Post, and the Pentagon secret service Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). However, after a parliamentary inquiry, no hard proof sustaining these claims was found, and investigations into the Brabant killers continue to this day. However, the mystery of how those cold-blooded massacres were committed did convince the Belgian Parliament to create a Permanent Committee of Surveillance of Intelligence Agencies' activities.Permanent Committee for the Control of Intelligence Agencies (Belgium) See in particular the \\"history\\" section in the \\"Presentation\\" part. = Jean Thiriart's far-right Parti Communautaire Europ√©en = According to Amnistia.net, Luc Jouret, founder of the Order of the Solar Temple with Joseph di Mambro, had helped far-right activist Jean Thiriart organize a split in the Communist Party of Belgium (PCB) in the 1970s, creating the \\"Parti Communautaire Europ√©en, a \\"Nazi- Maoist\\" party which succeeded to the Jeune Europe far-right group. According to Bruno Fouchereau, author of La mafia des sectes and collaborator of Le Monde Diplomatique, quoted by Amnistia, this Belgium \\"Nazi-Maoist group\\" was in fact controlled by the SDRA-8, Belgium's branch of Gladio. SDRA-8 other's creation was the Westland New Post group.Amnistia info on the Order of the Solar Temple and links with Gladio Le Soir controversy In 1996, Le Soir newspaper caused a public uproar by revealing the existence of a classified document, dated August 1995, and titled \\"Plan de base de la d√©fense militaire du territoire\\" (\\"Basic plan for the military defense of the territory\\"). The newspaper quoted some passages of what it called a \\"racist plan\\": \\"Many immigrant communities now populate large urban areas. Should these population groups ever adopt a position that is in strong disagreement with Belgian policies, they could launch actions intended to counteract these policies or to make their concerns known ... In our estimation there is no open threat in Belgium ... But there is a permanent, clandestine threat\\" ( - sic). The dissolved SDRA-8 had been replaced by the \\"Commandement territorial interforces\\" (CTI), a military intelligence agency organized by provinces and essentially composed of about a thousand reserve officers. Its goal was to infiltrate civil society and find informants, with the mission to be especially concerned by the \\"immigrant communities which represented a permanent clandestine threat\\". According to Le Soir, if the CTI is not closely linked to the military agency Service G√©n√©ral du Renseignement et de la S√©curit√© (SGRS), then it is \\"nothing else than a new structure of military intelligence... particularly suspicious of anything that is foreign to it\\". Defense minister Poncelet replied in the Belgian Senate that the plan was only an internal draft proposal, which was never approved by the military command or the defense minister himself. Finally, the activities of the Belgian military intelligence agencies prompted the Parliamentary Committee of Surveillance (Comit√© R) to investigate various abusive wiretappings. \\"The central documentation of the SGR is composed of 450 000 files\\", stated Le Soir.  BBET, 2006  The police arrest of members of far-right group Bloed, Bodem, Eer en Trouw in September 2006 made the Belgian press recall the \\"Bloody Eighties\\", during which the Brabant massacres were carried out (28 deaths), and the Marxist organization Communist Combatant Cells carried out terrorist attacks (2 deaths). According to Justice Minister Laurette Onkelinx and Interior Minister Patrick Dewael, the suspects (11 of whom were members of the military) were preparing terrorist attacks in order to \\"destabilize\\" Belgium.

History  Baroque St. Adalbert Church Margonin dates back to the 7th century, and in the 9th‚Äì12th it was a defensive stronghold, which became part of Poland after the establishment of the state in the 10th century. Margonin was first mentioned when Archbishop Jaros≈Çaw Bogoria of Skotniki of Gniezno and the Bishop of Pozna≈Ñ, Jan Doliwa, agreed on May 15, 1364 that Margonin parish should belong to the Diocese of Pozna≈Ñ. Town rights were received in 1402. Margonin was a private town of Polish nobility, administratively located in the Kcynia County in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown.Atlas historyczny Polski. Wielkopolska w drugiej po≈Çowie XVI wieku. Czƒô≈õƒá I. Mapy, plany, Instytut Historii Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Warszawa, 2017, p. 1b (in Polish) Much of the town was destroyed in 1655 during the Swedish invasion of Poland (Deluge), and the town lost its rights. They were restored on July 20, 1696. An orphanage was established in 1725. The Catholic Church was heavily damaged by a storm in 1737, and was repaired between 1753 and 1755. As a result of the First Partition of Poland, in 1772, it was annexed by Prussia. Polish jurist, poet, political and military activist J√≥zef Wybicki, best known as the author of the lyrics of the national anthem of Poland, married Kunegunda Drwƒôska in Margonin in 1773. In the Napoleonic period, in 1807 it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, but in 1815 it was re-annexed by Prussia, and was then part of the semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Posen until 1848, and then part of the Prussian province of Posen until 1918, also within Germany from 1871. Gas lanterns illuminated the town from 1905. In 1908, the town was connected to the railway spur running between Go≈Ça≈Ñcz (then officially Gollantsch) and Chodzie≈º (Kolmar). After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence and the Greater Poland uprising (1918‚Äì19) broke out, which aim was to reintegrate the region with Poland. Polish insurgents captured Margonin on January 6, 1919. It was recaptured by Germans in February, despite prior agreements. Nevertheless, in accordance to the Treaty of Versailles, it was reintegrated with Poland in January 1920. 18 inhabitants of Margonin and its suburbs died in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, and four were awarded with the Virtuti Militari, the highest Polish military decoration, for their bravery in the Battle of Warsaw (1920). In interwar Poland Margonin became a popular tourist destination with several hotels. During World War II, the town was under German occupation from September 5, 1939 to January 22, 1945, the area having been made part of the Reichsgau Wartheland.

The original music score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith and the cinematography was by Harry Stradling Jr. Plot First Lieutenant Jake Tanner (Jan-Michael Vincent) shares ICBM silo duty at an American air force missile base in the Californian desert with Major Eugene \\"Sam\\" Denton (George Peppard), who is requesting not to work with him. On their way to duty, Denton talks to Sergeant Tom Keegan (Paul Winfield), an aspiring artist. When the United States detects incoming nuclear missiles from the Soviet Union, Tanner and Denton launch part of the retaliatory strike. The United States is hit hard, although it manages to intercept 40% of the Soviet missiles. Two years later, the Earth has been tilted off its axis by the nuclear detonations of World War III; radiation has mutated giant scorpions, the planet is wracked by massive storms, and the sky is in a perpetual aurora borealis-like state. Tanner has resigned his commission and has been scouting Barstow while Keegan, who has also left the Air Force, has been painting as an artist in one of the base's out-buildings. Mutated giant scorpions menace the area. Later an airman falls asleep in a bunk and drops a lit cigarette onto a pile of Playboy magazines, which causes the entire base to catch fire and explode, killing most of its inhabitants including the base commander, General Lander (Murray Hamilton). Keegan and Tanner are unscathed, as are Denton and Lieutenant Tom Perry (Kip Niven), who were in an underground garage bunker. Denton has been considering going to Albany, New York to find the source of the lone radio transmission that has been aired weekly since the war. He and the remaining others set out in two Air Force \\"Landmasters,\\" giant, gas guzzling, 12-wheeled armored personnel carriers capable of climbing 60-degree inclines and operating in water. They must cross \\"Damnation Alley,\\" considered \\"the path of least resistance\\" between intense radiation areas thus named by Denton. Along their journey one of the Landmasters becomes disabled in a storm (which also kills Perry) and they encounter mutated \\"flesh stripping cockroaches\\" in the ruins of Salt Lake City that eat Keegan alive. Denton and Tanner also pick up two survivors: a woman in Las Vegas, Janice (Dominique Sanda), and a teenage boy, Billy (Jackie Earle Haley), discovered in an abandoned house. Later they fight off a band of crazed gun-toting mountain men they encounter in the ruins of a gas station. Denton uses a rocket launcher to destroy the gas station. As they continue their journey, the Landmaster develops a problem with its drivetrain and they head to Detroit. Denton comments that it was \\"designed to use spare truck parts\\", semi-trucks in particular. In Detroit they enter a large wrecking yard in search of the needed parts. A large storm comes upon the group and they take shelter in their vehicle just as a tsunami washes them away. After the storm passes, they are adrift in a large body of water and it appears that the Earth has returned to its normal axis as the sky is clear. Using the Landmaster's amphibious capability, they reach land. As they are making repairs, they hear a radio broadcast of music and an attempt to reach survivors. After Denton makes radio contact, Tanner and Billy set out on Tanner's dirt bike to locate the source of the broadcast. In the final scene, they reach a surprisingly intact suburb of Albany and are greeted by its inhabitants. Cast * Jan-Michael Vincent as 1st Lt.

Zelazny was quite pleased with the first script by Lukas Heller and expected it to be the shooting script. However, the studio had Alan Sharp write a different version that left out many of the elements of Zelazny's book. Zelazny did not realize this until he saw the movie in the theater. He disliked the movie, but assertions that he requested to have his name removed from the credits are completely unfounded, since he did not know there was a problem until after the movie had been released.\\"...And Call Me Roger\\": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 4, by Christopher S. Kovacs. In: The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 4: Last Exit to Babylon, NESFA Press, 2009. Budgeted at US $7.2 million, Damnation Alley was helmed by veteran director Jack Smight, who had scored two consecutive box office hits in the previous two years (Airport 1975 and Midway). Filming began on June 21, 1976, east of the town of Borrego Springs, California, where a missile base set was constructed, as well as locations in Meteor Crater, Arizona, Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada, Salt Lake City, Utah, and the Mojave Desert in California. The lake scenes were filmed at Flathead Lake in Kalispell, Montana. Filming wrapped on August 13, 1976. Production was rife with problems ‚Äî the devastated landscapes and giant mutated insects proved to be nearly impossible to create, despite the large budget. For example, a sequence involving giant scorpions attacking a motorcycle was first attempted using full-scale scorpion props, but they did not work and the resulting footage was unacceptable. The solution was to use actual scorpions composited onto live action footage using the blue screen process in post-production. Another action sequence with giant cockroaches used a combination of live Madagascar hissing cockroaches and large numbers of rubber bugs which looked unconvincing onscreen, as the strings pulling mats covered in fake insects were plainly visible. To complicate matters, according to director Jack Smight in his memoir, studio chief Alan Ladd, Jr. redirected about a quarter of Damnation Alley's production budget as completion funds for George Lucas' lower-budgeted film, Star Wars. Smight was not made aware of the budget reduction on Damnation Alley until he neared its completion, which further compromised most of the remaining special effects work, for which there was now very little money left. The original director's cut of the film delivered to the studio by Jack Smight in late-1976 ran 2 hours and 15 minutes. Even though the special effects work was not completed at that time, the studio made minor changes to the cut, and awaited the completion of the special effects work prior to releasing it. While the effects were underway, the completion funds were diverted to Star Wars, which eliminated several important effects scenes which had not yet been created, including the Minuteman III missile launch sequences, the base explosion, and importantly, the storm and tsunami in the last act. Because these scenes were cut, Fox relied on stock footage from other films (and public domain footage of missile launches and nuclear explosions) for those particular shots. Because of this, and the last-minute decision to add \\"radioactive skies\\" in special effects, Damnation Alley was in post-production well past the intended release date of December, 1976 due to the difficult process of superimposing optical effects on the sky in about 300 shots (which was not planned for during filming, resulting in poor execution of the effect). This pushed the release date from December, 1976 to March, 1977, and then again to June, 1977. It was during this delay that 20th Century Fox released their \\"other\\" science fiction film for 1977, Star Wars. The studio had planned to release only two science fiction films that year, with Damnation Alley intended to be the blockbuster. Star Wars became a hit of epic proportions, and forced Fox to further delay and re-address a struggling Damnation Alley, which was still languishing in post-production special effects work. In a panic, the release date was delayed to December, 1977, but moved up to October when the studio realized it would go up against the release of an expected hit, Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. With the additional delay, Fox re-edited the entire film. Smight was already involved with another project during this time, so Fox took over the re-edit. The decision was made to cut down the length of the film to the bare-minimum running time of 90 minutes for a theatrical release, and large sections of the film were edited out by the studio. These cuts amounted to 44 minutes of footage, and included a major subplot of a love triangle between Tanner, Denton, and Janice. Many scenes early in the film at the missile base were excised as well - sequences which showed the breakdown of military order. Murray Hamilton was featured prominently in several scenes which were cut, as the now-despondent and alcoholic General in charge of the base (which rendered his character literally \\"mute\\" in the final film, with no lines of dialogue). Critically, a physical confrontation between Tanner and Denton after the death of Keegan by \\"killer cockroaches\\" was removed (in this scene, Tanner blames Denton for not saving his friend from death). In spite of these major edits, Fox focused more content on the \\"Landmaster\\" vehicle, and the special effects, in direct response to Star Wars. The film underwent several name changes during this period, from the original \\"Damnation Alley\\" to \\"Salvation Road,\\" and then to \\"Survival Run\\" up until shortly before the release, when it was again renamed \\"Damnation Alley\\". The film was finally released in the United States on October 21, 1977 to fleeting success when it opened, but poor critical reviews word of mouth tanked it at the box office. =Landmaster= Perhaps the most notable aspect of the film was the Landmaster vehicle, which features a hinged center section, and a unique rotating 12-wheel assembly. The \\"Landmaster\\" was custom-built for the film at a cost of $350,000 in 1976 by automotive customizer Dean Jeffries. ($1.4 million in 2010 dollars) The Landmaster was sold to a private owner in 2005 and was restored to its original condition as featured in the film. The Landmaster was then on the show car circuit for several years.Landmaster picture from its recent showing. In 2007 it was featured at the San Francisco Rod & Custom Show at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, California2007 San Francisco Rod, Custom and Motorcycle Show Event Guide as part of a special exhibit with other notable movie and TV cars. The Landmaster should not be confused with the superficially similar, but simpler Ark II. =Sound 360= A few big-city premiere engagements of Damnation Alley were presented in Sound 360, a high-impact surround-sound process. Jerry Goldsmith's score made good use of the wide stereo separation afforded by Sound 360, particularly in the opening theme, with fanfares emanating from each side of the theater in turn. Reception Damnation Alley opened in 1977, one year after it was filmed. After the release, it quickly left the theaters because it did not make enough to stay in the chain theaters, duplexes or triplexes. Dismissal of the film was noted, overshadowed by prior apocalypse-themed films like Day the World Ended and On the Beach. In some theaters during 1977, the film was paired with another film, Ralph Bakshi's fantasy Wizards, which was financially successful. In the UK, Damnation Alley was released in January 1979 as a double bill with Thunder and Lightning, another 20th Century Fox film from 1977. Television version The network TV premiere on NBC television on Sunday, June 12, 1983 featured alternate and additional scenes re-inserted (notably, footage of Murray Hamilton and George Peppard, where Denton asks for permission to leave the missile base, as well as additional scenes with Dominique Sanda and Peppard, where Denton tells Janice about his wife who died in the nuclear war). The network premiere was a ratings success, finishing second in the Nielsen Ratings for the week. Home media Damnation Alley was released on VHS, Betamax, and Video 2000 formats in the United Kingdom in 1983, and on VHS and Betamax in the United States in 1985. Shout! Factory released the film (on DVD and Blu-ray) on July 12, 2011 in the United States. This release features a new anamorphic widescreen transfer, and audio commentary with producer Paul Maslansky, as well as extras including featurettes detailing the challenges in making the film, and a detailed examination of the now-famous Landmaster vehicle with designer and builder Dean Jeffries. The original \\"Sound 360\\" audio mix is not featured on the DVD and Blu-ray, as the original elements were too damaged to salvage. The film was also released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2011.

The probability density function of the normal distribution is quasiconcave but not concave. The bivariate normal joint density is quasiconcave. In mathematics, a quasiconvex function is a real-valued function defined on an interval or on a convex subset of a real vector space such that the inverse image of any set of the form (-\\\\infty,a) is a convex set. For a function of a single variable, along any stretch of the curve the highest point is one of the endpoints. The negative of a quasiconvex function is said to be quasiconcave. All convex functions are also quasiconvex, but not all quasiconvex functions are convex, so quasiconvexity is a generalization of convexity. Quasiconvexity and quasiconcavity extend to functions with multiple arguments the notion of unimodality of functions with a single real argument. Definition and properties A function f:S \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} defined on a convex subset S of a real vector space is quasiconvex if for all x, y \\\\in S and \\\\lambda \\\\in [0,1] we have : f(\\\\lambda x + (1 - \\\\lambda)y)\\\\leq\\\\max\\\\big\\\\\\\\{f(x),f(y)\\\\big\\\\\\\\}. In words, if f is such that it is always true that a point directly between two other points does not give a higher value of the function than both of the other points do, then f is quasiconvex. Note that the points x and y, and the point directly between them, can be points on a line or more generally points in n-dimensional space. A quasilinear function is both quasiconvex and quasiconcave. The graph of a function that is both concave and quasi-convex on the nonnegative real numbers. An alternative way (see introduction) of defining a quasi-convex function f(x) is to require that each sublevel set S_\\\\alpha(f) = \\\\\\\\{x\\\\mid f(x) \\\\leq \\\\alpha\\\\\\\\} is a convex set. If furthermore : f(\\\\lambda x + (1 - \\\\lambda)y)<\\\\max\\\\big\\\\\\\\{f(x),f(y)\\\\big\\\\\\\\} for all x eq y and \\\\lambda \\\\in (0,1), then f is strictly quasiconvex. That is, strict quasiconvexity requires that a point directly between two other points must give a lower value of the function than one of the other points does. A quasiconcave function is a function whose negative is quasiconvex, and a strictly quasiconcave function is a function whose negative is strictly quasiconvex. Equivalently a function f is quasiconcave if : f(\\\\lambda x + (1 - \\\\lambda)y)\\\\geq\\\\min\\\\big\\\\\\\\{f(x),f(y)\\\\big\\\\\\\\}. and strictly quasiconcave if : f(\\\\lambda x + (1 - \\\\lambda)y)>\\\\min\\\\big\\\\\\\\{f(x),f(y)\\\\big\\\\\\\\} A (strictly) quasiconvex function has (strictly) convex lower contour sets, while a (strictly) quasiconcave function has (strictly) convex upper contour sets. A function that is both quasiconvex and quasiconcave is quasilinear. A particular case of quasi-concavity, if S \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}, is unimodality, in which there is a locally maximal value. Applications Quasiconvex functions have applications in mathematical analysis, in mathematical optimization, and in game theory and economics. =Mathematical optimization= In nonlinear optimization, quasiconvex programming studies iterative methods that converge to a minimum (if one exists) for quasiconvex functions. Quasiconvex programming is a generalization of convex programming.: Quasiconvex programming is used in the solution of \\"surrogate\\" dual problems, whose biduals provide quasiconvex closures of the primal problem, which therefore provide tighter bounds than do the convex closures provided by Lagrangian dual problems. In theory, quasiconvex programming and convex programming problems can be solved in reasonable amount of time, where the number of iterations grows like a polynomial in the dimension of the problem (and in the reciprocal of the approximation error tolerated); Kiwiel acknowledges that Yuri Nesterov first established that quasiconvex minimization problems can be solved efficiently. however, such theoretically \\"efficient\\" methods use \\"divergent-series\\" stepsize rules, which were first developed for classical subgradient methods. Classical subgradient methods using divergent-series rules are much slower than modern methods of convex minimization, such as subgradient projection methods, bundle methods of descent, and nonsmooth filter methods. =Economics and partial differential equations: Minimax theorems= In microeconomics, quasiconcave utility functions imply that consumers have convex preferences. Quasiconvex functions are important also in game theory, industrial organization, and general equilibrium theory, particularly for applications of Sion's minimax theorem. Generalizing a minimax theorem of John von Neumann, Sion's theorem is also used in the theory of partial differential equations. Preservation of quasiconvexity =Operations preserving quasiconvexity= * maximum of quasiconvex functions (i.e. f = \\\\max \\\\left\\\\lbrace f_1 , \\\\ldots , f_n \\\\right\\\\rbrace ) is quasiconvex. Similarly, maximum of strict quasiconvex functions is strict quasiconvex. Similarly, the minimum of quasiconcave functions is quasiconcave, and the minimum of strictly-quasiconcave functions is strictly-quasiconcave. * composition with a non-decreasing function (i.e. g : \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} quasiconvex, h : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} non-decreasing, then f = h \\\\circ g is quasiconvex) * minimization (i.e. f(x,y) quasiconvex, C convex set, then h(x) = \\\\inf_{y \\\\in C} f(x,y) is quasiconvex) =Operations not preserving quasiconvexity= * The sum of quasiconvex functions defined on the same domain need not be quasiconvex: In other words, if f(x), g(x) are quasiconvex, then (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) need not be quasiconvex. * The sum of quasiconvex functions defined on different domains (i.e. if f(x), g(y) are quasiconvex, h(x,y) = f(x) + g(y)) need not be quasiconvex. Such functions are called \\"additively decomposed\\" in economics and \\"separable\\" in mathematical optimization. Examples * Every convex function is quasiconvex. * A concave function can be quasiconvex. For example, x \\\\mapsto \\\\log(x) is both concave and quasiconvex. * Any monotonic function is both quasiconvex and quasiconcave. More generally, a function which decreases up to a point and increases from that point on is quasiconvex (compare unimodality). *The floor function x\\\\mapsto \\\\lfloor x\\\\rfloor is an example of a quasiconvex function that is neither convex nor continuous.

A new high school, Shadow Hills in the northern half of Indio will decrease the number of students in the 2009/10 school year. In the 2009/10 school year Desert Sands was deciding whether to close the school at the end of the 2009/10 school year, due to low Standardized Test scores. That year the scores went up dramatically and the board instead voted to renovate the school, which was approved. The School was featured in a video for success 101, a course for freshmen entering high school to help them transition from middle to high school. Freshman students, faculty, and teachers of the 2010/11 school year were followed all school year to see how the class had helped them.http://www.whatworkscareerchoices.com/success101doc.html For the 2011/12 school year the school moved from a six-period day schedule to an eight-period A/B Block schedule. This was done to give the students more electives and also so they would have opportunities to get more credits. On May 1, 2013 at 8:52, there was a fire at the boy's locker room coaches office.

He served as the head football coach at the United States Air Force Academy (1979‚Äì1983), the University of Arkansas (1984‚Äì1989), Clemson University (1990‚Äì1993), and Rice University (1994‚Äì2005), compiling a career college football record of 168‚Äì140‚Äì4. Playing career Hatfield is a graduate of the University of Arkansas, where he starred at defensive back for the 1964 team that won a share of the national championship. Among his teammates were future Dallas Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson and future Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. He is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Coaching career =Air Force= Hatfield with Air Force Hatfield began his college head coaching career at the United States Air Force Academy from 1979 to 1983. He gradually rebuilt a program that had struggled through most of the 1970s and laid the foundation for its success in the 1980s and early 1990s under his offensive coordinator and successor, Fisher DeBerry. By his final year, the Falcons were ranked 13th in the country by the Coaches' Poll and 15th in the AP Poll‚Äîtheir first appearance in a final poll since 1970. =Arkansas= Hatfield then moved to his alma mater, Arkansas, where he compiled a 55‚Äì17‚Äì1 record from 1984 to 1989. His teams won two straight Southwest Conference titles in 1988 and 1989, a feat that the Razorbacks had not accomplished since his playing days. On January 2, 1989, Hatfield became the first former player to coach his alma mater in the Cotton Bowl Classic. Arkansas's Southwest Conference championship in 1989 is the program's last conference title to date. Hatfield had a somewhat frosty relationship with longtime Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles, even though Broyles had been his coach during his playing days. Broyles had a reputation for being very hands-on with the football program he had built into a national power as head coach from 1958 to 1976. As good as Hatfield's last two Razorback teams had been, he lost several recruits after 1987 when rival coaches claimed he was in Broyles' doghouse. When Broyles signed a new five-year contract in early 1990, Hatfield left for Clemson University without even visiting the campus. Later, when Hatfield was asked if Broyles had been a factor in his abrupt departure from Fayetteville, he replied, \\"His name is on the (athletics) building down there. Let that be my answer.\\"Murphy, Austin. Not exactly Hog Heaven. Sports Illustrated, September 21, 1992. Ironically, the coach Hatfield succeeded at Clemson, Danny Ford, would eventually become the Razorbacks' coach in 1993. =Clemson= Hatfield coached at Clemson from 1990 to 1993, compiling a 32‚Äì13‚Äì1 record. He did much to clean up the program's image in the aftermath of sanctions from the Ford era.Hanley, Brian. Clemson gets \\"Real McCoy\\". Chicago Sun-Times, December 30, 1990. In his second season, 1991, he led the Tigers to their last ACC title in the pre-championship game era. However, Hatfield was never really accepted by Clemson's fans. A common saying among Tiger fans during this time was \\"Howard built it. Ford filled it. Hatfield killed it.\\" Largely due to this discontent, school officials refused to grant him a one-year extension on his contract after the 1993 season, even though the Tigers had rebounded from 5‚Äì6 in 1992 (Clemson's first losing season in 16 years) to a solid 8‚Äì3 record that year and a Peach Bowl appearance. Angered at what he saw as a lack of support, Hatfield resigned at the end of the regular season.Clemson coach quits. The New York Times, November 25, 1993. =Rice= Soon afterward, Hatfield was hired at Rice University, where he compiled a 55‚Äì78‚Äì1 record before resigning on November 30, 2005 following a 1‚Äì10 season. He only had three winning seasons in 12 years. Although the Owls were bowl-eligible in those three winning seasons, they weren't invited to a bowl in part because of the school's small alumni and fan base. Rice is the second-smallest school in Division I FBS and often had to play schools 10 times its size or more (and in some cases, with more freshmen than it has students), a major reason why he wasn't as successful as he had been at his previous stops. In his first year, despite a losing overall record, he managed to lead the Owls to a share of the Southwest Conference title and a victory over the rival Texas Longhorns on national TV. =Football coaching philosophy= One of the few remaining proponents of the conservative triple-option offense in college football, Hatfield compiled a 168‚Äì140‚Äì4 record as a head coach.

Its corporate headquarters are located in Boca Raton, Florida, with additional offices in California, New York, and Taiwan. The company primarily deals in adult entertainment, online dating, and social networking services. Its flagship online dating services include FriendFinder and its various spin-off services (such as Adult FriendFinder, and other dating services targeting various territories and niche categories, such as the South America-focused Amigos.com, and Christian dating website BigChurch), as well as niche websites for alternative lifestyles, and adult webcam websites. In 2007, the company was acquired by the owners of Penthouse magazine, and adopted its current name. In 2016, the Penthouse brand was sold off. History FriendFinder was launched in 1996 by Andrew Conru. After discovering that users had been using the service to seek sexual partners, he launched Adult FriendFinder as a spin-off, followed later by other spin-offs dealing with different regions and niches. Much of the company's growth without investment capital has been attributed to its affiliate program, with more than 500,000 affiliates to date. In 2007, Penthouse Media Group purchased FriendFinder's parent company, Various, Inc., for $500 million. Penthouse later changed its name to FriendFinder Networks. In 2008, the company filed for a $460 million initial public offering. Most of the money generated was to pay down $420.1 million in short-term debt and other obligations. As of January 17, 2010, FriendFinder Networks had a negative net worth equal to $118 million, $32 million in cash on hand and $650 million in liabilities. The company had also indicated that it lacked existing cash or cash from operations to repay a $44.5 million debt that was due July 31. It has cautioned that, unless it can repay or restructure its obligation, it will face ‚Äúa material deficiency in our short term liquidity.‚Äù With these shortfalls in mind, the company again announced an intention to make an initial public offering of stock, representing a 49% stake in the company, with plans to use the proceeds to pay down its debt and become listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The contemplated public offering, scheduled to reach the market on January 27, 2010 was delayed by FFN. On February 5, 2010, FFN announced its intention to indefinitely delay its contemplated IPO until market conditions improve. In June 2010, FriendFinder Networks made a $210 million bid to acquire Playboy Enterprises. Hugh Hefner, who owned 70 percent of the voting stock, did not want to sell. = Bankruptcy, reorganization = In August 2013, FriendFinder was delisted from the NASDAQ because its stock had not traded for more than $1. On September 16, 2013, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. FriendFinder had not turned a net profit since at least 2008. Ezra Shashoua, the company's chief financial officer, blamed the lower revenue on a drop in membership and increased advertising costs for affiliates, according to court documents. Shashoua also said credit card companies had refused to process transactions for the company's Internet businesses. The company stated it had negotiated a deal with noteholders that would reduce its debt by $300 million. In December 2013, FriendFinder Networks' reorganization plan won court approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. Founder Andrew Conru, was named as the reorganized company's chairman and CEO. In February 2016, FriendFinder Networks sold the rights to the Penthouse brand to Penthouse Global Media, a new company formed by the brand's managing director Kelly Holland. = Security breach = On November 13, 2016, it was reported that a database of over 412 million accounts, including usernames, e-mails, and passwords, had been breached and leaked from several FriendFinder Networks websites. The breach included account data from Adult FriendFinder (which constituted over 339 million accounts), Cams.com, and Penthouse, including accounts that had supposedly been deleted. The passwords were either stored as plain text or encrypted using the obsolete and insecure SHA-1 cipher.

Education and career Falcoff earned a B.A. in political science from the University of Missouri in 1963, and would later earn a Ph.D. and M.A. at Princeton University. He served as a consultant and staff member on a number of important committees and commissions, including the 1983 National Bipartisan Commission on Central America and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. He has taught at the University of Illinois and the University of Oregon and lectured at several universities. The focus of Falcoff's work is Latin America and related US policies. He has authored numerous publication on subjects ranging from the causes of the Juan Per√≥n period of Argentine politics to the controversial US handover of the Panama Canal to Panama. Many of his books are published in conjunction with AEI; the latest of these is Cuba the Morning After: Confronting Castro's Legacy, which attempts to challenge common assumptions pertaining to Cuba-United States relations and the impact on Cuba of Fidel Castro's eventual demise. In a 2003 article for Commentary, Falcoff defended former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (who served as the head of the 1983 commission on Central America which Falcoff consulted) against claims, most notably made by Christopher Hitchens in The Trial of Henry Kissinger, that Kissinger, as the US Secretary of State, was the chief architect for the Chilean coup of 1973, and subsequent atrocities committed by the forces of President Augusto Pinochet. Falcoff's articles have appeared in a number of influential newspapers and academic journals, such as The Washington Post, The New Republic, and Foreign Affairs.

Biography Boris Shteifon was born in 1881 in Kharkov (now in Ukraine). His father was a Jewish merchant converted to Orthodox Christianity, his mother was the daughter of a Russian Orthodox deacon. He graduated from the Chuguyivske Junker Infantry School, one of the premier schools of the Imperial Russian Army, and went to serve as a second lieutenant in the 124th Infantry Regiment based at Voronezh. He first saw combat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, during which he was injured with a concussion. He was also awarded for bravery and excellence five times, receiving the Order of St. Vladimir along with other decorations. He was promoted to lieutenant in September 1905. In 1911, Shteifon completed the Imperial Nikolaevsky Military Academy with the rank of captain. He was subsequently assigned to serve in Russian Turkestan, and was a staff officer of the 2nd Turkistan Army Corps in 1914. With the start of World War I, Shteifon served on the Caucasus front against the forces of the Ottoman Empire. He was Assistant Chief of Intelligence in the staff of the Russian Caucasian Army, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1915. He played a key role in the Battle of Erzurum under General Nikolai Yudenich and was awarded the Order of St. Anne and Order of St. George for conducting intelligence operations. In January 1917 he was appointed Chief of Staff of the 161 Infantry Division and then in August of that year, the head of the Finnish 3rd Infantry Division. In 1917 he was promoted to colonel. In the wake of the October Revolution and the collapse at the Russian front, Shteifon returned to his native Kharkov where he headed an underground organization to recruit and relay officers who wanted to join the Volunteer Army. In the fall of 1918 he arrived at Volunteer Army headquarters in Ekaterinodar. He became Chief of Staff of the 3rd Infantry Division of the Volunteer Army in April 1919, and commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment from July. He was active in operations throughout the Ukraine and parts of Poland and Romania through the end of the year. In January 1920 Shteifon was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. However, with the growing collapse of the White movement, he was forced to evacuate into Poland with his men, then arrived in Crimea to continue active duty under General Pyotr Wrangel. He evacuated with the remnants of Wrangel's forces to Constantinople and arrived to the Gallipoli camp for White Russian refugees. On 25 April 1921, he was put in charge of the exiled 1st Army Corps, and relocated to Bulgaria. In 1922, the Bulgarian government expelled Shteifon, and he found refuge in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Living in Belgrade, he actively participated in the Officers' Union, but was removed by General Wrangel for insubordination. During the 1920s and 1930s, Shteifon published a series of military tactical and historical works, and became a professor of military sciences. After occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by Nazi Germany in April 1941, Shteifon was offered a position of chief of staff of the Russian Corps organized in Belgrade on 12 September by the Germans on the initiative of former Russian general Mikhail Skorodumov and became its commander three days later. Until the spring of 1944, the principal task of the Russian Corps, which was mainly composed of former servicemen of the Russian Imperial Army and the White Army, was to guard certain sites and areas from the Communist partisans led by Josip Broz Tito, who were supported by the USSR and later in the war also by Britain; in 1944 the Corps was actively engaged in fighting against Tito‚Ä≤s partisans; and finally, from September 1944, after the previously Germany-allied Romania and Bulgaria switched sides and regular units of the Red Army advanced into the Western Balkans, the Corps also fought against the regular Soviet troops in Serbia and later in what is now Croatia. He died in Zagreb‚Ä≤s Esplanade hotel on 30 April 1945.

It consists mainly of the combined waters of the San Antonio and Guadalupe rivers, and is located at the mouth of the Guadalupe River, about 55 miles (89 km) northeast of Corpus Christi and 130 miles (209 km) southeast of San Antonio. It is protected from the Gulf of Mexico by Matagorda Island, leaving only relatively small and distant outlets to the Gulf for little mixing of bay and Gulf waters. The remoteness of the bay has prevented the establishment of major ports as seen on Aransas Bay and Corpus Christi Bay, to the south. San Antonio Bay is one of seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas. The Aransas National Wildlife Refuge is found on the southwest portion of the bay. The diverse wildlife on these shores make up for the lack of a sizable human settlement. History The Karankawa Indians used the land near the Guadalupe River delta and San Antonio Bay for camping purposes. They also populated Matagorda Island on the opposite side of the bay. Captain Luis Cazorla of Presidio La Bah√≠a crossed San Antonio Bay to visit the island in 1776, and discovered that the Indians had killed the mates of a shipwrecked British trading vessel. For a short time, he convinced the Indian leaders not to kill shipwreck survivors on the island. An effort was made to convert the Indians with the establishment of Mission Refugio on San Antonio Bay in 1793, after Fray Jos√© Francisco Garza found a shallow crossing that the Indians used to travel to the mainland. To prevent the Indians from using Matagorda Island as a hiding place to stage attacks, La Bah√≠a commandant Juan Cort√©s burned and cut brush around the point of crossing. No permanent colony was ever established on the island. After the arrival of white settlers to the baytown of Hynesville in the 19th century, the Karankawa began to commit offenses against the settlers, including the unsanctioned slaughter of their livestock. As a result, the settlers engaged the Indians at the 1852 Battle of Hynes Bay, near the San Antonio Bay extension of Hynes Bay. The Karankawa were swiftly defeated, and the survivors agreed to never return; finding refuge across the Rio Grande in Tamaulipas. A few years later, the Hynes extension began to fill with mud, leaving it shallow and hard to navigate. Reports from Hynesville suggest that alligators infested the bay, killing a few residents. At the beginning of the 20th century, Preston R. Austin set out to build a new port on the western shore. He established the town of Austwell in 1911, and quickly began dredging in 1914 to build a channel. In the early stages of development, the channel filled with mud and was abandoned. Meanwhile, on the eastern shore, the city of Seadrift, which had been established following the American Civil War, began to develop into a place of interest for fishing and shipping. The town, which was most likely named for floating debris swept ashore by the Guadalupe River, was incorporated in 1912, and by 1914 had a population of 1,250. The growth subsided in 1919, after a hurricane ravaged the area. In 1926, only 321 lived in the town. The population slowly recovered, and had surpassed its original peak in 1990, following a wave of Vietnamese refugees, who emigrated to the city after the Vietnam War. In 2000, the city had 1,352 residents. Features Ayres Bay (orange), Espiritu Santo Bay (red), Guadalupe Bay (cyan), Hynes Bay (blue violet), Mission Lake (pink), Pringle Lake (brown), San Antonio Bay (green) The land near the bay lies on the Texas Coastal Plain. It consists of grassy prairies, which support conifers and water-tolerant hardwoods. Most of the surrounding land is used for agricultural purposes with the exception of Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, which is preserved for wildlife. On average, the San Antonio Bay system is deep, and covers approximately . The system is made up of the bay itself and its extensions. The main extensions include: Espiritu Santo Bay, to the bay's east; Hynes Bay, to the northwest, and Guadalupe Bay due north. Together with its extensions, San Antonio Bay forms one of seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas, receiving the discharge from the converged San Antonio and Guadalupe rivers. Every second, approximately of water flows into the bay. Minimal seawater exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Pass Cavallo. As a result of the seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 13 parts per thousand (ppt), compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. Ecosystem A wide variety of wildlife can be found in and around San Antonio Bay. According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the following fish have been caught in the bay: palmetto bass, striped bass, hardhead catfish, black drum, red drum, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, lefteye flounder, pinfish, spotted seatrout, and the sheepshead. The shores along the bay, specifically the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, are home to countless birds including the endangered whooping crane, pelicans, herons, egrets, roseate spoonbills, shorebirds, ducks, and geese. American alligators, collared peccaries, feral hogs, coyotes, bobcats, raccoon and white-tailed deer as well as clams and crabs are included among the bay's diverse wildlife. Several pelicans that had been rescued and cleaned after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, were brought to the shore of San Antonio Bay in June 2010. Industry Nearly detached from the Gulf of Mexico by barrier islands, San Antonio Bay does not support a large shipping industry. The only port of merit on the bay is Seadrift, where a shipping channel has been dredged to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. Most inhabitants near the bay work at chemical, crab-picking, and aluminum plants. For centuries, oyster farming has been a mainstay of the surrounding economy. However, in December 2009, commercial harvesting was suspended after the norovirus was discovered in several exported crops, resulting in a recall.

He studied initially in Ohrid, then in the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki, but moved with his family in 1890 in Bulgaria, where Voydan graduated from the First Male High School in Sofia. Here he became a member of the Young Macedonian Literary Association. Later Chernodrinski studied law in Austria and Switzerland, but failed to graduate and moved back to Ottoman Macedonia, where he worked as Bulgarian teacher. Afterward he returned to Bulgaria and became a head of the traveling troupe \\"Grief and comfort\\" () (Skrb I Uteha), founded in 1901 and renamed in 1902 as \\"Macedonian Capital Theater\\" (). In Sofia he wrote the most famous of his works, the play Macedonian Bloody Wedding (Makedonska KƒÉrvava Svadba). Voydan reworked it later to give the plot and the libretto for the famous opera \\"Tsveta\\" by maestro Georgi Atanasov. After the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 Popgeorgiev moved with his traveling troupe back in Ottoman Macedonia. He was invited there by the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs with the support of Peyo Yavorov and assisted by the Bulgarian National Theater.–Æ—Ä–∞ –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∞, –û–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–∞–∑–Ω–∏—Ü–∏ –∏ –∑–∞–±–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ –≤ –°–æ–ª—É–Ω (–∫—Ä–∞—è –Ω–∞ XIX –∏ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–æ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –•–• –≤–µ–∫). –í –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è, –∫—É–ª—É—Ç—Ä–∞, –º–µ–¥–∏–∏. –Æ–±–∏–ª–µ–µ–Ω —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫ –≤ —á–µ—Å—Ç –Ω–∞ –ì–æ—Ä–∞–Ω –ë–ª–∞–≥–æ–µ–≤, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è: –ö–Ω–∏–≥–æ–ø–∏—Å, 2017. —Å—Ç—Ä. 135. During the Balkan wars he was mobilized into the Bulgarian Army. During the First World War Chernodrinski served as Bulgarian officer and created the \\"Soldier Songs\\" cycle. After the wars he continued with his theatrical activities in Bulgaria. Towards the end of 1922 he formed a new drama theater under the name \\"Ilinden\\". In the mid-30s, Aleksandar Shoumenoff, owner of the First Bulgarian Book Store in Granite City, USA, published part of the works of Chernodrinski. The text wasn't translated into English but his works and plays became popular among Macedono-Bulgarian emigration.

The numeral in the name came from it being originally organized and broadcast by WSB-TV channel 2. For most of its run, the telecast of the parade lasted two hours but in the later years was cut back to 90 minutes. It was preceded by a pre-show of either 30 minutes or an hour. The event was the largest televised Independence Day parade in the country. In recent years, the hosts were longtime news anchor Monica Kaufman (now Monica Pearson), and sportscaster Chuck Dowdle. The 2006 parade was the first to be broadcast in high definition The parade, which had been produced for WSB-TV by Argonne Parades since 1981, began in 1961 and ended its run in 2007. It ran south on Peachtree Street, then briefly northwest on Marietta Street, ending at Centennial Olympic Park. The latter part of the route was used since at least 2005. An estimated 250,000 people came to watch the parade each year, with another estimated 350,000 watching at home. Archival recordings of the parade from as early as 1958 are held by the Walter J. Brown Media Archives at the University of Georgia as part of the WSB-TV Collection. Other events on the day include fireworks at Lenox Square (billed as the largest in the Southeast), and at Centennial Olympic Park. The Peachtree Road Race also occurs early in the morning. In 2008, no parade was held; instead, a Salute 2 America Celebration stage presentation was performed; this parade, along with the fireworks presentation at Lenox Square, continues annually as of 2011.

Trochta was considered a staunch defender of ecclesial rights and privileges in Czechoslovakia which the communist regime had sought to limit and suppress; Pope Paul VI (who made Trochta a cardinal) labelled Trochta after his death as a \\"defender of the faith\\" due to his commitment in standing up for Church rights and beliefs. He was a prisoner of war during World War II and for the decades after was stopped from performing his ecclesial duties until the end of his life when he was permitted to do so. His cause for sainthood had been planned in his old diocese but plans to do so collapsed and it has been scrapped. There are still local initiatives to commence the process. Life =Education and priesthood= ≈†tƒõp√°n Trochta was born on 26 March 1905 as the eldest child to Frantisek (1880-1912) and Anna; he was baptized as \\"≈†tƒõp√°n Maria\\". He had at least one brother (Josef; b. 1913) and one sister (Anna; b. 1911) who were still alive at the time of his death. The Trochta's conditions grew worse with the death of his father in 1912. He was a Jun√°k scout in his childhood and he studied at the archbishopric high school in Kromeriz in Olomouc after doing grade school from 1911 to 1918. But he was forced to interrupt his studies to take care of their small farm after his mother fell ill with tuberculosis in 1920. Her recuperation meant he could head into Turin in 1922 where he joined the Salesians of Don Bosco in 1923 and made his profession on 24 September 1925. But he encountered difficulties in getting to Turin for he was robbed in Vienna leaving him with his ticket to Venice. It was in the train station at Venice that a tollman asked where he was heading to with Trochta explaining what had happened. The tollman bought him a new train ticket to send him to Turin and this remained a tale he often repeated to demonstrate the goodness of God. He underwent his theological and philosophical studies in the Salesian Philosophical Institute in Turin and the Salesian Athenaeum where he earned his doctorate in 1932 prior to his ordination. Trochta received his ordination to the priesthood in Turin in 1932 from Cardinal Maurilio Fossati. He was then sent to central Moravia where he taught religious education and there oversaw the construction of the Saint John Bosco church in Ostrava. In October 1932 he enlisted for civil service for a brief period. =Episcopate= Pope Pius XII later appointed him as the Bishop of Litomƒõ≈ôice on 27 September 1947. He received his episcopal consecration in Prague. During World War II he became a leader of resistance against the Nazis and was a known friend to Jews and communists during his time as a prisoner of war in the Mauthausen camp and the Dachau concentration camp. He had been subjected to harsh Gestapo interrogations at their Prague headquarters and then at the Prague Pankrac prison before being sent off to the Terezin concentration camp. He managed to flee from Mauthausen despite being wounded though was recaptured and sent to Dachau in December 1944. The U.S. troops liberated him and all other prisoners from the prison on 29 April 1945 at the war's end. He returned to Prague on 23 May 1945. He made an \\"ad limina apostolorum\\" visit to the pope in November 1948. The war's end saw him serve as the spokesman for the Czechoslovakian Episcopal Conference in their negotiations with the communist regime from 1948 until 1949 when the talks ended. From 1949 until 6 August 1968 he was impeded from exercising his pastoral duties. On 16 January 1953 the communist authorities arrested him and accused him of concocted charges of espionage and anti-state activities. On 23 June 1954 the supreme court sentenced him to two decades in prison (meaning he would be released in 1979) for serving as one of the Church's spies.Czechoslovakia: crossroads and crises, 1918-88 by Norman Stone and Eduard Strouhal, 1989 states that: \\"Bishop Trochta was tried on 22-23 June 1954. Recalling his various period of imprisonment long afterwards among friends, he said: 'Not even in Mauthausen were things so bad. The German concentration camps were not to be compared with ...\\" In June 1960 he was amnestied but was forbidden to resume his clerical activities which led him to work as a plumber and construction laborer. In February 1962 he suffered a heart attack (remaining in hospital until 1963) and so was allowed to still retain his position but retire from official duties in November 1962 to a home for priests in T√°bor in 1963 and then in Radvanov in 1964. In autumn 1968 he first met Pope Paul VI, who appreciated his work and witness. On 20 July 1969 the supreme court struck down his old conviction as a violation of his legal rights. Pope John XXIII had invited Trochta in 1962 to attend the Second Vatican Council but the Czech authorities did not grant him permission to travel to Rome. In November 1968 he went to Rome for his second \\"ad limina apostolorum\\" visit and on 23 November met with Paul VI in a private audience. He then met with old Salesian friends in Turin before returning home before Christmas on 22 December. In February 1969 he led a pilgrimage to Rome to commemorate the death of Saint Cyril and on 30 January 1971 met with Paul VI in another private audience. On 29 October 1972 he attended the beatification of Michele Rua and on 15 February 1973 met with Paul VI in another private audience. =Cardinalate= Pope Paul VI named Trochta as a cardinal in pectore on 28 April 1969 and the appointment was made public in on 5 March 1973; he was elevated as the Cardinal-Priest of San Giovanni Bosco in Via Tuscolana with the titular church being raised \\"pro hac vice\\". Agostino Casaroli delivered the news of his appointment to him on 5 March and Trochta was noted to have been surprised but received the news with considerable calm. On 6 April he arrived in Rome at the Leonardo da Vinci Airport where Casaroli and Cardinal Sebastiano Baggio greeted him. He received the red hat and title on 12 April 1973. Trochta made his formal installation in his new church on 15 April after having celebrated a 13 April Mass for the staff at L'Osservatore Romano. He met with Paul VI once again in a 14 April private audience and returned home to his diocese on 16 April. He attended the two synods with the first being from 11-28 October and the other from 30 September to 6 November 1971. =Death and funeral= Trochta died at 3:00pm on 6 April 1974 in Litomƒõ≈ôice. He suffered a severe stroke on the morning of 6 April and was rushed to hospital where he died after having never regained consciousness. Trochta had undergone an operation in March 1974 but a week later on 5 April a communist official named Dlabal came to see him in the morning for a quasi- interrogation. The drunken officer was threatening and insulting to the wearied cardinal throughout the six-hour interview (11:30am to 5:30pm). He had a restless night and the next morning a nurse found him in severe pain from a cerebral hemorrhage. There were 3000 people present for his 16 April funeral including the then-Archbishop Luigi Poggi and Cardinal Franz K√∂nig; the two Polish cardinals Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski and Karol J√≥zef Wojty≈Ça - the future Pope John Paul II - were also in attendance. The German cardinal Alfred Bengsch also attended. Failed beatification cause His cause for beatification was once a focus for the nation's episcopal conference around 2008 but after a period for preparation was scrapped. The spokesman for the Olomouc archdiocese Jiri Gracka said in 2017 that the cause had no chance of ever beginning since Trochta had been \\"discredited\\" and \\"he liked women\\". Bishop Enrico dal Covolo - himself a Salesian - supported opening the cause as late as 2010.

The site belongs to the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural resources and commemorates the place where Washington Duke founded the nation's largest early-20th-century tobacco firm, the American Tobacco Company. History Duke Homestead - Durham, NC The Duke Homestead was built about 1852 by Washington Duke, on a farm that was about in size when the American Civil War broke out. During the war, the property was, like many others, looted by Union Army. With little left beyond a small supply of tobacco, the family shifted from tobacco farming to tobacco processing, introducing cigarettes in 1881 to compete with loose- leaf tobacco. This property is where the Dukes did their early tobacco processing, eventually moving into downtown Durham in 1874. The Duke business was incorporated as the American Tobacco Company in 1890, and was the largest tobacco company in the world until an antitrust suit broke it up in 1911. In 1931, the farm was purchased by Duke University, and in 1966, the Duke Homestead was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service. It became a North Carolina State Historic Site in 1974, administered by the North Carolina State Division of Archives and History. Description Duke Homestead tobacco pack house The property now consists of more than of the original Duke lands, on which stand the original Duke Homestead and several barn-like \\"factory\\" structures in which the Dukes cured, processed, and packed their tobacco. The very first building in which they worked, a log barn, was destroyed by fire, and was reconstructed in 1931. Museum Today, the site is a museum where tourists can view the restored 1852 Duke Homestead with four furnished rooms, tobacco barns and various artifacts. The visitor center features the Tobacco Museum, with exhibits about tobacco farming, processing and the history of tobacco. Various readings and presentations are available in the Visitor Center.

Since 1947 the annual festival has been held to celebrate the Date Palm harvest in the Coachella Valley. The event is held in February on the Riverside County Fairgrounds. The Coachella Valley has about 250,000 date palms planted on approximately which produces 35,000,000 pounds of dates annually.The History Of Dates The agricultural industry is responsible for 95 percent of the nation's crop.Checking out the Coachella Valley - Palm Springs, California The Date Festival has more than 7000 exhibits and competitions related to the fruit. It has grown to feature musicians and comedians, a Date Festival Queen and her court, monster trucks and bull-riding. The Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival is located in Indio, California, a city in the Colorado Desert, approximately east from Los Angeles. History The Fair started as a festival to celebrate the end of the annual date harvest in the desert region, the major commercial date-producing area in the Western Hemisphere. Dates were an unknown commodity in the desert until 1903 when date palms were transplanted there from Algeria. By the early 1920s dates became a major crop for the area. Date groves in the Coachella Valley also became tourist attractions. With the popularity of the date gardens the idea was planted for the first Date Festival in 1921 to be held in Indio's city park. A second festival was held the following year. Some 16 years later a third Date Festival was held, this time under the name of the Riverside County Fair and the Coachella Valley Date Festival. The Indio Civic Club, under contract from the County Board of Supervisors, sponsored the event. That year there were 72 booths exhibited and attendance reached 5,000. It was also the first year the street parade was staged. In 1936 Western themes were in style and the Fair took on a Western theme complete with wiskerenos, cowboy hats, and rodeo events. In 1940 the County purchased the present fairgrounds. The original cost $10,000 and over the years later the grounds were expanded with the purchase of an additional including the date grove on the fairgrounds. Presently, the fairgrounds cover . When World War II started all fairs in California were halted. When the War ended, Robert M.C. Fullenwider was hired to manage the Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival. Fullenwider introduced an \\"Arabian Nights\\" theme tying in with the desert region and date industry. Besides 1942 to 1945, 2021 will see no fair happening caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It'll resume in 2022. Pageant A fair vendor selling dates at the festival during the 1950s Also, tying into this theme, the Fair has a scholarship pageant called \\"Queen Scheherazade\\". Students from Riverside County compete to win the scholarship money for continued education and act as the \\"good will\\" ambassador over the Fair.This name came from the story \\"1001 Nights\\". Early storytellers of Baghdad say that there was once a jealous king named Shahriyar, who dearly loved his beautiful wife. But, unfortunately, he discovered that she was unfaithful. So he promptly had her beheaded. The King vowed he would remarry and the morning following his wedding night his bride would be slain. The task of finding the King a new wife each day was turned over to the Grand Vizier (Chief of Police). It so happened that the Vizier was the father of two of the most beautiful women in the land-Scheherazade and Dunyazade. Shocked at what was happening to her sister citizens, Scheherazade begged her father to take her as a bride to the king. At first the Vizier refused, but Scheherazade argued that eventually her time would come. And so it was, that the king met \\"Scheherazade\\", a comedian and great storyteller. On their wedding night Scheherazade started the Tale of 1001 Nights, but she was unable to finish it. She promised to do so the next evening. Intensely interested, the king agreed. However, the next night, Scheherazade again stopped her story as it reached an exciting point. Again, the King agreed to a continuance. And so it went for 1001 nights, until the King fell deeply in love with Scheherazade and they lived happily ever after.

It was his first effort after his departure from folk-rock group the Byrds in 1966. Though the album was a critical success and it established Clark as a talented singer-songwriter, it appeared very close to the scheduled release date for the Byrds' album Younger Than Yesterday in both the United States and the United Kingdom, hampering its possibilities for commercial success. The musicians on the album include: former bandmates Chris Hillman and Michael Clarke; Wrecking Crew session musicians Glen Campbell, Jerry Cole, Jim Gordon, and Leon Russell; future Byrd Clarence White; and Clark's future collaborator Doug Dillard. The folk/country vocal duo the Gosdin Brothers added backing vocals, and subsequently received co-billing. Reissues The album was first reissued in the US in 1972, omitting \\"Elevator Operator\\" and with re-recorded vocals and remixed backing tracks designed to \\"soften\\" the sound, under the title Collector's Series: Early LA Sessions. The album's first compact disc reissue appeared in 1988 on the Edsel Records label (UK), using the original 1966 stereo mix. Two years later, CBS Special Products (US) elected to use the original mono master for their CD reissue, which added a previously-unreleased alternate mono mix of \\"Tried So Hard\\" as a bonus track. A repackage on the Columbia/Legacy imprint in 1991 was titled Echoes, and was (mostly) remixed, though closer to the sound of the original album than the 1972 Collector's Series: Early LA Sessions ‚Äì the most significant changes were the removal of vocal double-tracking and some extended song endings. Echoes altered the original album running order, added \\"The French Girl\\" (an Ian and Sylvia cover), \\"Only Colombe,\\" an acoustic demo of \\"So You Say You Lost Your Baby,\\" and several Clark-penned songs from early Byrds recordings (also remixed). Both the 1997 reissue on Edsel Records and the 2007 reissue on Sundazed Records (produced by Bob Irwin) restored the original album mix and track order, with the latter including a number of alternate takes from the album sessions.

Sociality is the degree to which individuals in an animal population tend to associate in social groups (gregariousness) and form cooperative societies. Sociality is a survival response to evolutionary pressures. For example, when a mother wasp stays near her larvae in the nest, parasites are less likely to eat the larvae. Biologists suspect that pressures from parasites and other predators selected this behavior in wasps of the family Vespidae. This wasp behaviour evidences the most fundamental characteristic of animal sociality: parental investment. Parental investment is any expenditure of resources (time, energy, social capital) to benefit one's offspring. Parental investment detracts from a parent's capacity to invest in future reproduction and aid to kin (including other offspring). An animal that cares for its young but shows no other sociality traits is said to be subsocial. An animal that exhibits a high degree of sociality is called a social animal. The highest degree of sociality recognized by sociobiologists is eusociality. A eusocial taxon is one that exhibits overlapping adult generations, reproductive division of labor, cooperative care of young, and‚Äîin the most refined cases‚Äîa biological caste system.  Presociality  Solitary animals such as the jaguar do not associate except for courtship and mating. If an animal taxon shows a degree of sociality beyond courtship and mating, but lacks any of the characteristics of eusociality, it is said to be presocial. Although presocial species are much more common than eusocial species, eusocial species have disproportionately large populations. The entomologist Charles D. Michener published a classification system for presociality in 1969, building on the earlier work of Suzanne Batra (who coined the words eusocial and quasisocial in 1966). Michener used these terms in his study of bees, but also saw a need for additional classifications: subsocial, communal, and semisocial. In his use of these words, he did not generalize beyond insects. E. O. Wilson later refined Batra's definition of quasisocial. Entry is linked to entries on each of the other terms, as Subsocial, Quasisocial, etc. = Subsociality = Subsociality is common in the animal kingdom. In subsocial taxa, parents care for their young for some length of time. Even if the period of care is very short, the animal is still described as subsocial. If adult animals associate with other adults, they are not called subsocial, but are ranked in some other classification according to their social behaviours. If occasionally associating or nesting with other adults is a taxon's most social behaviour, then members of those populations are said to be solitary but social. See Wilson (1971) for definitions and further sub-classes of varieties of subsociality. Choe & Crespi (1997)Choe, J.C. & B.J. Crespi. 1997. [Eds.] The evolution of Social Behavior in Insects and Arachnids. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. and Costa (2006)Costa JT. 2006. The other insect societies. Belknap: Harvard University Press. give readable overviews. Subsociality is widely distributed among the winged insects, and has evolved independently many times. Insect groups that contain at least some subsocial species are shown in boldface on a phylogenetic tree of the Neoptera:(Kluge 2005, Kluge 2010, Kluge 2012): = Solitary but social = The mouse lemur is a nocturnal, solitary-but-social lemur native to Madagascar. Solitary-but-social animals forage separately, but some individuals sleep in the same location or share nests. The home ranges of females usually overlap, whereas those of males do not. Males usually do not associate with other males, and male offspring are usually evicted upon maturity. Among primates, this form of social organization is most common among the nocturnal strepsirrhine species and tarsiers. Solitary-but-social species include mouse lemurs, lorises, and orangutans. Some individual cetaceans adopt a solitary but social behavior, that is, they live apart from their own species but interact with humans. This behavior has been observed in species including bottlenose dolphin, common dolphin, striped dolphin, beluga, Risso's dolphin, and orca. Notable individuals include Pelorus Jack (1888‚Äì1912), Ti√£o (1994‚Äì1995), and Fungie (1983‚Äì). At least 32 solitary-sociable dolphins were recorded between 2008 and 2019. = Parasociality = Sociobiologists place communal, quasisocial, and semisocial animals into a meta-class: the parasocial. The two commonalities of parasocial taxa are the exhibition of parental investment, and socialization in a single, cooperative dwelling. Communal, quasisocial, and semisocial groups differ in a few ways. In a communal group, adults cohabit in a single nest site, but they each care for their own young. Quasisocial animals cohabit, but they also share the responsibilities of brood care. (This has been observed in some Hymenoptera and spider taxa, as well as in some other invertebrates.) A semisocial population has the features of communal and quasisocial populations, but they also have a biological caste system that delegates labor according to whether or not an individual is able to reproduce. Beyond parasociality is eusociality. Eusocial insect societies have all the characteristics of a semisocial one, except overlapping generations of adults cohabit and share in the care of young. This means that more than one adult generation is alive at the same time, and that the older generations also care for the newest offspring.  Eusociality  Giant honey bees cover the honeycomb of their nest. Eusocial societies have overlapping adult generations, cooperative care of young, and division of reproductive labor. When organisms in a species are born with physical characteristics specific to a caste which never changes throughout their lives, this exemplifies the highest acknowledged degree of sociality. Eusociality has evolved in several orders of insects. Common examples of eusociality are from Hymenoptera (ants, bees, sawflies, and wasps) and Blattodea (infraorder Isoptera, termites), but some Coleoptera (such as the beetle Austroplatypus incompertus), Hemiptera (bugs such as Pemphigus spyrothecae), and Thysanoptera (thrips) are described as eusocial. Eusocial species that lack this criterion of morphological caste differentiation are said to be primitively eusocial. Two potential examples of primitively eusocial mammals are the naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole- rat (Heterocephalus glaber and Fukomys damarensis, respectively). Both species are diploid and highly inbred, and they aid in raising their siblings and relatives, all of whom are born from a single reproductive queen. They usually live in harsh or limiting environments. However, a study conducted by O'Riain and Faulkes in 2008 suggests that due to regular inbreeding avoidance, mole rats sometimes outbreed and establish new colonies when resources are sufficient. Eusociality has arisen among some crustaceans that live in groups in a restricted area. Synalpheus regalis are snapping shrimp that rely on fortress defense. They live in groups of closely related individuals, amidst tropical reefs and sponges. Each group has one breeding female; she is protected by a large number of male defenders who are armed with enlarged snapping claws. As with other eusocial societies, there is a single shared living space for the colony members, and the non-breeding members act to defend it. = Human eusociality = E. O. Wilson and Bert H√∂lldobler controversially claimed in 2005 that humans exhibit sufficient sociality to be counted as a eusocial species, and that this enabled them to enjoy spectacular ecological success and dominance over ecological competitors.

The Afghan version of the soup is more likely to have tomatoes or a tomato broth. It is topped with chaka (yogurt sauce) and dried/crushed mint leaves. =Iranian cuisine= There are more than 50 types of thick soup (ƒÅsh) in Iranian cooking, ash reshteh being one of the more popular types. Some other well known ƒÅsh include ash-e anar (pomegranate stew), ash-e-jo (barley stew), ash-e doogh, ash-e sak (spinach stew), ash-e torsh (beet/pickle stew). The Iranian variation of aush often is topped with a garnish (na‚Äôna dagh) of fried mint oil, garlic chips, and/or shallot chips.

In 2006, it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is known as a former company town, developed by Braden Copper Company for housing the workers (and their families) associated with the operations of El Teniente, the largest underground copper mine in the world. At the town's peak in 1960, some 16,000 people lived here. After the government acquired a majority interest in the mine, and even moreso after copper mining was nationalized in 1971, the government company moved workers into the valley. It built the Copper Highway to provide commuting access for them to the mine and related operations. While some buildings were demolished in the 1980s, others have now been renovated for contract workers, and restored as part of preservation of this historic site. The Chilean government designated it in 1998 as a National Monument. History The town was founded in 1906 by the Braden Copper Company as a company town to support extracting copper from the El Teniente mine. It was named after the company's first president, Barton Sewell. During the Great Depression, the Braden Copper Company became a subsidiary of Kennecott Copper Company. In 1917 the foundry or smelter was moved from Sewell to Caletones, where another town developed around it. Originally male workers lived in shared housing at Sewell, called colectivos. Later family housing was added. Playgrounds, plazas, shops, and a movie theatre were later developed. Pedestrians walked up and down vertical staircases to reach the different levels of the town. Streets ran horizontally and were unpaved because of severe winter conditions. There were no cars. On the west-facing side of Cerro Negro, a camp for foreign personnel developed. Ore was taken down the mountainside to Graneros, where it was loaded onto railway cars. The narrow gauge railway that connected Sewell to the nearby town of Rancagua, away, was under construction in 1906 and was completed in 1911.Sewell, also known as El Teniente, Chile The total distance covered was with an elevation change of . By 1915 a hospital, a fire department, and a social club had been built and established in Sewell. The buildings and homes were made out of timber, and painted bright colors such as yellow, red and blue. At its peak in 1960, it had more than 16,000 inhabitants. By 1918 the town housed more than 12,000 people. Sewell is known as the \\"City of Staircases\\". The town was built on terrain too steep for wheeled vehicles, around a large central staircase, called the Escalara Central, which was built from the railway station. All supplies had to be brought into the city via a narrow gauge railroad. Pueblo Hundido contained the living quarters, while below the ore body was El Establecimiento, which contained the concentrator, hydroelectric plant, and a tramway. On 8 August 1944, 102 people died in an avalanche when the slopes above the town failed. Additional, ever-present threats to the city included earthquakes, avalanches and explosions from mine operations.http://gosouthamerica.about.com/cs/southamerica/a/ChiSewell_2.htm In June 1945, 355 workers died in El Teniente mine from carbon monoxide poisoning, and another 747 were injured, because smoke spread through the mine from a fire outside. This disaster resulted in the government developing and adopting more safety regulations. =Decline= In 1967 the Kennecott Copper Corporation relinquished its sole ownership of the site when the Chilean government bought a 51% stake in the company. At this time, many people were moved from Sewell to Rancagua. The government built the Copper Highway for their commuting to the mine and related operations. In 1971 the mine was nationalised by the Allende government. In 1977, the state-owned CODELCO (Corporaci√≥n Nacional del Cobre de Chile) started moving more families out of Sewell into the valley. The company town had been active for more than seven decades, and supported the construction and exploitation of the largest underground mine in the world. CODELCO began demolition of buildings in the town. =Preservation= Numerous supporters argued to have the town preserved because of its significance to Chilean history and its unusual site in the Andes. Demolition was halted at the end of the 1980s. In 1998 the Chilean Government declared Sewell a National Monument. In 1999 Chile's College of Architects declared Sewell to be one of the country's 10 most important urban works. Nine books have been written about life at Sewell. In 2006 UNESCO designated it as a World Heritage Site, based on Chile's nomination and assessment of its significance. During the 1980s some of the remaining buildings were remodeled to house thousands of contract workers at the mine, but they were later moved out. Other buildings have been restored in order to preserve the nature of the original town. Some 50 restored buildings remain, and a history museum is housed in one of the structures.http://www.sewell.cl/html/historia/fr_historia.html CODELCO uses several buildings for offices. Now only the basic company facilities required for mining remain in the town. The area is not accessible by private vehicles. The government allows visitors only through tour operators from Santiago and Rancagua.

The sacred places are known as Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya, Ruwanwelisaya, Thuparamaya, Lovamahapaya, Abhayagiri Dagaba, Jetavanarama, Mirisaveti Stupa and Lankarama. They are situated in Anuradhapura, the capital of the ancient Anuradhapura Kingdom. The sacred city of Anuradhapura exerted a considerable influence on the development of architecture in the country during several centuries. The city is nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982, it lies 205 km north of the current capital Colombo in island's North Central Province, on the banks of the historic Malvathu Oya. According to the Mahavansa the sacred city was found around 350 BC by Pandukabhaya, the 1st king of the Anuradhapura kingdom and sixth since the arrival of Vijaya. It eventually become the principal shrines of Buddhism including the branch planted of the sacred fig tree, Bodhi tree from Bodhgaya, under which Siddharta attained spiritual enlightenment and supreme wisdom. The sacred tree brought there in the 3rd century BC during the second mission, led by Sangamitta, a Buddhist nun and daughter of Emperor Ashoka. The relics of Buddha have, moreover, shaped the religious topography of Anuradhapura, where the Thuparamaya was built by Devanampiya Tissa in the 3rd century BC to house the clavicle of Buddha, an important religious relic presented by Emperor Ashoka. The city's apogee was reached under the reign of Dutthagamani who, in 161 BC, defeated the South Indian invader Ellalan re-establishing Buddhism in the place of Brahminism and endowed the site with extraordinary monuments including the Mirisaveti Stupa, Ruwanwelisaya, and the Brazen Palace. The city flourished for 1,300 years, then was abandoned after an invasion in 993. Later hidden away in dense jungle for many years, the splendid site, with its palaces, monasteries and monuments, is now accessible once again. List of Atamasthana =Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi= Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. The oldest living tree in documented history of the world. Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is a Sacred Fig tree in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. It is said to be a sapling from the historical Bodhi tree under which Buddha became enlightened. It was planted in 288 BC and is said to be the southern branch of the Sri Maha Bodhi Bodhgaya India, also the oldest living human-planted tree in the world with a known planting date. The sacred tree brought by the Ven. Sangamitta, the sister of Ven. Arahath Mahinda who introduced Buddha's teachings into Sri Lanka. The area around the Sri Maha Bodhi, the Brazen Palace and Ruvanvelisaya dageba was once probably part of the Maha Vihara (Great Temple). The sacred bodhi tree is the oldest historically authenticated tree in the world, for it has been tended by an uninterrupted succession of guardians for over 2000 years, even during the periods of Indian occupation. The Uda Maluwa, 35 feet by 55 feet, is 35 feet above the ground. The wall was constructed during the reign of King Kirthi Sri Rajasingha, to protect it from wild elephants. The late Ven. Pallegama Rewatha Thera had planted the Pariwara Bo trees (accompanying Bo trees) to camouflage the Bodhi to pd to safeguard it from natural disasters such as strong winds and rains. All Sri Lankan Heads of State usually have sought the blessings of the Sri Maha Bodhi before commencing any important work. =Ruwanwelisaya= Ruwanwelisaya Chedi in the sacred city of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. The Ruwanwelisaya is a stupa in Sri Lanka, considered a marvel for its architectural qualities and sacred to many Buddhists all over the world. It was built by King Dutugemunu, who became lord of all Sri Lanka after a war in which the Chola King Elara, was defeated. It is also known as Mahathupa, Swarnamali Chaitya, Suvarnamali Mahaceti (in Pali) and Rathnamali Dagaba. Also King Dutugemunu didn‚Äôt live to see its completion of dageba but his final sight as he lay on his deathbed could be a false bamboo-and-cloth finish was placed around the dageba to show his ‚Äòcompleted‚Äô masterpiece. Today, after incurring much damage from invading Indian forces, it rises 55m, considerably less than its original height; nor is its form the same as the earlier ‚Äòbubble‚Äô shape. A limestone statue south of the great dageba is popularly thought to be of King Dutugemunu. =Thuparamaya= Thuparamaya dageba in Anuradhapura. Thuparamaya is a dageba in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. It is a Buddhist sacred place of veneration. Thera Mahinda, an envoy sent by King Ashoka himself introduced Theravada Buddhism and also chetiya worship to Sri Lanka. At his request King Devanampiyatissa built Thuparamaya in which was enshrined the collarbone of the Buddha. It is considered to be the first dagaba built in Sri Lanka following the introduction of Buddhism. This is considered the earliest monument, the construction of which was chronicled Sri Lanka. The name Thuparamaya comes from \\"stupa\\" and \\"aramaya\\" which is a residential complex for monks. Thuparama dageba is the oldest dageba in Sri Lanka ‚Äì indeed, probably the oldest visible dageba in the world. It was constructed by Devanampiya Tissa in the 3rd century BC and is said to contain the right collarbone of the Buddha. Its ‚Äòheap-of-paddy-rice‚Äô shape was restored in 1862 in a more conventional bell shape and to a height of 19m. The surrounding vatadage‚Äôs slender, capital-topped pillars, perhaps the dageba‚Äôs most unusual feature, enclose the structure in four concentric circles. Impressions on the dageba pediments indicate the pillars originally numbered 176, of which 41 still stand. Although some Sri Lankan scholars believe these once supported a conical wooden roof, there is no archaeological evidence for this theory, nor does it follow any known antecedent in South India, whose dagebas were the prototypes for virtually all Sinhalese dagebas. =Lovamahapaya= Lovamahapaya Lovamahapaya is a building situated between Ruvanveliseya and Sri Mahabodiya in the ancient city of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. It is also known as the Brazen Palace or Lohaprasadaya because the roof was covered with bronze tiles. It was originally built by King Dutugemunu more than 2000 years ago, but throughout the ages it was rebuilt many times, each time a little less grandiosely. There are remains of 1600 columns all that is left of this huge palace, archaeological evidence said to have had nine storeys and could accommodate around 1000 monks and attendants. The current stand of pillars (now fenced off) is all that remains from the last rebuild ‚Äì that of King Parakramabahu around the 12th century. =Abhayagiri Dagaba= The Abayagiri dageba in Anuradhapura. The Abhayagiri Dagaba is situated in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. It was built during the reign of King Wattagamini Abhaya (commonly known as King Valagamba). It is one of the most extensive ruins in the world and one of the most sacred Buddhist pilgrimage cities. Historically it was a great monastic centre as well as a royal capital, with magnificent monasteries rising to many stories, roofed with gilt bronze or tiles of burnt clay glazed in brilliant colours. To the north of the city, encircled by great walls and containing elaborate bathing ponds, carved balustrades and moonstones, stood \\"Abhayagiri\\", one of seventeen such religious units in Anuradhapura and the largest of its five major viharas. Surrounding the humped dagaba, Abhayagiri Vihara was a seat of the Northern Monastery, or Uttara Vihara. The 1st or 2nd century BC built Abhayagiri dageba (confused by some books and maps with the Jetavanarama), was the centrepiece of a monastery of 5000 monks. The name means ‚ÄòHill of Protection‚Äô or ‚ÄòFearless Hill‚Äô, another claim ‚ÄòGiri‚Äô was the name of a local Jain monk. The monastery was part of the ‚ÄòSchool of the Secret Forest‚Äô, a heretical sect that studied both Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism, also Chinese traveller Faxian (also spelt Fa Hsien) visited in AD 412. The dageba was probably rebuilt several times to reach its peak 75m height. It has some interesting bas-reliefs, including one near the western stairway of an elephant pulling up a tree. A large slab with a Buddha footprint can be seen on the northern side, and the eastern and western steps have unusual moonstones made from concentric stone slabs. =Jetavanaramaya= The Jetavanarama dageba in Anuradhapura. The Jetavanaramaya is a stupa, located in the ruins of Jetavana Monastery in the sacred world heritage city of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. King Mahasena (273-301 AD) initiated the construction of the stupa following the destruction of Mahavihara, his son Meghavanna resume the construction work of the stupa. A part of a sash or belt tied by the Buddha is believed to be the relic that is enshrined here. The archaeologists believe it may have the original height over 100m, but today is about 70m, and also this was a similar height to the Abhayagiri as well. When it was built, it was the third-tallest monument in the world, the first two being Egyptian pyramids. A British guidebook from the early 20th century calculated that there were enough bricks in the dageba‚Äôs brick core to make a 3m-high wall stretching from London to Edinburgh. Behind it stand the ruins of a monastery that could accommodate around 3000 monks, and one building has doorjambs over 8 m high which is still standing, with another 3 m underground. At one time, massive doors opened to reveal a large Buddha image. =Mirisaveti Stupa= 200 px The Mirisaveti Stupa is situated in the ancient city of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. King Dutugamunu built the Mirisaveti Stupa after defeating King Elara. After placing the Buddha relics in the sceptre, he had gone to Tisawewa for a bath leaving the sceptre. After the bath he returned to the place where the sceptre was placed, and it is said that it could not be moved. The stupa was built in the place where the sceptre stood. It is also said that he remembered that he partook a chilly curry without offering it to the sangha. In order to punish himself he built the Mirisavetiya Dagaba. The extent of this land is about 50 acres (20 ha). Although the king Kasyapa I and Kasyapa V renovated this, from time to time it was dilapidated. What stands today is the renovation done by the cultural Triangle Fund. =Lankarama= The Lankarama dageba. Lankarama is a stupa built by King Valagamba, in an ancient place at Galhebakada in the ancient kingdom of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. Nothing is known about the ancient form of the stupa, and later this was renovated. The ruins show that there are rows of stone pillars and it is no doubt that there has been a house built encircling the stupa (vatadage) to cover it. The round courtyard of the stupa seems to be 10 feet (3 m) above the ground. The diameter of the stupa is 45 feet (14 m). The courtyard is circular in shape and the diameter is 1332 feet (406 m).

In 1989 the PI- Calculus was created by Robin Milner and was very successful throughout the years. The PI Calculus is an extension of the extension of the process algebra CCS, a tool that has algebraic languages that are specific to processing and formulating statements. The PI Calculus provides a formal theory for modeling systems and reasoning about their behaviors. In the PI Calculus there are two specific variables such as name and processes. But it was not until 2002 when Shahram Rahimi decided to create an upgraded version of the PI- Calculus and call it the API Calculus. Milner claimed the detailed characteristics of the API Calculus to be its \\"Communication Ability, Capacity for Cooperation, Capacity for Reasoning and Learning, Adaptive Behavior and Trustworthiness.\\" The main purpose of creating this mobile advancement is to better network and communicate with other operators while completing a task. Unfortunately, the API Calculus is not perfect and has faced a problem with its security system. The language has seven features that was created within the device that the PI Calculus does not have. Since this program is so advanced by the way the software was created and the different abilities that are offered in the program, it is required to be converted to other programming languages so it can be used on various devices and other computing languages. Although the API Calculus is currently being used by various other programming languages, modifications are still being done since the security on the API Calculus is causing problems to users.  What Does It Do?  The API Calculus is the main demonstration for modeling migration, intelligence, natural grouping and security in agent-based systems. This calculus programming language is usually used in various other program languages such as Java. In Java, a famous programming language used by various corporations such as IBM, TCS, and Google, the API Calculus is commonly used to solve equations and programs involving calculus.  Features  The API Calculus has a wide variety of features those similar to the PI Calculus but has new and improved features such as: * accepts processes to be passed over communication links * natural grouping of mobile processes is addressed * features calculus dictionary * includes milieu - a level of abstraction that is between a single mobile agents (combination of computer software and data that is able to transfer from one computer to another independently and still able to work on the most recent computer that data was transferred to) and the device as a whole. It is a very restricted environment that involves zero or many agents or other milieus that work closely together to solve computer based problems. * ability of grouping together hosts ( a physical node - connection point - or software program ) and processes ( computer program that is running ) that are similar * contains different programming languages * knowledge units  Verification Strategy  The software language used throughout the API Calculus program is translated into two other different languages. It is first translated from API Calculus syntax to ATEL/ATL, then to MOCHA. The outcome of the translating module is like the step previously mentioned. # Input Module( receives API Calculus model ) # Translating Model ( converts API syntax to ATEL/ATL syntax ) # Model Verification ( MOCHA ) # Display Mode Transferring API syntax to ATEL/ATL requires coding transformation knowledge to successfully transfer.  Syntax  The API program has its own syntax that it follows in order to make the program run smoothly. The program is broken down into four main categories such as terms, processes, knowledge units, and milieu. The terms can be names, terms, facts, rules or functions that are assigned to variable names of the program. The process is the list of expressions used within the program to solve a calculus problem or equation. The knowledge units or commonly known as parameters are the facts and rules that can be used in order to solve the program. Lastly, the milieu is the ability to transfer computer data and information from one computer to another independently.  Flaws  The only flaw that the API Calculus has is the ability to not support a security system on mobile devices such as laptops. The problem is that is any outside source tries to enter the milieu is not allowed to enter because the API Calculus requires proof that is can be a trusted source.

Three ch√¢teaux have been located on the site since a hunting lodge was transformed into the first ch√¢teau for Princess Marguerite de Valois, favorite daughter of King Henry II, sister of Kings Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III and the first wife of King Henry IV, in the 16th century. The first ch√¢teau was extended and substantially reconstructed by Louis XV. Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette lived at this second ch√¢teau, and the first manned flight, in a hot air balloon, set off from the ch√¢teau in 1783. The old ch√¢teau was demolished in the 1920s to make room for substantial houses, including a new ch√¢teau built by Henri James de Rothschild, which is now part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's headquarters. Name The meaning of muette is not certain. In modern French, it denotes a mute woman. However, the name of the ch√¢teau may be derived from several words in the French language: *, a spelling which appears frequently up to the end of the 18th century and signifies a pack of deerhounds; *, the antler shed by stags in the autumn; or *, the moulting- period of hunting hawks. It is clear that the name was connected with the hunting-lodge in the Bois de Boulogne, which mediaeval French kings used when they hunted deer in the forest. History =First ch√¢teau= At the end of the 16th century, Charles IX had a royal hunting lodge on the site transformed into a small ch√¢teau for Marguerite de Valois (popularly known as Reine Margot), the first wife of Henry IV. Although their marriage was always rocky and eventually annulled, they became friends late in life and she was able to return to Paris and set up house in the ch√¢teau. Marguerite bequeathed her ch√¢teau to the little Dauphin, later Louis XIII, in 1606. From 1606 to 1792, the property remained part of the royal estates. In 1716, the ch√¢teau became the home of the Duchesse de Berry, Marie Louise Elisabeth d'Orl√©ans, daughter of the Duc d'Orl√©ans, Regent of France. Antoine Watteau decorated the rooms with chinoiserie. Tsar Peter the Great of Russia visited her here. When welcoming the Russian emperor, the Duchess appeared \\"stout as a tower\\" (‚Äúpuissante comme une tour‚Äù).E. de Barthelemy (ed.), Gazette de la Regence. Janvier 1715-1719, Paris, 1887, p.180 The royal princess had been nicknamed ‚ÄúJoufflotte‚Äù (‚Äúchubby‚Äù) because of her generous proportions. By the spring of 1717, her increasing corpulence had begun to cause her serious inconvenience so that she had given up hunting and sold her saddle-horses. But the prodigious quantities of food she devoured, washed down with champagne and strong liquors, were not the main cause for her enormous girth. Although a widow since 1714, the princess was visibly pregnant. Early July, Madame de Berry, who by then kept fully secluded in her castle at La Muette, was being ‚Äúinconvenienced‚Äù, ‚Äúhaving grown so big‚Äù that it was feared for her life ! By the end of July, the Duchess had recovered but she had been in critical condition a few days earlier when giving birthE. de Barthelemy (ed.), Gazette de la Regence. Janvier 1715-1719, Paris, 1887, pp.175-176, 192, 196... Which is why two months earlier, the princess, already quite heavy with child, had seemed \\"stout as a tower\\" in presence of Peter the Great. This clandestine pregnancy was really an open secret and had been widely gossiped about. Arouet (Voltaire) was arrested in May 1717 after telling to a police informer that the Regent's daughter had retired to La Muette to wait for the time of her delivery.Jean-Michel Raynaud, Voltaire soi-disant, Presses Universitaires de Lille, 1983, vol.1, p.289. After the death of her husband in 1714 and of the Sun King in 1715, the princess was said to have lost \\"all semblance of restrain in her quest for lustful pleasures\\". In January 1716, she had secretly borne a girl at her Luxembourg palace. Satirical songs had then lampooned her licentious amours.Emile Raunie (ed.), Chansonnier historique du XVIII√®me si√®cle: recueil Clairambault-Maurepas, Paris, 1880, pp.36-38 Unable to recover from a difficult delivery, the Duchess expired on 21 July 1719 in the ch√¢teau de la Muette Berry had almost died while being delivered of a still-born daughter on 2 April at the Luxembourg palace. She didn't recover from her excruciating delivery but quickly fell pregnant again, as shown by her autopsy. Berry's premature end is vividly described in The Memoirs of the Duke of Saint-Simon on the reign of Louis XIV and the Regency, chapter XXIII, pp. 206-220. =Second ch√¢teau= La Muette in the time of Louis XV On the Duchesse de Berry's death in 1719, the ch√¢teau passed to the nine-year-old king, Louis XV. The king used the ch√¢teau to entertain his mistresses, including the three de Nesle sisters, Madame de Pompadour and Madame du Barry. Louis XV had the ch√¢teau entirely rebuilt by the architects Jacques V Gabriel and Ange-Jacques Gabriel between 1741 and 1745. The new, much larger, building was flanked by two large wings with many smaller outlying buildings. The Dauphin, later King Louis XVI, took possession of La Muette in 1764, and his future wife, Marie-Antoinette, lodged there on her arrival in France. Fran√ßois Boucher, Arion on the Dolphin, 1748, Princeton University Art Museum, intended as an overdoor in the chateau =Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette= Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria visits Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI on 7 February 1775 at the Ch√¢teau de la Muette (painting by the Austrian portraitist Josef Hauzinger) Louis XVI is said to have spent the happiest days of his life at the ch√¢teau with his young bride, although they had no knowledge of sexual matters and thus did not have children for seven years. During this period Louis abolished certain royal taxes, and he opened the gates of the Bois de Boulogne to the populace. The Emperor Joseph II, Marie- Antoinette's brother (travelling incognito under the name of \\"Count Falkenstein\\") visited the couple here in April 1777. Louis granted a small area of sandy ground of the ch√¢teau's estate at les Sablons (near les Sablons metro station) to Antoine-Augustin Parmentier (1737‚Äì1813) to demonstrate the growing of potatoes, which had not previously been considered in Europe, other than in Ireland, as safe for human consumption. Indeed, they were considered to be a source of leprosy among other things. Parmentier carried out a series of publicity stunts, which led to the acceptance of potatoes in France and then throughout Europe. The ch√¢teau, together with the Ch√¢teau de Madrid and other properties, were put on sale in February 1788, with a view to demolition. The castle fell into disrepair, and the main building was demolished in 1793. =Montgolfier brothers= A model of the Montgolfier brothers balloon at the London Science Museum. The first manned flight commenced from the ch√¢teau on 21 November 1783, with a hot air balloon manufactured by the Montgolfier brothers lifting off from the garden of La Muette carrying Pil√¢tre de Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlandes. Among the crowd who observed this feat were the royal family and Benjamin Franklin. They flew for 25 minutes, travelling almost 300 metres above Paris and covering a distance of about nine kilometres, before landing between the windmills on the Butte-aux-Cailles. Enough fuel remained on board at the end of the flight to have allowed the balloon to fly four to five times as far. However, burning embers from the fire were scorching the balloon fabric and had to be extinguished with sponges, and so the pilots decided to land as soon as they were over open countryside. =Post revolutionary history= During the French Revolution, the Ch√¢teau de la Muette became state property. The property was split up into several lots and sold at auction. The ch√¢teau returned to the royal family in 1816. One wing was given to the Minister for Finance, Louis Emmanuel Corvetto. The other wing, and most of the grounds, were purchased in 1820 by S√©bastien √ârard, who manufactured pianos used by Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Franz Liszt. In 1821, S√©bastien √ârard invented the double escapement action, which permitted a note to be repeated even if the key had not yet risen to its maximum vertical position, a great benefit for rapid playing. In 1912, the ch√¢teau's then owner, the Franqueville family, sold much of the remaining property, and the former estate developed into a fashionable residential area. =Third ch√¢teau= Rothschild's ch√¢teau in 2019 Two large lots were sold to Baron Henri James de Rothschild, who built a new ch√¢teau in 1921 and 1922 as his Paris residence to a 19th-century design by Lucien Hesse. By the beginning of World War II, the old ch√¢teau had been completely demolished and replaced by mansions. The new ch√¢teau was appropriated by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during the Second World War. During the Liberation of Paris in August 1944 the ch√¢teau was captured after a brief gunfight by the British '30 Assault Unit' keen on gathering vital intelligence. In late 1945 United States Army took over the buildings to organise operations in the aftermath of the war. In 1949, it became the headquarters of the Organization for European Economic Co- operation (OEEC) set up under the Marshall Plan to help administer funds provided by the United States to promote post-war recovery and to encourage European economic cooperation. The OEEC developed into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1961, with the new Ch√¢teau de la Muette as its headquarters. The \\"Rue Andr√© Pascal\\" street on which the cour d'honneur of the ch√¢teau opens is named after one of the pseudonyms under which Henri de Rothschild published his literary works.

This type of roaning only occurs in conjunction with the Leopard complex. Varnish roans are born with a dark base coat color, usually with some spotting. As the horse ages, white hairs increase over most of the body, and many spotted markings blur or fade. The varnish roan pattern often appears to spread from the white of any original markings. This color pattern is best known in the Appaloosa breed of horse. Varnish roan is not a result of the roan or the Gray gene, but part of the Leopard complex. A horse may have varnish roan coloration in conjunction with other leopard patterns. Characteristics By adulthood, the varnish roan usually has a base coat of intermingled dark and white hairs, though more white hairs than dark, with mottled skin, color mainly on the cheeks of the face, and around the knees. The darker areas remain at bony points (on the face, usually in a distinct V on the bridge of the nose; on the cheeks, point of shoulder, elbows, knees, point of hips, hock) and it can be seasonal as well. Although classic roans are roan from birth, varnish roans are often born with spots and \\"roan out\\" as they age. A horse's appearance can change almost completely, although the original markings are usually visible. The pattern is not completely stable. The horse is born another color (usually another leopard pattern), and the Varnish pattern gradually overtakes it by adulthood. After the horse is mature, the coat color may lighten slightly when the horse has a long winter coat, and darken slightly in the summer when the winter coat sheds out. However, unlike the gray gene, the color does not get progressively lighter every year for the life of the horse, though it may look a bit different from year to year while the horse is young. Varnish vs true roan The varnish roan is not a true roan, it is actually one of the leopard complex coat patterns associated with Appaloosa, Knabstrupper, Noriker horse and related breeds. Varnish roans are not true roans and can be distinguished from true roans by the following: * Leopard complex characteristics. Varnish roans, like all horses with the Lp gene, have mottled skin, striped hooves, and white sclera. * Varnish roans change color seasonally, often becoming less spotted as they age, and often having their coats become lighter when a winter coat grows in, though they do not progressively lighten in the manner of a gray horse. * Bony areas retain their pigment longer. These areas include the bridge of the nose and cheekbones, ears, points of shoulder and stifle, as well as the legs. * Appaloosa characteristic parentage. Genetics Varnish roan is thought to occur due a single, simple dominant gene on equine chromosome 1 (ECA1). It also appears that specific white patterning genes produce the assorted blanket, leopard, and snowflake coat patterns. Without these white patterning factors, horses with one or two copies of the dominant Lp gene are \\"varnish roans.\\" Varnish roans can be considered to have many, many very small leopard spots that reflect the mottling of the underlying skin. A horse may be varnish roan as well as true roan and gray, but such combinations are extremely uncommon. The breeding of grays is discouraged by the Appaloosa Horse Club and not allowed by Knabstrupper breed registry.

Formative years The son of Jadab Chandra Roy Kabibhusan, he was born at Shantipur in Nadia. He lost his father at the age of twelve and had his early education in the traditional centres of education, the tols and pathasalas. When he went to Kolkata to study in Sanskrit College, he came under the influence of Debendranath Tagore and Keshub Chunder Sen and joined the Brahmo movement. Initiated into the Brahmo movement by his fellow-villager Bijoy Krishna Goswami, he was amongst the first apostles of the Brahmo Samaj, who took up its banner in the midst of bitter persecution and great privations.Sastri, Sivanath, pp. 87‚Äì88 A strict vegetarian in his personal life, he devoted much of his time to prayers. Aghore Nath married a child widow of a different caste in 1863. Missionary work Braja Sundar Mitra had bought a house in Armeniatola in Dhaka in 1857 and started a Brahmo Samaj there.Sastri, Sivanath, p. 394 He started a Brahmo School there in 1863. Aghore Nath joined the school as a missionary teacher and stayed there for about ten months. Amongst those who were influenced by him to join the Brahmo Samaj were Banga Chandra Roy and Bhuban Mohan Sen. It was during this period that the two brothers Kali Mohan Das and Durga Mohan Das visited Dhaka and created a stir with their speeches. Keshub Chunder Sen visited Dhaka in 1865 and with the growing influence of the Brahmo Samaj, persecution increased manifold.Sastri, Sivanath, p. 396 In his earlier days, Aghore Nath was a missionary of the Adi Samaj.

From there he proceeded on a missionary tour of Tipperah and Chittagong.Sastri, Sivanath, pp. 134‚Äì135 Later, he went to Munger, where subsequently Keshub Chunder Sen launched a major bhakti (devotional) movement.Sastri, Sivanath, p. 143 He was the first Brahmo missionary to venture into Assam (in 1870)Sastri, Sivanath, p. 518 and had worked in OdishaSastri, Sivanath, p. 521 and Punjab.Sastri, Sivanath, p. 447 With the second schism of the Brahmo Samaj in 1878 and the formation of the Navavidhan or the New Dispensation in 1869, Aghore Nath was ordained as an apostle of the New Dispensation for the Punjab in 1881.Ghosh, Nirvarpriya, The Evolution of Navavidhan, 1930, p141, Navavidhan Press. However he died the same year under rather tragic circumstances. He had travelled to Punjab on a mission tour but had to give up because of failing health. Afflicted with diabetes, then a killer disease, he went to Lucknow, where his elder brother took care of him until he died.Sastri, Sivanath, p. 248 Erudition In 1869, Keshub Chunder Sen selected from his missionaries four persons and ordained them as adhypaks or scholars of the four major religions of the world.

It was built in the beginning of the 15th century by Jan of Czernina. At the end of the 17th century, Italian architects Joseph Simon Bellotti and Pompeo Ferrari erected the present Baroque castle on its ancient foundations. The first owners of the castle were the Leszczy≈Ñski family. Together with a park and surrounding areas, it was one of the most splendid palaces in Great Poland.  Italian Heritage  The residence was built by Giuseppe Simon Belotti from Lugano, at the end of the 17th century. Not only was he an architect but also a manager of stucco workshops and a supervisor of decorative works made by Italian plasterers and sculptors. Belotti designed the Leszczy≈Ñskis‚Äô Palace in ‚Äòpalazzo in modo fortezza‚Äô style, following the example of Poggio Reale by Sebastiano Serlio (Serliano). Another Italian artist who settled in Poland, Michelangelo Palloni from Florence, decorated ceilings in the palace in Rydzyna with splendid frescos. At the beginning of the 18th century, Pompeo Ferrari came to Rydzyna. He was a talented architect from Rome, laureate of the St. Lucas Academy. He settled here for the rest of his life and after his death in 1736 was buried in the parish church. Pompeo Ferrari designed the Rydzyna palace reconstruction which was the beginning of the famous urban planning of Rydzyna, whose aim was to join the palace and the town in a harmonious composition. Apart from that he was a designer of other magnificent buildings in Wielkopolska (Great Poland). Other artists under the artistic patronage of the Leszczy≈Ñski family were three brothers Catenazzi from Morbio Inferiore in Mendrisiotto, (in Ticino, Switzerland). The splendid heritage of the past has been carefully protected in Rydzyna, where people always remember creators of beauty.  Leszczy≈Ñski Residence  Inerior of the castle From 1704‚Äì1709 it was the residence of Polish king Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski. In 1709, during the Great Northern War, the castle was partly burnt by the tsar's soldiers. However, wall-paintings and stucco works in the representative rooms, made by Italian artists, were not destroyed completely. After this period Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski was forced to abdicate the Polish throne and was exiled to France. After years, as Duke of Lorraine, he became a famed as a charitable and wise sovereign. His daughter Maria became queen of France and was the grandmother of King Louis XVI.  Su≈Çkowski Residence  Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski sold his estates in Poland to Aleksander Joseph Su≈Çkowski. The new owner improved the castle. The Silesian architect Karl Martin Frantz changed roofs, added Rococo decorations and the monumental main gate. He also rebuilt the parish church and the town. The son of Aleksander Joseph, Prince August, continued the expansion. Classical ornamentation was added to the Ballroom. The outbuildings and Orangerie were added to the north of the palace. At the end of the 18th century, the residence of the Su≈Çkowski princes, with open-air theater and high school of Piarist Fathers, was the most important cultural and educational center in Great Poland. Under Prussian Rule After the second partition of Poland in 1793, the architectural development in Rydzyna ceased. Two of the Su≈Çkowskis of Rydzyna were covered with glory: brave and talented Joseph Su≈Çkowski, the aide-de-camp of Napoleon, killed in action at Cairo and his cousin Anthony Paul - the fourth Su≈Çkowski owner of Rydzyna - whose name is inscribed on the Arch de Triomphe in Paris. The last Prince Su≈Çkowski died childless in 1909. The Castle was taken over by Prussian authorities. In 1919 the Versailles Treaty gave it back to Poland. Rydzyna Castle after 1919 In accordance with the statutes of the Su≈Çkowski family that had been established by Prince August in 1775 with the approval of the Polish Parliament, the Educational Foundation of the Su≈Çkowski family was restored in 1924. In 1928 boarding school for boys- the Su≈Çkowski School, was established under the direction of professor Tadeusz ≈Åopuszanski, who had very interesting and innovative ideas about education. World War II until present day During the German occupation, 1939‚Äì1945, a \\"Hitlerjugend\\" (see National Political Institutes of Education) school was placed in the castle. At the end of January 1945 the Castle in Rydzyna was burnt by the Red Army. The severely damaged Castle awaited a new owner until 1970, when was taken over by The Association of Polish Mechanical Engineers (S.I.M.P.) and rebuilt according to documents and photographs from before World War II. The work was completed in 1989. In 1994 the castle was awarded by the prestigious international organization Europa Nostra in recognition of the excellence of the restoration work. Original equipment and furnishing from the Castle were lost before World War I. The main Baroque rooms were completely restored to their original grandeur according to the historic documentation. In the castle collections there are: old furniture, historical drawings, remembrances of the Su≈Çkowski family, nature collections e.g.: tropical butterflies, hunting trophies. In the library one can find documentation connected with the previous owners of the Castle, The Su≈Çkowski Grammar School and The Association of Polish Mechanical Engineers.

Indecision is known for their song \\"Hallowed be Thy Name\\". The song features the lyric \\"For those I love, I will sacrifice\\" that fans across the world have turned into a tattoo. Photographer Laura Rauch took a photograph of the tattoo on the ribs of a 19-year-old US Army Infantryman named Kyle Hockenberry who was being treated in a medevac helicopter following an explosion that cost him both of his legs and one arm. The photo was taken for a military newspaper and went on to win an award from the Society of Professional Journalists. The lyric subsequently gained popularity with members of the armed forces. Winston McCall, the lead vocalist and lyricist of Australian metalcore band Parkway Drive also has one half of the lyric tattooed down each of his forearms.  History  The band members‚Äîguitarist Justin Brannan, drummer Pat Flynn, bassist Steve Bago and vocalist Tom Sheehan (who was replaced by Artie Phillie in 1998)  met while attending Xaverian High School in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. The band added second guitarist Rachel Rosen after having met her while performing live on her infamous WNYU radio show, Crucial Chaos, in 1996. Initially Indecision played mostly in local clubs. Over time, a lot of the venues in their neighborhood closed down, which prompted them to take a larger step and lead to the bands integration into the New York City hardcore scene. In the early days, the band would often show up to gigs all in one car, with their equipment tied to the roof with Bungee cords. Justin Brannan recounts these early days in the liner notes to A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall:Justin Brannan, Linear Notes of the CD \\"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall\\", 1998 > Fort Hamilton High School Auditorium in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, New York. The > infamous \\"Battle of the Bands\\". Our first show as Indecision.

[...] The band was first noticed for its insane live shows at The Wetlands Preserve. Indecision, being a relatively new band at the time, would often open up the Sunday matinees. After they had finished their set, the club would quickly empty out. This only added to their mystique and quickly built a cult following.  Touring  Relentless recording and touring kept the band relevant long after many of their contemporaries faded away. Inspired by bands like Black Flag, Indecision embarked on voracious trailblazing tours, and it became their trademark usually spending a solid 9 to 10 months a year on the road. They were dubbed \\"The Working Man's Band\\" for their affinity to tour cities and countries that other bands wouldn't dare. Indecision was the first American band to play in Croatia (Zagreb) after the Croatian War of Independence ended in 1995 Indecision also showed its appreciation for its home Brooklyn as well as New York City‚Äîwhich they regularly labeled \\"Gotham City\\" on merchandise . The former Indecision-members Justin and Rachel are now in the hardcore band Most Precious Blood on Trustkill Records. = Records and labels = The band released their first recording in 1993 on a 7-inch released by R.P.P., a then small Belgian hardcore label. Over the next 7 years, Indecision would tally over a dozen 7-inch singles on a number of different labels, including many limited color vinyl and special edition covers. The band got known on a very grassroots word-of-mouth level from New York City to Thailand, where Indecision remains one of the most popular underground American bands to this day. In 1996 they signed with WreckAge/Exit Records family and would release 3 albums with the label over the next 3 years: \\"Unorthodox\\", \\"Most Precious Blood\\" and \\"To Live and Die in New York City\\", all of which showed off their slightly metal-tinged brand of thought- provoking hardcore (which managed to express anger and injustice without being hateful).  To Live and Die in New York City  In 1998, \\"To Live and Die in New York City\\" was their first album to feature the polarizing Artie Phillie on vocals (whom the band befriended and poached from noise-crust-punk labelmates, Milhouse), but the album retained the straight-ahead style that their other releases possessed. The album featured an eerily prophetic manipulated photo of the Manhattan skyline engulfed in flames. The song \\"Purgatory\\" features an audio sample about the Union Carbide tragedy in Bhopal, India. In December 1984, a gas leak at a Union Carbide India Limited plant in Bhopal, India, results in tragic loss of life in what is known as the Bhopal disaster, when up to 20,000 people lost their lives.  Release the Cure  In 1999, they tried their luck at another label, putting out Release the Cure on M.I.A. Records (and on Overcome Records in Europe). This, arguably their most highly acclaimed album, would be their last. The lyrical content was notably more socio-political with songs questioning the government and health care and conspiracy theories in regard to AIDS and cancer research. It was the first album recorded with full songs with singer Artie...formerly of the band Milhouse. Tom Sheehan was singer previous and now for MOst Precious Blood  History  = Controversy = Indecision was notoriously outspoken. Most of their album art and merchandise was somehow controversial. The band always claimed it wasn't done maliciously or hatefully, but to \\"stir-up a dialogue and inspire free-thought and discussion.\\" = Touring disasters: The \\"Indecision Curse\\" = The band's tour stories have become legendary. During their first European tour in 1997, after having played a show in Wels in front of a handful of people at an indoor skate park with Flatline and Racial Abuse the band was stopped at the Austrian border on their way to Zagreb. The members were strip searched and held for hours, while the van was disassembled by the customs officials. Another incident happened on the last day of a tour in Quebec in 1999, when they had all their money and merchandise seized. A follow-up to \\"Release The Cure\\" was in the works and tentatively entitled \\"The Curse\\" but the band broke up before anything was recorded. =Breakup = Indecision disbanded after a show in El Paso, Texas, while on tour with Kill Your Idols on June 7, 2000.

Baxley, and starring Lisa Brenner, Steven Brand, and Tsidii Le Loka. It is a prequel to the miniseries Rose Red (2002), and is based on the 2001 novel by Ridley Pearson, which itself is an accompaniment piece to the miniseries.  Plot  The miniseries is an adaptation of The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red (2001), written by Ridley Pearson under the pseudonym Joyce Reardon, PhD. Pearson's novel was based on the script of Stephen King's Rose Red. The plot revolves around the construction of the Rimbauer mansion, Rose Red, in Seattle, Washington, tracing a series of mysterious accidents throughout the mansion's early history which cause it to become cursed. Set at the turn of the 20th century, the stately, sinister mansion is constructed by powerful Seattle oil magnate John Rimbauer (Steven Brand) as a wedding present for his timid, submissive young bride, Ellen (Lisa Brenner). Rimbauer uses much of his wealth to build the mansion in the Tudor neo-Gothic style and situate it on of woodland. The site has been a Native American burial ground. The house appeared cursed even as it was being constructed: three construction workers are killed on the site, and a construction foreman is murdered by a co-worker. Shortly after her marriage to Rimbauer, Ellen begins keeping a diary in which she confesses her anxieties about her new marriage, expresses her confusion over her emerging sexuality, and contemplates the nightmare that her life is becoming. Ellen soon has two children which helps soothe her painful relationship with her husband. First, a boy named Adam, and then a girl (born with a deformed withered arm) named April. At first impressed by her husband's extravagance, Ellen eventually hates and fears John, especially when learning unsavory facts about his past. Meanwhile, the number of individual hauntings in the mansion increases, possibly including ghosts of the many people close to John who have mysteriously vanished. Ellen interprets the eerie manifestations as a warning that she, too, may some day disappear without a trace. Years after her young daughter April also vanishes inside the estate, Ellen and her maid and confidant Sukeena still continue to live in the house. After John's death, Ellen believes that if she continues to build the house, she will never die. She uses nearly all of her inherited fortune to continually add to the home over the next several decades, enlarging it significantly. Rose Red begins growing by itself, adding new hallways, new corridors, new rooms and new staircases seemingly overnight. But mysterious disappearances continue: Deanna Petrie, a famous actress friend of Ellen's, and Sukeena both disappear over the next few years. Ellen herself disappears in 1950, never to be seen again.

Beginning with a saddlery business, he founded Phelps, Dodge & Co. in 1833 as an export-import business with his sons-in-law William E. Dodge and Daniel James based as partners in Liverpool, England. His third son-in-law (and grandson) James Boulter Stokes, became a partner some years later. Later in the 19th century after the senior Phelps' death (22 years), Phelps Dodge acquired mining interests and companies in the American West, and became known primarily as a mining company.  Early life  Anson Green Phelps was born in Simsbury, Connecticut, in 1781; his mother died when he was 12 years old. Afterward, he was raised in the house of the Congregational minister of Simsbury. Phelps was descended from the early American colonial governors Thomas Dudley, John Haynes and George Wyllys. On October 13, 1799, he chose a relative, Thomas Woodbridge Phelps, as his guardian. On May 5, 1799, Thomas Woodbridge Phelps and Anson Green Phelps were admitted to the Congregational Church in South Canton, Connecticut, which was led by Reverend Jeremiah Hallock. In his early adulthood, Anson Phelps left Simsbury and settled in Hartford, Connecticut.  Career  After moving to Hartford, Phelps began manufacturing saddles and shipping them to the South. His business grew rapidly. He had a large brick building constructed on North Main street, which became known as the \\"Phelps Block.\\" In 1812 he moved to New York City and began doing business with Elisha Peck under the firm name of Phelps, Peck & Co. in the United States. In Liverpool, England, where Peck managed it, the firm was known as Peck, Phelps & Co. They dealt in metal imports from England including tin, tin plate, iron, and brass; and exported cotton from the South to the textile mills in England. Such cotton trade was highly important to England and contributed to its considering support for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Fellow businessman Sheldon Smith persuaded Phelps to invest in the growing town of Derby, Connecticut, in an area that came to be known as Birmingham. Unable to grow his business farther north, Phelps selected a location on the east bank of the Naugatuck River in what is now downtown Ansonia. Ansonia was first settled in 1652 and named in honor of Anson Phelps. The state chartered Ansonia as a borough of Derby in 1864, and later as a separate town in 1889. In 1893, Ansonia incorporated as a city, consolidating with the boundaries of the town. Phelps' business continued to prosper and he accumulated a large fortune. His original partnership with Peck was dissolved in 1832 following the destruction of their New York warehouse (4 May 1832) due to structural failure. Phelps and his son narrowly escaped, but among the dead was Josiah Stokes, a senior clerk who was betrothed to Phelps daughter, Caroline. This was a terrible blow to Phelps and his family. He reorganized the business, forming the Phelps Dodge Company in 1833 with his sons-in-law William Earl Dodge and Daniel James as partners. The two of them operated the firm's functions in Liverpool, England. In 1839 Phelps made his son Anson G. Phelps, Jr. a partner, with a one-eighth share of the business. Caroline Phelps eventually married James Boulter Stokes, brother of the dead Josiah. He became the third son-in-law of Phelps to join Phelps, Dodge & Co. as a partner. Stokes was wealthy in his own right. During the 1837 financial crisis, he helped the Phelps, Dodge partnership through a difficult time with a loan. Phelps' business interests included banking, property, mining, ironworks, shipping, railroads and timber. After the split with Peck, some of these interests were divided between the two men. Others remained in joint partnership, including the New York property portfolio and shipping. Peck, who took over the rolling mill at Haverstraw, would continue to purchase raw materials from Phelps. Philanthropic interests Phelps continued to be an active member of the Congregational Church, and he took an interest in a number of philanthropic causes. He contributed generously to the American Bible Society, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the American Home Missionary Society, the Colonization Society, the Blind Asylum of New York City, and served as the president of each at some point during his life. He also contributed to many other societies and charitable institutions both while he lived and through his estate. He gave his native town of Simsbury, Connecticut US$1000 to aid the poor. Among his other philanthropic activities was the creation of the Anson G. Phelps lecture series on early American history at New York University. In the 1830s, Phelps supported Presbyterian preacher Charles Grandison Finney during his ministry in New York. Phelps first hired a church for him in Vanderwater Street, and later purchased a church in Princes Street, near Broadway. Finney was \\"much struck with the piety of Mr Phelps\\", and said that Phelps would rise at night so that he could commune with God, having little time for secret devotion during the day, when business pressed him.  Family  Phelps married Olivia Egleston, daughter of Elihu and Elizabeth Egleston, on 26 October 1806 at the age of 25. He and Olivia had nine children: Elizabeth, Melissa, Caroline Olivia (died in infancy), and Caroline, all born in Hartford; and Harriett, Anson Green Jr., Olivia Egleston, and Lydia Ann, all born in New York City. His grandsons included Anson Phelps Stokes and William Earl Dodge Stokes. His great- grandson, Anson Phelps Stokes, became a well-known philanthropist. In 1835 Phelps purchased the house of Henry A. Coster and added land to extend the property from Third Avenue to the East River, and from Twenty-ninth to half- way between Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth streets.  Death and bequests  Phelps died at his New York residence, formerly the Coster place, on 30 November 1853 at age 73. He left about two million dollar, of which almost seven hundred thousand was his shares in Phelps Dodge & Co. These were purchased by the other partners. Just over one million dollars was property in New York, Indiana, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Missouri. His will was contested and there were so many anomalies that his widow, who was the executrix, put it before the courts to sort out. It was after her death that the final verdict was given by the court of appeal in 1861. Due to a technical issue with the wording of the will, one large bequest of $50,000 to the Liberia College was declared void by the courts. However, the family held this bequest to be sacred and the donation stood despite the ruling. He was eulogized by a Mrs. Sigourney in writing: In his will, Phelps left instructions to his heirs in terms that characterized his life: His funeral was at the Presbyterian Church, Mercer Street, New York, where he had been a ruling elder. He was buried in his family vault in the New York Marble Cemetery. He was later re-interred in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

It is believed to have been written by Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan in the early 17th century, and is considered to be a classic of Malayalam literature and an important text in the history of Malayalam language. It is a retelling of the Sanskrit work Adhyatma Ramayana in kilippattu (bird song) format. Ezhuthachan used the Grantha-based Malayalam script to write his Ramayana, although the Vatteluttu writing system was the traditional writing system of Kerala then. Recitation of Adhyathmaramayanam Kilippattu is very important in Hindu families in Kerala. The month of Karkitakam in the Malayalam calendar is celebrated as the Ramayana recitation month and Ramayana is recited in Hindu houses and temples across Kerala. Date and authorship Tradition ascribes the authorship of the Sanskrit Adhyathma Ramayana to Ramananda since it is said to be an integral part of Brahmanda Purana. However, some scholars attribute it to the period 14th - 15th century CE and the author as unknown. Adhyathma Ramayana is the portrayal of a conversation between Lord Siva and Goddess Parvati, as reported by Lord Brahma to Sage Narada. It is this work that provided Tulasidas with the inspiration to compose his immortal work, the Ramacharitamanasa. This is the same work which was translated by Thunchathu Ezhuthachan into Malayalam in the form of kilippattu, a South Indian genre in which a parrot recites the text to the poet. Other versions Traditionally, two ancient sources of Ramayana are Valmiki Ramayana and Ramavataram. Ramavataram, popularly referred to as Kamba Ramayanam, is a Tamil epic that was written by the Tamil poet Kamban during the 12th century. Other versions of Ramayana are Vasishta Ramayana, Ananda Ramayana, Agasthya Ramayana in Sanskrit, Ranganatha Ramayana in Telugu, Tulasi Ramayana or Ramacharitamanasa in Hindi, Kirtivasa Ramayana in Bengali. Deviation from Valmiki Ramayana # The major alteration in the fact of the story found in the Adhyatma Ramayana is the introduction of a \\"Maya Sita\\" or Shadow Sita throughout the period of her abduction. The (real) Sita disappears into fire just before the golden deer episode. Tulasidasa also follows the Adhyatma Ramayana in this respect. In the Adhyatma Ramayana, Sita emerges from the fire at the end of the war when the shadow Sita enters into it. (The whole drama is preplanned and enacted at the bidding of Sri Rama Himself). # Other alterations in the Adhyatma Ramayana include: Ravana treats Sita with the respect due to a mother and Sri Rama establishes a Shiva Lingam at the site of the bridge to Lanka. # The major contribution of the Adhyatma Ramayana lies in the casting of Rama in the role of the spiritual teacher and in the several exquisite hymns sung in praise of Rama. There are four occasions when Rama assumes the role of the teacher and gives philosophical disquisition. # Rama reveals himself as four-handed Mahavishnu at his very birth, a feature that is not seen in Valmiki # Sage Valmiki depicts Sri. Rama as an ideal man while admitting his divinity, whereas Sage Vyasa present him as the Supreme Being incarnate with the full remembrance of his divinity and the recognition of it by all wise men. # In response to Lakshmana‚Äôs questions on different occasions he teaches knowledge, devotion and detachment, methods of worship and the way of emancipation. In reply to Kaushalya‚Äôs query, Rama teaches the three Yogas of Karma (action), Jnana (knowledge) and Bhakti (devotion). # The well known Ramagita is part of Adhyatma Ramayana. It contains teachings on Advaita Vedanta. The real contribution of this work is in its repeatedly propounding the doctrine that Rama is Brahman the absolute and that Sita is His Maya- shakti or Prakriti, thereby raising the personality of Rama to the highest level and providing a firm base to the worship of Rama. # Ahalya the wife of Sage Gautama Maharishi is in invisible form in the Valmiki Ramayana, whereas in the Adhyatma she has been depicted in the rock form. # In the Ayodhya Kanda of Adhyatma Ramayana the section opens with a visit of Sage Narada to Rama to remind him of the purpose of his incarnation, which Sri. Rama acknowledges. All these incidents are not in Valmiki. # In the Adhyatma, banishment of Sri Rama is accomplished by the Devas through Goddess Saraswathi, by possessing the two women i.e. maid servant Manthara and Kaikeyi. In Valmiki this incident is explained as a simple court intrigue. # Sage Valmiki's evil past has been explained in detail in Adhyatma, but not in the other. # In Adhyatma, Lakshmana requests Rama to instruct him on the means of attaining moksha. Rama also gives him an elaborate discourse on Jnana and Bhakti, conveying the quintessence of Vedanta. This is not in Valmiki's. # According to Adhyatma, Ravana is aware that Sri Rama in human form is Lord Vishnu incarnated to kill him.

According to the advice of Rama she goes to Badari to attain Mukthi. This episode is absent in Valmiki. # Sampati gives an elaborate discourse to the monkeys who meet him He quotes Sage Chandramas, while telling about the divinity of Sri. Rama. This incident is available in Adhyatma only. # A conspicuous addition in the Adhyatma is Rama's installation of the Sivalinga in Rameswara, before the construction of Sethu for the success of the enterprise. Rama also declares about the merit of Pilgrimage to Rameswara and Sethu Bandha here. These elaborations are not available in Valmiki. # Sri Rama is well aware of his divinity during the Nagapasa arrow episode and Garuda‚Äôs arrival to release them. In Valmiki, Rama is not aware of his Divinity till the end when Brahma imparts that knowledge to him. # Kalanemi obstructs Hanuman while he is on his way to bring Mritasanjivani, a herb that can revive one who is almost dead. This incident is absent in Valmiki. # Narada praises Rama after the death of Kumbhakarna in Adhyatma.

Vibhishana informs Rama that Ravana has got amrita deposited in his umbilicus and that until it is removed he cannot be killed. This is available in Adhyatma Ramayana. But in Valmiki Ramayana as per the advice of Sage Agasthya Rama chants Adhithya Hridaya and worships Lord Surya to kill Ravana. # According to Adhyatma on the death of Ravana, his spirit, having luminosity of lighting enters into Rama and attains moksha. This explanation finds no place in Valmiki. # After the death of Ravana, Sita's fire ordeal is only to replace the Maya Sita by Rama. The whole event is given the appearance of a real ordeal in Valmiki. # In Adhyatma Ramayana everyone praises and chants the hymn on Rama starting from Vamadeva, Valmiki, Bharadwaja, Narada, Viradha, Sarabanga River, Sutikshna, Agasthya, Viswamitra, Vasishta, Jatayu, Kabhanda, Sabari, Swayamprabha, Parasurama, Vibhishana, and Hanuman.

It is the largest individual member church of the Lutheran World Federation. With the encouragement of the Lutheran and Presbyterian missionary societies in Ethiopia and the Lutheran World Federation, the Evangelical congregations in several parts of the country met on April 23 and 25, 1958 to deliberate on the draft constitution and establish the EECMY. From these joint efforts the church was instituted as a national church on January 21, 1959, taking its name from the first congregation in Addis Ababa, Mekane Yesus (\\"Place of Jesus\\").\\"Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus (EECMY)\\" , World Council of Churches website (accessed 2 June 2009) EECMY has a motto of \\"Serving the Whole Person\\" that was developed in the 1970s. This \\"holistic ministry\\" theme has helped it to carry out its ministry in evangelism and development work. One of the leading theologians of the EECMY was Gudina Tumsa (1929‚Äì1979), who was general secretary for several years up until his arrest and murder at the hands of the communist government of Ethiopia in 1979. The church, which was born out of Swedish missionary work amongst others, today through Mekane Yesus International Missionary Society itself has many missionaries in countries all around the world: South Asia, several African countries, the Middle East, and Guyana.  History  The EECMY was founded on work begun by Northern European missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These missionaries concentrated their work in southern Ethiopia, where the Orthodox Christian influence was less profound. The strategy of the missionaries and evangelists to implant a Protestant church in Ethiopia was one of development. At a time when Emperor Haile Selassie was looking to modernize and promote progress in the state, foreign and domestic missions were some of the most productive agents. In fact, Selassie wrote in his autobiography that he only ‚Äúpermitted missions because of their efforts in the field of education and health care‚Äù.[Eide, Oeyvind. Revolution and Religion in Ethiopia: Growth and Persecution of the Mekane Yesus Church, 1974-85. 2nd ed. Oxford: James Currey, 2000. Print.] It was through development that the Evangelical church was able to first establish a presence in the 19th and 20th centuries. In fact, as more people in power in the Orthodox Church began to question the validity of foreign missions in Ethiopian society, and as the identification of the Orthodox Church and the Amharic language as unifying forces within Ethiopia began to grow, many of the people who held high administrative positions owed their education to the mission schools, and were thus reluctant to pass any legislation against them. Thus, while many sociological and religious forces weighed against the Evangelical church and its missions in Ethiopia, the fact that it was effective as an agent of development aided its survival through its burgeoning years. The Orthodox Church was still favored in the eyes of most as the true Ethiopian religion, as shown in the Imperial Decree on Missions in 1944, which stated that the missions could not engage in religious activities in ‚ÄúEthiopian Church areas‚Äù; however, the decree allowed considerable freedom for missionaries, most of whom were still foreign. The EECMY church was beginning to gain some legitimacy in the eyes of at least a few, but was still seen as a spawn of foreign, colonial activity. This was made evident when the Mekane Yesus church became ‚Äúlegally registered‚Äù on February 13, 1969, even though it had been functioning as an independent entity since 1959. In assigning an official name to the Lutheran offshoot, semantics became a key point of contention. The patriarch of the EOC at the time was largely opposed to the word ‚ÄúEthiopian‚Äù being attached to the church‚Äôs name, as he claimed it was nothing but an organization, ‚Äúinspired and led from abroad‚Äù. He was also against it being officially registered as a church, claiming that it was merely an organization. After much debate however, the name was established as the ‚ÄúEvangelical Church Mekane Yesus in Ethiopia‚Äù (ECMY). It was changed to its current title ‚ÄúEthiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus (EECMY) in 1978.[.] The Patriarch‚Äôs perspective represents the general sentiment among orthodox followers that the Mekane Yesus church was not truly a native church. While the Orthodox Church had a long history in Ethiopia and had shaped much of the culture of the center, there were still large pockets of cultures unaffected by the church, especially in the peripheral regions where the EECMY experienced most of its growth, such as the south and the west. One of the prominent early Ethiopian evangelists, Onesimos Nesib, was crucial in this spread. He was active in his work in the spreading of the gospel to the marginal regions of the country that were both hard to reach and restricted by the government, and he also was the first person to translate the entire Protestant Bible into the language of the Oromo, the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia. This in itself was a huge step for the EECMY. Because of Nesib's work, the ECMY was able to gain a large constituency outside the Orthodox centers, specifically among the Oromo. The Orthodox Church has always represented the greatest institutional obstacle for the growth of the EECMY, if not actively, then by its mere presence and dominance in the public sphere. The EECMY has seen opposition from Muslims as well. The particularly malicious bent taken towards Evangelical churches during the Derg's socialist revolution of the 1970s, which manifested itself in attacks on EECMY churches by means of arson, arrests, and forced closings, exemplified this place in society. Additionally, the labels of outsider, colonist, enemy, and stranger were all stigmas with which the EECMY lived in the decades leading up to the fighting. The persecution of the church was evident before the socialist revolution, and only increased during the war. As a response to this, the church ‚Äì now left largely to itself as many foreign missionaries were evacuated for safety‚Äôs sake ‚Äì began to develop a rugged theology responding to its suffering, with phrases such as ‚ÄúGod is with us‚Äù and ‚ÄúHitherto the Lord has helped us‚Äù emphasized in the church‚Äôs conferences of the time. One of the EECMY pastors who emerged as a political and religious leader in this trying time was Gudina Tumsa, who has been called ‚Äúthe Dietrich Bonhoeffer of Africa‚Äù in the years following his martyrdom in 1979. In 2000, Rev. Bekure Daba was received as the Church's first ordained woman. The Reformed section of the denomination was founded by the United Presbyterian Church in 1869. Dr. Thomas Lambie, a missionary of the United Presbyterian Church, begun work in the western part of the country. During the Italian occupation, missionaries were forced to leave, but the Bethel Evangelical Church was founded with native believers. It became an independent church in 1947. After World War II, BEC experienced rapid growth. In 1974 it became part of the EECMY, and now it has more than 1,000 000 members. Former BEC presbyteries and synods retain their names. In the western Synod of Gambela, more than 60% of the population are members of the Bethel Evangelical Church.  Theology  = Gudina Tumsa, Emmanuel Abraham, and Holistic Theology = Gudina Tumsa is in many regards the father of the indigenous theological thought of the EECMY, and especially its Holistic Theology. In fact, a study of his theology and the theology of Emmanuel Abraham (a colleague, contemporary, and friend) comprises a large portion of the EECMY theology. Tumsa studied theology in the United States, and because of this gained a relatively broad understanding of mission and the church. Upon returning to Ethiopia, he \\"gave his church a decisive push towards independence in theological thought and church practice\\", criticizing many aspects of Western Christianity. Much of his theology is contained in the letters he wrote to church leaders and the general public, as well as in the addresses he gave at various conferences around the world in the 1960s and 1970s. The main points of his theology center on a holistic hermeneutic that not only encompasses a broad ontology, but which also applies itself to both the life in this world and in the next. His theology can be portrayed as a type of liberation theology, but cannot be categorized strictly in this class; indeed, it contains a uniquely Ethiopian flavor, ‚Äúa theology of liberation in the Ethiopian context‚Äù, as Tasgara Hirpo describes it. Tumsa describes his own theology as a ‚Äúholistic theology‚Äù, writing in a memo to Abraham that ‚Äúwestern theology has lost the this-worldly dimension of human existence‚Äù; according to him, his holistic theology is merely ‚Äúan effort in rediscovering total human life‚Äù in all its width and breadth. It does not allow the suffering of this world to eclipse the joy of the next ‚Äì the physical reality to overtake the spiritual ‚Äì but instead he says that both are in need of redemption, salvation, and liberation. In this regard, Abraham and Tumsa differ in their approach to state involvement. For several years, Abraham held a position in the government that allowed him significant sway within political circles, all the while remaining faithful to the EECMY, of which he was president for 22 years.[.] He tended toward unity with the central powers rather than ‚Äòrocking the boat,‚Äô even though he saw his people suffering oppression. Tumsa was more willing to part with the central powers in favor of the oppressed people of his church, as evidenced by his omission of Emperor Haile Selassie‚Äôs name from the normal intercessions in the Sunday liturgy in the months leading up to the socialist revolution in response to the feudal system that Tumsa saw as an instrument of oppression. Yet, however divergent their perspectives on church- state relations may appear, there was unity in that they both supported the creation of quasi-public institutions of education, health, and vocational training that the government not only supported, but also maintained when the network of institutions outgrew the administrative capability of the EECMY. They were both dedicated to a church that worked in conjunction with the state for the development of better lives for their countrymen; where they differed was the measure of allegiance they meted out to the government or to the people. Either way, the EECMY took seriously their commission to carry their message into the world. = Ecumenism and Western theological criticism = Tumsa emerged as the leader of the movement to develop a characteristically Ethiopian theology and to share it for the edification not only of the nation, but also of other Christians abroad. He described the goal of the EECMY in relation to its global sister churches as ‚Äúself-reliance‚Äù and ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù. ‚ÄúIndependence is a legitimate political aim; it can never be an acceptable theological aim for the church,‚Äù Tumsa said in a debate. His life showcased this in that, even as he urged the church to gain an independent theology based on the Ethiopian experience, he was also constantly in conversation with brothers and sisters in other nations, engaging in several multinational theological conferences. In reference to Western theology, Gudina was both familiar and critical, having been trained at Luther Seminary in Minnesota, which gave him a solid foundation for theologizing in Ethiopia. In contrast to the Holistic Theology that characterized both his perspective and that of the EECMY, Tumsa perceived that there was too great a disconnect between Western theology and ethics, and was said to have promoted a praxis-reflection-praxis ethical model. He thought this provided an interesting alternative to the prevalent church-state separation that he believed characterized the American church. Tumsa wanted Western Christians to reexamine their actions in light of a Holistic theological framework. He urged them to reevaluate their ethical consciousness in light of national and global societal problems. Finally, Tumsa's perspective on ecumenism theology is brought to light in Tumsa's and Abraham‚Äôs 1972 report ‚ÄúOn the Interrelation between Proclamation of the Gospel and Human Development.‚Äù Among other arguments, they discussed the ‚Äúsimply frightening‚Äù reality arising as a result of the rapid growth and ‚Äúphenomenal expansion‚Äù of the Christian Church across Africa in the last few decades. They asserted that not only will this result in an immense shortage of ‚Äúphysical plant‚Äù (e.g. church buildings, religious education, literacy programs, etc.) in countries such as Ethiopia who are struggling with so much growth, but it also establishes the ‚Äú‚Äòcenter of gravity‚Äô in the Christian world‚Äù firmly on the African continent. This puts immense theological responsibility on the ‚Äúhistorically young churches‚Äù of the world, which are not only dealing with a lack of theological experience and history, but will also have to manage a shortage of resources available to solve these mounting difficulties.  Membership  EECMY claimed almost 2.3 million members in 2007, growing to 8.3 million baptized members according to the 2016 statistics. They operate a seminary in Addis Ababa with 150 students. The church also owns several bible colleges, schools, and health care and a social facilities in various locations throughout the country. In Addis Ababa they also run a language and cultural orientation school, called MY-LINC, for people who want to learn Ethiopian languages. Most congregations speak local languages, but the International Lutheran Church (Ethiopia) is English speaking.  Relations with other churches  The EECMY approved the establishment of a full communion relationship with the North American Lutheran Church at their convocation in August 2011. The EECMY decided to end its partnership with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Church of Sweden, because of their acceptance of same-sex unions and non-celibate homosexual clergy, after a resolution that was approved at the 19th General Assembly in Addis Ababa, on February 11, 2013. The EECMY has also established relationships with the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod and the Reformed Church in America, both from the United States. The EECMY is a member of the Global Confessional and Missional Lutheran Forum, the Lutheran World Federation, the World Council of Churches, the All Africa Conference of Churches, the Lutheran Communion in Central and Eastern Africa, and the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The EECMY, because of its development work, is a member of ACT Development, a global alliance of churches and related agencies committed to working together on development. EECMY is a participant in the Wycliffe Global Alliance and it is a member of the Fellowship of Christian Councils and Churches in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa.

It is located north-east of Colombo. The current chief incumbent (chief priest) is Venerable Professor Kollupitiye Mahinda Sangharakkhitha Thera. The temple has often been associated with the rise and fall of Ceylon / Sri Lanka, with the popular saying that as the Kelaniya temple rose, Sri Lanka rose and as it fell, the country and its administration fell. It has thus had a deep association with the political powers of the country. It is also infamous for Mapitigama Buddharakkitha, the chief conspirator of the 1959 assassination of Ceylon's fourth Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. Buddharakkitha was the chief incumbent (chief priest) of the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara from 1947 to 1959. History Buddhists believe the temple to have been hallowed during the third and final visit of the Lord Buddha to Sri Lanka, eight years after gaining enlightenment.Wilhelm Geiger (Tr), The Mahavansa, or The Great Chronicle of Ceylon, Oxford, OUP, 1920. Its history would thus go back to before 500 BCE. The Mahawansa records that the original Stupa at Kelaniya enshrined a gem-studded throne on which the Buddha sat and preached. The temple flourished during the Kotte era but much of its land was confiscated during the Portuguese empire. Under the Dutch empire, however, there were new gifts of land and under the patronage of King Kirthi Sri Rajasingha the temple was rebuilt. It was refurbished in the first half of the 20th century with the help of Helena Wijewardana. The temple is also famous for its image of the reclining Gautama Buddha and paintings by the native artist Solias Mendis which depict important events in the life of the Buddha, in the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, also incidents from the Jataka tales. It is the venue for the Duruthu Maha Perehera procession each January. An 18-foot stone statue of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara has been erected at the temple.

It was one of the four major Buddhist monasteries established in Sri Lanka, after the arrival of Arhant Mahinda Thera to the country. The site of the Tissamaharama Raja Maha Vihara was consecrated by Lord Buddha himself, who spent some time in meditation there with 500 arhats (individuals who have reached enlightenment), during his third visit to the island.Daily Mirror - Letters Daily Mirror Tissamaharama monastery had been recognized as a pre-eminent Buddhist educational center of the southern Sri Lanka from the 3rd century B.C. to the 11th century A.D. The Tissamaharama Dagoba which is situated in the premises of the monastery is one of the largest stupas in Sri Lanka. The present chief incumbent of Tissamaharama Raja Maha Vihara is Ven. Devalegama Dhammasena Nayaka Thera.Photographic Exhibition - India Through Sri Lankan Eyes , Consulate General of India in Hambantota, August 2016 History During the reign of emperor Asoka of India (304‚Äì232 BCE), many prominent Buddhist monks were sent as missionaries to neighboring kingdoms to propagate Buddhist philosophy. As a part of these missions, Arhant Mahinda Thera, the son of emperor Asoka arrived in Sri Lanka during the reign of king Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura in 3rd century BC. After the establishment of Buddha Sasana in Sri Lanka, major Buddhist monasteries such as Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya and Mihintale Raja Maha Viharaya were established in the North central region of the country while Tissamaharama Raja Maha Viharaya and Sithulpawwa Rajamaha Viharaya were established in the Southern region. According to the chronicle Mahawamsa this temple was built in the 2nd century BC as Silapassa Pirivena, by then King Kavan Tissa (186-161 B.C.) of Ruhuna (Southern Sri Lanka) and in the reign of King Ilanaga (38-44 A.D.) the temple had been expanded and renovated. But according to some historians the temple was initially built by king Mahanaga in the 3rd century BC and later it was expanded as a major temple by king Kavan Tissa in the 2nd century BC. The beginning of kingdom of Ruhuna dates back to the reign of king Devanampiyatissa in 2nd century BC. His younger brother Mahanaga left the then capital Anuradhapura to avoid an assassination attempt and moved to the southern area of the island and became the ruler of the area.King Mahanaga, first king of Ruhuna, Funday Times Mahanaga is regarded as the first king of Ruhuna,The Kingdom of Ruhuna, Lanka Information where the capital of was Magama. King Mahanaga did a great service to improve agriculture and was responsible for raising a peaceful and prosperous civilization in the Southern Province of Sri Lanka. He was succeeded by his son Yatala-Tissa, who was able to rule the province virtuously. After Yatala- Tissa his son Gothabhaya became the king of the south, and by this time the kingdom of Ruhuna was well established and developed. After Gothabhaya, his son Kavan-Tissa succeeded to the throne. King Kawan Tissa is regarded as the founder of many Buddhist monasteries located in Southern and Eastern areas of Sri Lanka. Thissmaharama Vihara was the largest Buddhist monastery in historic Southern Sri Lanka. Some of the notable resident Buddhist monks of this great monastery includes Arhant Mahasiva Thera, Arhant Dhammadinna Thera and Arhant Pindapathika Tissa Thera. King Kawan Tissa who founded Tissmaharama Vihara also modified the Tissa wewa (tank) to cater the water requirement of Tissamaharama monastery, as well as for the irrigation purposes of surrounding area. Many ancient kings of Sri Lanka had also offered lands to the Tissamaharama monastery for the welfare of Buddhist monks who lived there. According to ancient stone inscriptions found, many land donations to the Tissamaharama Vihara were made during the reigns of king Jettha Tissa, Wasabha and Mihindu. From 3rd century to the 5th century the monastery owned more than 18 000 acres of land. These land donations were made by the kings for the maintenance work of the monastery and the stupa as well as for the needs of the resident monks. First evidences of renovating Tissamaharama Vihara goes to the reign of king Illanaga in 38 AD, after two centuries of its initial construction. King Voharaka Tissa (215 -237 AD) in the 3rd century had also made some renovations to the stupa. Prince Mahanaga renovated the stupa in 560 AD, when the status of the stupa deteriorated once again in the 6th century. It had also undergone renovations during the reign of king Vijayabahu I (1055-1110 AD). But later Thissamaharama Vihara was raided by the armies of invader Kalinga Magha in the 13th century. It appears that no major restoration work was done on this stupa till the last half of the 19th century after this rifling. However sources reveal that in 1662 AD, king Veera Parakrama Narendrasinghe donated two lands to the temple for the maintenance purposes, when Kadurupokune Budhdha Rakkhitha Thero was the chief incumbent. But later in the 18th century Tissmaharama Vihara was abandoned after the state of the temple deteriorated badly, during the Dutch Colonial rule in the coastal areas of Sri Lanka. Great stupa Tissamaharama stupa Tissamaharama Stupa is the largest stupa in the Southern region of the country with a height of 156 feet and 550 feet in circumference. According to chronicles, King Kawan Tissa had sought blessings and instructions from Arhant Gothama Thera, who was a spiritual adviser to the king, when constructing Tissamaharam stupa.Tissamaharama Rajamaha Viharaya ‚Äì ‡∂≠‡∑í‡∑É‡∑ä‡∑É‡∂∏‡∑Ñ‡∑è‡∂ª‡∑è‡∂∏ ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∑Ñ‡∑è‡∂ª‡∂∫, Amazing Lanka The stupa was built to commemorate lord Buddha's visit to the area, at the same place where Buddha spent time in meditation with 500 arhant Buddhist monks. The stupa which has a 'Bubble Shape' and was built by using bricks on a square platform made of granite stones. King Kawan-tissa received the instructions of Buddhist monks throughout the construction period of the stupa. The relics enshrined in this stupa is subjected to debate. According to Mahavamsa the frontal bone relic (Lalata Dhathu) is enshrined in Tissamaharam stupa as the main relic.Heritage of ancient Magama, the capital of Ruhuna kingdom, Lakdasun Trips However some believe that the frontal bone relic of Buddha was temporally enshrined in this stupa but later it was enshrined in the Seruvila Mangala Maha Chethiya. A recent discovery of a pillar inscription in Kirinda, reveals that the left tooth relic of Buddha was also enshrined in this stupa. Restoration The more recent restoration work of this stupa had begun in 1858 due to the efforts of Wepathaira Sumana Thera, who rediscovered Thissmaharama Vihara after making a pilgrimage to the area. He built a hut in the vicinity of the stupa and started living there to supervise the restoration works by himself. It took 16 years to complete the renovation work of the Garbhaya, semi spherical part of the stupa which is 86 feet in height. But Wepathaira Sumana Thera could not complete the restoration of Thissmaharama stupa in his lifetime and after the death of Wepathaira Sumana Thera, Walpita Medhankara Thero, a monastic brother of Wepathaira Sumana Thera took over the renovation works. By 1878 Walpita Medhankara Thero managed to complete the restoration of Hatharaskotwa of the stupa and enshrined relics in it. In 1882 the British governor general of Ceylon, Sir James Robert Longden visited Thissamaharama Vihara and appointed Walpita Medhankara Thero as the chief incumbent of the temple. He also vested the power to Siyam Nikaya to take care of Tissamaharama Raja Maha Vihara. In 1895 Walpita Medhankara Thero managed to complete the work of Dewatha Kotuwa and enshrined relics there. In 1897 the Tissamaharama Raja Maha Vihara development committee was formed with the leadership of Mudaliyar S. F. Jayawickrama of Matara and N. Amarasingha of Tangalle and the restoration works completed in early 20th century.Poson Day Historic Reflections and Buddhist Activity in the Colonial Time Upali K Salgado (The Island) Retrieved 18 November 2015 In 1900 the Koth Kerella of the stupa was completed and placing the pinnacle (Chuda Manikya) of the stupa was done on Poson poya day of 1900. The pinnacle consists of a red colour gem which was imported from Bohemia. Tissamaharama stupa had developed a series of vertical cracks right round the dome of the stupa and in some other parts around in 1990. The department of Archeology of Sri Lanka and State Engineering Co-operation intervened on the request of chief incumbent of the temple and prevented further cracking of the stupa by using galvanized steel cables tied around the circumference of the dome in the mid section. This final repair works were completed in February 1998 at a total cost of 6 million Sri Lankan rupees.

Elias Burton Holmes (1870‚Äì1958) was an American traveler, photographer and filmmaker, who coined the term \\"travelogue\\". Travel stories, slide shows, and motion pictures were all in existence before Holmes began his career, as was the profession of travel lecturer; but Holmes was the first person to put all of these elements together into documentary travel lectures. Early years Elias Burton Holmes was born into a middle-class Chicago family, the son of a banker. His interest in travel was sparked at the age of nine when his grandmother took him to hear a then-famous travel lecturer, John L. Stoddard (whom Holmes was to meet on a subsequent trip abroad). In 1890, Holmes accompanied his grandmother on a trip to Europe and when he returned showed slides of his trip at the Chicago Camera Club, of which he was a member. Holmes wrote of this event: \\"To take the edge off the silence, to keep the show moving, I wrote an account of my journey and read it, as the stereopticon man changed slides.\\"Wallace, Irving. \\"Everybody's Rover Boy\\". In The Sunday Gentleman, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1965, p. 115. Despite the success of this event, which grossed $350 for the club, it wasn't until several years later that Holmes decided to set himself up as a travel lecturer. In 1893, after sending out 2000 invitations to a select group of Chicagoans, Holmes gave two sold-out talks about a recent trip to Japan. Travelogues Initially Holmes had only modest success as a travel lecturer. Then in 1897, John L. Stoddard retired, creating something of a vacuum in the field. Around the same time, Holmes began to supplement his hand-colored glass slides with the then excitingly new technology of moving pictures. As the years went on, film came increasingly to dominate his lectures.\\"Burton Holmes, Extraordinary Traveler\\" website, \\"Hand-Painted Colored Slides\\" page. In the years that followed, Holmes traveled extensively: North and South America, Europe, Russia, India, Ethiopia, Burma (now Myanmar). He lectured about such topics as the Panama Canal, the \\"Frivolities of Paris,\\" even the adventures of Richard Halliburton, one of his competitors in the travel lecture profession. He visited the first modern Olympics in 1896, rode the first trans-Siberian train, and shot what may be the first movies ever made of Japan, in 1899. In the course of his travels, he crossed the Atlantic and Pacific oceans more than 50 times. As Holmes became more well-known he brought along assistants to shoot film and stills while he made notes for his lectures, and he also employed a business manager. With the rise of Hollywood, Holmes began to make short travel films for Paramount and later Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Holmes's talks‚Äîwhich totaled over 8000 by the end of his life‚Äîdrew their largest audiences in cosmopolitan cities like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. He catered especially to the armchair traveler with escapist fantasies, and for this reason he consciously focused his lectures on the most agreeable and scenic aspects of the places he lectured about. He avoided all discussion of politics, poverty, and other social ills.Wallace, Irving. \\"Everybody's Rover Boy\\". In The Sunday Gentleman, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1965, p. 113. Personal life In 1914, Holmes married Margaret Oliver, whom he had met on one of his expeditions. They lived primarily at an estate called \\"Topside\\" in the Hollywood Hills that was a former riding club. Holmes also had a duplex, \\"Nirvana\\", in New York that was packed with treasures from Southeast Asia; this he eventually sold to Robert Ripley.\\"Burton Holmes, Extraordinary Traveler\\", burtonholmes.org; accessed March 2, 2018.

The term \\"time bomb\\" does not refer to a program that stops functioning a specific number of days after it is installed; instead, the term \\"trialware\\" applies. Time bombs are commonly used in beta (pre- release) software when the manufacturer of the software does not want the beta version being used after the final release date. One example of time bomb software would be Microsoft's Windows Vista Beta 2, which was programmed to expire on May 31, 2007.Windows Vista home page The time limits on time bomb software are not usually as heavily enforced as they are on trial software, since time bomb software does not usually implement secure clock functions. Comparison of logic bombs and time bombs The main differences between logic bombs and time bombs is that a logic bomb may have a timing function implemented into it as a failsafe if the conditions are not met in a certain time period (it may delete itself or activate its payload using the timing system), while time bombs only use timing functions to (de)activate themselves. Time bombs, once activated, will unload their payload (which may be malicious) in a similar way logic bombs deliver their payloads to the target. The main difference between both time and logic bombs and fork bombs, is that a fork bomb has no payload per se, and instead does its damage by continually replicating itself to deplete available system resources.  History  The first use of a time bomb in software may have been with the Scribe markup language and word processing system, developed by Brian Reid. Reid sold Scribe to a software company called Unilogic (later renamed Scribe SystemsPostScript Printer Driver Optimization Case Study, Adobe Systems, Technical Note #5042, 31 March 1992. Page 5.), and agreed to insert a set of time-dependent functions (called \\"time bombs\\") that would deactivate freely copied versions of the program after a 90-day expiration date. To avoid deactivation, users paid the software company, which then issued a code that defused the internal time bomb feature. Richard Stallman saw this as a betrayal of the programmer ethos. Instead of honoring the notion of share-and- share alike, Reid had inserted a way for companies to compel programmers to pay for information access (see Events leading to GNU).

All such attempts failed, possibly due to the lack of a single location of celebrations, or commercial organisations failing to condemn some of the celebrations' more \\"questionable\\" activities. Most recently, in 2012 some 12,000 people met the sunrise at Kamen Bryag where the song \\"July Morning\\" was performed by ex-Uriah Heep's singer John Lawton.  Meaning and significance  The name of the tradition comes from the British rock band Uriah Heep's 1971 hit \\"July Morning\\" which became widely popular in Bulgaria in the 1980s and somehow named and remained central to this unique Bulgarian tradition. There are many versions of the meaning of the tradition. Most people consider July Morning a celebration of a new beginning and freedom in the spirit of the hippie movement. For others, it is a good reason for a late night/early morning party as July 1 is the first day of summer break for most high schools in Bulgaria and the unofficial start of the summer vacationing season, traditionally culminating with a trip to the Black Sea coast in July or August. July Morning may be related to sun worship (see also Peter Deunov) and to midsummer night rites popular throughout Bulgarian lands from time immemorial.  History  The various accounts on the beginnings of July Morning vary widely, mostly depending on the meaning that the teller puts into the tradition. It is said that the July Morning arose sometime in the 1980s among young people as a subtle protest against the Communist regime. Even though, there are no records of organised protests there were informal and sporadic marches called 'happening' (–•–µ–ø—ä–Ω–∏–Ω–≥). After studying subcultures in Serbia, Macedonia and Bulgaria, Nikola Bo≈æiloviƒá argues that the subcultural self of adolescents comprises a certain degree of symbolic aggression which serves to challenge authorities, to oppose regulations and to refute social conventions. That is why it is well-grounded to consider rock subcultural identities of the young as identities for resistance. Many young people felt attracted to some of the so-called hippie ideals from the 1960s, communicated mainly through rock and pop music of the time. As a country behind the Iron Curtain, Bulgaria did not have a music market similar to the ones in the Western countries and it was not uncommon for albums and tracks by Western artists to become popular years, sometimes decades, after their initial release. This seems to be the case with Uriah Heep's song \\"July Morning\\".

Earthquake Relief, Managua, Nicaragua Soldiers of the 13th ESC first deployed as the 13th Support Brigade in response to the Managua earthquake, where its soldiers served at Camp Christine, Managua, Nicaragua, assisting in disaster relief from 23 December 1972 to 19 January 1973. Units of the 13th deployed in Nicaragua included: *21st Evacuation Hospital *255th Medical Detachment *528th Transportation Company (-) Desert Storm Though the headquarters did not deploy to Desert Shield and Desert Storm, units from the 13th COSCOM began to deploy in the fall of 1990 to Saudi Arabia to provide combat support and combat service support during the Gulf War. During Operation Desert Calm and Operation Provide Comfort, soldiers of the 13th ESC deployed to the Persian Gulf area. In 1992, 13th COSCOM soldiers deployed to Cuba to aid Haitian refugees during Operation Safe Harbor, and later assisted victims of Hurricane Andrew in Florida. 13th ESC soldiers led the way as III Corps units deployed to Kuwait to train and ensure the peace in support of Operation Intrinsic Action. Operation Restore Hope In 1992, the U.S. Central Command established Unified Task Force Somalia (UNITAF) in light of the worsening situation in Somalia and 13th COSCOM was called to duty. 13th COSCOM Commander Brig. Gen. Billy K. Solomon deployed along with a portion of the 13th COSCOM headquarters to Mogadishu to serve as the nucleus of Joint Task Force Support Command, the first time where a COSCOM was given the mission to provide theater-level support. Soldiers of the Lucky 13th returned in May 1993. Their major units included: :593rd Corps Support Group (Fort Lewis) :36th Engineer Group (Fort Benning) :7th Transportation Group (Fort Eustis) :62nd Medical Group (Fort Lewis) Humanitarian aid and peacekeeping From October through December 1994, 13th COSCOM soldiers provided multifunctional logistical support to Army forces supporting Operation Vigilant Warrior in Kuwait. Units of the 13th COSCOM conducted humanitarian and/or peacekeeping missions in Cuba as part of Operation Sea Signal V, Haiti Operation Uphold Democracy, Honduras JTF-B, Operation Strong Support, and were a part of Stabilization Force (SFOR) 6 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The 13th COSCOM also deployed their engineers to Thule, Greenland, for additional support missions. Soldiers from the command have assisted in removing snow in Massachusetts, aiding flood victims in Louisiana, processing refugees in Arkansas, fighting forest fires in Montana, assisting earthquake victims in Mexico or helping flood victims in Curio, Texas. Following the attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, elements of the 13th COSCOM supported Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Operation Iraqi Freedom Operation Iraqi Freedom again saw 13th COSCOM units deployed, including 64th Corps Support Group, directly supporting the 4th Infantry Division. Elements of the 49th Movement Control Battalion have been continuously deployed in the region since 1997 and remain a critical node supporting all U.S. and coalition forces. 13th COSCOM first deployed a medical evacuation headquarters and an air evacuation company on 12 February 2003, to Kuwait. Those units were to reposition forces as required to support the president's global war on terrorism. Eventually, the 13th COSCOM deployed both of its local Brigades in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom while the headquarters and separate units supported the families at Fort Hood, Texas. In August 2003 deployment notification came for the soldiers of the 13th COSCOM headquarters to participate in the ongoing operations in Iraq. In preparation for its first major deployment since Somalia, the 13th COSCOM colors were cased in a deployment and retreat ceremony held on the afternoon of 18 December 2004, at Sadowski Field on Fort Hood. = OIF II = CAMPAIGN: TRANSITION OF IRAQ - 2 May 2003 TO 28 June 2004 CAMPAIGN: IRAQI GOVERNANCE - 29 June 2004 TO 15 December 2005 On 31 January 2004, the 13th COSCOM completed a transfer of authority with the 3rd Corps Support Command (COSCOM) at Logistics Support Area (LSA) Anaconda in Balad, Iraq, and assumed responsibility to provide logistics support to Combined Joint Task Force 7 in Iraq, later redesignated as the Multi-National Corps Iraq (MNC-I). Major units serving with the 13th COSCOM for OIF II were: * Corps Distribution Command (Provisional) * 172nd Corps Support Group (Broken Arrow, Oklahoma) * 1st Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division(-) (January‚ÄìApril 2004) (Fort Bragg, North Carolina) * 81st BCT(-) (April‚ÄìDecember 2004) (WAARNG) * 593rd Corps Support Group (Fort Lewis, Washington) * 167th Corps Support Group (Londonderry, New Hampshire) * 300th Area Support Group (Fort Lee, Virginia) On 12 December 2004, the 13th COSCOM transferred authority to the 1st Corps Support Command. During its time at LSA Anaconda, the 13th COSCOM processed 2,000 tons of mail; averaged over 200 convoys a day for a total of 62,000 convoys involving 750,000 vehicles; and was responsible for quality of life improvements for the joint forces. The 13th COSCOM uncased its colors, signifying its return home and the end of its mission, at Fort Hood, Texas, on 21 January 2005. =OIF 06-08= CAMPAIGN: NATIONAL RESOLUTION - 16 December 2005 to 9 January 2007 CAMPAIGN: IRAQI SURGE ‚Äì 10 January 2007 to 31 December 2008 The 13th, under its new designation as a sustainment command (expeditionary) deployed once again to Logistics Support Area Anaconda in August, 2006. The command provided logistics oversight for the entire Iraq theater, and assumed command and control of seven subordinate brigades, which included: *1st Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division *593rd Sustainment Brigade *82nd Sustainment Brigade *15th Sustainment Brigade *45th Sustainment Brigade *164th Corps Support Group *657th Area Support Group *81st HBCT *4th Sustainment Brigade *507th Corps Support Group During OIF 06-08, the 13th ESC provided key logistical support to the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, and facilitated the movement and training of the additional 20,000 troops through Camp Buehring, Kuwait. The 13th ESC redeployed to Fort Hood in August, 2007, and quickly started training and preparations for their deployment in support of OIF 09-11. =OIF 09-11= CAMPAIGN: IRAQI SOVEREIGNTY ‚Äì 1 January 2009 to 31 August 2010 The command headquarters again deployed to the former LSA Anaconda, now under Air Force control under the redesignation of Joint Base Balad on 17 July 2009, and assumed the mission for theater logistics on 7 August. The 13th ESC was faced with the largest movement of American forces and military equipment in more than 40 years to facilitate a responsible withdrawal from the Iraq theater of operation. Over the course of a year-long deployment, the 13th ESC brought more than $1 billion worth of equipment back into the U.S. Army supply system. During an average day for the 13th ESC in OIF 09-11, they issued 96,000 cases of bottled water, of fuel, and delivered 137 tons of mail. Some of the major accomplishments of the 13th ESC during OIF 09-11 included: signing a $31 million contract with a local Iraqi company to conduct container repair, opening the first Iraqi bank on Joint Base Balad, partnering with the Iraqi transportation network to get American trucks off the road, and Operation Clean Sweep, a comprehensive effort to reduce excess throughout the entire area of operation. Six soldiers in the command were killed in OIF 09-11: PFC Taylor Marks, SGT Earl Werner, SPC Paul Andersen, SPC Joseph Gallegos, SGT William Spencer and MAJ Ronald Culver. *15th Sustainment Brigade - TX *36th Sustainment Brigade - Texas Army National Guard *256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team - Louisiana Army National Guard *278th Armored Cavalry Regiment - TN *155 Heavy Brigade Combat Team - Mississippi *41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team - Oregon Army Nation Guard *321st Sustainment Brigade - Louisiana *287th Sustainment Brigade - Kansas *304th Sustainment Brigade - California *96th Sustainment Brigade - Utah *90th Sustainment Brigade - Arkansas *3rd Sustainment Brigade - Georgia *10th Sustainment Brigade - New York *16th Sustainment Brigade - Germany *224th Sustainment Brigade - California Hurricane Katrina Deep in the process of deploying and redeploying 13th COSCOM units, key elements of 13th COSCOM supported Joint Task Force Katrina/Rita hurricane relief efforts in the summer of 2005. 13th COSCOM provided 100 million rations, collected human remains with dignity, executed emergency engineering operations, transported, distributed and stored over one billion dollars in humanitarian relief from both non-governmental and federal sources from across the nation. Numbering nearly 1,000 soldiers at the height of operations, the command and staff of the 13th COSCOM formed Logistics Task Force Lonestar, composed of several different units from the support command. Soldiers representing transportation companies, medical and engineer units, maintenance groups and others worked to bring stability back to the storm-ravaged city of New Orleans and, after Hurricane Rita came ashore, close to Lake Charles, La. With a humanitarian support mission for the people of New Orleans, the task force performed logistical missions from purifying water to providing engineer support to help clean up the streets in support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Joint Task Force Katrina. Working in sometimes difficult conditions, the task force was able to accomplish many tasks during their deployment including offering remedies to supply flow issues and establishing a donation distribution warehouse. *HHC, 13th COSCOM *Special Troops Battalion *49th Transportation Battalion *4th Corps Material Management Center Operation Enduring Freedom In December 2011, the 13th ESC command group and portions of the headquarters company deployed to Afghanistan as augmentees to the NATO Training Mission - Afghanistan. Upon arrival, deployed members of the unit integrated into the Deputy Command of Support Operations and served both in the headquarters of the directorate at Camp Eggers in Kabul, as well as in all five regional support commands across the country, conducting logistics training and mentoring of Afghan partners. On 4 February 2012, BG Terence Hildner, Commander 13th ESC died of natural causes in Afghanistan. Kuwait In December 2014, the 13th ESC headquarters deployed to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, to assume the role as the Operational Command Post for the 1st Theater Sustainment Command, with the mission to provide Theater Sustainment Mission Command to Army, Joint, and Multinational Forces in the USCENTCOM Area of Responsibility, enabling Unified Land Operations and Theater Security Cooperation. The 13th ESC supported Operations Inherent Resolve (Iraq), Freedom Sentinel (Afghanistan), Spartan Shield (Kuwait), provided logistics and sustainment support and oversight to the Multinational Forces and Observer mission - Task Force Sinai, supported USCENTCOM forward elements in Jordan, and worked in cooperation with Combined Joint Interagency Task Force - Syria (CJIATF-S) to provide support to moderate Syrian opposition forces in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Current Activities The 13th COSCOM became the first COSCOM to transform to a Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) and deploy to combat during Operation Iraqi Freedom 06-08. The command's primary mission is to provide combat support and combat service support in the areas of supply, maintenance, movement control, field services, and general engineering & construction. At Fort Hood, the 13th ESC currently has the missions of: * Providing command and control of all assigned and attached units. * Providing Combat Service Support to Fort Hood units through: * Direct Support Maintenance to non-divisional units * General Support maintenance and back up direct support maintenance to the 1st Cavalry Division * Support to additional installation activities and functions, as directed. =LSOC-West= Leveraging Sustainment Organizations in CONUS West duties involve coordination with all Sustainment Brigades, Support Brigades, and Army Field Support Brigades in the Continental United States, West of the Mississippi river.

The band-backed wren is a resident breeding species from south-central Gulf Coast Mexico to northwestern Ecuador. It occurs in five disjunct areas, the central region being in southern Central America, in Costa Rica and northern Panama. The next two regions are northern Colombia adjacent to Panama, and 800 km to the south in northwestern Ecuador. Species description This large wren breeds in lowlands and foothills from sea level up to 1700 m altitude in thinned forest or open woodland, scrub, second growth and groves around houses. It mainly occurs on the Caribbean side of the Central American mountain ranges. Its large spherical nest has a wide side entrance and is constructed 2 ‚Äì 30 m high in a tree or shrub, often hidden amidst bromeliads. The female alone incubates the three to five unmarked or lightly brown-spotted white eggs for about two weeks to hatching, and the young fledge in about the same length of time again. After breeding, families sleep together in dormitory nests like those used for breeding throughout the year. The adult band-backed wren is 16.5 cm long and weighs 29 g. It has a brown-grey crown, black nape, and the rest of the upperparts and tail are heavily barred with black, tawny and white. The breast and throat are white, heavily spotted with black, and the belly is cinnamon. Young birds have duller upperparts and off-white to buff underparts. This species has a short rasping zek call. The song is a mix of dry chatters, splutters and gurgles. The band- backed wren forages actively in family groups of 4-12 birds. It eats mainly insects, spiders and other invertebrates.

His diplomatic mission to Japan resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Shimoda in 1855, for which he was made a count. His mission to China in 1858 resulted in the Russian Treaty of Tianjin. Early life Putyatin was descended from a noble family in Novgorod. He entered the Naval Cadet Corps, graduating in 1822, and soon afterwards was appointed to the crew of Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev which circumnavigated the globe in a three-year voyage from 1822 to 1825. He subsequently participated in the Battle of Navarino during the Greek War of Independence on October 20, 1827 and was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir, 4th degree. From 1828 to 1832, the participated in numerous missions in the Mediterranean and in the Baltic, and was awarded the Order of St George, 4th class. In 1832, Admiral Lazarev assigned him to make soundings in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits. During the Caucasian War (1838‚Äì1839), he participated in numerous combat operations and was wounded in combat. After promotion to captain 1st rank, in 1841, he temporarily left military service to travel to England for the purchase of ships for the Black Sea Fleet. Foreign service In 1842, Putyatin was asked by Tsar Nicholas I to lead an armed diplomatic mission to Persia. His main purpose was to strengthen trade via the Caspian Sea, which was plagued by Turkmen piracy. Putyatin established a base at Astrakhan, and subdued the pirates in a military campaign, following which he met with Muhammad Shah of Persia, whom he persuaded to lift trade restrictions, grant fishing rights and to permit steamship communications between Persia and the Volga River. =Expedition to Japan= Putyatin in Nagasaki, 1853. Pallada in Nagasaki, 1854 Japanese painting. The sinking of Diana, Illustrated London News, 1856. Putyatin negotiated the Shimoda Treaty between Japan and Russia Following the successful completion of this mission, Putyatin developed a plan for an expedition to survey Russia's eastern maritime frontiers with China and Japan, with the main objective of finding suitable ports and mapping unknown coastal areas in the region, as well as the possibility of opening Japan to trade relations. The expedition was initially approved by Tsar Nicholas I in 1843, but was postponed due to concerns it would disrupt the Kyakhta trade. In 1849, Putyatin became Adjutant-General in the entourage of the Emperor, and in the same year married a daughter of a British admiral. He was promoted to vice admiral in 1851. In 1852, on learning of American plans to send Commodore Matthew Perry in an attempt to open Japan for foreign trade, the Russian government revived Putyatin's proposal, which received support from Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia. The expedition included several notable Sinologists and a number of scientists and engineers, as well as the noted author Ivan Goncharov. The frigate Pallada under the command of Ivan Unkovsky was selected as the flagship. Pallada departed Kronstadt on October 7, 1852; however it became clear during the long voyage that the vessel was unsuited for the expedition, and the newer 52-gun frigate Diana was subsequently dispatched. Putyatin arrived at Nagasaki in Japan on August 12, 1853 ‚Äì a month after the arrival of Perry at Uraga, and it was not until September 9 (after considerable discussion) that the Nagasaki bugy≈ç agreed to accept the official letter Putyatin carried from Russian Foreign Minister Count Karl Nesselrode. During one of the shore visits, the Russian engineer Alexander Mozhaysky demonstrated a steam engine, which enabled Japanese inventor Tanaka Hisashige to reverse engineer the device to create the first Japanese steam locomotive. As negotiations were protracted by Japanese indecision and the distance from Nagasaki to the Shogun's court at Edo, Putyatin departed Nagasaki to survey the coasts of Korea and the Primorsky Krai region of the Russian Far East. The frigate Diana arrived on July 11, 1854 with word of the Crimean War, and Putyatin transferred his flag to the newer vessel. Returning to Nagasaki, Putyatin found that no progress had been made, and that the Royal Navy had called on Nagasaki during his absence as part of a manhunt to destroy his vessel. He therefore decided to make good on his threat to sail for Edo itself. Putyatin arrived at the port of Shimoda on November 22, 1854, which had been opened to the Americans by the Convention of Kanagawa signed between the Japanese and the United States, and was permitted to start negotiations on December 22; however on December 23, the major Ansei Tokai earthquake shook Japan and surroundings. A 7-meter-high tsunami destroyed much of Shimoda including Putiatin's ships, with exception of Diana, which was badly damaged and sank soon afterwards at nearby Heda. The Russian delegation now found itself stranded in Japan. Negotiations continued, resulting in the Treaty of Shimoda on February 7, 1855, which opened the ports of Hakodate, Nagasaki and Shimoda to Russian vessels, permitted limited trading and the residence of a Russian consul, and fixed the border of Japan and Russia on the Kurile Islands between Urup and Iturup. In the meantime, the Russian sailors and technicians worked with Japanese carpenters to build a new vessel at Heda to enable the delegation to return to Russia. The schooner Heda was launched on April 14, and Putyatin returned to a hero's welcome in St Petersburg, where he was made a Count, and appointed military governor of Kronstadt from 1856 to 1857. In 1857, Putyatin was dispatched to China in an attempt to establish a trade agreement; however, he had only limited success after failing twice to cross the border into China by land and by sea. He returned to Japan again in the same year to sign a follow-on accord to his previous agreement. In December, he was appointed commander of the Russian Pacific squadron, and flew his flag on the paddle-wheel steam corvette America, further exploring the coast of Amur Bay. On July 12, 1858, he signed a trade agreement with China at Tianjin and allowing for the access to the interior of China by Russian missionaries. On August 7, 1858 he signed the Russo-Japanese Treaty of Friendship and Commerce in Edo, which opened more ports in Japan to Russian trade. Later years After his return to Russia on August 26, 1858, Putyatin was promoted to admiral and was assigned as an attach√© to London. He published a book on the subject of maritime training academies, and was appointed Minister of Education on July 2, 1861. While in this position, he conducted a number of reforms, including compulsory attendance at lectures. More controversially, he decided to turn primary education over to the scope of the Russian Orthodox Church by decreeing that teachers needed to have graduated from a two-year seminary. This led to rioting at a number of cities, and Putyatin was relieved of his post on January 6, 1862. However, he was also made an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and a member of the State Council of Imperial Russia. During his trip to London in 1845, Putyatin married Mary Knowles (1823-1879), whose father was a high-ranking naval official. They had three sons and three daughters. On the death of his wife on December 18, 1879, Putyatin left Russia for Paris. He was awarded the Order of St Andrew in May 1883, and died in Paris later that year in October.

Chikuma had two sister ships, and the . Chikuma was named for the Chikuma River in Nagano prefecture. Background The Chikuma-class protected cruisers were built as part of the 1907 Naval Expansion Program, based on lessons learned during the Russo-Japanese War. Chikuma was laid down at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan on 1 April 1909, launched on 1 April 1911 and entered service on 17 May 1912.Nishida, Ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy Design The basic design of the Chikuma-class cruisers was modeled after the Royal Navy with some modifications and was also largely influenced by the design of the cruiser Jentsura, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy; page 104-105 The silhouette of the Chikuma class was readily distinguishable due to its four tall smokestacks. Chikuma had a hull with an overall length of and width of , with a normal displacement of 5040 tons and draft of . Chikuma was propelled by two Curtis steam turbine engines (produced by Kawasaki, with a total capacity of , which drove two screws. The engine had 16 Kampon boilers. These newly developed engines gave the ship an incredible (for the time) speed in trials,Conway, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1905‚Äì1922, page 237 but problems with material strength in the gears of the new engines created a maintenance nightmare, and Chikuma could seldom live up to her potential. The ship was armed with eight 15 cm/45 41st Year Type guns, one each fore and aft, and three mounted in sponsons on each side of the hull. Ships of the Chikuma-class were unusual in having the same weapons for its side armament as for its main battery. These guns were supplemented by four QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval guns and two 7.7 mm Lewis Guns. In addition, she carried three torpedo launchers with torpedoes. After 1919, two 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun were added for anti-aircraft defense abeam of the fourth funnel, replacing three of the 12-pounders. Service record Chikuma participated in World War I, as part of Japan's contribution to the Allied war effort under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. She was in the Japanese squadron which gave chase to the German East Asia Squadron led by Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee in 1914. The Imperial Japanese Navy also dispatched the cruisers , Chikuma and to the Indian Ocean to deal with the threat posed to shipping by the German cruiser . From December 1914 to January 1915, Chikuma and Yahagi were assigned to patrols off the coast of northern Queensland, Australia and on 26 March 1917, the British Admiralty further requested the deployment of Chikuma and Hirado to Australia and New Zealand to protect shipping against German commerce raiding operations. After World War I, Chikuma was assigned to patrols of the China coast from 1921-1924. After 1924, she was deemed too obsolete to be of any further combat use, and was primarily used as a moored training ship at Yokosuka Naval District after having been officially transferred to the reserves. Chikuma was officially stricken from the navy list on 1 April 1931. Her hulk was designated Hai Kan No.3 and expended as a target in 1935.

Hirado had two sister ships, and . She was named for after the island of Hirado, Nagasaki. Background The Chikuma-class protected cruisers were built as part of the 1907 Naval Expansion Program, based on lessons learned during the Russo-Japanese War. Hirado was the last protected cruiser built for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Designed shortly after the Russo-Japanese War, she was laid down at Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation in Kobe on 10 August 1910, launched on 29 June 1911 and entered service on 17 June 1912. Design Hirado in 1912 The basic design of the Chikuma-class cruisers was modeled after the Royal Navy with some modifications and was also largely influenced by the design of the cruiser Jentsura, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy; page 104-105 The silhouette of the Chikuma class was readily distinguishable due to its four tall smokestacks. Hirado had a hull with an overall length of and width of , with a normal displacement of 5040 tons and draft of . Hirano was propelled by two Curtis steam turbine engines (produced by Kawasaki, with a total capacity of , which drove two screws. The engine had 16 Kampon boilers. These newly developed engines gave the ship an incredible (for the time) speed in trials,Conway, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1905‚Äì1922, page 237 but problems with material strength in the gears of the new engines created a maintenance nightmare, and Hirado could seldom live up to her potential. The ship was armed with eight 15 cm/45 41st Year Type guns, one each fore and aft, and three mounted in sponsons on each side of the hull. Ships of the Chikuma class were unusual in having the same weapons for their side armament as for their main battery. These gun were supplemented by four QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval guns and two 7.7 mm Lewis guns. In addition, she carried three torpedo launchers with torpedoes. After 1919, two 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun were added for anti-aircraft defense abeam of the fourth funnel, replacing three of the 12-pounders. Service record At Auckland, New Zealand in 1912 Hirado participated in World War I, as part of Japan's contribution to the Allied war effort under the Anglo- Japanese Alliance. She was in the Japanese squadron which gave chase to the German East Asia Squadron led by Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee in 1914. Hirado and Yahagi were in the Allied 2nd Southern Squadron led by the battleship and commanded by Rear-Admiral Matsumura Tatsuo, patrolling the region around Sumatra unsuccessfully for the German cruiser On 26 March 1917, the British Admiralty further requested the deployment of Chikuma and Hirado to Australia and New Zealand to protect shipping against German commerce raiding operations. Cockatoo Island, Sydney 8 May 1917. After the end of the war, Hirado was assigned to patrol off the east coast of Russia to provide protection and support for supply convoys to Japanese ground forces in Siberia during Japan‚Äôs Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army. During the inter-war period, future Fleet Admiral Osami Nagano was captain of Hirado from 1919-1920 (his only ship command),Tucker, World War II:An Encyclopedia, page 529 and by Captain Zengo Yoshida from March to December 1924. During the 1920s and 1930s, Hirado was mostly assigned to guarding the southern approaches to Japan, and made frequent port calls to Manila and Macau. From 1932, she was reassigned to patrol the northern coast of China, as relations between Japan and China continued to deteriorate after the Manchurian Incident, and she was based at Ryojun Guard District in the Kwantung Leased Territory. However, problems with her engines resulted in frequent stays in repair yards, and she was unable to participate in any combat operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Considered a reserve vessel in 1933 and used primarily for training thereafter, Hirado was officially stricken from the navy list on 1 April 1940. Re-designated Hai Kan No.11, the vessel was moored as a barracks ship at Etajima, and then Kure. She was towed to Iwasaki in December 1943. The hulk was scrapped from January through April 1947 by a Tokyo-based salvage company, becoming part of the breakwater at Iwakuni port.

The association's headquarters were originally in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, and now are in Alma, Illinois. Established in 1994, the association has about 2,500 members. Several categories of membership are available, including discounts for students. The association annually sponsors a variety of activities. Among them are regional events, nature photo competitions, and webinars throughout the United States. NANPA sponsored a Nature Photography Celebration in 2018 (Jackson, Wyoming). The NANPA Foundation [www.nanpafoundation.org], established in 1997, funds scholarships, photo blinds for wildlife photography, and grants for conservation photography projects, and to photography students. NANPA also markets books of interest to members, including those by members, through Amazon.com. NANPA's Summits, begun in 1995, bring together nature photography professionals from throughout the continent and the world. Recent Summits have been held in Jacksonville, Florida (2013 and 2017); San Diego, California (2015); and Las Vegas, Nevada (2019). Tucson, Arizona, is the site of the next Summit, scheduled for 2021. Each Summit features major presentations by distinguished people in the nature photography profession, an awards celebration, a trade show, portfolio reviews, workshops (breakout sessions), and vendor demonstrations. Lightning talks are featured at some Summits: a series of six-minute presentations by NANPA members on techniques, anecdotes, and related information. In 2006, NANPA initiated June 15 as Nature Photography Day. This designated day was spearheaded by the association‚Äôs History Committee. Its purpose is to promote the art and science of nature photography. NANPA looks to esthetic elements and practical ones, too. Photography has been used to rescue animals, plants, and habitats locally and worldwide. Participation in Nature Photography Day has since extended worldwide. June 15 is a day that encourages exploring, with a camera, the natural world within walking, hiking, biking, or rowing distance. Settings would be close by, for safety of participants and to avoid leaving a carbon footprint. Among the numerous ways to celebrate the day is to experiment with taking photographs of a familiar subject, turning the ordinary into something extraordinary. Another is to find something that detracts from the natural world, showing images about how human beings sometimes adversely affect the environment. NANPA also encourages participants to learn about the experiences of nature photographerslegends of the past and today. Advocacy In August 2019, the National Press Photographers Association and the American Society of Media Photographers filed an amicus brief in support of Jim Olive in University of Houston System vs. Jim Olive Photography, D/B/A Photolive, Inc. The brief was joined by the North American Nature Photography Association, Graphic Artists Guild, American Photographic Artists, and Professional Photographers of America. \\"The case began when Texas photographer Jim Olive discovered that the University of Houston was using one of his aerial photographs for marketing purposes without permission. When Olive asked the University to pay for the use, they refused and told him they were shielded from suit because of sovereign immunity, which protects state government entities from many lawsuits.\\" After a negative ruling from a Texas appellate court Olive hopes to continue his fight. In 2019, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari in Allen v. Cooper, raising the question of whether Congress validly abrogated state sovereign immunity via the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act in providing remedies for authors of original expression whose federal copyrights are infringed by states. Thirteen amici including; the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Recording Industry Association of America, the Copyright Alliance, the Software and Information Industry Association, the North American Nature Photography Association and the National Press Photographers Association, filed briefs in support of Allen. Those briefs proposed various doctrines under which the CRCA could validly abrogate sovereign immunity and variously re-asserted and supported the reasons why Congress examined and enacted CRCA, claiming that Congress was fair in finding that states had abused immunity and that an alternative remedy was needed. On November 5, 2019 the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Allen v. Cooper. A decision in the case is expected in the late spring of 2020.

The twin steel stringer bridge carries the Wilbur Cross Highway (Route 15/U.S. Route 5) over the river, connecting downtown Hartford with East Hartford. Named for Connecticut's famed Charter Oak, the original crossing opened as a toll bridge in the early 1940s, allowing through traffic to pass south of downtown Hartford. It was replaced by the current bridge in 1991, which is free to motorists. It has an average daily traffic of 79,800 motorists.  History  The first motor vehicle bridge across the Connecticut River at Hartford was the Bulkeley Bridge, which opened in 1908. In 1929 the Connecticut General Assembly passed an act creating a commission to study the need for a second bridge. The outcome was a proposed new bridge from Main and Pitkin Streets in East Hartford to Wyllys Street at Wethersfield Avenue in Hartford. In 1931 the commission hired a design consultant. The new design was an suspension span, with the eastern end shifted south to Main Street and Silver Lane. The project went to bid in 1933 and would cost $4.4 million. However, the Great Depression struck, banks were closed, and nothing further was done with the bridge until the decade was nearly over. With the opening of the Merritt Parkway in 1940 and the construction of the Wilbur Cross Highway underway, the General Assembly authorized a new bridge commission, this time for a toll bridge that would carry the area's first expressways across the Connecticut River. The commission studied several sites and arrived at a Silver Lane to Wawarme Avenue alignment. In late 1940, construction began. On December 4, 1941, disaster struck, when a section of the Charter Oak Bridge fell into the Connecticut River during construction. Sixteen men fell to their deaths in the icy river, and 606 tons of steel, including a 176-ton derrick, plummeted into the water. One body was never recovered. Sixteen other men were rescued by the Hartford fire department. Engineers later determined that the bridge section, erected over the water from the Hartford side, fell as a result of movement in the falsework, the temporary steel and wood structure used to support the bridge girders until enough had been erected to reach the next pier. The temporary support structure moved as a result of a shift in the unstable varved clay under the river. Despite the disaster, the bridge's builder, the American Bridge Company, ordered new steel the same day the bridge fell, and it was completed on time. The four-lane Charter Oak Bridge and approach highways opened to traffic on September 5, 1942. Tolls were collected in both directions at a plaza in East Hartford. When the bridge opened, it was the longest continuous plate girder bridge in the country. In 1948, the designation of state Route 15 was changed, to include a continuous planned expressway, complete in many places, from Greenwich to Union. This included the Merritt Parkway, the Berlin Turnpike, and the Charter Oak Bridge, forming at the time Connecticut's most advanced, prominent highway. The bridge carries US 5 to this day along with Route 15, but also carried U.S. Route 6 from 1943 to 1970. = A New Bridge = As traffic increased and the planned beltways (I-291 and I-491) were reduced in scope or cancelled entirely, the state paid particular attention to the overworked I-84/I-91 interchange and surrounding highways. What eventually came out of this was added responsibility for the Charter Oak Bridge; it would take over the connections previously served by the Founders Bridge and two tight ramps to I-91. At the same time, the Charter Oak was showing its age, both in materials and roadway design. After considering alternatives such as widening or adding a parallel span, the state decided to build a new bridge immediately to the south, and dismantle the old one. Work began in 1988 and the new bridge, free of tolls, opened to traffic on August 8, 1991, at a cost of $204 million. The new plate-girder bridge has several spans measuring in length, and has a vertical clearance of above the Connecticut River. It includes six lanes, two shoulders and a protected pedestrian walkway on its north side. = Approach Improvement Project = On June 9, 2015, Governor Dannel Malloy announced a five-year, $200 million construction project to rebuild the interchange between US-5/CT-15 and I-91 at the west end of the bridge. Although the interchange was rebuilt during the late 1980s and early 1990s along with the Charter Oak Bridge and the US-5/CT-15 portions of the Wilbur Cross Highway, traffic along the section has increased significantly since the reconstruction and the removal of the two connector ramps between I-91 and the Founders Bridge (CT-2), which is located further north, closer to Downtown Hartford. The Charter Oak Bridge took over these connections following its replacement in 1991, and became the main southeast bypass of Hartford for traffic traveling on I-91 and I-84. The project includes the replacement of the single-lane on-ramp from I-91 Northbound to CT-15 Northbound (Exit 29) with a double-lane ramp and the separation of the I-91 and CT-15 carriageways, which currently weave with each other for one mile approaching the interchange. These upgrades will improve connections between I-91 and I-84http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/governor-to-make-major- announcement-about-charter-oak-bridge/106383/ The Charter Oak Bridge itself is not being replaced, however.

The concept was introduced by Ilya Mikhailovich Lifshitz.  Definition  Frequently in physics one comes across situations where quenched randomness plays an important role. Any physical property X of such a system, would require an averaging over all disorder realisations. The system can be completely described by the average [X] where [...] denotes averaging over realisations (‚Äúaveraging over samples‚Äù) provided the relative variance RX = VX / [X]2 ‚Üí 0 as N‚Üí‚àû, where VX = [X2] ‚àí [X]2 and N denotes the size of the realisation. In such a scenario a single large system is sufficient to represent the whole ensemble. Such quantities are called self-averaging. Away from criticality, when the larger lattice is built from smaller blocks, then due to the additivity property of an extensive quantity, the central limit theorem guarantees that RX ~ N‚àí1 thereby ensuring self-averaging. On the other hand, at the critical point, the question whether X is self-averaging or not becomes nontrivial, due to long range correlations.  Non self-averaging systems  At the pure critical point randomness is classified as relevant if, by the standard definition of relevance, it leads to a change in the critical behaviour (i.e., the critical exponents) of the pure system. It has been shown by recent renormalization group and numerical studies that self-averaging property is lost if randomness or disorder is relevant. Most importantly as N ‚Üí ‚àû, RX at the critical point approaches a constant. Such systems are called non self-averaging. Thus unlike the self-averaging scenario, numerical simulations cannot lead to an improved picture in larger lattices (large N), even if the critical point is exactly known. In summary, various types of self-averaging can be indexed with the help of the asymptotic size dependence of a quantity like RX. If RX falls off to zero with size, it is self-averaging whereas if RX approaches a constant as N ‚Üí ‚àû, the system is non-self- averaging. Strong and weak self-averaging There is a further classification of self-averaging systems as strong and weak. If the exhibited behavior is RX ~ N‚àí1 as suggested by the central limit theorem, mentioned earlier, the system is said to be strongly self-averaging. Some systems shows a slower power law decay RX ~ N‚àíz with 0 < z < 1\\\\. Such systems are classified weakly self-averaging. The known critical exponents of the system determine the exponent z. It must also be added that relevant randomness does not necessarily imply non self-averaging, especially in a mean-field scenario. The RG arguments mentioned above need to be extended to situations with sharp limit of Tc distribution and long range interactions.

The Astrogeology Science Center is the entity within the United States Geological Survey concerned with the study of planetary geology and planetary cartography. It is housed in the Shoemaker Building in Flagstaff, Arizona. The Center was established in 1963 by Eugene Merle Shoemaker to provide lunar geologic mapping and to assist in training astronauts destined for the Moon as part of the Apollo program. Since its inception, the Astrogeology Science Center has participated in processing and analyzing data from various missions to the planetary bodies in the Solar System, assisting in finding potential landing sites for exploration vehicles, mapping our neighboring planets and their moons, and conducting research to better understand the origins, evolutions, and geologic processes operating on these bodies.Gerald G. Schaber, The U.S. Geological Survey, Branch of Astrogeology‚ÄîA Chronology of Activities from Conception through the End of Project Apollo (1960-1973), U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2005-1190 (2005).  The Early Days  Gene Shoemaker founded the Astrogeology Research Program August 25, 1960. The research program started out as the Astrogeologic Studies Group at the United States Geological Survey center in Menlo Park, California. The research program was moved to Flagstaff, Arizona (starting in December 1962 and completed in 1963). Flagstaff was chosen as the location due to its proximity to Meteor Crater and the volcanic craters and lava flows of the San Francisco volcanic field. Dr. Shoemaker retired from the USGS in 1993. He remained on Emeritus status with the USGS and maintained an affiliation with Lowell Observatory until his death in a car accident in Australia in 1997.David H. Levy, Shoemaker by Levy: The Man Who Made an Impact, Princeton Univ. Press, 303 pages (2000). Gene was involved in the Lunar Ranger and Surveyor programs and continued with the manned Apollo programs. He culminated his lunar studies in 1994 with new data on the Moon from Project Clementine, for which he was the science-team leader. Gene collaborated closely with his wife, Carolyn, a planetary astronomer. The discovery of Comet Shoemaker-Levy (which impacted Jupiter in 1994) with colleague David Levy, gained them worldwide fame. This was just one of Gene's many great accomplishments. Starting in 1963, the Astrogeology Science Center played an important role in training astronauts destined to explore the lunar surface and in supporting the testing of equipment for both manned and unmanned missions. As part of the astronauts' training, USGS and NASA geoscientists gave lectures and field trips during the 1960s and early 1970s to teach astronauts the basics of terrestrial and lunar geology. Field trips included excursions into the Grand Canyon to demonstrate the development of geologic structure over time; Lowell Observatory (Flagstaff), Kitt Peak National Observatory (Tucson) and the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station, NOFS (Flagstaff); Meteor Crater east of Flagstaff ; and Sunset Crater cinder cone and nearby lava flows in the Flagstaff area. This training was essential to giving astronauts the skills and understanding to make observations about what they would see on the lunar surface and to collect samples for later study back on Earth. The volcanic fields around Flagstaff have proven particularly useful in testing equipment and training astronauts. Cameras planned for use in the Surveyor project were tested on the Bonito Flow in Sunset Crater National Park because the lava flow appeared to be similar to flows on the lunar surface. A field of artificial impact craters was created in the Cinder Lakes volcanic field near Flagstaff to create a surface similar to the proposed first manned American landing site on the Moon. Jack Schmitt joined the Astrogeology team as a geologist at the Flagstaff Science Center in 1964, having recently earned a doctorate degree from Harvard University. In addition to assisting in the geologic mapping of the Moon, he led the Lunar Field Geological Methods project. When NASA announced a special recruitment for scientist-astronauts in late 1964, Schmitt applied. Out of more than 1,000 applicants, six were chosen. Of those six, Joe Kerwin, Owen Garriott, and Edward Gibson would fly in the Skylab missions in 1973 and 1974, and Schmitt would go to the Moon on the Apollo 17 mission.

Yahagi had two sister ships, and . She was named after the Yahagi River, which runs through Nagano, Gifu and Aichi prefectures. Background The Chikuma-class light cruisers were built as part of the 1907 Naval Expansion Program, based on lessons learned during the Russo-Japanese War. Yahagi was laid down at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Nagasaki on 20 June 1910, launched on 3 October 1911 and entered service on 27 July 1912. Design Yahagi had a hull with an overall length of and width of , with a normal displacement of 5040 tons and draft of . Yahagi was propelled by two Parsons steam turbine engines, with a total capacity of , which drove two screws. The engine had 16 Kampon boilers, which exhausted though four tall smokestacks. These newly developed engines gave the ship an incredible (for the time) speed,Conway, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1905‚Äì1922, page 237 but problems with material strength in the gears of the new engines created a maintenance nightmare, and Yahagi could seldom live up to her potential. The ship was armed with eight 15 cm/45 41st Year Type guns, one each fore and aft, and three mounted in sponsons on each side of the hull. Ships of the Chikuma class were unusual in having the same weapons for its side armament as for its main battery. These gun were supplemented by four QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval guns and two 7.7 mm Lewis guns. In addition, she carried three torpedo launchers with torpedoes. After 1919, two 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun were added for anti-aircraft defense abeam of the fourth funnel, replacing three of the 12-pounders. Service record Yahagi in 1912 Yahagi participated in World War I as part of Japan's contribution to the Allied war effort under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. She was in the Japanese squadron which gave chase to the German East Asia Squadron led by Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee in 1914. Hirado and Yahagi were in the Allied 2nd Southern Squadron led by the battleship and commanded by Rear-Admiral Matsumura Tatsuo, patrolling the region around Sumatra unsuccessfully for the German cruiser From December 1914 to January 1915, Chikuma and Yahagi were assigned to patrols off the coast of northern Queensland, Australia. On 7 February 1917 the Imperial Japanese Navy formed the First Special Squadron which composed the cruisers Yahagi, , and , together with the Second Destroyer Flotilla. This squadron was based at Singapore and commanded by Rear Admiral Kozaburo Oguri. On 26 March 1917, the British Admiralty further requested the deployment of Chikuma and Hirado to Australia and New Zealand to protect shipping against German commerce raiding operations. Yahagi and Suma were ordered to the Indian Ocean to continue cooperation with the British China Squadron, and with Tsushima and Niitaka proceeded to Mauritius. Yahagi continued to patrol the eastern coasts of Australia and New Zealand from May to October 1917. Yahagi, the last ship deployed by Japan to defend Australia and New Zealand, sailed from Sydney back to Japan on 21 October 1918. Yahagi from USS Black Hawk (AD-9) circa 1932, possibly in Manila Bay, Philippines The crew of Yahagi became stricken with influenza during the Great Influenza Epidemic of December 1918, and had to make an emergency port call at Manila harbor for 46 days, during which time 300 of her crew were incapacitated, and 48 died. After the end of the war, Yahagi was assigned to patrol off the coast of eastern Russia to provide protection and support for supply convoys to Japanese ground forces in Siberia during Japan's Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army. Afterwards, Yahagi was mostly assigned to guarding the southern approaches to Japan, and made frequent port calls to Manila and Macau. From 1923-1937, Yahagi was used for patrols in the inland waters of China, replacing the cruiser as a station ship on the Yangtze River. After the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, she was considered a reserve vessel and was used primarily as a moored training ship. Stricken from the navy list on 1 April 1940 and re-designated Hai Kan No.12 at the Etajima Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, she served as a barracks ship for submarine crews until 1943. The hulk was scrapped from 31 January 1947 to 8 July 1947.

Although it is a first-person shooter and many of the graphics and sounds have been ported from Duke Nukem 3D, the game has an original storyline and levels. Four difficulty levels can be selected at the beginning of the game. Multiplayer games are possible, with up to four players requiring a copy. An option to save one's progress appears at the completion of each level, with five save game slots to choose from. Storyline Duke Nukem, working for General Graves, is asked to investigate Area 51, after reports indicate the hostile infiltration of an alien species. After getting rid of much of the alien threat there, Duke learns about how the aliens require \\"environmental regulators\\" to exist, and follows them to the Temple of Amun in Egypt. While in Egypt, Duke Nukem discovers a vast collection of alien hybrid creatures in stasis, apparently an army meant to take over the world. A nearby power source detected by General Graves seems to supply their environmental regulators, so Duke is sent to shut it down. Subsequently, he learns that activating an override pump will drain the hibernation tanks, killing the entire alien hybrid army. Nukem also manages to destroy the controller alien overseeing the stasis area, but it turns out that the alien activated a self-destruct sequence just before his death. Duke manages to narrowly escape the collapsing temple, using one of the alien transporters to get away. Having re-establishing contact with the general, Duke Nukem discovers he has materialized in Sydney, Australia. Graves tells him to find one of the agency's undercover agents, who has sent out a distress call from a nearby nightclub. After rescuing the agent, Duke locates a doomsday weapon being created by the aliens. The controller alien in Egypt had mentioned it to be able to wipe out Earth's atmosphere, so Nukem is quickly sent to destroy the device. Once successful, he transports on board the orbiting alien spaceship. Once Duke establishes his signal with General Graves, he learns that he must hack into the spaceship's system to find a weakness. After transmitting all the data from the ship he can find, Graves tells him they have detected four human females on board which Duke must once again rescue. He finds the first one and teleports her back to Earth, and after analysis, the general learns that she is in fact a cloned version of their undercover agent, Jenny. Duke deducts that the aliens are using the clones to help propagate their species. By the time Duke has rescued the Jennys one by one, his General friend informs him that he can destroy the ship by shutting down its engine's coolant system. He does just that, then teleports \\"Jenny 5\\" back to Earth. The General's teleportation system is unable to beam out Duke Nukem too, however, requiring him to wade through more alien assailants in order to transport out using their teleporters. The ship subsequently blows up, and Duke Nukem arrives safely back on Earth. Controls Since the Game Boy Advance has a limited number of controls, the game offers four different control setups. These set the buttons for shooting, jumping, strafing, weapon selection and looking up and down. When pausing the game, the player can also view the level's map. The player can pan around the map, as well as zoom in or out. Some of the level's secrets can also be discovered simply by looking at the map. Reception Duke Nukem Advance received \\"generally favourable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Craig Harris of IGN called it \\"without a doubt the most fun first-person shooter on the GBA to date.\\" Frank Provo of GameSpot said: \\"On the basis of technical merit, Duke Nukem Advance is nowhere near as pretty or diverse as the original 1996 PC game, but it's easily the best FPS to hit the GBA since Doom.\\" Martin Taylor of Eurogamer said: \\"It breaks no new ground in gaming conventions, and it won't keep you playing for months, but it looks good and it plays well, which is more than can be said for some of its competition.\\" References External links *Official site * 2002 video games Duke Nukem First-person shooters Game Boy Advance games Game Boy Advance-only games Video games developed in Australia Take-Two Interactive games Video games with 2.5D graphics Sprite based First-person shooters ","title":"Duke Nukem Advance"},{"id":"5782432","text":"The Arrigoni Bridge, also known locally as the Portland Bridge is a steel through arch bridge carrying Route 66 and Route 17 across the Connecticut River, connecting Middletown, Connecticut to Portland, Connecticut. When it opened in 1938, the bridge was the most expensive bridge ever built in Connecticut, at a cost of $3.5 million. Its two distinctive steel arches have the longest span length of any bridge in the state. The bridge has an average daily traffic of 33,600.2005 State of Connecticut Department of Transportation Traffic Volumes State Maintained Highway Network Traffic Log (pdf) It was named after state legislator Charles J. Arrigoni, who promoted the project. Arrigoni served in the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1933-1936 and in the Connecticut State Senate from 1937-1940. History Portland and East Hampton, jointly known as Chatham until Portland separated in 1841, were originally part of the vast settlement of Middletown in 1652. Middletown families settled the towns east of the Connecticut River, and until the latter half of the 19th century, the only way to cross the river was via ferry. The first ferry service in Middletown began operation in 1726. The first bridge spanning the Connecticut River at Middletown was a swing truss bridge opened in 1872 carrying the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. Still in active service, it is now known as the Providence & Worcester railroad bridge. When the first non-railroad bridge in the area opened in 1896, it was said to be the longest highway drawbridge in the world at the time. Known as the Portland Passenger Bridge, it was built by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company for $180,000, and measured in length and had a draw span of . It provided a roadway and an electric passenger car, accommodated foot traffic, and charged tolls for the crossing. The Portland Passenger Bridge was heavily damaged by flooding in 1936.McDougall, Robert W., Portland, p 7, Arcadia Publishing, 2004, , retrieved via Google Books on January 16, 2009 =A New Bridge= As motor traffic increased in the early 1900s, drivers clamored for a way to cross the river without being interrupted to let marine traffic pass through. Studies for a new bridge date back to at least 1933, when the state was calling it the Route 346 Bridge. Construction on a new bridge began in 1936. Once the Arrigoni Bridge was completed in 1938, the old drawbridge was demolished. That same year, the Arrigoni Bridge won the American Institute of Steel Construction's first prize of \\"Most Beautiful Steel Bridge\\" in the large bridge category.The Hartford Courant, April 25, 2007, Middlesex County Advertising Supplement, page 7 The choice of large steel through arches for this location, with the roadway suspended from the arches by cables, allowed wide navigation channels on the river, minimized pier construction, and provided a profile to the bridge that was aesthetically pleasing. By replacing the old drawbridge with a high-level crossing (the bridge provides more than of clearance above the river), the Arrigoni Bridge foreshadowed subsequent major highway crossings of Connecticut's navigable rivers. From a technical standpoint, the bridge exemplifies the long-span bridge engineering of the first half of the 20th century. Because of the growing need to provide uninterrupted highway passage over large bodies of water, engineers increasingly were called upon to design large cantilevered trusses, suspension bridges, and steel arches. Innovative erection methods, the availability of very large structural components, and special metals all contributed to the development of long-span bridge technology. For example, nearly a third of the Arrigoni Bridge utilized high-strength silicon steel, and the bridge was almost entirely erected by building the arches outward from the center pier, letting them balance each other as they were extended over the water. Another notable engineering feature are the chains of huge eyebars under the roadway that tie together the ends of each arch; the tied-arch technique resisted the outward horizontal thrust of the arches and thus allowed the piers to be much smaller and more economical.

There are two common types of camp followers; first, the wives and children of soldiers, who follow their spouse or parent's army from place to place; the second type of camp followers have historically been informal army service providers, servicing the needs of encamped soldiers, in particular selling goods or services that the military does not supply‚Äîthese have included cooking, laundering, liquor, nursing, sexual services and sutlery.Holmes 2001, p. 170. History From the beginning of organized warfare until the end of the 19th century, European and American armies heavily depended on the services of camp followers. These services included delivery and preparation of provisions and transportation of supplies, which augmented the official military support structure.It included civilian merchants, contractors and teamsters, as well as family members such as wives, attached to the troops. Camp followers usually accompanied the baggage train and they often outnumbered the army itself, adding to its logistical problems.Holmes 2001, p. 171. Camp followers were both a support and drain on an army as they provided valuable services but also increased difficulties in logistics and security. Soldiers' wives washed, sewed, nursed and even acted as servants. However, camp followers needed to be fed, clothed, transported and guarded. They also had to be policed; camp followers could be among the most determined scavengers and looters after battles and whilst on the march. From the middle of the 19th century on, the creation of organized and resourced transport, medical, ordnance and supply corps as an integral part of regular armies marked the end of reliance on camp followers in most European armies. However, in much of the world the concept of numerous civilian workers, family members and hangers-on accompanying armies survived into the 20th century, either for reasons of local culture or in the absence of formal support services. A notable example was the Mexican Revolution of 1910‚Äì1920, where female soldaderas filling traditional camp roles, carrying equipment and often acting as combatants were a marked feature of Zapatista, Villistas and Federal forces at all times. =United States= In the military history of the United States camp followers were important in servicing and supplying the army during the Revolutionary War. There were also camp followers on both the Union and Confederate sides of the American Civil War. However, a major difference between the armies of the American Revolution and the Civil War was the presence of women and children. By the time of the Civil War, camps and campaigns included far fewer wives, children and other relatives of soldiers. Women still served as nurses in hospitals and in other limited support roles, but were not present in the same way in the earlier war. During the 19th century, members of Plains Indians who set up camp outside U.S. military forts or Indian agencies became known disparagingly as \\"loafers\\", or \\"loaf-around-the-fort Indians\\" or \\"hang-around-the-fort Indians\\".https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/cartoons/hang-around-fort- indians/ They along with the Indian scouts were seen by settlers as appeasing and docile, in stark contrast with the fierce and capable warriors whom the soldiers had to fight. Today's military operations in combat zones, such as the Iraq War that began with US invasion in 2003 or the Afghan War that began in 2001, feature extensive roles played by civilian contractors in providing logistic support for the armed forces. This has led journalists and historians to liken the phenomenon to that of camp followers. Contemporary usage \\"Camp-follower\\" has also been used to describe the modern families of military personnel who accompany soldiers while traveling; either during active military campaigns (more common in less-developed countries), or during peacetime military deployments (more common in developed countries), especially moving from military base to military base in a nomadic lifestyle (more common in developed countries). Modern camp-follower children are now more often called military brats in several English-speaking countries. In the United States, Canada and Great Britain, the term refers specifically to the mobile children of career soldiers, who traditionally have been camp or base followers.Wertsch 1992. In the United States this practice of base-following, or camp-following, dates all the way back to the beginning of the Republic.Musil 2005. Some work has also been done to document and describe military brat subcultures from other English speaking countries as well.

History The magazine is published four times a year, and is independently owned and edited by Eric T. Miller. Music magazines with a similar focus in the 1990s era included Option, Ray Gun, and Alternative Press. The first issue of Magnet came out in mid-1993. Examples of cover stars over the years include Yo La Tengo (1993, 2000), The Afghan Whigs (1994), Spacemen 3 (1997), Shudder To Think (1997), Tortoise/ Swervedriver (1998), Sonic Youth (1998), Sunny Day Real Estate (1998), Ween (2000), Ride (2002), Interpol (2003), H√ºsker D√º (2005), and Cat Power (2007). The magazine's content tends to focus on up-and-coming indie bands and expositions of various music scenes. Examples include long pieces on the Denton, TX psychedelic rock scene (1997), the New York City \\"Illbient\\" scene (1997), the history of power pop (2002), the Cleveland avant-punk scene of the 1970s, the Minneapolis college-rock scene of the 1980s (2005), the California \\"Paisley Underground\\" bands of the 1980s (2001), and the resurgence of the Shoegaze movement (2002). Also common is the \\"artists within a construct\\" theme‚Äîe.g., the \\"Eccentrics And Dreamers\\" issue (2003) featuring various \\"outsider\\" artists. Beginning in early 1997, subscribers to each issue receive a sampler CD. Record labels pay the magazine to have songs put on the CDs, meaning that inclusion signified no endorsement from the staff of Magnet, although bands would claim otherwise, leading to moderate controversy over the years. The songs on the CDs sometimes have little to do with the type of music covered by the magazine. Though the magazine's focus for the first five years or so of its existence was experimental/underground music, its focus at the turn of the century broadened to include an emphasis on covering alt-country and indie acts such as Wilco, Steve Earle, The New Pornographers, The Shins, and even more established acts such as Tom Petty. Despite this, it still maintains a section devoted to free jazz and obscure electronic-based music in each issue. It has also done long articles on jazz icons Albert Ayler, Ken Vandermark, and Ornette Coleman. The photographic style of subjects has also evolved from inventive avant-garde settings to stark, no-frills closeups of band members. Magnet has paid much less attention over the years to the metal and rap genres. The first issue of each year features a faux-retrospective look on that year, predicting various absurdist musical occurrences; this is always penned by Phil Sheridan. More recently, Andrew Earles has written a parodic feature entitled \\"Where's The Street Team?\\" which tends to address overhyped bands and their fans. The magazine stopped being offered in print form after the 80th edition but continued to use the Magnet brand name on their website. In October 2011 it returned as a monthly print magazine featuring Wilco on the cover of the first of the relaunch issues. There appears to be no free CD.

Founded in 1968, the practice has a broad portfolio of work including arts, commercial offices, residential, masterplanning and leisure and is particularly known for its work in education. It has received many national awards including over 30 RIBA Awards, together with the RIBA Sustainability Award. For its commercial work it has been awarded 9 BCO Awards, British Council for Offices. The practice designed the George Davies Centre, at the University of Leicester, currently the largest (non-domestic) building in the UK to be Passivhaus accredited. It is also responsible for the design and delivery of Bartholomew Barn, the UK's first \\"multi-comfort\\" building, a benchmark pioneered by Saint Gobain. The building has set a new bar for sustainable architecture.  History  The practice was formed by Malcolm Booth, Richard Slawson and Walter Thomson, who met as teachers at the Birmingham School of Architecture in the 1960s. At that time the School undertook live projects and the founders were encouraged to set up a part-time practice, employing students to undertake the work with appropriate management. The work was soon supplemented with private commissions and the move of the School from Aston University prompted the partners to commit to full-time practice in 1973. The practice name was conceived as having a life beyond the founders, its name Associated Architects chosen deliberately not to include their surnames. The early workload of housing, industrial buildings and offices expanded and the practice relocated in 1976 to St. Paul's Square, which it used as a base for the regeneration of the Jewellery Quarter. It developed skills in urban regeneration, with listed buildings and in urban housing, anticipating the city living movement by a decade. Paul Lister joined the practice in 1976, becoming a partner in 1984: Ian Standing joined in 1985 and became a partner in 1989. At this time the practice undertook its first projects with independent schools, developing this into a broad education workload. It won its first RIBA Awards and with the Property Services Agency undertook commissions for Law Courts at Stafford and Worcester, opening a Cyprus office to deliver projects for the Ministry of Defence. University work developed at this time with projects including the Birmingham School of Jewellery and the restoration of the Grade I listed Birmingham School of Art. As the National Lottery made funds available for Arts projects in the 1990s, the practice won national competitions for projects including the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra Centre (with Sir Simon Rattle), the Water Hall Gallery and the rebuilding of the Birmingham Hippodrome. Following its work on the first mixed use building at 9 Brindleyplace it built numerous offices and subsequently delivered the largest mixed use building in the UK: the Mailbox. Matthew Goer joined in 1990 and became a partner in 2001. The founders retired between 1996 and 2002 and Paul Lister retired in 2006. Warren Jukes and Adam Wardle joined in 1996 and with Matthew Goer and Ian Standing became directors of the Limited Liability Partnership in 2003. During 2012 James Hall was promoted to Director and Richard Perry to Director in 2014. Ian Standing retired 2016 having served over 30 years. Adam Wardle died unexpectedly in June 2013, at the age of 42. His obituary appeared in the RIBA Journal. Associated Architects retains its close relationship with the School of Architecture and has strong links with the cultural and business communities in the city. Although based in Birmingham and deriving much of its work from the region, it also works nationally and internationally.

Early contributions to the development of veterinary education in Scotland. Veterinary History, 16, 10-40. (http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/5263) The first regular classes at the school were begun in November 1823,Macdonald, A.A., Warwick, C. & Johnston, W.T. 2005. Locating veterinary education in Edinburgh in the nineteenth century. Book of the Old Edinburgh Club, New Series, 6, 41-71. (http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/2199) although lectures to small groups of students had been provided for four years prior to this date. That first session of regular classes was financed by student fees and a grant from the Highland Society of Scotland at Edinburgh,The Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland; http://www.rhass.org.uk of which John Barclay was a director. Mary Dick, William's elder sister, was reputed to have been instrumental, from the early days, in the administration of the school. Although an autonomous institution, the students also attended the lectures in (human) medicine at the University of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. =Clyde Street= In 1833, William Dick, who was by then a successful veterinary practitioner and teacher, paid for construction of purpose-built accommodation near the site of his father‚Äôs forge in a Clyde Street courtyard. William lived adjacent at 15 Clyde Street. (Today Multrees Walk is approximately where Clyde Street was.Robert Kirkwood 1819 map) This was the base for the school until it moved to its next site at Summerhall in 1916. In 1839, his school officially became a college and William Dick was given the title professor. By the time of Dick's death in 1866, the over 2000 students he had taught were to be found throughout the world. Among them were the founders of veterinary schools in Australia, Canada, Ireland and the United States. On his death, Dick bequeathed his college in trust to the Burgh Council of Edinburgh. It was officially named Dick‚Äôs Veterinary College following a request made by his sister, in 1873, in response to a crisis caused by the establishment of the rival New Veterinary College set up by alumnus and former Principal William Williams. Williams had taken with him the majority of the students, and the library. The two schools existed amicably within 100 m of one another in Edinburgh‚Äôs New Town until 1904, when the Williams' school moved to Liverpool, England, forming the basis of the University of Liverpool Faculty of Veterinary Science. The Royal (Dick) Veterinary College was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1906. =Summerhall= Orlando Charnock Bradley was principal of the Dick Vet when it moved in 1916 to the south side of Edinburgh, to another purpose-designed building, at Summerhall.Warwick, C.M. and Macdonald, A.A. 2010.

Reorganisation of the university in 2002 resulted in the abolishment of Faculties, and the Dick Vet once again became The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, one of the four Schools within the College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine. In 2009, Scottish Television filmed a five-part documentary at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.https://www.scotsman.com/news-2-15012/tv-crew-films- life-at-edinburgh-s-royal-dick-vet-school-1-1223659 Some of the cases shown on the documentary follow a wild swan needing an endoscopy, a horse in emergency colic surgery, a skunk being neutered, a chameleon with an eye infection, and the removal of a tumour near a cat‚Äôs heart.http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/all- news/vets-080410 STV filmed a second documentary in 2010. Since 2013, Summerhall is now a major international art museum and arts hub which has exhibited over 200 artists in two years as well as many theatre, music and literature events in the building. Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies Main Building, Easter Bush Campus =Easter Bush Veterinary Campus= In 2011, the Summerhall site was vacated and the staff and students were relocated to a new teaching building on the Easter Bush campus, south of the City centre. For the first time since 1962, all the veterinary facilities, together with the Roslin Institute, were consolidated onto one campus.  The Easter Bush Veterinary Campus  The Easter Bush Veterinary Campus is one of four campuses owned and operated by the University of Edinburgh and is approximately 7 miles south of Edinburgh city centre. The campus sits south of the Pentland Hills and can be accessed from the A702 and A703. The faculty's undergraduate degree in Veterinary Medicine (BVM&S;) is accredited by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in the UK, by the American Veterinary Medical Association in North America, the European Association of Establishments for Veterinary Education (EAEVE), The Australasian Veterinary Boards Council (AVBC) and The South African Veterinary Council. As well as university buildings, the campus holds the Arcadia @ Easter Bush nursery, for children aged 0 to 5. = History of the Easter Bush Campus = Historically, the site on which the Easter Bush campus sits was agricultural land. The first mention of ‚ÄòBush‚Äô which related to the near-by Bush Estate, and the Category A listed Bush House which lay at its centre, was recorded on maps as early as 1812. Buildings at Bush Home Farm and Easter Bush appeared by 1892. The University of Edinburgh purchased the Bush and Dryden estates in 1947, allocating the land around the farmstead at Easter Bush to the Veterinary College for livestock practical teaching In 1962, the university opened a Veterinary Field Station and Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine on the land to the south of Home Farm at Easter Bush. These buildings housed clinical teaching facilities, research laboratories and offices as well as lecture theatres, seminar rooms, a refectory and a gym. The Hospital for Small Animals opened in 1999 and in 2002 the University purchased Langhill Farm, sited just 2 miles from Easter Bush, it provided improved livestock facilities for the 220 strong herd of dairy cows. The land that had previously been occupied by the livestock, was able to be re-developed, and in 2003 the Equine and Large Ruminant Hospitals opened. In 2005, the University of Edinburgh approved a detailed proposal to relocate all of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies teaching activities to a purpose built new building amongst the schools animal hospitals at Easter Bush and in 2011 the William Dick building and Roslin Institute building opened on campus. = The William Dick Building = The William Dick Building, was opened for teaching in September 2011 by HRH Princess Royal and sits on the Easter Bush Campus. It contains purpose built facilities for veterinary teaching, including a clinical skills laboratory, anatomy facilities and two lecture theatres. It holds a canteen which is open to staff, students and the general public. = The Roslin Institute = The Roslin Institute was integrated into the University of Edinburgh in 2008 and in 2011 the completion of a new purpose- built research building on the Easter Bush Campus, saw it move the majority of its research to the campus. = The Dick Vet Hospital for Small Animals = The Dick Vet Hospital for Small Animals was opened in 1999 and is the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies main small animal clinical facility. It offers both first opinion services, through the Dick Vet General Practice, as well as referral services to referring veterinary clinicians. It has a range of specialist services, which include: Anaesthesia, Cardiopulmonary, Dermatology, Diagnostic Imaging, Emergency and Critical Care, The Feline Clinic, Internal Medicine, Interventional Radiology, Neurology and Neurosurgery, Ophthalmology, Orthopaedic Surgery, Soft Tissue Surgery, the Dick Vet Rabbit and Exotic Practice and the Riddell-Swann Veterinary Cancer Centre. = Equine Veterinary Services = Equine Veterinary Services consists of the Dick Vet Equine Practice, which offers first opinion care to horses, and the Dick Vet Equine Hospital. Within the Dick Vet Equine Hospital are a number of specialist services, including: Medicine, Orthopaedics, Soft Tissue Surgery, Reproduction, Farriery, anaesthesia, Diagnostic Imaging and Behaviour. = The Jeanne Marchig International Centre for Animal Welfare Education = The Jeanne Marchig International Centre for Animal Welfare Education (JMICAWE) is a hub of expertise on animal welfare education, collaborating with international universities, governments, charities and NGO partners to advance the understanding of animal welfare issues. Recent projects have included investing in the Clinical Skills Lab at the Dick Vet School, providing students with animal alternatives on which to practice; including a new equine colic simulator. They have also developed a new online Masters programme in International Animal Welfare, Ethics and Law which joins the on-campus Masters in Applied Animal Behaviour and Animal Welfare. These programmes are supported by The Scottish Rural College allowing students to benefit from being taught by many of the best animal welfare experts in the country. = The National Avian Research Facility = In September 2013, the National Avian Research Facility was opened on the Easter Bush campus in partnership with The Pirbright Institute. NARF's mission is to improve the productivity, health and welfare of poultry through research on host-pathogen interactions, avian genetics, development and physiology using state-of-the- art technologies. = The Charnock Bradley Building = The Charnock Bradley Building is a hub for the Easter Bush Campus, providing a home for the Roslin Innovation Centre, Easter Bush Science Outreach Centre (EBSOC) and the Easter Bush Gym. Opened in May 2018 by HRH Princess Royal the building contains office and laboratory space. Located in front of the building sits Canter a sculpture by Andy Scot, who is best known for The Kelpies. it was unveiled in May 2018 at the same time as the building opened and the 15ft steel statue of a horse‚Äôs head forms the centrepiece of the entrance plaza.  The Roslin Innovation Centre  The Roslin Innovation Centre provides office and laboratory space for tenant companies, university spin outs and early-stage entrepreneurs. Its laboratories and office spaces have been designed to be subdivided into different configurations, allowing for companies of all sizes to occupy the space. There are 285 laboratory workstations and space for 380 scientists and support staff.  Easter Bush Science Outreach Centre  The Easter Bush Science Outreach Centre (EBSOC) was opened on the 1st May 2018 by HRH Princess Royal. EBSOC is a purpose built teaching laboratory, which offers interactive curriculum linked learning experiences for school pupils and community groups. It is supported by scientists from across the Easter Bush Campus, who discuss their current research with the children, to help relate their learning to real life scientific research. The centre is managed by Dr Nicola Stock and staffed by a dedicated team, who design the activities.

The two self-propelled artillery vehicles are the 15 cm Panzerwerfer 42 auf Selbstfahrlafette Sd.Kfz.4/1 (based on the Opel Maultier, or \\"mule\\", half-track) and 15 cm Panzerwerfer 42 auf Schwerer Wehrmachtsschlepper (or Panzerwerfer auf SWS).  Development  The Panzerwerfer 42 auf Maultier, Sd.Kfz. 4/1, first went into production in April 1943, and was produced until March 1945. Hitler called for production of the vehicle in January 1942, and the vehicle saw its first tests on the Eastern Front in fall of 1943. Opel was the main manufacturer, producing most of the components, including the 3.6 liter, 6 cylinder Adam Opel engine, which had 68 horsepower and an 80-liter fuel capacity. Throughout the three years it was produced, 300 Panzerwerfers and 289 of its variant, the Munitionskraftwagen, were made.Stephan Ward, Panzerwerfer 42 auf Maultier in Action. Missing- lynx.com  Combat history  = Campaign in the Soviet Union = The Panzerwerfer 42 auf Maultier was used for larger scale rocket barrages against Soviet positions where a large bombardment of a big area would be more effective than more accurate artillery fire. The Panzerwerfer's rocket barrages covered much larger areas and added more psychological elements to the fight: the amount of noise, smoke, splinters, and flying debris as the rockets hit and exploded was considerable. The extensive use on the Eastern Front showed that this weapon could be employed effectively on the Western Front as well. The weapon was finally introduced throughout the army on May 14, 1944, in France.Stephan Ward, Panzerwerfer 42 auf Maultier in Action. Missing-lynx.com = Campaign in France = The western Allies first went into action against the Panzerwerfer 42 after D-Day. American intelligence before D-Day pointed to the use of rocket launchers such as the Nebelwerfer by the German Wehrmacht, but they were unprepared for the effects of a mobile, armored, camouflaged, and highly destructive rocket launcher mounted on a half-track chassis. The British and Canadians were the first of the western Allies to see the German rocket launchers in action against troop concentrations and Allied positions. The 7th Werfer Brigade, made up of the 83rd and 84th Regiments, was sent to Normandy from Beauvais after D-Day, and on June 10 it was in Falaise; the next day, it was about 10 kilometers from Caen. The unit was part of the attack on the Orne Bridge, which was a British held position over the Orne River. The 84th Regiment of the brigade had fourteen combat ready Panzerwerfers, and the 83rd had about the same. Some other Werfer units were the 101st SS Werfer Abteilung, 101st Stellungs-Werfer Regiment, and the 102nd SS Werfer Abteilung, which was part of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich. The 7th Werfer Brigade fired 8,000 tons of ammunition, notably onto Hill 112 (during Operation Jupiter) in support of its recapture by German forces on June 30.Ian Hogg (1976). Nebelwerfer, p. 5. . The British were usually at the receiving end of the Panzerwerfers rockets in Normandy, but the 15 cm Nebelwerfers were used in large numbers against American, British, and Canadian troops throughout the summer of 1944.Stephan Ward, Panzerwerfer 42 auf Maultier in Action. Missing-lynx.com = Ardennes and Berlin = The Battle of the Bulge saw intensive use of German armored rocket launchers. The most concentrated, massed salvos were used in the Ardennes region of Belgium in 1944 during the weeks of the German offensive. Panzerwerfers saw extensive use during April and May 1945, as the Soviets were quickly advancing on Berlin and the German forces employed rocket artillery in a defensive mode. Rocket launchers were used in large numbers defending positions inside of Germany and close to Berlin as the Soviets advanced from the east and the Allies from the west.Stephan Ward, Panzerwerfer 42 auf Maultier in Action. Missing-lynx.com  Vehicle performance and weapon specifications  The Panzerwerfer 42 auf Maultier weighed 7.1 tonnes, was six meters long, two meters wide, and nearly three meters high. It was capable of reaching speeds of up to 40 km/h. One of these half tracked vehicles generally carried a Nebelwerfer 41 launching system, which was specially designed to be mounted on the Opel-engine powered Panzerwerfer. The German engineers designed this system because of the conspicuous trails of smoke left behind by the Nebelwerfer batteries, which necessitated a self-propelled artillery piece for quick relocation after firing. The system contained 10 missile tubes, and generally carried 20 projectiles, enough for the vehicle to fire two full salvos. The effective range for a Panzerwerfer's rockets was about 4,000-6,500 meters, and the maximum range was less than 7,000.Stephan Ward, Panzerwerfer 42 auf Maultier in Action. Missing-lynx.com Though intended to provide fire support and operate well behind the point of contact, some Panzerwerfers also had a machine gun mounted above the cab for protection against infantry attack.  Reputation  Known as the \\"Moaning Minnie\\" by Allied soldiers for the distinctive noise the rockets made when fired, it was less accurate than a dedicated artillery piece, but its ability to saturate an area with fire and its psychological effects on infantry made it a valuable asset.

Over thirty years his work has spanned composition, performance, installation, video, printmaking and photography. Biography Sch√ºtze was born in Melbourne, Australia. He spent his childhood painting and drawing but left Caulfield Institute after only two months of an Arts Foundation Course to work in a factory. There he earned the money to buy his first electronic musical equipment. In 1979 he spent several months travelling and ended up in London where he immersed himself in concerts, museums and galleries. Returning to Melbourne he formed seminal improvising group Laughing Hands with Gordon Harvey, Ian Russell and Paul Widdicombe. The group existed in several forms until disbanding in 1982. Sch√ºtze spent the next decade writing scores for films. His first feature soundtrack, The Tale of Ruby Rose (1987), won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best original Music Score. During this period Sch√ºtze lectured on film sound at both Swinburne Institute and AFTRS and worked as a film critic both in print and on national radio. In collaboration with Michael Trudgeon, Anthony Kitchener and Dominic Lowe, Sch√ºtze curated and featured in Deus Ex Machina, an ambitious exhibition- publication at Monash University in 1989. This was to be his first sound installation and subsequently his first solo album. In 1992 Sch√ºtze re-located to London during a period of particular fertility in the independent music scene and released nearly thirty albums of original works over the next decade. Sch√ºtze contributed writings to The Wire, and performed his music in Europe, Scandinavia and Japan often with regular collaborator Simon Hopkins. In 1996 he formed improvising super-group Phantom City with Bill Laswell, Raoul Bj√∂rkenheim, Dirk Wachtelaer at its core and Alex Buess, Toshinori Kondo, Lol Coxhill and Jah Wobble as guest collaborators. In 2000 Sch√ºtze was invited to exhibit in Sonic Boom at the Hayward Gallery London by curator David Toop. The same year he received a large commission for a permanent installation work for Cap Gemini and a second for a massive twenty-two screen audio-video work at the Gasometer in Oberhausen, Germany. He also contributed a sound work to James Turrell's Eclipse event/publication in Cornwall. In 2002 Sch√ºtze began working with Alan Cristea Gallery London. In 2003 his first solo show Vertical Memory opened at ACG. The show included prints, video, sound and a huge wall work in which the whole of Alain Robbe-Grillet's novel Topology of A Phantom City was rendered as a continuous plane of silver text. In 2004, Stiftelsen 314 in Bergen, Norway mounted his solo show Garden of Instruments. This was the next stage in a large-scale project that began in 1997 with the release of Schutze's spoken architectural opera Second Site and continued with a series of lightboxes for ACG also in 2004. This project, which is still ongoing, now has its own site. In 2006 Sch√ºtze began to work with Galleria Estiarte in Madrid showing prints, videos and lightboxes. His work is also shown at the Alan Cristea Gallery in London. Following Sch√ºtze's two residencies at Cit√© des Arts in Paris making photographs, a solo show of photography ‚Äì Twilight Science ‚Äì opened in London at Alan Cristea Gallery in May 2008. An ongoing commission (initiated in 1999) to make a sound work for James Turrell's Roden Crater has involved several research trips and has now been completed as a five-hour installation piece in Dolby Surround. In 2011 Sch√ºtze launched dressingtheair.com, an open access online platform for multisensory creativity.

While cooling, the magma evolves in composition because different minerals crystallize from the melt. 1: olivine crystallizes; 2: olivine and pyroxene crystallize; 3: pyroxene and plagioclase crystallize; 4: plagioclase crystallizes. At the bottom of the magma reservoir, a cumulate rock forms. Fractional crystallization, or crystal fractionation, is one of the most important geochemical and physical processes operating within crust and mantle of a rocky planetary body, such as the Earth. It is important in the formation of igneous rocks because it is one of the main processes of magmatic differentiation.Petrology The Study of Igneous...Rocks, Loren A. Raymond, 1995, McGraw-Hill, p. 91 Fractional crystallization is also important in the formation of sedimentary evaporite rocks. Igneous rocks Fractional crystallization is the removal and segregation from a melt of mineral precipitates; except in special cases, removal of the crystals changes the composition of the magma. In essence, fractional crystallization is the removal of early formed crystals from an originally homogeneous magma (for example, by gravity settling) so that these crystals are prevented from further reaction with the residual melt. The composition of the remaining melt becomes relatively depleted in some components and enriched in others, resulting in the precipitation of a sequence of different minerals.Petrology The Study of Igneous...Rocks, Loren A. Raymond, 1995, McGraw-Hill, p. 65 Fractional crystallization in silicate melts (magmas) is complex compared to crystallization in chemical systems at constant pressure and composition, because changes in pressure and composition can have dramatic effects on magma evolution. Addition and loss of water, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and oxygen are among the compositional changes that must be considered. For example, the partial pressure (fugacity) of water in silicate melts can be of prime importance, as in near-solidus crystallization of magmas of granite composition. The crystallization sequence of oxide minerals such as magnetite and ulvospinel is sensitive to the oxygen fugacity of melts, and separation of the oxide phases can be an important control of silica concentration in the evolving magma, and may be important in andesite genesis. Experiments have provided many examples of the complexities that control which mineral is crystallized first as the melt cools down past the liquidus. One example concerns crystallization of melts that form mafic and ultramafic rocks. MgO and SiO2 concentrations in melts are among the variables that determine whether forsterite olivine or enstatite pyroxene is precipitated, but the water content and pressure are also important. In some compositions, at high pressures without water crystallization of enstatite is favored, but in the presence of water at high pressures, olivine is favored. Granitic magmas provide additional examples of how melts of generally similar composition and temperature, but at different pressure, may crystallize different minerals. Pressure determines the maximum water content of a magma of granite composition. High-temperature fractional crystallization of relatively water- poor granite magmas may produce single-alkali-feldspar granite, and lower- temperature crystallization of relatively water-rich magma may produce two- feldspar granite. During the process of fractional crystallization, melts become enriched in incompatible elements. Hence, knowledge of the crystallization sequence is critical in understanding how melt compositions evolve. Textures of rocks provide insights, as documented in the early 1900s by Bowen's reaction series. An example of such texture, related to fractioned crystallization, is intergranular (also known as intercumulus) textures that develop wherever a mineral crystallizes later than the surrounding matrix, hence filling the left-over interstitial space. Various oxides of chromium, iron and titanium show such textures, such as intergranular chromite in a siliceous matrix. Experimentally-determined phase diagrams for simple mixtures provide insights into general principles. Numerical calculations with special software have become increasingly able to simulate natural processes accurately.

In 1205, he went to Rome, where he was employed at the papal court as an expert in law. In 1237, he returned to Germany, and through his efforts a league was formed against Frederick II between Otto of Bavaria, Wenceslaus of Bohemia, and Frederick of Austria. When excommunication was pronounced against the emperor in 1239, Behaim was made a permanent delegate and commissioned to make the sentence effective. For that purpose he appealed to the bishops of Germany (1240), and when they proved themselves negligent he excommunicated a number of ecclesiastics and laymen of prominence. At the same time, he worked for the election of a new king. However, his excessive severity had no effect, and he was forced to leave the country. In 1245, he was at the Council of Lyon, where Frederick was again excommunicated, and he worked as before against the emperor. His office of papal delegate came to an end in 1253. From that time he lived in Passau, where he had been dean of the chapter since 1246. He laboured with zeal, but not without many conflicts, until his death. Works He left two diaries, known as the first and second Missivbuch.

Introduced by William J. Bell, the character made her debut during the episode airing on January 25, 1983, portrayed by Tracey E. Bregman. In 1992, Bregman brought the character to The Bold and the Beautiful, resulting in her migrating there fully in 1995. In 2000, Bregman returned to The Young and the Restless, remaining on a recurring status. The character was first married to private investigator Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) for two years. Much of Lauren's history on both soap operas revolves around her rivalry with villain Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown). They first fought over Scott Grainger (Peter Barton) in the early 1990s, with a love triangle forming around the three characters. The character was married to Scott twice and shares a son with him, Scotty (Blair Redford). Lauren has had numerous other storylines with Sheila throughout the years. In 2007, the character killed a woman claiming to be Sheila in self-defense. Lauren also has a long-running romantic history with Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), whom she married in 2005. They share a son together, Fenmore Baldwin (Max Ehrich). In 2010, Bregman portrayed dual roles as Lauren and Sheila's previously unheard of sister, Sarah Smythe, who was also killed by Lauren in self-defense. In 2013, after twelve years on a recurring status, Bregman was placed back on contract with the series. The actress has been positively received for her portrayal, which has garnered numerous Daytime Emmy Award and Soap Opera Digest Award nominations. Casting Bregman initially believed her role as Lauren would be brief, but after six months the soap offered her a contract and she accepted. On September 29, 1992, Bregman crossed over to The Bold and the Beautiful. She departed on October 2, 1992. Bergman began making recurring appearances on the show on March 25, 1993 till April 5, 1993, April 29, 1993 to May 10, 1993, November 2 to 16, 1993, January 12, 1994, March 6 to 21, 1995, May 29 until June 7, 1995. Three years later, the actress left the role on The Young and the Restless on October 13, 1995, migrating to its sister soap full-time on October 17, 1995 until August 16, 1999. Bregman would later make a few guest appearances on B&B; on July 5, 2002, May 17 to 20, 2004 and January 22, 2007. After a return guest appearance on Y&R; on June 15 to 26, 2000 and November 10 to 24, 2000, Bregman returned on a recurring status on August 24, 2001. In March 2013, it was announced that after twelve years on recurring, Bregman had been placed back on contract with the series. She was downgraded back to recurring status in May 2016. Actress Caryn Richman briefly played Lauren during Bregman's maternity leave. In 1985, Bregman became the first actress to be honored with the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series; when it was then titled \\"Outstanding Ingenue in a Drama Series.\\" She was nominated for Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2006 and 2008. Character development Lauren's first love interest on The Young and the Restless was Paul Williams (Doug Davidson). Davidson describes the relationship as Paul's \\"first non-drama fling\\", and stated that William J. Bell made the decision to pair the characters together spontaneously in the \\"spur of the moment\\", wanting to see the outcome. The actor enjoys the dynamics between the characters of Lauren and Paul, stating: \\"I always am excited whenever I get to work with her. We‚Äôve played friends, husband and wife, enemies, you name it. She is a dynamic actress and a wonderful friend and person.\\" The couple faced various challenges, including constant disapproval from Paul's mother Mary Williams (Carolyn Conwell), and Lauren's crazed stalker, Shawn Garrett (Grant Cramer). Lauren and Paul divorced, with Lynda Hirsch of the Sun Sentinel noting: \\"The marriage didn't work out, since Lauren desperately wanted a career in music and Paul wanted her to be a stay-at-home wife and eventually a mom.\\" Among other marriages, Lauren is recognized for her long-running marriage to Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc). Michael and Lauren have been described as one of the show's \\"most enduring couples\\". LeBlanc said \\"If it weren't for Lauren, Michael would have been off the deep end long before this.\\" He further told TV Guide about the pairing, \\"What's great about Lauren and Michael is that these are people who are not saints, who were adults when they met and have pasts they are not proud of. And they found each other.\\" The character is known for her longtime rivalry with Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown). On the topic of Lauren and Sheila's \\"cat fights\\", Brown said: \\"People like cat fights because we can get away with what you can't get away with in everyday life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [boy] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting and by the end of the day, you're spent.\\" Lauren is also known for having been kidnapped on several occasions. In 2010, she was involved in a doppelg√§nger storyline. A woman claiming to be Sheila's sister, Sarah Smythe, had plastic surgery to look like Lauren; she wanted revenge on Lauren for killing Sheila. Of the storyline, Bregman said, \\"Sarah really wants Lauren to suffer because Sarah has suffered so much. In Sarah‚Äôs mind, Sheila was murdered in cold blood by Lauren. Also, Sarah had to raise Sheila‚Äôs children because Sheila was always so obsessed with Lauren that she wasn‚Äôt around to raise her kids properly.\\" In 2012, Lauren and Michael's son Fenmore (Max Ehrich) began acting out, and developed a \\"bad side\\". Bregman explained that Lauren and Michael had \\"no role models\\" because, \\"Lauren‚Äôs father died early on, and she had a horrible mother\\", which could be the reasoning behind Fen's behavior. Storylines Lauren Fenmore is raised by her father Neil Fenmore (Jim Storm) due to her parents' divorce. Lauren rebels during her teen years, singing with Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian) and Traci Abbott (Beth Maitland), who became her rival for many years to come. Lauren spends years bullying and scheming against an insecure Traci. As she matures, Lauren falls in love with and marries private investigator Paul Williams (Doug Davidson), to the dismay of his interfering mother Mary (Carolyn Conwell). A stalker named Shawn Garrett (Grant Cramer) targets Lauren and forcing her to leave Paul by threatening to kill Paul if she didn't. Lauren discovers she is pregnant and is buried alive by Shawn (after he overhears her true feelings for him), though eventually saved by Paul, having lost the child. Paul leaves Lauren for good after she sells a nude photograph of him to a magazine. Neil dies and leaves Lauren as the owner of the Fenmore Department store chain. Lauren falls in love with and later marries Dr. Scott Grainger (Peter Barton). However, a mentally unstable nurse named Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) plots to steal Scott away from Lauren. Sheila drugs Scott and sleeps with him, allowing herself to become pregnant; Scott leaves Lauren to be with Sheila for the sake of the child. During this time, Lauren finds out that she is also pregnant, while Sheila loses her child. Sheila then fakes a pregnancy and purchases a baby on the black market and switches it with Lauren's baby boy when he is born. Lauren is left to believe her child died, though Sheila's mother Molly (Marilyn Alex) tells her the truth. Sheila kidnaps both Lauren and Molly and sets fire to the cabin they are in; Lauren and Molly make it out alive though Sheila is presumed dead. Lauren later learns that Sheila is alive in Los Angeles and engaged to Eric Forrester (John McCook). Scotty dies and makes Lauren promise to make peace with Sheila, who he believes has changed. When Sheila later attempts to drown Lauren in a hot tub, however, Lauren informs Dr. James Warwick (Ian Buchanan) of Sheila's destructive past. Lauren helps the Forresters get Sheila committed after Sheila holds them all hostage. During her stay in Los Angeles, Lauren engages in a brief romance with Eric, to the chagrin of his wife and Lauren's former friend Stephanie Douglas Forrester (Susan Flannery). They eventually break up. After crossing forth between Los Angeles and Genoa City, Lauren returns to Genoa City for a permanent stay in 2001, when she begins a partnership with Jabot Cosmetics. Lauren then reunites with Paul; the relationship recurs due to Paul's unstable former lover Isabella Bra√±a's (Eva Longoria) pregnancy, as well as his romance with another ex-wife, Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell). Lauren is stalked by a teenager named Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), who developed an obsession with her. After learning that Lauren accepted his prom invitation only to try to make him confess the crimes he committed, Kevin holds Lauren captive. During the abduction, Kevin tries to commit suicide, though his elder half-brother Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) talks him out of it and rescues Lauren. This period saw Lauren and Michael grow unexpectedly closer, and they begin a relationship which soon progresses into an engagement. Lauren's now grown up son Scott (Blair Redford) returns to Genoa City. It is revealed that Sheila had broken out of prison and had another female undergo plastic surgery to take her place; Lauren believes this is Sheila and resumes her normal life after an anxious period. Sheila has been living near Scott, who she grew close to. Sheila then returns to Genoa City and torments Lauren, involving Kevin's father Tom Fisher (Roscoe Born) in her next scheme. After Michael and Lauren's wedding, they retreat to a honeymoon on a yacht. Tom and Sheila show up, and blow up the yacht, allowing everyone to believe Lauren is dead. In reality, Tom had abducted both Sheila and Lauren. Lauren is eventually saved by Paul, though Sheila once again disappears. Lauren and Michael become pregnant, though stress over Sheila wanting to steal her child leads Lauren to suffer anxiety during her pregnancy. She gives birth to a premature son, Fenmore Baldwin (Max Ehrich). Paul locates a woman claiming to be Sheila in Genoa City; she underwent plastic surgery to look like Lauren's best friend Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford). Paul holds Sheila captive in a cage she created herself to entrap Fenmore. Sheila manages to escape and kidnaps Phyllis, her daughter Summer Newman (Hunter King) and Fenmore. Lauren frantically worries and eventually tracks down Sheila, Phyllis, Summer and Fenmore. Lauren shoots Sheila and resumes her peaceful life with Michael and Fenmore. In the following years Lauren helps Michael deal with his father River Baldwin (Michael Gross) and sister Eden Gerick (Vanessa Marano), who return to Genoa City. Lauren begins acting erratically, even sharing a kiss with Paul at a bar. Soon, she is abducted by Sheila's previously unheard of sister Sarah Smythe (Bregman), who is aided by Sheila's long lost twin children, Ryder Callahan and Daisy Carter. Sarah then poses as Lauren, as revenge for killing Sheila. Michael rescues Lauren and Kevin's wife Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien), who Sarah was also holding captive. Lauren shoots and kills Sarah. Lauren's life is complicated when she learns that Jill Foster Abbott (Jess Walton) is Neil's daughter, therefore her half-sister. Lauren's estranged mother confirms that Neil was aware of an illegitimate child, and Jill is granted ownership of Fenmore's Department stores. Despite an initial bitter rivalry, Lauren and Jill soon develop a relationship. Lauren continues to strive in her business career, earning a seat on Victor Newman's (Eric Braeden) board of directors at Newman Enterprises. Fenmore soon develops into a rebellious teenager, much like Michael and Lauren were during their upbringing, and develops an obsession with a now also teenage Summer. Summer and Fenmore bully a troubled fellow student, Jamie Vernon. Jamie and Fenmore have a fight on a rooftop, and Jamie falls onto a roof below. Jamie lies and tells the police that Fen pushed him, which is false. District attorney Michael is now forced to arrest Fenmore, weakening Michael and Lauren's marriage. Michael moves out and Lauren has an affair with the manipulative Carmine Basco (Marco Dapper), who develops an obsession with his love for Lauren. The affair is revealed, further straining the marriage. With much work, Lauren and Michael are able to get back together. However, they are soon forced to deal with an unstable Carmine who is consumed by Lauren, posting a video of their sexual encounter online and even kidnapping Lauren briefly.

It fractionates via differences in crystallization (forming of crystals). If a mixture of two or more substances in solution are allowed to crystallize, for example by allowing the temperature of the solution to decrease or increase, the precipitate will contain more of the least soluble substance. The proportion of components in the precipitate will depend on their solubility products. If the solubility products are very similar, a cascade process will be needed to effectuate a complete separation. This technique is often used in chemical engineering to obtain very pure substances, or to recover saleable products from waste solutions. Fractional crystallization can be used to separate solid-solid mixtures. An example is separating KNO3 and KClO3.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"weka stream\\" for Mangaweka. The township is interesting not only for the visually interesting historic main street, but also because of its growing artists' community. The main street is preserved in its original state due to SH1 being re-located in the early 1980s. This tore the heart out of the township as the main street became redundant, but this is what makes the township such a tourist attraction today, with many people stopping to take photographs and visit the flourishing art galleries. The main feature in Mangaweka is an elevated DC-3 aircraft. It was originally set above SH1 as a cafe, but this is currently closed and is awaiting redevelopment. The Department of Conservation have several scenic reserve walks around Mangaweka including one on the former North Island Main Trunk railway line and tunnels, replaced by a deviation in 1981. Famous (or infamous) people who have lived in Mangaweka include the New Zealand poet Sam Hunt, the artist Robin White (whose iconic \\"Mangaweka\\" painting hangs in Te Papa) and photographer/artist Richard Aslett.

The front of the main building of the Royal Hospital School. Herbert Tudor Buckland (20 November 1869 ‚Äì 1951) was a British architect, best known for his seminal Arts and Crafts houses (several of which, including his own at Edgbaston, Birmingham, are Grade I listed), the Elan Valley model village, educational buildings such as the campus of the Royal Hospital School in Suffolk and St Hugh's College in Oxford. Biography Buckland was born in Barmouth, Wales and educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham and the school of architecture at Birmingham School of Art. After a period working for C. E. Bateman at the firm Bateman and Bateman Buckland set up in independent practice in 1897, entering into partnership with Edward Haywood-Farmer in 1900. In 1914, he went into partnership with William Haywood, Edward Haywood-Farmer's relative and on Haywood-Farmer's death in 1917 the practice continued with William Haywood as Buckland and Haywood. Buckland followed William Martin as architect to the School Board in 1901Birmingham Buildings, The Architectural Story of a Midland City, Bryan Little, 1971, and then served as architect to the City of Birmingham Education Committee after the abolition of school boards in 1902: his buildings are amongst Birmingham's most forward-looking of their time. He also sat on the Executive Council of The Birmingham Civic Society which devised many schemes for the improvement of Birmingham in the 1920s and 1930s including the purchase of many parks and open spaces which were gifted to the city. Much of modern Birmingham owes its origins to the ideas put forward by Buckland and Haywood over 75 years ago. The partnership of Buckland-Farmer operated from offices in Norwich Union Chambers, Corngreve Street (now demolished). Buckland & Haywood specialised in school work, and St Hugh's College, Oxford (1914‚Äì16) gained them a national reputation. Their largest work in this field is the Royal Hospital School, Holbrook, Suffolk (1925‚Äì33), which includes a splendid chapel. In his domestic work Buckland showed an originality that was much admired, helping make Birmingham the centre for a magnificent group of provincial architects (a rare thing in Britain, where the Capital is one of the most metropolitan) at a time when London architects were some of the world's best. Alan Crawford, distinguished authority on the Arts and Crafts period, confirms that Buckland \\"developed such a highly personal style of such quality in domestic work that he must rank with the best of his time\\" ‚Äì Edwin Lutyens, Charles Voysey and Baillie Scott. Buckland's designs were much copied by his contemporaries and comparisons with Voysey are interesting. Major built works * Yateley Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, has a number of fine Arts and Crafts houses, of which No. 21, designed as his own home in (1899), is among the most stylish, with its preserved Arts and Crafts period interior and garden based on a design by Gertrude Jekyll. Listed Grade I. Also 15, 17 and 19 ‚Äì Grade II. * Royal Hospital School, Holbrook, Suffolk (1933): as spaciously planned a major building as any in the neo-Wren, neo- Georgian style, its scale and formality undeniably impressive. Listed Grade II Elan Valley Village (c.1909): an entire Model village built to service the work force of the newly constructed Elan Valley Dam. * St Hugh's College, Oxford * University House, Birmingham University: built in 1908, with Neville Chamberlain as the chief fund raiser. It was the first university hostel for women, and the first to admit male guests. Listed Grade II * Walkers Factory, Digbeth. Industrial architecture is not normally associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, but Birmingham has some excellent examples: Bucklands factory for the Walkers family at 58 Oxford Street being one. * Great Roke, Witley by Buckland and Haywood-Farmer, built in 1909, with plaster work by Catterson- Smith Jr.(now Barrow Hills School). This house was the biggest, most ambitious house undertaken by the partners and is arguably one of the finest large houses produced by the Birmingham Movement. Alan Crawford describes it as \\"surely one of the last of the important essays in the Arts and Crafts manner\\".

Bartlett said of the productions that: > I wanted to be as faithful to the stories and spirit of the Tales as > possible and we have tried to achieve that. ...

It is widely regarded as being one of Australia's top law schools. In 2020, QS World University Rankings ranked the UNSW Law Faculty 14th the best in the world, and 3rd in Australia. It is ranked second in Australia according to the ARWU 2017 subject rankings and the 2020 Times Higher Education subject rankings. The Faculty comprises the School of Law and 13 affiliated research and specialist legal centres, including a community legal centre, the Kingsford Legal Centre. The Faculty is also co- founder and operator of the Australasian Legal Information Institute (AustLII), which provides free access to case law, legislation and other primary legal resources online. It offers legal education for all career stages: undergraduate law dual degree programs, the Juris Doctor for graduates, postgraduate coursework, postgraduate research, and continuing legal education short courses. History The UNSW Law Building On 13 July 1964, the University's Council approved the creation of the UNSW Faculty of Law. On 24 January 1966, the Foundation Chair of Law was created, with the appointee to also be the Dean of the Faculty of Law. On 8 September 1969, Wootten was appointed to this position, where, in 1971, he would oversee the first teaching classes in the faculty. The Faculty opened on 1 March 1971 with 219 undergraduate students. Prior to this, only the University of Sydney offered law degrees in New South Wales. The task of establishing the new law school was given to John Halden Wootten QC, a former judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, who was appointed Foundation Dean in 1969. In 1976, the Faculty moved to occupy five floors of the UNSW Library Tower on upper campus. In 2006, the Faculty moved to a new law building on lower campus. The official opening took place on 21 September 2006 by the then Chief Justice of Australia Murray Gleeson. A quotation from Hal Wootten, Founding Dean, is set out on a wall of the law building: \\"a law school should have and communicate to its students a concern for those on whom the law may bear harshly.\\" Currently the Faculty teaches approximately 2,675 students. Reputation = Standing and rankings = In 2020, the QS World University Rankings placed UNSW Law School 14th on its list of the best law schools in the world, and in 2016 it was ranked 13th in the world. The law school is ranked second in Australia after the University of Melbourne by the ARWU 2017 subject rankings, and second in Australia by the 2020 Times Higher Education subject rankings. The UNSW Law School was noted as one of the primary faculties in helping to place the University 1st in Australia and 33rd in the globe for most millionaires produced. In the 2011, 2012 and 2013 Good Universities Guide, UNSW was the only law school in Australia to receive top ratings across all criteria, which include: teaching quality, generic skills, overall satisfaction, and success in obtaining a job. From 2006 to 2009, the Federal Government's assessment of excellence in tertiary education found that the Faculty lead all Australian universities for the quality of learning and teaching in law.2007 Learning and Teaching Performance Fund announcement by Federal Minister for Education, 7 December 20062008 Learning and Teaching Performance Fund announcement by Federal Minister for Education, 3 October 20072009 Learning and Teaching Performance Fund announcement by the Federal Minister for Education, 5 February 2009. Beginning in 2019, UNSW moved to trimesters seeing the teaching year divided into three terms rather than two semesters as previously. This led to a cut in contact hours with students, which was criticised as a cost saving measure. Other issues including limited time between terms, overall reductions in holidays and increased stress from higher workloads were outlined before the change to the three term system. At least some of those concerns materialised in 2019, for example contact hours (face to face teaching time) were reduced by 25% from 48 to 36 hours per course (on average) with no savings from this reduction being passed onto the student body Among the Go8 law schools, UNSW Law topped the Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching (QILT) 2014 survey, conducted and funded by the Australian Government Department of Education and Training, which measured the perspectives of recent students and graduates on experience as students and employment and salary outcomes. UNSW Law achieved the highest percentage in each of these categories, and continued to do so as of 2016. = Student achievements = In the past three years, five UNSW law graduates have won Rhodes scholarships. In 2018, three UNSW law graduates won New Colombo Plan Scholarships. UNSW law students have achieved success in a number of international advocacy competitions, including: *World Champion (2003, 2007, 2013), World Runner-Up (2005, 2016), and the Best Speaker in the English speaking rounds (2010, 2013) in the Jean-Pictet International Humanitarian Law Competition. *World Runner-Up (2008) and World Quarter-Finalists (2013) in the Philip C.

The academic study load of the JD program differs from that of undergraduate dual law program in that for a full-time study mode it requires a full study load of four law subjects each semester in contrast to only part law study load each semester in the undergraduate dual law program. Electives for the JD program are selected from postgraduate subjects such as those within but not limited to Master of Laws (LL.M). Core subjects in the program are taught solely within the JD cohort, with postgraduate electives taught with the postgraduate cohort and standard electives (if chosen) taught with the undergraduate dual law cohort. The UNSW JD program has previously been criticised for over-enrollment, with reports that a few students attempted to 'buy' their way into classes for as much as $10k. = Class format = The Law Faculty does not use a lecture and tutorial system common in faculties in England and still used by some other Australian law schools. Rather, the Faculty has long conducted classes in a seminar-format. Students are asked to contribute to class discussion using the Socratic method; basic learning is done through reading materials prior to class, and class time is devoted to examining the complexities and critical exploration of the material, though the level of Socratic questioning varies between teachers and courses. First year classes ordinarily have a maximum of 28 students. Most upper-year classes have a maximum of 44 students. Some upper-year courses have up to 90 students. = Overseas exchange programs = The Law Faculty offers a number law subjects taught at overseas institutions through international arrangements, including courses at Columbia Law School, UC Berkeley School of Law, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. It also offers exchange programs at over 60 universities, including Sciences Po, Panth√©on-Assas University, University College London, Tilburg University, McGill University, National University of Singapore, University of Hong Kong, Tsinghua University, Peking University, and others. Admissions  In 2015 and 2016, entry to the undergraduate combined law program required an ATAR mark of 99.7, the highest entry requirement for admission to a law degree in Australia. From 2017, entry into the undergraduate combined law program will be based on both an ATAR or academic result, as well as the results from a Law Admission Test (LAT) (not to be confused with the Law School Admission Test used in the United States). The test will consist of two questions requiring written responses. It is designed to assess aptitudes and skills that are relevant to success in the law program, including critical thinking and analysis, and organising and expressing ideas in a clear and fluent way. Applicants will have two hours to complete the test. The first LAT test will be held on Monday 26 September 2016 for entry into 2017 admission. LAT results will be valid for two years. The UNSW JD (Juris Doctor/J.D.) is the professional law degree for graduates of disciplines other than law, or with a law degree from an overseas institution. It is the equivalent of the undergraduate Bachelor of Laws for the purpose of admission as a legal practitioner, but is only open to university graduates. Entry into the JD program is based on academic results in previous university degrees earned by the applicant. The JD is also open to international applicants. Approximately 33% of cohort holds postgraduate qualifications.  Tuition fees  The undergraduate law program offers Commonwealth Supported Places (CSP). The Juris Doctor program offers both Commonwealth Supported Places (CSP) and Full-Fee places. Commonwealth Supported Places are offered to the most competitive domestic applicants and the remaining eligible domestic applicants will be offered a full-fee place in the JD program. As a guide, to be competitive for a CSP, applicants would have achieved at least a distinction average in previous Bachelor or master's degree. Applicant's eligibility to be offered a CSP place may be improved if they have also completed an optional honours year or research degree. The tuition fees for 2016 are as follows: * Commonwealth Supported Places (CSP): AU$10,440 per year at Commonwealth funded Maximum Student Contribution amount (per EFTSL) as per 2016 rates. * Full-Fee Places - Domestic: AU$38,640 per year (based on a full- time year of 48 units of credit) or $805 per unit of credit. * Full-Fee Places - International: AU$41,040 per year (based on a full-time year of 48 units of credit) or $855 per unit of credit. FEE-HELP is a Commonwealth government loan available to help eligible students pay part or all of their tuition fees. FEE-HELP is available only to domestic students on CSP or Full-Fee places. In 2016, the FEE-HELP limit is AU$99,389. Law centres within the faculty There is a number of UNSW Law Centres, which contribute to the Faculty's research as well as providing internships and clinical legal education to students. =Andrew & Renata Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law= The Andrew & Renata Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law was founded in October 2013 by former refugees Andrew and Renata Kaldor , who were awarded honorary doctorates by UNSW in November 2018. Dedicated to the study of international refugee law, it is a world-leading research centre. It undertakes research on displacement issues in Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and around the world, and contributes to public policy by proposing legal, sustainable and humane solutions to forced migration. In June 2019, the Centre published a document citing seven principles which should be key to Australia's refugee policy, supported by law and evidence-based research. =Australasian Legal Information Institute (AustLII)= The Australasian Legal Information Institute is operated jointly by the Faculties of Law at the UTS and the UNSW.

The Centre takes on cases where there is no other source of assistance or where acting for the client will benefit the community by achieving change in the law or government policy. The Centre advises on matters including domestic violence, debt, criminal law, employment law, legal aid, victim's compensation, motor vehicle accidents, consumer matters and accidents and injuries. It has a statewide specialisation in discrimination law.Joanna Mather, \\"Education Pro bono a bonus for law students\\", Australian Financial Review, 6 June 2011, p 28 via Media Monitors Australia Pty Ltd and factiva.com accessed 14 November 2011.Bernard Lane, \\"UNSW shows the law is an asset\\", The Australian (All-round Country edition), 12 November 2008, p 23, via factiva.com accessed 14 November 2011. =Others= , the following centres are also affiliated to the faculty: *The Allens Hub for Technology, Law & Innovation *Australian Human Rights Institute *Centre for Crime, Law & Justice *Centre for Law, Markets & Regulation (formerly Centre for International Finance and Regulation) *Herbert Smith Freehills China International Business and Economic Law (CIBEL) Centre *Indigenous Law Centre Other groups and centres There are a number of research groups attached to the Faculty of Law, including () * Environmental Law Group * IMF Bentham Class Actions Research Initiative * International Law & Policy Group * Legal Education Research Group * Network for Interdisciplinary Studies of Law * Private Law Policy & Research Group * Southeast Asia Law and Policy Forum * UNSW Law Initiative for Bio-legalities Affiliated centres: * Australian Pro Bono Centre * Diplomacy Training Program *Refugee Advice & Casework Service (RACS) *The Grata Fund *Youth Law Australia The Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre (formerly listed here) appears to be defunct.

Description and characteristics  The variation (\\"polymorphism\\", in this case, a \\"color morph\\") most commonly found is pure, dark, or light blue, although observers find the aqua, purple, or orange variation throughout the ocean. These sea stars may grow up to 30 cm (11.8 in) in diameter, with rounded tips at each of the arms; some individuals may bear lighter or darker spots along each of their arms. Individual specimens are typically firm in texture, possessing the slightly tubular, elongated arms common to most of other members of the family Ophidiasteridae, and usually possessing short, yellowish tube feet. An inhabitant of coral reefs and sea grass beds, this species is relatively common and is typically found in sparse density throughout its range. Blue stars live subtidally, or sometimes intertidally, on fine (sand) or hard substrata and move relatively slowly (mean locomotion rate of 8.1 cm/min). Image:Linckia laevigata Tonga.jpgIn Tonga Image:Aguirangan Blue Sea Stars.jpgIn Aguirangan Island, Philippines Image:Blue Star Fish (6244737028).jpgIn Bali Image:Linckia laevigata x2.jpgIn some places non-blue color morphs can be frequent, such as pink (here in Mayotte) Image:Reef4075 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg4-armed specimen The genus Linckia, as is true of other species of starfish, is recognized by scientists as being possessed of remarkable regenerative capabilities, and endowed with powers of defensive autotomy against predators: Although not yet documented, L. laevigata may be able to reproduce asexually, as does the related species Linckia multifora (another denizen of tropical seas, but of differing coloration, i.e., pink or reddish mottled with white and yellow, which has been observed reproducing asexually in captivity). Linckia multifora produces 'comets', or separated arms, from the mother individual; these offspring proceed to grow four tiny stubs of arms ready for growth to maturity. L. laevigata is apparently not an exception to this behavior, as many individuals observed in nature are missing arms or, on occasion, in the comet form. Some species of other reef inhabitants prey on this species of sea star. Various pufferfishes, Charonia species (triton shells), harlequin shrimp, and even some sea anemones have been observed to eat whole or parts of the sea stars. The Blue Linckia is also prone to parasitization by a species of the parasitic gastropod Thyca crystallina. Commensal associations sometimes play part on this echinoderm's life; animals such as Periclimenes shrimp are sometimes found commensally on the oral or aboral surface of the animal, picking up mucus and detritus. This sea star is fairly popular with marine aquarium hobbyists, where it requires a proper, slow acclimatization before entering the tank system, and an adequate food source similar to that found in its natural habitat. Generally thought of as a detritivore, many sources maintain that this species will indefinitely graze throughout the aquarium for organic films or sedentary, low-growing organisms such as sponges and algae. In the marine aquarium hobby, they have been seen to consume Asterina Starfish,http://www.reefcentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1745175&highlight;=blue+linckia which are commonly introduced into such aquaria on the ubiquitous \\"live rock\\" used in such settings. Depending on how abundant the food source is, as well as such factors as the conditions of shipping, acclimatization, and water quality, this species has been kept in captivity with variable success. This species has yet to be bred in captivity for sustainable harvest. This species has long been a staple of the sea-shell trade, which involves marketing dried sea star tests (skeletons) for curios or decoration. Some regions of their habitat have seen significant population decline due to the continuous harvesting by the sea-shell and tourism industries.

Komer graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Business School, later serving in World War II and joining the Central Intelligence Agency in its infancy in 1947. Career  Komer served on the staff of the National Security Council, which was led by McGeorge Bundy. After Bundy's departure, Komer briefly succeeded Bundy as interim National Security Advisor, before he was assigned to the Vietnam pacification campaign. While with the NSC, Komer and others negotiated with Israeli prime minister Levi Eshkol a memorandum of understanding (MOU) about Israeli nuclear capabilities.

Komer arrived in South Vietnam in May 1967 as the first head of the newly created Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support program, the most controversial aspect of which was the Phoenix program, which William Colby later testified resulted in 20,587 deaths. CORDS was an agency with a staff of both civilians and military personnel, but it fell under the authority of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam. President Lyndon Johnson had sent Komer to South Vietnam to provide impetus to the nation-building efforts of the new organization. Komer was known for his brusque management style, which had endeared him to the president and earned him the nickname \\"blowtorch Bob\\" from U.S. ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr..Jones 2005: 107 As head of CORDS, he commanded all pacification personnel in South Vietnam.Hunt 1995: 90. However, the problems CORDS faced were intractable and the results of Komer's work ambiguous. In a revealing discussion with military historians, Declassified in 2005. Komer said \\"everybody and nobody\\" was responsible for counter-insurgency against the communist Vietcong guerrillas. He said it \\"fell between stools which accounted for the prolonged failure to push things on a large scale even though many correctly analyzed the need\\". Komer focused his work on the expansion of village militias loyal to the South Vietnamese government, believing they could provide local security against guerrillas.Hunt 1995: 90 - 93 Komer left South Vietnam in 1968 upon being appointed ambassador to Turkey, and he was succeeded as head of CORDS by William E. Colby, who would later become head of the CIA. Komer also later worked as a consultant at the Rand Corporation and in the Jimmy Carter administration as the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.

Komer was visiting the campus at the invitation of university president Kemal Kurdas, who relied on American donors to finance the building of the modern campus. In the 1980s, Komer became a vocal critic of \\"The Maritime Strategy\\", which was devised by Secretary of the Navy John Lehman. Komer argued against spending the resources for 600 ships, part of a controversial plan to deter and contain the Soviet Union. Personal life Robert Komer married Jane and later divorced her.

It does not apply to more general legislation. Overview The word originated from the Roman imperial court, which often issued rescripts, in many cases prompted by its many governors and other officials. Some important early legal collections were composed entirely of rescripts, for instance the Codex Hermogenianus, published around AD 300.\\"Codex Hermogenianus\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, New York & Oxford, 1991, p. 474. The other main field of application is the papal Roman Curia, which adopted many Roman administrative terms and practices. Rescripts may take various forms, from a formal document of an established type, such as a Papal Bull, to the forwarding of the demand with a simple mention by way of decision, something like \\"rejected\\" or \\"awarded\\", either to the party concerned or to the competent executive office to be carried out. By analogy it is also applied to similar procedures in other contexts, such as the Ottoman, Chinese and Japanese imperial courts, or even prior to the Roman empire. Two well-known examples of Japanese Imperial rescripts were Emperor Hirohito's 1945 Imperial Rescript on the Termination of the War written in response to the Potsdam Declaration and his 1946 Humanity Declaration written in response to a request by General Douglas MacArthur. Papal rescripts Papal rescripts concern the granting of favours or the administration of justice under canon law. In Roman Catholicism rescripts are responses in writing by the pope or a Congregation of the Roman Curia to queries or petitions of individuals. French legal system In France, people have the possibility to ask an administration for a rescrit (rescript), which means that they will present to the competent administration a circumstanced particular case, and obtain a formal answer (the rescrit) by the administration explaining how the law will be applied to the submitted particular case. The rescript is binding for the administration, and may be used before a court of law to exonerate the person who asked for the rescript in case of prosecution. In English common law such a hypothetical process is not allowed, and cases must be determined on fact. U.S. legal system The Massachusetts appellate courts issue rescripts to the lower courts. These are the equivalent of mandates (i.e. writs of mandamus) in federal appellate practice.Mass. R.

Jalozai Refugee Camp  It was one of the largest of 150 refugee or transit camps in Pakistan, holding Afghan refugees from the 1980s Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It had an estimated 70,000 refugees at its peak. New Jalozai adjoined the original Jalozai camp in November 2000, taking in a new wave of arriving Afghan refugees. The camps briefly received an additional influx of refugees in the period after 9/11, leading up to the United States invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. After the fall of the Taliban, the vast majority of refugees in the Jalozai camp returned home or were relocated elsewhere. In February 2002, with a remaining population of 800, Jalozai camp was formally closed. But some problem elements remained through at least 2003, necessitating Pakistani military raids on the former camp that year. By 2012 Pakistan banned extensions to all foreign visas and continued its effort to close the remaining refugee camps. 1979 Soviet invasion After 1979, Peshawar served as a political centre for anti-Soviet Mujahideen, and became surrounded by huge camps of Afghan refugees. Many of the Afghan refugees fled through the historic Khyber Pass, near Peshawar. That major border city of a million people then replaced Kabul and Kandahar as the centre of ethnic Pashtuns (Pakhtuns) cultural development during the 1980s. Osama bin Laden was identified as a visitor to the Jalozai camp in the 1980s on one occasion. Bin Laden had been based around Peshawar since 1981, where he and Dr. Abdullah Yusuf Azzam were running a large contingent of foreign Arabs and material support involved in the Afghan resistance. Haji Dost Mohammad, the Jalozai security chief, and also a resident of Peshawar since 1979, recalled in a Reuters interview in 2001 that Osama bin Laden had visited Jalozai camp in 1987. According to Mr. Mohammad, \\"Once he came to the camp, 14 years ago, to deliver dates. He came only once. I haven't seen him since, and at the time I didn't know who he was.\\"Quote from Haji Dost Mohammad, who runs security at Jalozai, to Reuters in Peshawar on December 29, 2001. After the Soviet defeat in 1989, many of the Afghan refugees remained in Jalozai and in other Pakistan camps throughout the subsequent civil war and ensuing Afghan rule by the Taliban. =November 2000 New Jalozai= In October 2000, the USS Cole bombing by al-Qaeda brought many relief agencies to Pakistan, in anticipation of a new exodus of Afghan refugees. The expected retaliation from the United States government then came. Though it was limited to cruise missiles fired into al- Qaeda training camps in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan, the expected wave of new refugees also followed. The old Jalozai camp continued to contain thousands of refugees from the 1980s and 1990s conflicts. But in November 2000, the \\"New Jalozai\\" camp was also established, next to the existing old Jalozai camp. Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) began working in New Jalozai in November 2000. Since that time, an additional 50,000 refugees arrived in the Peshawar area, and had settled in the New Jalozai refugee camp through the nine months ending in July 2001.Afghan Refugees in Jalozai Camp (Peshwawar, Pakistan), a photo documentary/July 2001, Doctors Without Borders At the start of 2001, there were nearly 150 refugee camps in Pakistan with some 1.1 million Afghan residents in the camps. Just over 3 million Afghans lived in Pakistan overall, including the camps.UN consolidates Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan , One World South Asia By late 2001, the combined Jalozai refugee camps were estimated by Reuters to have been home to 300,000 Afghans, in total during various times over more than two decades. Most sources put the camp population at 70,000 refugees at its peak. But through July 2001, the combined Jalozai camp was still merely a makeshift transit point. It did not have formal UN status as a refugee camp. No registration had ever taken place in the camp, so substandard living conditions prevailed for the tens of thousands of refugees at Jalozai. In mid-2001, before the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, 10,000 of the Afghans in the Jalozai camp were recognized and registered as genuine refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and transferred to the new Shamshatoo refugee camp outside the city of Peshawar according to UNHCR spokesperson Melita Sunjic. =2002 camp closures and returnees= By early 2002, 50,000 had been relocated from Jalozai camp. Many of those had returned home to Afghanistan following the removal of the Taliban from power in late 2001. Most of the other former residents of the Jalozai camp had relocated to six new camps built in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since September 11, 2001, including Kotkai, Bajaur, Shalman, Old Bagzai, Basu and Ashgaru. On February 11, 2002 UNHCR said that the Jalozai refugee camp would be closed the next day, on February 12, 2002. The a statement of the United Nations refugee agency said that UNHCR deputy representative to Pakistan Eva Demant and commissioner for Afghan refugees would officially close the site.Pakistan's Jalozai Refugee Camp to Be Closed, People's Daily, (Beijing Time) Tuesday, February 12, 2002 As of February 11, 2002, the remaining some 800 refugees in Jalozai were scheduled to be transferred to Barkili close to the Afghan border on the following day. In March 2002, the UN refugee agency began a voluntary repatriation campaign in Pakistan. By the end of 2002, UNHCR had repatriated 1.53 million Afghan refugees from Pakistan, including 1.4 million from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 82% were from urban areas; only 3% were from new camps, which had been created in anticipation of the October 2001 US coalition invasion.Humanitarian Assistance for Afghan Refugees and IDPs , Center of Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance, April 22, 2005 UNHCR emphasis in 2003 was on repatriation from old camps and cities in Pakistan to rural areas in Afghanistan. 70% of returnees from Pakistan were from cities and 30% from camps. On March 9, 2003 Pakistani security forces carried out raids in Jalozai refugee camp near Peshawar. The forces also raided nearby Shamshatoo camp. No one was detained. 2004 returnees were 385,000 from Pakistan. 2005 UNHCR plans called for 400,000 Afghan refugees to return home from Pakistan. As of early April 2005, 11,000 Afghans returned home in early 2005. 7,000 returned from Pakistan since assisted returns resumed in March. Returns were climbing closer to 500 a day from 250 in March. Numbers were expected to swell as the weather warmed into the summer. UNHCR was then planning, with Pakistan, for perhaps 1.5 million refugees who would stay after termination of the tripartite refugee return agreement in March 2006. In 2005, with more Afghans drawn home by improving conditions, all the \\"new\\" camps in Pakistan established to shelter Afghans anticipated to be fleeing the 2001 war in Afghanistan had been closed. More than 580,000 Afghans had gone home from the camps since the UN's voluntary repatriation programme began in 2002. As of 2005, camp closures continued in parallel with the UNHCR repatriation operation that began in March 2002 and helped 2.4 million Afghan refugees from Pakistan to go home, the agency's largest such programme anywhere in the world. The region was rocked severely by the catastrophic 2005 Kashmir earthquake. In 2012 Pakistan continued its effort to close the remaining refugee camps in the country and banned extensions of all foreign visas, including Afghanistan, leading to a mass number of returnees.http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/02/17/news/national/no-more- visa-extensions-for-foreigners-in-pakistan/  Jalozai Special Economic Zone  In July 2020, KP Chief Minister Mehmood Khan officially launched the Jalozai Special Economic Zone in the Nowshera District.

The two most famous ones are the 'Oparara Arch', large enough for a multi-storey house, and the 'Moria Gate Arch', which is smaller in height. The arches can be reached by a forestry road from the main road approximately 9 km north of Karamea. The 12 km road is rough but can be accessed by normal cars most of the year. A carpark with a modern open shelter and toilet facilities just before the bridge over the Oparara River is the starting point for walks of around an hour return to each of the arches. There are also mountain bike tracks and a mountain lake in the area.Oparara Basin walking tracks (from the New Zealand Department of Conservation website. Accessed 2013-09-16.) Oparara Arch, with Oparara River below colored a reddish brown by natural tannins Oparara Arch Oparara Arch is the largest natural rock arch in the southern hemisphere.Information contained on a DoC information panel at the carpark picnic shelter An old sign at the end of the walking track inside the arch lists the measurements as 200m long, 49m wide, and 37m high.,Sign inside Oparara Arch however, the New Zealand Department of Conservation's measurements put it at 219m long, up to 79m wide, and 43m high. The southern entrance of Oparara Arch can be reached via a well-formed half an hour walking track which follows the Oparara River upstream. Shortly after the track crosses a bridge over a small tributary stream into Oparara River, it leads about one third of the way into the Oparara Arch, ascending up a series of wooden steps to end at a view point. The elevated view point is about two thirds up inside the height of the arch and takes in both entrances of the main arch as well as the Oparara River below. After rain, a small waterfall can be present in the center of the rock arch. The main tunnel is preceded (downstream) by an even taller, 10m long rock arch with a gap of about 10m to the main tunnel. Around the area of the view point, the start of the formation of stalactites and stalagmites can be seen. Oparara River flowing out of Moria Gate Arch Moria Gate Arch Moria Gate Arch is smaller than Oparara Arch and can be reached on a different track from the Oparara carpark. The 1.5 hour loop track takes in the Moria Gate Arch and the Moria Gate Mirror Tarn, whose names are inspired by The Lord of the Rings, like various other place names in the area. Moria Gate Arch is reached after half an hour of easy walking, however, the narrow entrance of the side track to go into the river cave descends down slippery rocks. A chain and railings to hold onto are provided for support. Once inside the rock arch, the ground is level and easy to walk on. It is not necessary to go into the cave; the loop track continues over the rock arch to a view point of the upstream entrance. A small section between the side track into the cave and the view point is paved with irregular pavers depicting Moa \\"footprints\\". Inside Moria Gate Arch; Oparara River flowing from left to right Moria Gate Arch is 19 m high and 43 m wide and its ceiling is extensively covered with stalactites and roots. The center portion of the river cave is spacious and its floor covered in sand accumulated by the Oparara River flowing through it, making it easy to explore the cave along the river's edge to both entrances. Honeycomb Hill Arch The HoneyComb Hill Arch is difficult to access and is located in the restricted area of the Kahurangi National Park. This area is accessible by permit only, as it contains several sites of globally significant fossils and finds of extinct birds. The rock arch can only be accessed by kayak.

The fifty-episode series first aired in Japan from 1992 until 1993. It has also been broadcast in Hong Kong, South Korea, Italy, Taiwan, China, France, Poland, Thailand, and in most Arab countries. The series was adapted as a theatrical film and two educational films. The DVD version was released on March 20, 2004. Overview Many other magical girls are primary-schoolers or middle-schoolers, but Mary Bell looks like a preschooler (although she is actually about 500,000 years old). She is a \\"native\\" magical girl just like Minky Momo and Sweet Mint, other magical girls by Ashi Productions from the same period. However, she is not a princess. The operatic approach is notable, each main character has his or her own leitmotif, and they sometimes sing instead of speaking, like a musical. Story Yuuri and Ken are two siblings living in the port town of Sunny Bell, where their parents have recently moved and set up a flower shop. They read a book, the Mary Bell Picture Book, borrowed from their neighbor Rose, which is a story about two children who get lost in the forest and are helped by a magical girl named Mary Bell. The children wish aloud that Mary Bell was there to help their parents' struggling flower shop. Suddenly, the titular character appears in front of them, introduces herself and her Seelie Court partner Tambourine, and agrees to help them with magic. Over the course of the series, Mary Bell, Ken, Yuuri, a dog named Ribbon, and a cast of supporting characters go on adventures in both Sunny Bell and the Flower Magic World, Mary Bell's home. The series finale involves the Holy Tree of the Flower Magic World coming to Sunny Bell in order to take away all of the plants on Earth, as it believes is necessary to prevent humans from harming them. Mary Bell and the townspeople are able to convince it not to do this, and Mary Bell decides to stay on Earth and encourage people with magic, even though her goal (to collect the dreams of humans by helping them) has already been completed. Main characters Mary Bell is the central character of the show, she helps children or others when they are trying to do something. A little girl, Yuuri, her younger brother, Ken, and Ribbon, a puppy, are the ones who first met Mary Bell. Other three children, Vivian, Bongo, and Tap, frequently appear too. ; : A \\"floral magician\\" from who looks like a little girl, but actually is about 500,000 years old. She uses both (ordinary) magic and flower magic. She is a fairies' friend, but is not a fairy herself. Her catchphrase is ; : Mary Bell's \\"magical companion.\\" He is from the seelie court, and also about 500,000 years old. ; : Mary Bell's friend. Her exact age is unknown, but apparently between six and ten. ; :Yuuri's little brother. About five years old. ; : A nice, old lady, who believes in fairies. She lives alone (with her dog, Ribbon) next door to the Mary Bell flower shop. She is the actual owner of the in-anime Mary Bell Picture Book. When Mary Bell first appeared, Yuuri and Ken were not ready to believe that she was the real Mary Bell, whereas Rose, when she met Mary Bell, immediately told her, \\"I always wanted to meet you, Mary Bell. I am a big fan of yours.\\" Children usually call her \\"Grandma Rose\\". ; :Rose's dog, often mistaken for a female due to the bow in his hair. ; :The mother of Yuuri and Ken. ; :The father of Yuuri and Ken, and the owner of the Mary Bell flower shop. ; : Another neighbor, living in the house next to Grandma Rose's. A crusty and stubborn old man, who doesn't like flowers, until the last three episodes (episodes 48, 49, and 50). ; : Bart's nephew, living in Bart's house. He looks about twenty years old. When he was a little child, he got lost and helped by fairies. His friends didn't believe him and called him a liar. Since then, he keeps trying to capture a fairy to prove that he told the truth. He is a \\"fairy hunter\\" and so Mary Bell's and fairies' enemy (at least at first). ; :Bart's granddaughter, living in his house. She is about the same age as Yuuri. She is realistic, and does not believe in fairies at all (at least at first). She is mean to Mary Bell (at least at first). ; : A friend of Vivian's. who has a crush on Yuuri. ; : A friend of Vivian's. ; : One of the local policemen. ; : Bra's partner. ; : A news reporter implied to be originally from North America who works at the local television station. ; : A local professor. ; : Mary Bell's father. In the human world, he is known as a genius magician. He is always calm and has a gentlemanly personality. His magical spells are \\"Paparin, Berlin, Lan Lan Run\\". ; : Mary Bell's mother. In the human world, she is named as a genius chef called \\"Fairy Sweet Maker\\", and Rose and Remi are also her fans. While she and her husband are traveling all over the world, they are inspiring dreams. Magical spells are \\"Mamarin, Berlin, Lunrunlun\\". Development Floral Magician Mary Bell is influenced by Mary Poppins or Mary Poppins (film), or both. The protagonists of Mary Bell Picture Book are Jane and Michael, the same names that appear in Mary Poppins. Anime The TV series was planned and produced by TV Setouchi, Big West, and Ashi Productions. It was directed by Tetsuya Endo, with series composition by Takao Koyama and Hideki Mitsui (both from Brother Noppo).

The book includes anecdotes about high-society figures who frequented brothels or were otherwise involved with prostitutes. Their names are partly blanked out, but were obviously recognisable, with a Miss Armstrong appearing as \\"Armstr_ng\\". Particular mention is given to the exploits of the Duke of Queensberry and the Earl of Sandwich. The second volume includes a defence of prostitution as social necessity: > \\"Even in the state of matrimony itself, it often happens, that a man who > holds his wife in the highest estimation, may be debarred the felicity of > hymeneal raptures, from sickness, absence, and a variety of other temporary > causes, which may with facility be imagined. If, in any of those situations, > a man could not find temporary relief in the arms of prostitution, the peace > of Society would be far more disturbed than it is: The brutal Ravisher would > stalk at large, and would plead, as in the case of hunger, that the violence > of his passion would break down even stone walls: No man's wife, sister, or > daughter would be in a state of security: The rape of the Sabines would be > daily rehearsed, and anarchy and confusion ensue. In this point of view > then, at least, female prostitution should be winked at, if not protected; > and though it may be pronounced a moral evil, it certainly is a political > good\\". In chapter 24 the writer provides a detailed description of life at Charlotte Hayes' seraglio (high-class brothel) at King's-Place, St James's (now Pall Mall Place off Pall Mall), and aspects of Hayes' life. Volume I states that Hayes' fortune was derived from the \\"follies, vices and profligacy of the age\\". There is an itemised price list from a typical day at the brothel, with entries including a client named Doctor Frettext, who would pay two guineas for the services of Poll Nimblewrist or Jenny Speedyhand. There is also an account of the recruitment techniques by which Charlotte Hayes tricked young women into joining the brothel.

The catchment drained by the glacier is estimated at , extending approximately into the interior and holds the potential to raise sea level by at least . Totten drains northeastward from the continental ice but turns northwestward at the coast where it terminates in a prominent tongue close east of Cape Waldron. It was first delineated from aerial photographs taken by USN Operation Highjump (1946‚Äì47), and named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for George M. Totten, midshipman on of the United States Exploring Expedition (1838‚Äì42), who assisted Lieutenant Charles Wilkes with correction of the survey data obtained by the expedition. Totten Ice Shelf is a floating portion of Totten Glacier, laterally bounded by the Aurora Subglacial Basin to the south and Law Dome to the north. The ice shelf exists at the confluence of the two main grounded tributaries of Totten Glacier, its base lies below sea level near the grounding line of the western tributary, and the ice shelf surface is characterized by longitudinal channels and transverse fractures. Totten Ice Shelf is of glaciological interest because it buttresses the flow of grounded ice while coupling the ice basin to ocean processes such as ocean warming. Totten Glacier Tongue () is a small glacier tongue extending seaward from Totten Glacier. Delineated from air photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump (1946‚Äì47) and named by US-ACAN in association with Totten Glacier. Melt Totten Glacier drains the Aurora Subglacial Basin, which is largely grounded below sea level and is subject to marine ice sheet instability, meaning melt near the grounding line could lead to runaway glacier retreat and a significant contribution to sea level rise. Surface altimetry measurements from Interferometric synthetic-aperture radar suggest that Totten Glacier lost mass from 1992 to 2006 and gravity measurements obtained by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite indicate mass loss has continued through at least 2016. The ICESat laser altimeter measured surface lowering of the grounded and floating portions of Totten Glacier from 2003 to 2009; however, longer term observations of the floating ice shelf show interannual variability of thickness and velocity. Totten Glacier loses mass primarily through melt at its ice shelf base, and melt is influenced by the availability of ocean heat entering the cavity below the ice shelf. Warm, modified Circumpolar deep water enters the Totten Ice Shelf cavity through submarine canyons, driven by wind processes at the nearby continental shelf break. Wind processes and sea ice formation along the Sabrina Coast have been linked to variability in Totten Ice Shelf basal melt and calving rates.

Location Sremƒçica is located south of Belgrade and begins some 2 km south of the southernmost part of the neighborhood of ≈Ωeleznik (though centers of these two settlements are 6-7 kilometers apart). It is a typical road settlement stretched along the central Beogradska street, with many side streets simply being named Beogradska street part 1, 2, etc., but most of them got their own, separate names in 2004‚Äì2007. The northern section of the neighborhood makes a separate local community (mesna zajednica), sub-municipal administrative unit, named Gorica but is popularly called Naselje (Serbian for \\"settlement\\") by the local population, which numbered 5,358 in 2002. Southern part is organized as a local community with the same name as the entire settlement, Sremƒçica. Bot local communities were later merged into one. Demographics According to the 2011 census results, Sremƒçica has 21,001 inhabitants. Predominantly a rural settlement, it is one of the fastest growing suburbs of Belgrade since the 1970s. However, its accelerated growth without any planned construction, is not followed by the equal growth of infrastructure, so most parts of Sremƒçica have some major communal problems (water, sewage, traffic). Despite having population of almost 21,000 inhabitants, only two bus lines (511 and 512) connects it to 20 km away Belgrade. Geography Terrain around the settlement is partially made of limestone (karstic micro-region, called Belgrade merokras). One of the best known features in Sremƒçica is a small pond, Rakina bara, meaning \\"Raka's pond\\". It is a small natural lake with an area of , formed in the limestone pit, the only karst lake on the territory of the city of Belgrade. It is embedded into the mass wasting area and, typically for the karst lakes, has a sinkhole. Turned into a fish pond and projected as the future recreational area, as the settlement grew, population from the neighboring slopes turned their sewage pipes into the pond which is today covered with reed, turned into a dump and without any fish at all as it almost dried out.

From the time that the abode and virtues of Paul of Thebes were revealed to Antony the Abbot, various communities of hermits adopted him as their patron saint. Male congregations Congregations divided according to gender. Male and female congregations each had distinct characteristics. =Order of Saint Paul, the first hermits= Hermits of Saint Paul of France  They are also called Brothers of Death. Controversy swirls around the origin of this congregation, but it was probably founded about 1620 by Guillaume Callier, whose constitutions for it were approved by Pope Paul V (18 December 1620) and later by king Louis XIII of France (May, 1621). The two classes of monasteries were those in the cities, obliged to maintain at least twelve members, who visited the poor, the sick, and prisoners, attended those condemned to death, and buried the dead; and those outside the city, which were separate cells in which solitaries lived. The community assembled weekly for choir and monthly to confess their sins. Severe fasts and disciplines were prescribed. The name Brothers of Death originated from the fact that the thought of death was constantly before the followers. At their profession the prayers for the dead were recited; their scapular bore the skull; their salutation was Memento mori 'remember you're to die'; the death's head was set before them at table and in their cells. This congregation was suppressed by Urban VIII in 1633. Hermits of Saint Paul of Portugal Among the conflicting accounts of the foundation of this congregation, the most credible is that it was established about 1420 by Mendo Gomez, a nobleman of Simbria, who resigned military laurels to retire in solitude near Set√∫bal, where he built an oratory and gave himself up to prayer and penance, gradually assuming the leadership of other nearby hermits. Later, a community of hermits of the Sierra de Ossa, left without a superior, prevailed on Mendo Gomez to unite the two communities under the patronage of Paul of Thebes, the first recognized hermit. At the chapter held after the death of the founder (24 January 1481), constitutions were drawn up, later approved, with alterations, by Gregory XIII in 1578, at the request of Cardinal Henry of Portugal, who obtained the privilege of adopting the Rule of St. Augustine. This congregation was later suppressed. Probably the most celebrated member was Antonius a Matre Dei, author of Apis Libani, a commentary on the Proverbs of Solomon. Hermits of Saint Paul of Poland Pauline monks in Poland. This monastic Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit was founded in 1215 in Hungary. The founder was Blessed Eusebius of Esztergom, who united the hermits of Hungary in monasteries under the patronage of Paul the Hermit. The Order spread throughout Hungary and then into Croatia, Germany, Poland, Austria and Bohemia. At one time, over 5000 Pauline monks lived in Hungary alone. A significant event in the Order's history took place in 1382 when it became the custodian of the miraculous picture of The Black Madonna, believed to be painted by Luke the Evangelist. Legend says the Icon was brought to Poland by Prince Ladislaus from a castle at Beiz, Russia. He invited the monks to come from Hungary into Poland. The monks established a Shrine for the venerable image of the Blessed Mother in the town of Czƒôstochowa. Today this Shrine is the Motherhouse of the Order, and is also the largest monastery, with over 100 monks of the order. Less than 500 members of the Order remain. Most of the Order's monasteries are located in Poland. Other monasteries and shrines survive in Germany, Slovakia, Croatia, Ukraine, Belarus, Hungary, Italy, United States of America and South Africa. Female congregations = Blind Sisters of Saint Paul = The Blind Sisters were founded in Paris in 1852, by Abel-Fran√ßois Villemain (d. 1870),Gino Todisco (1983), Note e ricerce su Abel-Fran√ßois Villemain, Cassino, Frosinone: S. Benedetto. Anne Bergunion (d. 1863), and Abb√© Jug√©. Its mission is to enable blind women to lead a religious life, and to facilitate the training of blind children in useful occupations. A home was established for blind women and girls with defective sight. = Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres = Cathedral at Chartres The Sisters were formerly known as \\"Daughters of the School.\\" In 1696, the congregation was founded by Fr. Louis Chauvet, parish priest of Levesville-la-Chenard, a village in the region of Beauce, some 60 miles southeast of Paris. Marie Anne de Tilly, a member of the first community of three Sisters, prepared her companions for their mission: to instruct the daughters of farm laborers, to teach poor village girls, to visit the poor and the sick and to serve in the hospitals in small communities of two or three sisters. As early as 1708, Father Chauvet entrusted the growing community of the School Sisters to Msgr. Paul Godet des Marais, Bishop of Chartres. Godet provided a house in the St. Maurice suburbs, an ecclesiastical superior in the person of Father Marechaux, and a name, that of the Apostle Paul who was to be their patron and model. From the time of its birth, one foundation followed another in rapid succession. One of their houses in Chartres formerly belonged to a sabot-maker, and this gave them the name of \\"Les Soeurs Sabotiers\\", by which they were originally known. There were no lay-sisters. Every sister must be prepared to undertake any kind of work. The postulancy lasts from six to nine months, the novitiate two years, after which the sisters take vows annually for five years, and then perpetual vows. The congregation was dispersed under the Commune at the French Revolution, but it was restored by Napoleon I. He gave the sisters a monastery at Chartres, which originally belonged to the Jacobins, from which they became known as \\"Les Soeurs de St. Jacques\\". After its revival the congregation numbered 1200 sisters and over 100 houses in England, Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Korea, China, Japan, Further India, the Philippines, etc. In China, a novitiate was established for native subjects; and in Hong Kong, a school for European children, along with various benevolent institutions. In the Philippines, schools, hospitals, pastoral centers including and a leper hospital, and a formation house for candidates wishing to belong to the Congregation. They settled in England in 1847 at the invitation of Nicholas Cardinal Wiseman. In 1907, they had fifty-six houses in various towns; their work in England was mainly educational, schools were attached to all their houses. Until 1902, they had over two hundred and fifty houses in France where, besides schools, they undertook asylums for the blind, the aged, and the insane, hospitals, dispensaries and cr√®ches. More than one hundred and sixty of these schools were later closed because of the laicist policy of the Waldeck-Rousseau government and succeeding governments in France, as were thirty of the hospitals, military and civil, in the French colonies, three convents at Blois and a hospice at Brie. They opened five or six hospitals in the French colonies, six hospitals and 39 schools in the Philippines, and three educational houses and Saint Louis Hospital in Thailand. Guided by the motto of the congregation, Caritas Christi Urget Nos (The Charity of Christ Urges Us), at present, some 4000 Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres work in 34 countries.http://www.stpaulrome.com/eng-generalate.html References Further reading Gino Todisco (1983), Note e ricerche su Abel-Fran√ßois Villemain, Cassino, Frosinone: S.

Poppaedius was called the 'heart and soul' of the rebellion.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 66 and p. 108; Smiths, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, p. 3158. He was a friend of Marcus Livius Drusus the Younger. A story told by Plutarch tells of Silo making a visit to his friend Marcus Livius and meeting the children of the house. In a playful mood he asked the children's support for his cause. All of them nodded and smiled except Cato the Younger, who stared at the guest with most suspicious looks. Silo demanded an answer from him and seeing no response took Cato and hung him by the feet out of the window. Even then, Cato would not say anything.Plutarch, Life of Cato the Younger, 2. In 91 BC, Poppaedius led 10,000 Marsi in a march on Rome to support Drusus' pro-Italian legislation.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 58. They were met by Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, the Pontifex Maximus, who persuaded them to go back.Lynda Telford, Sulla, p.85. After Drusus's murder, the Social War started and Silo became the military leader of the Marsi. At the start of the War, twelve Italian tribes formed Italia, their own state in Italy (as an alternative to the Roman Republic), and Silo was elected one of two Italian consuls. As 'consul' Silo was given command of the Marsic group (Marsi, Paeligni, Vestini, Marrucini, Picentes, Frentani), whereas his consular colleague Gaius Papius Mutilus was given command of the Samnite group. During the second year of the war (90 BC) he tricked and ambushed the Roman praetor Quintus Servilius Caepio and slaughtered his army.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 94-95; Appian, Civil Wars, 1.44. Poppaedius is said to have killed Caepio himself, as Poppaedius held Caepio responsible for the murder of his friend Drusus.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 89. He then went after Caepio's co-commander Gaius Marius, Rome's most experienced general, but was unable to force a decisive engagement.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 101-102. This led Poppaedius to challenge Marius: 'So if you are such a great general, Marius, why not come down [from your fortifications] and fight it out?' To this Marius retorted 'Well, if you think you are any good a general, why don't you try to make me?'Plutarch, Life of Marius, 33 During 89 BC the fortunes of war turned against the Italian rebels. Poppaedius, now fighting in Samnium, recaptured the Samnite capital Bovianum which had been taken by Lucius Cornelius Sulla.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 108. After Bovianum he tried to eject the Romans from Apulia but he was killed in battle by Drusus's brother, Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus.Thomas Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, vol II, p. 42; Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 108.

He controls Vedanta Resources through Volcan Investments, a holding vehicle with a 100% stake in the business. Early life Agarwal was born and brought up in Patna, India. His father Dwarka Prasad Agarwal had a small aluminium conductor business. He studied at Miller High School, Patna. and decided to join his father's business, making aluminium conductors, instead of going to university. At 19, he left Patna for Mumbai (then Bombay) to explore career opportunities. Career  In the mid-1970s, he began trading in scrap metal, collecting it from cable companies in other states and selling it in Mumbai. In 1976, Anil Agarwal acquired Shamsher Sterling Corporation, a manufacturer of enameled copper, among other products, with a bank loan. For the next 10 years, he ran both businesses. In 1986, he set up a factory to manufacture jelly-filled cables, creating Sterlite Industries. He soon realized that the profitability of his business was volatile, fluctuating with the prices of his raw materials: copper and aluminium. So he decided to control his input costs by manufacturing the metals instead of buying them. In 1993, Sterlite Industries became the first private sector company in India to set up a copper smelter and refinery. In 1995, Sterlite Industries acquired Madras Aluminium, a 'sick' company that had been shut down for 4 years and held by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). The next step of the backward integration process seemed natural: mining. His first opportunity came when the government announced a disinvestment program. In 2001, he acquired 51 percent in Bharat Aluminium Company (BALCO), a public sector undertaking; in the very next year, he acquired a majority stake (nearly 65 per cent) in state-run HZL(Hindustan Zinc Limited). Both the companies were considered sleepy and inefficient mining firms. To access international capital markets, Anil Agarwal and his team incorporated Vedanta Resources Plc in 2003 in London. At the time of its listing, Vedanta Resources Plc, was the first Indian firm to be listed on London Stock Exchange, on 10 December 2003, Vedanta Resources became the parent company of the group through a process of internal restructuring of group companies and their shareholding. In 2004 Vedanta Resources Plc announced a global bond offering and acquired Konkola Copper Mines in Zambia, Africa. In 2007, Vedanta Resources acquired a controlling stake in Sesa Goa Limited, India's largest producer-exporter of iron ore, and in 2010, the company acquired South African miner Anglo American's portfolio of zinc assets in Namibia, Ireland and South Africa. The next year, Vedanta Resources acquired controlling stake in Cairn India, India's largest private sector oil-producing firm. The merger of Sesa Goa and Sterlite Industries was announced in 2012, as part of the Vedanta Group's consolidation. Vedanta Resources, headquartered in London, is a globally diversified natural resources conglomerate, with interests in zinc, lead, silver, copper, iron ore, aluminium, power generation, and oil and gas. The greatest share of its assets, however, is in India; Agarwal lives in London. In October 2017, it was announced that Agrawal's Volcan Holdings Plc had taken a 19% stake in mining company Anglo American, making him biggest shareholder of the company. According to The Sunday Times Rich List in 2020 his net worth was estimated at ¬£8.5 billion.  Controversy and criticism In 2004, a committee of the Indian Supreme Court charged that Vedanta had dumped thousands of tons of arsenic-bearing slag near its factory in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, resulting in major poisoning of the environment and neighbouring population. In 2005, another committee of the Indian Supreme Court charged that Vedanta had forced over one hundred indigenous families from their homes in the Indian state of Odisha, where it sought to mine bauxite. According to the committee's report: \\"An atmosphere of fear was created through the hired goons\\", and residents were \\"beaten up by the employees of M/s Vedanta\\". Vedanta's actions in Odisha were rebuked by the British commerce agency, and the Church of England investment funds sold their shares in the company in protest. In Zambia, Vedanta dumped hazardous waste into the Kafue River, from its copper mine there, according to a lawsuit filed by 2,000 residents, resulting in widespread human illness and the death of fish. A local judge stated: \\"This was lack of corporate responsibility and criminal, and a tipping point for corporate recklessness\\". In 2014, an audit was begun by Zambian officials due to suspicions that Vedanta has not been paying its proper fees to the government. In addition, \\"hundreds of former mine workers are fighting Vedanta for severance or disability pay.\\" = Thoothukudi Massacre = In March and April 2018, there were renewed mass- protests against the company's plans of setting up a second smelting complex and to demand a shutdown of its Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) smelting plants, on grounds of violating environmental regulations. On 22 May 2018 the protests took a deadlier turn as 13 people were killed and several others injured, following a police shooting. Section 144 was imposed to control the situation. Philanthropy  In 1992, Anil Agarwal created the Vedanta Foundation as the vehicle through which the group companies would carry out their philanthropic programs and activities. In the financial year 2013‚Äì14, the Vedanta group companies and the Vedanta foundation invested US$49.0 million in building hospitals, schools and infrastructure, conserving the environment and funding community programs that improve health, education and livelihood of over 4.1 million people. The initiatives were undertaken in partnership with the government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Among his inspirations, Agarwal counts Andrew Carnegie and David Rockefeller who built public works with their fortunes, and Bill Gates. The activities funded by his philanthropy are focused on child welfare, women empowerment and education. Anil Agarwal was ranked second in Hurun India Philanthropy List 2014 for his personal donation of Rs. 1,796 crore (about $36 million). He was ranked 25th in the Hurun India Rich List with a personal fortune of 12,316cr. In 2015, the Vedanta group in partnership with Ministry for Women and Child development inaugurated the first \\"Nand Ghar\\" or modern anganwadi, of the 4,000 planned to set up. Agarwal has pledged to donate 75% of his family's wealth to charity, saying he was inspired by Bill Gates.

He was less successful as a businessman and died having been imprisoned for debt. Beaumont was the youngest of four sons born to Sir Nicholas Beaumont and his wife Ann (Saunders). They were an aristocratic family in the English East Midlands. There were several branches to the Beaumont dynasty and this was the one based at Coleorton in Leicestershire. He was therefore of gentleman status in the formal Elizabethan sense. The family owned coal bearing lands and worked them. Beaumont was involved in this coal working and eventually he began working in his own right in the Nottingham area. In 1603/04, during his partnership with Sir Percival Willoughby, Lord of the Wollaton Manor, Beaumont constructed the Wollaton Wagonway. 21st century research has established that this is not the world's first wagonway with edged rails, but the earliest known specific documentary evidence relates to it and so it was attributed as such by earlier writers. The wagonway ran from Strelley, where Beaumont held mining leases, to Wollaton Lane. Beaumont was a successful coal prospector and an innovator in the development of mining techniques. A key innovation currently attributed to him is the introduction of boring rods to assist in finding coal without sinking a shaft. His working life covered involvement in coal mining activities in Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Northumberland. His coal mining and waggonway activities in the early 1600s near Blyth in Northumberland were, like most of his ventures, unprofitable but the boring rod and wagonway technology he took with him was implemented by others to significant effect. The wagonway chain he started in the English north east was to later influence George Stephenson. A major coal seam in the region was named the Beaumont Seam, commemorating his engineering efforts there.Doyle, Aiden Sacrifice, Achievement, Gratitude: Images of the Great Northern Coalfield in Decline 1997 p.20 Beaumont lost considerable sums of money borrowed from friends and family. He died in Nottingham Gaol in 1624 having been imprisoned for debt. Smith (1957) hypothesised Beaumont's business management decisions were reckless, the losses directly attributable to his mismanagement. New (2014) outlines a different perspective; Beaumont took over the Wollaton coal operation when it was almost worked out and facing closure, he applied what were for the time appropriate management actions delaying for 20 years what hindsight identifies was inevitable failure.

He is best known for his systematic demonstration of the comparative history of the Finno-Ugric languages in the book Affinitas linguae hungaricae cum linguis fennicae originis grammatice demonstrata (1799), which rested on the earlier work of J√°nos Sajnovics. Life and works Gyarmathi studied to be a teacher in Nagyenyed (Aiud) before training to be a doctor in Vienna, after which he practised medicine in Transylvania. In 1789 he read of a competition offering a prize for linguistic research in a Hungarian newspaper and spent the next two years working on his Okoskodva tan√≠t√≥ magyar nyelvmester (Hungarian Grammar Taught Rationally). The Transylvanian Diet made funds available for its publication and it appeared in two volumes in 1794. A plaque in G√∂ttingen Through the success of this book, Gyarmathi joined the household of Count Gergely Bethlen as a family physician and tutor to the Bethlen children. His position gave him plenty of leisure for his research into languages and allowed him to accompany Bethlen's son on a trip to the University of G√∂ttingen in Germany, then a leading centre for comparative linguistics. Here he made the acquaintance of the historian August Ludwig von Schl√∂zer, who was a specialist in Northern and Eastern Europe. In G√∂ttingen, Gyarmathi developed the theories of J√°nos Sajnovics, which had shown a relationship between Hungarian and Sami (Lapp). The result of Gyarmathi's studies was Affinitas, published in G√∂ttingen in 1799. In the first part of the work, Gyarmathi compares Hungarian, Finnish and Sami. In the second, he treats of the similarities between Hungarian and Estonian. In the third, he covers several other Uralic languages. Affinitas sought to show that these languages were part of the same family, by demonstrating similarities in grammatical structure between them. The book was immediately recognised as a major contribution to linguistics. After leaving G√∂ttingen, Gyarmathi became a teacher/administrator at the Calvinist College in Zilah (ZalƒÉu), before returning to work as the family physician to the Bethlens in 1810. His last major work was Vocabularium, published in Vienna in 1816. This is a word list that compares Hungarian vocabulary with 57 other languages. It also contains valuable information on the Szekler dialect of Transylvania. Gyarmathi died in Cluj at the age of 79.

History =Second Boer War= The brigade was first formed in December 1899 as 12th Infantry Brigade and saw action at the Battle of Rensburg, Battle of Norval's Point, Battle of Biddulph's Berg and Battle of Slabbert's Nek. =First World War= During the First World War, the 12th Brigade, a regular army formation, was assigned to the 4th Infantry Division. It was dispatched to France, crossing the English Channel on 22 August 1914, as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and saw action in the First Battle of the Marne beginning in September 1914. It then spent much of the rest of the conflict engaged in trench warfare. Order of battle The 12th Brigade was constituted as follows during the war: *1st Battalion, King's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment) *2nd Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers *2nd Battalion, Essex Regiment *2nd Battalion, Duke of Wellington's (West Riding Regiment) (from January 1916 to 10th Brigade February 1918) *2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment (from March 1915, to 11th Brigade July 1915) *1/5th Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment (from February 1915 until January 1916) *1/2nd Battalion, Monmouthshire Regiment (until January 1916) From early November 1915 until February 1916 the 12th Brigade was swapped with the 107th (Ulster) Brigade of the 36th (Ulster) Division. =Second World War= Men of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers in a trench in front of the Maginot Line, 3 January 1940. During the Second World War, except for a few brief periods of detachment, the brigade formed part of the 4th Infantry Division, as in the First World War. It was part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and took part in Battle of France and the subsequent Dunkirk evacuation in May‚ÄìJune 1940. The brigade remained in the United Kingdom for the next two years, preparing and training to repel Operation Sea Lion, the German invasion of England, although that never arrived. It moved to North Africa in February 1943 to take part in the later stages of the Tunisian Campaign and saw action at the Battle of Oved Zara, the Battle of Medjez Plain and the Battle of Tunis. It then took part in the Italian Campaign, moving to Naples in February 1944 and saw further action at the Fourth Battle of Monte Cassino. By October 1944 the 4th Division was taking part in the British Eighth Army's battle on the Gothic Line but was withdrawn in November to spend the rest of the war in Greece, part of the Allied force tasked to prevent civil unrest as rival factions attempted to fill the political vacuum when the Germans withdrew from the country. Order of battle The 12th Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war: * 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers * 1st Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment (until June 1940) * 1st Battalion, Black Watch (until March 1940) * 6th Battalion, Black Watch (from March 1940) * 1st Battalion, Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment (from September 1940) =Post-1945= The brigade was disbanded in March 1947, but reformed from 91 Lorried Infantry Brigade in April 1956. During the 1970s, it was one of two \\"square\\" brigades assigned to 2nd Armoured Division. After being briefly converted to \\"Task Force Delta\\" in the late 1970s, the brigade was reinstated in 1981,Watson, p. 76 assigned to 1st Armoured Division and based at Quebec Barracks at Osnabr√ºck. It remained with 1st Armoured Division, apart from a spell under HQ 3rd Armoured Division during Operation Granby, until disbandment under Options for Change. Following the Strategic Defence Review in 1998, the brigade was reformed in mechanized form under 3rd Mechanised Division at Aldershot Garrison: it relocated to Ward Barracks in Bulford Camp in February 2004.

The Society came into being at a meeting in July 1930 held in the Caxton Hall, London, at which the prime mover was Sir Michael O'Dwyer, a former Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, following correspondence between the 4th Marquess of Salisbury and George Clarke, 1st Baron Sydenham of Combe.Barberis, Peter, John McHugh, & Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003, ), p. 99 Its activists were mostly former members of the Indian Civil Service and included several former provincial governors of British India, among them O'Dwyer, Lord Meston, and Sir Reginald Craddock. Its principal goal was to resist the policy of Indian constitutional reform which successive British governments of the 1930s had begun to pursue.

Sprague as one of a pair of theatres, along with the Ambassadors Theatre, also in West Street. Richard Verney, 19th Baron Willoughby de Broke, together with B. A. (Bertie) Meyer, commissioned Sprague to design the theatre buildings. Although the Ambassadors opened in 1913, construction of the St Martin's was delayed by the outbreak of the First World War. The theatre is still owned by the present Lord Willoughby de Broke and his family. .

Since 2006 Geological Survey Ireland has managed the successor programme INFOMAR (Integrated Mapping for the Sustainable Development of Ireland's Marine Resources), which is completing the mapping of all Irish waters. INFOMAR is funded by the Geological Survey Ireland parent Department and undertaken in conjunction with the Marine Institute Ireland.

It premiered at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival, and was an entry for the S√©lection Officielle (Official Selection). It was adapted from the novel of the same name by Jean Rhys. Plot The beautiful Marya \\"Mado\\" Zelli (Isabelle Adjani) is living with her husband Stephan (Anthony Higgins), a Polish art dealer, in 1927 Paris. When he is convicted of selling stolen artwork, and imprisoned for one year, Marya is left penniless, with no means to support herself. At Stephan's urging, she moves into the apartment of some acquaintances, H.J. Heidler (Alan Bates), a wealthy English art dealer, and his wife Lois (Maggie Smith), a painter. H.J. has a history of inviting vulnerable young women to move into the \\"spare room\\" only to seduce them. Lois permits this arrangement because she wants to keep H.J. from leaving her. Marya becomes involved in the decadent Parisien lifestyle of the Heidlers and their group of fellow expatriates. Although she initially resists H.J.'s advances, Mado eventually begins an affair with him. The strain of living with the Heidlers begins to manifest itself; Marya becomes desperate to leave, and begs Lois to loan her money so she can get away. Lois, although extremely unhappy with the situation, is reluctant to interfere at the risk of alienating H.J. Her behavior towards Marya is increasingly passive-aggressive and insulting. During a hunting excursion to the countryside, Marya angrily confronts the pair, causing Lois to break down in anguish. After this H.J. arranges for Marya to live in a hotel, where he visits her less and less for sexual trysts. She grows lonely and depressed, contemplating suicide. During a tea party at the Heidlers', Lois casually reveals that H.J.'s previous mistress drowned herself in despair. When things are at their worst, Stephan is released from prison and must leave France immediately. Heidler threatens to break with her entirely if she returns to her husband, and although Marya has longed to be re-united with Stephan, she is unable to choose between the two. Stephan realizes the truth, and the film ends with him abandoning Marya to an uncertain future. Cast *Isabelle Adjani as Marya Zelli (nickname Mado) *Alan Bates as H. J.

He was born in inner city Liverpool but shortly afterwards moved to the new Cantril Farm housing estate, and on leaving school in July 1981 he joined Everton, turning professional for the 1983‚Äì84 season under the management of Howard Kendall ‚Äì who had taken over during the same summer that Bishop had first joined the club. However, he failed to break into the first team at Goodison Park, played just once in the First Division. He then tried his luck in the Fourth Division as one of Dario Gradi's first signings for her Crewe Alexandra. Bishop established his reputation at Carlisle United where he made 132 appearances from 1984 to 1988 prior to moving to Bournemouth. He then signed for Manchester City in the summer of 1989 for ¬£465,000 in a deal involving Paul Moulden on City's promotion to the First Division. Bishop was a good passer of the ball and in his 24 appearances for Manchester City in his first spell helped the team demolish their local rivals Manchester United 5‚Äì1 scoring City's third goal, on 23 September 1989. Despite being popular with the Manchester City supporters he was sold by then manager Howard Kendall to West Ham United in December 1989. Bishop joined in the same week as Trevor Morley and Colin Foster, as manager Lou Macari continued to rebuild the West Ham squad. He spent the majority of his career at West Ham, playing 284 times between 1989 and 1998, scoring 16 goals and becoming something of a cult figure. Although Macari resigned before the season ended, he remained in favour under his successor Billy Bonds and then under the management of Harry Redknapp. In early 1998, having become surplus to requirements at the Boleyn Ground, he returned to Manchester City, who were now battling against relegation to Division Two. His second spell at the club saw the team relegated to what was then Division Two, but then promoted to Division One and in the following season to the Premier League, thus becoming the first team to reach the FA Premier League with back-to-back promotions (although a number of clubs had reached the old First Division in this pattern). Bishop was an integral player in the team which earned promotion to the Premier League but only played ten times for the club in the top flight as they fought an ultimately unsuccessful battle against relegation. By the time City's relegation battle was lost, Bishop had headed across the Atlantic to sign for Miami Fusion.

The SAV identifies itself as a \\"revolutionary, socialist organization in the tradition of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, Luxemburg and Liebknecht\\", and it \\"stands for resistance, solidarity and socialism\\".Statut der SAV Grundsatzprogramm der SAV  History  The SAV originated in 1973 as a grouping around the monthly newspaper VORAN (\\"ahead\\"). The Voran Group entered the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and its youth wing, Jusos, to promote a revolutionary Marxist platform.\\"30 Jahre VORAN und SAV\\" Like many leftist groups, the VORAN Group hoped that the economic slowdown of the 1970s would draw workers (especially Social Democrats) to the far left. The group was the German section of the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI), which was led by Ted Grant and the British Militant tendency.\\"Das Komitee f√ºr eine Arbeiterinternationale\\" (20 February 2004) During the early 1980s membership of VORAN grew from fifty to 250 members, according to official sources. The group campaigned against German rearmament, NATO activities and nuclear power plants. The group remained ambivalent about the emergent Green Party, which it regarded as a \\"middle-class movement.\\" The group also organized a national campaign in support of the British miners' strike, and attempted to radicalize German industrial workers and their unions. Following German reunification in 1990, the VORAN Group took part in the Antifa movement, which was growing in response to the reemergence of far-right and Neonazi groups. In October 1992, VORAN and other CWI affiliates formed Youth against Racism in Europe (in German \\"Jugend gegen Rassismus in Europa\\", JRE). After long-going debate in the organization, VORAN split from the SPD in 1994, claiming that the party had become too middle-class and bureaucratic. Some members chose to leave VORAN and remain in the SPD. In May 1994 the group was reorganized as Socialist Alternative. In May 2002 the SAV changed its publication's name from VORAN to Solidarit√§t - Sozialistische Zeitung (\\"Solidarity: Socialist Newspaper\\"). It helped to organize the campaign Jugend gegen Krieg (\\"Youth Against War\\") following the start of the Iraq War. SAV members became involved in the Labour and Social Justice Electoral List (WASG), following the latter group's split from the SPD in 2005. SAV activists stood as WASG in a number of elections. SAV member Lucy Redler led the WASG list in the 2006 Berlin state election.\\"Landesvorstand der WASG Berlin abgesetzt\\" The WASG participation in this election was controversial, since it competed with the allied Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). In 2007 the WASG and the PDS merged to form the Left Party. Many of the SAV's West German members joined the Left Party along with the western-based WASG. In September 2008 the group instructed its Berlin and East German branches to join the Left Party, as well. When Redler applied for membership in the party, it sparked controversy as party leadership member Klaus Ernst objected to her membership and that of several other prominent SAV members since they were vocal critics of the WASG-PDS merger, and she had run in the 2006 Berlin elections against the PDS. The issue of Redler's membership even appeared in the pages of major newspapers, such as Der Spiegel, Die Welt and the Berliner Morgenpost.Katharina Peters, \\"Linke hadern mit der roten Lucy\\", Der Spiegel (28 October 2008)\\"Linkspartei-Vize k√§mpft gegen Redlers Beitritt\\", Welt Online (29 October 2008)\\"Linken-Streit um Lucy Redler eskaliert\\", Berliner Morgenpost (30 October 2008) In June 2013, Heidrun Dittrich, a Member of the Bundestag for the Left Party, joined Socialist Alternative. After the CWI split in 2019, SAV held a party congress in which two-thirds of the membership voted to support the CWI Majority.

Though technically not a \\"battle\\", it became known as such in the media while official sources such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) simply refer to it as an \\"incident\\". Much of its notoriety lies in the fact that it marked the first occasion the South African security forces used lethal force against right-wing white protesters since the National Party's ascension to power in 1948. Background AWB Rally, Church Square, Pretoria in 1990. The confrontation took place outside the Ventersdorp town hall where then State President F.W. de Klerk was scheduled to hold a public address. Ventersdorp was then a political stronghold of the right-wing Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), which had opposed de Klerk's decision to recognise the African National Congress and release Nelson Mandela the previous year. The town was inundated by angry AWB supporters the day of de Klerk's speech, including some carrying arms. The South African Police responded by setting up roadblocks and confiscating weapons. Tensions were running high between the police and the AWB due to a previous incident on 11 May 1991, when a group of policemen wounded four AWB militants attempting to drive black squatters off a Ventersdorp farm. Confrontation The AWB supporters numbered 2,000. They were armed with hunting rifles and pistols and wore protective items to shield them from the effects of an inevitable tear gas attack by the riot police. The police equalled the AWB in number, but were considerably better trained and equipped. Many unconventional tactics were employed by the AWB. They allegedly wore plaster of Paris on their limbs to protect them from police dogs. Video footage shows AWB members locking arms and carrying rags and vinegar to lessen the effects of tear gas. Once the AWB cut the electricity and fired on the police, the police were ordered to shoot to kill. Three policemen were wounded, none of them fatally, while the police killed one AWB member. The AWB also fired into a police minibus. Two AWB members were killed and 13 were injured when the police returned fire from the minibus. Terre'Blanche made a point of appearing in front on television cameras and said (in Afrikaans), \\"Where is De Klerk? I want to talk to him. He came here armed. Here lies a man on the ground and over there lies a man\\" (referring to injured policemen). In all, three AWB members and one passer-by were killed. Six policemen, 13 AWB members, and 29 civilians were injured. Aftermath The growing conflict between right-wing groupings and the government has been identified as one of the most significant developments in the course of 1991, with the Battle of Ventersdorp as its high point. The events in Ventersdorp, as well as gains by the right-wing opposition in white by-elections, led De Klerk to call a referendum in March 1992. The referendum confirmed white support for the negotiation process, despite continued opposition from the far right. Following the end of apartheid, Terre'Blanche and his supporters sought amnesty for the Battle of Ventersdorp and other acts. Amnesty was granted by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The three dead AWB members, A.F. Badenhorst, G.J. Koen and J.D. Conradie were honoured at an AWB ceremony in October 1994, in Ventersdorp. A monument still remembers their death.

The trunk is erect, up to 7 m tall and about 10 cm in diameter. Fronds are pinnate or bipinnate and grow to 2 m in length. The underside of the rachis is pubescent and has occasional scales towards the base. The scales range in colour from brown to bicoloured (pale with brown margins). Sori occur along each side of the pinnule midvein and are covered by scale-like indusia. A. bryophila is a slow growing species, reportedly only increasing in trunk height by 5 cm a year, a growth rate more akin to that of Dicksonia species. It has been estimated that plants may live in excess of 150 years. The closest relatives of A. bryophila appear to be Alsophila brooksii, Alsophila hotteana and Alsophila minor. The specific epithet bryophila, meaning \\"bryophyte loving\\", refers to the fact that this species is commonly encountered in mossy forest. A. bryophila may be cultivated, although it requires consistently cool and moist conditions to do well. It is apparently more susceptible to insect damage than most other species. In the horticultural trade, A. bryophila is often erroneously called \\"Cyathea pubescens\\", although this is a synonym of an unrelated species (Alsophila auneae).

From August 1914 until the end of World War I on 11 November 1918, Luxembourg was under full occupation by the German Empire. The German government justified the occupation by citing the need to support their armies in neighbouring France, although many Luxembourgers, contemporary and present, have interpreted German actions otherwise. During this period, Luxembourg was allowed to retain its own government and political system, but all proceedings were overshadowed by the German army's presence. Despite the overbearing distraction of the occupation, the Luxembourgish people attempted to lead their lives as normally as possible. The political parties attempted to focus on other matters, such as the economy, education, and constitutional reform. The domestic political environment was further complicated by the death of Paul Eyschen, who had been Prime Minister for 27 years. With his death came a string of short-lived governments, culminating in rebellion, and constitutional turmoil after the withdrawal of German soldiers.  Background  Since the 1867 Treaty of London, Luxembourg had been an explicitly neutral state. The Luxembourg Crisis had seen Prussia thwart France's attempt to purchase the Grand Duchy from the Netherlands. Luxembourg's neutrality was accepted by Prussia's then- Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, who boasted, \\"In exchange for the fortress of Luxembourg, we have been compensated by the neutrality of the country, and a guarantee that it shall be maintained in perpetuity.\\"Speech by Bismarck to the North German Reichstag (in German), 27 September 1867. In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the thrones of Austria-Hungary, was assassinated by pan-Slavic nationalists, leading to a sudden deterioration in relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. Austria-Hungary was supported by the German Empire, while Serbia had the backing of the Russian Empire. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia, which, in turn, required the mobilisation of Russia, hence of Germany, thanks to its responsibilities under the Dual Alliance. Under the Schlieffen Plan, Germany sought to bypass the French defences by moving through Luxembourg and Belgium. Anticipating a retaliatory declaration of war from Russia's closest western ally, France, Germany put into action the Schlieffen Plan. Under this military strategy, formulated by Count Schlieffen in 1905, Germany would launch a lightning attack on France through the poorly defended Low Countries. This would bypass France's main defences, arranged to the south. Germany's army would be able to encircle Paris, force France to surrender, and turn its full attention to the Eastern Front. Since the 1860s, Luxembourgers had been keenly aware of German ambition,Calmes (1989), p. 340 and Luxembourg's government was well aware of the implications of the Schlieffen Plan. In 1911, Prime Minister Paul Eyschen commissioned an engineer to evaluate Germany's western railroad network, particularly the likelihood that Germany would occupy Luxembourg to suit its logistical needs for a campaign in France. Operational Intelligence Report. 24 September 1911. Retrieved on 23 July 2006.Luxembourg Railways Intelligence Report Moreover, given the strong ethnic and linguistic links between Luxembourg and Germany, it was feared that Germany might seek to annex Luxembourg into its empire. The government of Luxembourg aimed to avoid this by re-affirming the country's neutrality.Thewes (2003), p. 56  Invasion  Germany's main invasion thrust was towards Luxembourg City. On 1 August 1914, Germany declared war on Russia. On the outbreak of war with its eastern neighbour, Germany put the Schlieffen Plan into action, and Luxembourg's government's fears were realised. Initially, Luxembourg was only a transit point for Albrecht von W√ºrttemberg's Fourth Army. One of the railways from the northern Rhineland into France passed through Troisvierges, in the far north of Luxembourg, and Germany's first infringement of Luxembourg's sovereignty and neutrality was the unauthorised use of Troisvierges station.Telegram from Eyschen to Jagow (in German), 1 August 1914. Eyschen protested, but could do nothing to prevent Germany's incursion. The next day, while French troops were still at a distance from the German frontier, Germany launched a full invasion.Otte, 2014 Chapter 7 p. 487 German soldiers began moving through south-eastern Luxembourg, crossing the Moselle River at Remich and Wasserbillig, and headed towards the capital, Luxembourg City.Telegram from Eyschen to assorted foreign ministers (in French), 2 August 1914. Tens of thousands of German soldiers had been deployed to Luxembourg in those 24 hours (although the Grand Duchy's government disputed any precise number that was suggested).Speech by Eyschen to the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies (in French), 3 August 1914. Grand Duchess Marie-Ad√©la√Øde ordered that the Grand Duchy's small army, which numbered under 400, not to resist. On the afternoon of 2 August she and Eyschen met the German commander Oberst Richard Karl von Tessmar on Luxembourg City's Adolphe Bridge, the symbol of Luxembourg's modernisation. They protested mildly, but both the young Grand Duchess and her aging statesman accepted German military rule as inevitable.O'Shaughnessy (1932), p. 155 Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, German Chancellor On 2 August, German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg justified the complete occupation of Luxembourg in terms of military necessity, arguing that France was ready to invade Luxembourg itself.Telegram from Bethmann-Hollweg to Eyschen (in German), 2 August 1914. The French minister in Luxembourg dismissed this argument, claiming that it would not have considered violating Luxembourg's neutrality unless Germany had done so first.Letter from Mollard to Eyschen (in French), 3 August 1914. Bethmann Hollweg attempted to prove his country's regret by offering Luxembourg compensation for the losses due to the military presence. On 4 August, Bethmann Hollweg told the Reichstag: However, when it seemed that Germany was on the verge of victory, the Chancellor began to revise his statements. In his Septemberprogramm, Bethmann Hollweg called for Luxembourg to become a German federal state, and for that result to be forced upon the Luxembourgish people once Germany achieved victory over the Triple Entente. Septemberprogramm des Reichskanzlers Theobald von Bethmann- Hollweg. 9 September 1914. Retrieved on 23 July 2006. However, the British and French halted the German advance at the Battle of the Marne in mid-September. This resulted in the indefinite continuation of German occupation.  Eyschen government  Eyschen's long premiership had been one of peace and prosperity. Just as the war was in the balance on the Western Front, so the fate of Luxembourg was see-sawing back and forth. It was clear to all that the good conduct of the Luxembourgish government, if fully receptive to the needs of the German military administrators, could guarantee Luxembourg's continued self-government, at least in the short-term. Eyschen was a familiar and overwhelmingly popular leader, and all factions put their utmost faith in his ability to steer Luxembourg through the diplomatic minefield that was occupation. On 4 August, he expelled the French minister in Luxembourg at the request of the German minister,Telegram from Eyschen to Mollard (in French), 4 August 1914 followed by the Belgian minister four days later and the Italian minister when his country entered the war. To the same end, Eyschen refused to speak ill of the German Zollverein, even though he had talked openly of exiting the customs union before the war began.Letter from Eyschen to Nyssens (in French), 28 December 1882. On occasions, Eyschen rebuked the occupying forces. On 13 October, a Luxembourgish journalist named Karl Dardar was arrested by the German army for publishing anti-German stories. He was then taken to Koblenz, and tried and sentenced by court-martial to three months imprisonment. Eyschen was outraged that the Germans had kidnapped a Luxembourgish citizen and tried him for an extraterritorial offence, and Eyschen did nothing to hide his indignation. Eyschen told the German minister in Luxembourg that the action was a 'direct injury to the Grand Duchy's national sovereignty'.Telegram from Eyschen to Buch (in German), 8 December 1914. Similar complaints were made, by both Eyschen and Victor Thorn, when a railway worker was arrested in January 1915 for allegedly working for French military intelligence, and subsequently tried and sentenced in Trier. As Minister for Justice, Thorn was incensed that the Luxembourgish legal system had been treated with such disdain.Telegram from Thorn to Berg (in German), 1 February 1915. Such objections were not received well by the German authorities. Although they tired of Eyschen's stubborn ways, he remained a useful tool to unite the various Luxembourgish political factions. On 23 June a letter was sent to the Luxembourg government stating that the Germans considered Luxembourg to be a theatre of war and that the population, therefore, was subject to military law.David Heal, Victims Nonetheless: The invasion of Luxembourg, 1914 (2010) Eyschen was not the only person to be politically active during the occupation. In the summer of 1915, Eyschen pushed to further reduce the role of the Catholic Church in the state school system. Grand Duchess Marie-Ad√©la√Øde objected. A fervently religious Catholic (as was most of the country, but not her late father, who was Protestant), she was reputed to have said, \\"I will not allow their most precious heritage [Roman Catholicism] to be stolen while I have the key.\\"O'Shaughnessy (1932), pp. 134‚Äì135 Marie-Ad√©la√Øde refused to budge, inviting Eyschen to resign if he could not accept her decision. Eyschen nearly resigned, but decided not to.Calmes (1989), p. 93 Nevertheless, he died shortly after.  After Eyschen  = Eyschen's death = The outpouring of national grief at Eyschen's funeral was evidence of the nation's debt to him. His death in office led to three years of political upheaval. On 11 October, Luxembourg's political system was brought to its knees by the death of Paul Eyschen.Thewes (2003), p. 64. When war broke out, Eyschen had been 73 years old, but his premiership of 27 years was the only government that most Luxembourgers had known. Throughout the first year of German occupation, he had been a rock for the Luxembourgish people. He had also been of great importance to Marie-Ad√©la√Øde; the Grand Duchess had never been groomed for the position,O'Shaughnessy (1932), p. 65. was 53 years Eyschen's junior, and was considered both politically na√Øve and dangerously partisan for a constitutional monarch. The recent strains were relatively cosmetic. Critically, Eyschen had the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, and he had managed to hold together a government containing all major factions, seemingly by force of personality alone. To make matters worse for national unity, the strain of occupation had broken apart the pre-war anti-clericalist alliance between the socialist and the liberal factions, thus depriving both the clericalists and anti-clericalists of a legislative majority. The Catholic conservatives formed the largest bloc, but they were least likely to form a majority coalition. = Mongenast government = The day after Eyschen's death, Grand Duchess Marie-Ad√©la√Øde invited Mathias Mongenast, who had been Minister for Finance since 1882, to form a minority government. Mongenast's special status as a 'caretaker' Prime Minister is underlined by his official title; he was not 'President of the Government', as all other Prime Ministers since 1857 had been, but held the lesser title of 'President of the Council'.Thewes (2003), p. 65. Mongenast's administration was never intended to be long-lived, and Marie-Ad√©la√Øde's main objective when appointing the experienced Mongenast was to steady the ship. Nevertheless, nobody expected the government to fall as soon as it did. On 4 November, Mongenast nominated a new candidate for head of Luxembourg's √©cole normale. The nomination did not meet with Grand Ducal approval, and Marie-Ad√©la√Øde rejected him. Mongenast persisted; education had been a hobby horse of his, and he imagined that the Grand Duchess would accept the advice of a minister as experienced as he was. He was wrong; the Grand Duchess had always been single-minded, and resented a minority Prime Minister, particularly one so new to the job, making demands of her. The next day, Mongenast resigned, just 25 days after being given the job. = Loutsch government = Having fought with Mongenast, the Grand Duchess decided to appoint an all-conservative cabinet led by Hubert Loutsch. The Chamber of Deputies was steadfastly opposed; the Party of the Right held only 20 seats out of 52, but they formed the plurality.Thewes (2003), p. 66 Marie-Ad√©la√Øde sought to end this deadlock by dissolving the Chamber of Deputies and by calling for the voters to grant a mandate to the conservatives. This outraged the left, which assumed that its deputies alone had the constitutional right to grant the government confidence; it was dubbed by those on the left a 'coup d'√©tat by the Grand Duchess'.Kreins (2003), p. 88. Nonetheless, on 23 December, Luxembourg went to the polls. Although the position of the Party of the Right was improved, taking 25 seats, it fell a whisker short of winning an absolute majority. On 11 January 1916, the Chamber of Deputies passed a motion of no confidence, and Loutsch resigned.  National Union Government  = Forming a consensus = After the failure of the all-conservative government, the Grand Duchess turned to the leading liberal politician, Victor Thorn, to form a new government. After Eyschen's premiership of 27 years, two governments had come and gone in three months, and the Luxembourgish people were becoming disillusioned with the failure of the politicians. Thorn's nature was to be a conciliatory leader, and he made a direct appeal to the Chamber of Deputies to support his government, no matter the deputies' individual ideological persuasions: \\"If you want a government that acts, and is capable of acting, it is imperative that all parties support this government.\\"Speech by Thorn to the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies (in French), February 1916 This support was forthcoming from all parties, but only on the condition that each was invited into the government; Thorn was left with no choice but to afford them this. The resulting grand coalition cabinet included every leading light in Luxembourgish politics; besides Thorn himself, there were the conservatives L√©on Kauffmann and Antoine Lefort, the socialist leader Dr Michel Welter, and the liberal L√©on Moutrier.Thewes (2003), p. 69. = Food shortage = The most pressing concern of the Luxembourgish government was that of food supply.Thewes (2003), p. 68. The war had made importation of food an impossibility, and the needs of the German occupiers inevitably came before those of the Luxembourgish people.Letter from Thorn to Buch (in German), 28 August 1916 To slow the food supply's diminishment, Michel Welter, the Director-General for both agriculture and commerce, banned the export of food from Luxembourg.Letter from Tessmar to assorted commanders (in German), 8 May 1916 Furthermore, the government introduced rationing and price controls to counteract the soaring demand and to make food more affordable for poorer Luxembourgers. However, the measures did not have the desired effect. Increasing numbers of Luxembourgers turned to the black market, and, to the consternation of the Luxembourgish government, the German army of occupation seemed to do little to help. Moreover, the government accused Germany of aiding the development of the black market by refusing to enforce regulations, and even of smuggling goods themselves. Through 1916, the food crisis deepened, compounded by a poor potato harvest across all of the Low Countries; in neighbouring Belgium, the harvest was between 30% and 40% down on the previous year.Letter from Hoover to Percy, 7 October 1916 Although many Luxembourgers were on near-starvation level dietary intakes, the country managed to avoid famine. In part, this was due to a reduction of German soldiers' dependence upon local food sources, instead relying on imports from Germany.Letter from Buch to Thorn (in German), 4 October 1916 Despite the avoidance of a famine, the Luxembourgish government lost much of the faith placed in it by the public and by the politicians. On 22 December, Michel Welter, the minister responsible, was censured by the Chamber of Deputies, which demanded his resignation. Thorn procrastinated, seeking any option but firing the leader of one of three major parties, but could find none. On 3 January 1917, Welter was fired, and replaced by another socialist, Ernest Lecl√®re. Even after the change and von Tessmar's promise of his soldiers' better conduct in future, L√©on Kauffmann was capable of citing thirty-six instances of German soldiers caught smuggling foodstuffs between March 1917 and June 1918.Letter from Kauffmann to Kirsch (in German), 26 September 1918 = Miners' strike = Von Tessmar's swift suppression of the strike undermined Thorn's government. Discontent amongst the population grew constantly, particularly in the country's industrialised south. The autumn of 1916 had seen the first unionisation within the iron and steel industries, with trade unions springing up in both Luxembourg City and Esch-sur-Alzette. Despite the war demand, iron production had slumped, leading to greater employment insecurity. In March and April, three independents were elected as deputies from the canton of Esch-sur-Alzette, where the economy was dominated by iron and steel. As independents, these newly elected deputies were the only legislative opposition to the National Union Government. For many Luxembourgers, particularly the miners, expression of disgust at the government could not be directed through the ballot box alone. Sensing the threat of civil disobedience or worse, von Tessmar threatened any individual committing an act of violence (in which he included strike action) with the death penalty.Proclamation by Tessmar to steel workers at Differdange (in German), 10 May 1917 However, on 31 May 1917, the workers sought to use their most potent weapon, by defying von Tessmar's ultimatum and downing tools.Telegram from Thorn to Arendt (in German), 2 June 1917 Germany was dependent upon Luxembourgish iron, as the British Royal Navy's naval blockade forced Germany to look to accessible local supplies; in 1916, Luxembourg produced over one-seventh of the Zollverein's pig iron.Zollverein pig iron production. National Bureau of Economic Research. Retrieved on 23 July 2006. As such, Germany simply could not afford a strike, lest it be deprived of critical raw materials. In putting down the strike, von Tessmar was ruthlessly efficient, but he was not required to resort to the executions that he had threatened. Within nine days, the strike was defeated and the leaders arrested.Letter from Kauffmann to Zimmerman (in German), 3 August 1917 The two ringleaders were then sentenced by German court-martial in Trier to ten years imprisonment, to the disgust of the government. The continued refusal of the German authorities to respect the Luxembourgish government, and the humiliating manner in which the strike was put down by German military muscle rather than the Luxembourgish gendarmerie, were too much for Thorn. On 19 June, the government resigned.  Kauffmann government  A house hit by a bomb, Rue de la Gare, 24 March 1918 Although the experiment in grand coalition had failed, the need for some political unity remained. As the National Union Government was collapsing, Kauffmann arranged an alliance between his Party of the Right and Moutrier's Liberal League, seeking to achieve change that would outlive the occupation.Thewes (2003), p. 72. The primary objective was to address the perennial grievances of the left by amending the constitution; in November, the Chamber of Deputies launched a wide-ranging series of debates on various amendments to the constitutions. Ultimately, the constitution was amended to prohibit the government from entering into secret treaties, to improve deputies' pay (hitherto set at just 5 francs a day), to introduce universal suffrage, and to change the plurality voting system to a proportional one. Whereas all of the above measures were broadly popular, across most of the political spectrum, the same was not true of the proposal to amend Article 32. Said article had not been amended in the overhaul of 1868, and its text had remained unchanged since the original constitution of 1848, stating unequivocally that all sovereignty resided in the person of the Grand Duchess. For some, particularly those that resented the close relations between Marie-Ad√©la√Øde and the German royalty, the idea of national sovereignty residing in such a person was unacceptable. The Chamber of Deputies voted to review Article 32, but Kauffmann refused to allow it, seeing the redefinition of the source of national sovereignty as covert republicanism. The summer of 1918 saw a dramatic decline in the fortunes of the government. On 8 July, Clausen, in central Luxembourg City, had been bombed by the British Royal Air Force, killing ten civilians. Although this did not endear the Allies to Luxembourgers, the Grand Duchess' instinct was to run to the Germans, who were even less popular amongst the people. On 16 August, German Chancellor Georg von Hertling paid a visit to Luxembourg; although Hertling asked only to see the Grand Duchess, Kauffmann asked that he also attend. To the Luxembourgish people, relations between the two countries now seemed unambiguously cordial, and all that was left of Kauffmann's credibility disappeared. This was compounded further by the news on 26 August of the engagement of the Grand Duchess' sister, Princess Antonia, to Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, who was Generalfeldmarschall in the German army.Thewes (2003), p. 74. Pressure mounted on Kauffmann; with his party still strong, but with his personal reputation shattered, he was left with no option but to resign, which he did on 28 September in favour of √âmile Reuter, another conservative.Thewes (2003), p. 76.  End of the war  = Armistice = General John Joseph Pershing By the autumn of 1918, Germany's position in the war was becoming untenable. The massive Spring Offensive had been an unmitigated disaster, whereas the Allied counterattack, the Hundred Days Offensive, had driven the German Army back to its own borders. On 6 November, von Tessmar announced the full withdrawal of German soldiers from Luxembourg.Letter from Tessmar to Reuter (in German), 6 November 1918. Five days after von Tessmar's announcement, Germany signed an armistice treaty, which brought an end to the war of four years. One of the terms of the armistice involved the withdrawal of German soldiers from Luxembourg, along with the other occupied countries. La convention d'armistice , Article A(II). 11 November 1918. Retrieved on 20 February 2012. The Allied powers agreed that the German withdrawal from Luxembourg would be observed by the United States, and that the United States would receive the honour of liberating the captive country. On 18 November, American General John Joseph \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) on the Western Front, issued a proclamation to the people of Luxembourg, stating that the United States' newly formed Third Army would move through Luxembourg to occupy the German Rhineland, but that the Americans would come as allies and as liberators: 1 December 1918. Soldiers from the American 125th Infantry Regiment crossing the Sauer at Echternach, and becoming amongst the first Allied soldiers to enter Germany after the armistice. The following day, American soldiers crossed the Franco-Luxembourgish border. Everywhere, they were f√™ted as liberators, in the spirit that Pershing had intended to inspire, and were met by bands and civilians waving flags, and were adorned with flowers.. US Third Army, 14 July 2004. Retrieved on 20 February 2012 at the Wayback Machine Internet Archive Luc Housse, the Mayor of Luxembourg City, told the advancing American army that the Germans had, on the whole, been disciplined and well-behaved in the previous three weeks: a marked improvement upon his numerous complaints earlier in the conflict. Finally, on 22 November 1918, the German army completed its withdrawal from Luxembourg, ending its occupation. Germany's defeat created the perfect opportunity for the Allied powers to resolve the Luxembourgish question once and for all. By removing Luxembourg from Germany's sphere of influence, they hoped to guarantee its continued independence, and thus preserve the peace they had won. On 19 December, at the instigation of the British and French governments, the Luxembourgish government announced its withdrawal from the Zollverein and an end to the railway concessions that Luxembourg had previously granted Germany.Thewes (2003), p. 79. = Rebellion = Although the Allies were satisfied at this remedy, at the time, the Luxembourgish government was threatened by a communist insurgency. After the retreat of the German army, revolutionaries established Russian-influenced Workers' councils across Luxembourg. On 10 November, the day after Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg declared a similar 'socialist republic' in Germany, communists in Luxembourg City declared a republic, but it lasted for only a matter of hours.Kreins (2003), p. 89. Another revolt took place in Esch-sur-Alzette in the early hours of 11 November, but also failed.Thewes (2003), p. 81. The socialists had been fired up by the behaviour of Grand Duchess Marie-Ad√©la√Øde, whose interventionist and obstructive streak had stymied even Eyschen. On 12 November, socialist and liberal politicians, finding their old commonality on the issue, called for her abdication.Dostert et al. (2002), p. 21. A motion in the Chamber of Deputies demanding the abolition of the monarchy was defeated by 21 votes to 19 (with 3 abstentions), but the Chamber did demand the government hold a popular referendum on the issue. Although the left's early attempts at founding a republic had failed, the underlying cause of the resentment had not been addressed, and, as long as Marie-Ad√©la√Øde was Grand Duchess, the liberals would ally themselves to the socialists in opposition to her. The French government also refused to cooperate with a government led by a so-called 'collaborator'; French Foreign Minister St√©phen Pichon called cooperation 'a grave compromise with the enemies of France'. More pressing than either of these troubles, on 9 January, a company of the Luxembourgish army rebelled, declaring itself to be the army of the new republic, with √âmile Servais (the son of Emmanuel Servais) as 'Chairman of the Committee of Public Safety'.Luxembourg country profile. WorldStatesman.org. Retrieved on 23 July 2006. However, by January, the vacuum left by the German withdrawal had been filled by American and French soldiers. President of the Chamber Fran√ßois Altwies asked French troops to intervene.Kreins (2003), p. 90. Eager to put an end to what it perceived to be pro-Belgian revolutions, the French army crushed the would-be revolutionaries. Nonetheless, the disloyalty shown by her own armed forces was too much for Marie-Ad√©la√Øde, who abdicated in favour of her sister, Charlotte. Belgium, which had hoped to either annex Luxembourg or force it into personal union, grudgingly recognised Charlotte on 13 February.Kreins (2003), p. 91. The dynasty's hold on power would be tenuous until September 1919, when a referendum on the future of the Grand Duchy found 77.8% in favour of continued rule by the House of Nassau-Weilburg.Dostert et al. (2002), p. 22 = Paris Peace Conference = Despite the armistice ending the war, and the end of the revolts, Luxembourg's own future was still uncertain. Belgium was one of the countries hit hardest by the war; almost the whole of the country was occupied by Germany, and over 43,000 Belgians, including 30,000 civilians, had died as a result. Belgium sought compensation, and had its eye on any and all of its neighbours; in November 1918, Lord Hardinge, the Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office, told the Dutch ambassador in London, \\"The Belgians are on the make, and they want to grab whatever they can.\\" Delegates signing the Treaty of Versailles, ending the First World War and cementing Luxembourg's independence From early 1919, Belgium engaged in a propaganda campaign to promote its vision of annexation. At the Paris Peace Conference, the Belgian delegation argued in favour of the international community allowing Belgium to annex Luxembourg. However, fearing loss of influence over the left bank of the Rhine, France rejected Belgium's overtures out of hand, thus guaranteeing Luxembourg's continued independence. The resulting Treaty of Versailles set aside two articles (¬ß40 and ¬ß41) to address concerns for Luxembourg's status. The main article, ¬ß40, revoked all special privileges that Germany had acquired in Luxembourg, with Germany specifically renouncing advantages gained in the treaties of 1842, 1847, 1865, 1866, February 1867, May 1867, 1871, 1872, and 1902.Treaty of Versailles , Article 40. 28 June 1919. Retrieved on 23 July 2006. The effects of these treaties' revocation were then explicitly stated; Luxembourg would withdraw from the Zollverein, Germany would lose its right to use the Luxembourgish railways, and Germany was obligated to recognise the termination of Luxembourg's neutrality, thus validating the actions of the Luxembourgish government since the armistice. Furthermore, to prevent economic embargo after the end of the customs union, the treaty allowed Luxembourg an indefinite option on German coal,Treaty of Versailles, Annex V(5), 28 June 1919 and prohibited Germany from levying duty on Luxembourgish exports until 1924.Treaty of Versailles, Article 268(c), 28 June 1919  Luxembourgers overseas  The G√´lle Fra monument commemorates the thousands of Luxembourgers that volunteered for service in the armed forces of the Allies. Thousands of Luxembourgers overseas, unconstrained by the Luxembourgish government's need to remain neutral, signed up to serve with foreign armies. 3,700 Luxembourgish nationals served in the French Army, of whom over 2,000 died. As Luxembourg's pre-war population was only 266,000, the loss of life solely in the service of the French army amounted to almost 1 percent of the entire Luxembourgish population, relatively greater than the totals for many combatant countries (see: World War I casualties). The Luxembourgish volunteers are commemorated by the G√´lle Fra (literally 'Golden Lady' ) war memorial, which was unveiled in Luxembourg City on 27 May 1923. The original memorial was destroyed on 20 October 1940, during the Nazi occupation, as it symbolised the rejection of German identity and active resistance against Germanisation. After World War II, it was gradually rebuilt, culminating in its second unveiling, on 23 June 1985. The Luxembourgish community in the United States found itself confronted by a crisis of identity. Traditionally, they had identified themselves as ethnically German, rather than as a separate community of their own. As such, they read German language newspapers, attended German schools, and lived amongst German Americans. Nonetheless, when it became apparent that the war would not be over quickly, the opinions of Luxembourg Americans changed; on 2 May 1915, the Luxemburger Brotherhood of America's annual convention decided to adopt English as its only official language. Other organisations were less inclined to change their ways; the Luxemburger Gazette opposed President Woodrow Wilson's supposed 'favouritism' towards the United Kingdom as late in the war as 1917. However, when the United States entered the war in April of that year, the wavering members of the community supported the Allies, changing forever the relationship between the German and Luxembourgish communities in the US.

He is the Director of the World Community for Christian Meditation and of its Benedictine oblate community. Biography Born in England in 1951, he was educated by the Benedictines and studied English literature at New College, Oxford. Before entering monastic life he worked in the fields of banking and journalism and at the United Nations. In 1975, Freeman joined Fr John Main OSB at Ealing Abbey in London, as part of the first experimental lay community dedicated to living a Benedictine life with Christian meditation as its contemplative practice. From this was established the Christian Meditation Centre in London. In 1977 at the invitation of the Archbishop of Montreal, he went to Canada with Main to establish a Benedictine community of monks and laypeople dedicated to the practice and teaching of Christian meditation. Freeman studied theology at the Universit√© de Montr√©al and at McGill University. He made his solemn monastic profession of religious vows in 1979 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1980. After John Main‚Äôs death in 1982, Freeman continued the work of teaching meditation that had now begun to develop into a global community. He continues to travel the world giving talks and retreats. In 1991 he returned to live in England to establish the international centre of the newly formed World Community for Christian Meditation that is now present in over 100 countries. Strongly committed to inter-religious dialogue and international peace initiatives, between 1998 and 2000 Freeman took part in the historic \\"Way of Peace\\" programme ‚Äì a series of Christian-Buddhist dialogues with the Dalai Lama in India, Italy and Belfast. The programme continued in 2013 with further dialogues in Sarnath, India. In 2006 he co-hosted a meeting at York University exploring the common ground between Christianity and Islam. He was a keynote speaker at the World Parliament of Religions in Melbourne, Australia, in 2009. Freeman was awarded the Order of Canada in 2010 in recognition of his work of interfaith dialogue and the promotion of world peace. Freeman‚Äôs work also involves encouraging the teaching of meditation to children and students. He founded the John Main Center for Meditation and Inter-Religious Dialogue at Georgetown University in the United States and sees the contemplative dimension of knowledge as an essential characteristic of all true education. In 2010 he launched the Meditatio outreach programme of WCCM to mark the celebration of its twentieth anniversary. Meditatio hosts seminars, forums and workshops to engage in dialogue with the secular world and produces publications and resources on the themes of education, mental health, business, addiction and recovery, interfaith and other topics. Through the World Community for Christian Meditation, now established as a contemporary and ecumenical contemplative community, Freeman continues the work of teaching Christian meditation and restoring the contemplative as an essential and central dimension of all Christian spirituality.  Writings  Freeman is the author of many books, including Light Within, Selfless Self, Your Daily Practice, The Inner Pilgrimage, Jesus: The Teacher Within and First Sight: The Experience of Faith. He writes for journals and magazines and is a regular contributor to The Tablet. He is also the principal editor of John Main‚Äôs works. * Meditation (2019) *Sensing God: Meditation for Lent (2016) * Why are we here?

The body of the turbot is broad, even a small oval and flat, and their oval body is broader and thicker than other flounders. The overall size is richer than other gums and has a pointed little nose. There are many small black spots on the deep olive-green body. Some spots are from dark green to black, the abdomen is somewhat grayish, and there is a circle outside. The turbot has a small amount of thorns on its surface, and its dorsal fin is hard and long, extending from the tip of the nose, with short rays and almost to the back. Both sides of the body are heavily scaled with small, and scales are deeply embedded in thick skin (73-86 along the side lines), scales on both sides cover lots of ventral surfaces. Its caudal fin is relatively small, similar in shape to the dorsal fin, and extends from the dorsal fin to the caudal fin at the same level as the dorsal fin. The weight of the turbot is between 0.2 and 0.7 kilograms. Young turbot usually matures into large fish within 4‚Äì5 years, while female fish are larger than males, and the total age of a lifetime is about 15 years old.  * Distribution and habitat  Natural global range: NZ Turbot from New Zealand. = # New Zealand range = Turbot is a marine species that spreads throughout New Zealand and requires a seawater environment between 8.5 and 77 meters deep on New Zealand's coastline and shallow waters, but mainly on the South Island, such as the West Coast, south of the Cook Strait. = # Habitat preferences = Turbot is a marine species that spreads throughout New Zealand, but it is often found near the continental shelf in New Zealand. The habitat of the flounder is generally selected in shallow waters, bays., etc. It is rich in species on the west coast of the South Island and often appears in freshwater at a depth of about 30‚Äì90 meters. (McDowall, 1990). Young turbots gather in sheltered coastal waters such as estuaries, shoals and beaches, where they can survive for up to two years. Turbots also can be hidden by adjusting their body colors.  * Life cycle  Younger turbots may gather in sheltered coastal waters such as estuaries, shoals and bays where they can survive for up to two years. Young turbots usually grow rapidly in the first three years of growth, and then growth begins to slow down significantly. The growth of turbot for more than five years is the slowest in the entire cycle. After investigation, it was found that the translucent and opaque areas will gradually form in the 5-10-year-old turbine. However, the analysis of the edge of the turbot for more than 10 years is inconclusive. Turbots grow faster and faster than other halibut, and their females are much faster and faster than males. At the same time, turbot has multiple ovulation ability during the breeding season, and its mating period peaks mainly from October to February, and may reach tens of thousands of eggs. Some eggs may float on the surface of the sea and then hatch after a few days.  * Diet / Prey / Predators  = # Diet and foraging = Young turbots prefer small invertebrates and benthic animals, such as molluscs and shrimps, and large adult turbots will feed on smaller fish than other flounders. Like to prey during the day, the reaction speed is also very fast. It mainly feeds on fish and shellfish. Their mating period lasts for several months in the summer, and hundreds of females lay eggs. The number of reproductions in winter is significantly reduced. = # Predators and Diseases = Turbot is mainly harvested by seabirds and humans. Humans catch turbot to sell and eat. However, bacterial disease has become the most serious disease in turbot, such as Streptococcosis and Vibriosis. There is a high incidence of these diseases is in the summer or when the water temperature is low. Common symptoms are prominent eyeballs, then the eyes slowly become cloudy, and the body ulcerates and finally kills the host. References # Campbell, M.

It is located on U.S. Highway 80, east of Terrell and northeast of Kaufman, the county seat. The population was 768 at the 2010 Census. History Elmo's history begins in 1870 when the Texas and Pacific Railway laid track through the area. A community sprang up at the railhead, and it was decided that the new town be named to honor Elmo Scott, a T&P; Railroad surveyor. Elmo received a post office in 1873 and by the mid-1880s possessed several mills, five churches, its own schools and approximately 900 residents. Through the remainder of the 19th century, however, the population fell and by 1945 only 150 people called Elmo home. By 1990 this figure had fallen to 90; it remained at this level through to the 2000 Census.Robert Richard Butler, History of Kaufman County, Texas (M.A. thesis, University of Texas, 1940). Mabel Covington Keller, History of Kaufman County, Texas (M.A. thesis, North Texas State College, 1950). In 1892, Elmo residents adopted a resolution declaring a sundown town, prohibiting African Americans from living there and forcing existing black residents to leave.

His work has attempted to expand the definition and context of exhibition making. From 2003 to 2007 Hoffmann was director of exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Arts London. He is the former director of the CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Art from 2007 to 2016 and deputy director for exhibitions and programs at The Jewish Museum from 2012 to 2017, a role from which he was terminated following an investigation into sexual harassment allegations brought forth by staff members. Hoffmann has held several teaching positions including California College of the Arts, the Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti and Goldsmiths, University of London, as well as others.  Education and early theater work  Hoffmann trained as a theater director, studied stage directing and dramaturgy at the Ernst Busch Academy of Dramatic Arts in Berlin. He holds an M.A. from DasArts: School for Advanced Research in Theater and Dance Studies at the Amsterdam University of the Arts. His early work was interested in postdramatic theatre, not based on dramatic text. From 1993 to 1995 Hoffmann worked as an assistant dramaturg under Tom Stromberg at Theater At The Tower (also known as Theater Am Turm or TAT) in Frankfurt, where he worked on productions of such directors as Rene Pollesch, Stefan Pucher, Reza Abdoh, Needcompany, Michael Laub, Jan Fabre, Baktruppen, Gob Squad, and Heiner Goebbels. With Stromberg Hoffmann organized Theater Outlines, the performing- arts program of Documenta X in Kassel (1997).  Career  Hoffmann started his museum career as an intern at the Portikus Kunsthalle Frankfurt in 1995, followed by two years at the Dia Art Foundation in New York from 1995 until 1997. He worked at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum as an assistant curator from 1998 until 2000. From 2001 to 2002 Hoffmann worked as a curator at the Museum Kunst Palast, D√ºsseldorf.

Jones, Ousmane Semb√®ne, Tevfik Ba≈üer, Derek Jarman, Guy Debord, Konrad Wolf, and others. In 2012, together with Edoardo Bonaspetti, Andrea Lissoni, and Filipa Ramos, Hoffmann developed the ongoing Vdrome.org, an online platform offering screenings of films and videos directed by visual artists and filmmakers. In 2007 Hoffmann founded the Museum of Modern Art and Western Antiquities, for which he has curated two exhibitions: Section IV, Department of Light Recordings: Lens Drawings, Marian Goodman Gallery, Paris (2013), and Section III, Department of Pigments on Surface: Very Abstract and Hyper Figurative, Thomas Dane Gallery, London (2007). The next exhibition for the Museum of Modern Art and Western Antiquities will be Section II, Department of Carving and Modeling (2019). = People's Biennial = In 2009 he founded the People's Biennial with artist Harrell Fletcher. The People's Biennial explores and presents the creative activities of individuals and collectives as expressions of society's cultural diversity that would otherwise be overlooked, neglected, or even actively repressed. The first edition was organized in 2010 by Independent Curators International (ICI) and toured to five museums in the United States in 2011‚Äì2012: Portland Institute for Contemporary Art, Portland, Oregon; Dahl Art Center, Rapid City, South Dakota; Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art, Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Museum of Contemporary Art, Scottsdale, Arizona; and Cantor Fitzgerald Galleries, Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania. The People's Biennial 2014 took place at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. From 2011 to 2012 Hoffmann and Fletcher operated the one year long People's Gallery in San Francisco's Mission District, presenting solo exhibitions of six artists from the inaugural People's Biennial. = Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit = Between 2013 and 2016 he was senior curator at large, and from 2017-2018, he served as chief curator at large at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (MOCAD).

In the wake of that decision, the Honolulu Biennial cut its ties with Hoffmann, the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit suspended him from his role as chief curator at large (a position from which he resigned later that month) and the Kadist Art Foundation similarly suspended him from his position as curator and adviser. The 3rd People's Biennial was supposed to take place at the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art in 2019, with Hoffmann co-directing; however, the museum suspended its involvement with Hoffmann after the sexual harassment allegations at the Jewish Museum were not resolved. On December 17, 2017, the Jewish Museum terminated Hoffmann after a review of the allegations. Hoffmann denied \\"knowingly or purposefully [behaving] in a bullying, intimidating, harassing, or sexually inappropriate manner.\\"  Teaching  From 2003 to 2008 he served as adjunct faculty member in the curatorial studies program at Goldsmiths, University of London.

In 2000 Hoffmann was visiting professor at the department of Critical Writing and Curatorial Practice at Konstfack University College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm.  Books and publications  Hoffmann has written and edited over three dozen books and exhibition publications. = Select books = Among his book publications are:  A book publication of 12 issues of The Exhibitionist journal.   * = Select co-authored books =    = Journals and magazines = The Exhibitionist: A Journal on Exhibition Making was founded in 2009 by Hoffmann; the journal has advocated the author theory as developed specifically by Fran√ßois Truffaut in his 1954 essay \\"Une certaine tendance du cin√©ma fran√ßais\\" (\\"A certain tendency in French cinema\\") and adapted Truffaut's ideas to the sphere of exhibition making. Hoffman is the editor of The Exhibitionist. Hoffmann has been editor-at-large for Mousse magazine since 2011 and is a frequent contributor to Frieze and Artforum. He has written for Parkett, Texte zur Kunst, DOMUS, and Critique d'Arts, and was a columnist for Purple (magazine) from 2001 to 2003 as well as a correspondent for Flash Art from 2002 to 2007.

The University Athletic Association of the Philippines and National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) champions are considered to be the major champions, although several other leagues, claim their champions in equal standing with those of the UAAP and the NCAA. Furthermore, the NCAA and the UAAP were not members of the embattled Basketball Association of the Philippines, the then FIBA-recognized national basketball federation, although other leagues are members. Only in 2007 were the leagues included in the new national federation, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas. In 2008, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas sanctioned the Philippine Collegiate Champions League, a tournament originally known as the \\"Collegiate Championship League\\" (CCL) since 2002, as the country's collegiate men's national basketball champion. This league will work together with the different collegiate basketball leagues (UAAP, NCAA, etc.) in the implementation of this tournament.SBP launches the Philippine Collegiate Championship - March 12, 2008 Tournament formats Most collegiate leagues now have the same basic format, introduced by the UAAP with success on 1994 (but implemented on 1995), which has now been emulated by majority of the collegiate leagues with 8 members or less: *Double round eliminations *Top four advances to the semifinals *Top two seeds have the \\"twice-to-beat advantage,\\" wherein they only need to beat their opponents once while their adversaries needs to win twice (diagram A). *The finals are in a best of three series format. center *Ties are broken by holding an extra game or via points difference. If ties are broken by holding an extra game, it may have interesting implications: *For the #1 seed (diagram E), the winner may face a \\"weaker\\" opponent in the semifinals, although the loser will still have the twice to beat advantage. *For the #2 seed (diagram C), the competing teams will still face each other in the semifinals, thereby technically they're playing a best-of-3 series. *For the #3 seed (diagram D), the winner may face a \\"weaker\\" opponent in the semifinals, although they'll still have to win twice against their semifinal opponents in order for them to progress. Note that this is not played at all times, and leagues would rather use the points difference tiebreaker. *For the #4 seed (diagram B), it will be a knockout game, therefore the loser will be eliminated; the winner still has to win twice against their semifinal opponents in order for them to progress. *In most leagues, if a team sweeps the elimination round, the team will either be automatic champions, progress automatically to the finals (diagram F), or would have to go through the usual playoff format. If the sweeping team progresses to the finals, their opponents would either have to win twice consecutively (the twice to beat advantage, used in the NCAA) or a best of 3 series will be used (used in the UAAP). Breaking ties are also critical in when the swept team advances outright to the finals (diagram F): *For the #2 seed, the loser will have to go through a knockout game against the #4 seed, while the winner will have twice to beat advantage. *For the #4 seed, it is basically the same scenario when no team swept the eliminations, but the #4 team has to win 4 consecutive times against 3 different teams in order to advance to the finals. *The first-round knockout game and the semifinal stages is collectively known as the \\"stepladder series\\". *League champions do not face each other U.S. NCAA style to determine one national champion, although several off-season tournaments exist but these are not taken seriously by the schools. =Examples= *Diagram B: NCAA Season 80 seniors' playoffs - San Beda defeated Mapua for fourth and forced an extra game against UPHDS in the semifinals before being eliminated. *Diagram C: UAAP Season 67 men's playoffs - La Salle defeated Ateneo in the 2nd seed game to gain the twice-to-beat advantage; La Salle beat Ateneo again at the semifinals en route to the championship (although La Salle has forfeited their 2004 championship in 2006 after 2 players were found to have used fraudulent papers) *Diagram D: UAAP Season 69 men's playoffs - UST defeated Adamson to face #2 UE; Adamson was eliminated in the first game by #1 Ateneo, while #3 UST upset UE en route to the championship *Diagram E: UAAP Season 62 men's playoffs - La Salle defeated UST in the 1st seed game 84-79. Both La Salle and UST breezed through their semifinal opponents as La Salle held on to win the finals after 3 games. *Diagram F: UAAP Season 70 men's playoffs - UE's sweep in the eliminations gave them an outright finals berth, bypassing the semifinals where they've always been beaten since its inception. La Salle defeated Ateneo on the 2nd seed game, which defeated UST on the first round which had qualified by beating FEU on the 4th seed game. La Salle needed their twice to beat advantage to eliminate Ateneo in the semifinal.

He is best known as the creator of the famous PPSh-41 submachine gun, as well as working with Vasily Degtyaryov on the DShK heavy machine gun.  Early life  Shpagin was born in 1897 to a peasant family in Klyushnikovo close to Kovrovo, in what was then the Russian Empire. He attended school for three years, before becoming a carpenter at the age of 12 (in 1909). He was drafted into the Russian Army in 1916 to fight on the Eastern Front. He was assigned to repair artillery the following year.  Russian Revolution  After the October Revolution, he became a member of the Red Army, and worked as a gunsmith in Vladimir Oblast. After 1920, he worked in a workshop designing weapons in the same area, working with Vladimir Grigoryevich Fyodorov and Vasily Degtyaryov.  Creations  After a decade and a half of unsuccessful attempts, in 1938 his workshop released the DShK heavy machine gun. It is still in widespread use as an anti-personnel gun, an anti-aircraft gun, and a light anti-tank weapon. About 8,000 of them were made during the Second World War. In 1940, he came up with his most accredited design, the PPSh-41 sub-machine gun, which was the staple automatic weapon of the Red Army during the Second World War. It was cheap to produce and easy to maintain. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1944. He, in competition with the AS-44, also created his own prototype assault rifle called the ASh-44 which was blowback operated. It was dropped from the trial due to being uncontrollable on full auto and lead to the mandate that all future rifles be locked breech.  Post-war  Shpagin was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR from 1946 to 1950. He became seriously ill with stomach cancer, and died of it in early 1952.  Honours and awards  Shpagin was awarded the Stalin Prize, 2nd class, in 1941 and the title of Hero of Socialist Labour on 16 September 1945, for \\"creation of new types of weapons and raising the combat power of the Red Army\\". He received three Orders of Lenin during the war, in 1941, 1943 and 1945, in addition to the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class, in 1945 and the Order of the Red Star in 1938.

He was a genuine all-rounder, being both an attacking right-handed batsman and a formidable right arm fast bowler. Cricket writer John Woodcock ranked him as the fourth greatest cricketer of all time.John Woodcock's 100 greatest cricketers. Content- usa.cricinfo.com. Retrieved on 2018-05-23. Simon Wilde wrote of him: \\"The speed at which Mynn bowled... and his life-size personality captured the imagination of the public in a way no cricketer had before.\\"Simon Wilde, Number One: The World's Best Batsmen and Bowlers, Victor Gollancz, 1998, , p34. Mynn was born at Twisden, near Goudhurst in Kent, the fourth son of a gentleman farmer. He was a hop farmer, and was married to Sarah, in 1828. They had many children, five of his daughters survived to adulthood and Sarah Mynn outlived her husband by twenty years. He was a very large man by any standard, bearing comparison with W. G. Grace. He was well over six feet tall and weighed more than 21 stones (294 lbs). He was known as \\"the Lion of Kent\\"\\"Alfred Mynn\\" Cricinfo ‚Äì statistics and profile. and it was for Kent that most of his greatest feats occurred, though he also played a substantial number of matches for Sussex, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the All- England Eleven (AEE). His brother, Walter Mynn, was also an early cricketer with the Kent team.Walter Mynn. Cricketarchive Mynn's first-class career was from 1832 to 1859. He played in 213 first-class matches. As a batsman he had 395 innings. He scored 4,955 runs at a batting average of 13.42 runs per innings with a highest score of 125 not out. He made only one century, scored for South v North at Leicester in 1836. As a bowler he was fast with a round arm action. With his arm never getting above shoulder height he was obliged to bowl around the wicket. Fred Gale in \\"Echoes from old Cricket Fields\\" (Simpkin and Marshall 1871), wrote \\"I must see another man who stands six-foot two, of gigantic but symmetrical figure, standing up his full height, taking six stately steps to the wicket, and bringing his arm round well below the shoulder, and sending the ball down like a flash of lightning dead on the wicket, before I can ever believe there is or has been a greater cricketer than Alfred Mynn\\". Mynn suffered an ankle injury before the famous 1836 match. He batted with a runner and was unable to bowl. Leg guards had not yet been invented and as he made his hundred in the second innings his legs were badly bruised by the Northern fast bowler Sam Redgate. Mynn's captain, Lord Frederick Beauclerk sent him back to London laid out on the top of a stagecoach. Dr Bainbridge of St Martin's Lane and Surgeon Lawrence attended him at the Angel Tavern and debated whether his leg should be amputated. When told he would lose his leg at the hip, Mynn, a sincerely religious man, asked for a few minutes to say his prayers. In those minutes the doctors decided not to operate and instead had him sent to St Bartholomew's Hospital. After two years convalescence, he fully recovered.\\"Mynn's majestic innings ‚Äì and the birth of leg-guards\\", Cricinfo, 18 December 2004 After this injury there is some evidence that Mynn wore padding on his game leg. There is no conclusive evidence that he invented leg guards as worn by modern cricketers although there was an anecdote about WG Grace being presented with a pair of Mynn's pads and using them in a match. This story dates from Fred Gale's book \\"The Game of Cricket\\" (1887), published many years after the end of Mynn's career. Mynn's finances were never sound. He played as an amateur and a gentleman and risked social disgrace each time he accepted money for playing. He was imprisoned several times for debts owed to John Wyatt, a money lender, in 1845. He was made bankrupt in that year. Often he was saved from his creditors by wealthy patrons who wanted him free to play in a match they had an interest in. It is possible he had extensive medical bills to settle after the injury to his leg. The situation was eased in 1847, by the award of a testimonial match at Lord's between Kent and \\"England\\". Mynn was also an enthusiastic amateur actor, appearing for the Old Stagers during Canterbury Cricket Week. He took regular minor roles from 1847 until his death. He generally played strongmen such as Hercules. In 1853 the Kentish Gazette noted his appearance as \\"The Grand German Water Drinker\\" when he imbibed \\"no less than 12 tumblers of water in as many half minutes.\\" He died suddenly at his brother Walter's house at 22 Merrick Square, Newington near Southwark, London. The cause of death was diabetes. As a member of the Leeds and Hollingbourne Volunteers, a rifle corps which was a forerunner of the Territorial Army, he was entitled to a military funeral. He is buried in Thurnham churchyard next to two of his daughters. Legacy The village sign of Mynn at Bearsted William Jeffrey Prowse wrote what was to become one of the most famous pieces of cricket poetry in his memory. The first six stanzas compare Mynn with his contemporaries. The poem closes with these lines: :With his tall and stately presence, with his nobly moulded form, :His broad hand was ever open, his brave heart was ever warm; :All were proud of him, all loved him. As the changing seasons pass, :As our champion lies a-sleeping underneath the Kentish grass, :Proudly, sadly will we name him ‚Äì to forget him were a sin. :Lightly lie the turf upon thee, kind and manly Alfred Mynn!\\"Alfred Mynn ‚Äì the mighty man of rustic Kent\\", Cricinfo, 13 September 1963 Mynn is commemorated in Bearsted Kent, where the house in which he lived, Mount Pleasant, can be found. The village sign is a depiction of him, and the local pub, The Lion of Kent, is named after him. He is a fictional character in the historical novel Flashman's Lady. The main character Harry Flashman plays cricket with him several times.

Biography Harrison was educated at Dewsbury Technical College and School of Art. He was a foreman electrician and was active in the Electrical Trades Union. He served as a councillor on West Riding County Council and as an alderman of Castleford Borough Council. Elected Labour MP for Wakefield in 1964, Harrison served as a Government whip from 1966 to 1970 and as deputy Chief Whip from 1974 to 1979. On one occasion in 1968, Harrison was whipping on two bills simultaneously, trapping his leg in the door of a division lobby on the second vote; famously ruling that most of Harrison's body was in the lobby, the chairman of the bill committee declared the vote passed 22¬æ‚Äì22 in Labour's favour. In the Conservative landslide at the 1983 general election, he held his seat - which had undergone substantial boundary changes - with a majority of only 360 votes over the Conservative candidate. Harrison retired from parliament in 1987. He died on 19 October 2012, aged 91. Role in 1979 vote of no confidence On 28 March 1979, Harrison played a critical role in the defeat of the Labour government in the vote of confidence. As the vote loomed, Harrison approached Conservative MP Bernard Weatherill to enforce the convention and \\"gentlemen's agreement\\" that if a sick MP from the Government could not vote, an MP from the Opposition would abstain to compensate. The Labour MP Sir Alfred Broughton was on his deathbed and could not vote, meaning the Government would probably lose by one vote. Weatherill said that the convention had never been intended for Matter of Confidence and it would be impossible to find a Conservative MP who would agree to abstain. However, after a moment's reflection, he offered that he himself would abstain, because he felt it would be dishonourable to break his word with Harrison. Harrison was so impressed by Weatherill's offer ‚Äì which would have effectively ended his political career ‚Äì that he released Weatherill from his obligation and so the Government fell by one vote on the agreement of gentlemen.The Night the Government Fell, BBC archive on the 1979 vote of confidence, audio interview of Weatherill and Harrison This episode was dramatised in James Graham's 2012 play This House (which opened one month before Harrison's death). When the play was first performed at the National Theatre, the part of Harrison was played by Philip Glenister.

It falls within the Coedffranc West ward. Jersey Marine is centered on a main road formed by Ashleigh Terrace, coming from a junction with the A483 road (Fabian Way), which curves to the east along New Road leading to Llandarcy. The A483, Fabian Way, is normally considered the gateway into Swansea City Centre, therefore it is mistakenly thought that the area is part of the city of Swansea despite the village being part of Neath Port Talbot. The local primary school in the village is Crymlyn Primary School. Secondary school age children attend school in Neath, not Swansea. The village includes the Pant y Sais Nature Reserve, a fen area featuring a circular boardwalk which connects with the tow path of the Tennant Canal. A new distribution centre for Amazon.co.uk is sited south of the village on the site of a former cable manufacturing plant. It opened on 16 April 2008. Jersey Marine tower Jersey Marine is most famous to locals for its tower. This is a four-storey octagonal tower that was built in the Victorian era. The tower was designed to provide a panoramic view of the surrounding area through its camera obscura. It was built as part of the development of Jersey Marine as a holiday resort. Having fallen into disrepair, there were proposals to restore the camera obscura but it was eventually fully restored in 2006 as part of The Towers Hotel and is now used as a bridal suite. Jersey Marine beach Jersey Marine beach stretches from the River Neath estuary to Swansea Docks. It is backed by sand dunes at Crymlyn Burrows to the north. To the northeast lies the golf course of the Swansea Bay Golf Club. Heavy industrial sites are prominent to the eastern and western ends of the beach. Visitors should be aware of the dangers of this beach, which have been the cause of many deaths in the past. Firstly, the tide goes out extremely far, which can lead people to walk out to get close to the water's edge. Unbeknown to many, there are a number of large sand banks across the beach. When the tide comes in, it comes in widely around these sandbanks. Anyone facing the water would not know that it is cutting them off from behind. The extremely strong currents in this water makes it a recipe for disaster.

In many countries across Europe (and increasingly beyond), it has a long- standing tradition as a field of practice and academic discipline concerned with addressing social inequality and facilitating social change by nurturing learning, well-being and connection both at an individual and community level. The term 'pedagogy' originates from the Greek pais (child) and agein (to bring up, or lead), with the prefix 'social' emphasising that upbringing is not only the responsibility of parents but a shared responsibility of society. Social pedagogy has therefore evolved in somewhat different ways in different countries and reflects cultural and societal norms, attitudes and notions of education and upbringing, of the relationship between the individual and society, and of social welfare provision for its marginalised members. Social pedagogues (professionals who have completed a qualification in social pedagogy) work within a range of different settings, from early years through adulthood to working with disadvantaged adult groups as well as older people. To achieve a holistic perspective within each of these settings, social pedagogy draws together theories and concepts from related disciplines such as sociology, psychology, education, philosophy, medical sciences, and social work. Methods  H√§m√§l√§inen points out that social pedagogy is not a method or a set of methods, but that any method is chosen based on social pedagogical considerations. In the past 3 main methods were defined: # Individual case work ‚Äì with the aim to improve/develop individual life circumstances, # Social group work ‚Äì with the aim of developing social competences, # Community intervention work ‚Äì with the aim to develop social demographic structures. After 1970 a lot of different methods derived from those three. In practice a mono-methodical approach can be barely found; approaches/ concepts of action predominate which include more than the three classic methods.  Principles  Social pedagogy is based on humanistic values stressing human dignity, mutual respect, trust, unconditional appreciation, and equality, to mention but a few. It is underpinned by a fundamental concept of children, young people and adults as equal human beings with rich and extraordinary potential and considers them competent, resourceful and active agents.

Maidenhead: Open University Press. identify 9 principles underpinning social pedagogy: * \\"A focus on the child as a whole person, and support for the child‚Äôs overall development; * The practitioner seeing herself/himself as a person, in relationship with the child or young person; * Children and staff are seen as inhabiting the same life space, not as existing in separate hierarchical domains; * As professionals, pedagogues are encouraged constantly to reflect on their practice and to apply both theoretical understandings and self-knowledge to the sometimes challenging demands with which they are confronted; * Pedagogues are also practical, so their training prepares them to share in many aspects of children‚Äôs daily lives and activities; * Children‚Äôs associative life is seen as an important resource: workers should foster and make use of the group; * Pedagogy builds on an understanding of children‚Äôs rights that is not limited to procedural matters or legislated requirements; * There is an emphasis on team work and on valuing the contribution of others in 'bringing up' children: other professionals, members of the local community and, especially, parents. * The centrality of relationship and, allied to this, the importance of listening and communicating.\\" Eichsteller & HolthoffThemPra (2008). Social Pedagogy Training Resource Pack. Unpublished material. suggest that social pedagogy aims to achieve: * Holistic education ‚Äì education of head (cognitive knowledge), heart (emotional and spiritual learning), and hands (practical and physical skills); * Holistic well-being ‚Äì strengthening health-sustaining factors and providing support for people to enjoy a long-lasting feeling of happiness; * To enable children, young people as well as adults to empower themselves and be self-responsible persons who take responsibility for their society; * To promote human welfare and prevent or ease social problems. They go on to describe social pedagogical practice as a holistic process creating a balance between: * the professional: (theory and concepts, reflective practitioner ‚Äì the ‚Äòhead‚Äô) * the personal: (using one's personality, positive attitude, building personal relationships, but keeping the ‚Äòprivate‚Äô out ‚Äì the ‚Äòheart‚Äô) * the practical: (using certain methods and creative activities ‚Äì the ‚Äòhands‚Äô) All three elements are equal and complement each other, thus generating synergy.  Historic development  Although pedagogy varies across European countries, there are similar roots that have developed into differing strands of contemporary thinking in pedagogy. H√§m√§l√§inenH√§m√§l√§inen, J. (2003). The Concept of Social Pedagogy in the Field of Social Work. Journal of Social Work, 3(1), 69‚Äì80. explains that ‚Äúhistorically, social pedagogy is based on the belief that you can decisively influence social circumstances through education‚Äù ‚Äì and importantly, education is seen as a lifelong learning process that does not only refer to children but includes educating adults, for instance in order to change their idea of children. While philosophers of Classical antiquity like Plato and Aristotle discussed how education could contribute to social development, social pedagogy in theory and practice only emerged through the influence of modern thinking in the Renaissance, the Reformation and later during the Enlightenment, when children started to come into the picture of social philosophy.Summary of: Eichsteller, G. (2009). A Journey through the History of Social Pedagogy. Keynote speech presented at the Youth & Policy Conference ‚ÄòHistory of Youth & Community Work‚Äô, University of Durham. = Jean-Jacques Rousseau = A major impetus for the current understanding of pedagogy was the educational philosophy of the Swiss social thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712‚Äì1778). Concerned with the decay of society, he developed his theories based on his belief that human beings were inherently good as they were closest to nature when born, but society and its institutions corrupted them and denaturalized them. Consequently, bringing up children in harmony with nature and its laws so as to preserve the good was central for Rousseau's pedagogic theory. Rousseau innovatively ‚Äúargued that the momentum for learning was provided by the growth of the person (nature) ‚Äì and that what the educator needed to do was to facilitate opportunities for learning,‚Äù as Doyle and SmithDoyle, M. E., & Smith, M. K. (1997). Jean-Jacques Rousseau on education. The Encyclopaedia of Informal Education. note. = Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi = Rousseau's educational philosophy inspired ensuing pedagogues, notably Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746‚Äì1827), who refined Rousseau's thoughts by developing a method of holistic education, which addressed head, heart, and hands. These three elements are inseparable from each other in Pestalozzi's method and need to be kept in harmony. \\"Nature forms the child as an indivisible whole, as a vital organic unity with many sided moral, mental, and physical capacities. Each of these capacities is developed through and by means of the others,\\" Pestalozzi stated. = New Education Movement = Pestalozzi's ideas sparked interest across continental Europe, and particularly the New Education Movement transferred his pedagogic concept into various settings, such as kindergarten (Fr√∂bel), school (Montessori, Steiner, Hahn), residential care (Korczak), and informal work with children and young people (Montessori). Thus the New Education Movement contributed to a continental pedagogic discourse, which saw children being conceptualised as equal human beings (\\"Children do not become humans, they already are\\", Korczak), and as competent, active agents (\\"A child has a hundred languages\\", Malaguzzi). Furthermore, there was increasing recognition for child participation and children's rights, for instance in the pedagogic concepts of Montessori and Korczak. The New Education Movement led to a spread of pedagogic concepts and ideas across many European countries and made two fundamental points which demonstrate its ambition to use pedagogy for social change: ‚ÄúFirst, in all education the personality of the child is an essential concern; second, education must make for human betterment, that is for a New Era‚Äù.Boyd, W., & Rawson, W. (1965). The Story of the New Education. London: Heinemann. = Alleviating poverty = Based on the educational ideas of Rousseau, Pestalozzi and Fr√∂bel, the German headteacher Friedrich Diesterweg (1790‚Äî1866) emphasised the social relevance of pedagogy in fighting social inequalities. For him social pedagogy was \\"educational action by which one aims to help the poor in society\\".cited in Cannan, C., Berry, L. & Lyons, K. (1992). Social Work and Europe. London: Macmillan. Through the contribution of Diesterweg and other thinkers, such as Friedrich Schleiermacher, pedagogy took on a more social role, one of community education that also occurs in later writers like Paulo Freire and John Dewey.Smith, M. K. (2009). Social Pedagogy. The Online Encyclopaedia of Informal Education. Although pedagogy was early on concerned with changing social conditions through education ‚Äì Rousseau is most famous for his Social Contract (1762) ‚Äì its primary focus had been on the individual and his or her upbringing, which Rousseau had aimed to protect from the negative influences of society. Pedagogic thinkers like Pestalozzi and later on Montessori followed in his tradition of developing a child-centred pedagogy, which was increasingly criticised by an emerging school of thought that promoted a pedagogy focused on the collective, on the community and how to use pedagogic ideas for social betterment ‚Äì or a social pedagogy, as the German educationalist Karl Mager had written in 1844 for the first time. = Social pedagogy = One of the first key thinkers, Paul Natorp, ‚Äúclaimed that all pedagogy should be social, that is, that in the philosophy of education the interaction of educational processes and society must be taken into consideration‚Äù,. His social pedagogic theories were influenced by Plato‚Äôs doctrine of ideas, together with Immanuel Kant‚Äôs categorical imperative of treating people as subjects in their own rights instead of treating them as means to an end, and Pestalozzi‚Äôs method. In the 1920s, with influential educationalists such as Herman Nohl, German social pedagogy was interpreted from a hermeneutical perspective, which acknowledged that an individual‚Äôs life and their problems can only be understood through their eyes and in their social context, by understanding how the individual interacts with their social environment. Following World War II and the experiences within National Socialism that exposed the dangers of collective education in the hands of a totalitarian state, social pedagogy ‚Äúbecame more critical, revealing a critical attitude towards society and taking the structural factors of society that produce social suffering into consideration‚Äù. Consequently, contemporary social pedagogy in Germany is as a discipline linked more closely to social work and sociology than to psychology. Due to different historical developments and cultural notions, social pedagogy has very different traditions in other countries, although these are connected through the overarching core principles of social pedagogy. And even within one country, there is not the pedagogic approach ‚Äì within the general discipline pedagogy we can distinguish various approaches. Some of these are named after key thinkers like Fr√∂bel or Montessori who have created a very specific pedagogic concept for the context of their work, while others are termed according to the medium they are utilising, such as adventure, play, circus, music, or theatre pedagogy.  Qualifying as a social pedagogue  Similar to other academic disciplines, social pedagogy is a degree-level qualification (higher education) of usually 3.5 years. There are different education routes to qualify as a social pedagogue, which vary from country to country: = Germany = In Germany social pedagogy and social work have merged into one course ‚Äì ‚ÄòSoziale Arbeit‚Äô- since 2007 graduates holding after successful study a double degree: Social Worker and Social Pedagogy. Social Pedagogy can be studied at Fachhochschule (Universities of applied Sciences) and universities, social pedagogy is offered as Bachelor of Arts (3.5 years) with 1 semester of practical placement as part of the curriculum- Graduates will have the ability to place their professional activity in legal and socio- political perspective and analyse it. The interplay of work experience in their placement and theoretical work in the university prepares the graduates to work with clients, in the field of administration and management of social organisations. For a deeper more research based study Social Pedagogy can be studied after the Bachelor as Master of Arts (2 years). Social Pedagogy is multidisciplinary ‚Äì the study includes: * Psychology * Sociology * Pedagogy / Education Theory * Social Work * Social Management * Law and Politics * Professional Concepts such as Mediation, Therapy, Supervision, communication concepts. * Media * Economy * Social Justice * Health * Theatre pedagogy = Denmark = Danish social pedagogues usually qualify at Seminariets (seminariums), which offer 3.5 year courses that include 3 placements in different pedagogic settings throughout the period of studies. Some seminariums also offer short courses on social pedagogy in English. Further studies at MA level often combine social pedagogy with interlinked disciplines, such as social work, sociology or psychology, and can be pursued at several universities. = Czech Republic and Slovakia= Czech and also Slovak social pedagogues usually study at the university level (there is also possibility to study at the college where they will get a DiS. degree). Social Pedagogy is offered as a Bachelor study programme. For research based studies, Social Pedagogy can be studied as Master programme after finishing the bachelor's degree. The academics separate Social Pedagogy from the social work and they look at them as at two separate disciplines. In Slovakia is Social pedagogy a part of professional network in Educational and psychological centres (as part of school facilities) and also in schools. = North America = In the United States, Arizona State University's School of Social Transformation offers a master of arts degree in social and cultural pedagogy. The 30-unit program requires 10 three-credit courses. The core courses (9 credits) include Foundations of Social Transformation, Research Methods, and Social and Cultural Pedagogy: Theoretical and Practical Issues. Students complete five elective courses (15 credits) and then either a thesis or a capstone project (6 credits). The program develops students' capacity to analyze non-formal education policies and practices and examine the educational impact of a range of institutions, organizations and associational spaces. It provides training and skills for work in settings such as: adult education, community organizing, literacy programs, museum education, dis/ability programs, youth and sports programs, peace education, environmental education, religious organizations, health education, civic education, Indigenous and tribal communities, for-the-job and on-the-job training. =United Kingdom= A variety of qualifications are now available in the UK, ranging from a Level 3 qualification to BA programmes to a master's degree. Since February 2017 the Social Pedagogy Professional Association has acted as a professional home for social pedagogy in the UK. As a membership organisation it has developed social pedagogy standards of proficiency and standards for education and training.

In other words, : \\\\delta^i{}_j = g^{ik}g_{kj} and thus : n = \\\\delta^i{}_i = g^i{}_i = g^{ij}g_{ij} is the dimension of the manifold. Christoffel symbols satisfy the symmetry relations :\\\\Gamma_{kij} = \\\\Gamma_{kji} or, respectively, \\\\Gamma^i{}_{jk}=\\\\Gamma^i{}_{kj}, the second of which is equivalent to the torsion-freeness of the Levi-Civita connection. The contracting relations on the Christoffel symbols are given by :\\\\Gamma^i{}_{ki}=\\\\frac{1}{2} g^{im}\\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{im}}{\\\\partial x^k}=\\\\frac{1}{2g} \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial x^k} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\log \\\\sqrt{g}}{\\\\partial x^k} and :g^{k\\\\ell}\\\\Gamma^i{}_{k\\\\ell}=\\\\frac{-1}{\\\\sqrt{g}} \\\\;\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{g}\\\\,g^{ik}\\\\right)} {\\\\partial x^k} where gis the absolute value of the determinant of the metric tensor g_{ik}.

Gradient, divergence, Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator The gradient of a function \\\\phi is obtained by raising the index of the differential \\\\partial_i\\\\phi dx^i, whose components are given by: : abla^i \\\\phi=\\\\phi^{;i}=g^{ik}\\\\phi_{;k}=g^{ik}\\\\phi_{,k}=g^{ik}\\\\partial_k \\\\phi=g^{ik}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x^k} The divergence of a vector field with components V^m is : abla_m V^m = \\\\frac{\\\\partial V^m}{\\\\partial x^m} + V^k \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\log \\\\sqrt{g}}{\\\\partial x^k} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{g}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial (V^m\\\\sqrt{g})}{\\\\partial x^m}. The Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator acting on a function f is given by the divergence of the gradient: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta f &= abla_i abla^i f = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{g}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial x^j}\\\\left(g^{jk}\\\\sqrt{g}\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x^k}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= g^{jk}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial x^j \\\\partial x^k} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial g^{jk}}{\\\\partial x^j} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x^k} + \\\\frac12 g^{jk}g^{il}\\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{il}}{\\\\partial x^j}\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x^k} = g^{jk}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial x^j \\\\partial x^k} - g^{jk}\\\\Gamma^l{}_{jk}\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x^l} \\\\end{align} The divergence of an antisymmetric tensor field of type (2,0) simplifies to : abla_k A^{ik}= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{g}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial (A^{ik}\\\\sqrt{g})}{\\\\partial x^k}.

Kulkarni‚ÄìNomizu product The Kulkarni‚ÄìNomizu product is an important tool for constructing new tensors from existing tensors on a Riemannian manifold. Let A and B be symmetric covariant 2-tensors. In coordinates, :A_{ij} = A_{ji} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad B_{ij} = B_{ji} Then we can multiply these in a sense to get a new covariant 4-tensor, which is often denoted A {~\\\\wedge\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\bigcirc~} B. The defining formula is \\\\left(A {~\\\\wedge\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\bigcirc~} B\\\\right)_{ijkl} = A_{ik}B_{jl} + A_{jl}B_{ik} - A_{il}B_{jk} - A_{jk}B_{il} Clearly, the product satisfies :A {~\\\\wedge\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\bigcirc~} B = B {~\\\\wedge\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\bigcirc~} A In an inertial frame An orthonormal inertial frame is a coordinate chart such that, at the origin, one has the relations g_{ij}=\\\\delta_{ij} and \\\\Gamma^i{}_{jk}=0 (but these may not hold at other points in the frame). These coordinates are also called normal coordinates. In such a frame, the expression for several operators is simpler. Note that the formulae given below are valid at the origin of the frame only. :R_{ik\\\\ell m}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2g_{im}}{\\\\partial x^k \\\\partial x^\\\\ell} \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2g_{k\\\\ell}}{\\\\partial x^i \\\\partial x^m}  \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2g_{i\\\\ell}}{\\\\partial x^k \\\\partial x^m}  \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2g_{km}}{\\\\partial x^i \\\\partial x^\\\\ell} \\\\right) :R^\\\\ell{}_{ijk}= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^j} \\\\Gamma^\\\\ell{}_{ik}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^k}\\\\Gamma^\\\\ell{}_{ij} Conformal change \\\\widetilde{g}=e^{2\\\\varphi}g Let g be a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemanniann metric on a smooth manifold M, and \\\\varphi a smooth real- valued function on M.

The play looks at issues of alienation, hostility and social pressure in high schools and was suggested by the April 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Jefferson County, Colorado. The play premiered in Silver Spring, Maryland in 2005 and then Off-Broadway in 2006. Plot columbinus includes excerpts from discussions with parents, survivors and community leaders in Littleton as well as diaries and home video footage to reveal what it refers to as \\"the dark recesses of American adolescence\\". The first act of the play is set in a stereotypical, fictional American high school and follows the lives and struggles of eight teenage archetypes. These characters are not given names but labels, and the two outcast friends designated in the script as \\"Freak\\" and \\"Loner\\" are slowly driven to crime and madness by the bullying from their classmates. In the first scene of act two, these boys become Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold when the actors playing Freak and Loner, respectively, approach two tables with objects relating to the massacre and change into replicas of the clothing the perpetrators wore; the perpetrators' senior photos are projected on a screen behind them. The scenes following this are taken from the perpetrators' videos and personal journals, illustrating the days approaching and including the shootings and the suspects' suicides. The newly added act three has the other cast members become survivors and townspeople who reflect on the events, including the cover up of information surrounding the suspects. The play briefly touches on modern shootings such as the incidents at Aurora or Newtown. A few productions have included a brief scene discussing the story of the Columbine survivor who wrote to Mike Judge about \\"Wings of the Dope,\\" an episode of King of the Hill which she credited with enabling her to grieve a boy she never got to tell she loved, who turned out to be one of the perpetrators (resulting in her being pressured to repress her grief). Characters *Loner- Geek in the school who is picked on by his peers and neglected by his parents. Has a romantic fascination with Rebel, who views him as \\"not her first choice. Maybe not anyone's.\\" In the Second Act, embodies Dylan Klebold. *Freak- An underdog with a chip on his shoulder and a chest deformity. He is ridiculed by his classmates, with the exception of AP, whom he detests. His father is an ex-military general who is overly hard on him. In the Second Act, embodies Eric Harris. *AP (Advanced Placement)- The play's representation of pure kindness and good-heartedness. He is extremely intelligent, but fantasizes about having good looks, popularity, and athletic ability, which he can never have due to a life-threatening illness. He reaches out to the other students, and is a secret friend to most of them. He is the only character who the killers set free at the shootings. *Rebel- Artistic and rough-talking teenager who finds a sort of kinship with Loner. She thinks AP is nice, but that he is too pure-hearted and a \\"loser\\" for her taste. She denies rumors that she is goth or a druggie, but is seen making cuts into her arm in the First Act. *Faith- Has a passion for Biblical studies, which is often her downfall when trying to make friends. Is briefly the object of Freak's affection. She is well-liked by many people, but her virginal way of thinking is often made fun of. *Perfect- The most popular girl in school, though many people find her to be snobby and fake. It appears that she has no problems with her life at all. However, it is revealed that her mother is a school bus driver, and is struggling to make ends meet. Perfect also reveals that she is pregnant. *Prep- Standard school bully, who is popular because of who his friends are. He has an unreturned romantic interest in Jock. *Jock- Popular and amiable school hero. He is athletic, popular, and extremely attractive. As a hard-working student in school, he finds it irritating that the terms \\"Brainless\\" and \\"Jock\\" are so often put together.

Critical response When columbinus premiered in 2005 at the Round House Theatre, Peter Marks of The Washington Post called it \\"An ambitious examination of the suburbanization of evil, directed with a surefire sense of theatricality by PJ Paparelli.\\" Marks noted that \\"The script, by a writing team headed by Paparelli... is heavily based on research. (Stephen Karam and Sean McNall are credited as co- writers.) The words of Harris and Klebold, as well as court records, statements of Columbine witnesses and interviews with high school students across the country are incorporated into the proceedings.

Here, scribes Karam and Paparelli drop the universal material of teen angst garnered from interviews in favor of words drawn from the private diaries, emails and videotapes that go a long way in exploring the twisted thinking behind the shootings... the production is especially well served by the wall of sound created by Martin Desjardins to suggest the demonic thoughts ricocheting in the boys' brains as they bought guns, made bombs, dressed to kill and worked themselves into a homicidal frame of mind by obsessing on their grievances as social outcasts.\\"Stasio, Marilyn. \\"Review.

His career in football was intimately connected to Sparta Rotterdam, in which he began as a professional footballer, going on to manage the side in several categories and capacities, but he also played with success in Belgium for Anderlecht. Van Tiggelen appeared nearly 60 times for the Netherlands, representing the nation at the 1990 World Cup and two European Championships, being a starter in the team that won Euro 1988. Club career Born in Oud-Beijerland, South Holland, Van Tiggelen ‚Äì nicknamed \\"De Spijker\\" (nail) ‚Äì started his professional career with Sparta Rotterdam, making his Eredivisie debut on 30 August 1978, in a 1‚Äì0 home in against neighbours Feyenoord. During his five-year spell at the club, he was an undisputed starter, also finding the net every season (for a total of 13 league goals). In 1983, Van Tiggelen signed with fellow league side FC Groningen and remained there for three years, managing to again maintain top level status in every season. Afterwards, he had his first abroad experience, as he joined R.S.C. Anderlecht in neighbouring Belgium, where he also appeared regularly (as first-choice). Aged 34, Van Tiggelen returned to his own country, moving to PSV Eindhoven. The veteran marker still managed to collect nearly 100 official appearances, playing 26 games as the side won the 1991‚Äì92 national championship. He saw out his career at 38, after one season ‚Äì and again in the top division ‚Äì with Dordrecht'90; his last game ended 5‚Äì1, at home against FC Volendam. Van Tiggelen then returned to his first club, mainly serving as assistant manager and youth trainer. In 2005, he had his first head coach experience, and finished the season in the second position, helping Sparta return to the first division. The second spell as head manager ‚Äì still with Sparta ‚Äì occurred in late 2007, following the dismissal of Gert Aandewiel. Subsequently, Van Tiggelen was part of Foeke Booy's coaching staff. International career Van Tiggelen earned 56 caps for the Netherlands national football team, going scoreless in the process. His debut came at age 26, as he appeared in a friendly with Belgium on 21 September 1983 (1‚Äì1). From 1986 onwards, Van Tiggelen was an automatic first-choice in the national team's setup: he played in every match and minute at UEFA Euro 1988, which the Netherlands won, and also represented the nation at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and Euro 1992, retiring from international play following the side's elimination against eventual winners Denmark in the latter competition; he was aged 35, and formed in previous years an efficient fullback partnership with Berry van Aerle (also his club mate from 1991‚Äì94).

In 1979, Anionwu became the United Kingdom's first sickle-cell and thalassemia nurse specialist, helping establish the Brent Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Counselling centre with Consultant Haematologist Dr Milica Brozovic. In 1998, by then a Professor of Nursing, Anionwu created the Mary Seacole Centre for Nursing Practice at the University of West London. She holds a PhD, was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and is a Fellow of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). She retired in 2007, and in 2016 she published her memoirs, Mixed Blessings from a Cambridge Union. Early life Elizabeth Nneka Anionwu was born Elizabeth Mary Furlong in Birmingham, England, to an Irish mother and a Nigerian father. Her mother, Mary Maureen Furlong, was in her second year studying Classics at Newnham College, Cambridge University. Her father, Lawrence Odiatu Victor Anionwu, was studying Law at Cambridge University. Her upbringing had been heavily affected by moving between institutions and family. She spent just over two years living with her mother, a relationship that ended when her stepfather, who did not accept her and drank heavily, started to physically abuse her. For much of her childhood, she was cared for by nuns, including several years in the Nazareth House convent in Birmingham. Often harshly punished and humiliated for wetting the bed, she remembers being made to stand with a urine-soaked sheet over her head as a punishment for wetting the bed. In the book she recalls, that later in life when working as a health visitor, \\"I made sure to keep up-to-date with more humane treatments for bedwetting\\". Nonetheless, she grieved leaving the convent to go and live with her mother. Every period of relative stability in childhood ended in sudden collapse. Following an unsettled childhood she qualified as a nurse, then health visitor. Shortly before her 25th birthday she suddenly found her father: barrister and former Nigerian Ambassador to Italy and the Vatican, Lawrence Odiatu Victor Anionwu. She was to visit Nigeria frequently and later changed her surname to Anionwu. Family Anionwu has credited her father, Lawrence Anionwu, a barrister and diplomat, as the first person to provide her with career advice. Anionwu has one child, her daughter Azuka Oforka, an actress (in the BBC One medical drama series Casualty). Career Anionwu began her nursing career at a young age after being inspired by a nun who cared for her eczema. At the age of 16, she left school with seven O-levels and started to work as a school nurse assistant in Wolverhampton. Later on, she continued with her education to become a nurse, health visitor, and tutor. She travelled to the United States to study counselling for sickle-cell and thalassemia centres as courses were not then available in the UK. In 1979 she worked with Dr Milica Brozovic to create the first UK sickle-cell and thalassemia counselling centre in Brent. The opening of this counselling centre pioneered the opening of more than 30 centres in the UK using the Brent Centre as a model. In 1990 at the Institute of Child Health, University College London, she was a lecturer and then later was promoted to being a senior lecturer. With the help of Professor Marcus Pembrey, Anionwu taught a course at University College London that was for National Health Service (NHS) staff members who worked with communities affected or at risk of sickle-cell disease, cystic fibrosis, Tay‚ÄìSachs disease and thalassaemia. Plaque of the ward named after Mary Seacole in Whittington Hospital in north London. Anionwu was appointed Dean of the School of Adult Nursing Studies and a Professor of Nursing at University of West London. Here she created the Mary Seacole Centre for Nursing Practice at the University of West London until her retirement in 2007. In 2001, Anionwu, along with Professor Atkin, wrote the book The Politics of Sickle Cell and Thalassemia. In 2005, she wrote a book, A Short History of Mary Seacole. In 2003 she became a Trustee and subsequently Vice- Chairperson of the Mary Seacole Memorial Statue Appeal. Following the unveiling of the statue at St Thomas' Hospital in June 2016 she was appointed a Life Patron of the Mary Seacole Trust. Anionwu is also a Patron of other charities: * Sickle Cell Society * Nigerian Nurses Charitable Association UK * Vice President of Unite/Community Practitioners and Health Visitors Association * Honorary Advisor to England's Chief Nursing Officer's Black & Minority Ethnic Strategic Advisory Group Publications Throughout the course of her career, Anionwu has published many pieces of work. In 2016, she published a memoir called Mixed Blessing from a Cambridge Union (). Anionwu has published works related to her field of work and study in many journals. She has written informative pamphlets for family members of sickle-cell patients, nurses who care for sickle-cell patients, and information for the general population. =Selected writings= * 1977: \\"Self Help in Sickle Cell Anaemia\\".

It is documented in the late 14th century. The family is usually divided in several lineages as it continued through female succession. Please observe that no one surnamed Kurki who lived in Finland after the 17th century is descended from this family through documentarily proven agnatic lineage. The surname is common in Finland, and has been used by several other former or current unrelated families. The medieval Kurki family held the manor of Laukko at least since the 14th century, until the beginning of the 19th century. A seal of a member of this family is known already from the early 15th century. It depicts a common crane, which is kurki in Finnish. However, the coat of arms of the family since the 15th century depicts a sword with three stars (lady Elin's coat of arms, and later confirmed in the 1st baron's coat of arms at the Swedish House of Nobility when the baronial rank was obtained in 1652). In 1797, Arvid Fredrik Kurck (1735‚Äì1810) was created a Swedish count, but his branch became extinct. Original Kurki family of Tavastia According to folklore, an ancestor of the family Kurki was Matthew Kurki, a legendary chieftain of Pirkka men of the 13th century. Legendary material assign him as the first owner of Laukko. However, before the confiscation of ecclesiastical properties in the 16th century, kings and government did not have lands to grant to speak of, and therefore this idea, having received it from king as reward, in the folklore derives from more modern era. In Middle Ages, people owned usually just inherited lands and lands conquered or assarted by the clan. Landed properties were highly family- committed. Laukko seems not to have been an immense landholding until made gradually such by the second Kurki family in the 15th century. The location of the Matthew (Matti) Kurki folklore as itself matches, because Laukko is located in Vesilahti, the historical Pirkkala area, where those folk legends are strongest. There is a gap of a century between Matti Kurki and the first documented Kurki, deputy lawspeaker Jakob Kurki (Jeppe, Jesper, Jaakko, Jacob) of the late 14th century, whose seat was the manor of Niemenp√§√§ in southern Tavastia. Medieval Kurki family The heiress of the old Kurki family of Niemenp√§√§ married sometime in the late 14th century a nobleman named Herman, of either Swedish or German extraction and using the nickname Sv√§rd, \\"sword\\", in accordance with his coat of arms. Of their sons, Nicholas used the nickname Kurki, whereas another son, Peter, seems to have been known as \\"sword\\" (\\"..old lord Peder Sw√§rdh..\\"). From Peter, owner of Niemenp√§√§, the continuous line holding the lordship of Harviala descends. Nicholas is surmised to have been childless, but from a younger kinsman of his (researchers have estimated that as nephew, be it nephew through a brother or, more probably, a sister) Jeppe, a further family using the name Kurki descends. This Jeppe Kurki (Jacob, Jaakko, Jesper) married Karin Klasdotter, daughter of Klas Lydekesson, an important heiress. The last male of their line was a grandson, Arvid Kurk (1463‚Äì1522), who was the last catholic bishop of Turku. Bishop Arvid Klasson Kurk had a sister, Elin Kurk, who was married with Knut Eriksson (Canute Ericsson), lawspeaker of Northern Finland. Elin's son J√∂ns Knutsson (1503-c 1577) inherited his uncle the bishop Arvid and was the next owner of Laukko and the Kurki patrimony. This epoch also includes (at least in folklore): Klas Kurk, of the 15th century. He was a nobleman who in the folk ballad Death of Elin burned his (first) wife Elin, whom he believed to have been unfaithful and given birth to a son of another man. The poem however is either fictive or possibly persons are mixed. Noble, ultimately baronial family Kurki, in Sweden known as Kurck Elin Klasdotter, sister of bishop Arvid Kurk, and heiress of the medieval Kurki family, is the ancestress of the next male-line family that used the surname Kurki. The Swedish formulation of the name ‚Äì Kurck ‚Äì was manifested as the family was registered under that name in 1625 at the Swedish House of Nobility when that institution was established. Lady Elin's father was lord Klas Jeppesson Kurk. Her husband was lawspeaker Knut Eriksson (died in 1539 at great age), a member of the Privy Council of Sweden and since 1511 lagman of Northern Finland (Elgenstierna gives him as a scion of the Sm√•landic family of petty gentry holding the manor of N√§s; but Gillingstam opines him being of Finnic extraction). Elin's son J√∂ns Knutsson Kurck (1503-c 1577) was also member of the royal council (PC) and his father's successor as lawspeaker. The family continues through a son of J√∂ns' second marriage with Ingeborg Tott: * Canute J√∂nsson (died 1598). His wife was Bridget Benedictsdotter of the Gylta family, who inherited the Hedens√∂ manor in N√§shulta, S√∂dermanland. That manor became the Kurki family's seat in Sweden. Colonel Axel Kurck 1555‚Äì1630 was a soldier whom revolting Cudgel men (nuijamiehet) wanted to make their chief, but he did not consent. Axel became later military governor of the entire Finland. J√∂ns Kurck (1590‚Äì1652), member of the Royal Council and president of Court of Appeals of Turku, was created friherre (baron) in 1652, and he started the baronial family that survived to the 20th century. The baronial Kurck family held the Laukko manor yet over a century, but settled chiefly in Sweden in the area of Stockholm, because they were of high nobility and often among the important officials of the kingdom. The unmarried baron Axel Gustav Kurck (1728‚Äì1800) established Laukko as a fideicommiss for agnates of the Kurck family. Arvid Fredrik Kurck (1735‚Äì1810) was in 1797 created count but did not bother to register it at the Swedish House of Nobility. He succeeded in 1800 as owner of Laukko fideicommiss. His distant cousin and successor, baron Klas Arvid Kurck (1769‚Äì1834), Lord Justice of the Supreme Court of Sweden, and Lord President of the Chamber Court of Sweden (the supreme administrative court), had to sell (ultimately in 1817) the ancestral manor of Laukko when Finland had become a separate grand duchy attached to Russian Empire, because the Kurck family wanted to stay in Sweden, and the Finnish government did not allow foreigners to possess landed properties. Baron Klaus Arvid's only son's only son, Dr. Phil, baron Klas Karl Gustav Kurck (1849‚Äì1937), cultural historian, was the last legitimate agnate of this Kurck family. Female-line descendants of the baronial lineage live, mostly in Sweden, including branches of families von Friesendorff, Stjernsw√§rd, Wrede, von Nolcken, and Procop√©.  Royal descendants  The current king of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Willem-Alexander (born 1967), Prince of Orange, descends paternally, through a female line, after 500 years, from each of the three above-mentioned Finnish families of Kurck. This is because one ancestress of Willem-Alexander has been countess Eva Horn (1653‚Äì1740), wife of Reichsgraf Nicholas Bielke, lord of the Finnish barony of Korpo, and daughter of the Finnish field marshal Gustav Horn (1592‚Äì1657), Count of Pori, the Lord High Constable of Sweden. The Horn counts of Pori, Finland descend, through the Porvoo-originated owners of the manor of Syd√§nmaa, from a daughter of the abovementioned lady Elin Klasdotter, heiress of the Kurck of Laukko, and her husband lawspeaker Knut Eriksson. Lady Elin, as explained above, descended from the medieval Kurck of Laukko family and from the Kurck of Niemenp√§√§ family (and was their heiress), and of course all her descendants so descend too.

Background The family name had come to the United Kingdom when Philip William Casimir van Straubenzee, a Belgian captain in the Dutch Blue Guards, came with Bonnie Prince Charlie to support the Jacobite rising of 1745. As the Jacobite army headed south into England, he met Jane Turner of Kirkleatham. Sir William Turner, who was Lord Mayor of London in 1669, was born in Kirkleatham. In his will, he had bequeathed a substantial amount of money to his great nephew, Jane's father Cholmley Turner, a member of parliament for Yorkshire, 1727‚Äì1741. With marriage blocked by Cholmley Turner, Philip and Jane were forced to elope to marry. Becoming a member of the British Army, due to his later loyalty to the British Crown, Philip was naturalized as a British citizen by Act of Parliament in 1759 at the request of George II. Early life William van Straubenzee was the only son of Brigadier Arthur Bowen van Straubenzee DSO MC (the eighth generation of the family to serve in the military), and his wife Margaret Joan Radcliffe. He had a sister, Vivien Isabel Ruth van Straubenzee (1934-2016). Van Straubenzee was educated at Westminster School, where under the influence of his friend Anthony Wedgwood Benn he became a youthful socialist. Military career Van Straubenzee's family had a noted military background (eight generations to his father), and Van Straubenzee himself served in his father's regiment, the Royal Artillery (1942‚Äì47), including two years in the Far East at staff level. He left the military in 1947 with the rank of Major. Professional career Van Straubenzee became a solicitor in 1952, and later a partner in a law firm. Political career Van Straubenzee later commented that World War II had \\"matured\\" his politics, and he became active in the Conservative Party. Chairman of the London branch of the Young Conservatives from 1949, he became chairman of the Young Conservatives from 1951 until 1953, when he became a governor of the conservative Ashridge think tank. He was awarded an MBE for political services in 1954.The Times, 10 June 1954, \\"Official Appointments and Notices\\", p5 =Westminster= Van Straubenzee unsuccessfully contested Clapham in 1955, after which he was elected to serve as a councillor of Richmond Borough Council 1955‚Äì58. He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Wokingham from 1959 to 1987, when he retired and was succeeded by John Redwood. David Eccles appointed him as his Parliamentary Private Secretary from 1960 to 1962. In opposition from 1964, he served as spokesman on labour and social services, and then as an education spokesman where his views were heavily influenced by Sir Edward Boyle. Van Straubenzee served in Edward Heath's government as junior higher education minister for Education and Science from 1970 to 1972, under Secretary of State Margaret Thatcher. He was promoted to Northern Ireland minister from 1972 to 1974, where he fully engaged the Roman Catholic community and often angered the Ulster Unionist Party. However, after joining Heath's shadow cabinet in March 1974 as shadow Education Secretary, his avowed support of comprehensive school education brought him into conflict with Norman St John Stevas. The political fight was won by Thatcher and Stevas, who replaced him as Educational spokesperson, whilst Van Straubenzee was moved by Heath to become shadow Defence spokesperson. With his political career blunted, especially after Thatcher replaced Heath as leader in 1975 and sacked him from the shadow cabinet, van Straubenzee focused on his work with the Church of England and backbench efforts. As a \\"One Nation\\" conservative and noted \\"wet\\" amongst the Conservative party, his complimentary flat in Lollard's tower of Lambeth Palace became the meeting place for the \\"wet\\" dissident Conservative grouping, \\"The Lollards\\". Van Straubenzee chaired the Conservative backbench Education Committee from 1979 until he stepped down, and was personally recommended for a Knighthood by Thatcher in 1981. In government documents released in July 2015, van Straubenzee was named in connection to child sexual abuse, but the context of the reference is not known. Church of England Van Straubenzee was a member of the House of Laity from 1965 to 1970, and was elected to the General Synod of the Church of England in 1975 serving until 1985. He chaired the Synod's Dioceses Commission from 1978 to 1986, and was appointed by Margaret Thatcher to be the Second Church Estates Commissioner in 1979 (dealing with Anglican Church matters in the House of Commons), a post he held until he stood down in 1987. A progressive within the Anglican and CoE, Van Straubenzee opposed Lord Cranborne's private bill in 1981, designed to allow congregations to continue to use the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, over the recently introduced Alternative Service Book. During the period in which relations between CoE bishops and the Conservative Government declined, he clashed publicly with the chairman of the Conservative party John Selwyn Gummer (then also a member of the General Synod), over Gummer's open criticisms of the episcopal bench. In 1992 after stepping down from the House of Commons, he chaired a Synod inquiry which recommended that the Prime Minister should lose his right to advise the Queen on senior Church appointments, and that vacancies for bishoprics should be advertised. The recommendation and most of the report was quickly dismissed by senior members of the episcopate. Personal life Van Straubenzee never married.

Cottingley falls within Beeston and Holbeck ward of the Leeds City Council, and is classed as an area of Beeston. The area includes Cottingley Hall Cemetery and Crematorium, run by the Council. Etymology The etymology of Cottingley is uncertain, because the name may be an ancient one, deriving from Old English, or a more recent one. The name is reliably recorded as a Leeds place-name only from 1538. If the name was given only in the fifteenth or sixteenth century, it was probably named after someone with the surname Cottingley (which in this case would originally have referred to Cottingley, Bradford, which is already attested in the Domesday Book of 1086). However, there is a record of a place called Cottingle from 1226 which may refer to the Leeds Cottingley rather than the Bradford one. If the Leeds name is indeed this old, it probably does derive independently from the same Old English words as its Bradford counterpart. If so, the first element is the personal name Cotta (the origin of which is unknown), and the second the suffix -ingas denoting a group of associated people. Thus the Cottingas were a group descended from or otherwise associated with someone called Cotta. This group name was then compounded with the Old English word lƒìah ('open land in a wood'). Thus the name once meant 'the clearing of the descendants of Cola'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Name Society, 2017), 39. Cottingley Hall Estate Most of Cottingley is a council estate. The Cottingley Hall estate was built in the 1970s, replacing an estate of temporary prefabricated housing that had previously been on the site. The estate was built on 'New Town Principles' (similar to Bransholme in Kingston upon Hull), the estate is set around a series of cul de sacs, segregating large volumes of traffic from housing and pedestrians. This method of building has often been criticised as creating a 'rabbit warren', impractical for the local police. Although on larger estates of similar style this causes a problem, the effects on Cottingley have been minimal. The two tower blocks (Cottingley Towers and Cottingley Heights) situated on a hill at the centre of the estate were at the time Leeds's tallest flats. They were built in 1972 and refurbished in 1989. Amenities Cottingley railway station Cottingley railway station serves the area. It is situated on the Leeds to Huddersfield line and was opened in 1988. The Church in Cottingley is a Methodist one, part of a building which is also a community centre. The local school is Cottingley Primary Academy. Adjacent to the cemetery is Junction 1 Retail Park which includes a B&Q; warehouse, a Burger King, a B&M; store, The Food Warehouse and A Paw Prints pet shop which all three opened in 2019. The Aldi supermarket and Maplins closed down in June 2018. There is a small precinct on the estate, this did have a pub, the Cottingley Arms but this has been closed a number of years. There are a small number of shops in the precinct. The White Rose Shopping Centre is a short walk away.

It is known for the Cottingley Fairies, which appeared in a series of photographs taken there during the early 20th century. Etymology The village is first mentioned in the Domesday Book as Cotingelai in the wapentake of Skyrack and the lands of Erneis of Buron. The first element is the personal name Cotta (the origin of which is unknown), and the second the suffix -ingas denoting a group of associated people. Thus the Cottingas were a group descended from or otherwise associated with someone called Cotta. This group name was then compounded with the Old English word lƒìah ('open land in a wood'). Thus the name once meant 'the clearing of the descendants of Cola'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place- Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Name Society, 2017), 39. History The village was clustered around the original St Michaels Church, town hall and the Sun Inn. This village was from Bingley, with Cottingley Bridge a mile closer. In 1917, two girls, 15-year old Elsie Wright and nine-year old Frances Griffiths, claimed to have photographed fairies in the dell (Cottingley Beck) at the bottom of their garden. This led to the Cottingley Fairies hoax, which still resonates in the village into the modern day. The village has a festival to celebrate the story (Cottingley Fairy Fest), and in 1997, parts of a film inspired by the story, FairyTale: A True Story, were filmed in the village. Governance Cottingley is part of Bingley Rural Ward on Bradford City Council and part of the Parliamentary constituency of Shipley, represented since 2005 by the Conservative Philip Davies. At the 2011 Census, Bingley Rural Ward, which includes Cullingworth, Denholme, Harden and Wilsden, had a population of 17,895. Geography Fairies signpost in Cottingley The village is in the Aire Valley between Shipley and Bingley approximately above sea level with the River Aire to the north. The road through the village has been changed at least twice. Originally, to exit south from Bingley, travellers had to cross Ireland Bridge then Beckfoot Bridge and approach Cottingley on the south side of the river. The bridge across the River Aire leading towards Bingley was built by 1649, when it appears in the Book of Bridges in the Session Rolls of Wakefield. It was recorded in 1664 that \\"a great floode hath taken away the foundations so that the whole bridge is shrunke.\\" Cottingley Bridge was rebuilt and in the early 19th century, it was a hamlet independent of Cottingley. The A650 road is now to the north of Cottingley after a bypass was built and opened in 2003. The land to the east of the B6269 is mainly flat and to the west rises to a height of at March Cote Farm. Cottingley beck cuts a deep, narrow, rocky channel flowing north to the River Aire. Although the road, railway and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal are on the opposite side of the Aire Valley to Cottingley, Parliament was asked to consider making the Aire Navigable from Cottingley to Shipley. The village lies on Millstone Grit and there are coal deposits, some bands and seams up to thick. Old mine shafts litter the fields either side of Cottingley Cliffe Road shown as either Old Coal Pits or Coal pits on the 1852 map, and one is listed as Cottingley Moor Bottom as having closed in 1860. Amenities There are two churches in the village; St Mary and St Monica is the Catholic church and the Church of St Michael and All Angels is the Anglican Church. St Michaels and All Angels was part of a regeneration project that spent ¬£4.5 million, which included meeting rooms, a doctor's surgery, nursery and youth facilities and 50 new homes. The project started because a 1960s war memorial had been vandalised, and reports in the press caught the eye of Prince Charles, who came to speak at the grand unveiling. The village has a primary school on Cottingley Moor Road, rated Good by OFSTED, and a secondary school, Dixons Cottingley Academy. Cottingley has a town hall, now grade II listed, which celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2015. The town hall was used for religious services until the first St Michael and All Angels church was built in the 1870s.

Speculations of the child's parentage involve either Lucrezia Borgia with her alleged lover, Perotto Calderon or Cesare Borgia, or Pope Alexander VI as his father. Cesare Borgia's biographer Rafael Sabatini says that the truth is fairly clear: Alexander fathered the child with an unknown Roman woman. Pope Alexander VI issued two papal bulls, both dated 1 September 1501, in each of which a different father is assigned to Giovanni Borgia. The second bull appears to supplement and correct the first. The first of these Bulls, addressed to \\"Dilecto Filio Nobili Joanni de Borgia, Infanti Romano\\", declares Giovanni Borgia to be a child of three years of age, the illegitimate son of Cesare Borgia, unmarried (as Cesare was at the time of the child's birth), and of a woman (unnamed), also unmarried. The second declares Giovanni Borgia instead to be the son of Pope Alexander VI himself and runs: \\"Since you bear this deficiency not from the said duke, but from us and the said woman, which we for good reasons did not desire to express in the preceding writing\\". The pope was forbidden by canon law to publicly recognize children and did not wish that Giovanni Borgia should suffer in his inheritance as a consequence. Giovanni Borgia appeared as a companion of Lucrezia Borgia, who named him as her younger half-brother. Pope Alexander VI, in two bulls excommunicating members of the Savelli and Colonna families and confiscating their properties, was able to name Giovanni Borgia as heir to the duchy of Nepi, a property important to the Borgia family. Giovanni Borgia was also named duke of Palestrina on 17 September 1501. Giovanni Borgia was passed from guardian to guardian, eventually ending up with Lucrezia Borgia in Ferrara. Giovanni Borgia held several other titles, including the signory of Vetralla. He served as a minor functionary in the Papal Curia and at the court of France. He had three daughters. Popular culture Hella Haasse constructed a historical novel around the figure of Giovanni Borgia, The Scarlet City (1952). In the historical fiction of the Assassin's Creed video game series universe, Giovanni Borgia is depicted as the love child of the star-crossed union between Lucrezia Borgia and Perotto Calderon, a courier who was secretly a member of the Assassins. In the 2011 television series The Borgias, Giovanni is portrayed as the son of Lucrezia (portrayed by Holliday Grainger) and a young groom named Paolo, who is then murdered by her brother Juan, Duke of Gandia.

Aubier-Montaigne, 1968)  Early life  La Roque was born on 6 October 1885 in Lorient, Brittany, the third son of a family from Haute-Auvergne. His parents were General Raymond de La Rocque, commander of the artillery defending the Lorient Naval Base, and Anne Sollier. He entered Saint Cyr Military Academy in 1905, in a class known as \\"Promotion la Derni√®re du Vieux Bahut\\", and graduated in 1907. He was posted to Algeria and the edge of the Sahara, and in 1912 to Lun√©ville. The next year, he was called to Morocco by General Hubert Lyautey. Despite the outbreak of the First World War, La Roque remained there until 1916 as officer of native affairs, when he was gravely wounded and repatriated to France. Meanwhile, his older brother Raymond, a major in the army, had been killed in action during 1915. Despite this, La Roque volunteered to fight on the Western Front and was sent to the trenches of the Somme to command a battalion. After the war he was assigned to the Inter-allied staff of Marshal Ferdinand Foch, but in 1921, he went to Poland with the French Military Mission under General Maxime Weygand. In 1925, he was made chief of the 2nd Bureau during Marshal Philippe P√©tain's campaign against Abd el-Krim. He resigned from the army in 1927 as a lieutenant colonel.  The Croix de Feu and the February 6, 1934, crisis  Fran√ßois de La Rocque came from the patriotic and social Catholic movement created by Lamennais at the end of the 19th century. He then joined the Croix de Feu in 1929, two years after it was formed, and took them over in 1930. He quickly transformed the veterans' league, creating a paramilitary organization (les dispos, short for disponibles - availables) and formed a youth organization, the Sons and Daughters of the Croix de Feu (les fils et filles de Croix de Feu). He also accepted anybody who accepted the league's ideology, in the Volontaires nationaux group (National Volunteers). Due to the crisis, La Rocque added to the nationalist ideology a social program of defense of the national economy against foreign competition, protection of the French workforce, lower taxes, fighting speculation, and criticisms of the state's influence on the economy. All in all, this was a vague program, and La Rocque stopped short of giving it a clearly anti-republican and fascist aspect as some National Volunteers demanded of him. La Rocque concentrated on organizing military parades, and was very proud of having taken over the Interior Ministry by two Croix de Feu columns on the eve of the February 6, 1934 riots. The Croix de Feu took part in these far right demonstrations, with two groups, one on Bourgogne street, the other near the Petit Palais, were to converge on the Palais Bourbon, seat of the National Assembly. But colonel de La Rocque ordered the disbandment of the demonstration around 8:45 p.m., when the others far-right leagues started rioting on Place de la Concorde in front of the Palais Bourbon. Only lieutenant-colonel de Puymaigre, a member of the Croix de Feu and also a Parisian municipal counsellor, unsuccessfully tried to force the police barrage. After these riots, the French far right and parts of the right wing criticised him for not having attempted to overthrow the Republic. Journalist Alexander Werth argues: :At that time the Croix de Feu, the Royalists, the Solidarit√© and the Jeunesses Patriotes had no more than a few thousand active members between them, and that they would have been incapable of a real armed uprising. What they reckoned on was the support of the Paris public as a whole; and the most that they could reasonably have aimed at was the resignation of the Daladier Government. When this happened, on February 7, Colonel de la Rocque announced that 'the first objective had been attained.' Alexander Werth and D. W. Brogan, The Twilight of France, 1933-1940 (1942) p 16 online  The Parti Social Fran√ßais and the Second World War In June 1936 the Croix-de-Feu, along with all other French far-right leagues, was dissolved by the Popular Front government, and La Rocque then formed the Parti Social Fran√ßais or PSF (1936), which lasted until the German invasion of 1940. Until 1940, the PSF took a more and more moderate position, being the first French right-wing mass party, with 600,000 to 800,000 members between 1936 and 1940. Its programme was nationalist, but not openly fascist. On the contrary, French historians Pierre Milza and Ren√© R√©mond consider that the success of the moderate, Christian social and democratic PSF prevented the French middle class from falling into fascism.John Bingham, \\"Defining French fascism, finding fascists in France\\" in Canadian Journal of History 29.3 (1994): 525-544. Milza wrote: \\"Populist and nationalist, the PSF is more anti- parliamentarian than anti-republican\\", and he reserved the term \\"fascism\\" for Jacques Doriot's Parti populaire fran√ßais (PPF), insisting on the latter party's anti-communism as an important trait of this new form of fascism.Pierre Milza, La France des ann√©es 30, Armand Colin, 1988, p.132 However, this characterisation of the PSF has been questioned: for example Robert Soucy has argued that the differences between the PSF and fascist movements in Italy and Germany were more superficial than their similarities, and that La Rocque was \\"a dyed-in-the-wool fascist\\". After the Battle of France of 1940, La Rocque accepted \\"without restrictions\\" the terms of the June 1940 Armistice and reorganized the PSF which became the Progr√®s Social Fran√ßais (French Social Progress). La Rocque also accepted the \\"principle of Collaboration\\", upheld by Marshal Philippe P√©tain in December 1940. However, at the same time, he was attacked by sectors of the far right, who claimed he had founded his newspaper with funds from a \\"Jewish consortium\\". His attitude remained ambiguous, as he wrote an article in Le Petit Journal of October 5, 1940, concerning \\"The Jewish Question in Metropolitan France and North Africa\\" (La question juive en m√©tropole et en Afrique du Nord).Biography of Fran√ßois de La ROCQUE An American journalist wrote in 1941 that the Petit Journal with La Rocque as editor \\"assumed a more courageously anti-German attitude after the armistice than did most other papers published under the control of the Vichy government.\\" La Rocque approved the repeal of the Cr√©mieux decrees which had given French citizenship to Jews in Algeria but did not follow the Vichy regime in its racist radicalization. He also condemned the ultra- collaborationist Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism. La Rocque changed orientation in September 1942, declaring that \\"Collaboration was incompatible with Occupation\\" and entered into contact with the R√©seau Alibi tied to the British Intelligence service. He then formed the R√©seau Klan Resistance network with some members of the PSF. La Rocque rejected the laws on the STO that forced young Frenchmen to work in Germany, and also threatened to expel any member of the PSF who joined Joseph Darnand's Milice or the LVF. He was arrested in Clermont-Ferrand on March 9, 1943, by the SIPO-SD German police along with 152 high ranking PSF members in Paris allegedly because he had been trying to convince P√©tain to go to North Africa. He was deported first to , nowadays in the Czech Republic; then to Itter Castle, Austria, where he found former president of the Council √âdouard Daladier and generals Maurice Gamelin and Maxime Weygand. Sick, he was interned in March 1945 in a hospital in Innsbruck and was freed by US soldiers on May 8, 1945. He returned to France on May 9, 1945 and was placed under administrative internment, allegedly to keep him away from political negotiations, especially from the Conseil national de la R√©sistance (CNR, the Resistance unified organization). After being released, he was put under house arrest and died on April 28, 1946.  Political heritage  The Parti Social Fran√ßais (PSF) of Fran√ßois de La Rocque has been described as the first right-wing mass party in France (1936‚Äì1940). He advocated: * a presidential regime to end the instability of the parliamentary regime. * an economic system founded upon \\"organised professions\\" (corporatism). * social legislation inspired by Social Christianity. Several historians consider that he paved the way to two leading parties of the post-war \\"republican Right\\", the Christian democratic Popular Republican Movement (MRP) and the Gaullist Union of Democrats for the Republic.

Thus, the opponent likely ends up blaming himself for not taking advantage of the opportunity presented, even though to do so would have been irrational. The benefit of the Grosvenor gambit is supposed to come on future hands, due to a loss of concentration by the player who was taken in by the gambit. The gambit was named after Philip Grosvenor, a fictional character in a short story by Frederick B. Turner published in The Bridge World,June 1973, Volume 44, Number 9 who first discovered the gambit accidentally, and over time developed its theory and deployed it deliberately. The story depicts Grosvenor as often frustrated by opponents who are too obtuse to fall for his ruse. Grosvenor's lifeless body is eventually found bludgeoned to death, his fingers broken, shortly after a bridge tournament in which he used his gambit against the wrong opponents. A subsequent article by Kit Woolsey in The Bridge World, titled The Grosvenor Gamble,July 1978, Volume 49, Number 10 extends the original idea, farcically expounded in the 1973 story, to possible at-the-table applications. Example The following deal provides an opportunity for a Grosvenor coup by West: Against South's 3NT West leads A and continues with K and two more winning hearts. South wins the spade continuation, and has to run the diamonds without losing any further tricks. He therefore plans to play the A and next to unblock by playing the J to the K, hoping for a 2-2 split or a singleton Q (this is the percentage play with the given holding). On the actual layout, South cannot succeed. See, however, what happens when West drops the 10 under the A. Declarer now has the opportunity to make his contract by next letting the J run. This play, however, is utterly illogical: it can gain only when West has started with Q-10-6, but with that holding West would \\"never\\" play the 10 first. So, South plays for a 2-2 holding in diamonds and on the second diamond trick overtakes the J with the K, only to see East show out. South will regret not having finessed, and - per Grosvenor's theory - will be furious with himself for not taking the illogical play, for not guessing that West would misplay from Q 10 6. Worse yet, North may blame declarer for not having made the impossible play of letting the J ride. East-West are expected to reap even more benefit on the following boards, due to the emotional storm that West has stirred up for North-South. In his 1973 article,The Grosvenor gambit Turner describes various other examples, including one in which a Grosvenor gambit is successfully deployed by declarer.

Distribution and habitat Betta persephone has a limited distribution in Malaysia, the type locality being Ayer Hitam in Johor. This Betta species inhabits soft, acidic waters at temperatures of 23‚Äí28 ¬∞C (73‚Äí82 ¬∞F). The typical habitat is closed-canopy forest where it is dark on the forest floor and there is thick vegetation on the banks of the blackwater streams and peat swamps where this fish lives among submerged tree roots. Sometimes it may be forced to live temporarily among the wet leaf litter in periods when the peaty pools dry up. Ecology In its natural habitat, Betta persephone feeds on insects and other small invertebrates. It is a bubble nester, creating a ball of bubbles among submerged vegetation in which to lay its eggs.

It is about 45 km from Kuala Lumpur and 800 m above sea level. The village was estimated to have a population of around 2,820 in 2019. The village was first settled by three Bentong villagers in 1930 who moved when the city was flooded in 1926. More villagers settled in Janda Baik afterwards, and the village was frequently visited by the Sultan of Pahang. Although the village originally only focused on the agricultural industry, Janda Baik also focuses on the electronics and tourism industries today. History =Foundation and etymology= Villagers of Janda Baik in 1933. Haji Yasir (in black suit) are one of the three founders of Kampung Tiga Haji, the previous name for Janda Baik. Before Janda Baik was founded in 1930, the area was primarily inhabited by Orang Asli tribes. The village was founded when some residents moved from Bentong to an area with a higher elevation due to the 1926 floods that affected Bentong and other low elevation areas. The earliest founder for this village are Haji Deris, Haji Kadir, and Haji Yasir, who built a hut and stayed in the area for almost a week before others start populated the area. The village was originally given the name Kampung Tiga Haji to refer to the three early settlers. The rising numbers of population in Janda Baik caught the attention of Abu Bakar of Pahang, the Sultan of Pahang, who made his first visit to the village in 1932. The Sultan stated that he did not recognize this name and requested the village to be renamed. An argument between the Orang Asli chief Tok Batin Wok and his wife Siah caused both to separate for a month before they reconciled. Four weeks later after their reconciliation, Bentong district officer Henry Peacock suggested that the name should be renamed to Janda Baik, as baik in Malay refers to the relationship between Orang Asli chief Tok Batin Wok and his wife Siah, which improved since they reunited. As such, the village was officially renamed to Janda Baik on 19 September 1936. Another reason Janda Baik was chosen as the village name is that a widow had helped treat the injured Pahang army returning to their base in Pahang when they fought in the civil war in Selangor. She offered medicine to treat the injured people. Because of this, the village was given the name Janda Baik to honor her kindness, where janda and baik respectively mean \\"widow\\" and \\"good\\" in the Malay language. In the village, there used to be an island called Pulau Santap that was located in the middle of the big stream that ran through it. It was used by the Sultan of Pahang as resting place; the word santap refers to eating in Malay language. The island eroded due to development in the area. =Post-independence= Janda Baik entrance arch in October 2020 Janda Baik started to become popular after the late Tan Sri Muhammad Ghazali Shafie, the former Foreign Affairs Minister of Malaysia, survived the Cessna 206 air crash on January 11, 1982, in Janda Baik when he was going to Kuala Lipis to attend a UMNO division committee meeting. The Malaysian government feared that a Federal Government's Minister may have been captured by communist guerillas due to his participation in fights against the Japanese Red Army from 1973 to 1981. He survived with light injuries while the co-pilot (Vergis Chacko) and his bodyguard (Charon Daan) were killed in the crash. As Kuala Lumpur became more crowded and congested, a proposal was made to build a new administrative center known as Putrajaya, where the administrative buildings and offices would be relocated to. In 1990, the government listed six possible places to build Putrajaya, one of which was in Janda Baik. They decided to build it in Perang Besar, Selangor. In August 2019, villagers protested further development of ecotourism in this area that were silently implemented by authorities without the residents' consent. They claimed that ecotourism development would erode cultural and traditional values, and disrupt the villagers' daily lives. The residents demanded that the authorities should focus on improving the road conditions and cleaning the river instead. Economy Elektrisola electronics factory Most early residents made their living in agriculture through small rubber plantations and paddy (oryza sativa) cultivation mainly because Janda Baik has a rich natural network of rivers.Harold, p. 36 - 37 In addition, farmers also plant bananas on paddy fields. However, due to lack of maintenance on the paddy fields, the yields declined rapidly and the fields were invaded by Imperata cylindrica.Harold, p. 37 About 55% of the residents surveyed identified as farmers in 2001.Harold, p. 38 In recent years, some people moved from urban areas to Janda Baik to set up farming businesses, experience a cooler climate, or escape from an urban livelihood. Urban farmers sold their vegetables to customers and restaurants in Janda Baik. Fig plantations became a tourist attraction in Janda Baik. The electronics industry in Janda Baik started when Elektrisola, a German-based electronics corporation, opened its factory in 1990. It focused on manufacturing copper wires and litz wires to support the rapidly growing Asian market and economy, and created 1,000 jobs for villagers and nearby inhabitants. 90% of the products produced are exported to Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Sports and recreation In recent years, Janda Baik has become a popular spot for cyclists and trail runners. The town has become popular among cyclists who perceive it as an ideal place for cycling due to its route's hill terrain were perceived as challenging, in addition to scenic views, little traffic, cold climate and a cuisine haven. The village is also popular for trail running due to its hilly slopes, and also has a swimming pool, paintball and ATV driving. References Further reading * Harold, Brookfield (2001).

According to the UNEP there are only about 1,000 wild Asian elephants left on the Malay peninsula.\\"The Asian (Indian) Elephant\\" United Nations Environment Programme (2004) The rapid development phase in Malaysia has effects on the elephants. Unused land and forest became a much sought after commodity. As agricultural development rapidly encroached into these areas, the elephants' natural and ancestral foraging ground shrunk smaller and smaller. Consequently, some of these elephants began to forage in new farm areas and plantations. An effort by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks was the setting up of an elephant translocation unit in 1974 to track down, capture and then release these elephants into larger and safer forest reserves throughout the Peninsula.

From the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Rompin is located east and is about 3¬Ω hours journey by road.  History  Marlin statue in Rompin. It was said at one time in this area there is a tree named Ru, or Rhu (Casuarina equisetifolia). Ru trees are unique compared with other casuarina trees that live here because of its cascading shape. One story tells of rhu trees having a circumference that can fit as many as 40 people dining together. At first, people call this place name as Rhu Ramping, and eventually Rumpin and Rompin. In colonial days, Kuala Rompin was a fishing village that is often visited by traders who commute between Singapore and Kuantan. In 1952 the Pahang state government made Rompin an autonomous sub-district under Pekan. An Administrative Officer was subsequently appointed, taking the post of Assistant District Officer, to be stationed in the autonomous subdistrict; British officer, J.B. Melford was appointed to that post on 16 December 1952. On July 31, 1976, the Sultan of Pahang, His Majesty Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al Musta'in Billah upgraded Rompin into a full district, hence separating it from Pekan and making Rompin the ninth district of Pahang. Rompin was given one vote in the parliament one decade later. Today, Rompin District is divided into five mukims (communes), namely Tioman, Endau, Pontian, Keratong and Kuala Rompin town. Attractions Kuala Rompin is probably best known as the gateway to Tioman Island. However, it is not without its own attractions. The restaurants of Kuala Rompin are famous for their seafood, especially for their freshwater prawns and freshwater clam caught in the surrounding areas especially at the estuary of Sungai Rompin (Rompin River). Crabs and squids are also popular. Kuala Rompin is also building a name for itself in the sport of sailfish fishing. It is increasingly being recognized as the Sailfish Capital of Asia, and hosts a yearly world-class fishing event, the Royal Pahang International Billfish Challenge. Kuala Rompin is considered to be one of the best places in the world to catch Sailfish.

(The term \\"extremally disconnected\\" is correct, even though the word \\"extremally\\" does not appear in most dictionaries.\\"extremally\\" in the O.E.D. The term extremely disconnected is sometimes used, but it is incorrect.) An extremally disconnected space that is also compact and Hausdorff is sometimes called a Stonean space. This is different from a Stone space, which is usually a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space. In the duality between Stone spaces and Boolean algebras, the Stonean spaces correspond to the complete Boolean algebras. An extremally disconnected first-countable collectionwise Hausdorff space must be discrete. In particular, for metric spaces, the property of being extremally disconnected (the closure of every open set is open) is equivalent to the property of being discrete (every set is open). Examples * Every discrete space is extremally disconnected. * The Stone‚Äìƒåech compactification of a discrete space is extremally disconnected. * The spectrum of an abelian von Neumann algebra is extremally disconnected. * Any commutative AW*-algebra is isomorphic to C(X) where X is extremally disconnected, compact and Hausdorff. * Any set with the cofinite topology is extremally disconnected, but if the set is infinite this space is connected.

It is situated in the most scenic site of Genting Highlands, on a 28-acre plot of rocky forested land donated by Genting Group founder the late Lim Goh Tong. Located 4,600 feet above sea level, the temple is about 5‚Äì10 minutes' drive down from the peak of the mountain. Within the temple is seated a statue of Qingshui, a Buddhist monk who has long been referred to as a deity in Fujian Province, China for his supernatural abilities to summon rain and drive away evil spirits. The temple attracts many local and foreign devotees from Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, China, Thailand and Indonesia.  History  Genting Highlands Resort. After completing the building of Genting Highlands Resort in 1975, which at that time was just a hotel with a small casino, Lim Goh Tong began construction of the temple. With the same dedication that he demonstrated in developing the Genting Highlands Resort, the late Lim began by gathering a group of friends many of whom were from his own Anxi clan and ancestry village of Penglai in Fujian Province of China, and established the Chin Swee Temple Society. Always leading by example, the late Lim began a donation drive by contributing a 28-acre land for the construction of the temple. In addition, his companies Resorts World Bhd and Genting Berhad made a cash donation of RM8.1 million for the building fund. The late Lim was elected as the Chairman of the society while his son, Lim Kok Thay was appointed as its Deputy Chairman. The temple which was officially opened on 29 March 1994 by Ling Liong Sik (then the Malaysian Minister of Transport), overlooks lush green slopes of virgin forest with a view of the winding road ascending to Genting Highlands. Such is the tranquility of the place that just by standing there one can feel the peacefulness of the environment in the midst of the moving white clouds and gentle cool breeze. Construction of the temple was both arduous and dangerous due to the steep and rocky terrain, which made it impossible to utilise modern machinery for fundamental work such as piling. However, with the same tenacity and determination that he put in when building Genting Highlands Resort, the late Lim who acted as the planner, architect, designer, contractor and supervisor used manual labour for the digging of the foundation for the temple. He and his team manually dug holes of 80 to 100 ft in depth for this tricky hill slope development. After all this tedious and time-consuming work the temple was completed in 18 years. More importantly, despite adopting such manual approach in extremely difficult situations and risky environment, there were neither casualties nor work- related accidents reported during the whole period of construction.  Features  The temple's first stage of development, costing an estimated RM12 million, is made up of an imposing traditional structure. A massive statue of Buddha stands behind the building. There is originally around 10,000 blessing lamps installed for those looking to be blessed despite only 2,000 remain until today. The temple has tall red columns supporting an ornamental roof. The exterior wall carries many inscriptions that depict the life of the Reverend Chin Swee and his major charitable and supernatural works. Within the temple, the statue of the Reverend Chin Swee placed in accordance with feng shui principles is seated at the northern part of the main hall with his face looking south. Behind the statue is a natural rock in a man-made flowing stream. The rock gives the necessary support to the statue while the stream provides clear cool mineral water throughout the year. This water has been named \\"Dragon Mineral Water\\" where it could healed the sick. The Reverend Chin Swee's birthday falls on the 6th day of Lunar New Year and is celebrated for ten days beginning from the first day of the Lunar New Year. Going forward and with the completion of these latest additions, the temple committee is planning for more events and celebrations aimed at depicting not only the good deeds of the Reverend Chin Swee but also the richness of the Malaysian Chinese culture.

The students at Sacred Heart Apostolic School praying the Stations of the Cross on Good Friday, 2009 Tel≈°iai Diocese Minor seminary in Lithuania A minor seminary or high school seminary is a secondary day or boarding school created for the specific purpose of enrolling teenage boys who have expressed interest in becoming Catholic priests. They are generally Catholic institutions, and designed to prepare boys both academically and spiritually for vocations to the priesthood and religious life. They emerged in cultures and societies where literacy was not universal, and the minor seminary was seen as a means to prepare younger boys in literacy for later entry into the major seminary. The minor seminary is no longer very familiar in the developed world. The 1917 Code of Canon Law described the purpose of minor seminaries as: \\"to take care especially to protect from the contagion of the world, to train in piety, to imbue with the rudiments of literary studies, and to foster in them the seed of a divine vocation\\". Suitable boys were encouraged to graduate to a major seminary, where they would continue their tertiary studies for the priesthood. The program of priestly formation of the USCCB refers to them as \\"high school seminaries\\" rather than minor seminaries.Program of Priestly Formation - 5th Edition Today, college seminaries, where philosophy is studied, are often called minor seminaries even though they are for those who have completed high school.

Coal was first discovered in the region in 1908, when British authorities found large deposits of coal reserves that could be commercially viable and fuel a railway system. The town was established when the British started mining operations. In 1915, a railway system linking Batu Arang and Kuang was built to transport coal to the rest of the country. As coal output and demand increased, rail services to and from Kuala Lumpur expanded. The demand for coal from Batu Arang skyrocketed due to the First World War, which led to a reduction of coal imports. The local coal was frequently sold to the railway companies, power stations, tin mines, dredges, and end customers. During World War II, in 1942, British authorities halted mining operations, and destroyed the power station and main sub-station as Japanese forces approached Batu Arang. When the Japanese occupied the area, they repaired the damaged equipment and hired more people to mine coal. Their mining methods, however, have left a devastating effect on the coal mine because they only focused on surface mining. When Japan surrendered at the end of World War II, Malayan Collieries resumed mining but were faced with problems such as improper mining methods by Japanese, delayed delivery for new equipment, labor strikes, fire, floods, increasing costs, rising coal prices and competition from petroleum, which is a cheaper and more attractive fuel. These problems led to the permanent closure of the coal mine on January 30, 1960. After the closure of the mine, many miners and workers moved out of town and many buildings became ruins, the coal mine filled with water, land faced soil erosion, and the railway line from Kuang was dismantled, effectively ended railway service in Batu Arang. Despite this, some residents remained in the town and shops, facilities, and amenities continue to operate. On October 16, 2011, the town celebrated 100 years since its establishment and was granted heritage town status to boost economic prospects of its residents and make it one of the most important tourist attractions in Selangor. History =British Malaya era= Coal was first discovered in Malaya in 1908 by Haji Abdul Hadi, a Malay man who was looking for tin near Rawang in Ulu Selangor. Samples were sent to the Inspector of Mines at Kuala Kubu, who forwarded them to the Federated Malay States Geological Survey Department, which sent a geologist to investigate the location of discovery and discovered there are large deposits of coal in this location. There was strong demand in Federated Malay States Railway (FMSR)‚Äîespecially the tin mining activity‚Äîto open up the country to private enterprise. Several interested parties bade for the coal- mining tender. John Archibald Russell initially tried to bid for mining activity under his firm J. A. Russell and Co. but the bid was awarded to Rawang Federated Malay States Coal Syndicate Ltd instead. The company start mining the coal using a diamond drill and hand boring tools but two years later, the company started to lose interest in Batu Arang after discovering the mine has no commercial value. The company then sold the mining tender to John Archibald Russell in 1913. In the same year, however, the price of rubber has decreased globally and many people who initially has interest in buying shares in rubber starting to lose interest. As a result, Russell had to sell some of his past investments and become a major shareholder of Malayan Collieries Limited with help from his associates on June 20, 1914. Malayan Collieries then appointed J. A. Russell and Co. to become general managers and secretaries, and his company issued $1,500,000 worth of capital, in which $500,000 was the working capital, where it was formed on a basis of coal deposits which estimated to be between 10 and 20 million tons of coal and the coal demand was estimated to be around 200,000 tons per annum.Kaur, A. ,1990 p. 75 - 76 The company leased of coal deposits, of which were used for surface plant and miners' housing. Mining machine was ordered from the United Kingdom and the United States. The village was then established to serve the coal mining industry, which is then given name \\"Batu Arang\\" from the Malay word meaning \\"stone charcoal\\". The company hired mining engineer T. C. McCall to manage the mining operations. Federated Malay States Railway then agreed to build an additional railway line that spanned from Kuang to Batu Arang; the new line cost $1 million and was opened to traffic in 1915. The railway company also sold a locomotive designed for shunting to the mining company. In return, the mining company agreed to pay the construction costs of the sidings from Batu Arang station to the pit head. Initially, only one train ran daily between Batu Arang and Kuala Lumpur but the frequency increased as output and demand for coal grew. The mining company also built the road that links the trunk road to the mining area. Bullock carts were used to carry mining equipment and stores to the mining area. The bullock cart was previously used to carry coal to local customers.Kaur, A. ,1990 p. 77 - 80 Total production of coals in tons from 1915 until closure in 1960 The initial output was low; the mine produced an average of 60 tons of coal per day due to it being mined on a small scale and low demand; imported coal was readily available. Most of the coal was used for the colliery's consumption and in 1916, coal from Batu Arang was supplied to two of the largest European tin mines in Malaya. The price of coal was relatively low; it sold at $5 per ton at Batu Arang station. During the First World War, the demand for Batu Arang coal soared as coal imports decreased and then stopped; thereafter, the mining company build new sidings to deal with renewed demand. As of 1939, the mining company conveyed coal and other products to the FSMR system by operating of railway on its property. The main customers for Batu Arang coal were railways, power stations and tin mines, where in 1937, 700 tons of coal were sold to tin dredges, which was followed by the Perak River Hydro-Electric Company (500 tons), FMSR (450 tons), Bangsar Power Station (200 tons) and end customers (150 tons). Thereafter, Batu Arang has played an important role in the Malayan economy by introducing electricity to the Malayan state and improved tin mining through dredges, which outpaced Asian methods of mining tin. Coal production peaked in 1940, when Batu Arang produced 781,509 tons of coal.Kaur, A. ,1990 p. 80 - 83 File:Batu Arang in 1924.jpgBatu Arang in 1924 File:Batu Arang in 1933.jpgBatu Arang in 1933 File:Batu Arang railway station 1918.jpgBatu Arang railway station circa 1918. The station and it's railway line was demolished in 1971. =World War II and decline= Batu Arang surface coal mine in 1949. During World War II, the colonial official advised the mining company to evacuate Batu Arang on January 5, 1942; the mine's machinery was halted, and stores and portable equipment were handed over to the military and FMSR to be transported to Singapore by rail. The military then uses explosives to destroy the power station and its main sub-station. The parent company J. A. Russell and Co. continued to operate in Kuala Lumpur until January 9, 1942, when they fled with their records to Singapore to establish emergency offices and continued to do business there. Once Japanese forces reached Singapore, the company attempted to send all records and equipment to Australia, and open an office there, but the ship conveying them sank on its way to Australia. In Japanese-occupied Malaya, Japanese hired many men to repair the damaged equipment at Batu Arang and continue mining activity. The resumed mining activity allows Japanese army to operate tin mines and run the railway system, allowing them to continue producing and exporting raw minerals from Malaya. Unlike the previous company, which focused on a balance between surface mining and underground mining, the Japanese only mined coal on the surface, which would affect future mining operations due to high operational costs. Prior to their surrender, the Japanese had mined 1,369,834 tons of coal.Kaur, A. ,1990 p. 83 - 84 On September 11, 1945, the British Military Administration took over properties belonging to Malayan Collieries with Indian troops to manage the mine. The Malayan Union government then backed Malayan Collieries from April 1, 1946 until June 30, 1946, when all the properties were returned to the company, which faced several problems that would hamper its coal mining activity. Labor strikes in November 1946 and January 1947 caused the Malayan Government to take over the company under emergency legislation. The shipment of new machinery was delayed and the restoration of coal mining area was slowed down by poor mining methods used by the Japanese, which were further exacerbated by fire and floods in the coal mine. The company could not meet the demand for coal and the increasing operation costs coupled with the rising prices of coal from $12.50 per ton in 1946 to $35.00 per ton in 1959 caused many customers to abandon coal for petroleum. In 1954, the government of Federation of Malaya hired a consulting firm, Messrs Powell Duffryn Technical Services Limited, to investigate the future of Malayan coal; the firm concluded it was not feasible to proceed with coal mining activity due to high costs and inability to compete with petroleum. The Batu Arang mine was permanently closed on January 30, 1960.Kaur, A. ,1990 p. 84 - 85 By this time, the mine has produced over 14,000,000 tons of coal. =Malayan Emergency= Batu Arang was a conflict zone during the Malayan Emergency period, where the Communist Party of Malaya attempted to occupy the town. The communist occupation of Batu Arang caused British authorities to declare it a \\"Black Area\\" until 1960 because it became a base for the anti-British communist forces and the town's topology, which consists of hills and valleys, was an ideal hiding places for communists, who could launch sudden attacks from the area. On July 12, 1948, the communist group seized the coal mine, occupied it for an hour, damaged mining equipment and killed five Chinese people before leaving the mine. The attack on the coal mine raised tentions during the initial period of the Malayan Emergency; there was a shortages of troops in the country to protect residents and to combat the terrorists. Eight days later, twenty people had been arrested in relation with the coal mine attack. Then on July 30, 1948, police and troops killed 22 members and arrested 47 members in their forest hideouts. The communists then derailed a train in Batu Arang on January 25, 1949. The air force launched an attack against communist guerillas on July 20, 1949. A reward of $2,000 was offered for the capture the wanted person Chong Hoy Fong, who was wanted for the terrorist attack; Chong was killed by Scottish guards on January 16, 1950. The police later raided the Indian clubhouse and confiscated communist items such as flags, caps, photographs of communist leaders, posters and documents on April 27, 1950. This incident has caused the closure of 25 shops under emergency regulations on January 25, 1952. =Contemporary era= The plaque that marks the remnants of railway bridge since the dismantlement in 1971. Batu Arang in May 2007 Since the closure of the coal mine, many miners and workers moved out of Batu Arang and many buildings have been left in ruins. Some of these building are being demolished because they are unsafe for occupation or were built over cavities and old mining tunnels. The surface mining area filled with water and is subject to erosion caused by dripping water tables from mining activities. Although many traces of the area's mining past have disappeared, some items such as chimneys are still visible to people, although some chimneys have tree growing in them. The railway track from Kuang to Batu Arang was removed in 1971, ending railway service in Batu Arang. Despite this, many local shops, restaurants, wet markets and other facilities continue to operate and the town now has a multicultural population made up mostly of people with Chinese, Malay and Indian backgrounds. An underground coal-seam fire occurred on September 18, 2011; one family discovered the land behind their house was getting hotter for two weeks before thick, black smoke started emitting from the ground. The fire was extinguished but the family were displaced and that area is deemed to be no longer safe for occupation. In 2011, as the 100th anniversary of Batu Arang's establishment approached, many residents appealed to authorities to give the town heritage status, citing the development of nearby towns such as Bandar Tasik Puteri and Bandar Kota Puteri, which was rapid and left Batu Arang town behind in terms of recent developments. They also urged for the town and its buildings to be preserved to attract tourists, suggesting old buildings such as the police station, brick factory, mine shafts and town hall be renovated and maintained for future generations. In addition, they suggested the abandoned mines be converted for other purposes such as water sports and fishing. On October 16, 2011, during a carnival to celebrate the town's 100th anniversary, Selangor's head of government Khalid Ibrahim awarded heritage town status to Batu Arang to increase the economic prospects of its residents and to make it a tourist attraction, Despite this recognition, it was later reported by Sin Chew Daily that due to lack of local humanity cultivation and support from mapping companies, the development of Batu Arang as a tourism area has been slowed down; this was further exacerbated by Khalid Ibrahim's decision to move to Port Klang to contest the 2013 Malaysian general election. The Christian cemetery in Batu Arang, where foreigners had buried their dead since 2011, has become controversial due to the illegal burial of foreigners, usually of Asian origin, including Vietnamese, Thai and Cambodian, without burial permits and documents; these burials occurred at night, which caught the attention of the cemetery coordinator and reported to police several times, claiming the cemetery is intended for the burial of local people only. These claims were later supported by Gombak district officer Datuk Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan, who was told the illegal burial service costs RM 5,000 per session and would launch the investigation into this matter. The Christian cemetery was officially gazette by Gombak authorities on September 25, 2014, and any foreigners who wanted to bury their dead must first obtain permission from Batu Arang police department before doing so. On April 9, 2018, a century-old chimney previously belonging to a defunct brick company was demolished after being abandoned by the company and overgrown with trees. The land it stood on was later acquired by a private owner, who plan to demolish the century-old brick factory building, including the chimney. The chimney's demolition shocked the residents and complaints were filed to the Malaysian Chinese Association of Batu Arang branch, which led to the suspension of the demolition of the factory building. It was later discovered the chimney and the brick factory were not gazette as a Batu Arang heritage site because the previous land owner had yet to sign an agreement with state government. The private owner stated he demolished the chimney because of safety concerns; the chimney itself has fallen into despair and he was planning to rebuild a replica of it. Geography =Climate= Cloudy in Batu Arang Batu Arang's climate is classified as tropical. Rainfall in the area is quite significant throughout the year. This climate is Af according to the K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification. The temperature here averages . The average annual rainfall is . Precipitation is lowest in July, with an average of . The average for November‚Äîthe wettest month‚Äîis . At an average temperature of , May is the hottest month of the year. The coolest month is January, with an average temperature of . Between the driest and wettest months, the difference in precipitation is . =Environmental issues= Illegal dumping of materials containing toxic waste was discovered on January 15, 2004, and a lawsuit was filed against the responsible parties. Among the toxic materials found were paint, glues and chemicals that are used in the construction industry. Four years later, another waste-dumping issue was discovered when two contractors dumped waste collected from a sewerage processing plant in Puchong into their palm oil estate in Batu Arang and left it to dry and become fertilizer. The waste generated strong odors that affected the lives of the town's residents. Since 2010, flooding has frequently occurred on an annual basis in some parts of town, especially the roundabout, which cut off access to schools, the police station and the fire station. It was caused by the aging drainage system, which had fallen into despair. More complains were filed by residents in 2019. To mitigate the flooding problem, a new drainage system was constructed in February 2020, and was completed in April 2020. Transportation Batu Arang is accessible via several roads that link Batu Arang with Taman Tasik Puteri and Kampung Baru Kundang, Kundang and Rawang. Railway services to the town were ended in 1971. In 2019, public transportation was again provided with a free bus service known as Bus Smart Selangor; the line runs from SK Batu Arang school to Sungai Buloh KTM - MRT railway station. Bicycle use in this town is widespread for both residents as utility cycling and non-residents who cycle for recreation, and the old bicycle shop in the town continue to operate. Health A public clinic in Batu Arang was opened by the government in 1970 to provide medical services to Batu Arang residents. Residents can also access the clinics and hospitals in Kundang and Sungai Buloh via the free bus service provided by Smart Selangor, which stops at these medical facilities since the introduction of these new stations in June 2019. Batu Arang houses a Welcome Community Home, a rehabilitation center for drug addicts and HIV / AIDS patients, which previously operated in Kuala Lumpur in 1997 and moved to Batu Arang in 1998, where it occupies a former poultry farm. , the rehabilitation center has housed 600 persons since 1997. In addition, there is an orphanage in Batu Arang that houses children who are affected by HIV / AIDS and have suffered from social stigma; these children were denied access to education and were unable to open bank accounts, which led to them being unbanked and unable to obtain a Malaysian identity card, making them stateless and unemployed. Sports Road bike stacked in a bicycle parking After the town's foundation, two separate sporting facilities were built for different demographics. A sports center known as the Asiatic Sports Club was designed for Asian residents; this had a badminton court, and soccer and cricket fields.Kaur, A. , 1990 p. 89 This sports center has been closed and the building currently houses Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) center since the 1960s. The soccer field remains intact and continues to operate today, in addition to the nearby basketball court. A separate clubhouse catered for European residents; this was known as the European Club. The clubhouse provided facilities for billiards, table tennis, lawn tennis, dancing and swimming. The clubhouse was closed in the 1970s and the building has been converted into a residential house. Batu Arang has become the venue for several cycling activities and the town has become popular among cyclists, who perceive it as an ideal place for cycling. The routes are suitable for beginners, with little traffic, clean air, good relationship between cyclists and drivers, and a cuisine haven. Residents of Batu Arang often show a warm welcome to visitors to their town. Most of the riders comes from Shah Alam, Kuala Selangor, Ijok and Rawang. Several international professional racing and UCI-sanctioned cycling events , including the Tour de Langkawi and the Jelajah Malaysia, have been held in the town, where cyclists passed through it. Residents also organize cycling events to attract local cyclists and bring more attention to the heritage value of the town. Trail running events such as Deuter International Trail Run, which attracts 3,000 runners, have been held in Batu Arang. Some residents of Batu Arang also practice equestrianism and Silat. Films Several Chinese New Year films have been filmed in Batu Arang. A 2018 film, A House of Happiness, was filmed in March 2017 for 13 days. Fight Lah! Kopitiam was filmed in Batu Arang in 2019 and was released in 2020. The red lanterns that were used during filming were the only items that remain in the filming location.

Still-life, 1924 Biography A descendant of Patrick Henry, Bruce was born in Campbell County, Virginia, the second of four children. His family had once owned a huge plantation, Berry Hill, worked by over 3,000 slaves. Berry Hill Estate originally was part of a tract granted by the English Crown in 1728 to William Byrd II. (Berry Hill is now a resort and conference center outside South Boston, Virginia and is a National Historic Landmark.) The Civil War left the Bruces' wealth greatly diminished. Bruce began taking evening classes at the Art Club of Richmond in 1898, while working in a real estate office during the daytime. His earliest known extant painting dates from 1900.Agee and Rose 1979, p.42. In 1902 he moved to New York, where he studied with William Merritt Chase, Robert Henri, and Kenneth Hayes Miller. By February 1904 he was in Paris, where he would live until 1933. Although his evolution toward a modernist style was gradual, his works of 1908 reveal the influence of Renoir and C√©zanne, and in that year he was among the first to enroll in Matisse's school. Bruce exhibited regularly in the Salon d'Automne, and met many of the leading artists of the early twentieth century avant garde. During a period of close friendship with Sonia and Robert Delaunay in 1912‚Äì14 his paintings were influenced by Orphism, but Bruce never formed an attachment to any school. Although he never exhibited with the Synchromists or gave his paintings Synchromist titles,Agee and Rose 1979, p.8. in 1916 he developed a form of abstract painting that strongly resembled Morgan Russell's synchromist compositions of muscular, flat color areas (for example, see Bruce's Composition I). The style of his mature work anticipated the Purism developed by L√©ger and Ozenfant in the 1920s. In his paintings of 1918 and later, hard-edged geometric forms are arranged as on a tabletop and rendered in evenly applied, flat colors. His work was admired by Marcel DuchampAgee and Rose 1979, p.6. and may have influenced the style adopted by his former teacher, Matisse, in his mural La Danse (1932‚Äì33, in the Barnes Foundation, Merion, Pennsylvania).Agee and Rose 1979, p.11.

At that time, he recognized 16 species.Helmut R√∂ssler. 1959. \\"Revision der Arctotideae - Gorteriinae (Compositae)\\". Mitteilungen der Botanischen Staatssammlung M√ºnchen 3:71-500. Roessler published some amendments to his treatment in 1973.Helmut Roessler. 1973. Mitteilungen der Botanischen Staatssammlung Muenchen 11:91-99. In 2009, a phylogeny of the genus was published. It was based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequences. In this study, all of Roessler's species except Gazania othonnites were sampled. The authors found that eight species were not really separate, but formed a species complex. The seven species found to be distinct were G. jurineifolia, G. caespitosa, G. ciliaris, G. tenuifolia, G. heterochaeta, G. schenckii, and G. lichtensteinii. Distribution The genus occurs from low-altitude sands to alpine meadows in South Africa, Swaziland, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Angola. Additionally, species are naturalised and declared weed in South Australia, New Zealand, the Mediterranean, and California. Cultivation Gazania species are grown for the brilliant colour of their flowerheads which appear in the late spring and are often in bloom throughout the summer into autumn. They prefer a sunny position and are tolerant of dryness and poor soils. Numerous cultivars have been selected for variety of colour and habit. In temperate regions, they are usually grown as half-hardy annuals. A commonly grown variety is the trailing gazania (Gazania rigens var. leucolaena). It is commonly used as groundcover and can be planted en masse to cover large areas or embankments, assisted by its fast growth rate. Cultivars of this variety include 'Sunburst', 'Sunglow', and 'Sunrise Yellow'. Another popular cultivated variety is the clumping gazania (Gazania rigens), which has a number of named cultivars including 'Aztec', 'Burgundy', 'Copper King', 'Fiesta Red', 'Goldrush' and 'Moonglow'.

The caves were named after a nearby parish church and since 1989 are home to the \\"Smugglers Adventure\\" tourist attraction which tells the story of smuggling on the South Coast of England 200 years ago. History The earliest written reference about the caves was about an old man and woman who were discharged from the town workhouse for misbehaviour and who lived in the mysterious caves from 1783. The couple lived at the bottom of the 'Monks Walk'Historical Hastings Wiki: St Clements Caves - Historical Hastings Wiki, accessdate: 10 December 2019, a 140 feet (44 metres) long tunnel which is now the start of the caves tour. In the 1820s, the caves were rediscovered by a local grocer named Joseph Golding. He was cutting a garden seat into the side of the cliff for his boss when he broke through to the vast cavern. They became a tourist attraction in 1864 and were visited by the Prince and Princess of Wales. In 1873 the caves received another royal visit from Prince Albert and Prince George Frederick. During the Second World War the caves became an air raid shelter and a temporary home, originally for 200-400 people and then, for up to 900 people as the war drew on. Even once when the West Hill received a direct hit from a bomb, the caves remained undamaged. Modern tourist attraction On 25 March 1989 St Clements Caves reopened as the Smugglers Adventure, a centre for the history of smuggling on the south coast of England. Dozens of life-size figures, push-button tableaux, dramatic lighting, eerie sound effects and a few surprises bring the romantic yet often bloody heyday of smuggling to life. The Ballroom is now a converted gift shop and the main entrance to the attraction. In June 1998 the attraction reopened after a major refit, which introduced fictional smuggler 'Hairy Jack' who guides visitors round the caves, along with new displays, hands-on features and interactive activities. In February 2012 the Smugglers Adventure reopened after another set of major renovations, which included the installation of a brand new audio-visual infrastructure, and of new lighting systems to highlight the caves‚Äô extraordinary architecture and natural geological formations. There is also a time capsule buried in a wall of the caves which was placed there in 1966 (the 900th anniversary year of the Battle of Hastings) and is due to be opened in 2066.

Classical dances There are three main styles of Sri Lankan classical dance: *The Kandyan dances of the Hill Country, known as Uda Rata Natum; *The low country dances of the southern plains, known as Pahatha Rata Natum; *Sabaragamuwa dances, or Sabaragamuwa Natum. Kandyan dance takes its name from Kandy, the last royal capital of Sri Lanka, which is situated about 120 kilometers from the modern capital at Colombo. This genre is today considered the classical dance of Sri Lanka. In Sanskrit terminology it is considered pure dance (nrtta); it features a highly developed system of \\"tala\\" (rhythm), provided by cymbals called \\"thalampataa\\". There are five distinct types; the ves, naiyandi, uddekki, pantheru, and vannams. The three classical dance forms differ in their styles of body-movements and gestures, in the costumes worn by the performers, and in the shape and size of the drums used to provide rhythmic sound patterns to accompany the dancing. The drum used in Kandyan dancing is known as the Geta Bera, the drum in Ruhunu (low country) dancing as the \\"Yak Bera\\", and drum in Sabaragamu dancing as the \\"Davula\\" (the word Bera or Bereya in Sinhale means \\"Drum\\") The Geta Bera is beaten with the hands as is also Yak Bera, while the Davula is played with a stick on one side and with one hand on the other side; the Geta Bera has a body which tapers on both sides while the Yak Bera and the Davula both have cylindrical bodies. The main distinguishing feature between Kandyan and Sabaragamu dancing, and Ruhunu dancing, is that Ruhunu dancers wear masks. Dance styles Female Dancers with Traditional Kandyan Dress =Kandyan dances (Uda Rata Natum) = Ves dance \\"Ves\\" dance, the most popular, originated from an ancient purification ritual, the Kohomba Yakuma or Kohomba Kankariya. The dance was propitiatory, never secular, and performed only by males. The elaborate ves costume, particularly the headgear, is considered sacred and is believed to belong to the deity Kohomba. Only toward the end of the 19th century were ves dancers first invited to perform outside the precincts of the Kankariya Temple at the annual Kandy Perahera festival. Today the elaborately costumed ves dancer epitomizes Kandyan dance. Naiyandi dance Dancers in Naiyandi costume perform during the initial preparations of the Kohomba Kankariya festival, during the lighting of the lamps and the preparation of foods for the demons. The dancer wears a white cloth and white turban, beadwork decorations on his chest, a waistband, rows of beads around his neck, silver chains, brass shoulder plates, anklets, and jingles. This is a graceful dance, also performed in Maha Visnu (Vishnu) and Kataragama Devales temples on ceremonial occasions. Uddekki dance Uddekki is a very prestigious dance. Its name comes from the uddekki, a small lacquered hand drum in the shape of an hourglass, about seven and half inches (18 centimeters) high, believed to have been given to people by the gods. The two drumskins are believed to have been given by the god Iswara, and the sound by Visnu; the instrument is said to have been constructed according to the instructions of Sakra and was played in the heavenly palace of the gods. It is a very difficult instruments to play. The dancer sings as he plays, tightening the strings to obtain variations of pitch. Pantheru dance The pantheruwa is an instrument dedicated to the goddess Pattini. It resembles a tambourine (without the skin) and has small cymbals attached at intervals around its circumference. The dance is said to have originated in the days of Prince Siddhartha, who became Buddha. The gods were believed to use this instrument to celebrate victories in war, and Sinhala kings employed pantheru dancers to celebrate victories in the battlefield. The costume is similar to that of the uddekki dancer, but the pantheru dancer wears no beaded jacket and substitutes a silk handkerchief at the waist for the elaborate frills of the uddekki dancer. Vana The word \\"vannam\\" comes from the Sinhala word \\"varnana\\" (descriptive praise). Ancient Sinhala texts refer to a considerable number of \\"vannams\\" that were only sung; later they were adapted to solo dances, each expressing a dominant idea. History reveals that the Kandyan king Sri Weeraparakrama Narendrasinghe gave considerable encouragement to dance and music. In this Kavikara Maduwa (a decorated dance arena) there were song and poetry contests. It is said that the kavi (poems sung to music) for the eighteen principal vannams were composed by an old sage named Ganithalankara, with the help of a Buddhist priest from the Kandy temple. The vannams were inspired by nature, history, legend, folk religion, folk art, and sacred lore, and each is composed and interpreted in a certain mood (rasaya) or expression of sentiment. The eighteen classical vannams are gajaga (\\"elephant\\"), thuranga (\\"horse\\"), mayura (\\"peacock\\"), gahaka (\\"conch shell\\"), uranga (\\"crawling animals\\"), mussaladi (\\"hare\\"), ukkussa (\\"eagle\\"), vyrodi (\\"precious stone\\"), hanuma (\\"monkey\\"), savula (\\"cock\\"), sinharaja (\\"lion\\"), naga (\\"cobra\\"), kirala (\\"red-wattled lapwing\\"), eeradi (\\"arrow\\"), Surapathi (in praise of the goddess Surapathi), Ganapathi (in praise of the god Ganapathi), uduhara (expressing the pomp and majesty of the king), and assadhrusa (extolling the merit of Buddha). To these were added samanala (\\"Butterfly\\"), bo (the sacred bo tree at Anuradhapura, a sapling of the original bo tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment), and hansa vannama (\\"swan\\"). The vannama dance tradition has seven components: dog dance, cat dance, lion dance, ostrich dance, parrot dance, etc. =Low Country dances (Pahatharata Natum)= Maha Sammata king & queen Kolam Kolam is a type of Performing Art unique to the Country .

This form of dance is performed to appease evil spirits which cause sickness and is thus called 'Devil Dance'. The dancers wear masks depicting many characters varied in forms of bird, demons, reptiles, etc. There are 18 main dances related to pahatharata style known as the Daha Ata Sanniya held to exorcise 18 types of diseases from the human body. =Sabaragamu dances (Sabaragamuwa Natum)= The dances are usually performed in Ratnapura, relating to the worshipping of God Saman much revered by local people. There are 32 main dances in Sabaragamuwa Style. Devil dances Devil Dances at the turn of the twentieth century. Mask of the demon Maha Sohona used in the Tovil Healing Ritual in Sri Lanka The \\"Devil Dances\\" are an attempt to respond to the common belief that certain ailments are caused by unseen hands and that they should be chased away for the patient to get cured. If an individual or a family is not doing well, the village-folk believe that it's because that person or the family is being harassed by unseen hands. A 'tovil' ceremony is the answer.\\"The yakun natima - devil dance ritual of Sri Lanka\\" at WWW Virtual Library - Sri Lanka The 'tovil' can be a simple ritualistic ceremony at home restricted to family and immediate neighbours or involving the whole village like the 'gam-maduva' or the 'devol- maduva' which is closely linked to the worship of gods. Masked dancers take part in at least two of the well-known 'tovil' ceremonies referred to as the 'Maha Sohon Samayama' and the 'Gara Yakuma'. The mention of 'Maha Sohona' frightens the people since he is believed to be the demon of the graveyards. The performer disguises himself as a bear and wears a mask and a dress to resemble one. Often the 'tovil' involves the 'sanni' dances where all the dancers wear masks. The 'daha ata sanniya' refers to eighteen ailments with a demon being responsible for each one of them. Dancers wearing masks depicting different characters take part in processions while at certain ceremonies. Of later origin are the masks worn by children and teenagers at street performances during Vesak. Popularly known as 'olu bakko' for the simple reason that oversize masks are worn, these performances keep the younger folk, in particular, entertained. The simple version of the devil dance ritual usually starts in the morning with the building of the stage, decorations and preparation of the costumes. The performers build an intricate stage before which the dancing commences. The stage consists of a wall made of freshly cut natural materials such as coconut palm tree and banana tree trunks. Depending on the region and the available materials the stage may also be coated with clay mud. The dances are accompanied by drummers which also herald the begin of the ritual. The distinctive sound ensures all neighbours turn up to take part. The full ritual usually lasts until the morning, with the dancers consuming betel-nut juice and drinking coke to stay awake. Dances can however also go on for multiple days. Folk dances Apart from the classical dance forms there are also folk dances, which are associated with folk activities and festivities. Leekeli (stick dance), kalagedi (pot dance), raban (hand drum), and polkatu (coconut) are folk dances prevalent at the present time. Dance drama There is also in the low country a dance-drama called Kolam, in which the performers wear masks depicting animals or people such as kings or high officials. The Kolam provides amusement and social satire rather than ritual. It has been suggested by scholars e. g. Sarachchandra, E., \\"The folk Drama of Ceylon\\" that Kolam may have developed from the ritual known as Sanni Yakuma, later becoming a dance-drama independent of ritual elements. Dances today and then The classical dance forms are associated with performance of various rituals and ceremonies which are centuries old and are based on folk religion and folk beliefs going back to before the advent of Buddhism and its acceptance by the Sinhalese people in the 3rd century BC. These rituals and ceremonies reflect the values, beliefs and customs of an agricultural civilisation. The pre-Buddhistic folk religion consisted of the belief in a variety of deities and demons who were supposed to be capable of awarding benefits and blessings, but also causing afflictions and diseases. Accordingly, they had to be either propitiated or exorcised with offerings and the performance of rituals and ceremonies. The repertoire of Kandyan dancing has its origins in the ritual known as the Kohomba Kankariya, which is performed to propitiate the deity known as Kohomba for the purpose of obtaining relief from personal afflictions or from communal calamities such as pestilence. Although this ritual is rarely performed at the present, the various dances associated with its performance could be seen in the Kandy Perahera, and annual religion-cultural event which takes place in the city of Kandy in honour of the sacred tooth-relic of the Buddha housed in the Dalada Maligawa, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth. The repertoire of Ruhunu dancing has its origins in the rituals of the Devol Maduwa - used to propitiate the Deity/demon Devol - and in exorcistic rituals known as the Rata Yakuma and the Sanni Yakuma - associated with various demons who are supposed to cause a variety of afflictions and incurable illnesses. Saparagamu dancing is associated with the ritual known as the Gam Maduwa, which is performed to propitiate the goddess Pattini. The purpose is to obtain a good harvest or to ward off evil or to be rid of an infectious disease.

Ban Canal There is a large canal that starts from Tanjong Karang which crossed but merged using watergate to Sungai Tengi. The canal ends in the district of Sabak Bernam. It was first built during the colonial era and is often called by the locals as bangkenal. Its function is to provide enough water to irrigate the rice crops; it is also used by a water supply company to provide treated water and as a place for freshwater fish farming among the villagers. In the past, this canal is involved in the forest harvesting activities. It serves as a router in sweeping the harvested timber by drifting it over the water to the 'Headworks' where the collection works is done for land transportation. There are myths from the older people who claimed there was a giant snake found during the construction of this canal. It led to the cessation of further construction work at Seri Tiram. The ban canal has been used to irrigate rice crops by farmers. Historic building There is an old historic building left without care at Kampung Sungai Kajang. It is believed that the building was at one time a palm sugar processing plant built during the colonial period. During the Second World War, the factory was captured and used as a Japanese military base. Some effects of the ravages of battle can be seen today.

It is located 100 km to the east of Asuncion on a branch of the Pan-American Highway, \\"Ruta #2\\". The county comprises an urban area of around 8,000 inhabitants and some twelve smaller satellite villages or dependencies known as \\"colonias\\" raising its population to roughly 20,000 inhabitants. Although there is some controversy regarding its foundation, the official version is that it was founded by a former governor of Paraguay, Don Pedro Melo de Portugal on March 19, 1780, still during the time of Spanish colonialism and later elevated to a municipality in 1884. Like most towns in Paraguay with few exceptions, the colonial architecture survived until the early 1980s when, due to a lack of protective laws, it suffered a massive destruction and replacement by generic modern structures. It comprises an 887 km2 surface and topographically has two remarkably different types of terrain. The colonies to the west of the town are mostly formed by mild slopes with very fertile land adequate for cultivation of most agricultural products such as cotton, cassava, tobacco, soybean, sugarcane and some grains) and therefore more prosperous, whereas the east is characterized by mostly planes with few patches of elevated land good for agriculture. This region is mostly driven by raising cattle, but in recent years, it was discovered that these plains provide the ideal soil for sugar cane cultivation, the raw material for biofuel. It is worth mentioning that, in recent years, from the start of 2005, Paraguay has gained a privileged place in the international meet market entering demanding ones such as the European Union, Taiwan, Russia and Chile. This progress obviously has its repercussions to the eastern region of the town given the fact that these colonies are primarily dedicated to raising cattle. This also brought along other impacts such as a remarkable appreciation of the real estate value of the land. San Jose is in general an average Paraguayan town with a promising future based on the bio-fuel exploitation and the emerging solid cattle industry which, if administered wisely, can drastically change the fate of this town.

Several of Bidlake's houses in the Birmingham area were featured in Hermann Muthesius's book ' (\\"The English House\\"), which was to prove influential on the early Modern Movement in Germany.  Life and career  Bidlake was born in Wolverhampton, the son of local architect George Bidlake (1830-1892) from whom he received his earliest architectural training. He attended Tettenhall College and Christ's College, Cambridge. In 1882 he moved to London where he studied at the Royal Academy Schools and worked for Gothic Revival architects Bodley and Garner. In 1885 he won the RIBA Pugin Travelling Fellowship for his draughtsmanship, which enabled him to spend 1886 travelling in Italy. On returning to England in 1887 Bidlake settled in Birmingham where he set up in independent practice and, from 1893, pioneered the teaching of architecture at the Birmingham School of Art. Famously ambidextrous, his party trick was to sketch with both hands simultaneously. Bidlake designed many Arts and Crafts- influenced houses in upmarket Birmingham districts such as Edgbaston, Moseley, and Four Oaks (the latter then in Warwickshire and absorbed into Birmingham in 1974), along with a series of more Gothic-influenced churches such as St Agatha's, Sparkbrook - generally considered his masterpiece. He was an associate, member, treasurer and then, from 1902-38, Professor of Architecture of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists. In 1924, Bidlake married a woman over twenty years younger than himself and moved to Wadhurst in East Sussex, where he continued to practise until his death there in 1938.

He served as Minister of the Navy in the Russian Provisional Government in 1917. Early Life and family Verderevsky was from an ancient noble family. His father Nikolai Verderevsky was a barrister. His mother was Sophia Alexandrova Repins. He had two brothers: Vasily, an army officer and Roman, a navy officer who fought in the siege of Port Arthur. Verderevsky married Elena Mikhailovna Plen (died 1944) and they had one son, Pavel Dmitrievich (1896-1985), an engineer, who lived in exile in France and is buried next to his father. Naval career Verderevsky graduated from the Sea Cadet Corps in 1893 and from the naval artillery class in 1898. He moved to the naval reserve in 1900 and was involved in shipbuilding on the Aral Sea in Turkestan. He rejoined the active navy in 1904 on the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War and commanded a destroyer in the Black Sea Fleet. In 1905 he was gunnery officer on the battleship Petr Velikiy and had a role as a fleet gunnery instructor. He was wounded during the mutiny on the cruiser Pamiat Azova in 1906. From 1906 to 1909 he worked on the journal Morskoy Sbornik (Naval Review). In 1908 he was senior officer on the Petr Velikiy and squadron gunnery officer in the Baltic Fleet, he also taught gunnery at the Nikolayev Naval Academy. In 1910-11 he commanded the destroyer General Kondratenko. He took command of the destroyer Novik in 1911, and the cruiser Admiral Makarov in 1914. At the start of World War I he was given a posting ashore coordinating the work on range-finding equipment in St Petersburg-based factories. In 1915 he was given command of the cruiser Bogatyr. In 1916 he was made commander of the submarine division of the Baltic Fleet based at Reval and promoted to rear admiral. Activity in 1917 After the February Revolution he was made chief of staff of the Baltic Fleet and subsequently fleet commander and assistant to Boris Dudorov, the first Navy minister of the Provisional Government, but failed to put down a mutiny. In July he was arrested, tried and acquitted of \\"disclosure of official secrets and disobeying the central authorities\\". As an admiral with a democratic reputation he was appointed Navy Minister in the Kerensky Government in August. Many military leaders had a negative attitude to the activities of Verderevsky and the War Minister of the Provisional Government of General A. I. Verkhovskii. Their point of view was expressed by General Anton Denikin, who said that the Minister of Marine had utopian initiatives: \\"Verderevsky preached that \\"discipline must be voluntary. We must come to terms with the mass (!) And on the basis of a common love of country to encourage it voluntarily to assume all the burdens of military discipline. It is essential that the discipline is no longer wearing a disagreeable nature of coercion. \\" He was an advocate of Russia's withdrawal from the war. On 24 October, in solidarity with the Minister of War A. I. Verkhovsky, also an early supporter of an early peace, Verderevsky drafted his resignation, but had not submitted it by the time the October Revolution broke out. On 26 October 1917 he was arrested by the Bolsheviks in the Winter Palace, together with other members of the Provisional Government. The next day, was released on parole. He provided technical guidance on operational fleet actions to defend the country. In exile Verderevsky was not involved in the White movement. Initially moving to London in 1918, he settled in Paris in 1920 and was an active Freemason. After World War II he became reconciled with the Soviets and was granted Soviet citizenship in 1946. He was criticised for this by fellow exile Roman Gul. Verderevsky is buried in Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery.

The jib is backed to windward, the mainsail is slightly eased, and the rudder is fixed in an attempt to turn into the wind (which is coming from the top of the diagram). In sailing, heaving to (to heave to and to be hove to) is a way of slowing a sailing vessel's forward progress, as well as fixing the helm and sail positions so that the vessel does not have to be steered. It is commonly used for a \\"break\\"; this may be to wait for the tide before proceeding, or to wait out a strong or contrary wind. For a solo or shorthanded sailor it can provide time to go below deck, to attend to issues elsewhere on the boat or to take a meal break.www.sailingusa.info/points_of_sail.htm It is also used as a storm tactic. The term is also used in the context of vessels under power and refers to bringing the vessel to a complete stop. For example, in waters over which the United States has jurisdiction the Coast Guard may, under , demand that a boat \\"heave to\\" in order to enforce federal laws. Hove to A sailing vessel is hove to when it is at or nearly at rest because the driving action from one or more sails is approximately balanced by the drive from the other(s). This always involves 'backing' one or more sails, so that the wind is pressing against the forward side of the cloth, rather than the aft side as it normally would for the sail to drive the vessel forwards. On large square rigged, multi-masted vessels the procedures can be quite complex and varied, but on a modern two-sailed sloop, there is only the jib and the mainsail. A cutter may have more than one headsail, and a ketch, yawl or schooner may have more than one sail on a boom. In what follows, the jibs and boomed sails on such craft can either be treated as one of each, or lowered for the purposes of reduced windage, heel or complexity when heaving to for any length of time. When a sloop is hove to, the jib is backed. This means that its windward sheet is tight holding the sail to windward. The mainsail sheet is often eased, or the mainsail reefed, to reduce forward movement, or 'fore-reaching'. The rudder is placed so that, should the boat make any forward movement, it will be turned into the wind, so as to prevent forward momentum building up. In a centerboard boat the centerboard will be partially raised and the tiller held down hard. Heaving to Oc√©an class ship of the line heaving to. Drawing by Antoine Morel-Fatio. For a sloop sailing along normally, either of two maneuvers will render the sailboat to be hove to. First, the jib can be literally heaved to windward, using the windward sheet and releasing the other. Then the rudder would be put across so as to turn gently towards the wind. Without the drive of the jib, and allowing time for momentum to die down, the sailboat will be unable to tack and will stop hove to. This method may be preferable when broad reaching or running before a strong wind in a heavy sea and the prospect of tacking through the wind in order to heave to may not appeal. Bearing away from the wind so that the headsail is blanketed by the mainsail can make it easier to haul in the windward sheet. Alternatively, the vessel can simply be turned normally to tack through the wind, without freeing the jibsheet. The mainsail should self-tack onto the other side, but the jib is held aback. Finally the rudder is put the other way, as if trying to tack back again. Without the drive of the jib, she cannot do this and will stop hove to. This method is fast to implement and is recommended by sail training bodies such as the RYA as a 'quick stop' reaction to a man overboard emergency, for sailing boats that have an engine available for further maneuvers to approach and pick up the casualty. Finally, in either case, the tiller or wheel should be lashed so that the rudder cannot move again, and the mainsheet adjusted so that the boat lies with the wind ahead of the beam with minimal speed forward. Usually this involves easing the sheet slightly compared to a closehauled position, but depending on the relative sizes of the sails, the shape and configuration of the keel and rudder and the state of the wind and sea, each skipper will have to experiment. After this the boat can be left indefinitely, only keeping a lookout for other approaching vessels. When hove to, the boat will heel, there will be some drift to leeward and some tendency to forereach, so adequate seaway must be allowed for. In rough weather, this leeway can actually leave a 'slick' effect to windward, in which the waves are smaller than elsewhere. This can make a rest or meal break a little more comfortable at times. To come out from the hove-to position and get under way again, the tiller or wheel is unlashed and the windward jibsheet is released, hauling in the normal leeward one. Bearing off the wind using the rudder will get the boat moving and then she can be maneuvered onto any desired course. It is important when choosing the tack, heaving to, and remaining hove to, in a confined space that adequate room is allowed for these maneuvers. Heaving to as a storm tactic Heaving to has been successfully used by a number of yachts to survive storm conditions (winds greater than Force 10, 48‚Äì55 knots, 89‚Äì102 km/h, 55‚Äì63 mph). During the June 1994 Queen's Birthday Storm all yachts that hove to successfully survived the storm. This included Sabre, a 10.4 m (34 ft) steel cutter with two persons on board, which hove to in wind speeds averaging 80 knots for 6 hours with virtually no damage. During the ill-fated 1979 Fastnet race, of 300 yachts, 158 chose to adopt storm tactics; 86 'lay ahull', whereby the yacht adopts a 'beam on' attitude to the wind and waves; 46 ran before the wind under bare poles or trailing warps/sea anchors and 26 hove to. 100 yachts suffered knock downs, 77 rolled (that is turtled) at least once. Not one of the hove to yachts were capsized (knocked down or turtled) or suffered any serious damage. The 'heave to' maneuver is described in the story of the first Golden Globe yacht race of 1968.

Early life Benyon was educated at Wellington School, Somerset from 1956 to 1960. Parliamentary career Benyon twice stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in Labour-held seats. In February 1974 he contested Huyton in Merseyside against the former (and future) Prime Minister, Harold Wilson. In the following election in October that year, he contested Wood Green in London but was again beaten, this time by the Labour incumbent Joyce Butler. After the murder of Airey Neave just before the 1979 general election, Benyon became the new candidate to be Member of Parliament (MP) for the Conservative stronghold of Abingdon, which he won with ease. However, in 1983, the seat was abolished in boundary changes, and Benyon did not stand for the Oxford West & Abingdon or Wantage seats that replaced it. He has not stood for Parliament since. Other work He was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1979‚Äì1983. In 2002, Tom and Olivia Jane Benyon, with James Pringle, Sue Gibbs, Clare Hayns, James Maberly and the Rev David Streater, founded a charity called ZANE. It was spearheaded by Tom Benyon after he met Cathy Olds whose husband Martin was hacked to death in Zimbabwe the previous year, in 2001, when their farm was occupied by Robert Mugabe loyalists. In 2005 he was elected for a five-year term, as a lay representative of the Diocese of Oxford, to the General Synod of the Church of England. He remains an active member of the Church.

A sea anchor is not used, allowing the boat to drift freely, completely at the mercy of the storm. Ideally the boat should rest with the wind just forward of the beam so the boat is not broadside onto the waves. Modern boats with fin keels may have too much windage at the bows for this technique and come to rest broadside on or may not be stable at all.

Students pursuing this degree study the aspects of research in the field of marketing. Unlike an M.B.A., which is a general business degree, the Master of Marketing Research focuses solely on the aspects of marketing research.  History  The first Master of Marketing Research was developed by the Terry College of Business, University of Georgia in 1979. Marketing faculty, together with leading marketing research professionals, developed a curriculum that \\"was designed to develop marketing research professionals of the highest caliber and thereby satisfy a critical need of U.S. business.\\" This was further followed by the MMR program at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 1986 and the MSMR program at The University of Texas at Arlington in 1990. To date, these three programs are considered to be the pioneers of higher education in the marketing research industry.  Master of Marketing Research degree  Generally, a Master of Marketing Research combines classroom work with real-world research opportunities and special projects. Courses stress practical application to real-world marketing research problems, rather than the theoretical application suggested in most bachelor's business degrees. These degrees give specific instruction on research methodology, variable coding, and database construction and management. Classroom topics might include database management, focus group development, statistics in marketing, and consumer behavior. = Different Program Titles = The Master of Marketing Research (M.M.R) may also be known as the Master of Science in Marketing Research (M.S.M.R.), Master of Science in Marketing Analytics (M.S.M.A.). Similar in nature to the Master of Marketing Research is a Master of Business Administration with an emphasis in marketing research. In Europe, the degree is known as Master in Market Research and Consumer Behavior at IE University/IE Business School and as Master of Marketing Analysis at Ghent University. In Canada, the degree is known as Master of Business- Marketing/Analysis. In Australia, the degree is known as Master of Business in Marketing Research (M.B.M.R.) at Edith Cowan University, and as Master of Marketing (M.Mrkt.) at the University of Tasmania. =Curriculum= The curriculum of any Marketing Research program requires a student to complete the required prerequisites to accommodate the deficiency for non business background students. After that there are a series of core classes and electives. Some of the programs are lock step method programs following a particular sequence of series of courses lined up one after another. Other programs are open programs giving the students to chance to select their own courses. The courses are mainly divided into two genres qualitative and quantitative =Qualitative= Qualitative research consists of in-depth interviews famously called as IDI's as well as focus group. The qualitative research is mainly focus on cognitive and social psychology effect of marketing research. Understanding the thought process rather than analyzing it is the main priority of qualitative research. =Quantitative= Quantitative research mainly deals with application of bi-variate and multivariate statistics to marketing research. IBM SPSS is mostly widely used tool for data analysis though some companies would prefer to stay with excel and WinCross. Industrial application of statistics is limited to cross tabulations using Chi square estimation, but some companies do use linear and logistic regression analysis. More recently, Conjoint analysis is one the new techniques that has become popular for its application on product bundling and pricing. Quantitative research is applied to ad-hoc and tracking studies; it is mainly primary research with different studies (methods) and analysis techniques. ;Type of Quantitative Studies Concept testing, Copy testing, Customer experience study, Pricing study, Product testing, Brand awareness, Market segmentation, and Trade-off analysis ;Quantitative Techniques MaxDiff (Concept testing w/ monadic randomization), CSat & NPS score (Customer experience study), Van Westendorp pricing (Pricing study), Conjoint analysis (CBC) (Trade-off analysis), & Two-step cluster & K-means cluster analysis (Market segmentation) ;Advanced Data Analysis Techniques (Not to get confused with data analytics) Driver analysis (Linear regression), Factor analysis (EFA), and Perceptual mapping  Recent trends affecting marketing research education  Job Specialization. There is evidence that modern professional jobs are rapidly being disaggregated and becoming increasingly specialized. While management of the marketing mix will continue to be overseen by generalists broadly trained in business and/or marketing, this trend towards specialization is creating new opportunities for professionals with focal training in the area of market research and the closely related area of consumer behaviour. The current and future job prospects for these market research specialists are highly attractive. For example, in the United States by 2018 jobs in Market and Survey Research are expected to grow to 350,500 as compared to 197,500 jobs for Marketing Managers, 43,900 jobs for Advertising and Promotion Managers and 64,100 jobs for Public Relations Managers. These two trends‚Äîspecialization of professional jobs, and high demand in the labor market for market research specialists‚Äîsuggest an increasing importance for post-graduate training designed to provide a gateway for university graduates seeking to pursue careers in the areas of market research and consumer behavior. Consumer Behavior Research by behavioral and neural scientists continue to make large contributions to our understanding of human decision making, and their findings are exerting a strong influence on the nature of marketing and market research. As companies struggle in a new world of \\"big data\\" and social media such as Twitter and Facebook, companies are facing increasing challenges in collecting, analyzing and interpreting this data to better understand their customers. This suggests that consumer behavior and Customer insight will likely play an increasing role in the work of market researchers.  Careers in marketing research  Careers in marketing research are divided mainly into two types supplier organization and client organization. Supplier side jobs are purely consulting jobs which are very similar in nature with management consulting jobs. Nielsen Corporation formerly known as AC Nielsen is the biggest supplier in the business followed by Kantar Group, Ipsos, GfK etc. ;Supplier organization Supplier organization is multiple domain organization where MR graduates focus on multiple domains of industry. Depending upon the client requirements research is designed and executed. Most of the MR graduates work as statistician, analyst, account executive, field work director etc. Supplier organization work in similar nature to that of management consulting. ;Client organization Client organization single domain organization where MR graduate focuses completely on a single domain of industry. The various organizations which recruit MR graduates are in the domain of telecom, food processing, aviation, retail chain, media etc. The positions for which they recruit are director, assistant research director, senior analyst, analyst etc. Many supplier side consultants seek full-time employment with the clients they advise during their tenure in the supplier organization.  Job & Placements Scenarios  With the increase in demand of marketing researchers there has been a surge in number of jobs available in research. Increasing number of suppliers have also increased the number of positions available in market. Most placements take place through alumni networks which benefits the graduate candidates to secure job before graduation. Most companies do recruit US citizens, but very few recruit international candidate due to visa sponsorship conditions. Other reasons would be qualitative work in research and abundance of available resources for recruitment. International candidate is required to evaluate all criteria's and information before embarking on tenure for the graduate program. Prospective international candidates should take the initiative to talk to program director regarding international student placement before enrolling into the program. A list of number of international students enrollments and international students placements would be helpful to evaluate the strength of the program.

She was his muse and is commemorated in his Sentimental Journey and Journal to Eliza. She had literary talents which were developed under Sterne's influence and she wrote many long and interesting letters from India, vividly describing the life and customs there. Early life Eliza was born Elizabeth Sclater at Anjengo, India, on 5 April 1744. She was the eldest daughter of May Sclater and his wife Judith Whitehill, daughter of Charles Whitehill. Her father was in the service of the East India Company. He died in 1746, and her mother probably by 1748, and the three daughters then lived with their grandfather, Charles Whitehill, at Bombay.Sclater, pp. 5‚Äì7 In 1754, the girls were sent to a boarding school in England, spending the holidays with their uncle and aunt, Thomas and Elizabeth Pickering.Sclater, p. 10 Eliza and her sisters returned to their grandfather in Bombay in 1757.Sclater, p. 14 Marriage Eliza was married at the age of 14 to Daniel Draper (1726‚Äì1805), a son of William Henry Draper, on 27 July 1758. Her husband was a cousin of General Sir William Draper, who captured Manila. Eliza had two children, a son born in 1759, who died in England nine years later, and a daughter, Elizabeth, born in 1761. Her sister Mary married Rawson Hart Boddam and her sister Louise married Colonel Charles Pemble.Sclater, pp. 18‚Äì37 In 1765 the Drapers visited England, bringing their children home to be educated. When Daniel returned to Bombay in 1766, Eliza stayed in England. Early in 1767, when staying at the house in Soho of her friend, Mrs. James, wife of Commodore, afterwards Sir William James, she met the novelist Laurence Sterne.Sclater, p. 45 Laurence Sterne Laurence Sterne by Joshua Reynolds Sterne was quickly captivated by Eliza's charm, vivacity and intelligence. Her upbringing had not instilled discretion; her self-esteem was flattered, and she did little to discourage the attentions of such a celebrated man. They met frequently, exchanged miniature portraits, and Sterne's admiration seems to have turned into an obsession which he took no trouble to conceal. To his great distress Eliza had to return to India three months after their first meeting.Sclater, p. 52 After her departure, Sterne brought out in his Sentimental Journey, which contains some extravagant references to her and, although their relationship was platonic, it aroused considerable interest. He also wrote his Journal to Eliza, part of which he sent to her, and the rest of which came to light when it was presented to the British Museum in 1894. Sterne died from consumption a year later without seeing her again.Sclater, p. 56 Sterne, calling himself Yorick, and addressing Eliza as Bramine, maintained a correspondence until Sterne's death. After Sterne's death his letters were to be published. Eliza succeeded in suppressing her letters to him and allowed ten of his letters to be published under the title Letters from Yorick to Eliza. Marital breakdown Eliza left her children in England with her grandfather, Charles Whitehill, who was now living in retirement at Worfield, Shropshire, and sailed to Bombay to join her husband. On the journey her cabin companion was Hester Light, who was to marry George Stratton.Sclater, p. 59 Eliza's husband held the post of Accountant-General at Bombay. In the following year he was sent to Tellicherry as Chief of the Factory after a dispute with the new Governor Thomas Hodges,Sclater, p. 73 and she accompanied him. In 1770 they were transferred to Surat,Sclater, pp. 116 returning to Bombay in 1772.Sclater, p. 126 Here Eliza and her husband became increasingly estranged. Besides keeping native women he seduced Eliza's English maid.Sclater, p. 155, p.165 The final break came in January 1773 when, after discovering this, Eliza fled from his house and took refuge for a time on board HMS Prudent in the protection of the Commodore Sir John Clarke.Sclater, pp. 149 She never saw her husband again. The marriage was not dissolved and Eliza kept custody of her daughter. Independence Guillaume Raynal Eliza lived for a year in India with her uncle John Whitehill, then Chief at Masulipatnam and afterwards Governor of Madras.Sclater, p. 154 She was back in England in 1774 for her health. She was living at 3 Queen Anne Street, London, a street where many literary figures dwelled,Sclater, p.173 and was joined by her sixteen-year-old daughter. Eliza became popular in literary society, being on friendly terms with John Wilkes among others.Sclater, pp. 167‚Äì174 In 1778 she met and made a profound impression upon the Abb√© Raynal.Sclater, p.178 She provided him with much technical information for his Histoire des deux Indes, and he was clearly smitten by her. After her death, he wrote a fulsome tribute to her which began in translation \\"Territory of Anjengo, thou art nothing; but thou hast given birth to Eliza\\". He went on in such terms: \\"The men were wont to say, that no woman had so many graces as Eliza: the women said so too.

Despite his not being a professional psychiatrist, people come to him for psychiatric treatment because of his special interest and knowledge in parapsychology. Later he was expelled from the University. Misir Ali is intelligent and often seen solving mysteries, although never accepting money for them. He is a logical person and doesn't believe in any paranormal activities. He has a personal diary named 'UNSOLVED,' in which he writes about those mysteries not solved by him. He is dark, tall and thin but in another story it was mentioned that he is short. He always lives in a small flat with a servant. Most of the time those servants are seen to be running away by stealing his money. His age in 'Nishithini' was 41 and in 'Misir Ali's \\"Aumimaangsito Rauhosso\\" his age is 51. He has a nephew named Amita. His mother died when he was two years old. His father was a Hujur (Muslim priest), who died when he was in class five. He grew up in his relatives' house. He is a chain smoker, but in every story he tries to quit. Every times he gets a letter he reads it three times. He is attracted to a girl named Nilu who was his university student. He is unmarried but in the story 'Onnobhuvon' only it was mentioned that he married Nilu. The movie adaptation of the first book of the series (Debi) directed by Anam Biswas, starring Chanchal Chowdhury as Misir Ali and Jaya Ahsan as Ranu was released in October, 2018. The movie received widely positive reviews from fans and critics alike. Books There are three parts of books that are available for the Misir Ali series. Among these 20 books there are 10 novels.

He began working at the IVPP in 1962, studying under Yang Zhongjian, who was director at the time. He has described fossil remains of many dinosaurs. He investigated and described the Dashanpu Formations; an important contribution to science since they are composed of Middle Jurassic beds which do not commonly yield fossils. Early life and education Dong Zhiming was born in January 1937 in Weihai, Shandong. At the age of 13, Dong was introduced to dinosaurs by a museum exhibit showcasing hadrosaur fossils. Dong graduated from university in 1962 with a degree in biology. Career After graduating, Dong Zhiming began working at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing where he was mentored by Yang Zhongjian, the \\"father of Chinese vertebrate palaeontology\\". Yang had helped initiate the formal study of fossils in China during the 1920s and continued to lead the field of Chinese palaeontology even after cooperation with foreign institutions ended in 1949. More than a decade later, he no longer participated in field work but was willing to take on Dong as a student, particularly after Dong made it clear he was interested in researching more challenging subjects like dinosaurs as opposed to invertebrates, for which fossils were more abundant and easily transported. Over the next three years Dong authored roughly 600 academic papers in both English and Mandarin. Dong participated in his first field expedition in 1963, aged 26, when he was part of a seven-person team sent by the IVPP to a site 180 miles outside √úr√ºmqi, Xinjiang. On this expedition, Dong discovered fossils of a sauropod dinosaur. =Dashanpu bone beds= Shaximiao Formation outcropping at the Zigong Dinosaur Museum Dong Zhiming's palaeontology research halted in 1965 when he became one of many academics ordered to participate in the Down to the Countryside Movement, which saw him and 17 million other privileged youth in China sent to work on farms across the country. Dong worked on a farm in Henan for one year and returned to Beijing just as the Cultural Revolution was beginning. With the IVPP all but shut down, he was reassigned to work on geological surveys in southwestern China where he helped design irrigation systems. Nonetheless, his mentor Yang continued to study palaeontology and met with Dong often, encouraging him to continue his research in addition to his work for the state. Yang also returned to field work during this time, including a 1975 expedition in which he investigated reports of fossils being found by road crews in the town of Dashanpu, Sichuan. Around this time, Dong petitioned the government to reinstate the IVPP's journal - Vertebrata PalAsiatica - and returned to work at the IVPP. One of Dong's first missions after returning to palaeontology was to follow up on Yang's finds at Dashanpu, and in 1976 he discovered the first dinosaur fossils dating to the Middle Jurassic that had ever been found in China. Although this represented a monumental discovery, it would be the last he shared with his mentor: Yang Zhongjian died on 15 January 1979. As international tensions eased, Dong Zhiming began to cooperate with international researchers in addition to Chinese scientists. After the discovery of fossils at Dashanpu by both him and Yang, Dong returned to the township in 1980 accompanied by a team of scientists from the British Museum. Being familiar with the area, Dong elected to begin their search for fossils at a construction site for a planned natural gas facility which had excavated the top of a nearby hill, and after entering the site he and his colleagues discovered an unexpected treasure trove of fossils. Dong and his team worked to end the construction on the hill, and by autumn the local government agreed to end development at Dashanpu despite having already invested over one million yuan into the project. Dong's research at the site would lead to the formal description of the Shaximiao Formation and the preservation of over 15,000 ft2 of dinosaur-bearing bone bed as part of the Zigong Dinosaur Museum. =China-Canada Dinosaur Project= As work was underway preserving and studying the bone beds at Dashanpu, China entered into a period of political and economic reform. Accompanied by Sun Ailing, Dong Zhiming visited Alberta, Canada in November 1985. Both a scientific and diplomatic mission, their visit helped initiate the China- Canada Dinosaur Project (CCDP). With $15 million CAD worth of funding, the mission was one of the largest ever mounted in the history of palaeontology and was the first major show of cooperation between Chinese and foreign palaeontologists since 1949. As an international collaboration, Dong Zhiming represented the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology as one of the project's three leaders; his two co-leaders were Philip J. Currie of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology and Dale Russell of the Canadian Museum of Nature. The China-Canada Dinosaur Project lasted four field seasons, beginning in May 1986 and ending in 1991. As many as fifty researchers were at work in the field at one time. Expeditions related to the project were undertaken in sites within both countries' borders, including the Canadian Arctic and the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang. In the Junggar Basin, Dong impressed his Canadian colleagues by using dynamite to clear tonnes of overburden without damaging important fossils that had been spotted underneath; these fossils would later become the holotype for Mamenchisaurus sinocanadorum, named in honour of the CCDP. More than 11 new species of dinosaur were described as a result of the CCDP, including a new genus of theropod discovered by Dong in 1987; this dinosaur was later named Sinraptor dongi in his honour. =Later career= On the advice of his late mentor, Dong Zhiming continued his research into palaeontology with a focus on locating fossils that bridge known periods of dinosaur evolution and explain the gaps in- between. In the 1980s he sparked controversy by suggesting that fossils of the dinosaur Segnosaurus and its relatives belonged to a new order of dinosaur: Segnosaurischia. Historically, all dinosaurs have been categorized as belonging to either the order Ornithischia or Saurischia, and Dong's suggestion of a third order sparked controversy. American palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul offered his support for Dong's theory in 1984, but that Segnosaurus represented evidence not of a third order of dinosaurs but instead that all dinosaurs belonged to a single order. Ultimately, further research into both Segnosaurus and Therizinosaurus proved that the latter was a theropod and that the two belonged to the same order, and so the dinosaurs once proposed as belonging to Segnosaurischia were assigned to the order Saurischia. However, Dong continued to push this third-order theory as late as 2008, shortly before his retirement. In a 1988 paper authored by Dong and translated into English by Angela Milner, he argued that legendary descriptions of dragon bones in the I Ching and other ancient works could be attributed to Chinese farmers uncovering and misidentifying dinosaur fossils. During his field work, Dong also occasionally encountered modern farmers who believed that large dinosaur fossils were the remains of dragons, and had to convince them otherwise in order to acquire the fossils for study. Along with co-author Paul Sereno, Dong reviewed his initial description of Huayangosaurus, an ankylosaurid he'd discovered in Dashanpu in 1979 and described in 1982. This 1992 review saw Dong and Sereno determine that Huayangosaurus had a parasacral spine, or a vertebral column which ran adjacent to the sacrum; and that the animal's heightened pedicles may have helped keep its dorsal plates in place without ossified tendons to hold them upright. Contributions and recognition Mounted skeleton of Sinraptor dongi Dong Zhiming has discovered and described more than 42 genera of dinosaurs, of which 27 are still considered valid. A 2008 study found that Dong ranked fourth on a list of people responsible for naming the most dinosaurs; however, when only valid names were counted Dong ranked first, meaning he has named more species of dinosaur than anyone else in history. While most of Dong's names are still considered valid some have been reassigned to other families. One such example is Micropachycephalosaurus, named by Dong for its apparent relationship to the better-known Pachycephalosaurus, a link that other scientists were less inclined to believe. Studies by Richard J. Butler, Qi Zhao, and other researchers cast doubt on Dong's placement of Micropachycephalosaurus, and in 2011 the genus was reassigned to the suborder Ceratopsia. Dong is known among the palaeontological community for giving the dinosaurs he describes unusual names, such as T. nedegoapeferima, where the specific name is derived from each of the main cast members from the 1993 film Jurassic Park in recognition of a $25,000 USD donation to the IVPP by American director Steven Spielberg. Likewise, the name he gave the genus Gasosaurus translates to \\"gas lizard\\", and ostensibly refers to the natural gas plant which was meant to be built on the Dashanpu hilltop where its fossils were discovered. In addition to this obvious meaning, the Mandarin word for \\"gas\\" can also be translated as \\"making trouble\\", an apparent reference to Zhiming's struggle with local authorities to preserve the fossil bone beds. Dong is considered an instrumental part of the reason that China has such an array of known stegosaurid species. In the 2012 textbook The Complete Dinosaur (co- authored by researchers M. K. Brett-Surman, Thomas R. Holtz Jr., and James O. Farrow), Dong and his mentor Yang Zhongjian are praised for their efforts to advance palaeontology's understanding of stegosaurids: > Although the fossil record of stegosaurs for most of Asia is very > fragmentary (Averianov et al. 2007; Maidment 2010), that of the People's > Republic of China is the longest and most diverse (see Dong 1990, 1992; > Olshevsky and Ford 1993; Galton and Upchurch 2004; Maidment et al. 2008; > Maidment 2010). A partial skeleton of Chialingosaurus was described by Chung > Chien Young (1958) from the Shangshaximiao Formation of Sichuan and, thanks > to the efforts of Zhimin Dong, additional parts of this skeleton plus > skeletons of two additional genera, Chungkingosaurus and Tuojiangosaurus, > are also known (Dong et al. 1983; Peng et al. 2005). One of Dong's co-leaders on the China-Canada Dinosaur Project, Dale Russell, once claimed that Dong was the best fossil hunter he'd ever met, saying: > On any day of collecting, Dong will have two or three times as many as > anyone else. The metriacanthosaurid Sinraptor dongi, discovered during the China-Canada Dinosaur Project, was named for Dong Zhiming in 1994. Personal life While working as a surveyor in southwest China in the late 1960s, Dong married IVPP palaeoanthropologist Chen Dezhen. The two have two adult children who were raised by their grandparents while Dong and Chen pursued their careers. The couple lived in an apartment on the IVPP campus in Beijing before retiring to Yunnan in 2008.

This building has since been demolished, but during his day the printshop window was crowded with caricatures. The Times of 7 May 1832 reports: :On Saturday morning, about 11 o ºclock, as a boy named William Gunton, son of a watch-spring-maker, No. 3 City-gardens, was standing at the corner of Wood-street, looking at a caricature-shop window, a wagon in passing caught his arm between the stump (put up by the city for protection) and nearly severed it from the body. He was immediately taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and the arm was amputated. There is every possibility of his recovery. The corner of Wood- street is rendered exceedingly dangerous by the exhibition of caricatures, as it invariably induces a crowd to assemble round the shop. On the Saturday previous, a gentleman named Bragge nearly lost his life, within a few yards of the same spot, and numerous robberies are continually occurring. A policeman was subsequently stationed on the corner and Tregear forced to reduce the number of prints displayed. In 1834 he moved to 96 Cheapside, where he worked until his death in 1841. He died on 21 February 1841, at 18 Goulden Terrace, Islington, of influenza, and was buried at St. Martin in the Fields in Camden Town. His widow continued to operate the business with Thomas Crump Lewis as Tregear & Lewis, also selling musical instruments. The firm went bankrupt in 1844. Tregear published many series, of which Flights of Humour appears to be the longest, running to 95 prints or more. They are generally undated. The \\"Rum Jokes\\" series ran to at least 43 prints, and cover hunting, shooting, and fishing, plus racing events, skating, billiards and the building trade. His \\"Black Jokes\\" were described in an advertisement as \\"being a Series of Laughable Caricatures on the March of Manners Amongst the Blacks.\\" Tregear's Black Jokes Produced from drawings by a W. Summers (and etched by a certain Hunt in the case of numbers 7 and 16 and perhaps others), these caricatures of black life included about 19 images, of which the following are known: *\\"No. 3: Marriage √† la Mode;\\" *\\"No. 4: The Christening;\\" *\\"No. 6: The Route;\\" *\\"No. 7: The Card Party\\" *\\"No. 8: The Breaking Up;\\" *\\"No. 9: The Promenade;\\" *\\"No. 10: The Concert;\\" *\\"No. 11: Miss White's Birth-day Party;\\" *\\"No. 12: The Lubber Quarrel;\\" *\\"No. 15: Cinderella and the Black Prince;\\" *\\"No. 16: The Portrait\\" *\\"No. 18: The Advertisement;\\" *and \\"No. 19: The Wedding Feast.\\" The series was published in 1834.

Witham (Somerset) railway station was a station serving the Somerset village of Witham Friary and was located on the Frome to Yeovil section of the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway that opened in 1856.Somerset Railway Stations, Mike Oakley, Dovecote Press, Wimborne, 2002. In 1858, the East Somerset Railway opened a branch line from Witham first to Shepton Mallet and then, in 1862, to Wells; in 1870, this line linked up to the Bristol and Exeter Railway branch from Yatton to Wells, the Cheddar Valley line, and through services began. All of these railways were allied to, and were eventually subsumed within, the Great Western Railway. The Westbury, Wiltshire to Castle Cary section of the WS&WR; also later formed part of the GWR's new express route to South-West England, avoiding Swindon, Bath and Bristol, that opened in 1906. Witham station was known as \\"Witham\\" for most of its life, but was renamed \\"Witham (Somerset)\\" under British Railways to avoid confusion with the town (and station) of the same name in Essex. Passenger services on the Yatton to Witham line through Cheddar, Wells and Shepton Mallet were withdrawn in 1963 under the Beeching Axe. The station retained services on the WS&WR; route until 1966, when it was one of several village stations on the line to close. The station buildings have now been demolished. The junction at Witham remains and has been heavily used for freight trains carrying stone from Merehead Quarry, just off the East Somerset line at Quarry Junction. Part of the East Somerset Railway has also been re-opened as a heritage railway, starting at Cranmore. Today, the Reading to Taunton Line passes through the site of the station.

Route Paris-Soissons-Laon-La Capelle-Belgium (N 6) History The N 2 was initially defined in 1811 as route imp√©riale 2, running from Paris all the way to Amsterdam via Brussels, Antwerp, Breda and Utrecht. The territory north of the present border with Belgium was removed from France in the 1815 Congress of Vienna, and thus route 2 was truncated to that line. In 1824 it was renamed route royale 2, and in 1830 it became route nationale 2. The former path to Amsterdam is now the N6 and N1 in Belgium and the N263 and unnumbered roads paralleling the A27 and A2 in the Netherlands. Description of Route =Paris to Soissons (0 km to 100 km)= The RN 2 starts at the Porte de la Villette in north-east Paris. Called the Avenue Jean Jaur√®s to Le Bourget crossing the A 86 autoroute and then A 1 autoroute (Paris to Lille). The road passes the A√©roport de Paris - Le Bourget. Where it turns east leaving the N 17. The road then crosses the A 1 and A 3 autoroute. The N 2 merges with the A 104 autoroute briefly as it passes south east of Charles de Gaulle Airport. The original road ran through the airport site and is designated by the D 902 to the south and D 401 through Dammartin-en-Go√´le. The road now by-passes many of the villages and small towns on the original route such as Nanteuil-le- Haudouin. The road then passes through the For√™t de Retz. The road passes open country and war cemeteries to the town of Soissons on the river Aisne. The road crosses the N 31 (Rouen to Reims). =Soissons to Laon (100 km to 130 km)= North of the town the countryside is more wooded the road passes the Monument des Crapouillots. The road reaches the ridge on which the walled town of Laon sits. The road crosses the N 44 (Reims to Cambrai). =Laon to Maubeuge (130 km to 224 km)= The road heads north east over the A 26 autoroute (Calais to Troyes). The countryside is now flat and open. The road turns north after the small town of Vervins. The road then crosses the upper reaches of the Oise. At La Capelle the road meets the N 29 to Le Havre and the N 43 (Calais to Metz). The countryside becomes more hilly on its way to Avesnes-sur-Helpe. At Maubeuge the road crosses the river Sambre, and also the N 49 (Valenciennes to Belgium). The road continues north to the frontier with Belgium and Mons becoming the N 6.

His research focuses on the development of novel techniques for the detection and characterization of exoplanets orbiting nearby, Sun-like stars.  Early life and education  David Charbonneau was born in Ottawa, Ontario. He is the son of Brian Charbonneau, a geologist, and Sylvia Charbonneau, a physician. When he was around 12 years old, he visited Pacific Rim National Park with his family, where he spent time playing in tide pools and observing the variety of organisms that lived in the intertidal zone. He credits this experience with sparking an early interest in science. When he was in high school, he read Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time. Intrigued by the ideas in the book, he decided to pursue studies in physics and astronomy, rather than biology. Charbonneau received a Bachelor of Science degree in math, physics, and astronomy from the University of Toronto in 1996. At the suggestion of his friend Sara Seager, he applied to the graduate program in astronomy at Harvard University and was accepted. As a graduate student in 1999, he used a 4-inch telescope to make the first detection of an exoplanet eclipsing (or transiting) its parent star, which yielded the first ever constraint on the composition of a planet outside the Solar system. He earned a PhD in astronomy in 2001. In 2004, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific awarded him the Robert J. Trumpler Award for his graduate thesis entitled Shadows and Reflections of Extrasolar Planets.  Career  Charbonneau was a R. A. Millikan Postdoctoral Scholar in Astronomy at the California Institute of Technology from 2001 until 2004. He returned to Harvard in 2004 where he joined the faculty of the Department of Astronomy. Charbonneau was a founding member of the Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey, which used a worldwide network of humble automated telescopes to survey hundreds of thousands of stars to detect 5 more exoplanets by this technique. Charbonneau also pioneered the use of space-based observatories to undertake the first studies of the atmospheres of these distant worlds: In 2001 he used the Hubble Space Telescope to study directly the chemical make-up of the atmosphere enshrouding one of these exoplanets, and in 2005, he led the team that used the Spitzer Space Telescope to make the first direct detection of the light emitted by an exoplanet. He is currently leading the NSF-funded MEarth Project and is a member of the NASA Kepler Mission Team. Each of these projects aims to detect Earth-like planets that might be suitable abodes for life beyond the Solar system. Awards and honors *Robert J. Trumpler Award (2004) *Alfred P.

The ambient construction is canonical in the sense that it is performed only using the conformal class of the metric: it is conformally invariant. However, the construction only works asymptotically, up to a certain order of approximation. There is, in general, an obstruction to continuing this extension past the critical order. The obstruction itself is of tensorial character, and is known as the (conformal) obstruction tensor. It is, along with the Weyl tensor, one of the two primitive invariants in conformal differential geometry. Aside from the obstruction tensor, the ambient construction can be used to define a class of conformally invariant differential operators known as the GJMS operators.Graham, R., Jenne, R., Mason, L.J., and Sparling, G.A.J. \\"Conformally invariant powers of the Laplacian I: Existence\\", Jour. Lond. Math. Soc, 46 (1992), 557-565. A related construction is the tractor bundle. Overview The model flat geometry for the ambient construction is the future null cone in Minkowski space, with the origin deleted. The celestial sphere at infinity is the conformal manifold M, and the null rays in the cone determine a line bundle over M. Moreover, the null cone carries a metric which degenerates in the direction of the generators of the cone. The ambient construction in this flat model space then asks: if one is provided with such a line bundle, along with its degenerate metric, to what extent is it possible to extend the metric off the null cone in a canonical way, thus recovering the ambient Minkowski space? In formal terms, the degenerate metric supplies a Dirichlet boundary condition for the extension problem and, as it happens, the natural condition is for the extended metric to be Ricci flat (because of the normalization of the normal conformal connection.) The ambient construction generalizes this to the case when M is conformally curved, first by constructing a natural null line bundle N with a degenerate metric, and then solving the associated Dirichlet problem on N √ó (-1,1). Details This section provides an overview of the construction, first of the null line bundle, and then of its ambient extension. =The null line bundle= Suppose that M is a conformal manifold, and that [g] denotes the conformal metric defined on M. Let œÄ : N -> M denote the tautological subbundle of T*M ‚äó T*M defined by all representatives of the conformal metric. In terms of a fixed background metric g0, N consists of all positive multiples œâ2g0 of the metric. There is a natural action of R+ on N, given by :\\\\delta_\\\\omega g = \\\\omega^2 g Moreover, the total space of N carries a tautological degenerate metric, for if p is a point of the fibre of œÄ : N -> M corresponding to the conformal representative gp, then let :h_p(X_p,Y_p) = g_p(\\\\pi_*X,\\\\pi_*Y). This metric degenerates along the vertical directions. Furthermore, it is homogeneous of degree 2 under the R+ action on N: :\\\\delta^*_\\\\omega h = \\\\omega^2 h Let X be the vertical vector field generating the scaling action. Then the following properties are immediate: :h(X,-) = 0 :LXh = 2h, where LX is the Lie derivative along the vector field X. =The ambient space= Let N~ = N √ó (-1,1), with the natural inclusion i : N -> N~. The dilations Œ¥œâ extend naturally to N~, and hence so does the generator X of dilation. An ambient metric on N~ is a Lorentzian metric h~ such that * The metric is homogeneous: Œ¥œâ* h~ = œâ2 h~ * The metric is an ambient extension: i* h~ = h, where i* is the pullback along the natural inclusion. * The metric is Ricci flat: Ric(h~) = 0. Suppose that a fixed representative of the conformal metric g and a local coordinate system x = (xi) are chosen on M. These induce coordinates on N by identifying a point in the fibre of N with (x,t2g(x)) where t > 0 is the fibre coordinate. (In these coordinates, X = t ‚àÇt.) Finally, if œÅ is a defining function of N in N~ which is homogeneous of degree 0 under dilations, then (x,t,œÅ) are coordinates of N~. Furthermore, any extension metric which is homogeneous of degree 2 can be written in these coordinates in the form: :h^\\\\sim = t^2 g_{ij}(x,\\\\rho)dx^idx^j+2\\\\rho dt^2+2tdtd\\\\rho,\\\\, where the gij are n2 functions with g(x,0) = g(x), the given conformal representative. After some calculation one shows that the Ricci flatness is equivalent to the following differential equation, where the prime is differentiation with respect to œÅ: :\\\\rho g_{ij}-\\\\rho g^{kl}g_{ik}'g_{jl}+\\\\tfrac12\\\\rho g^{kl}g_{kl}'g_{ij}'+\\\\frac{2-n}{2}g_{ij}'-\\\\tfrac12 g^{kl}g_{kl}'g_{ij}+\\\\mathrm{Ric}(g)_{ij}=0. One may then formally solve this equation as a power series in œÅ to obtain the asymptotic development of the ambient metric off the null cone. For example, substituting œÅ = 0 and solving gives :gij‚Ä≤(x,0) = 2Pij where P is the Schouten tensor. Next, differentiating again and substituting the known value of gij‚Ä≤(x,0) into the equation, the second derivative can be found to be a multiple of the Bach tensor. And so forth.

After two years where he rarely played, he moved to another club in the Eredivisie, Fortuna Sittard, where he would remain the following seven years; during his first ten professional campaigns (one with Fortuna was spent in the second division), he did not miss a single game. After three seasons with Roda JC, Hesp signed with Spanish side FC Barcelona as the Catalans were being managed by countryman Louis van Gaal, also newly-signed. He easily beat competition from Portuguese V√≠tor Ba√≠a, playing in 73 out of 76 possible La Liga matches as Bar√ßa won back-to-back leagues (in 1998, the double befell). In his last season at the Camp Nou, Hesp split first-choice status with youth graduate Francesc Arnau, then moved back to the Netherlands and Fortuna, retiring at almost 37 in 2002.

Coming into politics through local government in West Yorkshire, Woolmer was elected to Parliament for the Labour Party in 1979. He became an effective Parliamentarian and was rapidly promoted, despite clearly allying to the party's right-wing and playing an active role in the intra-party conflict. Partly due to adverse boundary changes, he lost his seat in 1983 and was unable to win it back. Later in life he received a life peerage and was an active member of the House of Lords. Early career Woolmer was the son of Joseph Woolmer, and was educated at Kettering Grammar School, moving on to the University of Leeds where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics; after graduating he became a university lecturer at Leeds. His political career began in 1970 when he was elected as a Labour Party candidate to Leeds city council, of which he was deputy leader from 1972. In 1973 Woolmer was elected to the new Leeds city council and to West Yorkshire county council which had been created as part of local government reorganisation.\\"Dod's Parliamentary Companion, 1983\\", p. 520. At the 1970 Labour Party conference, Woolmer (as the delegate from Leeds North West Constituency Labour Party) seconded a motion calling for abolition of all private medicine.\\"Private insurance schemes seen as threat to health service\\", The Times, 2 October 1970, p. 4. See also \\"Report of the Sixty-Ninth Annual Conference of the Labour Party\\", p. 233. That year he fought Leeds North West at the general election, coming second. West Yorkshire county council As deputy leader and chairman of the planning and transport committee of West Yorkshire county council, Woolmer announced in July 1974 the beginning of a campaign for industrial and commercial development.Ronald Kershaw, \\"West Yorkshire plans big autumn campaign to boost industrial growth\\", The Times, 29 July 1974, p. 16. In 1976 he called for Government support for electronics industries which were locating in West Yorkshire, after a Rank Radio factory made 200 workers redundant.Ronald Kershaw, \\"Rank blow to West Yorkshire jobs\\", The Times, 26 April 1976, p. 16. Woolmer was chairman of the planning and transportation committee of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities from 1974 to 1977, and later became Leader of West Yorkshire county council. 1979 election By the late summer of 1976, Woolmer had been selected to follow Dr Alfred Broughton as Labour Party candidate for Batley and Morley.See F. W. S. Craig & E. P. Craig, \\"The Political Companion\\", Parliamentary Research Services, No. 24 (Summer/Autumn 1976), p. 97. Broughton suffered prolonged ill health during the later stages of the Parliament but did not resign his seat; he died just as the 1979 general election campaign began. Woolmer was elected with a majority of 5,352.\\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1979\\", p. 44. In Parliament Woolmer specialised in issues affecting the economy and industry. He became a member of the Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service when it was set up, and chaired the Parliamentary Labour Party finance and economic committee in 1980‚Äì81. Economic policy In responding to the recession of the early 1980s, Woolmer pressed the Government to use the proceeds of North Sea oil to build up manufacturing industry,\\"Sensible pay deals aid competitiveness\\", The Times, 21 March 1980, p. 10. and he challenged Margaret Thatcher to accept that her policies were causing a divide between the industrial north and the prosperous south.\\"The money is there but why do so many buy foreign?\\", The Times, 2 July 1980, p. 12. He attacked the 1981 budget as \\"savagely deflationary\\", asserting that it would \\"pile agony on to injury\\".\\"Budget critics misunderstand basic objective\\", The Times, 14 April 1981, p. 10. Woolmer also took up the cause of civil servants' pay, urging the Government to take the matter to arbitration.\\"Militants urged not to extend action\\", The Times, 4 June 1981, p. 8. Solidarity After a special conference of the Labour Party endorsed an electoral college for future elections of the party leader, Woolmer signed a statement deploring the outcome. He volunteered as Secretary of Solidarity, a group which campaigned against the far left within the Labour Party and to stop further defections to the Social Democratic Party.Dianne Hayter, \\"Fightback! Labour's traditional right in 1970s and 1980s\\", Manchester University Press, 2005, p. 131-2. Leader of the Opposition Michael Foot promoted Woolmer to the front bench as junior spokesman on trade, prices and consumer protection from November 1981; it was noted that he was not a left-winger in Labour Party terms.\\"Six MPs promoted to Foot's front bench\\", The Times, 28 November 1981, p. 2. Woolmer joined a pressure group called \\"Forward Labour\\" which was set up in 1982 calling for evidence of Militant tendency infiltration of the Labour Party to be published, with a view to expelling their members.Paul Routledge, \\"Labour pressure group aims to expose militants\\", The Times, 10 April 1982, p. 2. In his front bench role, Woolmer pressed the Government not to allow British Airways (then in state ownership) to sell off profitable subsidiaries, which he believed to be a prelude to its privatisation.\\"Aviation Government want BA profitable and privatized\\", The Times, 11 May 1982, p. 4. Defeat When Woolmer came up for re-election at the 1983 general election, his constituency was divided in boundary changes and Woolmer stood for the new Batley and Spen seat which was less favourable for the Labour Party.It was estimated that, had the new seat voted at the 1979 election, Labour would have led the Conservatives by 3.1% of the vote. In the actual 1979 results, Woolmer had led the Conservative candidate by 11.4%. This made Batley and Spen the 23rd smallest majority in a Labour held seat. See \\"The BBC/ITN Guide to the New Parliamentary Constituencies\\", Parliamentary Research Services, 1983, p. 26, 154. After a close fight, Woolmer lost the seat by 870 votes to the Conservative Elizabeth Peacock.\\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1983\\", p. 42. His loss from the House of Commons was described as \\"unexpected\\" by Gerald Kaufman, who particularly regretted it because Woolmer \\"had developed an impressive expertise in trade policy\\".Gerald Kaufman, \\"Farewell, but may you soon return\\", The Times, 13 June 1983, p. 10. Woolmer had been the principal of Halton Gill Associates, consultants on central and local government, since 1979.\\"Woolmer of Leeds, Baron\\", Who's Who 2009, A & C Black, 2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2008 accessed 17 July 2009 In 1985 Woolmer was reselected to try to gain Batley and Spen back from the Conservatives.Robert Waller, \\"Labour's new faces for the 1990s\\", The Times, 17 July 1985. At the 1987 general election, he was again defeated as the Conservatives slightly increased their majority; it was speculated that a large personal vote for the sitting Conservative MP had kept the seat in her hands.David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh, \\"The British General Election of 1987\\", Macmillan, 1987, p. 334. Subsequent business career In 1991 Woolmer became Director of MBA Programmes for Leeds University; he also served as a director of Leeds United F.C. from 1991 to 1996. He was briefly Dean of External Relations for the university in 1997 before becoming Dean of the School of Business and Economic Studies; he oversaw the creation of a separate Leeds University Business School before leaving in 2000. He has been a partner in Anderson McGraw since 2001 and was a non-executive director of Thornfield Developments Ltd from 1999 to 2002, among other business appointments. Woolmer was created a Life Peer as Baron Woolmer of Leeds, of Leeds in the County of West Yorkshire in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 3 August 1999.

It was fought July 3, 1863, near Fairfield, Pennsylvania, concurrently with the Battle of Gettysburg, although it was not a formal part of that battle. While a minor fight by the small number of troops deployed, strategically, the Confederate victory secured the important Hagerstown Road, which Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia would use on July 5 to return to Maryland and then on to safety in Virginia. Background Fairfield had been the site of combat on June 21, when the 14th Virginia Cavalry of Brig. Gen. Albert Jenkins's mounted infantry brigade had used Monterey Pass to conduct a raid near Fairfield with the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry that resulted in the Confederates withdrawing into the Cumberland Valley. Much of the cavalry of the Army of Northern Virginia had accompanied Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart on his ride around the Union Army of the Potomac through Maryland and south-central Pennsylvania. Lee had retained several brigades to guard the mountain passes as he advanced through the Shenandoah and Cumberland Valleys and to scout Federal positions. Among the latter brigades was that of Brig. Gen. William E. \\"Grumble\\" Jonesthe celebrated \\"Laurel Brigade\\" that had once been commanded by Turner Ashby. Jones had detached one of his best commands, the 35th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, to accompany the infantry of Jubal Early, but retained the bulk of his command. Jones's Brigade had been raiding the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in West Virginia and Maryland before being recalled by Lee. They hastened to Pennsylvania, crossing the Potomac River on July 1 (where Jones detached the 12th Virginia Cavalry to guard the ford) and camping at Chambersburg the following night. Jones's force had been reduced to the 6th, 7th, and 11th Virginia Cavalry and Preston Chew's Battery of horse artillery. Jones reached Fairfield on July 3 in response to Lee's orders to secure the vital Hagerstown Road. Reports of a slow moving Confederate wagon train in the vicinity had attracted the attention of newly commissioned Union Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt, who ordered the 6th U.S. Cavalry under Maj. Samuel H. Starr to scout Fairfield and locate the wagons. Once in Fairfield, Major Starr learned that a wagon train had just rolled out of town and was heading to Cashtown. He divided his 400 men into three detachments and began to search for the wagons. Battle One party soon encountered the pickets of Jones's 7th Virginia Cavalry and withdrew when additional Confederates rode up.

George C. Platt, an Irish immigrant serving in Troop H of the 6th U.S. Cavalry, was awarded the Medal of Honor on July 12, 1895, for his actions at Fairfield. His citation reads, \\"Seized the regimental flag upon the death of the standard bearer in a hand-to-hand fight and prevented it from falling into the hands of the enemy.\\" His commander was Lt. Louis H. Carpender who was awarded the Medal of Honor in the Indian wars After the fighting had ended, many wounded soldiers were cared for in the town of Fairfield. Major Samuel H. Starr was taken to the widow Sarah Amanda Blythe's house, which is likely where his arm was amputated. Other accounts mention that the Rufus C.

Muiris √ì S√∫ileabh√°in ( anglicised as Maurice O'Sullivan), ; 19 February 1904 ‚Äì 25 June 1950), was an Irish author famous for his Irish- language memoir of growing up on the Great Blasket Island and in Dingle, County Kerry, off the western coast of Ireland. Writings Fiche Blian ag F√°s was published in Irish and English in 1933. As one of the last areas of Ireland in which the old Irish language and culture had continued unchanged, the Great Blasket Island was a place of enormous interest to those seeking traditional Irish narratives. √ì S√∫illeabh√°in was persuaded to write his memoirs by George Thomson, a linguist and professor of Greek who had come to the island to hear and learn the Irish language. It was Thomson who encouraged him to join the Gardai rather than emigrate to America as most of the young people did. Thomson edited and assembled the memoir, and arranged for its translation into English with the help of Moya Llewelyn Davies. While Fiche Blian ag F√°s was received with tremendous enthusiasm by critics, including E.M. Forster, their praise at times had a condescending tone. Forster described the book as a document of a surviving \\"Neolithic\\" culture. Such interest was tied up with romantic notions of the Irish primitive, and thus when √ì S√∫illeabh√°in tried to find a publisher for his second book, Fiche Bliain faoi Bhl√°th (in English, Twenty Years a-Flowering), there was little interest, as this narrative necessarily departed from the romantic realm of turf fires and pipe-smoking wise-women. Dylan Thomas commenced, but did not finish, a filmscript of Twenty Years a-Growing. Personal life Following the death of his mother when he was six months old, √ì S√∫illeabh√°in was raised in an institution in Dingle, Co. Kerry. Aged eight, he returned to Great Blasket Island to live with his father, grandfather and the rest of his siblings, and learnt the native language. He joined the Garda S√≠och√°na in Dublin in 1927 and was stationed in the Gaeltacht area of Connemara, where he kept up contact with Thomson.

Biography Born in London in 1924, Hawksworth initially trained as a pianist, but also played double bass for Britain's leading big band the Ted Heath Orchestra during the early 1950s and through the 1960s. During this time he became one of the most popular jazz bassists in the UK, winning many polls and was often featured as a soloist on Heath concerts and recordings.Metronome, Volume 73, p. 15 (1957). He is probably best known, however, for his short compositions for television. These include Salute to Thames (the famous identity tune for Thames Television) and also the theme tunes for the 1960s pop music show Thank Your Lucky Stars and the 1970s series Roobarb, Man About the House and George and Mildred. He also contributed some of the incidental music used in the 1967 Spider-Man cartoon (although originating from the United States, Spider-Man had most of its incidental music supplied by Irish composers, such as Phil Coulter, who was from Londonderry in Northern Ireland, and British including Syd Dale, Alan Hawkshaw, David Lindup, Bill Martin and Johnny Pearson.)Jon E.

Specifically it is used for ascariasis and hookworm infections. It is taken by mouth. Side effects may include abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. Use is not recommended during breastfeeding or the third trimester of pregnancy. Serious side effects may include an increased risk of infection. It belongs to the antihelmintic class of medications. Levamisole was discovered in 1966. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is not commercially available in the United States. Levamisole is also used as a dewormer for livestock. Medical uses =Worms= Levamisole was originally used as an anthelmintic to treat worm infestations in both humans and animals. Levamisole works as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist that causes continued stimulation of the parasitic worm muscles, leading to paralysis. In countries that still permit the use of levamisole, the recommended dose for anthelmintic therapy is a single dose, with a repeated dose 7 days later if needed for a severe hookworm infection. Most current commercial preparations are intended for veterinary use as a dewormer in cattle, pigs, and sheep. However, levamisole has also recently gained prominence among aquarists as an effective treatment for Camallanus roundworm infestations in freshwater tropical fish. =Cancer= After being pulled from the market in the U.S. and Canada in 1999 and 2003, respectively, levamisole has been tested in combination with fluorouracil to treat colon cancer. Evidence from clinical trials support its addition to fluorouracil therapy to benefit patients with colon cancer. In some of the leukemic cell line studies, both levamisole and tetramisole showed similar effect.(Chirigos et al. (1969, 1973, 1975)). =Other= Levamisole has been used to treat a variety of dermatologic conditions, including skin infections, leprosy, warts, lichen planus, and aphthous ulcers. An interesting adverse side effect these reviewers reported in passing was \\"neurologic excitement\\". Later papers, from the Janssen group and others, indicate levamisole and its enantiomer, dexamisole, have some mood-elevating or antidepressant properties, although this was never a marketed use of the drug.  Adverse effects  One of the more serious side effects of levamisole is agranulocytosis, or the depletion of the white blood cells. In particular, neutrophils appear to be affected the most. This occurs in 0.08‚Äì5% of the studied populations. There have also been reports of levamisole induced necrosis syndrome in which erythematous painful papules can appear almost anywhere on skin. It has been used as an adulterant in cocaine resulting in serious side effects.  Metabolism  Levamisole is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver. Its time to peak plasma concentration is 1.5‚Äì2 hours. The plasma elimination half- life is fairly quick at 3‚Äì4 hours which can contribute to not detecting Levamisole intoxication. The metabolite half-life is 16 hours. Levamisole's excretion is primarily through the kidneys, with about 70% being excreted over 3 days. Only about 5% is excreted as unchanged levamisole. Drug testing of racehorse urine has led to the revelation that among levamisole equine metabolites are both pemoline and aminorex, stimulants that are forbidden by racing authorities.J. Scarth et al. (2010) \\"The use of in vitro drug metabolism studies to complement, reduce and refine in vivo administrations in medication and doping control.\\" Proceedings of the 18th International Conference of Racing Analysts and Veterinarians. pp 213-222 Further testing confirmed aminorex in human and canine urine, meaning that both humans and dogs also metabolize levamisole into aminorex., though it is unclear whether plasma aminorex is present at any appreciable level. Blood samples following oral administration of levamisole out to 172 hr post-dose did not demonstrate any plasma aminorex levels above that of the limit of quantification (LoQ). Additionally, in cocaine-positive plasma samples, of which 42% contained levamisole, aminorex was never reported at concentrations higher than LoQ. Detection in body fluids Levamisole may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths involving adulterated street drugs. About 3% of an oral dose is eliminated unchanged in the 24-hour urine of humans. A post mortem blood levamisole concentration of 2.2 mg/L was present in a woman who died of a cocaine overdose.R. Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 9th edition, Biomedical Publications, Seal Beach, CA, 2011, pp.901-902. .  Adulterant in illegal drugs  Levamisole has increasingly been used as a cutting agent in cocaine sold around the globe with the highest incidence being in the USA. In 2008-2009, levamisole was found in 69% of cocaine samples seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). By April 2011, the DEA reported the adulterant was found in 82% of seizures. Levamisole adds bulk and weight to powdered cocaine (whereas other adulterants produce smaller \\"rocks\\" of cocaine) and makes the drug appear purer. In a series of investigative articles for The Stranger, Brendan Kiley details other rationales for levamisole's rise as an adulterant: possible stimulant effects, a similar appearance to cocaine, and an ability to pass street purity tests. Levamisole suppresses the production of white blood cells, resulting in neutropenia and agranulocytosis. With the increasing use of levamisole as an adulterant, a number of these complications have been reported among cocaine users. Levamisole has also been linked to a risk of vasculitis, and two cases of vasculitic skin necrosis have been reported in users of cocaine adulterated with levamisole. Levamisole-tainted cocaine has caused three deaths and sickened over 100 in US and Canada, as of 2009. Chemistry The original synthesis at Janssen Pharmaceutica resulted in the preparation of a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, whose hydrochloride salt was reported to have a melting point of 264‚Äì265 ¬∞C; the free base of the racemate has a melting point of 87‚Äì89 ¬∞C. The racemic mixture is referred to as \\"tetramisole\\" - levamisole refers only to the levorotatory enantiomer of tetramisole. Toxicity The LD50 (intravenous, mouse) is 22 mg/kg.J. Symoens et al. (1979). In Pharmacological and Biochemical Properties of Drug Substances, Vol. 2, (M. E. Goldberg, Ed.), pp. 407-464, Washington: American Pharmaceutical Association.  Laboratory use  Levamisole reversibly and noncompetitively inhibits most isoforms of alkaline phosphatase (e.g., human liver, bone, kidney, and spleen) except the intestinal and placental isoform. It is thus used as an inhibitor along with substrate to reduce background alkaline phosphatase activity in biomedical assays involving detection signal amplification by intestinal alkaline phosphatase, for example in in situ hybridization or Western blot protocols. It is used to immobilize the nematode C. elegans on glass slides for imaging and dissection. Schedl Lab Protocol for gonad dissections In a C. elegans behavioral assay, analyzing the time course of paralysis provides information about the neuromuscular junction. Levamisole acts as an acetylcholine receptor agonist, which leads to muscle contraction. Continuing activation leads to paralysis. The time course of paralysis provides information about the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. For example, mutants with fewer acetylcholine receptors may paralyze slower than wild type. Research It has also been studied as a method to stimulate the immune system as part of the treatment of cancer. It has also shown some efficacy in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome in children.

Biography  = Career =  Shorts  Aftermath is the second in a trilogy of short films known as La Trilogia De La Muerte (The Trilogy of Death). The first film, Awakening, runs for only 8 minutes. Created in 1990, it tells of a boy for whom time stops upon falling asleep in a classroom, only later realising that he had actually died and was experiencing an out-of-body phenomenon. The 1994 sequel, Aftermath, runs at a significantly longer time of 32 minutes, which depicts defilement, mutilation, and necrophilia (see Necrophilia in popular culture for more). The 35 minute finale, Genesis (1998), shows the life of a sculptor whose artwork comes to life while he turns to stone, his work gradually consuming him. The trilogy represents the three stages of life, and in each instance, Cerd√† shows how vulnerable we are to the whims of elements beyond our control; time, others, and material possessions respectively.  Features  Cerd√† also directed The Abandoned which is about an American film producer who returns to her homeland, Russia, to discover the truth about her family history. The film was first released in the US as part of the After Dark Horrorfest in November 2006. The film received a stand-alone release in theaters in February 2007. The DVD was released on June 19, 2007. In 2011, Paris-based Full House announced that Cerd√† would be directing an adaptation of the comic book I Am Legion. The film will be written by Richard Stanley.  Personal life  Cerd√† collects film prints and has a collection of a hundred.

He appears in many of Newman's short stories as both a central and background character, primarily within the Diogenes Club series; however, an alternative version of the character appears in the Anno Dracula series as well. He is the focal point of a collection of short stories entitled The Man from the Diogenes Club.  Character  Jeperson - among the first characters created by Newman in his early efforts at fiction - is a homage to many of the 'telefantasy' heroes present on British television during the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Jason King (Department S / Jason King), John Steed (The Avengers) and the Third Doctor (Doctor Who). As such, he shares many character traits with them - a flamboyant dress sense, upper-class tastes and sensibilities combined with a youthful appreciation of the 'trendy' aspects of 1970s culture, a chivalrous and patriotic nature, and a healthy disdain for most representations of establishment authority. The stories in which he appears also parody / homage these telefantasy shows, and frequently examine 1970s British culture and society through this lens. In the story \\"Swellhead\\", set in the 2000s, a character compares him to Austin Powers. In these stories, the character acts as an investigator for the Diogenes Club (established in the Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle), a branch of Britain's intelligence and law-enforcement community existing outside of regular channels designed to investigate (and where necessary, put a stop to) psychic, paranormal and unusual phenomena. The character himself is unusually empathic to an explicitly paranormal level, possessing a keen sensitivity to both these phenomena and to the thoughts and feelings of others. Jeperson's background in the stories is the subject of much mystery and examination; a war orphan, he possesses no memories prior to 1945, where he was found by his adoptive father, Geoffrey Jeperson, in a Nazi death camp, possibly held as the subject of experiments into his psychic abilities. He was subsequently raised by his father within the Diogenes Club, replacing the occult investigation position held by Carnacki and eventually becoming the club's 'Most Valued Member'. Jeperson frequently shares his adventures with two other operatives - Vanessa, an amnesiac Emma Peel-like agent whom Richard once saved from a demon-like creature that was possessing her, and Fred Regent, a police officer seconded to the employ of the Diogenes Club following an adventure against psychically-induced demon Nazis.  Stories  The following stories - all written by Newman - feature Jeperson in a central role. All appear in the Man From the Diogenes Club collection. *\\"The End of the Pier Show\\": When members of a white power skinhead gang he is investigating undercover are brutally slaughtered by twisted apparitions of Nazi leaders on a disused seaside pier, D.C. Fred Regent meets Richard Jeperson and Vanessa as they uncover and confront the unexpected consequences of a conspiracy in a small coastal village that seems to have never left the 1940s. *\\"You Don't Have To Be Mad\\": A series of unusual deaths all possess one common link - the victims, all professionals, had recently undertaken a private executive health course. As Richard discovers the unsavoury government connections behind the scenes of the course, Vanessa goes undercover and finds herself battling to retain her own sense of identity against the course's unusual treatments. *\\"Tomorrow Town\\": Richard and Vanessa investigate the murder of the founder of 'Tomorrow Town', an experimental community populated by futurists attempting to determine a perfect projection of the year 2000, only to discover that the 'future' is not functioning as well as its inhabitants claim. *\\"Egyptian Avenue\\": A series of Egyptian-themed hauntings at a Victorian era cemetery uncover a grisly secret in a long-forgotten tomb and the sinister plans of an ailing publisher obsessed with Ancient Egypt. *\\"Soho Golem\\": Richard and Fred investigate the seedy world of the Soho red- light district when a mysterious golem begins murdering corrupt police officers and pornographers. *\\"The Serial Murders\\": When the events of a popular soap opera start reflecting and predicting real life to an unnatural degree, Richard finds himself combatting voodoo practitioners and falling in love with a beautiful academic researcher. *\\"The Man Who Got Off The Ghost Train\\": In the early days of Thatcher's Britain, a train ride to Northern Scotland after a mysterious summons from Vanessa prompts Richard to relate to Fred the story of his first mission for the Diogenes Club in the 1950s - the haunting of an express train by a ghoul with apocalyptic designs for humanity. *\\"Swellhead\\": In modern-day Britain, an aged Richard Jeperson is reluctantly brought out of retirement to investigate unusual goings-on at the island of Skerra, and finds himself trapped in the impossible lair of an evil genius as the walls separating numerous alternate realities begin to break down. As well as the stories featured in The Man from the Diogenes Club, Jeperson also appears in: *Seven Stars - \\"The Biafran Bank Manager\\": A chapter of Newman's novella-length homage to Bram Stoker's The Jewel of Seven Stars, in which Jeperson is called upon to defend his mentor, Edwin Winthrop, from the curse that has haunted him since the dark days of World War II, following his use of dark magic in the struggle against the Axis Powers. *\\"Who Dares Wins: Anno Dracula 1980\\": Set in the alternate history of Newman's Anno Dracula series, the short story revolves around a hostage siege of the Transylvanian embassy by a vampire separatist political movement (mirroring the Iranian Embassy Siege of 1980 in the 'real' history). Jeperson's appearance is a brief cameo. He serves as the Chairman of the Ruling Cabal of the Diogenes Club. *\\"The Man on the Clapham Omnibus\\": In an alternate history in which Britain has been transformed by a second civil war, a young man boards the wrong bus and sees something that puts him on the hitlist of a sinister conspiracy. To save his own life he must defeat the conspiracy's latest plot, with the assistance of an eclectic group that includes Richard Jeperson, the only remaining member of a Diogenes Club that has already faced the conspiracy and lost. *\\"Cold Snap\\": Written for Secret Files of the Diogenes Club, Jeperson leads a group against \\"the Cold\\", a being that also appears in Newman's Doctor Who novella \\"Time and Relative\\". *\\"Moon Moon Moon\\": Jeperson and FBI agent Whitney Gauge attempt to prevent a moon cult from destroying the Apollo 11 mission.

History January 1869: Forty-five Hotelmen met at Hotel Trier, in Koblenz, Germany and created an Alliance under the name of All Hotelmen Alliance (AHA) with the aim of facilitating growth and organization in the industry. In that era, hotels were of a different standard, and needed a strong voice to communicate their needs and sustain their businesses. Moving forward, in April 1921, various European, African and North and South American hotel associations met and decided to merge into a new globally recognized, international association, under the name of the International Hotels Alliance (IHA). November 1947: Shortly after the end of the Second World War and the creation of the United Nations, hoteliers from the IHA met together with The European Aubergistes Association, and with the Asian Innkeepers Association in London, United Kingdom, and decided to merge into a larger international association aimed at defending the hospitality private sector worldwide, by lobbying governments, public sectors, and the Military. This was the launch of the International Hotels Association (IHA). September 1949: The French Government registered IHA and granted it the status of a Public Utility Association and a Non-Profit status. Their head office was moved from London and established in the heart of Paris, France. December 1949: The Argentinean Government recognized IHA and gave it a Non-Profit status, under the name of Associasion Internacional de Hosteleria. May 1950: The West German Government recognized IHA and gave it a Non-Resident Association status, under the name of Internationaler Hotelverband. November 1953: The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) gave IHA the status of Consultative Representation of hoteliers worldwide. Further, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development granted IHA a Permanent Observer status. October 1960:The Hotel Association of New York (HANYC) applied to join IHA and become the first US association to join IHA and to become a full member. January 1978: New by-laws and articles of incorporations came into effect worldwide and for the first time, all global IHA members met and voted to adopt them effective immediately for a period of 30 years. November 1997: IHA merged with the International Organization of Hotels and Restaurants, creating a new entity that came to be known as the International Hotels and Restaurants Associations (IH&RA;). March 2005: The United Nations affirmed the recognition of IH&RA.; January 2008: IH&RA;‚Äôs head office was moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, to correspond with the adoption of new articles of corporations and by-laws. February 2008: The Swiss government registered IH&RA; with its new adopted status. May 2016: Dr. Ghassan Aidi was elected President of IH&RA; for a term of four years. In the present time, IH&RA; has expanded its offices to Geneva, Paris and Barcelona, with new international offices opening soon in Washington, D.C. and Hong Kong.

It was directed by Nicolas Roeg and broadcast December 8, 1996.  Plot  Samson is chosen by God to destroy the Philistines, who have occupied the land of Canaan. He is given the greatest strength ever known to man as long as he remains true to his vow and its conditions, yet he still is not convinced of his purpose, preferring instead to spend his time with Philistine company. He eventually falls in love with a Philistine girl, decides to marry her, but is betrayed by her on his wedding day. He soon learns she was blackmailed by the Philistine lords who are plotting his demise, and goes to reclaim her, but she has been murdered along with her entire family. Meanwhile, a treacherous courtesan of the king, Delilah, is convinced of her ability to bring even the mighty Samson to his knees. She appeals to Samson as a beautiful woman, and Samson is immediately taken with her. They begin the relationship of two passionate lovers, and Delilah convinces Samson of her love, ultimately seducing him into telling her the secret of his strength. Samson is thus at last captured by the Philistines, who blind him and make him into a slave, forcing him to grind grain at a millstone. At the celebration of his and his kingdom's defeat, he is brought in chains to be both an example and entertainment to his captors. Unbeknownst to them, his strength has returned, and as he stands between the two pillars that support the building, he asks God for forgiveness. He then pushes against the pillars, collapsing the building and killing those inside, including himself. Delilah, who was present in the temple, also dies as well. As often in film and movies Delilah is portrayed as weak and unwise but not evil and apparently genuinely in love with Samson.

Biographical details Born 22 November 1720, at Briey, Lorraine in France. At an early age he entered the Society of Jesus, but left it after his ordination to the priesthood. He was made parish priest of Omerville and later a canon of Noyon. He died about 1794 at Noyon. Histoire de l'√©glise His most important work is entitled \\"Histoire de l'√©glise\\" (in English: \\"History of the Church\\") and was issued at Paris, 1778‚Äì90, in twenty- four volumes. The history gives a circumstantial account of the Catholic Church from the time of its founding up to the year 1721. It is not so much intended for students and learned investigators as for educated Christians, and especially for those priests whose professional cares do not allow them time to carry on higher studies. On account of its general usefulness his work has had a large circulation; in spite of many defects, especially in the later volumes, it has often been republished, as at Maastricht (1780‚Äì91), at Toulouse (1811). It has also been translated into foreign languages; it was published in Italian at Venice (1793), and in German at Vienna (1784). Various scholars have continued the history or have issued it in a condensed form. Instances are the edition of Guillon (Besan√ßon, and Paris, 1820‚Äì21), that of Pelier de la Croix (Ghent, 1829‚Äì33), and that of Robiano (Lyon and Paris, 1835 and 1842). The best edition, with a continuation up to 1844, was edited by Henrion (Paris, 1844). The best condensed edition was edited by Gams (Innsbruck, 1854‚Äì60).

He was the eleventh Marine to be awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism in Korea. Poynter was a Marine veteran of World War II and father of six children. He reenlisted in the Marine Corps at the outbreak of the Korean War. Biography James Irsley Poynter was born on December 1, 1916, in Bloomington, Illinois. He enlisted in the regular Marine Corps in February 1942. He fought in the Pacific Theatre during World War II, participating in the Guadalcanal, Southern Solomons, Saipan, Tinian and Okinawa campaigns. Poynter was discharged in February 1946. At the beginning of the Korean War, he re-enlisted in the Marine Corps, joining the 13th Infantry Battalion, Marine Corps Reserve in Los Angeles on July 19, 1950.

POYNTER UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE for service as set forth in the following CITATION: :For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a Squad Leader in a Rifle Platoon of Company A, First Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces during the defense of Hill 532, south of Sudong, Korea, on 4 November 1950. When a vastly outnumbering, well-concealed hostile force launched a sudden, vicious counterattack against his platoon's hasty defensive position, Sergeant Poynter displayed superb skill and courage in leading his squad and directing its fire against the onrushing enemy. With his ranks critically depleted by casualties and he himself critically wounded as the onslaught gained momentum and the hostile force surrounded his position, he seized his bayonet and engaged in bitter hand-to-hand combat as the break-through continued. Observing three machine guns closing in at a distance of twelve-five yards, he dashed from his position and, grasping hand grenades from fallen Marines as he ran, charged the emplacements in rapid succession, killing the crews of two and putting the other out of action before he fell, mortally wounded. By his self-sacrificing and valiant conduct, Sergeant Poynter inspired the remaining members of his squad to heroic endeavor in bearing down upon and repelling the disorganized enemy, thereby enabling the platoon to move out of the trap to a more favorable tactical position. His indomitable fighting spirit, fortitude and great personal valor maintained in the face of overwhelming odds sustain and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country. /S/ HARRY S.

She was the daughter of Sultan Mahmud II and sister of the Sultans Abdulmejid I and Abdulaziz. Early life Adile Sultan was born on 23 May 1826. Her father was Sultan Mahmud II, and her mother was Zernigar Hanƒ±m. After her mother's death in 1830, when she was four years old, she was entrusted to the care of her father's senior consort, Nevfidan Kadƒ±n. Adile's was educated at the palace. She took lessons of Quran, Arabic, Persian, music and calligraphy. She took her calligraphy lessons with Ebubekir M√ºmtaz Efendi, the most famous calligrapher of the era. With the education she received, combined with her sensitive personality, she went on to write poems, becoming the only princess to do so. After her father's death in 1839, when she was thirteen years old, her elder half-brother, the new sultan Abdulmejid I, took her under his guardianship. Marriage In 1845, her brother Sultan Abdulmejid arranged her marriage to Mehmet Ali Pasha, who had been serving as an advisor in the imperial arsenal. Born in Hem≈üin, he was the son of Hacƒ± √ñmer Agha, the chief agha of Galata. He came to Istanbul at a very young age, where he spent his childhood in the Enderun. The palace of Hatice Sultan was allocated to her on her marriage she spend the winter in Ne≈üatabad Palace. The preparations for the marriage began on 24 March 1845, and the marriage contract was concluded on 28 April in the apartment of the sacred relics, Topkapƒ± Palace. After the ceremony was performed, the trousseau was brought to the Dar√ºssaade Aƒüa from where it was taken through the Tophane Street to √áƒ±raƒüan Palace. The wedding celebrations were delayed until next summer. The wedding took place in February 1846, and lasted a whole week. On the last day of the celebrations, Adile was taken to Ne≈üatabad Palace, which was allocated to her in Fƒ±ndƒ±klƒ±. After the marriage, Mehmet Ali Pasha became commander of the fleet, and served on this position for five times, and afterwards served a short while as Grand Vizier to her brother, Sultan Abdulmejid. He died in 1868 during the reign of her younger half-brother, Sultan Abd√ºlaziz. The two together had three children, one son Sultanzade Ismail Bey, and three daughters, Hayriye Hanƒ±msultan, Sƒ±dƒ±ka Hanƒ±msultan, and Aliye Hanƒ±msultan. Their only surviving daughter, Hayriye was born in 1849. She was successively the wife of two pashas. She built a convent (tekke) near the mausoleum of her father. She died in 1869, a year after her father. In deep mourning, Adile Sultan entered the order of Naqshbandi and devoted herself to charitable activities. Character Adile Sultan was a poetess and a scholarly, cultivated, and pious woman renowned for her benevolence, good works, and charity. She penned beautiful elegies to her husband when he died. Those in her service and in close relations with her always spoke with pleasure of her and her polite manners. She was also in the habit of smoking the water pipe. She always dressed in a completely Turkish fashion gown of heavy fabrics with four flounces, shoes of chamois leather, shawl tied as a sash around her waist, the so-called salta wide-sleeved jacket over this ensemble, on her head something like a fez wrapped in a silk headkerchief pinked along the edges, and onto which she had fastened exquisite brooches of emeralds and rubies in the shape of roses, a larger one in the center flanked by two smaller ones. Other than these she wore no jewels or decorations. Charities Adile Sultan had a summerhouse in Validebaƒü and a palace in Kandilli, the Adile Sultan Palace, both in the Asian part of Istanbul. She left her palace in Kandilli following the death of her husband and moved to the Coastal Palace in Fƒ±ndƒ±klƒ±. She donated the Adile Sultan Palace to the state on the condition that it be converted into the first secondary high school for girls in the Ottoman Empire. Her wish was fulfilled only in 1916 (due to wars), when the Young Turk activist, statesman, and educator Ahmed Rƒ±za opened the Adile Sultan ƒ∞nas Mekteb-i Sultanisi (\\"Adile Sultan Imperial Girls School\\"), today known as Kandilli Anatolian High School for Girls, although it became not the first, but the second secondary school for girls in the empire. The high school moved to a new building in 1969, and the Adile Sultan Palace burned down in 1986 due to an electrical short-circuit. It was reopened in 2006 as the Sakƒ±p Sabancƒ± Kandilli Education and Culture Center. Poetry Even though she was not much more successful than Leyla Hanƒ±m and Fƒ±tnat Hanƒ±m, two renowned female poets of her era, Adile Sultan's literary works shed light on the incidents in the palace and the administration of the Ottoman Empire. Adile Sultan also composed a poem about the alleged murder of her younger brother Sultan Abd√ºlaziz (1830‚Äì1876), which was officially known as a suicide. She also assisted with printing the Diwan of Suleiman the Magnificent (1494‚Äì1566). Her poetry, Adile Sultan's Divan, was published in 1996. Death Adile Sultan died on 12 February 1899 at the age of seventy- three, the last surviving child of Mahmud. She was interred in the mausoleum of her husband in Ey√ºp, Istanbul.
