Born Charles Edward Card Jr. (January 18, 1905 ‚Äì October 26, 1974), he was known throughout the racing and hot rod communities by the trade name Honest Charley. In 1948 he created the Honest Charley's Speed Shop in Chattanooga, Tennessee in the United States. The company became well known for its unique and entertaining catalogs which were originally hand drawn. Honest Charley's also attracted the attention of the aftermarket parts industry for its innovative distribution techniques.Bill Schrenk, Managing Editor, Automotive Chain Store, January 1966 He was a racing enthusiast, patron and sponsor. He was a USAC Life Time Member with member number 121 and early member of the Indy 500 Old Timers Club.Current Honest Charley website Honest Charley Speed Shop In 1970 he became the second inductee into Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) Hall of Fame. Early years Honest Charley's father was of Scottish descent and lived in New Jersey.Ralph Guldahl Jr., Hot Rod, March 1971 During the reconstruction era following the American Civil War, Charles Card Sr. moved south and started a wholesale produce company which prospered for 48 yearsCharles Pennington, The Chattanooga Times, August 19, 1963 as Chattanooga increasingly grew as an industrial and manufacturing center especially during World War I. While working 17 years in his father's business, he developed a strong work ethic and a good sense for business, but it was maintaining the truck fleet that first interested him in customizing automobiles. His nickname In 1940 he opened a restaurant on Chestnut Street in downtown Chattanooga just opposite the Read House. In an effort to increase profit he removed the cash register to make room for one more paying customer at the counter. When patrons would come out, he would ask them what they owed and collect from them as they had reported. People frequently commented \\"You sure are honest, Charley.\\" He adopted the nickname and put it on his sign.Jim Donnelly, Hemmings Muscle Machines, September 2004 Embracing a local colloquialism he also added the suffix \\"Hisself\\" and was often referred to as Honest Hisself. SEMA News, January 2012 Founding the Speed Shop During the '40s he spent many weekends driving to stock car races with his wife, Grace, and two daughters, Martha and Ann and a trunkful of racing parts for sale or trade. After several years of networking and getting to know the drivers and the market, he decided to take the next step, and in 1948 he started Honest Charley's Speed Shop along with his son-in-law Robert J. Espy as a partner. They began with a modest retail front of just 260 square feet at 2204 McCallie Ave. The catalog From the beginning Honest Charley's was best known for its entertaining and unique catalog. The early issues were actually hand drawn by Honest and his daughters. He created a caricature of \\"Hisself\\" for a logo and always drew little cartoons in the margins. Motortopia, May 25, 2010 Aside from the entertainment value, the catalogs established Honest Charley's as the first coast-to-coast mail order distributor of high-performance aftermarket parts. Leader of a growth industry Honest Charley's keen sense of business put him in the forefront of an industry which was poised for growth. After World War II, many returning soldiers had a great deal of mechanical aptitude after keeping GI vehicles running on the battlefield, and they had a need for excitement. Hot rods were made popular by magazines and movies. Hot Rod (1950), The Fast And The Furious (1954) and Running Wild (1955) and other movies were in theaters. American Hot Rod Foundation website Pete Petersen began publishing Hot Rod Magazine with encouragement and capital investment from Honest Charley, who was also an advertiser in the first issue. As business grew, Honest Charley's Speed Shop moved to a larger 14,000 square foot store at 3813 Rossville Blvd. In 1964 Honest designed and built a state-of-art 30,000 square foot distribution warehouse at 108 Honest Street off Lee Hwy. near the runway of Lovell Field. While attending major races such as the Indianapolis 500, Honest established personal relationships with many of the West Coast manufacturers like Vic Edelbrock, Fred Offenhauser, Phil Weiand, Ed Iskenderian (Isky Cams), Els Lohn (Eelco), Willie Garner (Trans Dapt), Paul Schiefer, and George Hurst. Through this network he was able to influence output supply and avoid backorder problems which negatively effected other distributors. Also he was also able to have some products labeled as his own brand. In addition to retail, Honest Charley's sold wholesale to many small chains and independent stores. In the 1970s the company began franchising smaller stores across the southeast. Racing sponsorship Honest Charley built several race cars during the early years of the Speed Shop. Each was recognizable by his company name hand painted on the side of the car. In 1953 on the Daytona Beach Road Course his modified '39 Ford sedan with a Mercury 59A engine won the Daytona Century Race with a speed of 137 mph. He was a major sponsor of drag racers \\"TV Tommy\\" Ivo and \\"Jungle Jim\\" Liberman, both of whom prominently displayed his logo on their cars. From 1971-72 he sponsored the NHRA sanctioned All-American Stars & Stripes Whole Earth Open Drags race at Beech Bend Park in Bowling Green, KY. He attended the Indy 500 every year from the '30s to the '70s. He was well known at many other tracks such as Daytona and Bristol. The Speed Shop after Honest Charley Honest Charley died in 1974. His son-in-law and partner Robert J. Espy continued to operate the company until it succumbed in 1990 to an ever-increasing competition of larger retailers entering the market and restrictive environmental regulations regarding aftermarket alteration of automobiles. In 1998 Coker Tire of Chattanooga acquired the brand rights and revitalized the name Honest Charley's Speed Shop as an internet retailer. They also have a retail front and garage on Chestnut Street just a few blocks from where Honest Charley's restaurant once stood. In the garage they build and restore custom hot rods and motorcycles and have been featured on cable TV shows such as American Pickers and Car Wars.

Early career Albert Borgard was born in Holb√¶k, Jutland, on 10 November 1659 of unknown parents. He is generally referred to as Albert Borgard in English and Albrecht Borgaard or Borregaard in Danish. He joined the Danish army in 1675, during the war between Sweden and Denmark, and was made a gunner in 1676. He served throughout the war, and at its close, in 1679, held the rank of fireworker, and was ordered to make a survey of the island of Zealand. \\"In 1680,\\" he wrote, \\"I, with another fireworker, was ordered to Berlin, in exchange of two Brandenburgher fireworkers, sent to Denmark to learn the difference of each nation's works, relating to all sorts of warlike and pleasant fireworks\\". He served at the relief of Vienna, at the battle of Gran, Hungary (1685), and the siege of Buda. In 1688 he left the Danish service, on account of \\"some injustice done him in his promotion\\", and went to Poland as a volunteer; but he was offered a commission in the Prussian Guards, which he accepted. In the Prussian army he served upon the Rhine, and at the siege of Bonn. In 1692 he left the Prussian army, with a commission to raise a regiment for the emperor; but failing in this design, he went in April to the camp of Louis XIV before Namur. He distinguished himself in the attack on the fortress; and the French king ordered him 1,000 crowns, and offered him a captain's commission. But Borgard, a sturdy Protestant, refused the tempting offer, and joined Colonel Gore, whose acquaintance he had made at Bonn, as a volunteer. Family Borgard first married in 1703 Barbara Bradshaw (d. 1714); they had several children including George (baptised 1704) and Albert (baptised 30 May 1706 at St Dunstan, Stepney). His second wife was Catherine [Cathrine/Catharine)], daughter of Georg Mikkelsen (d. 1665), merchant and head of the Danish church in London. Their children included Thomas Michael (bap. 1717), Catharine (bap. 17 September 1717), Mary (bap. 1724), Katharine Ambrosia (bap. 30 December 1727), Frederick (bap. 1728) and Elizabeth (bap. 1730). Mary Borgard married James Pattison, Royal Artillery officer. They had one son, Nathaniel, who died as an infant. Albert Borgard died at Woolwich, where he was living, on 7 February 1751 and was buried in the Danish church in Marine [Wellclose] Square, near the Tower of London. British service Though but thirty-three years of age when he joined the English army, he had been present at eleven battles and twelve sieges, and was one of the most experienced artillery and engineer officers in the world. Gore introduced him to William III, who saw his ability, and made him a firemaster in the English service in 1693, and captain and adjutant of the artillery in Flanders in 1695. He was present at the battles of Steenkirk and Landen and the sieges of Huy and Namur. When at the peace of 1697 all the foreign artillerymen in English pay were dismissed, he, with only one other officer named Schlunt, was taken to England, and in 1698 made an engineer by William III's special command. In 1702 he helped to take Forts Ste.-Catherine, Matagorda, and Durand. On his return to England he married Barbara Bradshaw, by whom he had several children. After serving in Flanders he was gazetted lieutenant-colonel of artillery, and sent to command the artillery in Spain and Portugal in the army of Lord Galway. He took Valencia de Alc√°ntara, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Alc√°ntara, and made Galway's advance into Spain justifiable from a purely military point of view. In 1708 he superintended the reduction of the castle of San Felipe in Minorca. He was present with Stanhope at the battles of Almanza, Almanara, Saragossa, where he was wounded in four places, and at Villa Viciosa, where he was wounded, left for dead, and taken prisoner. On being exchanged he returned to England, and was appointed chief firemaster on 9 August 1712. In 1713 he made use of some of his old Berlin lessons in \\"pleasant fireworks\\", and, to quote his own words, \\"made pleasure fireworks which were burnt on the River Thames in the month of August over against Whitehall on the Thanksgiving-day for the peace made at Utrecht\\". In 1715 he commanded the train of artillery sent to the Duke of Argyll in Scotland, in 1718 he was made assistant-surveyor of ordnance, and in 1719 commanded the artillery in the expedition to Vigo. This was Colonel Borgard's last piece of active service; but his greatest service of all was the formation of the Regiment of Royal Artillery. Royal Artillery In his own account of his services Borgard says: \\"In 1722 his late Majesty was graciously pleased to renew my old commission as colonel, and to give me the command of the regiment of artillery, established for his service, consisting of four companies.\\" His honourable behaviour as colonel-commandant is noted in a letter of his nephew, Major-General Albert Borgard Michelsen: \\"He was strictly honest, and declared often, and shortly before he died, that he could safely affirm it upon oath that he had never made 6 pence out of his regiment above what the king allowed, and gave up the cloathing of the regiment to the Board of Ordnance, that he might not be suspected to have any profit of it... He was in great favour with Prince George of Denmark, and with King George the 1st and 2nd\\" (Olsen). Borgard was promoted major-general in 1735, and lieutenant-general in 1739. When he died at Woolwich, on 7 February 1751, at the great age of ninety-two, he left to his successor, General Belford, one of the finest corps of artillery in the world.

The game is based on the comic book series Asterix, and is part of a series of games based on this franchise. Gameplay Asterix is a typical side scrolling platform game where either Asterix or Obelix must navigate through each stage, in most stages the player must locate a key that will open a door at the end of the stage, some stages a boss must be defeated to complete the stage. The game is broken up into 8 different areas with between 1 and 3 stages in each area. The player starts with 3 lives and 3 health points, a health point is lost if the character is hit by an enemy a live is lost if all health points are lost or the character falls down a hole. Health points can be obtained by picking up certain items during the game. When certain bosses are defeated a heart is obtained, collecting this heart increases the health capacity by one point. The character can have up to 6 health points. The player has the choice prior to each stage of choosing Asterix or Obelix to complete the stage, in level 1-1 the player must choose Asterix and level 1-2 the player must choose Obelix. The game can be played with 1 or 2 players, in 2 player mode each player takes turns at completing the stage, player 1 plays the game as Asterix and player 2 plays as Obelix. The stages in the game differ depending on whether the player is playing the stage as Asterix or Obelix. Asterix has the ability to destroy blocks using a magic potion that can be picked up during the level, the block is destroyed by throwing the potion at the block and waiting for the potion to explode. Obelix is able to destroy blocks with a punch and the potion used by Asterix is not available to Obelix. Both characters can defeat enemies with a punch. Obelix being larger in size is unable to access some parts of the level that Asterix would be able to access, Asterix is unable to access some parts of the level due if the potion is unavailable and Asterix is unable to break the blocks surrounding the area. Due to the differences in the characters the maps for most levels are different for both Asterix and Obelix making some levels more easy or difficult for each character, some levels are the same for both characters. A bonus stage can be reached by collecting 50 bones. The bonus stage is played by Dogmatix, in the bonus stage Dogmatix must jump from bubble to bubble popping each bubble along the way.

It stars Kristoffer Tabori, Bob Balaban, Lawrence Pressman, Joyce Van Patten, Marlyn Mason, and a number of character actors familiar to TV audiences of the 1970s. Adapted from Leigh's novel What Can You Do?, the movie follows several months in the life of an intelligent, precocious 17-year-old high school student who fancies himself a smooth Lothario. Plot summary Phil Fuller (Tabori) is a 17-year-old high school student who lives in a small apartment with his young single mother. He assumes a facade of cynicism and tells his English teacher (Pressman) that he considers himself \\"smarter that 99% of the people\\". Seduction is his hobby. He beds the neglected wife of the high school basketball coach (Mason) by feigning being a sexually pent up virgin. Phil seduces a virginal classmate (Sherry Miles) by inviting her for a swim. Instead of a swim though, he pretends to make dinner for the two of them and spikes her food with pot. He even picks up a college girl by slapping on a fake mustache and hanging around the college bookstore. Phil seems to sail through life not taking his actions seriously until the repercussions of his actions begin to hit home. First, the classmate he deflowered tells him that she might be pregnant. While the girl wants to get married, Phil convinces her mother ( Louise Latham ), who also tried to seduce him, that her daughter should get an abortion instead. Next, he finds out that the gym teacher's wife, who has a phobia about growing old, told her husband about the affair after Phil dumps her. Then the coach defends his wife's honor by strong-arming Phil into a deserted weight room and kneeing him in the crotch. After arranging an illegal abortion for his pregnant girlfriend, he finds out that she is not pregnant but his mother is. Since her fianc√© has been killed in an auto accident, she decides to get an abortion. Phil uses the money he had gotten for his girlfriend and brings his mother to the doctor instead. The doctor assumes that Phil is responsible for the pregnancy. Full of scorn and wanting to teach Phil a lesson, he forces Phil to assist in the abortion. On the drive home afterward, Phil's mother sees that this episode has rendered him less cocky and more mature and responsible. Music The film score was composed by Charles Fox who composed hits such as \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\" and \\"I've Got a Name\\" as well as the theme songs for Love, American Style; Happy Days; and Laverne and Shirley. The movie featured two songs, \\"Morning Song\\" and \\"The All American\\" with music by Fox and lyrics by his frequent collaborator, Norman Gimbel.

Auralization is a procedure designed to model and simulate the experience of acoustic phenomena rendered as a soundfield in a virtualized space. This is useful in configuring the soundscape of architectural structures, concert venues, and public spaces, as well as in making coherent sound environments within virtual immersion systems.  History  The English term auralization was used for the first time by Kleiner et al. in an article in the journal of the AES en 1991.http://www.mattmontag.com/auralization/media/Auralization%20-%20An%20Overview.pdf The increase of computational power allowed the development of the first acoustic simulation software towards the end of the 1960s.M. Vorl√§nder. Auralization : Fundamentals of Acoustics, Modelling, Simulation, Algorithms and Acoustic Virtual Reality  Principles  Auralizations are experienced through systems rendering virtual acoustic models made by convolving or mixing acoustic events recorded 'dry' (or in an anechoic chamber) projected within a virtual model of an acoustic space, the characteristics of which are determined by means of sampling its impulse response (IR). Once this h(t) has been determined, the simulation of the resulting soundfield s(t) in the target environment is obtained by convolution: r(t) = h(t) * s(t) The resulting sound r(t) is heard as it would if emitted in that acoustic space.  Binaurality  For auralizations to be perceived as realistic, it is critical to emulate the human hearing in terms of position and orientation of the listener's head with respect to the sources of sound. For IR data to be convolved convincingly, the acoustic events are captured using a dummy head where two microphones are positioned on each side of the head to record an emulation of sound arriving at the locations of human ears, or using an ambisonics microphone array and mixed down for binaurality. Head-related transfer functions (HRTF) datasets can be used to simplify the process insofar as a monaural IR can be measured or simulated, then audio content is convolved with its target acoustic space. In rendering the experience, the transfer function corresponding to the orientation of the head is applied to simulate the corresponding spatial emanation of sound.

Foelke Kampana (1355 ‚Äì c. 1418), also known as Foelke the Cruel, was a Frisian noble. She served as regent for the Frisian territories Oldeborg, Brokmerland, Auricherland and Emsigerland in East Frisia in 1400 during the absence of her son Keno II and in 1417 during the minority of her grandson Ocko II. Born in Hinte, Foelke was the daughter of Frisian Kempo von Hinte, chief of Westerburg van Hinte, and married in 1377 to Frisian knight Ocko I tom Brok (d. 1389), lord of Oldeborg, and chief of Brockmerland, Auricherland and Emsigerland in East Frisia. In 1389, her spouse fell in battle fighting on the side of the count of Holland. Foelke had tried to assist them, and raised her own army to aid him, but when she arrived, he was already dead. During her absence, Aurich was captured by an enemy, who barricaded himself in the church. Foelke retook Aurich with her army and executed two hundred prisoners. Because her son Keno was still a minor, Widzel tom Brok, an older illegitimate son of her late spouse, succeeded his father as chieftain. During his ten-year rule, he aligned himself with Folkmar Allena, a traditional enemy of his father. Widmer died in a feud in April 1399. Her son, Keno II, was by then of legal majority. Foelke acted as his political adviser, until Keno's death in 1417. She then briefly became regent until her grandson Ocko came of age that same year. Foelke died soon after in Aurich and was buried there.Martha Kist, Kampana, Foelke in Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland. The court historian Eggerik Beninga (1490‚Äì1562), who was related to the Allena family, who competed for power with the Tom Brok family, introduced a number of legends about her in his Chronica der Fresen which led to her becoming an icon of cruelty. Some of the stories appear to be based on real atrocities committed by Keno II, which were transferred to his strong-willed mother.

After serving as president of Osaka Sh≈çsen Shipping Company (OSK Lines), he entered politics and later served as a cabinet minister. Biography Nakahashi was the son of a samurai in the service of the Maeda clan of Kaga Domain. After the Meiji Restoration, he studied at the law school of Tokyo Imperial University, specializing in his post-graduate curriculum in commercial law, and in 1886, soon after graduation, worked in Yokohama as a trial lawyer and judge in commercial cases. However, in 1887, he was scouted as a councilor for the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and then asked to serve as a legal councilor for the lower house of the Diet of Japan in 1889. In this capacity, he travelled to the United States and to Korea, serving subsequently in the secretariat of the House of Representatives, councilor to the Ministry of Communications, Director of the Audit Board of the Ministry of Communications, and Director of the Railway Bureau. In 1898, Nakahashi was asked by his father-in-law, Takana Ichibe, to assume the post of president of Osaka Sh≈çsen Shipping Company. He was active in expanding the firms operations in Taiwan, which had just become part of the Japanese Empire following the First Sino-Japanese War. He also served on the board of directors of Chisso, one of the minor zaibatsu, and it was during his tenure that Chisso began construction of a plant in Minamata, Kumamoto. Nakahashi‚Äôs political career began in 1901, when he was elected to the Osaka City Assembly, and served as its chairman. In the 1902 General Election, Nakahashi was elected to the House of Representatives of Japan from the Osaka general constituency and was re- elected five consecutive times. He joined the Rikken Seiy≈´kai in 1914. In 1918, he changed his constituency to the Kanazawa Prefectural general constituency. Nakahashi was appointed to the cabinet of the Hara Takashi administration as Education Minister in 1918. While Education Minister, Nakahashi sought to expand the higher education system in Japan, including the creation of five more medical schools, 29 schools of pharmacy, and creating additional imperial universities. Following Hara‚Äôs assassination in 1921, Nakahashi continued as Education Minister in the cabinet of Takahashi Korekiyo. In 1924, together with Tokonami Takejir≈ç, he joined the new Seiyu Hont≈ç, helping bring down the Takahashi administration, but returned to the Rikken Seiyukai in 1925. In 1927, under the cabinet of Tanaka Giichi, Nakahashi served as Minister of Commerce and Industry. On 23 May 1927, he established a Commerce and Industry Deliberation Council to examine issues with the Japanese economy, and to determine steps to take to improve the situation, compile economic statistics and to encourage economic rationalization through the mergers of companies.Johnson, page 101‚Äì103 In 1931, Nakahashi returned to the cabinet once more, as Home Minister under the Inukai Tsuyoshi administration, however, he was forced to resign his position in 1932 due to illness. He died in 1934 at the age of 74. His grave is at the temple of Gokoku-ji in Tokyo. References *Frederick, Louse. Japan Encyclopedia. Belknap Press (2002). * Hunter, Janet.

Born as Khor-re, he is better known as Lhachen Yeshe-√ñ, his spiritual name. Yeshe-√ñ was the second king in the succession of the kingdom of Guge in the southwestern Tibetan Plateau. Yeshe-√ñ abdicated the throne in 975 to become a lama. In classical Tibetan historiography, the restoration of an organized and monastic tradition of Tibetan Buddhism is attributed to him. He built Tholing Monastery in 997 when Tholing was the capital of Guge. Yeshe-√ñ' sponsored noviciates, including the great translator Rinchen Zangpo. Early life and rule From a young age, Yeshe-√ñ was interested in religious matters. He was the son of king Tashi-gon (bKra-shis-mgon), and ruled the merged the kingdoms of Tashigon and Detsugon, covering the regions of Purang and Guge and Zanskar, Spiti and Lahaul and Upper Kinnaur. He ruled over the combined Purnag-Guge Kingdom from 967. Yeshe-√ñ', better known by his spiritual name, Lhachen Yeshe-√ñ, was the first notable lama-king in Tibet. His first act as king was to issue commands decreed under the title bka‚Äô shog chen mo ('Great Dictums'), which reflected his primary aim of ruling his kingdom theocratically: it was the reason that he came to be known as 'a king and monk'. This orientation was to ensure propagation of Buddhism throughout Tibet. He commanded farmers and nomads to pay an endowment fee towards the maintenance of the monastery. The 'second diffusion of Buddhism' in Tibet is solely attributed to Yeshe-√ñ. He believed in reforming his kingdom under the ethos of three \\"R\\"s namely, religious education, religious architecture, and religious reform, during a time when the Indian Buddhist religious, artistic, architectural, scriptural and philosophical traditions permeated all the Tibetan world through Guge. Based on the practices followed in India, Yeshe-√ñ deputed twenty-one specially chosen young novitiates to be trained as monks in Kashmir and other parts of India. They were to study under Indian Buddhist Gurus in renowned institutions, and to translate Buddhist scriptures from the Sanskrit to Tibetan. Of the novitiates, only two survived, Rinchen Zangpo and Lekpai Sherap. The others succumbed to the extreme weather conditions of northern India. Rinchen Zangpo was such an impressive student that Yeshe-√ñ made him responsible for the translation of other Sanskrit scriptures, as well as the building of monasteries in Tibet. The first one in western Tibet, Tholing, was built in 997, after Yeshe-√ñ had been king for thirty years. The other main monasteries built under the king's initiative were Tabo Monastery in Ladakh, and the Khochar monastery. He ruled, along with his brother, the entire Western Himalayan region. He founded temples and encouraged the nobility of Tibet. He opposed the esoteric forms of tantric practices (mostly by non- organised groups) which were prevalent in Tibet, and felt revulsion about the introduction of Tantrism into Tibet's new culture of Buddhism. His wish was to maintain a purer and more rationalistic form of religion in Tibet, and his views were quoted in the Blue Annals, written in the fifteenth century. The large number of bronze works of art made of are credited to Nagaraja, one of his two sons.

He has been referred to as \\"one of the most provocative and far-reaching\\" among Japan's contemporary philosophers.Thomas P. Kasulis, Ohio State University, book cover of The Body, Self-Cultivation, and Ki-Energy Early life and education Yasuo Yuasa studied ethics under Watsuji Tetsuro at Tokyo University. He later also studied yoga with Motoyama Hiroshi, and these studies influenced his philosophical views.Erin McCarthy: Yuasa Yasuo (1925-2001): A retrospective of his life and work (first page view) Career In his early years Yuasa took up a position as assistant in the Ethics Department at the University of Tokyo. His places of employment include Yamanashi University, Osaka University, the University of Tsukuba and Obirin University. Work Much of his work, particularly since the end of the 1970s, has focused on theories of the body in Asian and Western philosophy, in religion and in medicine. He had particular interest in the mind-body problem, also developing his own model of mind-body function. The basis of Yuasa's work lies in both Eastern and Western traditions. He studied the works of Kitaro Nishida, of his teacher Tetsuro Watsuji, of Kiyoshi Miki and of Hajime Tanabe;Boutry-Stadelmann, B.: Yuasa Yasuo's Theory of the Body he also took into consideration Eastern meditation practices such as zen meditation and yoga, the Eastern notion of the meridians of the body, as well as Western depth psychology, in particular the Jungian approach.Chikako Ozawa‚ÄìDe Silva: Beyond the body/mind? Japanese contemporary thinkers on alternative sociologies of the body, Body & Society, 2002 Sage Publications, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 21‚Äì38 (full text) Yuasa looks at Descartes' dualism, and the contrasting philosophies of idealism with focus on the mind (spirit) and materialism with focus on the body (matter), and re-evaluates them in the light of Eastern non-dualistic thinking. True to Eastern tradition, he emphasizes that there exists no clear distinction between body and mind. While this is mainly an Eastern point of view, Yuasa acknowledged that similar thoughts have been expressed also by some Western thinkers, for example Merleau-Ponty. Yasuo goes further than existing philosophical tradition in postulating that the unity of body and mind is not a natural state or innate relationship, but rather a state to be achieved.Ornello Corazza: Rethinking embodiment: A Japanese contemporary perspective. A workshop in commemoration of Professor Yasuo Yuasa (1925‚Äì2005), Center for the Study of Japanese Religions, CSJR Newsletter, January 2007, No. 14/15 (with an account by Shigenori Nagatomo of Yuasa's Theory of the Body He points out the crucial role of self-cultivation for achieving such 'oneness of body‚Äìmind'. Expressed in simplified terms, Yuasa's scheme of the body consists in four systems: sensory-motor awareness (somesthesis, much like the sensory-motor apparatus of Bergson or the sensory-motor circuit of Merleau-PontyThomas P. Kasulis, Roger T. Aimes: Self As Body in Asian Theory and Practice, chapter \\"Yasua's Bodily Scheme\\", pp. 334 ff., State University of New York Press, 1993, ), kinaesthetic awareness (kinesthesis), emotion-instinct (governing the autonomic nervous system) and an unconscious 'quasi-body' (exemplified in the ki-energy flow through the body's meridians). Yasuo distinguishes bright consciousness and dark consciousness, comparing the latter to the Western idea of the unconscious. It has been pointed out that his concept of dark consciousness is more similar to the notion of subconsciousness of Frederic W. H. Myers and William James than to Sigmund Freud's concept of the unconscious.G.

It operates in two geographically distinct areas, one serving parts of Norfolk and Suffolk, and the other serving parts of Essex and Greater London. The total population served is 1.8 million. Essex and Suffolk is a 'water only' supplier, with sewerage services provided by Anglian Water and Thames Water within its areas of supply. It is part of the Northumbrian Water Group. History The South Essex Waterworks Company and the Southend Waterworks Company merged to form the Essex Water Company in 1970. In 1994 the Essex Water Company merged with Suffolk Water Company to form Essex and Suffolk Water. Since 2000 it has been part of Northumbrian Water, but continues to trade under the Essex and Suffolk Water name in the area. =Southend Waterworks Company= The Southend Waterworks Company had its origins in Southend-on-Sea in 1865 when a private undertaking constructed a well in Milton Road. A pumping station pumped the water to a reservoir on Cambridge Road. In 1871, the Southend Waterworks Company Limited was formed, and bought the works. The company became a statutory undertaker in 1879,Southend Waterworks Act 1879 (42 & 43 Vict. c.cxx) which restricted the amount of money they could borrow, the profits they could retain and the dividend payable to shareholders, but gave them powers to lay pipes beneath public streets and on private land. By 1924, the company were supplying an area of bounded on the south by the River Thames, on the north by the River Crouch, and stretching westwards to the outskirts of Shenfield. As the volume of water required increased, additional wells were sunk, until there were 36 wells or boreholes in operation. They penetrated a layer of London clay near the surface, and continued into the sands of the Lower London tertiary deposits below that, but the yields obtained were generally poor and gradually diminished over time. In 1921 the company started to look at extracting water from rivers, but failed to obtain parliamentary approval for a joint scheme with the South Essex Waterworks Company to obtain water from the River Stour on the border between Essex and Suffolk. They therefore developed a scheme to extract water from the River Blackwater, the River Chelmer and its tributary, the River Ter. An Act of Parliament was obtained in August 1924,Southend Waterworks Act 1924 (14 & 15 Geo. 5 c.lxii) to enable construction of Langford Works, to the west of Maldon. The project involved the construction of intakes on the Chelmer and Ter, so that water from either or both could be fed into a concrete pipeline which was in diameter and long. The water flowed by gravity along the pipeline to two sedimentation reservoirs each covering and capable of holding . Water from the Blackwater intake at Langford Mill is pumped to the sedimentation reservoirs. From there the water flows by gravity to the Langford pumping station. In order to maintain the quality of the water, effluent discharged from the Chelmsford sewage treatment works on the Chelmer and the Witham sewage treatment works on the Blackwater was piped to new outfalls below the intakes. When built, the Langford pumping station contained two triple- expansion steam engines, with room for a third, which was fitted in 1931. There were used in pairs, and each drove a low lift pump to transfer water to the treatment works, and a high lift pump to take treated water and pump it along a cast iron pipe to Southend. The pipe crossed below the River Crouch at Hullbridge, where shafts were built on either side of the river, and a tunnel was constructed between them. The water main is formed of twin steel tubes within the tunnel. The engines were normally worked in pairs, and a pair could deliver per day. In August 1927, water from the Chelmer started to be used, and between then and 1945, 96 per cent of the water supplied by Southend Waterworks came from Langford. The wells and boreholes were maintained, to provide a backup supply when necessary. In 1960, work began on replacing the steam engines at Langford pumping station with semi-automatic electric pumps. The project cost ¬£260,000, and was formally inaugurated on 31 October 1963, when Sir George Chaplin, the Chairman of Essex County Council switched on the new pumps. In the late 1960s, construction of a new treatment works next to the storage reservoirs began. The works cost ¬£1.5 million, and were opened on 30 June 1970. They can produce of treated water per day. Earlier that year, the Essex Water OrderEssex Water Order 1970 S.I. 1970/786: Regrouping Order: transfer of the water undertakings of certain local authorities and the Southend Waterworks Company to the South Essex Waterworks Company was passed by Parliament, and on 1 April Southend Waterworks Company amalgamated with South Essex Waterworks Company to become the Essex Water Company. Negotiations between Maldon District Council, Essex and Suffolk Water and other interested parties in 1996 resulted in the Langford pumping station and its one remaining engine, dating from 1931, becoming the fledgling Museum of Power. =South Essex Waterworks Company= The South Essex Waterworks Company was formed in 1861, and supplied drinking water to an area of stretching from Grays to East Ham and from Brentwood to the River Thames. Water was obtained from boreholes sunk into the chalk aquifer underlying the area, but by the time of the First World War, these supplies were not sufficient to meet the demand for water, and so the company looked further afield. Following the failure of the joint scheme with Southend Waterworks Company, they obtained an Act of Parliament in 1928South Essex Waterworks Act 1928 (18 & 19 Geo. 5 c. lxxix) for a revised scheme which included a water treatment works at Langham with an intake from the River Stour. Treated water was pumped from the works to Tiptree works, and was pumped from there to a reservoir at Danbury. It then flowed by gravity to another storage reservoir at Herongate and then into the distribution network. One condition of the Act was that the company had to supply water to other local authorities which were outside their original supply area. The 1930s style pump house at Abberton Reservoir Although the Langham works could supply per day, and came online in 1932, they estimated that they would still be facing a shortage by the end of the decade. The company obtained another Act of Parliament in 1935South Essex Waterworks Act 1935 (25 & 26 Geo. 5 c. xlviii) for a second abstraction point on the Stour. This was located at Stratford St. Mary, about downstream from the Langham intake. A pumping station pumped up to of water per day to the new Abberton Reservoir, and a new treatment works was built at Layer de la Haye near its northern shore. Treated water was pumped to Tiptree, where it was blended with water from Langham. The pipeline from Stratford St. Mary was long, while Abberton Reservoir covers an area of and lies in the valley of the Layer Brook. When full, it could hold . Layer treatment works could process per day, and the system was designed to store water from winter rainfall for use in the summer months. Construction of the reservoir began in March 1936 and continued until the start of the Second World War in 1939. To pass under the River Colne, shafts were constructed on either side of the river, and a diameter tunnel was excavated between the shafts. The miners worked in compressed air, and twin pipes of diameter were run through the tunnel. The original pipeline consisted of bitumen-lined steel tubes, some and some in diameter. A second pipeline of diameter pipes was subsequently installed. Filling of the reservoir began in 1939 and was completed by the end of 1940. Some minor commissioning work, including the Abberton pumping station, was delayed until the end of hostilities. The project cost ¬£500,000. Many of the construction workers came from Durham, and some stayed on to run the works, including Stanley Aldridge, who had been the Engineer, and became the General Manager of the Layer works. =Joint projects= The sluice on Kirtling Brook, where water from the Great Ouse is discharged from the Ely Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme into the River Stour system Although the Southend Waterworks Company and the South Essex Waterworks Company did not formally unite until 1970, they co-operated on two major projects prior to that date. These were the construction of Hanningfield Reservoir and the Ely-Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme. The construction of Hanningfield Reservoir, which was authorised by the Hanningfield Water Order 1950, and began in 1951, was a joint venture between the two companies. It was built in the Sandon Valley, to the north of Wickford, and covered the hamlet of Peasdown. A mass earth dam with a puddle clay core was built across the north-east edge of the site, and a new pipeline was built from the Langford pumping station to supply the reservoir. The main contractors for the project were W&C; French, and it took around 5 years to complete, with the treatment works beginning production in August 1956. The formal opening took place over a year later, when Henry Brooke, MP, the Minister of Housing and Local Government, performed the ceremony in September 1957. The total cost of the project was ¬£6 million, and when full, the reservoir can hold . If supplies around or treated water per day, although the maximum throughput of the works is per day. Water levels fluctuate seasonally, and during the winter months, up to per day are pumped into the reservoir via the Langford pipeline. In order to meet the rising demands for water faced by both companies, the next major project was the Ely-Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme. Surplus water in the River Great Ouse, which would otherwise flow into the sea, was to be diverted via a series of channels, tunnels and pipelines to augment supplies to the Abberton and Hanningfield reservoirs. At the northern end, the Cut Off Channel carries the headwaters of the River Lark, the River Little Ouse and the River Wissey to the Great Ouse at Denver Sluice, when those rivers are in flood. An intake was constructed at Blackdyke, close to the Little Ouse, and a tunnel carries the water to a pumping station at Kennett. From there a pipeline carries the water to Kirtling Green Outfall, where it enters Kirtling Brook, a tributary of the River Stour. Further down the Stour, some of the water is removed from the river by Wixoe pumping station. A diameter pipeline carries it to the Great Sampford outfall, where it is discharged into the River Pant, the name of the upper reaches of the River Blackwater. Construction of the scheme was completed in 1971. =Suffolk Water plc= The Great Yarmouth Waterworks Company was set up in 1853, authorised by the Great Yarmouth Waterworks Act of that year. They built a waterworks at Ormesby Broad, from where water flowed by gravity into Great Yarmouth. Two steam engines raised the water up to some filter beds. The construction of the distribution network of pipes through the town was completed in 1855, when the Ormesby Waterworks was opened. Public water supply in Lowestoft also began in 1853,The Lowestoft Water, Gas and Market Act 1853 (c. xviii) with the creation of the Lowestoft Water, Gas and Market Company. They retained this name until 1897, when they became the Lowestoft Water and Gas Company.The Lowestoft Water and Gas Act 1897 (c. cx) The company had an authorised capital of ¬£25,000, and bought the gas works for ¬£5,000. Water was supplied to a tower at Kirkley from a well at Middle West Field, and subsequently from a lake at Bunkers Hill, Lound. From there it was pumped through a pipeline to a covered reservoir located to the north of the town. Both the company and the Great Yarmouth company were finding that the supplies were inadequate for the populations of the two towns, particularly are there was a large seasonal tourist trade, and in 1906, they attempted to get authorisation for extracting water from the River Bure. The bill faced a rough passage through Parliament, as there were objections to parts of it from Norfolk County Council, the Great Yarmouth Corporation, the Great Yarmouth Court Commissioners, the London Drainage Commissioners, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England, and some private individuals. The chief concerns were that removing water from the Bure would impede navigation, and that the quality of the water would be poor, and unfit to supply as drinking water. However, the bill eventually became the Great Yarmouth Waterworks and Lowestoft Water and Gas Act 1907.The Great Yarmouth Water-works and Lowestoft Water and Gas Act 1907 (c. lxxxiv) The two companies amalgamated in 1962 to become the East Anglian Water Company. The merger was sanctioned by the East Anglian Water Order 1962,The East Anglian Water Order 1961 S.I. 1961/2291 using the powers of the Water Act 1945. By this time the Lowestoft Water and Gas Company was known as the Lowestoft Water Company, as all gas companies had been nationalised in 1948. A further change of name occurred on 18 January 1991, when it became Suffolk Water plc, and the new company was taken over by Essex Water on 8 April 1994, to become Essex and Suffolk Water. Both were owned by the French company at the time. =Essex and Suffolk Water= In order to provide improved supplies to Great Yarmouth, the company bought most of the Trinity Broads in 1995. These are isolated from the River Bure by a narrow channel, and have been further protected by the installation of a sluice gate. They were designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1998. Osmesby Works is situated by the side of Ormesby Broad, and can treat water from the broads. A second source of water is pumped some from the River Bure to the works. Parts of the works date from the 1930s, and others from the 1950s, but a major upgrade was completed in 2005, to enhance the treatment of water from the broads, which is affected by algal bloom for around a quarter of each year. In order to meet long term supply requirements, the company looked at several options, and in 1997 settled on expanding the capacity of Abberton Reservoir. After ten years of design work and a lengthy tendering process, work began in January 2010 on a project costed at ¬£150 million, to increase the capacity of the reservoir by 58 per cent, and to upgrade the capacity of the Ely-Ouse Essex Transfer Scheme. The clay core of the main dam was raised by , to allow the water level to be raised by , increasing the surface area of the reservoir from to . The original pumping station which pumped water to Layer de la Haye treatment works would have been submerged by the new water levels, and so had to be demolished and rebuilt at a higher level. In order to keep the system operational while this was being done, a temporary pumping station was built on the shore of the reservoir. The new station can deliver of raw water per day to the works. Other enhancements at the reservoir site included the construction of a new visitor centre for the Essex Wildlife Trust, and work on the B1026 causeway, which crossed the reservoir at a height where it would be below the level of the new water surface. With the capacity of the reservoir increased from , two new pipelines were constructed, to improve the transfer of water from the Ouse. The Ely Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme was licensed to allow per day to be transferred, but the pumps at the Kennett pumping station could not deliver this volume, and the maximum permitted discharge into the river at Kirtling Green was per day. As part of the upgrade, three additional pumps were installed at Kennett. Around of new underground pipeline was constructed from Kirtling Green in Suffolk, along the banks of the Stour to Wixoe, where the water discharges into the river. Most is in diameter, but this reduces to for the final , where the gradient is steeper. It can deliver an additional per day into the river system. Further down the river, a new pumping station was constructed at Wormingford, to remove the water from the river and pump it to Abberton. The pumping station pumps the water for approximately to a break tank, from where it can flow by gravity to the reservoir. Most of the two pipelines were installed using cut and cover techniques, but the southern pipeline passes under the River Colne and beneath the A12 road and the East Coast railway to the west of Colchester. Twin shafts, in diameter and deep were excavated, and of diameter bored tunnel passed under both the road and the railway. The pipeline was then laid through the tunnel and grouted in. The entire project was completed in 2014. Supply area The company supplies water to an area of in southeast Norfolk, east Suffolk, Essex and the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Havering and Redbridge in Greater London. The total population served is 1.8 million, through over 735,000 domestic connections and over 47,000 non-household connections. Essex and Suffolk is a 'water only' supplier, with sewerage services supplied by Anglian Water (Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk and part of Upminster) and Thames Water (Greater London and part of Brentwood).

This particular layer has several unique security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a determined adversary.  Network interface layer  The network interface layer, commonly referred to as the data link layer, is the physical interface between the host system and the network hardware. It defines how data packets are to be formatted for transmission and routings. Some common link layer protocols include IEEE 802.2 and X.25. The data link layer and its associated protocols govern the physical interface between the host computer and the network hardware. The goal of this layer is to provide reliable communications between hosts connected on a network. Some of the services provided by this layer of the network stack include: *Data Framing - Breaking up the data stream into individual frames or packets. *Checksums - Sending checksum data for each frame to enable the receiving node to determine whether or not the frame was received error-free. *Acknowledgment - Sending either a positive (data was received) or negative (data was not received but expected) acknowledgement from receiver to sender to ensure reliable data transmission. *Flow Control - Buffering data transmissions to ensure that a fast sender does not overwhelm a slower receiver.  Vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies  = Wired networks =  Content Address Memory (CAM) table exhaustion attack  The data link layer addresses data packets based on the destination hardware's physical Media Access Control (MAC) address. Switches within the network maintain Content Address Tables (CAMs) that maps the switch's ports to specific MAC addresses. These tables allow the switch to securely deliver the packet to its intended physical address only. Using the switch to connect only the systems that are communicating provides much greater security than a network hub, which broadcasts all traffic over all ports, allowing an eavesdropper to intercept and monitor all network traffic. A CAM Table Exhaustion Attack basically turns a switch into a hub. The attacker floods the CAM table with new MAC-to-port mappings until the table's fixed memory allotment is full. At this point the switch no longer knows how to deliver traffic based on a MAC-to-port mapping, and defaults to broadcasting traffic over all ports. An adversary is then able to intercept and monitor all network traffic traversing the switch to include passwords, emails, instant messages, etc. The CAM table-overflow attack can be mitigated by configuring port security on the switch. This option provides for either the specification of the MAC addresses on a particular switch port or the specification of the number of MAC addresses that can be learned by a switch port. When an invalid MAC address is detected on the port, the switch can either block the offending MAC address or shut down the port.  Address Routing Protocol (ARP) spoofing  At the data link layer a logical IP address assigned by the network layer is translated into a physical MAC address. In order to ensure reliable data communications all switches in the network must maintain up-to-date tables for mapping logical (IP) to physical (MAC) addresses. If a client or switch is unsure of the IP-to-MAC mapping of a data packet it receives it will send an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) message to the nearest switch asking for the MAC address associated with the particular IP address. Once this is accomplished the client or switch will update its table to reflect the new mapping. In an ARP spoofing attack the adversary broadcasts the IP address of the machine to be attacked along with its own MAC address. All neighboring switches will then update their mapping tables and begin transmitting data destined to the attacked system's IP address to the attacker's MAC address. Such an attack is commonly referred to as a \\"man in the middle\\" attack. Defenses against ARP spoofing generally rely on some form of certification or cross-checking of ARP responses. Uncertified ARP responses are blocked. These techniques may be integrated with the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server so that both dynamic and static IP addresses are certified. This capability may also be implemented in individual hosts or may be integrated into Ethernet switches or other network equipment.  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) starvation When a client system without an IP address enters a network it will request an IP address from the resident DHCP server. The DHCP server will reserve an IP address (so anyone else asking for one is not granted this one) and it will send that IP address to the device along with a lease identifying how long the address will be valid. Normally, from this point, the device will respond by confirming the IP address with the DHCP server and the DHCP server finally responds with an acknowledgement. In a DHCP starvation attack, once the adversary receives the IP address and the lease period from the DHCP server, the adversary does not respond with the confirmation. Instead, the adversary floods the DHCP server with IP address requests until all addresses within the server's address space have been reserved (exhausted). At this point, any hosts wishing to join the network will be denied access, resulting in a denial of service. The adversary can then set up a rogue DHCP server so that clients receive incorrect network settings and as a result transmit data to an attacker's machine. One method for mitigating this type of attack is to use the IP source guard feature available on many ethernet switches. The IP guard initially blocks all traffic except DHCP packets. When a client receives a valid IP address from the DHCP server the IP address and switch port relationship are bound in an Access Control List (ACL). The ACL then restricts traffic only to those IP addresses configured in the binding. = Wireless networks =  Hidden node attack  In a wireless network many hosts or nodes are sharing a common medium. If nodes A and B are both wireless laptop computers communicating in an office environment their physical separation may require that they communicate through a wireless access point. But only one device can transmit at a time in order to avoid packet collisions. Prior to transmitting, Node A sends out a Ready to Send (RTS) signal. If it is not receiving any other traffic the access point will broadcast a Clear to Send (CTS) signal over the network. Node A will then begin transmitting while Node B knows to hold off transmitting its data for the time being. Even though it cannot directly communicate with Node A, i.e. Node A is hidden, it knows to wait based on its communication with the access point. An attacker can exploit this functionality by flooding the network with CTS messages. Then every node assumes there is a hidden node trying to transmit and will hold its own transmissions, resulting in a denial of service. Preventing hidden node attacks requires a network tool such as NetEqualizer. Such a tool monitors access point traffic and develops a baseline level of traffic. Any spikes in CTS/RTS signals are assumed to be the result of a hidden node attack and are subsequently blocked.  De-auth (de-authentication) attack  Any client entering a wireless network must first authenticate with an access point (AP) and is thereafter associated with that access point. When the client leaves it sends a deauthentication, or deauth, message to disassociate itself with the access point. An attacker can send deauth messages to an access point tied to client IP addresses thereby knocking the users off-line and requiring continued re-authenticate, giving the attacker valuable insight into the reauthentication handshaking that occurs. To mitigate this attack, the access point can be set up to delay the effects of deauthentication or disassociation requests (e.g., by queuing such requests for 5‚Äì10 seconds) thereby giving the access point an opportunity to observe subsequent packets from the client. If a data packet arrives after a deauthentication or disassociation request is queued, that request is discarded since a legitimate client would never generate packets in that order.

As reigning double holders, the club's main aims for the 2002‚Äì03 season were to retain the Swiss Nationalliga A and cup titles. The third aim was to stay in the Champions League as long as possible and, if possible, to reach the group stage. Basel ended the domestic league season as runners-up and Swiss Cup winners. They also reached the second group stage of the Champions League. Overview As reigning champions, Basel were favourites to win the domestic championship title. They also entered the 2002‚Äì03 Champions League in the second qualifying round. Basel's biggest pre- season signings were Julio Hern√°n Rossi from Lugano, Antonio Esposito from St. √âtienne and Bernt Haas on loan from West Bromwich Albion. In the other direction, Massimo Ceccaroni retired from his professional career. Ceccaroni is still considered to be a cult figure in Basel, not only because of his loyalty to the club (having spent 25 years at the club) but because he never scored a goal in the top flight of Swiss football. Basel started the season of with various warm-up matches. Their opponent included teams from the Swiss lower league as well as teams from the USL Premier Development League, Major League Soccer and Brazil and PSV Eindhoven of the Netherlands. The Nationalliga A season began on 6 July 2002 with the game against Aarau and the Champions League qualifying started on 31 July with the away tie against ≈Ωilina. In the Swiss Cup, all the league teams were qualified for the round of 32 which was to take place on 22 February 2003. Campaign =Domestic league= The season started well for Basel and they were undefeated in their first seven matches, winning five and drawing two. The following two games were both lost and Basel slipped down in the league table, but they regrouped to win nine and draw two of the following eleven games. A 1‚Äì2 home defeat against Grasshoppers cost them the lead in the league table and Grasshoppers ended the league qualifying stage as table leaders at the winter break. In the championship playoff round Basel lost just two away games, but because both ties against Grasshoppers were drawn the Zurich-based club managed to snatch the title by a single point. =Domestic cup= In the round of 32 of the Swiss Cup, Basel won away at lower league team Yverdon-Sport. In the round of 16 and in the quarter-finals Basel eliminated Servette and Young Boys respectively. Lower league club Schaffhausen was defeated 3‚Äì0. The final against Neuch√¢tel Xamax was a one-sided affair: Basel won 6‚Äì0 and won the domestic cup. =Champions League= In the second qualifying round of the Champions League, Basel defeated Slovakian club ≈Ωilina 4‚Äì1. In the third qualifying round they faced Scottish giants Celtic. In the first leg, away at Celtic Park, the home side won 3‚Äì1. Basel were able to rescue the tie in the second leg at St. Jakob-Park, coming away with a 2‚Äì0 victory, to draw 3‚Äì3 on aggregate, Basel proceeding to the group stage on the away goals rule. Basel's success saw them become only the second Swiss team ever to play in the modern Champions League. In the group stage Basel were drawn into Group B along with Valencia, Liverpool and Spartak Moscow. Following a 2‚Äì0 home win against Spartak, Basel travelled to Anfield to claim a 1‚Äì1 draw against Liverpool. After two good results Basel were brought back down to earth by a 6‚Äì2 demolition at Valencia's Estadio Mestalla. However, they bounced back and held Valencia to a 2‚Äì2 draw in the next fixture. Basel were now sitting in second place in the group, but needing to win at least one of their last two games and needing Liverpool to fail to pick up more than two points. In matchday five, Liverpool lost 1‚Äì0 to Valencia and Basel won 2‚Äì0 against Spartak at the Luzhniki Stadium. Basel's place in the last 16 was all but secured, although they still had to make sure they did not lose to Liverpool in the last game of the first group stage. On the last matchday, Basel led 3‚Äì0 at half-time through goals from Julio Hern√°n Rossi, Christian Gim√©nez and Timoth√©e Atouba. Although Liverpool fought back to equalise the game at 3‚Äì3 in the second half, Basel qualified for the next round. In the last 16, Basel faced Manchester United, Juventus and Deportivo de La Coru√±a. They had a poor start, losing back-to-back games at home to Manchester United and away at Juventus. Basel managed to give themselves hope of reaching the quarter-finals by winning 1-0 home and away at Deportivo. Arguably two of Basel's greatest ever European games came next as they held Manchester United to a 1‚Äì1 draw at Old Trafford and claimed a 2‚Äì1 victory over Juventus at St. Jakob-Park. Despite being knock-out on tie-breaking criteria, Basel had achieved their seasons European aim.

Named after the Greek monk, St. Simeon of Trier, it is now a city museum in the former collegiate church‚Äôs buildings under the name, Stadtmuseum Simeonstift [City Museum of the Simeonstift]. The church was created in 1037. In 1028 Simeon of Trier settled at the Porta Nigra as a hermit. He was supposed to have walled himself up there at the gate‚Äôs east tower. After his death on 1 June 1035, he was buried in his room on the ground floor. In the same year, probably for Christmas, he was canonized by Pope Benedict IX, in one of the first canonizations ever made by a Pope. In honor of the new saint, they built the Simeonstift and converted the former tower to a Doppelkirche [German, ‚Äútwin church‚Äù]. The Archbishop of Trier at that time, Poppo von Babenberg, personally had known the hermit and travelled with him. But a certificate of incorporation of the Simeonstift could not be obtained from him and it was probably never given. However, recent research showed that the church was founded soon after the canonization of Simeon. The Simeonstift was a two-story cloister in four wings with a dormitory in the north wing and a refectory in the west wing. According to the dendrochronological findings, the north wing dates from 1040. The first reliable documentation is a document of 1048, which proves the existence of a provost‚Äôs office and therefore the existence of an collegiate church‚Äôs charter. Emperor Henry IV in 1098 confirmed all his possessions to the Simeonstift and granted, namely, more than sixty properties and privileges to it.(de) Heinrich Beyer: Mittelrheinisches Urkundenbuch [Book of the Middle Rhine Records], Volume 1, page 452, Document No. 397 The doppelkirche conversion of the Porta Nigra was reversed more than 750 years later, in 1804, by the order of Napoleon. Since then, the city gate has reverted almost to its original Gallo-Roman condition. Only the Romanesque east side of the choir still testifies from the outside to the fact that the Porta Nigra was once an imposing church.

It involved ritual drawings with a variety of powdered cereals to counter different threats and is accompanied by the gloss: SAG.BA SAG.BA, Akkadian: mƒÅmƒ´t mƒÅmƒ´t, the curse from a broken oath, in the Exorcists Manual, where it refers to a specific ritual on two tablets the first of which is extant. The ritual The zisurr√ª, a word ultimately derived from Sumerian, was used as a defensive measure and drawn on the ground around prophylactic figurines as part of a Babylonian ritual to thwart evil spirits, around a patient's bed to protect against ghosts or demons in much the same manner in which bowls thwart demons and curses, or as a component of another elaborate ritual. It was a component in the Ritual and Incantation-Prayer against Ghost-Induced Illness: ≈†ama≈°, and also the M√Æs-p√Æ ritual. In the ritual tablet of the Maql√ª incantation series, it instructs ‚ÄúThereafter, you encircle the bed with flour-paste and recite the incantation sag.ba sag.ba and the incantation tummu bƒ´tu (‚ÄúAdjured is the house‚Äù).‚Äù It occurs in a namburbi performed when preparing to dig a new well and appended to tablet seventeen of the ≈†umma ƒÅlu series. It is incorporated into the Kettledrum rituals, where the circle of flour surrounds the bull whose hide is to form the drum skin. The encipit √©n sag.ba sag.ba also appears in the Mu≈°≈°u‚Äôu ritual tablet, line thirty-eight. The circle is rationalized in commentaries as representing certain protective deities, LUGAL.GIR.RA and Meslamtae‚Äôa according to one. In other rituals a circle might be painted in whitewash or dark wash on either side of a doorway for apotropaic purposes. The choice of flour was crucial to the purpose of the ritual, with ≈°emu≈°-flour reserved (n√≠ƒù-gig) for repelling ghosts, wheat-flour for rituals invoking personal gods and ≈°enu·∏´a-barley to encircle beds, presumably to counter disease-carrying demons. In the ritual against broken oaths, a catalogue from A≈°≈°ur gives the incipits of the two tablets as √©n (abbreviation for √©n √©-nu-ru) sag-ba sag-ba and √©n sag-ba min sil7-l√°-d√®. The colophon line of the first of these tablets, which has been recovered, reads KA-INIM-ma Z√å-≈†UR-ra NIG-·∏™UL-G√ÅL B√öR.RU.DA-kam.

It is located at the corner of F and Main Street in Clifton, Colorado, a town approximately five miles east of Grand Junction, Colorado. History =Origins and Construction= The structure was built in 1920 under the supervision of Reverend Clark Bower, who had formed the Christian Church in 1910. The church was important to the area as it hosted many of the local events. The church is specifically designed for this purpose; to be large enough for both religious meetings and for community events. The center was used for religious meetings, theater productions, harvest festivals, and all local school graduations (as there were no school auditoriums in Clifton in those days). The center was also utilized by local politicians to make speeches, as they knew they would have a large majority of the local community gathered there to hear their messages. =Fundraiser= On January 19, 1921, a fundraiser was held for the church to pay off the debt incurred by the construction of the structure. In total, members of the congregation and local community raised $34,000. This was a major achievement for a community not known for a great deal of wealth. News of this accomplishment traveled around Mesa County. $34,000 in 1921 when adjusted for inflation would be the equivalent of $487,005 in 2020.https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/ Reverend Clark Bower went on to pursue a political career, serving in 1939 as Chaplain of the Colorado House of Representatives.

When describing Clifton Community Center and Church, Pat Knight of the US National Park Service stated: ‚Ä≥The church is approximately 4000 square feet on the main floor, 4000 on the basement floor and 2000 in the balcony. It has a cross^-gabled roof with plain boxed cornice roof trim on the front and back gables, and decorated side gables. The decorative head above the upper floor doors is double recessed paneled with a plain pediment above each. The staircases leading to the doors have concrete railings. The four doors leading to the basement floor are located below the staircases. Twelve windows, three on each facade, are arcaded with the original stained, leaded glass and hinged openings. The forty remaining windows have plain glass with hinged openings. The exterior walls consist of mesh metal lathe covered with a stucco mixture of cinder and cement which has been preserved remarkably well in its original state for the past sixty years.

For world competitions it was reorganized into under-20 team. It ceased to exist on the breakup of the Union. It was the oldest existing junior national football team until 1972 with introduction of the national under-23 team. Following the realignment of UEFA's youth competitions in 1962, the USSR Under-18 team was formed. The competition has been held since 1948. It was originally called the FIFA junior tournament, until it was taken over by UEFA in 1955 (UEFA Junior Tournament). In 1980, UEFA competitions for under-18 teams were officially restyled as the European Under 18 Football Championship. The team had a good record, winning the competition sixth times, reaching the final once, but failing to qualify for the last five on 26 occasions. After the dissolution of the USSR (on December 26, 1991), the senior team played out its remaining fixtures, which were the finals of Euro 92. Because the USSR U-18s had, by December 26, already failed to qualify for their version of the 1992 European Championship, the former Soviet states didn't play as a combined team at U-19 level ever again. Of the former Soviet states, only Russia was admitted for the 1992‚Äì1993 competition.

Biography  Born in Chalkis in 1882, Dimitrios Katheniotis entered the Hellenic Army Academy in 1901 and graduated on 8 July 1904 as an artillery second lieutenant. Promoted to lieutenant in 1910, he took part in the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13 as a staff officer in the 7th Infantry Division. In 1913 he was promoted to captain, and in 1915 to major. In September 1916 he joined the Venizelist Movement of National Defence in Thessaloniki, which in opposition to the royal government in Athens entered World War I on the side of the Entente. In 1916‚Äì17 he served as chief of staff to the newly raised Archipelago Division, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1917. In 1918, he was appointed as the liaison between the Greek Army's staff service and the Allied commander-in-chief in the Macedonian front, French general Adolphe Guillaumat. Following the Armistice of Mudros, Katheniotis, from 1919 a full colonel, was sent by the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos to the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, where he became involved in the contacts of the Greek government with the Pontic Greeks who inhabited parts of north-eastern Anatolia, and their aspirations for independence from the rump Ottoman state. His report on the Pontic issue, however, pointed out that any thought of a union with Greece, or the establishment of an independent \\"Republic of Pontus\\", were unfeasible, and recommended the co-operation of the Pontians with newly independent Armenia in a confederative state. Like many Venizelist officers, he was dismissed from the Army in November 1920 following the Venizelist electoral defeat. Following the disastrous defeat of the Greek army in Anatolia by the Turkish nationalist forces in August 1922 and the subsequent outbreak of a military revolt, he was recalled to active service by the new revolutionary government, and appointed as CO of the Adrianople Division and then of the 11th Infantry Division. In 1924, he was promoted to major general, and served in succession as Deputy Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff, commandant of the Supreme War Academy, and military attach√© in Paris. On 15 July 1933, he was promoted to lieutenant general and named chief of the Army General Staff, a position he held until his retirement in 1935, following the failed Venizelist coup attempt in March. Katheniotis was married and had a daughter. He died on 23 February 1947.

At first Randle focused on history and the social sciences, which allowed young academics to publish their findings locally. As a result, the region became less dependent on writers from the United Kingdom, the colonizer of Jamaica until 1962. In later years Randle expanded the range of books to include biography, culture, cookery, and sports, while producing texts for undergraduate-level students and the upper levels of the Caribbean secondary school system. His list contains the most comprehensive offerings on the Regional Integration Movement and on the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). His published list contains over 350 printed titles and some electronic editions. The direction of the firm is now in the hands of Randle's daughter Christine, while he himself has continued in fields such as marketing, public relations and consultancy. In 2000 Randle helped establish the Caribbean Publishers Network (CAPNET) and became its first president, serving for two two-year terms, during which he established links with the international publishing community and with publishers in Africa through the sister organization APNET. During this period Randle contributed regularly to the University of Denver Publishing Institute delivering the annual lecture on international publishing and presenting papers in a variety of international publishing and education fora.  Recognition  His pioneering work was recognized by the government of Jamaica when he was conferred with the Order of Distinction in 2002. In 2012 Randle was honoured with a Prince Claus Award from the Netherlands for his contribution to Caribbean intellectual property and for championing independent local publishing and self-representation in other post-colonial contexts.\\"Jamaica Selected for Prince Claus Award\\", Jamaica Television, 3 October 2010.

The Concern includes enterprises which operate in development, manufacture, sale, repair, modernization and disposal of weapons, military and special equipment and ammunition, and participating in military- technical cooperation with foreign states. The organisation has the functions of strategic planning, interaction with public authorities and coordination with divisions. This approach allows the top management of the organisation to focus on strategic decisions and long-term programs of the defense industry. According to multiple reports the level of corruption in Ukroboronprom remains very high even in comparison with other parts of Ukrainian defence sector.Ukraine‚Äôs Toughest Fight: The Challenge of Military Reform The systemic corruption in Ukroboronprom reached such a high level that it undermines relationship of Ukraine with its most important supporters.Ukraine‚Äôs Anti- Corruption Agency Alleges Fraud in Arms Industry  History  ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù was created by the decrees of the President of Ukraine of 9.12.2010 ‚Ññ 1085/2010 and 28.12.2010 ‚Ññ 1245/2010, as well as decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers of 29.12.2010 ‚Ññ 1221 and 31.08.2011 ‚Ññ 993. The main goal of ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù is the efficient management of Ukrainian military industrial sector and improvement of the effectiveness of the enterprises that are parts of State Concern. In September 2013, five divisions were created in the structure of ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù: aircraft industry and aircraft maintenance; precision weaponry and munition; armored vehicles, automotive equipment, engineering and special equipment; shipbuilding and marine facilities; radar, radio communications and air defense systems. As separate divisions stand those, that are authorized to conduct import/export operations with military equipment and wares that hold National Security information. These enterprises conduct international sales of equipment produced by Ukrainian military industrial sector and post-sales service of equipment, maintenance, and modernization. Roman Romanov, who graduated from the International Institute of Management (MiM-Kyiv) and has an MBA degree, headed ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù since 4 June 2014. As a result of his activity, ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù finally became profitable by the end of 2014. At the end-year 2014 ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù fulfilled all government contracts by 100%. During the second half of the year 2014, the enterprises of the Concern created more than 2000 jobs and 13 more enterprises became profitable. Moreover, over the second half of the year wage arrears to employees totaling to 45 million UAH were overtaken. On 26 August 2016, ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù signed a memorandum of cooperation with the former head of the Agency for Defense Advanced Research Projects (DARPA) Anthony Tetter. He became an advisor on the long-term development of ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù. ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù was the first among Ukrainian industrial giants to launch the system of e-procurement. Its official start was in October 2014. By the results of 2015, the company saved 304.8 million USD, and in 2016 ‚Äì 476.6 million UAH. Managed by its new Director Roman Romanov, Ukroboronprom increased its production by several times and started to provide systematically Ukraine's Armed Forces with the newest weaponry. In 2017, ¬´Ukroboronprom¬ª has fully completed the State Defense Order and conveyed 3 673 units of weapons and equipment to the security agencies of the country, including 2 053 new and upgraded ones. For 2014-2017, \\"Ukroboronprom\\" has risen by 14 positions ‚Äì from 91 to 77th place ‚Äì in the SIPRI world ranking of arms manufacturers. \\"Ukroboronprom\\" together with the American company Delphi Corporation has launched a new enterprise \\"Electric Systems\\". It has become the official supplier of components for Mercedes products. The Cyber Guard project from \\"Ukroboronprom\\" became the general partner of the cyberforum HackIT-2017.

The feasibility of combining in a single management structure of scientific, experimental, industrial enterprises and special exporters is supported by the positive effect, that the Concern has shown during its existence. Formation of ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù made available organization of an innovation cycle \\"research - development - serial production - consumption (sales) - service - utilization\\". To ensure optimal decision- making in different fields the State Concern uses a concept of divisional management structure. The concept was adopted taking into account current trends in theory and practice of management. Its essence is to separate strategic and operational objectives from industry operational problems management. A divisional principle is to provide administrative and economic \\"autonomy\\" of industries, a delegation of administrative powers of heads of divisions.

The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize,http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13022/touchy_feely and was released on September 6, 2013. It gained a mixed critical reception, and grossed over $36,000 in the United States.  Plot  Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt), a massage therapist, develops an aversion to skin shortly after her boyfriend Jesse (Scoot McNairy) asks her to move in with him. She takes a temporary leave of absence from work. Her disgust begins to affect her relationship with Jesse, as she cannot bring herself to touch him or be touched. After her suggestion that they take ecstasy together in order to help her relax goes awry, Abby decides not to move in with Jesse. Abby's brother Paul (Josh Pais) struggles financially as the family dentistry practice is crumbling and his risk-averse attitude means he refuses to seek out new patients. When his daughter Jenny (Ellen Page) invites her friend Henry in for a routine teeth-cleaning, Paul is displeased. However, Paul manages to accidentally cure Henry's temporomandibular joint dysfunction and news of his healing powers begins to attract new clients. Inspired by the outpouring of enthusiasm from his patients, he visits Abby's friend Bronwyn in order to learn Reiki to better help his clients. However, after a disgruntled ex-client collapses in the waiting room while screaming that Paul is a fraud, his fortunes reverse and his patients disappear. Upset at watching her father revert to his former self, Jenny runs out of the office crying. Abby leaves Jesse a break-up note and moves in with her brother. She takes ecstasy alone and while wandering outdoors meets her ex-boyfriend, Adrian (Ron Livingston). He takes her to his grandmother's home; while there she is able to touch him. Paul finds another ecstasy tablet and he takes it while he waits for Jenny to contact him. He wanders through the city, eventually ending up at Bronwyn's home, where they kiss. Jenny goes to Jesse's apartment and invites him to attend a music concert with her. Afterwards, they go back to his apartment, where Jenny asks him to kiss her; he refuses, telling her he loves Abby. Jenny falls asleep at his home. The next morning they are awoken by a knock at the door from Abby, who is able to hug Jesse.  Cast  * Rosemarie DeWitt as Abby * Ellen Page as Jenny * Josh Pais as Paul * Allison Janney as Bronwyn * Ron Livingston as Adrian * Scoot McNairy as Jesse * Tomo Nakayama as Henry  Production  Director Lynn Shelton's friend Megan Griffiths suggested the title after Shelton described her idea for the film over lunch.

In traditional economics, appropriation is a non-violent process that is guaranteed by perfect property rights and their costless enforcement. Conflict economics sheds a different light on appropriation. It is set in a model of contest between two players. Conflict economics introduces the idea that agents have to decide between production of resources and production of guns, i.e. tools that have the sole purposes of appropriating the resources produced by the other player. Different models are introduced to illustrate various situations that have similarities to real life conflicts. Resource conflict model Two parties contest a given resource Z. The player who wins the contest claims the entire resource, not leaving anything for the losing party. The probabilities of winning are determined by each party‚Äôs choice of guns. Guns vs. butter model In this model, agents face a trade-off between producing themselves and grabbing the output of the other agent. Each party is endowed with a secure resource R. The resource cannot be consumed directly but has to be allocated between producing guns (tools for conflict) or butter (consumption). Again, the probability of winning the contest and grabbing the other output depend on the relative numbers of guns produced. This model allows testing of different power structures between the players. One of the interesting outcomes is that if one agent has higher productivity, i.e. if he uses one unit of the resource he will gain more butter than his opponent would, he will receive a relatively lower expected pay-off. This is due to the fact that each player will then exploit his or her comparative advantage, with the more productive player producing more butter and the less productive player producing more guns, resulting in a higher chance of winning the conflict thus leading to a higher expected pay-off. Settlement in the shadow of conflict Conflict is not the only way that parties can appropriate resources. Depending on the risk preferences of the agents, a simple division of the contested resource according to a settlement can be envisioned. A two- stage game serves to illustrate this. In the first stage, parties make their gun choices. In the second stage, negotiations take place. If the negotiations are successful, the players agree on a division and share the good. If the negotiations are not successful, conflict ensues with the winning party again taking the whole resource. This two-stage model is especially interesting if one includes the possibility of destruction into the model, i.e. in case of conflict the winner is left with only a part of the contested resource. Parties might prefer settlement over conflict if they have an aversion to uncertainty (outcome of conflict dependent on probabilities) or destruction. However, in the long term conflict might be the dominant strategy. Introducing a discount rate for payoffs in the future might induce players to start conflict in the present. Defeating your opponent in the present will secure the resource for you in the future (opponent is eliminated), thus not having to share it in a settlement. Conflict, alliances and group structures Conflict might not occur between two agents only, but a number of agents can be involved in hostilities. Individuals and parties have been repeatedly proven to form alliances to achieve a common goal. There are cost advantages to be realized or the sum of individual efforts creates synergies that cannot be realized by individuals on their own. However one has to keep in mind that if individuals work together there are always incentives for \\"free riding.\\" In conflict economics, group conflict builds upon the resource conflict model. A two-stage game is constructed. In the first stage (inter-group conflict) groups and individuals compete for the resource. The probabilities of winning depend on the effort, i.e. number of guns, that individuals are contributing to the group. In the second stage (intra-group conflict) the successful group allocates the won resource among its members. This allocation can be according to the efforts that individuals spent, contracts or just an equal distribution according to the number of members. However group structures have been found to be more unstable the higher the number of individuals there are in the group. Individuals have higher expected payoff by switching to a group with less individuals or forming a stand-alone alliance. For alliances to be stable they have to be roughly the same sizes or symmetric.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the appointment of the sitting Liberal MP, Arthur Dewar KC, who was the Solicitor General for Scotland, as a Senator of the College of Justice. Electoral history Dewar had first been elected as MP for Edinburgh South in a by-election in June 1899.The Times, 20 June 1899 p10 He lost the seat narrowly at the general election of 1900 but won it back in 1906, holding it in January 1910.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885-1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 pp499 Candidates The Liberals first choice for the seat was Dr Edward Parrott. Parrott, a publisher and author, was chairman of the Edinburgh South Liberal Association and also of the Edinburgh United Liberal Committee.Who was Who; OUP online, 2007 At a meeting on 11 April, the local executive of the Liberal Association met to consider who the candidate should be, assuming Dewar was to be appointed to the College of Justice. Parrott asked for 48 hours to think the offer over The Times, 12 April 1910 p12 but turned it down and the committee instead turned to Charles Lyell a 34-year-old professional politician, as their preferred candidate.The Times, 19 April 1910 p10 Lyell had been MP for East Dorset from 1904 till January 1910. During that time he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary. He switched seats in January 1910, leaving the marginal East Dorset to Freddie Guest (Guest had family connections in the county) and taking on instead the usually Unionist seat of Edinburgh West, which he failed to gain.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885-1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 pp263&500 The Unionist candidate in the previous general election had been Harold Cox, an Edinburgh businessman but he ruled himself out as a possible candidate for the by-election on medical advice.The Times, 19 April 1910 p10 The Unionists then turned to 25-year-old Ralph Campbell Glyn, the only son of the Bishop of Peterborough whose mother was the sister of the Duke of Argyll.The Times, 20 April 1910 p8 Glyn had been the Liberal Unionist candidate in Elginshire and Nairnshire at the January 1910 election.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885-1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p538 Campaign An early issue in the campaign was the question of House of Lords reform. This had been brought to a head by Lloyd George‚Äôs People‚Äôs Budget of 1909. Lloyd George‚Äôs radical tax raising proposals and plans to finance social provisions such as old age pensions meant his budget was rejected by the landed majority in the House of Lords against the convention that the Lords would not reject financial bills. This sparked a constitutional crisis and provoked the January 1910 general election. The issue was therefore still high on the political agenda and Glyn made it the centrepiece of his adoption meeting on 20 April. He said he was in favour of reforming the House of Lords but could not bring himself to attack its recent actions. He said the best party to reform the Lords was what he described as the Constitutional party i.e. the Conservatives. Constitutional reform should not be rushed and the Tories said Glyn were the best placed to consider this matter as they may have been slow but had always been sure.The Times, 21 April 1910 p8 This position was reinforced by the letter of support which Glyn received from the Conservative leader Arthur Balfour. In it, Balfour wrote that the present government desired a revolution, not he said against the House of Lords, but against the British people. In his letter Balfour contended that there were many evils associated with the reform of the Lords, including the postponement of the very social reforms which the Liberal government wished to implement. It is not in an atmosphere of revolutionary controversy, he wrote, that healthy legislation on such subjects can be secured.The Times, 28 April 1910 p8 Asquith‚Äôs letter of support to Lyell was less colourful simply referring to the great constitutional struggle which the country and the party was engaged in and anticipating another clear Liberal win in the constituency. Result Lyell held the seat for the Liberals with a majority of 2,327 votes over Glyn. This compared with an almost identical majority of 2,334 at the previous general election. While turnout was down between the general election and by-election, the share of the poll each party received was broadly the same. It seems issues the electorate felt were important enough to vote for in January had not changed by April and neither did the Liberals suffer from voter impatience at being asked to turn out for what may have seemed like an unnecessary election, as sometimes happens when sitting MPs stand down close to general elections. Aftermath The Liberal held the seat at the following General Election. Glyn was elected MP for Clackmannan and Eastern Stirlingshire in 1918.

As an artist she researches the social causes and consequences of death.Prince Claus Fund (June 2012) Report from the 2012 Prince Claus Awards Committee Margolles communicates observations from the morgue in her home city, Mexico City, and other morgues located in Latin America, as well as the extended emotional distress and social consequences that occur as product of death by murder. While working around the topic of the body, her work extends to the families of the victims, the remaining living bodies that witness the death of a loved one. The main medium of her work comes from the morgues themselves, which she transforms into sensory experiences that provoke a feeling of memory to the audience. Margolles finds particularly remarkable how the activity inside the morgues reflects the truth from the outside. In the case of Mexico City, she observes that the majority of victims belong to the lower classes. \\"Looking at the dead you see society\\".  Life  Margolles was born in Culiac√°n, Mexico, in 1963. She originally trained as a forensic pathologist, and holds diplomas in science of communication and forensic medicine from Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, as well as studying art at the Direccion de Fomento a la Cultura Regional del Estado de Sinaloa, Culiacan, Mexico. For her the morgue reflects society, particularly Mexican urban experience, where drug-related crime, poverty, political upheaval, and military action have resulted in violence and death; > \\"The work of Teresa Margolles has always taken the human body and its liquid > components as protagonists; they serve as vehicles for a relentless > indictment of the growing violence in the world at large and in her own > native country in particular, namely Mexico.\\" Letizia Ragaglia, 2011 \\"When I > was working with SEMEFO I was very interested in what was happening inside > the morgue and the situations that were occurring, let's say, a few meters > outside the morgue, among family members and relatives. But Mexico has > changed so violently that it's no longer possible to describe what's > happening outside from within the morgue. The pain, loss and emptiness are > now found in the streets.\\" Teresa Margolles 2009 In 1990, Margolles founded an artists' collective titled SEMEFO, which is an anagram for the Mexican coroner's office. Other core members of SEMEFO included Arturo Angulo and Carlos Lopez, yet the group had a loose membership. Through performance and installation-based work, SEMEFO commented on social violence and death in Mexico. Margolles left SEMEFO in the late 1990s. Since then her independent art practice continues to explore themes of death, violence and exclusion, specifically using forensic material and human remains. She uses materials retrieved from the morgue where she has her studio, such as the water used to wash corpses, which she uses as the foundation for her work; > \\"The water comes from Mexico City‚Äôs morgue. It‚Äôs water used to wash the > bodies of murder victims.\\" Teresea Margolles, 2006 In 2012 she was honored with a Prince Claus Award from the Netherlands and the 5th Artes Mundi prize for international contemporary art.

History It was written and recorded in Lisbon, Portugal in 1997, (where Ithaka lived and worked between 1992 and 1998) and is based upon his own personal adventures in Western Europe. Lyrically the record covers many diverse topics such as Substance abuse, Big wave surfing, and Ghosts. Songwriter-vocalist, Ithaka Darin Pappas, recording \\"Seabra Is Mad\\" at Valentim de Carvalho Studios in Lisbon, Portugal. Although the album is the English language, it was nominated for four Blitz Premios (The Portuguese version of The Grammy Awards) and in 1997 received top honours in the respected Portuguese newspaper Jornal P√∫blico (Portugal) for \\"Best Song\\" Seabra Is Mad, \\"Best Video\\"(Seabra Is Mad), \\"Artist Of The Year\\" and \\"Album Of The Year\\". Songs from this album later appeared on the hit 2007 Xbox 360 basketball game, \\"NBA 2K7\\" from the NBA 2K (series) and on the soundtrack for the American surfing movie \\"Second Thoughts\\", winner of the 2004 Surfer (magazine) Reader's Poll Award for \\"Best Video\\".http://mp3indirem.com/album/271621963/ithaka-chasing-the-lotus- soundtrack-from-the-motion-picture.html The album was produced by Joe Fossard and consists of seventeen tracks which feature many guests performers such as British guitarist and co-producer Ewan Butler, singer Marta Dias, rapper Ace (from Mind Da Gap), rapper X-Sista, singer Hi-Fi J√¥, singer Mimi and others from Portugal and beyond. Although Ithaka is an American citizen of Greek origins, because Stellafly was made in Portugal and utilized many Portuguese guest artists, it (and Ithaka's preceding album, Flowers And The Color Of Paint) is often included in the genre of music known as Hip hop Tuga along with artists such as General D, Boss AC, etc. Cover photograph The album's original cover image was created by Ithaka Darin Pappas himself; a photograph of a woman wearing a chicken wire swimsuit in front of the sculpture (also called Stellafly) from his body of artwork called, The Reincarnation Of A Surfboard.

Presidents The old campus of Furman University, prior to its relocation under the presidency of John Laney Plyler. This temple was transported from Nagoya to Furman University in 2004, under the presidency of David Shi. *1. James Clement Furman was elected the first president of Furman University in 1859. He served for twenty years, until 1879. His grave at the Springwood Cemetery in Greenville states: \\"For 46 years he labored in the cause of Christian Education\\".Rev James Clement Furman, Memorial. https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9321867/james-clement-furman *2. Charles Manly served as president from 1859 to 1879. He was a Baptist minister. Manly Hall (built in 1956) is named after him. He is credited for allowing the campus to become more residential, in contrast to previous administrators who did not favor dormitories.Courtney L. Tollison, Furman University. Arcadia Publishing, 2004. pp.25 *3. Andrew Philip Montague was president for five years, from 1897 to 1902. While his two predecessors were involved in Christian life prior to being presidents, Montague was dean at Columbia University. *4. Charles Hallette Judson was Acting President over a year, from 1902 to 1903. Prior to this, he was president of the Greenville Woman's College. *5. Edwin McNeill Poteat strengthened the university in many ways during his fifteen years presidency, from 1903 to 1918. He encouraged the recruiting of faculty with advanced degrees, including the first PhD to be hired at Furman, Sidney Ernest Bradshaw. *6. After the previous president resigned to pursue mission work in China, Sidney Ernest Bradshaw became interim president for one year (1918-1919) while the board of trustees prepared to hire the next president. *7. William Joseph McGlothlin, a professor of church history, came from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminar in 1919 to serve as President at Furman, where he remained in this post until 1933.Carl Wilkinson, The Life and Work of William Joseph McGlothlin, Ph.D. diss., The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, 1980. (1919-1933) *8. Bennette Eugene Geer, also known as 'Ben Geer', became president in 1933. His friendship with James Buchanan Duke was instrumental to name Furman as a beneficiary of the Duke Endowment. In the terms of the endowment, Furman was referred to as \\"that little college located in Greenville that Ben Geer is such a fool about\\".Courtney L. Tollison, Furman University. Arcadia Publishing, 2004. pp.27 Geer was a graduate of Furman, and as such, the first Furman graduate to assume the presidency. Financial support progressed under Geer's presidency, echoing his own times when he was able to afford education at Furman in part thanks to living in the house of then president Manly. His presidency ended in 1938. *9. Robert Norman Daniel was Acting President during the remainder of the year 1938. *10. John Laney Plyler oversaw a transformation of Furman during a long lasting presidency of 25 years, from 1939 to 1964. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Furman University, and was trained at the Harvard Law School. Under his presidency, land was bought for the new campus and Furman moved from downtown Greenville to its current location. *11. Gordon Williams Blackwell, was the president of Florida State University, who then came as the new President of Furman in 1965. His interest in excellence by national standards contributed to start the transformation of Furman as a higher education institute of national stature, as it is still categorized today (among national liberal arts universities). His term ended after ten years, in 1976. *12. John Edwin Johns, was president of Furman from 1976 to 1994. He had a distinguished military career with several military honors (e.g., Flying Cross, Air Medal) and flew 35 combat missions in Europe during World War II aboard a B-17 aircraft. A graduate of Furman, he received a PhD in history from the University of North Carolina. After a long academic career at Stetson University culminating in its presidency, he joined Furman as president and grew the university's endowment tenfold through capital campaigns.Obituary of John Jones.

The signal caused by low moisture in the air is first induced by the stomata of leaves and transferred to other cells and tissues, which upregulate the expression of the AtNCED3 gene and ABA synthesis. Stomata closure limits various processes, including air exchange, water loss and O2 release. The AtNCED3 gene is active and expressed under these circumstances. Accumulation of AtNCED3 mRNA and AtNCED3 protein was first found in the vascular parenchyma cells under drought stress, which suggested that plant drought tolerance relates to the development of plant vascular tissue. Also, overexpression of AtNCED3 gene can improve plant salt tolerance.

Prior to the Revolution, Hamilton was a successful merchant in Halifax, North Carolina, with business interests throughout the Province of North Carolina. Hamilton commanded soldiers in several major engagements, including the battles of Briar Creek, Camden, Guilford Courthouse, and Yorktown. After the conclusion of the war, Hamilton was made British consul to Norfolk, Virginia, one of only three Loyalists to receive consular positions in the newly created United States. Early life and business Born in Scotland, Hamilton immigrated to Nansemond County, Virginia at some point prior to 1760, where other members of his family had already established businesses. Hamilton formed a partnership with two of his brothers, Archibald and William, who had set up a trading center near Halifax in North Carolina. Hamilton's venture extended credit to a number of planters throughout the burgeoning Piedmont region of the province, which has been cited as a major factor in that region's development during the colonial era. Much of the firm's activities relied on regular trade with and credit from the rest of the British empire, and so the beginning of the American Revolution signalled the end of Hamilton's commercial successes. American Revolution In August 1777, Hamilton refused to take an oath of allegiance to the newly formed state of North Carolina. Due to the animosity against him for his Loyalist beliefs, Hamilton was forced to wind down his business activities in the state, and eventually left from New Bern on October 25, 1777 aboard a newly purchased merchant ship. According to a later accounting generated by Hamilton and his brother, their business suffered approximately ¬£200,000 in losses due to the Revolution. Hamilton arrived in British-controlled New York and served as a courier in the British Army for Generals William Howe and Henry Clinton before being authorized a commission as an officer to recruit Loyalist soldiers in the southern theater. Hamilton's rank would be dependent upon the number of men he would be able to recruit. The recruitment process began after the British Capture of Savannah, when Hamilton recruited approximately 30 Loyalist survivors of the battle of Kettle Creek, Georgia to serve as the basis for his regiment of \\"North Carolina Volunteers\\". Eventually the unit was named the Royal North Carolina Regiment, and had eventually had as many as men. Hamilton and his regiment saw action at the Siege of Savannah, as well as the battles of Briar Creek, Kettle Creek (Hamilton may have meant only the battle of Carr's fort that preceded Kettle Creek), Stono Ferry, Monck's Corner, Hanging Rock, Camden, and the Guilford Courthouse. Hamilton lost a pair of pistols to Colonel Andrew Pickens at the battle at Carr's fort on February 10, 1779. Today those pistols are on display at the Museum of Art and History in Pickens, South Carolina. At Briar Creek on March 3, 1779, Hamilton recovered a pair of distinctive riding boots belonging to Patriot militia general and fellow North Carolinian Thomas Eaton, who had lost them in that battle. When Hamilton attempted to return the boots to Eaton at a dinner party in 1809, Eaton responded violently, reportedly beating the Loyalist with the very same boots. During the confrontation at Stono Ferry on June 20, 1779, Hamilton commanded his regiment at the center of the British line, behind redoubts set up to protect the withdrawal of the main British Army. Hamilton's Royal North Carolina Regiment held firm along with the 71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot, and dealt a defeat to the attacking Continental Army forces commanded by Benjamin Lincoln. At Hanging Rock, though, Hamilton's regiment was routed during the initial Patriot attack, but he rallied his command for an attempted stand along with other Loyalist units. The rallied Loyalist units were dispersed by a cavalry charge commanded by militia leader William Richardson Davie, and the Patriot forces were permitted to ransack the British camp. Hamilton surrendered his regiment, with 80 of its 142 survivors, after the Siege of Yorktown. After his surrender, Hamilton was sent to Saint Augustine in British Florida. When Florida was ceded to Spain in the Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolutionary War, Hamilton quashed talks of mutiny among the Loyalist soldiers and residents of British Florida, who sought to remain there under British rule and were then evacuated to Nova Scotia. In the course of his service in the Revolutionary War, Hamilton was wounded three times. General Charles Cornwallis, who had at one point during the war called Hamilton a \\"blockhead\\", would later commend Hamilton for his conduct and service to the British Army. Post-war career and death The Royal North Carolina Regiment was disbanded in November 1783, and Hamilton went to London. At some point prior to 1785, Hamilton married and had one child, but little is known of his family after that date. Between 1784 and 1790, Hamilton attempted to receive compensation from the British government for the losses he sustained in the Revolution, eventually receiving ¬£13,630 along with his brother. In 1790, Hamilton was appointed the British consul at Norfolk, Virginia, one of only three former Loyalist military leaders to be given diplomatic posts in the United States. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Hamilton was recalled to England, where he died in 1816.

The car dominated Le Mans, winning each year from its 2006 introduction until it was replaced by the R15 in 2009. It was designed and constructed for sports car racing in the Le Mans Prototype LMP1 class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and other similar endurance races. The car was unveiled December 13, 2005 at 12:00 CET, and went on to win both its maiden race at the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring in March, and the June 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans. It was the first diesel to win either of those events. At $15 million a year it was the most ambitious and most expensive project ever undertaken by Audi Sport. As of 2019, Audi R10 TDI LMP1 car was the last-ever V12-engined race car to date. Chassis The Audi R10 TDI race car was built to supersede the Audi R8 racer, a proven model which had won five times at Le Mans since 2000 and earned a reputation as one of the most successful racing cars of all time. In later years the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO), which sets the rules for racing in the Le Mans 24 Hours, had reduced the restrictor size on the engine, and stipulated the R8 carry ballast, to make the races more competitive. In response to the new level of competition, the development of a successor was necessary. Though it does show a strong resemblance to the previous model, it is a new design. The aerodynamics package is in compliance with the new regulations. A second rollover hoop is added, and the wheelbase is lengthened to accept the new, longer V12 TDI TDI engine. The design and aerodynamics were developed by Audi, utilising the Fondtech wind tunnel. The monocoque is built by Audi 90% and Dallara 10%, as well with various suppliers manufacturing all the components and subassemblies. The cars are then assembled by Audi at Ingolstadt. =Weight= At the beginning of the 2006 season, homologation rules for Le Mans Prototypes (LMP) cars were changed, for the LMP1 class, an increase in minimum weight from 900 kg to 925 kg was mandated. While officially this was to allow closed top prototypes to run with air-conditioning (as this would have added weight over open top cars), some have speculated that this was done at the behest of Audi to allow the R10 to be competitive.Mulsanne's Corner News, 12.12.05, Michael J. Fuller The R10 TDI in the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring was overweight at , preventing engineers from using ballast to optimize handling and balance.Mulsanne's Corner News, 3.25.06, Michael J. Fuller Engine The R10's 5.5 litre V12 TDI diesel engine. Large grey mechanical components on the lower left are the diesel particulate filters developed with Audi by Dow Automotive. Unlike most racing cars competing in the LMP1 series, the R10 TDI is powered by a diesel engine, with two parallel turbochargers and utilizes the Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) technology. The engine block has a displacement of 5.5L in V12 configuration made of aluminium, employing common rail direct fuel injection technology. The turbochargers are supplied by Garrett AiResearch, with restrictor plates mounted in front of the intake. The V12 engine is rumored to weigh more than .2006 Audi R10, Michael J. Fuller, Mulsanne's Corner, 2006 This is heavier than the of a concurrent Judd V10, and even the of the Ricardo turbodiesel prototype based on it.Ricardo-Judd Diesel V10, Mulsanne's Corner, 2003 Audi engineers say that the weight per cylinder is the same as the preceding 3.6-litre FSI V8 of the Audi R8.Racing Toward Relevance , Christopher A. Sawyer, Automotive Design & Production, May 2006 The wheelbase has been increased over the R8 to to accommodate the longer engine. Even with a larger-than-necessary restrictor plate, the car is rumoured to produce in qualification, limited by the fuel combustion quality. This output cannot be maintained in races because it may cause a clogged diesel particulate filter. The peak pressure in the cylinder is probably around 200 bar, compared with 85 bar for an atmospheric petrol engine. =Diesels racing at Le Mans= Audi's decision to use a diesel engine emphasizes the commercial success of Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) turbodiesel engine (and its competitors) on Europe's roads. Diesels have been successfully used in other forms of racing as well, as their broad power band and fuel economy can prove advantageous, while in turn, the higher weight and lower rotational speed of the engine requiring new power transmissions are the disadvantages. The rules had to accommodate the need for a high capacity engine with a turbocharger and high boost, whereas both possibilities are no longer allowed for gasoline engines, as these had developed over in several race series of the past. It is not, however, the first diesel to be raced at Le Mans. The first diesel- engined car to qualify and race in the 24-hour event was a French entry in 1949, the first race held after the Second World War. The car was the Delettrez Diesel entered by brothers Jean and Jacques Delettrez, and was a 4395 cc 6-cylinder. It did not finish, running out of fuel about half way into the race. Delettrez entered again in 1950, as did another diesel car, the MAP. Again, both cars did not finish due to engine problems, a cooling system leak in the case of the MAP. The MAP was interesting in that it was the first mid- engined car to race at Le Mans; the engine was located immediately behind the driver, and was a four-cylinder opposed piston two-stroke with rocking levers connected to a single crank, similar to the later Commer TS3 engine. In 2004, a Lola equipped with a Caterpillar re-badged V10 TDI ran for a few hours before breaking its clutch. Peugeot competed with its new diesel effort in 2007 in its 908 HDi FAP race car. R10 results One of three Audi R10s at the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans =2006= On 18 March 2006, the #2 Audi R10 won the 54th annual 12 Hours of Sebring after earning pole position by setting a qualifying record. The #1 car did not finish due to an overheating problem. On the day after the Sebring victory an R10 flipped over during testing while running through Turn One. However the R10 would not complete the most of the season. The Audi R8, completed most of the season with the R10 returning to race in the different Le Mans Races (Le Mans 24 Hrs, Petit Le Mans etc.) On 18 June 2006, the #8 Audi R10 placed first at the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans, completing 380 laps, more than the R8 did, but less than the record set in 1971. The #7 Audi R10, which set fastest lap times in practice and race, came in third after suffering injector pump damage, completing 367 laps. Due to the sheer Audi dominance, the IMSA instantly made changes to the rules in the season. The Audi was not pegged back but competitors were helped to push their pace up to the Audi level. All LMP1 petrols were to be run at 860 kg and had their fuel tank increased to 95 liters. Dyson, Zytek, Creation and Porsche all have outqualified the Audi at one point during the season, but Audi were able to overcome the restriction deficit to take every win. On 30 September 2006, the #2 Audi R10 won the 9th annual Petit Le Mans endurance race at Road Atlanta in Georgia. The win was seventh in a row for Audi in Petit Le Mans, but first for the R10 model. The #1 car was not running at the finish due to late race collision with another car resulting in damaged front suspension. #1 car was still classified in seventh place overall. =2007= Audi R10, Le Mans 2007 On 17 March 2007, the #2 Audi R10 won the 55th annual 12 Hours of Sebring. The #1 car finished 2nd in its class (LMP1) and 4th overall.55th Annual Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring Final Race Results , IMSA, 03/17/07 The R10 remained undefeated in American Le Mans Series competition until April 14, 2007, at the Long Beach Grand Prix; where it finished seventh overall to the Porsche RS Spyders of Penske and Dyson Racing. The car still won the LMP1 class. IMSA had made changes to the category again. Under pressure from Audi and the ACO, LMP1 cars were now meant to have at least a 1.5% performance advantage over LMP2. The ACO reserves the right to make changes to specific cars if this was not happening. Throughout the season, the Penske Porsche RS Spyder won 8 overall victories against the Audi R10 which only won 4. The ALMS track nature suited the lighter and more nimble P2 cars more, which was evident as Audi loses time in the corners to the Porsche. At Petit Le Mans, Capello was able to use his speed advantage to overtake Dumas in the last half an hour. McNish and Capello won by 0.9 seconds. At Laguna Seca they won over the #7 Porsche by 0.4 seconds It is undefeated at the 24 hours of Le Mans, having successfully defended its 2006 victory. On June 17, 2007, the #1 R10 finished first overall, overcoming the loss of two of the three team cars and defeating a new challenge from the Peugeot 908 HDi FAP diesels. The #3 Audi was put out of the race by driver error, crashing into a wall, whereas the #2 car suffered a wheel failure at approximately and collided with a barrier. Video pictures showed the car being dropped prematurely during a prior pit stop with the wheel in question not being properly attached, but Audi's official statement is that the incident was not the fault of the pitcrew, as the car had been on track for over 50 minutes since its tires were last changed. At Le Mans it was obvious that the R10 was faster than the Peugeot 908 on the straights and much more stable in the corners. According to ACO's official data, the Audi R10 TDi reached a top speed of on the Mulsanne Straight in the 2006 race. In 2007, while changing their pace in order to beat Peugeot, the Audi R10 TDi hit on the Mulsanne Straight, which was faster than any other car in the race. The R10 TDi also set the best lap of the race at 3:27.176. The car seems to have managed a top speed of in practice at Le Mans in 2007, which would be the absolute speed record of an LMP car at Le Mans (since LMP's only run from the introduction of the two Mulsanne chicanes on). At the car's official launch in Paris, 2006, the Audi R10 TDi was presented as capable of reaching a top speed in the region of =2008= For the 2008 season, Audi entered the Le Mans Series for the first time. Joest Racing entered two cars to compete against Peugeot's two-car entry over the five race season. Peugeot led the championships early, winning the first three races prior to the 24 Hours of Le Mans. A new sub-wing was introduced at Spa. This maintains the same level of downforce but less drag. At Le Mans, Audi won for their third consecutive time with the R10. The #2 car driven by Rinaldo Capello, Allan McNish and Tom Kristensen took the chequered flag on lap 381 ahead of the #7 Peugeot, with a margin of just over 4 minutes. The other two Audi entries finished fourth and sixth overall. Peugeot brought their seasoned 908 HDi FAP and qualified within the 3:18 range while Audi struggled to get under the 3:23 mark. In the race itself the Peugeot was still up to 3.5 seconds a lap faster but quick pit work by Audi and the superior performance by the R10 in the rain saw Audi winning Le Mans. Returning to the Le Mans Series for the final two races of the year, Peugeot won once again at the N√ºrburgring and maintaining their lead in the championships. However, accidents for Peugeot and a win by the #1 Audi of Rinaldo Capello and Allan McNish at the Silverstone finale allowed the Audi team to win the Constructors Championship, while the #2 Audi of Mike Rockenfeller and Alexandre Pr√©mat earned the Drivers and Teams Championships. Audi also continued their participation in the American Le Mans Series. As in the year before, Audi fought against the Penske Racing Porsches for overall race wins, but unlike before they now had to contend with the multiple Acura teams. Porsche managed to end Audi's streak of seven straight victories at the 12 Hours of Sebring, but Audi rebounded with overall wins in the next two events. Three more overall victories were earned by Audi by time the series reached the Detroit Sports Car Challenge. Audi not only failed to win the race overall, but following a rule infraction, neither car finished in the LMP1 category. This was the first time that the Audi R10 failed to win in LMP1, and the first LMP1 loss by Audi since 2005. At Petit Le Mans, Allan McNish overtook Christian Klien in the Peugeot on the penultimate lap and held on to the win. =2009= Kolles' R10 TDI competing in its debut race, the 2009 1000 km of Catalunya In the 2009 season, the R10 TDI was replaced by the R15 TDI with a smaller, lighter, more-efficient TDI engine; however, Audi concentrated on the 24 Hours of Le Mans and Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM; German Touring Car Masters) efforts. The new car, however, ran in the 2009 12 Hours of Sebring before preparing for Le Mans. The Audi R10's wing was limited by the 2009 regulations. In early 2009, Colin Kolles announced that his team will run privately entered Audi R10 TDI's in that year's 24 Hours of Le Mans, and possibly the Le Mans Series. The deal included factory assistance for servicing the cars. At Le Mans, the Audi R10 best finished 7th overall, a few laps down on the highest petrol finisher Lola-Aston Martin which ranked 4th overall. =2010= Kolles fielded 2 Audi R10 in their final year at the Le Mans 24 Hours, on 14 June 2010. Unlike the factory Audi and Peugeot LMP1, the Kolles R10 was not hampered by the new restrictor regulations which should have shaved off 60 bhp from the diesel-powered prototypes. The cars qualified 3:30, just behind the two Lola Astons. Both cars failed to finish because too much strain from torque was put onto the gearbox.

The Chairman to the trust is Ary Shaeban. Located in the park is a bronze statue of Christopher Columbus sculpted by Count Vittorio di Colbertaldo of Verona, one of Benito Mussolini‚Äôs hand picked ceremonial bodyguards known as the ‚ÄúBlack Musketeers.‚Äù History Historic Aerial Photograph of Bayfront Park in 1940 The park began construction in 1924 under the design plans of Warren Henry Manning and officially opened in March 1925. Beginning in 1980, it underwent a major redesign by Japanese-American modernist artist and landscape architect, Isamu Noguchi. Today, Bayfront Park is maintained by the Bayfront Park Management Trust, a limited agency of the city of Miami, Florida. Bayfront Park is bordered on the north by Bayside Marketplace and the American Airlines Arena, on the south by Chopin Plaza, on the west by Biscayne Boulevard and on the east by Biscayne Bay. Bayfront Park is host to many large events such as the New Year's ball drop, Christmas celebrations, concerts, the Bayfront Park Amphitheater, the Tina Hills Pavilion, as well as boat tours around Biscayne Bay. Seven blocks north is Bayfront Park's partner park, the Bicentennial Park. This park‚Äôs name has been changed to Museum Park and it is home to The Perez Art Museum and the Frost Science Museum. In June 2020, the park's Ponce de Leon and Christopher Columbus statues were vandalized, though it was announced that they would not be removed.https://wsvn.com/news/local/columbus-statue-at-bayfront-vandalized- during-march-in-downtown-miami-to-protest-police-brutality/ =Site of assassination of Anton Cermak= On February 15, 1933, Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak was shot three times in the chest and mortally wounded while shaking hands with President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt in front of Bayfront Park by assassin Giuseppe Zangara. Along with Cermak, who died of his wounds 19 days later, four other people were hit by the gunman, one of whom also died. A serious debate has ensued as to whether Zangara had been actually trying to assassinate Roosevelt instead of Cermak, however no firm evidence has been found out to prove this theory. = Columbus Statue = A bronze statue of Christopher Columbus was placed in the park in 1952, donated by the city's Italian-American community. The statue itself was sculpted by Count Vittorio di Colbertaldo of Verona, one of Benito Mussolini‚Äôs hand picked ceremonial bodyguards known as the ‚ÄúBlack Musketeers.‚Äù Colbertaldo doubled as the Musketeers's sculptor, producing statutes which commemorated the organization. A second Columbus statue done by Colbertaldo is in Pioneer Park in San Francisco. On June 10th, 2020 the Columbus statue at Bayfront Park was spray- painted with red paint, symbolizing spilt blood, as an act of protest against the continued glorification of a man responsible for ushering in an era of exploitation and slaughter of Indigenous peoples by European colonizers. The action was carried out by individuals protesting the murder of George Floyd and police brutality. Events Bayfront Park holds the city's annual \\"America's Birthday Bash\\" on Independence Day, which attracted over 60,000 visitors in 2011. The park also hosts the city's official New Year's Eve party that annually hosts over 70,000 visitors. Visitors are encouraged to take public transport for events at Bayfront Park as parking can be scarce and expensive. The nearest Metrorail station is Government Center. From there a connection to the Metromover is available with three stops near the park, Bayfront Park, First Street, and College/Bayside. It has been the site of the Ultra Music Festival, an electronic dance music event. In 2018, Miami's commissioners barred the festival from being held downtown, citing complaints surrounding noise and the behavior of attendees, resulting in a relocation to Virginia Key. The festival will return to the park in March 2020. Notable people The large fountain on Biscayne Bay is a landmark in the park. *Caesar LaMonaca, was a composer and band leader for the City of Miami.

Champion Racing was a sports car racing team based in Pompano Beach, Florida, USA. Founded in 1994 by Dave Maraj, a former rally driver from Trinidad, as the motorsport wing of the Champion Motors car dealership, the team has campaigned various Porsches and Audis in North American road racing series. Champion Racing's extensive record includes a win at the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2005, and 5 straight American Le Mans Series LMP1 championships, 2 as a private team and 3 as a factory team under the name Audi Sport North America. Porsche years Champion entered their first race at the 1993 12 Hours of Sebring, finishing 21st overall and 7th in the Invitational GT class with a Porsche 911 Carrera 2 driven by Justin Bell, Mike Peters, and Oliver Kuttner. Mike Peters later stopped race driving and became team manager for the team. In 1994, they entered a 911 Turbo in several IMSA GT races, including the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring. For the 1995 season, Champion partnered with Michael Colucci Racing (MCR), and the team moved up to a 2 car team with a pair of 911 GT2. Champion running the #72 car (964 chassis) and MCR running the #74 car (993 chassis). After an accident put them out a Daytona, Hans- Joachim Stuck and Bill Adam finished 2nd in the GTS-1 class at Sebring. They also collected class podiums at Watkins Glen and Sears Point in the #74 car. In 1995 the team adopted the livery of a white background with various streaks of colours that has since become indelibly associated with the team. In fact, this livery was used on all Champion Racing entered cars, except for the special Stars & Stripes variation, using the blue and read colors of the American flag only, as tribute to the victims of the September 11 attacks. In 1996, Stuck and Adam won the GTS-1 class at Sebring with the #74, the first major win for Champion Racing. In 1997 Champion scaled back to a one car team, taking over the reins of the #74 Porsche with Stuck, Adam, and Thierry Boutsen finishing 2nd in class at the 1997 Daytona 24 Hours. For 1998, Champion Racing purchased a Porsche 911 GT1 Evo. The team ran a full season in the USRRC GT1 class, winning the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen and finishing on the podium in 3 other races, winning the makes (Porsche) and drivers (Boutsen) championships. The team also competed in three PSCR races; Boutsen, Bob Wollek, and Andy Pilgrim finished 2nd in GT1 and 3rd overall at the 12 Hours of Sebring, Boutsen and Wollek won the GT1 class at Road Atlanta in June (3rd overall), and Boutsen, Wollek and Ralf Kelleners won the GT1 class at the inaugural Petit Le Mans, finishing 3rd overall, earning an automatic entry to the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans. In 1999, Champion ran the GT1 in the new American Le Mans Series. Due to the regulations, however, they were forced to run in the Prototype class against theoretically faster cars. They scored their best result in the 12 Hours of Sebring, finishing 4th overall and in class. The team also raced a Porsche 911 GT3-R in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, finishing 2nd in the GT class. With no place to run the GT1 in 2000, Champion changed cars to a Lola B2K/10 with a Porsche engine. The team entered only two ALMS races (Sebring and Sears Point) and failed to finish either one. They also entered the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen, finishing 7th in class and 21st overall. The team spent most of the season developing the car, with the aim of a high finish at the 2001 24 Hours of Daytona. Daytona 2001 started well; the team qualified 6th. However, a loss of oil pressure seven and a half hours in caused the car to retire. The team came back to finish 2nd in the Daytona finale at the end of the season. The team finally found some success with the Lola at the 2002 24 Hours of Daytona, finishing 4th. After the race, the team would abandon the project, however Oliver Kuttner's Pegasus Racing would run the car in the latter half of the season. World Challenge GT with Audi In 2000, Champion partnered with Audi to develop and run the Audi S4 Competition in the SCCA Speedvision World Challenge series' GT class. For their first season, the pair of cars would be driven by reigning Touring Car champion Michael Galati and Le Mans winner Derek Bell. Bell finished 9th in the opening round at Charlotte. Galati would take 2nd in the championship, winning at Las Vegas and taking two other podiums. In 2001, Galati won the GT drivers' championship, taking 4 wins, and Audi won the manufacturers' championship by 1 point over Acura. In 2002, Galati would repeat as champion, with Bell 7th, and Audi 2nd in the manufacturers' standings. In 2003, Champion debuted the new Audi RS6 Competition. Randy Pobst finished on the podium at the first five races of the season, and won the last two rounds to take the Drivers' championship, and the manufacturers' championship for Audi. American Le Mans Series 2005 Petit Le Mans Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca Miller Motorsports Park =2001‚Äì05 (Audi R8)= In 2001, Champion Racing bought an Audi R8 for competition in the American Le Mans Series. The team finished 8 races of the 10 round season. The team claimed a third-place finish at both the 12 Hours of Sebring and Petit Le Mans as well as a second-place finish at the Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca round. The team finished 3rd in the LMP900 class championship.2001 ALMS Team Championship Results 2001 For 2002, the team continued to compete with their Audi R8 in the full American Le Mans Series season. Having claimed a second- place finish at both the 12 Hours of Sebring and Petit Le Mans the team finished the season 2nd in the LMP900 class championship, behind the factory Joest Audi team.2002 ALMS Team Championship Results 2002 2003 saw even more success for Champion Racing. After a second-place finish at the season opening 12 Hours of Sebring, the team went on to claim 4 overall victories including a win at Petit Le Mans. Champion Racing finished the season 2nd in the championship, only 7 points behind the factory Audi team.2003 ALMS Team Championship Results 2003 In 2004, all the teams hard work paid off. With the absence of the factory Audi and Panoz teams, Dyson Racing became the team's main rival. After a second-place finish at the season opening 12 Hours of Sebring, the team claimed 7 overall victories and claimed the LMP1 team and drivers championship.2004 ALMS Team Championship Results 20042004 ALMS Drivers Championship Results 2004 For 2005, the team campaigned the American Le Mans Series with its Audi R8 for the 5th straight year. Despite fierce competition from the Dyson Racing team, an overall victory at the 12 Hours of Sebring led to another 6 victories for the Champion Racing team. At the end of the season, the team claimed its second LMP1 team and drivers title.2005 ALMS Team Championship Results 20052005 ALMS Drivers Championship Results 2005 =2006‚Äì08 (Audi R10)= In 2006, Champion Racing earned full-factory support from Audi and took over the Audi Sport North America title from Joest Racing. The team started the season with an overall victory at the 12 Hours of Sebring with the brand new Audi R10 TDI. With the new car needing more testing and development, the team returned to the Audi R8 for 3 races. The R10 returned to competition at Lime Rock Park. The team claim overall victories at 9 of the 10 races comfortably giving the team the LMP1 team and drivers championship titles.2006 ALMS Team Championship Results 20062006 ALMS Drivers Championship Results 2006 2007 saw the Porsche and Acura LMP2 cars become the team's biggest challenge. Rule changes by the ACO made LMP2 cars the ability to compete for overall victories, particularly at the smaller, tighter tracks on the ALMS schedule. Despite claiming 12 straight class victories, the Penske Racing Porsche RS Spyders were able to beat the Audi R10s 8 times for overall victory. By the end of the season, the team claimed the LMP1 team and drivers championship titles.2007 ALMS Team Championship Results 20072007 ALMS Drivers Championship Results 2007 In 2008, Champion Racing fought back against the competition of the LMP2 cars. Despite losing out on a victory at the 12 Hours of Sebring, the team claimed 10 class victories as well as 7 overall victories in the 11 race season. At the end of the season, Champion Racing claimed their 5th straight LMP1 team and drivers championship title.2008 ALMS Team Championship Results 20082008 ALMS Drivers Championship Results 2008 At the end of the 2008 season, Audi announced its withdrawal from the American Le Mans Series, citing economic pressures. While Audi would continue to compete in select ALMS events, it would contest them with Joest Racing, bringing to an end Champion Racing's motorsport activities.

The team was based in Dublin, Ohio. They previously operated two Oreca FLM09 sports cars in the American Le Mans Series. At current, the company has transitioned into diet supplements.  History  = Beginnings = The team was founded in 1998 by IMSA GT Championship driver Jon Field. Pickett bought a Riley & Scott Mk III and raced it in the WSC class. Car number 28 made its d√©but at the 1998 12 Hours of Sebring with Field joined by Butch Brickell and Rick Sutherland but retired after 173 laps. The team finished fourth in the WSC standings. 1999 saw the birth of the American Le Mans Series. Intersport entered the 1999 season with a brand new Ford powered Lola B98/10 chassis, although Intersport did use a Riley & Scott Mk III for some events. The team raced in the LMP class for the season and team principal Jon Field recruited Ryan Jones and Chris Goodwin for the first round of the season at Sebring. The car finished 19th overall and eleventh in class. The team did not score any podiums afterwards and did get some points finishes. Intersport finished ninth in the teams championship. 2000 saw Intersport remain in the top LMP class in ALMS with a brand new Lola B2K/10 chassis to be raced in every round with the exception of the Sebring round where the team would race the B98/10 of the previous year. Intersport also raced in the Grand-Am Road Racing Championship with the same cars as raced in ALMS. Field drove mainly in 2000 with Oliver Gavin and Rick Sutherland. They did pick up an impressive second-place finish at the Watkins Glen 6 Hours. Intersport finished seventh in the Grand-Am teams championship, whilst finishing sixth in the ALMS. = 2001 = 2001 saw Intersport earning success, particularly in Grand-Am where Intersport won two events in the season in the top SRP class, winning at Mid-Ohio and Phoenix in the Lola B2K/10-Judd. Oliver Gavin was once again Jon Field's team mate for the season. For ALMS duties, Jon gave his son Clint Field an opportunity to race alongside his father. Jon switched between Clint and Rick Sutherland throughout the season. Racing the same Lola-Judd in Grand-Am, the car did finish in the points but did not pick up any wins or podiums due to tough competition from Audi Sport who race in the LMP900 class with Intersport. The team finished sixth in the teams championship out of eight teams. Intersport did well in Grand-Am, finishing fourth in the teams championship and Jon Field, fourth in the drivers. = 2002 - ALMS Success = For 2002, Intersport left Grand-Am and focused on ALMS. The dropped down to LMP675, the lowest Le Mans Prototype class, purchasing an MG-Lola EX257. Duncan Dayton, Michael Durand and Clint Field were his team mates during certain events over the season. LMP675 cars at first tended to be quite unreliable but at the 12 Hours of Sebring, the Intersport Lola did very well, finishing seventh overall and by far the winning LMP675 car. The next nearest LMP675 finisher finished 25th overall, 62 laps behind. Intersport picked up two more victories after Sebring, the first at the Grand Prix of Washington D.C. and at Petit Le Mans. It was evident that the car is more suited for endurance racing rather than three hour \\"sprint\\" races. Intersport finished second in the teams championship, losing out by a point to KnightHawk Racing who used almost the same AER-powered MG-Lola car as Intersport. In the drivers championship, Jon Field took that crown, 15 points ahead of second place Ben Devlin of Archangel Motorsports. = 2003 - 2004 = 2003 saw little change in the Intersport camp as they stuck with the championship winning MG-Lola of 2002. They did also enter a car in the LMP900 class, racing a Judd-powered Lola B2K/10 chassis for the first half of the season then switching to a Riley & Scott Mk III C with an √âlan engine. The first round at Sebring was a mixed reaction in the team with the LMP675 car finishing second in class in the hands of Jon Field, Dayton and Durand but the LMP900 car of Clint Field, Sutherland and John Macaluso retired but was disqualified anyway for receiving outside assistance while still on the race course. Round two at Road Atlanta saw the LMP675 MG- Lola win in class, narrowly ahead of the similar MG-Lola EX257 of Dyson Racing Team. Intersport also finished third place overall. Intersport took another class victory at the Grand Prix de Trois-Rivi√®res, finishing narrowly ahead of the LMP900 class car. In October, the team returned to Road Atlanta for the Petit Le Mans which saw the MG-Lola replaced with an all new Lola B01/60. The AER two litre turbo powerplant was replaced by a naturally aspirated 3.4 litre Judd V8. It was successful, with Dayton, Jon Field and Larry Connor winning in the LMP675 class. Intersport finished second in the LMP675 teams championship and fifth in LMP900. 2003 was the teams d√©but at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. They used the MG-Lola that was used during most of the ALMS season. They qualified second fastest in the LMP675 class behind RN Motorsports Ltd. sadly, the car retired with engine problems after 107 laps. The 2004 American Le Mans Series season was quite similar to 2003. They used two cars throughout the season, a Lola B01/60 and Riley & Scott Mk III C in the LMP1 class and a Lola B2K/40 in the LMP2 class. It was LMP2 that was most successful for Intersport. They won six of the nine events, however the races they did not win, they did not finish at all which cost them the teams championship in the end, losing out to Miracle Motorsports. LMP1 saw very little success for Intersport, apart from second place at the Road America 500. They finished fourth in the LMP1 teams championship. The two LMP1 and LMP2 cars ran at that year's Le Mans 24 Hours. The LMP1 car was driven by Jon Field, Duncan Dayton and Larry Connor and the LMP2 car was driven by Clint Field, Rick Sutherland and William Binnie. The LMP1 car took an early exit, crashing out after 29 laps but the LMP2 car was successful, winning in class, although it was second last overall of the classified finishers. = 2005 - Driver and Team Glory = 2005 saw Telesis Intersport Racing ran two LMP2 cars at the 12 Hours of Sebring before opting to race one car for the full season. Car No. 30 was a Lola B2K/40-Judd that was to be used just for Sebring and car 37 was a brand new Lola B05/40-AER which would be used for the full season. Both cars retired at Sebring before father and son, Jon and Clint won the next round in the LMP2 class at Road Atlanta. Jon only raced some events in 2005 to let Clint attempt to repeat Jon's 2002 LMP2 winning ways, with help from various team mates such as Liz Halliday and Gregor Fisken. They won four rounds after Road Atlanta, their most impressive win was on their return to Road Atlanta at the Petit Le Mans. 2005 is considered to be Intersport's most successful year. They won the teams championship in LMP2 with 133 points, 16 points ahead of Miracle Motorsports. Clint Field won the LMP2 drivers championship, racing every race for Intersport in 2005, with Jon finishing in fifth. = 2006 = Intersport Lola B05/40 lapping GT cars at the 2006 Petit Le Mans. 2006 was a tough year for Intersport with the arrival of Penske Racing and the Porsche RS Spyder. The Porsche was very fast and reliable winning overall in some races over LMP1 cars. Clint Field and Liz Halliday were the full season drivers with appearances from Jon Field and Duncan Dayton. The Intersport Lola-AER was very quick at Sebring winning in LMP2 class and finishing second overall, four laps behind Audi's new diesel R10. They won the following round in Texas after mechanical problems for the leading Penske Porsche forced it to retire. Penske got the car sorted out and started winning in LMP2. Intersport won just one race after the Texas round which was at Portland after the leading Porsche retired due to a battery falling off the car from earlier contact between Highcroft Racing and part-time Intersport driver Duncan Dayton. Intersport finished second in LMP2 teams championship 34 points behind Penske and an impressive 99 points ahead of third place B-K Motorsports. Interpsport returned to Le Mans in 2006 with Clint Field, Halliday and Dayton piloting the Lola-AER. Intersport finished 19th overall and fourth in LMP2 class. = 2007-2008 = Intersport's new Creation CA06/H at the 2007 Utah Grand Prix. 2007 saw Intersport return to LMP1 with a brand new Creation CA06/H chassis, powered by a five-litre Judd V10. Unfortunately, Audi Sport North America dominated the LMP1 class with their diesel R10, winning every race in LMP1 class. Their best class finish was second at the Northeast Grand Prix with Jon and Clint joined by Richard Berry. After seven consecutive points finishes, the seventh round at Mid-Ohio was the final race in which Intersport scored points. For Petit Le Mans, Intersport purchased the ex-Dyson Racing Lola B06/10-AER but this did not help their points drought, retiring at Road Atlanta and in Laguna Seca. The 2008 season saw Intersport race the Lola they debuted at Petit Le Mans in 2007. There was very little competition in LMP1, with no other team racing a full season with the exception of the dominant Audi team and Autocon Motorsports. Intersport did get a win which was at Detroit when the initial LMP1 winner, the No. 1 Audi failed post-race inspection as the car was under the minimum weight requirement for its class (900 kg). Jon, Clint and Richard Berry won in LMP1 from 22nd overall. Due to Intersport being the only other decent full season entry apart from Audi, they comfortably finished second in the teams championship in LMP1. = 2009-2010 = Intersport Lola B06/10 at the 2010 Northeast Grand Prix. 2009 saw Acura replace Audi as the dominant LMP1 force as Audi did not enter a full ALMS season, only racing at the long events such as Sebring and Petit Le Mans. Intersport used the same Lola-AER as before. Their best finish was second place at St. Pete. The team finished third in the LMP1 teams championship behind the Acura teams of Highcroft Racing and de Ferran Motorsports. 2010 was another unsuccessful season for Intersport with LMP1 and LMP2 merging to form a single LMP class. Intersport used the same Lola-AER that has been plagued with reliability problems but the four litre twin-turbo V8 has shown glimpses of its pace with the car leading overall for a brief period at Laguna Seca before retiring with a turbo problem. The two LMP classes split at the Sebring and Petit Le Mans rounds. At the 2010 Petit Le Mans, Intersport was the surprise package as the mechanically troubled Lola-AER completed the race in fifth overall and fourth in LMP1 class but scored the maximum 30 points as it was the highest placed full season LMP1 entry. The 2010 season saw interesting new changes in classes. One of those was the new Le Mans Prototype Challenge (LMPC) class which was introduced. It was a spec class using the same cars used in Formula Le Mans. Intersport bought one of these Oreca FLM09 cars and ran a full season with many different drivers. Intersport finished fourth in the championship. = 2011 = Kyle Marcelli driving the #89 Oreca FLM09 at the 2011 Petit Le Mans. For the 2011 American Le Mans Series season, Intersport left the B06/10 and used two Oreca FLM09 LMPC cars. The team finished third in the Teams' Championship out of five teams. They won two of the nine rounds during the season, the first being at Mid-Ohio where Kyle Marcelli and Tomy Drissi drove the #37 car across the chequered flag. The same duo won Intersports second and only win in 2011 at the Baltimore Grand Prix although in the #89 car this time round. There were many different driver combinations used by the team throughout the season. Of the ten drivers that competed for Intersport throughout the season, Kyle Marcelli was the highest placed driver in the Drivers' Championship finishing in third place.

The band was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, both of whom left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo is best known for the singles \\"Stressed Out\\", \\"Ride\\", and \\"Heathens\\". The group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for \\"Stressed Out\\". The band independently released two albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by record label Fueled by Ramen in 2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013. The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album, Blurryface (2015), which produced the successful singles \\"Stressed Out\\" and \\"Ride\\" and became the first album in history on which every track received at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The release of the single \\"Heathens\\" also made the group the first alternative artist to have two concurrent top ten singles in the United States. The duo's fifth studio album, Trench, was released on October 5, 2018.  History  = 2009‚Äì2011: Formation and self-titled album = Tyler Joseph first met future bandmate Nick Thomas at a young age while playing youth basketball in Columbus, Ohio. Thomas later transferred to Joseph's middle school, and the two would remain friends through high school. Joseph began playing music after finding an old keyboard in his closet, a Christmas gift from his mother, and started mimicking radio melodies. In 2007, Joseph recorded a solo album, No Phun Intended, in his parent's basement. Thomas contributed guitar to several songs on the album, and collaborated on the track \\"Trees\\", which would later become a signature Twenty One Pilots song. While attending Ohio State University, Joseph met Texas-born future bandmate Chris Salih at a party. Noting the songwriter's talent and creative energy, Salih consulted Joseph about starting a band. Impressed by the recording studio Salih had built in his house, Joseph agreed to play music together and began sharing his ideas for new music. Just before their first performance, Joseph invited Thomas to join the unnamed band as a bassist. In 2009, the group moved into a house of their own, where their first album was conceptualized and recorded in the basement. The band initially played for a wide variety of audiences at clubs and venues around the Columbus area. Playing at metal, hardcore, and electronic venues influenced Joseph to incorporate these disparate styles with his songwriting. To catch the attention of unfamiliar or disinterested attendees and promoters, the band began to experiment with costumes and on-stage acrobatics. Now going by the name Twenty One Pilots, the group released their debut, self-titled album, Twenty One Pilots, on December 29, 2009, and began touring Ohio. Their initial marketing was grassroots; Joseph's mother would stand outside of Ohio State University giving away tickets to his shows. During this time, the band participated in \\"Battle of the Band\\" contests at The Alrosa Villa and The Basement, important Columbus music venues. In 2010, the band posted two tracks to their SoundCloud account, a cover of \\"Jar of Hearts\\" by Christina Perri and a remixed interpretation of \\"Con te partir√≤ (Time to Say Goodbye)\\" by Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman. The latter track would become the first song local drummer Josh Dun heard from the group. Joseph, Dun, and Salih participated in musical efforts of a Columbus, Ohio, church Five14. They contributed to four of fourteen tracks for their album Clear, with Travis Whittaker and the gospel band \\"New Albany Music.\\" In 2011, Joseph appeared in a three-part video called \\"The (moderately inspiring tale of the) Longboard Rodeo Tango\\", and sang \\"O come, O come, Emmanuel\\" in another video, Christmas With the Stars. = 2011‚Äì2012: Lineup changes and Regional at Best = Salih left on May 8, 2011 to focus on work, and Thomas left the next month on June 3, 2011 to focus on schooling, both posting farewell notes on the band's official Facebook page. Before departing the project, Salih invited Guitar Center co-worker and friend of the group Josh Dun (former touring drummer for House of Heroes), to take his place in the band. Impressed by the band's potential and Joseph's creative vision, Dun abandoned plans to pursue drumming in Nashville and joined the project only a few weeks before Thomas left the group. Both Salih and Thomas remained involved with the band's production for some time after their departure. Thomas briefly attended school in North Carolina, but moved back into Joseph and Dun's house in Columbus a year later and began to manage their merchandise. Thomas remained a part of the merchandise distribution crew throughout the production of Blurryface and continues to stay actively involved in the band's tour cycle. Twenty One Pilots performing in 2012 With a new lineup consisting of only Joseph and Dun, Twenty One Pilots self-released their second album, Regional at Best, on July 8, 2011. The album was accompanied by a free CD release show on the grounds of New Albany High School. While Salih and Thomas were involved with the conceptualization of the album, neither they nor Dun claim to have had much involvement with its production, which was handled nearly exclusively by Joseph. The album features Joseph's brother Zack on the track \\"Kitchen Sink\\" and Joseph's college acquaintance Jocef on the track \\"Be Concerned\\". In November 2011, after months of cultivating a fan base in the Columbus area via social media interaction and constant touring, the band played a sold-out concert at Columbus' Newport Music Hall. This notable accomplishment for an unsigned local group caught the attention of several record labels interested in seeing if the band's appeal could stretch outside of Ohio. That same year, the duo put out two free songs via their email newsletter: the original version of \\"House of Gold\\" and \\"Two\\". Joseph and Dun embarked on the Regional at Best Tour with rock band CHALLENGER!, documenting it in a series of videos uploaded to the Twenty One Pilots YouTube channel. = 2012‚Äì2014: Major label signing and Vessel = In April 2012, the band announced their signing to Atlantic Records subsidiary Fueled by Ramen, the label responsible for the commercial success of popular alternative artists like Panic! at the Disco and Paramore, during a sold-out show at the Lifestyle Communities Pavilion. On July 17, 2012, they released their debut Fueled by Ramen recording, an EP entitled Three Songs. The next month, the band embarked on a short tour with Neon Trees and Walk the Moon. Tyler Joseph successfully negotiated to maintain ownership of the preceding self-titled album, which remains available digitally. However, as part of a signing agreement in 2012 with record label Fueled by Ramen, rights to Regional at Best were transferred to the label, meaning that Regional at Best was discontinued and removed from digital markets. Regional at Best tracks \\"Slowtown\\", \\"Anathema\\", \\"Ruby\\", \\"Be Concerned\\", and \\"Clear\\" have since been made commercially unavailable, and physical copies of the album are now rare and highly sought after. On November 12, 2012, the official music video for \\"Holding on to You\\", directed by Jordan Bahat, was released on YouTube. On January 7 and April 19, 2013, the band released music videos for \\"Guns for Hands\\" and \\"Car Radio\\", respectively, both directed by Mark Eshleman of Reel Bear Media. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Joseph described Regional at Best as a \\"glorified mixtape\\" and confirmed that songs from that project would reappear on their major label debut studio album. Ultimately, five tracks from Regional at Best ‚Äì \\"Guns for Hands\\", \\"Holding on to You\\", \\"Ode to Sleep\\", \\"Car Radio\\", and \\"Trees\\" ‚Äì were re-recorded and released for their third album. \\"Lovely\\" was also re-recorded and released as a single in Japan on April 17, 2013. \\"Glowing Eyes\\", \\"Kitchen Sink\\", and \\"Forest\\" appeared unchanged as bonus tracks on the UK version of Vessel. Twenty One Pilots' third album, Vessel, was released January 8, 2013; it would reach No. 21 on the Billboard 200, No. 9 on the Digital Albums chart, No. 17 on the Internet Albums chart, No. 15 on the Rock Albums Chart, and No. 10 on the Alternative Albums Chart. The band's first charting single, \\"Holding on to You\\", reached No. 11 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. Additionally, the singles \\"Guns for Hands\\" and \\"Lovely\\" reached No. 21 and No. 67, respectively, on the Japan Hot 100. In May 2013, Twenty One Pilots were announced to join Fall Out Boy as opening acts on their Save Rock and Roll Arena Tour, along with Panic! at the Disco, also serving as opening acts. Frontman Tyler Joseph performing in 2014 On August 8, 2013, Twenty One Pilots performed \\"House of Gold\\" on Conan in their late night debut. On October 2, the music video for the song was uploaded onto YouTube. Twenty One Pilots performing live in 2014 for \\"Boston Calling: Day Three\\" On March 17, 2014, Twenty One Pilots performed a set at the MTVU Woodie Awards during SXSW. On April 13, Twenty One Pilots performed \\"Car Radio\\" at the 2014 MTV Movie Awards. On April 28, the band performed \\"Car Radio\\" on Late Night with Seth Meyers. In 2014, Twenty One Pilots played a number of music festivals and other events around the United States, such as Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, Boston Calling, and Firefly. Requests from many of these cities were incorporated into the band's first headlining tour, the Quiet Is Violent World Tour, which began in September 2014 and ended in November of the same year. On December 31, 2014, the band released a music video for the song \\"Ode to Sleep\\". Composed of footage captured by band creative director Mark Eshleman from three concerts over the preceding three years, the video depicted the band's rapid growth from their origins as a small local band to a nationally popular alternative act, an upward trend that would continue into the next album cycle. = 2015‚Äì2017: Blurryface = On March 16, 2015, the band announced that a new album, Blurryface, was to be released on May 19. They released the first single, \\"Fairly Local\\", on March 17. Their second single of the album, \\"Tear in My Heart\\", and its music video were released on April 5, 2015.twenty one pilots: Tear In My Heart ; YouTube, April 6, 2015 On April 28, \\"Stressed Out\\", the third single from the album, was released along with a music video.Stressed Out; Google Play Store, April 28, 2015twenty one pilots: Stressed Out ; YouTube, April 28, 2015 \\"Stressed Out\\" became the group's highest selling single, peaking at No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and No. 1 on both Alternative Songs and Hot Rock Songs charts, while also surpassing one billion views on YouTube. Blurryface was released two days early on May 17, 2015 and sold 134,000 copies in the first week in the U.S. which made it the band's first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. On May 22, 2016, Blurryface won in the category of \\"Top Rock Album\\" at the Billboard Music Awards, while the band won the category of \\"Top Rock Artist\\". Twenty One Pilots performing at Shepherds Bush Empire in late 2015 The band began the Blurryface Tour on May 11, 2015, in Glasgow, Scotland. The tour spanned the United States, Australia, Asia, and Europe. The U.S. leg began September 8, 2015 and featured Echosmith and Finish Ticket as openers. Twenty One Pilots performed \\"Stressed Out\\" on Late Night with Seth Meyers on September 14, 2015. The band announced a London show in February 2016, and later announced a run of UK dates, with a second London date added. The band Transviolet served as openers. This run of UK dates ended the initial Blurryface Tour. Soon after, the band announced a second tour for the Blurryface album, the Emotional Roadshow World Tour, which started in Cincinnati on May 31, 2016. The tour covered the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, and Australia. Chef'Special and Mutemath opened for the American leg. Irish singer Bry joined the tour for its European leg. On June 16, 2016, the band released the song \\"Heathens\\" as the first single from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, earlier than the expected release date of June 24, after the song leaked onto the internet on June 15. A music video for the song was released on June 21, 2016. \\"Heathens\\" plays during the ending credits of the film. Twenty One Pilots became the third rock act to have two singles simultaneously chart in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100, joining the Beatles and Elvis Presley, in addition to becoming the third duo to accomplish this feat, after Outkast in 2003 and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis ten years later. Twenty One Pilots performing in London in 2016 In September 2016, the band contributed a cover of the piano ballad \\"Cancer\\" by My Chemical Romance to the tribute album Rock Sound Presents: The Black Parade. An animated lyric video followed the release of the song. Twenty One Pilots featured as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on October 8, 2016, performing orchestra-accompanied versions of \\"Heathens\\" and \\"Ride\\" in what Rolling Stone called their \\"most high profile performance yet\\". The band later performed a medley of \\"Heathens\\" and \\"Stressed Out\\" on the American Music Awards of 2016, where they also accepted their first awards on American television for Favorite Pop/Rock Duo and Favorite Alternative Rock Artist. On November 25, 2016, the band released a limited-edition live vinyl album documenting two performances at Fox Oakland Theatre, on the duo's 2015 Blurryface Tour under the name Blurryface Live. Twenty One Pilots performing in London in 2016 Joseph and Dun collaborated with alternative rock band Mutemath, for a five-song EP, TOPxMM, composed of remixes and re-imaginings of four tracks from Blurryface and Heathens. The EP was uploaded onto the band's official website free of charge on December 19; a 25-minute long video of the bands recording the songs live in studio was also released on the band's YouTube channel. On February 12, 2017, Twenty One Pilots won a Grammy Award for \\"Stressed Out\\" in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category. The band stripped to their underwear before taking the stage, with Joseph claiming in their acceptance speech that this was a fulfillment of a promise the duo had made each other in their early days as a local Columbus band. On March 27, 2017, the band began selling tickets for Tour De Columbus, a five-date hometown tour taking place in June 2017. The duo performed at several small venues they first played as a local band including The Basement, Newport Music Hall, and Express Live!, before ending their tour cycle with arena shows at Nationwide Arena and Value City Arena. In an interview with Alternative Press in November 2016, Twenty One Pilots stated that after their last show, they will be \\"going dark\\" to focus on new music. Joseph stated that he would like to focus on lyrical content of the music, and bring the music back to the \\"authenticity, lyrics, delivery, and fearlessness of songwriting\\" similar to that of the self-titled album. The band's last activity came in July 2017 in the form of posts on social media depicting an eye closing over lyrics from several of their songs. In March 2018, their song \\"Hometown\\" received a gold certification from the RIAA, making Blurryface the first full-length album to have every track achieve at least gold certification.https://www.riaa.com/wp- content/uploads/2018/04/GP_March_2018.pdf Retrieved April 22, 2018. = 2018‚Äìpresent: Trench = In April 2018, a cryptic message was uncovered on the band's web store, which revealed a website. Fans began using clues and found other sections of this site, hinting at the possibility of the band's return. There were multiple images uploaded to the website, including letters from a character named \\"Clancy\\". In July 2018, Twenty One Pilots broke their year- long silence, first sending a cryptic email to fans and later posting a video to all social media platforms and updating their logo and branding. Tyler Joseph made his first media appearance in over a year for an interview with Zane Lowe of Beats 1 from his home studio in Columbus, Ohio, in which he spoke about the band's year long hiatus, creating the new album, and battling against personal demons and insecurities. On July 11, 2018, the band released two new songs, \\"Jumpsuit\\" and \\"Nico and the Niners\\", as well as the music video for \\"Jumpsuit\\". They also made the announcement of their fifth studio album, Trench, scheduled to be released on October 5, 2018, and a new world tour, titled \\"The Bandito Tour\\", starting October 16. Later, on July 26, 2018, the music video for \\"Nico and the Niners\\" was released. The song \\"Levitate\\" was subsequently released as the album's third single via Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show as the day's \\"World Record\\". The music video was also released, concluding the trilogy series. On August 20, 2018, at the MTV VMAs, a ten second long snippet of the song \\"My Blood\\" was played at the end of a commercial promoting the album. On August 27, 2018, the band made \\"My Blood\\" available on streaming services as the album's fourth official single. Twenty One Pilots released their fifth album, Trench, on October 5, 2018. On the same day, they released the music video for their single \\"My Blood\\" on their YouTube channel. Trench debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Rock Albums and Alternative Albums charts. All 14 tracks from the album charted in the top 25 of the Hot Rock Songs chart, where five tracks were in the top 10. On September 12, 2018, Twenty One Pilots played their first live show in over a year, titled A Complete Diversion, at O2 Brixton Academy in London. They performed the four released songs from Trench, as well as some songs from their previous albums, to promote the album and the upcoming The Bandito Tour. Twenty One Pilots performed their single \\"Jumpsuit\\" at the 2018 American Music Awards on October 9, at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles. On November 1, the band performed stripped down versions of \\"My Blood\\" and \\"Ride\\", as well as covered Damien Rice's \\"9 Crimes\\", in BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. BBC Radio 1 visited the band in their hometown and filmed the session at the Newport Music Hall in Columbus, Ohio, for the kickoff of the Live Lounge Month, a month-long series of performances from different artists. On October 16, the band embarked on the worldwide The Bandito Tour, starting in the United States and continuing with legs in Oceania and Europe. They also announced additional 2019 tour dates for shows in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Gab Ginsberg of Billboard described The Bandito Tour as a \\"must-see performance,\\" noting the band's stunts during the set which included leaping, backflipping, vertical crowd-surfing, suspended bridge walking, and scaffolding scaling. On January 22, 2019, the music video for \\"Chlorine\\" was uploaded to YouTube upon the song's release as a single and was directed by Mark C. Eshleman of Reel Bear Media, featuring an alien-like creature named \\"Ned\\". The band headlined a number of festivals in the summer of 2019, including Reading and Leeds and Lollapalooza. On March 4, 2019, the band revealed to NME that they were already starting the writing process for their sixth studio album, mentioning a character that has not appeared in any Twenty One Pilots-related material yet. On June 19, 2019, a re-imagined version of \\"Chlorine\\", titled \\"Chlorine (19.4326¬∞ N, 99.1332¬∞ W)\\", was released. It is the first song to be released from the L√∏cati√∏n Sessi√∏ns. Other songs in the series will include \\"Ride\\", \\"Smithereens\\", \\"My Blood\\" and \\"Cut My Lip\\". In 2019, Nationwide Boulevard in Columbus, Ohio was temporarily renamed to Twenty One Pilots Boulevard to celebrate two hometown shows at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, where the band also opened up a pop-up shop named \\"Ned's Bayou\\". On July 16, 2019, the song \\"The Hype\\" was sent to US alternative radio as the sixth single from the album Trench. On April 9, 2020, the band released a new single \\"Level of Concern\\". The song's lyrics reference the anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its accompanying music video was filmed in Joseph and Dun's homes while they were under lockdown due to the pandemic. Joseph directed a portion of the song's proceeds to Crew Nation, a charity for live music crews who cannot be paid during the international quarantine.  Artistry  The duo grew up in strict Christian households where they had to either conceal their pop punk and hip hop albums from the censure of their parents, or find faith- friendly counterparts. Both still identify as Christians, although doubting ones. According to Dun, \\"I'd hide albums like Green Day‚Äôs Dookie under my bed. They'd find a Christian alternative, like Relient K, and make me listen to that.\\" However, his parents eventually relaxed on rock music, even allowing Dun to assemble a live drum kit in their basement. Joseph's very first favorite band was the Christian rap rock trio DC Talk. He taught himself the piano by playing along to songs on the radio by artists like the Beatles and Celine Dion. =Musical style= The band's musical style has been described as alternative hip hop, electropop, indie pop, pop rock, rap rock, alternative rock, rock, synth-pop, pop, electronica, electronic rock, indie rock, hip hop, and indietronica with reggae, folk, psychedelic, new wave and funk influences. Because their music is highly versatile and contains a mix of many genres, the duo has been difficult to categorize. Dun admits it's hard to place themselves in a certain genre. He claims the band's manager calls them \\"pop-rock-piano- rap\\", which he says is fitting but is a mouthful. Joseph and Dun attribute this style to their background as independent and self-taught musicians who played the music they enjoyed. In response to criticism of their style as trying to be \\"all things to everyone\\", Joseph responded, \\"I'm not trying to be that. I'm being what I want to be for myself.\\" Dun elaborates one of their goals as musicians was to tear down the walls of musical genres and combine different aspects into their own. Sharing similar sentiments, Joseph said as a songwriter that he wouldn't want to listen to music and anticipate what will happen next, saying that it doesn't sound interesting to him. He prefers to catch listeners off guard before the song's end. The duo are best defined as alternative hip hop, a subgenre of hip hop known for its unconventional nature and blending of music styles that is embraced primarily by alternative rock listeners and college radio moreso than rap or pop audiences. They create music borrowing from a wide variety of different genres, most often hip hop, electropop, punk, rock, and reggae. Their songs contain a mixture of musical styles, intertwining rap rock rhymes laced with hard rock energy and piano pop hooks over synth-pop beats and reggae rhythms. Early material is post-emo, following down the lane of bands like My Chemical Romance and Dashboard Confessional with show tune or glam soundscapes. At the time of their major- label debut album Vessel, Twenty One Pilots was described as an indie rock duo. The album featured a fusion of rap, piano pop, rock and electronica. Their breakthrough album Blurryface expressed elements of pop, EDM, breakbeat, reggae, and dancehall. As the duo progressed, hip hop has become an increasingly more prominent musical influence. Twenty One Pilots has since become hailed as a leading contemporary alternative rock group, having sent three singles to the summit of the hot rock charts. Twenty One Pilots initially began with conventional live instrumentation, but they found success as part of a group that creates music on laptops. Both musicians are accomplished multi-instrumentalists. The duo achieve their sound through singer Tyler Joseph being a pianist, bassist and keyboardist and drummer Josh Dun playing a live drum kit. Other instrumentation used in songs include synthesizers, piano, electronic keyboards, and occasionally ukulele. Their tracks most prominently integrate programmed beats and keyboards, along with Dun playing drums. This mixture provides the duo with a rock and electropop crossover sound. Despite their chart-topping dominance of rock charts, many of their songs feature no guitar. For their songs, software replace traditional rock instruments and loops take precedent over riffs. Some listeners question whether Twenty One Pilots constitute as rock, considering that the duo neglect the use of electric guitar. According to University of Virginia musicologist Karl Hagstrom Miller, Twenty One Pilots is a prime example of how modern bands are evolving from the guitar-bass-drums format, a staple of punk rock, to \\"other configurations of musical collaboration.\\" During their songs, Joseph incorporates rapping, singing, and sometimes crooning. He utilizes a fast- paced style of reciting poetic lyrics that is characteristic of rap music. His rapping voice has a strong emphasis on flow and rhyme schemes, and been likened to that of hip-hop artists K'naan and Macklemore. While he acknowledges Joseph's style of rapping is often compared to Macklemore, music journalist Carl Wilson opines, \\"but among the ranks of post-Eminem white rappers, I find Joseph more probing, sardonic, and expressive.\\" However, Joseph doesn't consider himself a rapper. Joseph explains that he never intended to be a rapper, and simply finds the art form of rap the most effective way of trying to say something with his music. He realized how little the amount of lyrics are in a full song, because they're sung and words are drawn out by melodies. When attempting to write poetry he had written for the lyrics of a song, Joseph found there were way too many words to fit. He soon found himself just saying the poetry in tempo and realizing that he was rapping. His vocal performance, which sometimes also includes full-throated screaming lines, coupled with an earnest, patchy way of delivering word play atop Dun's drum rhythms is part of what allowed the duo to break out of the alternative scene. =Lyrical themes= Tyler Joseph writes lyrics that are psychodramatic in nature and usually based around his piano parts. He describes both his songwriting as well as himself as \\"very dramatic.\\" Joseph claims he began writing songs because there were things he wanted to say that he didn't know how to in normal conversation. He is mostly inspired by chord progression and song structure, and his lyrics come afterwards. Joseph usually composes the music first because he has a small studio in his basement. He is able to lay down thoughts musically in terms of chord progression, come up with a melody and then fit the lyrics to that song. Their music inspire song lyrics depending on what is being imparted most of the time. However, Joseph also likes to write poetry so sometimes he‚Äôll musically create a song and then fit the poetry. Dun‚Äôs energetic drumming lays down a stable, equally prominent rhythm for Joseph as he shifts between expressive lyrics of his verses and an almost melodic style of rapping during many of their songs. Alongside their mixture of musical styles, the band melds relatable rhymes with angsty lyrics. Lyrically, Twenty One Pilots is conventionally post-emo. They coincide with a contemporary wave of emo revival fueled in part by millennial nostalgia for popular music from the early 2000s. Joseph's confessional lines convey personal turmoils and deeply rooted insecurities. Their songs contain moments where personal despair connect to a universal context, often relating to that of faith, location or community. Thus making the band more accessible than other more insular emo-inspired artists. Having been raised in Christian households, the lyrics of their songs rarely engage in profanity and shock value. The duo still identify as Christians, and a significant portion of their fanbase interpret lyrics from their songs as an ongoing negotiation with God. From a more secular perspective, their words center on depression and anxiety, with habitual direct reference to self-harm. The lyrical themes most prevalent on the band's major-label debut album Vessel were introspection and fear. Joseph wrote from a very introspective perspective, offering an inside view of what he was going through at the time. He feels that music is a catalyst to getting your emotions going. While he acknowledges many who write songs about love do so because its widely believed love is the most powerful emotion there is, he disagrees with the sentiment. Joseph instead thinks the emotion of fear is equally as powerful, if not slightly more so. As a result, much of Vessel pertained to the power of fear as well as dealing with and trying to find hope, peace and redemption at the end of and inside of fear. Their next studio album, Blurryface was much like a concept album in that it was shaped by intimate themes regarding personal issues such as insecurity. Due primarily to the childhood yearnings of their breakout single \\"Stressed Out\\", Twenty One Pilots have become emblematic of angst-ridden millennial entitlement. The loose concept album is about Joseph attempting to defeat the alter ego of the titular monster-image representing his insecurities and self- hatreds.  Band name, iconography, and fandom  According to the band, their purpose for making music is \\"to make people think\\" and encourage them to find joy in what they come to believe in life. Twenty One Pilots derives their band name and philosophy from literary origins. \\"Bicycle Thief\\" and \\"Chill Coat\\" were among some of the rejected band names. This goes back to college days, according to Joseph, when he was studying theater at Ohio State University.Interview: Twenty One Pilots ; WOUB, March 14, 2012 He got the band's name and meaning from reading the 1947 play All My Sons by American playwright Arthur Miller. In the story, the main protagonist is a war contractor named Joe Keller who crafts airplane parts for war planes. Upon discovering some are faulty and would fail if used, he must decide whether or not to recall them. Keller is forced to make a decision to either spend his money trying to repair the faulty parts or press forward and use them. Though he wants to do what's right, Keller is afraid to lose money and needs to support his family, so he decides to send the parts anyway, to Europe during World War II. As a consequence of his decision, twenty-one pilots perish. At the end of the play, Keller commits suicide. Joseph explained the story's themes of moral dilemma, between choosing the easy and the right decision resonated with him and inspired the name and formation of the band. While the story is morbid, Joseph discovered a lesson within it. It showed him that every decision he makes will have great outcomes or dire consequences. Joseph stated, \\"We're constantly faced with decisions. A lot of times, the right ones take more work, it takes longer to see benefit; they're the long route. We know in order to get where we want to be and do what we want to be doing, sometimes we have to do what we don't feel like doing. It takes hard work, and the band name is a constant reminder of that.\\" Twenty One Pilots' typeface logo as of 2018 The band's name was originally stylized as \\"twenty  one  pilots\\" on their earlier cover art; however, by the time of their second album, Regional at Best, the formatting was changed to \\"twenty √∏ne pil√∏ts\\" with a diagonal line through the Os. Former Twenty One Pilots member Chris Salih stated in an interview that Mark C. Eshleman, a longtime friend of and creative director for Twenty One Pilots, created the band's logo by \\"messing around with shapes\\". Joseph found that the arrangement resonated with him. Regarding their logo, Joseph stated in an interview that: Twenty One Pilots' official logo as of 2018 In 2018, a new logo was unveiled for Trenchs release. An extra slash on each side was added to the previous logo. The color scheme was changed to yellow for the shapes with a solid black background, thus coordinating with the color scheme for the album's cover art. Joseph explained that, \\"If you were to look at those two logos that we had done in the past, and put it together, it would create a logo that is two upward slashes and two sideways slashes. It's kind of a continuation of what we've been working on.\\" He further explained that the extra slashes represent \\"the feeling of being surrounded by something that's protecting you... I knew I wanted that logo to have those extra layers of protection\\". Skeleton Clique logos The band's fandom has been dubbed as the \\"Skeleton Clique\\" or just the Clique, in reference to the band's use of skeleton iconography in many performances, graphics, and music videos. The Skeleton Clique are represented in the band's official iconography by logos of a skull and alien head atop lines resembling keys. In November 2016, during the Blurryface World Tour, the Wood Green tube station in London was decorated in Clique-related artwork, spanning over one- hundred advertising panels. During the 2017 Tour De Columbus, Twenty One Pilots hosted a public art show, dubbed \\"Art√∏pia\\", exclusively for Clique- related artwork at the Nationwide Arena in the United States. Twenty One Pilots became a local favorite in their hometown of Columbus, Ohio thanks to their energetic live concerts. According to Dun, \\"We played hardcore shows, hip hop shows, no one knew where to put us. But we've approached live shows as a way to build something from nothing.\\" The duo usually perform with pre- recorded keyboard tracks and programmed beats rather than a full band. However, Dun also plays a live drum kit while triggering the pre-recorded backing tracks. A former skater, he often breaks his performance up by using acrobatics, such as backflips. Meanwhile, Tyler Joseph wears masks and occasionally body makeup while rapping and singing. He plays multiple instruments while live wearing a balaclava. During their early shows, Joseph would wear a flowered robe onstage. Dun stated, \\"We thought it was kind of cool, new and different to wear masks onstage, but yeah, people were confused.\\"  Band members  Current members * Tyler Joseph ‚Äì lead vocals, ukulele, guitar, bass guitar, keyboards (2009‚Äìpresent) * Josh Dun ‚Äì drums, percussion, backing vocals (2011‚Äìpresent) Former members * Chris Salih ‚Äì drums, percussion, backing vocals (2009‚Äì2011) * Nick Thomas ‚Äì bass guitar, guitar, keyboards, backing vocals (2009‚Äì2011) Timeline  Discography  * Twenty One Pilots (2009) * Regional at Best (2011) * Vessel (2013) * Blurryface (2015) * Trench (2018)  Concert tours  =Headlining= * Regional at Best Tour headlining alongside CHALLENGER!

SIRIS It is located at the Frances Perkins Building, in downtown, Washington, D.C.. The piece consists of nine geometric rhomboid units, bolted and welded together and painted blue. Tony Smith's career encompassed architecture, painting, and sculpture. The General Services Administration commissioned the 21-foot-high steel construction that is painted blue in 1974 for its Art in Public Places program. Smith said that he was willing to forgo the standard honorarium for the sculpture. \\"I felt very honored to do something in the national capital...As far as I was concerned, I would be perfectly willing to supply it at cost‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs right near the Capitol, and it‚Äôs a very nice place to be.\\" The $98,000 fee he was awarded was consumed by the production of the imposing work. Description During the spring of 1976 She Who Must Be Obeyed was installed on the east plaza of the newly constructed Department of Labor building‚Äîsubsequently named the Frances Perkins Building‚Äîin Washington, D.C., not far from the east wing of the National Gallery of Art. Using the jargon of a master builder, which he had been, Smith explained that his sculpture ‚Äúis the cross-section of a space frame made up of tetrahedral and octahedral. It‚Äôs called simply a rhombus.‚Äù For various reasons She never became one of the artist's better-known sculptures. One possible reason: until 2009 it was not easy to see She. The work was placed in an outdoor corner of the t-shaped Frances Perkins Building near Second Street NW, set back‚Äîand difficult to see‚Äîfrom the street. Access to the work was made easier after it was restored in 2008‚Äì2009, and reinstalled on the other side of the Perkins Building, on a grassy plaza close to the intersection of Third and C Streets NW. The construction is also an anomaly in the artist's career: instead of being painted black like most of Smith's other works, or even yellow, like a select few, it is bright blue. Initially, the artist had wanted She to be the color of pool cue chalk. In comparison to the artworks published in the pages of the Museum of Modern Art catalogue that accompanied the retrospective curated by Robert Storr in 1998, it is reproduced in black and white, not color. Because Tony Smith's early structures, works like Die and The Elevens Are Up, were monochromatic, smooth-surfaced, and straight-edged, the older artist was referred to, during this phase of his career, as a Minimalist. His closest friends and colleagues, however, included Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock and Barnett Newman. His work straddles both genres. Title Smith had an open-ended approach to titling his works. Some shapes reminded him of specific objects; others carry the names and initials of dear friends. With its horn-like appendages, Moses refers to Michelangelo's portrayal of that patriarch. Because he was well read, and even had run a secondhand bookstore during the Great Depression, a number of the artist's sculptures have literary monikers. Gracehoper, for example, is a word that appears in Finnegans Wake, James Joyce's Modernist classic. She Who Must Be Obeyed derives from a more populist source, the 1886‚Äì87 novel She: A History of Adventure by H. Rider Haggard, a tale of a lost kingdom.

The colt raced in Abdulla's green, pink and white racing silks and was trained at Pulborough, West Sussex by Guy Harwood. Warning was ridden in all his races by the Irish jockey Pat Eddery. He was sired by the 2000 Guineas and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner Known Fact and thus was a male-line descendant of the Godolphin Arabian, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who trace their ancestry to the Darley Arabian. Warning's dam Slightly Dangerous finished second in the 1982 Epsom Oaks and later became an outstanding broodmare. Apart from Warning she produced The Derby winner Commander in Chief, the Derby runner-up Dushyantor, the Irish Derby runner-up Deploy and the Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes winner Yashmak. She was also a sister of I Will Follow, the dam of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Rainbow Quest. Racing career =1987: two-year-old season= Warning was undefeated in four races as a two-year-old in 1987. After two wins in minor races he was moved up in class for the Group Two Richmond Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse and won at odds of 4/11 from Bellefella and Lapierre (a colt which later won the Group One Prix Jean Prat). In September at Doncaster Racecourse, Warning won the Champagne Stakes, beating the Coventry Stakes winner Always Fair. Warning was scheduled to end his season by meeting another unbeaten colt, Reprimand, in the Group One Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket in October, but was withdrawn from the race as Harwood felt he would be unsuited by the soft ground. The race was subsequently abandoned as a result of damage caused by the Great Storm of 1987. =1988: three-year-old season= Warning was the early favourite for the 2000 Guineas but in his prep race he was beaten four lengths by Doyoun in the Craven Stakes at Newmarket. Shortly after this race the colt was found to be sick and was withdrawn from the Guineas. Warning did not appear until July when he ran in the Bet With The Tote Trophy, a Listed race over one mile at Lingfield Park. He started the 4/9 favourite, took the lead inside the final furlong and won by half a length from Salse. The runner- up went on to win five Group races including the Prix de la For√™t. In July, Warning was matched against older horses in the Group One Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. Eddery restrained the colt in the early stages before challenging in the straight. He finished strongly to win from the five-year-old Then Again and the four-year-old Most Welcome. Two and a half weeks later, Warning was sent to France to contest the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville Racecourse. Despite having \\"every chance\\" in the closing stages, he was beaten a length by the Breeders' Cup Mile winner Miesque at weight-for-age terms with the July Cup winner Soviet Star in fourth. In the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 24 September, Warning started 9/4 joint-favourite with Soviet Star, who had defeated Miesque in the Prix du Moulin. The field also included Persian Heights (St James's Palace Stakes), Magic of Life (Coronation Stakes), Prince Rupert (Waterford Crystal Mile) and Indian Ridge (Jersey Stakes). Warning turned into the straight in sixth place but accelerated to take the lead a furlong from the finish and drew clear of the field to win \\"very easily\\" by five lengths. On his final appearance of the season, Warning was sent to the United States for the Breeders Cup Mile at Churchill Downs. He started the 19/10 favourite but was never in contention and finished tenth of the eleven runners, more than 25 lengths behind the winner Miesque. =1989: four-year-old season= Warning remained in training at four, but won only one of his four races. On his seasonal debut he started 8/15 favourite for the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury, but was beaten two lengths by Most Welcome. At Royal Ascot in June he appeared to recover his best form in the Queen Anne Stakes, taking the lead approaching the final furlong and accelerating clear to win by four lengths from Reprimand. In July he was moved up to middle distances for the only time for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown. He started second favourite but tired badly in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Nashwan, Opening Verse and Indian Skimmer. On his final appearance he was made favourite for a second win in the Sussex Stakes, but finished sixth of the nine runners behind the three-year-old Zilzal. Warning was being prepared for another attempt at the Breeders' Cup Mile when his career was ended by injury. Assessment In 1987 Warning was the top-rated two-year-old colt in Europe's official International Classification with a rating of 125, placing him equal with the filly Ravinella. The independent Timeform organisation concurred, making him their highest-rated two-year-old of either sex with a rating of 127p (the \\"p\\" indicated that they felt the colt likely to improve on his rating). In the following year the colt was officially Europe's best horse, with a rating of 133 placing him one pound ahead of Miesque and two ahead of the leading middle-distance horses Mtoto and Tony Bin. Following a \\"recalibration\\" of historic ratings in 2013, the ratings of all horses in the 1988 classification were moved down by one pound, giving Warning a new official rating of 132. Timeform assigned a rating of 136 to Warning in 1988, making him their highest-rated horse of the year. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Warning the best British-trained racehorse of his generation. Pat Eddery described Warning as \\"a brilliant horse\\" and an \\"absolutely top miler\\" adding that he was \\"a lovely little fellow, not very big but a gentleman\\". Stud record Warning was based at the Banstead Manor Stud and proved to be a successful breeding stallion, particularly as a sire of sprinters. The best of his progeny included Diktat, Piccolo, Give Notice, Charnwood Forest (Queen Anne Stakes), Decorated Hero (Challenge Stakes) and Annus Mirabilis (Dubai Duty Free). He was exported to Japan in 1996 where the most successful of his runners was Calstone Light O, winner of the 2004 Sprinters Stakes. Warning died of heart failure at the Shizunai Stallion Station in December 2000.

The population was 862 at the 2010 census. Warrenton, now served by U.S. 401 and U.S. 158, was founded in 1779. It became one of the wealthiest towns in the state from 1840 to 1860, as it was the trading center of an area of rich tobacco and cotton plantations. It has a large stock of historic architecture. More than 90 percent of its buildings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places and its National Historic District encompasses nearly half its area. History and attractions Warrenton was founded at the time when Bute County was divided to form Warren and Franklin counties. Named for Dr. Joseph Warren, a patriot and soldier who fell at the Battle of Bunker Hill during the American Revolutionary War, it was incorporated in 1779. William Christmas platted and surveyed the streets and lots, and public squares that year. He established one hundred lots of one- half acre each, convenient streets and squares, and a common area for the use of the town. Courthouse circa 1930 The area was developed as tobacco and cotton plantations. Warrenton served as a regional center for trade and entertainment. Many early and mid-19th century houses have been preserved. The planters chartered private academies to educate their children, one of the earliest being The Warrenton Male Academy, formed in 1788. A girls' school was founded by Jacob Mordecai, a Sephardic Jew, whose son Moses became a prominent lawyer in Raleigh. Commercial and government structures in the town date to the late 19th century and early 1900s. In the 1850s, the town became a busy center of commerce when the railroad was built to improve shipping of the commodities of the rich tobacco and cotton fields to markets; it became the wealthiest town in North Carolina of the time. The well-known builder Jacob Holt lived here; he built Greek Revival style houses throughout the region and his workshop supplied millwork to builders even farther afield. As one of the wealthiest towns in North Carolina from 1840 to 1860, Warrenton had property owners who built fine residences and commercial buildings, forming the core of its current historic architecture. They employed the prominent architects Jacob W. Holt and Albert Gamaliel Jones, who designed and built houses in the Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate styles. The Warrenton Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and includes over 200 contributing buildings. The Coleman-White House, Elgin, Liberia School, Reedy Rill, Shady Oaks, Sledge-Hayley House, Mansfield Thornton House, and John Watson House are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Cadmium tetrafluoroborate is most frequently used in the industrial production of high-strength steels, its purpose being to prevent hydrogen absorption, a source of post-production cracking of the metal, in the treated steels. Another application of the chemistry of cadmium tetrafluoroborate is fine tuning of the size of cadmium telluride nanomaterials. While the use of cadmium tetrafluoroborate is limited, concerns about limited or chronic exposure to this substance should be brought to the attention of a physician or other trained medical staff. Exposure to cadmium tetrafluoroborate, via ingestion, contact with the skin or mucous membranes, or inhalation can have lasting and harmful health effects. Preparation Cadmium tetrafluoroborate may be prepared from the reaction between an aqueous solution of fluoroboric acid and cadmium carbonate or cadmium oxide: :{H3OBF4_(aq)} + {CdCO3_(s)} -> {Cd(BF4)2_(aq)} + {HCO3^-_(aq)} + {H2O_(l)} :{H3OBF4_(aq)} + {CdO_(s)} -> {Cd(BF4)2_(aq)} + {HO^-_(aq)} + {H2O_(l)} It is also possible to prepare cadmium tetrafluoroborate through an oxidation-reduction reaction implementing nitrosyl tetrafluoroborate: :{Cd(s)} + {2NOBF4} ->[{ethyl acetate}][{methyl cyanide}] {Cd(BF4)2} + {2NO} Structure = Cadmium tetrafluoroborate = Cadmium tetrafluoroborate is an ionic compound formed from the two, ionic species Cd2+ and BF4‚àí. At room temperature it forms colorless, odorless crystals which are soluble in polar solvents such as water or ethanol. At room temperature, the hydrated salt, Cd(BF4)2¬∑6H2O, exists in a monoclinic crystal system, though this is temperature dependent. Two, first-order phase transitions have been noted in the literature for this material, one each at 324 K and 177 K, representing a change in the crystal system from monoclinic to trigonal and from trigonal to either monoclinic or triclinic, respectively. The quasi-trigonal geometry of the cadmium tetrafluoroborate hexahydrate crystal is unique among the first- row transition metal tetrafluoroborates and perchlorates, which have predominately hexagonal structures. = Related transition-metal complexes = The Cd2+ species of cadmium tetrafluoroborate may associate with various ligands to form transition-metal complexes. The structural formulas and geometries for such complexes can vary depending upon coordination number of the complex and the electronic properties of the ligands (see also, HSAB theory). However, two general forms may predominate: (i) [Cd(L)n(BF4)m], where L and BF4‚àí are ligands in the inner-sphere, and (ii) [Cd(L)n](BF4)2, where BF4‚àí is located in the outer-sphere; for both, n=1,2,‚Ä¶,6. The literature contains reports of distorted octahedral geometries for Cadmium tetrafluoroborate complexes with nitrogen-containing ligands such as pyrazoles and imidazoles and porphyrins. Given the structural formulas for Cadmium tetrafluoroborate complexes noted in the literature however, such as [Cd(L)4(BF4)2], it is likely that tetrahedral geometries are also possible in such complexes.  Uses  = Electroplating = The most significant, industrial use of Cd(BF4)2 is in the electroplating of high-strength steels. Here, species such as cadmium tetrafluoroborate (or Cd-Ti or CdCN) are deposited on the surface of steels in an electroplating process which inhibits absorption of hydrogen onto the surface of the steels, a source of cracking following baking of the metal. Optimization of the electroplating process, adjusting electrolyte concentrations in Cadmium tetrafluoroborate mixes, has been explored in the literature. Among other methods of electroplating, cadmium tetrafluoroborate baths have middling efficiency. It has, for instance, been demonstrated that traditional cyanide bathes (e.g. CdCN or ZnCN) and variants there-of provide more efficient distribution of current density during electroplating, resulting in steels which could bear greater loads. = Nanomaterials = A method of etching of CdTe nanocrystals which removes Cd from the surface of the nano-structures via attack by tetrafluoroborate anions has been reported in the literature. While the presence of Cd-F surface bonds and dissociation of Cd from the surface of the nano-structures are clear from the investigation, complex formation of Cd with BF4‚àí in solution was not discussed though may be inferred from the spectrophotometric results. = Determination of boron in steels by solvent extraction = Methodology has been reported for the determination of boron concentration in steels using cadmium tetrafluoroborate complex formation during solvent extraction to facilitate indirect atomic absorption measurements. Tetrafluoroborate, formed from acid extraction of boron for a steel sample using boric acid, associates with a transition metal complex of Cd2+ and forms a complex which is measureable by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Similar procedures have been implemented for the same purpose using other transition metals and for determination of boron in high-purity silicon using other cadmium tetrafluoroborate transition metal complexes.  Hazards and Safety  = Biological hazards, safety, and treatment = Cadmium tetreafluoroborate is a caustic substance, particularly when in aqueous solution. Multiple routes of exposure, such as ingestion, inhalation, or contact with the skin or mucous membranes, are available through contact with aqueous cadmium tetrafluorobromate. Target biological systems following exposure include the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Symptoms of cadmium tetrafluoroborate exposure include nausea, vomiting, fever, irritation of the mucous membranes (e.g. upper respiratory tract, eyes) and skin, coughing, wheezing, or difficulty breathing. The mechanism of toxicity of this substance is related to cadmium poisoning and exposure to borates and hydrofluoric acid. The compound functions in solution as a weakly acidic inorganic salt, neutralizing bases. After initial exposure, thorough rising of the affected area with water is recommended. However, seeking medical attention is strongly advised as treatment for exposure to Cd or F containing compounds such as cadmium tetrafluoroborate generally involves intravenous administration (I.V.) of calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate for the purpose of maintaining blood pH and sequestering Cd2+ and BF4‚àí in insoluble salts. = Chronic exposure = Chronic exposure to this substance may have negative health consequences. According to its OSHA, IARC, and ACGIH ratings, cadmium tetrafluoroborate is recognized as a carcinogenic substance. Further effects of chronic exposure may include hypocalcaemia and edemas of the respiratory system. = Non-biological hazards and safety = Although this compound is a negligible fire hazard, combustion of cadmium tetrafluoroborate produces hazardous decomposition products including cadmium/cadmium oxide and hydrogen fluoride. Therefore, cadmium tetrafluoroborate is stored out of direct light, in a cool environment, and away from other flammable materials.

The film was jointly produced by Bhansali and Eros International's Kishore Lulla; it stars Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh. The supporting cast includes Supriya Pathak, Richa Chadda, Sharad Kelkar, Gulshan Devaiah, Barkha Bisht Sengupta, and Abhimanyu Singh. Priyanka Chopra made a cameo appearance in the song Ram Chahe Leela. Bhansali conceived Ram- Leela while working on his directional debut Khamoshi: The Musical; an insufficient budget led to the project being postponed. After reviving the project in 2012, Singh and Padukone were cast in the lead roles over many other choices. Principal photography began in Gujarat before moving to Rajasthan. Much of the filming was done on sets, despite previous plans against doing so. The background score was composed by Monty Sharma, while the lyrics were written by Siddharth‚ÄìGarima. The film's release, scheduled on 15 November 2013, was stayed by Delhi High Court. The film initially titled Ram- Leela was changed to Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela in response to an order by the court, allowing it to release on the scheduled date. It received positive reviews, with praise directed to the performances of the cast members, particularly Singh and Padukone. Criticism was focused on its plot and elements of violence. Ram-Leela earned 220 crore in its theatrical run and emerged as the fifth highest-grossing Indian film of 2013 as well as one of the highest-grossing Indian films. Ram-Leela received 8 nominations at the Filmfare Awards, winning three including Best Actress for Padukone. At the International Indian Film Academy Awards, it received nine nominations, including for Best Film, and won two.  Plot In the fictional Gujarati village Ranjhaar, infamous for its uninhibited manufacture and sale of arms and ammunition, two clans‚ÄîRajadi and Sanera‚Äîhave been at odds with each other for the past 500 years. A violent altercation between the two occurs after Bhavani, a Sanera, fires at the son of Meghji Bhai, a Rajadi chieftain. Bhavani is almost killed by Meghji Bhai, but Ram, Meghji Bhai's younger brother, intervenes and saves Bhavani. All the Rajadi elders are irked by Ram being a vagabond who deals in porn films and stolen cars, with his mindset of making a truce with the other clan. During the festival of Holi, Ram boldly enters the house of the Sanera heads and flirts with Leela. Meanwhile, her mother, Dhankor Baa, the chieftain of the Saneras, is busy arranging a match for her daughter with a simple-minded NRI. Leela's elder brother, Kanji Bhai, is angered by Ram's entry into the house and bribes the local police to raid Ram's house. Ram, however, manages to convince the policemen to leave in exchange for a set of his blue films. Ram and Leela develop a romance and plan to elope, but a grim turn of events follows when Kanji accidentally kills Meghji, Ram's brother, and is, in turn, killed by Ram. To escape the suffering, Ram and Leela elope and marry, but just as they are about to consummate their marriage, Ram's friends trace them and betray him by inebriating him and informing Leela's family of their location. The next morning, Leela is forcibly taken back home by Bhavani, her cousin, while Ram is hailed as a hero by the Rajadis for soiling Leela's reputation. He is rewarded by being made the new chieftain of the Rajadis. Meanwhile, Dhankor Baa arranges the engagement of Leela and the NRI, much to the chagrin of the pair. Leela refuses, citing that her finger is already occupied by the ring from her marriage to Ram. In her anger, Dhankor Baa chops off Leela's finger. Upon learning of this, Ram does the same to his own finger and visits Leela while she is asleep. Leela still retains faith in Ram and sends Rasila, the widow of Kanji, to give Ram an ultimatum to take her away. Rasila is assaulted by Ram's friends, and when Dhankor Baa learns of this, she sends Bhavani and other men to assault Kesar, Meghji's widow, who manages to evade them. In response to the attempt on Kesar, Ram storms into Leela's house and incapacitates the guards single-handedly. He then requests Dhankor Baa to consider negotiation for peace, and she invites him to celebrate Navratri with the Saneras, with the intention of having him killed. However, at the event, Bhavani secretly shoots and seriously injures Dhankor Baa to place the blame on the Rajadi. Leela is made the chieftain of the Saneras and gets busy tending to her mother. She bitterly carries out a negotiation with Ram, equally dividing the travel routes and trades, with the condition that the Saneras and Rajadis will not interact with each other ever again. Bhavani, who does not tolerate this development, deceives Leela into blindly signing a document that orders unrestrained killings of the Rajadis. During Dusshera, as the Ramlila parade is ending, many of the Rajadis are killed, and the village is on the brink of war, which Ram senses. Ram and Leela decide that they are each other's soulmates and shoot one another dead, all the while oblivious to the fact that Dhankor Baa has undergone a change of heart and has killed Bhavani, ordering that peace be made with the other clan. The two clans come together to cremate the bodies of the lovers.

The latter was critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful, leaving Bhansali with no money to fund Ram-Leela. He next directed Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam instead, which was also set in Gujarat like Ram-Leela. Feeling that directing two films set in the same place would be repetitive, Bhansali waited. He intended the film to be a tribute to Gujarat, saying, \\"I am Gujarati at heart. I love Gujarat's music, culture and food and I want to take all this back to the people.\\" The film was dedicated to Bhansali's mother Leela. According to him, Ram-Leela was his \\"most violent film\\" at that point, while the filmmaking style was similar to his previous directional ventures Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. Bhansali called it a \\"desi adaptation\\" of William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet. He clarified that Ram-Leela is not related to Rama or Krishna and that the character Ram does not depict the Hindu god. Speaking about the influence of his childhood environment on the film, Bhansali said that his family members used to speak \\"the most outrageously uninhibited things as though they were the most natural\\". He felt that the language heard by him were idioms for the current generation, who speak directly. Bhansali found it \\"very liberating to explore the union of body and mind in a love-relationship\\" and felt that it wasn't enough \\"to show a boy and a girl looking at one another when they fall in love\\". The lovers don't have sex together in the film as Bhansali felt the importance of showing the lovers \\"united completely in death\\". Terming Romeo and Juliet as \\"the mother of all love stories\\", Bhansali wanted to make a different story with it, one that was not yet explored in cinematic adaptations. While changing many aspects of the film, Bhansali kept the theme of \\"misunderstanding between star-crossed lovers\\", while transposing them to another level. The idea of a feud between two families that destroys everything really appealed to him. Acocording to Bhansali, \\"the whole execution of Shakespeare is more flirtatious and voluptuous\\" and he felt his film was the best interpretation of Romeo and Juliet. When asked about the extensive violence and guns in the film, he said that violence is \\"an integral part\\" of Romeo and Juliet, also stating how important it was for a filmmaker \\"to get out of his comfort zone\\". The screenplay was written by writing duo Siddharth-Garima. Producer Sandip Ssingh offered the duo three films; they chose Ram-Leela over the other two. They were impressed by its outline and felt that it was similar to Australian writer Baz Luhrmann's films. In addition to writing, they collaborated with Bhansali for the costumes, recces, shoot days, editing, subtitling, and post production. After writing the initial screenplay draft, Siddarth-Garima were sent to Gujarat for researching dialect, slang and accent. Rhyming couplets from Romeo and Juliet were translated into Hindi and used in the film, with more emphasis on innuendo and humor as they felt that the elements were \\"overshadowed\\" by tragedy in the original play. =Cast and characters= Pakistani actor Imran Abbas was the first choice for Ram, he rejected the role due to \\"contractual obligations\\". Kareena Kapoor and Ranveer Singh were cast in the lead roles in the film. Singh later confirmed the news and conveyed his excitement on working with Kapoor. Bhansali was impressed with Singh's performance in Band Baaja Baaraat and cast him for the film. However, Kapoor walked out of the film 10 days before the shoot began and instead did Dharma Productions's romantic comedy Gori Tere Pyaar Mein. With already complete sets and an approaching filming schedule, Bhansali approached Priyanka Chopra who agreed to do the film. Chopra was officially cast for Leela in July 2012 and was to start filming in August. However, before the filming started Bhansali brought Deepika Padukone in the film. After this unpleasant experience with Bhansali, Chopra stopped talking to Bhansali, as confirmed by the CEO of Bhansali Productions. In August 2012, Padukone had publicly expressed her desire to be a part of the film. After wrapping the filming of his previous film Lootera, Singh confirmed that he was signed on for the film in August 2012. Singh was cast after Bhansali was impressed with his performance in Band Baaja Baaraat. In an interview Bhansali revealed that he met Padukone with the script while she was ill; impressed with her beauty and watery eyes, he cast her. Richa Chadda was reportedly signed on to play a significant role, cast by Shruti Mahajan and Paragg Mehta. Although she initially denied the claim, Chadda later agreed to play the role; she was not given the entire script until a month of filming. For Chadda's role, Bhansali wanted someone \\"with a dusky complexion and Indian features\\", hence she was selected. Bhansali ordered Chadda to watch Mirch Masala to prepare for her look, which was inspired by Smitha Patel. Chadda also attempted to mimic Patel's acting. Barkha Bisht Sengupta, a television actress, plays a supporting role. Sengupta was asked by Bhansali to forget acting for her role. Gulshan Devaiah was reported to play the role of the antagonist Bhavani. Devaiah said that his character was from the Jadeja clan and has \\"enough shades of grey\\" and was \\"nothing\\" like he had done in his career at that point. Devaiah felt that other than the basic frame, Ram-Leela wasn't similar to Romeo and Juliet. Singh, who plays a Gujarati boy, had to learn some Gujarati abuses as well as gain muscle for his character in the film. Singh enrolled for a 12-week transformation programme with Stevens, going on a strict protein diet which involved eating every two hours. He managed to get the required look in six weeks. He was put on a diet of fish, broccoli, turkey and green tea and was prevented from eating roti, rice or sweets. Singh said, \\"I had to work out one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening. I would work out at 5 in the morning, start shooting from 9, shoot for the entire day till 6 pm and then return to workout for an hour again.\\" He felt that the fact he didn't consume alcohol more than once or twice a year helped him to achieve the result before the required date. Padukone was shown wearing a 30 kg ghaghra with a 50-metre 'ghera' in the first look of Ram-Leela. Padukone felt that the film was \\"tough\\" for her, stating that it was \\"mentally, physically, and emotionally demanding\\" for her. She attributes Bhansali's perfectionist outlook as the reason, while admitting she became emotional on the set. For the song Nagada Song Dhol, Padukone had to learn Garba. According to her, the Garba performed in the film was a folk one, rather than the commercial ones often played. Bhansali ordered Padukone and Singh to spend time together to develop their romantic chemistry. Padukone spent more than 12 hours a day for the workshop, which involved partying, watch films and attending premieres together with Singh. Since the two weren't familiar with each other, Bhansali wanted them to socialise. There were rumours that Madhuri Dixit would be performing an item number for the film. Other actresses were also speculated to be signed for the song including Aishwarya Rai and Priyanka Chopra. Chopra was eventually reported to be performing the song. She confirmed the news, saying that she \\"loved the song from the time [she] first heard it\\" and she \\"was challenged to push [her] boundaries.\\" Chopra had to wear full sleeves to hide her muscles acquired for playing the titular character in Mary Kom. The actress also had to workout to lose some of her muscles. =Production design= Sets were constructed to depict markets, which were inspired by those in Gujarat. Wasiq Khan was the production designer for Ram-Leela. Khan finished working on Rowdy Rathore, a film produced by Bhansali, when he was called for Ram-Leela. According to Khan, Bhansali sometimes took 3 to 5 hours for one shot to achieve \\"perfection\\". Since Bhansali wanted to focus on Gujarat's architecture and royal havellis, the film was to be \\"grand and larger than life\\". He said that the challenge was to make the film both a romance and action film as the film would have a \\"rustic feel and texture\\" depicting action scenes, with many people fighting. Khan found it hard to maintain his realistic designs with Bhansali's \\"grand sets, big shots, and beautiful costumes\\". Ram-Leelas design and narrative wrre influenced by the \\"craft traditions and folk culture\\" of houses in the Kutch region of Gujarat. Khan found the experience of creating sets for Ram-Leela \\"different\\" from his previous films. Bhansali and Khan spent about 2‚Äì3 months observing locations and discussed references and drawings. According to Khan, despite the decision to shoot half of the film on the sets and the other half in real locations, 90 percent of the film ended up shot on sets due to difficulties to shoot action sequences in real locations. Some of the sets were created in Reliance and Film City. Interior sets were created at Reliance while an exterior set used to show the mohallas, streets and markets was set in Film City. Khan and Bhansali travelled through villages in Gujarat and got references from the lifestyle, costumes and markets, which were used for putting together the sets. The set of the porn film parlour operated by Ram in the film has \\"neon-lit cut-outs and lurid poster art\\". The storage area of weapons are made so that the guns poke out of \\"straw baskets and from inside shimmering back-lit glass cases\\". The chamber in which Leela and Ram exchange messages has paintings of Raja Ravi Varma hung with \\"diaphanous curtains\\". The walls are rough hued and lined with glasswork patches. The film's costumes were designed by Anju Modi and Maxima Basu Modi designed Padukone's clothes while Basu designed costumes for the rest of the cast. Designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, who previously worked with Bhansali on Black, was hired initially for the costumes of the leading lady, but was later replaced by Anju Modi. Bhansali asked Basu to create a trial look; impressed with it, he chose the design for Singh's character Ram. Ram's look was inspired by Rabari tribesmen. Ram was a character who was \\"exposed to the world\\" yet resides in a village in Kutch, making his clothes have duality. According to Basu, \\"for every ripped jeans or boots he sports, you also see him flaunting a kediyu and kohl-rimmed eyes.\\" The jeans worn by Singh in \\"Tattad Tattad\\" were personally worked on by Basu; she ripped the jeans and added the embellishments herself. Modi journeyed to the Bhoj region of Kutch and bought pieces of antique textiles from the villagers; she had to \\"mix and match\\" it with new fabric to create singular outfits. This was done to make Padukone's outfit \\"as authentic as possible\\". Speaking about using the antique textiles, she said, \\"I wanted to use those old, antique fabrics because it's impossible to replicate the authenticity of those colors, the brocades and those beautiful, fine embroideries that were done by hand.\\" The fabric from which the costume worn by Padukone in the song \\"Ishqyaun Dhishqyaun\\" was over 100 years old. Jewellery was taken from Amrapali Jewels, who lend their antique archives for shooting; these were not for sale. The dialogues of the film were written by Sr. Manager Sawan Vyas After Modi was finalised as the costume designer, she was sent the script for studying the character of Leela. According to Modi, Leela's costumes changed as the film progressed: \\"the attire becomes more mature and darker and she‚Äôs shown in closed neck, long blouses.\\" For the song 'Lahu Munh Lag Gaya', antique Kutch fabric was woven in the skirt worn by Padukone that showed through. For the promotional poster, Modi created a 30 kilo lehenga. Modi also designed Chopra's costume, speaking of the difference with Padukone's costume, she said, \\"Priyanka‚Äôs character is that of a mujrewali or courtesan... since the characteristics of a mujrewali are understood ‚Äì they are sexy, desirable ‚Äì the outfit I made for Priyanka was very fitted to the body but still had to look Gujarati.\\" =Principal photography= Parts of the film were shot at City Palace, Udaipur. Initially shot in Gujarat, some sequences of Ram-Leela were shot in Udaipur, particularly at Udaipur palace and Gangaur Ghat where a song sequence was shot. The story of the film is set in Gujarat. In Udaipur, Singh shot a song sequence in freezing cold water for about 45 minutes. Padukone was injured on set; however she had to continue shooting as an expensive set was put up at Film City for the song \\"Nagada Sang Dhol.\\" Sanjay Leela Bhansali had set up a gym on the sets in Filmcity Mumbai for the lead actor Ranveer Singh to not be late for the shooting and to avoid any delays for the movie. The budget of the film has been estimated to be between and . For the song 'Tattad Tattad', Singh had 30 trials for his costume, after which Bhansali suggested that he shoot shirtless. The classic balcony and conflict scenes were among those that were recreated from Romeo and Juliet. For a few boat sequences in the film, shooting took place at Lake Pichola. While shooting the song Ram Chahe Leela with Chopra, she rehearsed the Indian choreography within four days and completed her shoot. Singh shot Ram-Leela simultaneously with Gunday; due to an injury from shooting Gunday, Bhansali had to postpone the shoot of some scenes. In February 2013, the cinematographer Ravi Varman injured himself on set and suffered a fracture on his hand, leading to shooting being postponed till April. When asked about why Ram-Leela was planned to be shot almost entirely in real locations and not sets, Bhansali said, \\"street rowdyism and gulli-mein-hungama, the desert and the lake\\" were elements present in the film. He contrasted the planned shooting with that of his previous venture Saawariya, which was entirely shot on sets constructed in a studio. Labelling outdoor shooting as \\"a big challenge\\" he added that shooting with different kinds of architecture was \\"interesting\\". He felt that putting the lead pair in a real space was \\"liberating\\" and that he reacted to spaces \\"very differently\\", while noting that parts of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Guzaarish were shot on real locations. Despite the intent to shoot the film in real locations, most of the film was shot on sets due to difficulties. Soundtrack The soundtrack album is composed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, which is his second film after Guzaarish (2010), and lyrics were written by Siddharth‚ÄìGarima. Monty Sharma composed the background score. The album features eleven songs, except one track \\"Mor Bani Thanghat Kare\\" is a 1944 Gujarati song translated by Jhaverchand Meghani and composed by Hemu Gadhvi. The remaining tracks were composed by Bhansali himself. The soundtrack album was released on 2 October 2013 after a delay due to Ranveer Singh's health issues. Daily News and Analysis gave the album four stars out of five and called it \\"a feast for music lovers\\" and writes, \\"Bhansali adds grandeur to the album with his compositions but at the same time gives enough space to the singers to shine.\\" Yashika Mathur of Business Standard stated, \\"The strong point of the \\"Ram-Leela\\" album is the soft romantic songs. Bhansali has put his best 'musical' foot forward.\\" Joginder Tuteja of Rediff.com stated, \\"With just about everything working for the music of Ram Leela, what with classical, folk, fusion as well as contemporary sound finding their place under the sun, Bhansali makes sure that the soundtrack stands out from the clutter of some below average music of some notable biggies that have been making the rounds.\\" Marketing and release The first teaser of the poster, featuring the lead actors standing on a cluster guns, was released in January 2013. The release date was revealed by Padukone on her Twitter account. On 16 September 2013, an official poster was released; the trailer launch took place on the same day. At the launch, a special rangoli poster of the film was created. Divya Goya of Indian Express writes, \\"The film promises to be high on drama and violence as this time 'Love is at War'.\\" It also attracted praise from actor Amitabh Bachchan. Some religious groups opposed the movie claiming that the former title Ramleela was misleading because the movie had nothing to do with Ramlila, traditional enactment of the life and story of Hindu deity, Lord Rama. A local court in Mumbai has issued an \\"ex-parte ad-interim stay\\" over the use of term Ramleela in the movie title. A Delhi court, on 12 November, stayed the release of the movie as per suit filed by six petitioners, including Prabhu Samaj Dharmik Ram Leela Committee, saying the movie hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus. The film's title was changed to Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, leading to the court lifting the stay order and the film releasing on the fixed date. Ram-Leela released on 14 November 2013. The film got widest release 2000+ screens in domestic market and 550 screens in overseas and worldwide with around 2550 screens. Kshatriya community opposed usage of community names in the movie, so Jadeja and Rabari community titles were changed to Saneda and Rajadi. On 21 November 2013, Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court banned the movie in Uttar Pradesh. Ram-Leela had its television premiere on Set Max. Reception =Critical reception= Ram- Leela received positive critical reviews. Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave four and a half stars out of five, writing, \\"Goliyon Ki Raasleela ought to be watched for multiple reasons: the electrifying chemistry between its lead actors, the strong dramatic content, the scintillating musical score, the violent streak in the narrative and of course, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's execution of the material.\\" Meena Iyer of The Times of India gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars, stating that the film has \\"nice doses of raunch and ras\\" and praised the performances of the cast and \\"precision\\" of certain scenes, while noting that the build up of romance could have been better. Writing for Firstpost, Mihir Fadnavis said, \\"The direction, outstanding production design, gorgeous cinematography are supported by a surprisingly strong cast, and Padukone is a wild-eyed anchor in a sea of formula. Three years ago you'd never have expected her to improve so drastically and command the kind of energy she does now.\\" Padukone's performance was well received by critics Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid-Day gave four stars out of five and labelled the film \\"a must watch\\", praising the performances of Pathak, Padukone, Singh, Kelkar, Chaddha and Bisht but felt that Devaviah's talent \\"seems wasted\\". Writing for RogerEbert.com, Danny Bowes gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised Padukone's performance, writing, \\"It is Padukone, as is increasingly the case, who steals the show with pure, deliberate, ferocious star power. The striking thing about her performance as Leela is how tightly coiled and tense it seems; she's ready at a moment's notice to kiss or kill (or both), never passive, never merely a photographic subject.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film three and a half stars out of five and appreciated the chemistry between the lead pair, writing \\"Deepika and Ranveer scorch up the screen in their romantic scenes, their intense passion a bold change from Bollywood's mostly tame embraces\\", and called the film \\"far more engaging than the lazy blockbusters we've seen lately.\\" David Chute of Variety praised the dance numbers, writing, \\"The most effective sequences the two stars have together are the large-scale dance numbers, which are beautifully and imaginatively staged.\\" Sarita Tanwar of DNA gave the movie 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \\"Ram Leela is a lovely mixture of the familiar and the fresh. The technical aspects of the film are extraordinary: breath-taking sets, spellbinding cinematography, perfect music and a wonderful supporting cast. Deepika is perfect in every scene. Ranveer has surrendered to the director's vision and delivers a power-packed performance.\\" Gayatri Shankar of Zee News called the film \\"first-rate\\" and praised the visuals and performances of Singh and Padukone, labelling it \\"one of the finest performances of their careers.\\" However, she found certain portions \\"a little hard to believe\\". Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars and writes: \\"Deepika has stolen the show from her heroes, but this one, I think, belongs to Ranveer. He‚Äôs flamboyant and cheerfully vulgar but also vulnerable and broken.\\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars, concluding \\"'Ram-Leela' creates a couple that ignites the screen, and most of the time when these two are on screen, you keep watching. It's when the guns come on, and the gun-masters start roaring and shouting, that the love-story drowns, and everything gets both too noisy and too choreographed.\\" Writing for NDTV, Saibal Chatterjee gave the film two stars out of five and calls the film \\"all body and no soul.\\" Raja Sen gave one star out of five and called the film \\"an overplotted, bloody mess\\", criticising the dialogues as \\"very poor... awful rhymes alternated with soap-operatic exposition\\". He criticised Singh's performance, while calling Padukone \\"something worth staring at\\". =Box office= Ram-Leela collected 1.52 billion in India and 491 million, for a total worldwide gross of 2.01 billion.

He was the ancestor of the Paget family, Marquesses of Anglesey. Biography Paget was the only surviving son of the Hon. Henry Paget by his second wife Mary, daughter of Colonel Hugh O'Rorke, sometime High Sheriff of Leitrim. Henry Paget was a younger son of William Paget, 5th Baron Paget and brother of William Paget, 6th Baron Paget, and had settled in Ireland.Patrick Cracroft-Brennan, Paget, Baron (E, 1551/2) in Cracroft's Peerage.

Eleanor's parents named her after the Beatles song \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", as they met waiting for a rumored Beatles concert in New York that never happened.DVD soundtrack. =Him= During a meal in a restaurant, Conor reveals to his date, Eleanor, that he does not have enough money to pay for the bill. The two dine and dash. Years later Conor is running a pub and is married to Eleanor. On a break, he visits Eleanor in their apartment, where she is depressed and confined to her bed after the death of their son. She tells him that she dreamed that he had an affair and she thinks it would be better for them if he did cheat on her. Conor is upset by what she is saying, but dismisses it. The following day, returning home, he finds the apartment empty and receives a phone call that Eleanor has been hospitalized following a suicide attempt. At the hospital Eleanor tells him she wants to separate and asks him to let her disappear for a while. Shortly after, Eleanor disconnects her phone and cuts off all communication. Unable to live in their apartment alone, Conor moves back in with his father. While discussing the failure of his marriage with his best friend Stu (Bill Hader), Stu reveals to Conor that he saw Eleanor and believes she is taking classes at NYU. Conor begins to follow Eleanor. Eventually, he goes to one of her classes and passes her a note saying \\"Hi.\\" Eleanor leaves the class and the two have an angry confrontation, with Eleanor insisting that he leave her alone. Conor is hit by a taxi cab as he leaves and Eleanor stays with him until the ambulance arrives. After going over the bills for his restaurant, Conor realizes they are losing money and cannot keep afloat. Depressed, he has a one-night stand with Alexis (Nina Arianda), the bartender of his restaurant. Conor goes to Eleanor's parents' home to try to see her, but instead is confronted by his mother-in-law, Mary (Isabelle Huppert), who gives him little information and suggests that he and Eleanor want different things now. Shortly after, Eleanor comes by the pub and the two rent a car and go for a drive. He tells her that he will be packing up their apartment the following week as he can no longer hold onto it. When it begins to rain and the windshield wipers do not work the two begin to kiss but Conor confesses he has slept with someone else. The two return to the city. Conor throws a closing party for his restaurant. While there, he sees a young couple on a date and notices that they try to dine and dash. He follows them, chasing down the man and tackling him. Ultimately, he decides to let him go. Conor goes to his former apartment to clean it out. He falls asleep, and when he wakes Eleanor is there. The two talk about their son and Eleanor reveals she can no longer remember what their son looked like. Conor tells her that he mostly looked like Eleanor, but with his eyes. The two sleep together, but by the time Conor wakes up, Eleanor is gone. Sometime later Conor is working at his father's restaurant. He decides to take a walk before the late night rush. As he walks, he does not notice he is being followed by a woman who appears to be Eleanor. =Her= While biking over The Manhattan Bridge Eleanor Rigby decides to commit suicide and climbs the barrier and throws herself into the East River. She is successfully rescued. At the hospital she is collected by her sister, Katy (Jess Weixler) who brings her back to their parents' home where Katy, along with her young son, are also living. Unsure of what to do with her life Eleanor decides to listen to her father's suggestion that she re-enroll in school. She talks her way into late registration in professor Lilian Friedman's (Viola Davis) class and the two become friendly. Eleanor's father (William Hurt) also attempts to get her to see a psychiatrist. It is revealed that Eleanor has recently lost a son and has been incapable of coping with the grief. In class one day Eleanor is handed a note and realizes it has been sent to her by Conor. She leaves class and the two have a heated argument where she tells him to leave her alone. Finally assenting, Conor leaves only to be hit by a passing car. Eleanor reveals to the taxi cab driver who hit him that Conor is her husband. Conor is only mildly injured by the incident and before he goes to the hospital he asks if he can see Eleanor again. After Katy tells Eleanor that Conor has been by the house, Eleanor goes to see him at his restaurant, where she learns it is failing. She suggests that they rent a car and go driving aimlessly, something that she had once suggested they do when they were dating. Conor rents the car but it begins to rain heavily and their windshield wiper is broken making driving impossible. While they wait for the rain to pass Eleanor tries to initiate sex but Conor stops her and Eleanor realizes he has slept with someone else during their separation. She tells him it doesn't matter but on the return trip home she gets out of the car early and takes a moment to gather herself before continuing home. The following evening, Eleanor and Katy go clubbing. Eleanor tries to pick up a stranger to have a one-night stand but finds herself unable to go through with it. Instead, she later goes to her former apartment to see Conor. She tells him she can no longer remember what their child looked like and he tells her that their son looked like her. The two have sex, but Eleanor leaves and returns home. At her mother's suggestion she decides to leave for Paris and finish the anthropology dissertation she abandoned when she met Conor. As she says goodbye to her family, her nephew asks when she will return and is told she will come back next summer. Sometime later, Eleanor returns to New York City. She sees Conor and follows behind him for a while before calling out to him.

It is present throughout the country, and is particularly strong in the states of Tabasco, Chiapas, Campeche, Yucatan, Nuevo Le√≥n, Aguascalientes and Mexico City. Today, it consists of more than 6,000 churches and almost 2.8 million members. The National Presbyterian Church is growing rapidly.  History and formation of the church  = Early years = The beginning of Presbyterianism in Mexico dates back to 1827 with the arrival of Diego Thompson, an agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society. Pioneers of Presbyterianism in Mexico include: Dr. Julio Mallet Prevost, WG Allen, Melinda Rankin, Rev. AJ Park and Arcadio Morales. = The Beginnings = The National Presbyterian Church in Mexico was established by missionaries from the United States. Around 1872, the Southern and Northern Presbyterian Churches, the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church and the Congregationalist Church in the United States began working in Mexico. The Northern Presbyterian Church covered Mexico City, San Luis Potos√≠, Villa de Cos and in the Federal District. Later, their efforts were extended into Guerrero, Oaxaca, Veracruz and Tabasco. The Southern Presbyterian Church was active in Texas and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. The first Presbyterian missionaries were Rev. Thompson and Rev. Paul H. Petkin Rev Maxwell Philips P. Mallen Ailen of the Presbyterian Church USA arrived in Veracruz. This work progressed rapidly. Rev Hutchinson stayed in Mexico City while the others moved north to Zacatecas and San Louis Potosi. The Mission in Mexico started with people who broke from the Episcopal church. Mr Arcadio Morales formed the first Presbyterian congregation in Mexico. Morales planted the Divine Savior Church, he became the first pastor of the church, in 1882 the church's membership grew to 552, it became the first congregation that can sustain its pastor. Earlier in 1878 the first 11 Mexican ministers were ordained. = The First Presbytery = On May 12, 1885 the first Presbytery, the Presbytery of Mexico City was organised. Later in 1896 a new Presbytery was organised the Presbytery of the Gulf of Mexico. In the 1890s these Presbyterian missionaries united their efforts. = Formal establishment = In 1901, the National Presbyterian Church in Mexico held its first synod with 73 churches and 5,500 members. Four presbyteries were represented from Mexico City, Zacatecas, Tamaulipas, and the Gulf of Mexico. In 1918, American Presbyterians, the Disciples of Christ and the Methodist church met in Cincinnati, and divided mission work in the country of Mexico between them. American Presbyterians took on the southern part of Mexico and the northern region became the mission field of the Methodists. The Presbyterians get the territory from Tampico to the South and South East, reduced work only the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatan, southern Veracruz and Quintana Roo territory. Presbyterian churches in the north were told to become Methodists, while Methodists in the south were told to worship as Presbyterians. Many churches in Nuevo Leon and Monterrey resisted and stayed in the Presbyterian fold. In Latin America‚Äìaccording to the Plan‚Äìthe Presbyterians get Guatemala, Chile and Colombia, the Methodists get Costa Rica and Bolivia. The National Presbyterian Church did not approve the Cincinnati Plan, considering that the national denomination has already consolidated. Rev. Leandro, who was against the Cincinnati Plan, and he and The Presbyteries of Tamaulipas, Zacatecas, was quit relations with the Southern Presbyterian Church. They feared that the Plan wants to demolish Presbyterians in the North. The Methodists protested because the Presbyterians didn't give temples to the Methodist in North Mexico, but Presbyterians get the Methodist Church buildings in Cuernavaca and Toluca and Morean in the south. On November 28, 1919, the National Presbyterian Church in Mexico was officially formed. = New Constitution = On July 22, 1937 a Constitution was translated by Dr. Enrique C. Thompson was approved in the General Assembly in the city of Toluca by the National Presbyterian Church in Mexico and later approved the revised edition common called the \\"Torres Edition\\".:es:Iglesia Nacional Presbiteriana de M√©xico, A.R = Church developments = In the 1920s, a Ministry among the Chiapas people began first in Spanish speaking population and in 1950 an outreach among Mayan-speaking people was made, such as Chol, Tzotil, Tzeltzal indigenous groups. Today the Chiapas region is among the strongholds of the denomination. Six presbyteries work in the southern regions of the Chiapas, Oaxaca and Potosina and Huasteca, working with local people in their languages. In 1947 the first General Assembly was organized, with nine presbyteries, and in 1972 the denomination celebrated its 100th anniversary of life. The Mexican and US Presbyterian churches agreed to a joint effort of evangelizing. = Recent status = In 1972 the church didn't needed any outside support. The INPM was composed of 3 synods and 18 presbyteries. The church proposed a moratorium to avoid relying on foreign missions to advance the National Church. Because the Cincinnati Plan, the church lost a lot of schools in Northern Mexico, and it broke mission efforts in Northern Mexico for decades. In the 1990s the church had 4,800 congregations, 1.2 million members in 40 presbyteries and 7 synods. By 1997 there were a General Assembly, 8 synods and 50 presbyteries.

The National Presbyterian Church has a relationship with the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), the Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRCNA), the Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC), and the Reformed Church in America (RCA).

The mission partnership between these churches was also dissolved. In the same General Assembly, the Mexican church voted against the ordination of women ministers. The church excluded a women minister from the National church roll in 2013 ordained by the Communion of Presbyterian and Reformed Communion in Mexico, because differences in ways the Bible is read and understandings of women's role in the church.

The Hawks play their home matches on Elmore Field located on the Hartwick campus in Oneonta, New York. The team is coached by John Scott, the seventh head coach in the program's long history. The Hawks are distinguished by being the only Division III program playing Division I men's soccer and by having won the 1977 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship. However, on February 28, 2018, Hartwick announced that the men's soccer program would be moving from D1 to D3. History Hartwick men's soccer was started by Hal Greig in 1956, three years before the NCAA began sanctioning the sport. Building slowly, Greig headed the program for four years, leading the Hawks to their first two winning seasons. Greig was succeeded by David Haase, who in seven seasons had five winning teams, two more with .500 records, and led the Hawks to their first two NCAA Men's Soccer Championship tournaments in 1962 and 1964. Al Miller headed the program for six seasons, leading the Hawks to five NCAA Tournaments, including their first College Cup placing third in 1970. Miller was coach when, in 1972, the NCAA Division II Men's Soccer Championship was begun. Hartwick, along with many other \\"non-major\\" schools, moved into the new division. Following that season, Miller was hired away into the ranks of professional soccer. After only one season in DII, Hartwick and several other of the more prominent DII soccer programs moved back to Division I. Timo Liekoski headed the program for three seasons, gaining three NCAA tournaments, and a second 3rd-place finish in 1974 before he, too, was hired away to the pros. Liekoski was succeeded by Jim Lennox, who remained at the Hartford helm for twenty-seven seasons. Under Lennox, the Hawks advanced to thirteen NCAA tournaments, five College Cups, and the 1977 NCAA Championship. By the time Lennox departed Hartwick for the NSCAA, several of the \\"major\\" athletic conferences had come to emphasize soccer, and the non-major soccer independents like Hartwick were largely overtaken by big-budget major schools. While Lennox's teams made the NCAA tournament in eleven of his first twelve seasons, they made only three of his last fifteen, including missing during each of his last seven seasons at Hartwick. In 2000, Hartwick left the ranks of the independent schools, joining the Atlantic Soccer Conference (ASC). In 2002, Lennox quit the Hartwick post unexpectedly to become Director of Coaching Education for the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA). For his work at Hartwick and the NSCAA, he was named to the NSCAA Hall of Fame in 2013. Ian McIntyre followed Lennox. His Hawks had five winning seasons in seven years. They won the ASC regular season and tournament titles in 2005, putting Hartwick in the NCAA tournament for the first time in ten years. In 2007, Hartwick became an affiliate member of the Mid-American Conference (MAC). Hartwick has been coached by John Scott since 2010. In 2013, the MAC eliminated affiliate members, and Hartwick became an affiliate of the Sun Belt Conference, which added men's soccer in 2014 for the first time since 1995. In the first season in the Sun Belt, while having an overall record of only 6‚Äì10‚Äì4, the Hawks went 3-1-1 in conference competition to win the regular season championship, then won the conference tournament to advance to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005. Building on that success, the 2015 Hawks were 11‚Äì6‚Äì3, repeating as conference champions at 5‚Äì0‚Äì0, winning their second conference tournament, and earning successive NCAA tournament spots for the first time since 1986‚Äì87. Hartwick was playing Division I men's soccer and awarding athletic scholarships to soccer players before the NCAA initiated the non-scholarship Division III in 1974‚Äì75. Several other schools that moved into Division III also were awarding scholarships in ice hockey, lacrosse, or volleyball. These schools (originally nine, now eight) were \\"grandfathered\\" into Division I in their one sport as long as they had sport from the other gender (usually a women's program) also in D1 to meet Title IX requirements (Hartwick chose to start a D1 women's polo program, but eliminated the program when it moved the men's soccer program back to D3 in February 2018).

Biography Karl Bryullov on his deathbed (1832) Son of an artisan Luigi and his wife Paola Marazzi, he was born in Pavia. He followed his brother Giuseppe, an engraver and lithographer at Milan. When he was early 12 years of age, he was admitted to the Brera Academy.La Pittura lombarda nel secolo XIX., Tipografia Capriolo e Massimino, 1900, page 58. In 1835, he participated in the annual exhibition at the Academy, and the next year, along with Domenico Induno, he won a prestigious award. He began a studio, alongside Induno, Giuseppe Mongeri, and Mauro Conconi. In 1838 he painted the portrait of the patron of Solcio di Lesa. In 1839, he painted the Bishop of Lodi, Count . In 1842, he painted the Paolo Erizzo bids Farewell to his Daughters. In 1843, the Brera Academy awarded him a three-year stipend to paint in Rome. There he gravitated to the colony of Italian and foreign artists allied to the Accademia di San Luca, including Karl Bryullov. He attended courses in the French Academy in Villa Medici. In 1850, he was commissioned a fresco on Christ at Emmaus for the Convent of the Cappuccini of Tivoli. In 1853, his painting of Child Moses steps on the Crown of the Pharoah was sent for exhibition in Milan but the judges including Francesco Hayez, severely criticized the work. He works in Garlate and Crema. In 1854, his work was interrupted by the demise of his model and companion Lalla, who had accompanied him from Rome to Milan. He visited Venice and Trieste. Back in Milan, he paints the portrait of Renato Borromeo. In 1856 two altarpieces for the church in Malgrate. In 1857, he proposed painting frescoes for the Duomo of Vigevano, but the commission is assigned to Francesco Gonin. Back in Rome, he continued to paint historical subjects, including events in the life of Leonardo, Michelangelo, Ludovico il Moro, and Galeazzo Sforza. Finally in 1860, the Academy of Fine Arts of Bologna nominated him Professor of Painting with a stipend of 3500 Lire. But within a few months, Cherubino died in Milan at 44 years of age. He was buried alongside his friend Mauro Conconi, who died two days later.

He initially held possessions in east Bosnia, around the Praƒça river, between Krivaja, Drina and Lim, and he had his seat in Boraƒç and Pavlovac between Praƒça and Rogatica. He held mines in Olovo and Fojnica. Early life His father was Radin Jablaniƒá (fl. 1380‚Äìd. 1397), who had possessions in Krivaja and around the Praƒça river. It is possible his sister or cousin was Kujava Radinoviƒá, the second consort of Stephen Ostoja. He was brought up at the Bosnian court. Service and vassalage =Tvrtko I's reign= His scribe was Radosav Milosaliƒá, mentioned in Pavle's charter (March 25, 1387). =Dabi≈°a's reign= After Tvrtko's death, Pavle greatly expanded his realm, and held besides the hereditary territory around the rivers of Krivaja and Praƒça, the town of Boraƒç near Vlasenica, the market of Praƒça, the mine of Olovo. In 1392, Radiƒç Sankoviƒá and his brother Beljak tried to sell Konavle to the Republic of Ragusa.Fine 1994, p. 471 The same year on May 15, Radiƒç issued a charter to Ragusan merchants enabling them to trade in his territories.Klaiƒá 1882, p. 210 However, a council meeting was convoked by the king or nobility that objected the sale; Vlatko Vukoviƒá and Pavle Radenoviƒá were sent against Radiƒç in December 1391 after receiving the council's blessings.Fine 1994, p. 456 The two captured Radiƒç and occupied Konavle, dividing it between themselves, despite protests from Ragusa. The holding of Konavle meant that Pavle held several custom offices towards Ragusa, one of which was shared with Vlatko on Konavljanske Ledenice. Vukoviƒá died shortly after this, and was succeeded by his nephew Sandalj Hraniƒá, who continued to struggle against Radiƒç. When Stephen Dabi≈°a (r. 1391‚Äì1395) died in September 1395, he had designated King Sigismund of Hungary, the husband of his cousin, Queen Mary, as his successor. Mary, however, had predeceased Dabi≈°a, dying in May the same year. The Bosnian nobility refused to recognize Sigismund as king, as his right had rested in his status as Mary's husband. Instead, the nobility installed Jelena Gruba, his widow, and member of the Nikoliƒá family, as the successor to her husband.Fine 1994, p. 458‚Äì =Jelena Gruba's reign= In 1397, his charter secured free trade and protection of Ragusans in his lands, for which he became honorary citizen of Ragusa. In foreign politics, he, as the other magnates of the Kingdom of Bosnia, supported Ladislaus of Naples in his struggle to wrestle the crown of Hungary from Sigismund of Luxemburg. He and other magnates such as Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá (?-1416) and Sandalj Hraniƒá nominally served Queen Jelena Gruba, and were de facto rulers of the kingdom. =Ostoja's first reign= Pavle participated in the decision to crown Ostoja as king in 1398. By the turn of the 14th century, he also held Trebinje, the Vrm ≈æupa (county) with the city of Klobuk and half of Konavle with Cavtat. On April 22, 1404, Ostoja released a charter to the Republic of Venice regarding trade, and at this time Ostoja's court was composed of knez Pavle, vojvoda Vukmir Jurjeviƒá, vojvoda Pavle Kle≈°iƒá, vojvoda Radiƒç Sankoviƒá and knez Radoje Radosaliƒá. Of the \\"magnate triumvirate\\" that dominated Bosnia, only Pavle remained supporting Ostoja. Hraniƒá captured and blinded Radiƒç, and held him in prison until his death in 1404. The area of Nevesinje to the coast was taken by Hraniƒá. Ostoja was deposed in 1404, and Tvrtko II was crowned the new King of Bosnia. =Tvrtko II's reign= After the demise of Ladislaus of Naples and his sale of the right to Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice in 1409, many nobles allied themselves with Sigismund and worked to depose Tvrtko II, who had supported Ladislaus, and they managed to return Sigismund's pretender Ostoja to the throne. Hraniƒá also allied himself with Emperor Sigismund in mid-1411 and decided to establish closer connections with Sigismund's important ally Stefan Lazareviƒá by marrying his widowed sister Jelena (who was the mother of Bal≈°a III, the ruler of Zeta), divorcing Hrvoje's niece Katarina (December 1411). Pavle appointed knez Brailo Tezaloviƒá his protovestijar sometime in 1411. He was ready to sell his part of Konavle to the Ragusans in 1414, but this was never done. =Ostoja's second reign= Political map, ca. 1412. A conspiracy against Pavle was hatched at the stanak held in Sutjeska in August 1415 and attended by all major noblemen except for Hrvoje. At the end of the month, during a walk at the royal court, a dispute erupted between Sandalj and Pavle. Sandalj and his men, joined by Vukmir Zlatonosoviƒá, drew out their swords and captured Pavle's son Petar. Pavle ran, but was caught and decapitated. A retainer of Pavle survived by seeking shelter in a Franciscan home; he later took Pavle's corpse to his estate in Vrhbosna. Petar was supposed to be blinded, but for some reason this did not take place. Pavle's lands were promptly divided between the conspirators. Sandalj justified the murder by accusing Pavle of bringing much misfortune to the Bosnian kingdom. Family *Petar I Pavloviƒá (d.

He gained his PhD in Physics from Harvard, and went on to co-found Reddit, with Aaron Swartz, Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman. He later departed Reddit and began work for Hipmunk, where he was Chief Scientist. He returned to Reddit in 2015 and is currently its CTO. Career Slowe was awarded his Ph.D. in Physics from Harvard for his thesis \\"Experiments and simulations in cooling and trapping of a high flux rubidium beam\\". His thesis advisor was Professor Lene Hau. During his time as a research assistant at Harvard, he also began to devise computer programs. Whilst studying, in the final year of his PhD he and fellow student Zak Stone gained startup monies from Y Combinator for their company Memamps. \\"I just wanted to design something to make it easier to work on my thesis,\\" Slowe explained. \\"And I'll still be happy if that's what I end up with.\\" Memamps failed as both Google and Apple introduced software similar to that which Slowe was seeking to develop. Immediately upon graduating, in what has been considered a startling departure from expectations, he left academia to co-found Reddit, a social news website where users can post links to content on the web. Other users may then vote the posted links up or down, causing them to appear more or less prominently on the Reddit home page. Of this change in direction, Slowe explained that \\"[my] career path may have veered away from the original degree, but that's the nice thing about start- ups - they're usually built around an idea that nobody has previously thought of. In these situations, past experience may not help. What is needed most is insane determination to see something through when failure is a more likely result than success.\\". Of his decision to move away from science and into in an entrepreneurial direction, he notes ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of another decision that has affected me more\\". Slowe had realised that academia was not the road for him. ‚ÄúI got into physics because I liked hard problems, and I enjoyed the process of discovery in solving them. Though the types of problems are drastically different, startup life is structured much the same way.‚Äù Reddit became a successful enterprise, calling itself ‚Äúthe front page of the Internet‚Äù, although it attracted its share of negative news, some of which arose from its \\"hands off\\" editorial approach of allowing content voted as worthy of retention to remain on its site. Reddit's core values include anonymity and protecting identity, and these values center on the concept of open, free and protected speech on its website. Reddit was acquired by Cond√© Nast Publications, the owner of technology Magazine WIRED in October 2006. Conde Nast wanted Reddit to \\"just focus on building out, which may involve adding to the current staff of four (all co-founders), who will all move from Boston to San Francisco and work at Wired's office.\\" A long-standing rivalry also developed between Reddit and Digg, a competing site, and a hostile feud with Gawker, a separate internet comment site, which remains at the time of writing, but by the time of the Violentacrez incident, Slowe had moved on. Fellow co-founders at Reddit departed after the Conde Nast acquisition, Aaron Swartz resigning, and Huffman and Ohanian seeing out the legal duration of their contracts, before moving immediately to Hipmunk, an online travel startup service founded by Adam Goldstein. Slowe remained Reddit's longest standing employee, and CEO, until 2010, when he left to become Chief Scientist at Hipmunk. There was much speculation as to the terms of his departure, but Slowe remained diplomatic, despite rumours of underfunding and understaffing by new owners Conde Nast. In an interview with TechCrunch he stated: \\"I decided to leave mostly because it was time to do something new. Five years in technology is a long time anywhere, and, without suggesting that Reddit is a completed project or anything but a continuously moving and evolving target, it was time to move onto something that is less fully formed with room to explore.\\" Returning again to the theme of solving hard problems, Slowe took on the job of troubleshooting most of the Hipmunk travel software.

He is the editor of The International Journal of Robotics Research, a Senior Editor of Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments, and a Governing Board member of the electronic journal Haptics-e. Early life and education Hollerbach was born in Marktheidenfeld, Germany to Hungarian refugees who met and married in a displacement camp. He and his family lived in a priest's attic in Germany for five years before emigrating to Detroit as refugees. He received his BS in chemistry in 1968 from the University of Michigan but was interested in the growing computer industry and spent an extra year taking computer science courses to receive an MS in mathematics. Following graduation, he worked at IBM as a chemist but took courses in artificial intelligence and computer science as part of an education program with Syracuse University. He then applied to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he worked with Patrick Winston in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory on modeling solid objects and received his SM in computer vision in 1975. He continued at MIT in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science PhD program to study the acquisition of fine motor skills for use in robotics. He obtained special permission to have David Marr as his thesis advisor because Marr was a research scientist and not yet a faculty member at the time. As a result, Hollerbach was technically Marr's first student, although Shimon Ullman was the first student to graduate under him. Hollerbach received his PhD from MIT in 1978. Career Following his PhD, Hollerbach continued at MIT as a research scientist in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory to work on theories of human movement and control and adapting these theories to robotics, and officially joined the faculty in 1982. =Year of the Robot= In 1981 Hollerbach co-founded the Year of the Robot program at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory funded by the System Development Corporation and the Office of Naval Research with the goal of jump-starting serious research in robotics. During the 1970s robotics research was not considered a separate respectable scientific endeavor and was heavily oriented toward industrial robotics with limited vision in potential capabilities. The program aimed to rectify this by accelerating robotics research at MIT over a five-year period by supporting writing of a sourcebook on robotic manipulation, starting an annual high-level international academic conference and research journal, outlining an educational program, and building a dexterous and controllable robotic hand. In 1982, Hollerbach co-produced a robot motion sourcebook with J. Michael Brady, Matthew T. Mason, Tomas Lozano-Perez, and Timothy Johnson. The book contained sections on dynamics, trajectory planning, compliance and force control, feedback control, and spatial planning; each section had a substantial introduction that served as a tutorial in addition to research papers by 19 top robotics researchers, including Marc Raibert, Robin Popplestone, and Pat Ambler. An updated version of the sourcebook was published in 1989 edited by J. Michael Brady. In 1983, Hollerbach helped start the International Journal of Robotics Research and the International Symposium of Robotics Research. =Utah/MIT Dexterous Hand= As part of the Year of Robotics program, Hollerbach collaborated with Stephen Jacobsen and John Wood at the University of Utah to design, construction, and control a multi- fingered hand. The project began in 1981 and was completed in 1987. The hand design consisted of a 16-joint four-finger manipulator that used 32 artificial tendons sensing via the Hall effect. 12 copies were made for use in a variety of contexts. At the NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Ken Perlin, James Demmel, and Paul K. Wright obtained a copy to build simulation software for the hand. Carnegie Mellon University, Columbia University, University of Rochester and other university research labs obtained copies to explore multi-agent control, teleoperation, and apprenticeship learning. =Medical robotics= In 1989 Hollerbach left MIT and accepted a NSERC/CIFAR Industrial Chair at McGill University. He hired Martin Buehler as a Junior Chair and formed a joint laboratory with Ian Hunter to work on fundamental actuator design. In 1994 Hunter moved to MIT to start a group in bioinstrumentation and Hollerbach joined the faculty at the University of Utah to develop medical robotics. At Utah, he developed the TreadPort Active Wind Tunnel, an immersive virtual environment that mimics the haptic properties of walking using sensory cues to aid in rehabilitation.

Background Darayya is a suburb of Damascus where rebels have attempted to create a stronghold near Damascus center. In August 2012, the Syrian Army defeated the rebel forces and took control of the town. After the failed rebel offensive in late July 2012, the Syrian army started a campaign against rebels in Damascus suburb that led to a massacre in Darayya with an estimated 500 people were found executed, with rebels and government accusing each other of being responsible for the massacre. Battle The rebels again took control of the town in November 2012. Since, the city has been cut off, its electricity cut and has witnessed a continuous shelling. Most of the residents fled as soon as the battle started. The rebels were successful at preventing the Syrian Army from entering the town until mid-December when the Army started to intensify their attacks on the city and the nearby city of Moadmiyah. On 20 December, after 30 days of siege, the newspaper Al Watan, close to the government, reported an army progress into Daraya, where the army penetrated the city and isolated rebels fighters in the city center. Al Watan added that most of the fighters were foreigners. On the 31 December, the Army launched its biggest attack on the city, with columns of armed vehicles trying to progress into the city. The rebels attempts to hit the presidential palace and Alawites neighbourhood with their homemade rockets were one of the reason for the assault. On 4 January, an opposition activist reported that the Syrian army was meeting a very strong resistance in Daraya, but that the Syrian soldiers managed to advance into the main street. The army was also firing from their artillery positions located in the Mount Qasioum on the orchards around Daraya. The Syrian Observatory, a rebel group, told that the army was sending more reinforcement to Daraya, while Al Watan newspaper wrote that the Army won the Daraya battle. On 5 January, the Syrian Army arrested Mohamed Zawahiri, the brother of the supreme leader of Al Qaida in Daraya. Russian today Arabic correspondent was slightly injured when he fell on his hand while running to avoid being caught in crossfire. His report showed the army in control and patrolling most of the town. Rebels spread into different areas of Darayaa and the army still needed several mopping up operation to declare the area as safe. On the same day, the pro-opposition group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 10 people died in the fighting, including 6 rebels. On 6 January, the Syrian army killed a number of rebels near the Al Qasheia school in Daraya, and named the following rebels Odai al-Ward, Ahed Radwan, Moutez Mansour, Khaled al-khateeb, Omar Madwa, Tareq al-Dabbas, and Muhammed Tabow as being among the dead. Several other rebel groups were killed by the army in the other Damascus suburbs, including 12 who were named by the Army. On 8 January, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that the Syrian Army had taken control of parts of Daraya and was sending more soldiers to push for the full conquest of the town. On 13 January, concording sources, from security officials to rebels groups revealed that the Syrian Army had taken much of Daraya, entering most of the neighbourhoods. On 19 January, it was reported that the rebels were still in control of parts of Daraya in spite of fierce clashes and heavy shelling by government forces. Rebels also claimed that a MiG pilot in Daraya had defected and used his fighter jet to bombard three Army positions in the area, killing 15 soldiers of the 4th Syrian Army Brigade. Although this was not independently confirmed. The rebel commander Abu Ali was killed in the shelling of rebels positions. On 24 January, the government was shelling Daraya from positions on the Qasioun mountain range west of Damascus. On 14 February, the Syrian Army attempted to push further into Darayya, but rebels were able to repel the offensive. Aftermath In early August, state media reportedly showed that al-Assad visited his troops in Darayya, although SOHR was reporting the Syrian army shelling Darayya as recently as late June, and opposition activists report fighting as recently as mid-July. Additionally, Russia Today reported one of its journalist was wounded the same week in Darayya from rebels within the city firing mortars back. On 30 December 2013, Syrian government helicopter gunship targeted Darayya with three barrel bombs. The barrel bombs landed near Al-Ansari and Al-Mustafa mosques, in the western part of the city, which has been under a tight siege by government forces for over a year.

The neighborhood was previously referred to as \\"Dickinson Narrows,\\" but was officially reestablished as \\"Dickinson Square West\\" in 2013 by the Registered Community Organization, Dickinson Square West Civic Association, located within its boundaries. In October, 2018, The Dickinson Square West Civic Association passed an amendment to expand the southern boundary from Mifflin Street to Snyder Ave Boundaries The boundaries of Dickinson Square West are Washington Avenue to Snyder Avenue, and Fourth to Sixth streets. History Long before William Penn and the founding of the city of Philadelphia, or even the arrival of Swedish settlers, the Lenni Lenape Indians claimed the land they called Weccacoe (pleasant place), now known as South Philadelphia. In 1638, Weccacoe became part of New Sweden when the early Swedes established Fort Christina (now Wilmington, Delaware) and settled along the Delaware River as far north as present day Trenton, New Jersey. The Dutch briefly claimed control of what is now southeastern Pennsylvania from the Swedes in 1655, but the land was quickly ceded to the British, and in 1682 the king of England granted a land charter for what is now Pennsylvania to William Penn. Penn renamed Weccacoe Southwark, after a neighborhood in London, England. Penn's new city of Philadelphia quickly grew along the Delaware River waterfront and spilled over its original southern boundary of Cedar Street (now South Street) by the early 18th century. By 1687, the Southwark District (now South Philadelphia) was divided into two townships, which retained their original American Indian names, Moyamensing (pigeon droppings) and Passyunk (in the valley). Provincial secretary Richard Peters noted the dramatic changes in Southwark's appearance as early as 1743, when he wrote to Governor Thomas Penn,\\"Southwark is getting greatly disfigured by erecting irregular and mean houses; thereby so marring its beauty that, when he shall return, he will lose his usual pretty walk to Wiccaco.\\" Peters may have been referring to the wood-framed buildings that were common throughout Southwark. Whole blocks developed seemingly overnight; wooden houses were cheaper to construct, but harder to maintain. Pascal Iron Works Philadelphia (1861) During the 19th century, Pascal Iron Works was situated in the squares between Moyamensing road and Fifth street, and Franklin (later Tasker) and Morris streets,Ernest Hexamer. Hexamer General Surveys, Volume 27, Plates 2592-2593, Pascal Iron Works Map Collection, Free Library of Philadelphia (Accessed Sep 11, 2019) then only the block between Fourth and Fifth streets. Stephen Paschall (1800-1865) formed Paschall Iron Works in 1821. In 1835 he was joined by his brother, Henry Morris, and Thomas T. Tasker, a Philadelphia preacher with a penchant for mechanics, to form S. P. Morris & Company. Sometime between 1835 and 1856, S. P. Morris & Co. became known as Morris Tasker & Morris, when another brother, Wistar Morris (1815-1891), took the place of retiree Stephen Paschall. By 1856, the organization's name had changed once more to Pascal Iron Works and Morris, Tasker & Company. These companies manufactured a number of different iron products throughout the 1800s, including stoves, grates, pipes, valves, fountains, radiators, and fire hydrants.The Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Collection 2000B, Morris family Papers, 1695-1965, Pg. 3Pascal Iron Works, Morris, Tasker & Co's Illustrated Catalogue, Fourth Edition, 1861Illustrated Catalogue, Pascal Iron Works Philadelphia, Tasker Iron Works New Castle, Del., Tenth Edition, June 1st, 1871 Newcomers in the early 20th century continued to move farther south. This is evidenced by the building of Mt. Sinai Hospital (recently demolished) in 1921 by Russian Jews between 4th and 5th streets along Reed street, between the community‚Äôs initial center at 5th and Bainbridge streets and the area south of Snyder where it would relocate. By World War I, 7th Street, mostly south of Tasker Street, had become ‚Äúa shopping mecca,‚Äù where Jewish merchants sold anything that could be bought. It would become the major artery of the Jewish neighborhood in South Philadelphia, surrounded by important community centers like the Workmen‚Äôs Circle on 6th Street and Tasker Street. After World War II, many of South Philadelphia's ethnic enclaves began a long and steady decline as the children of new immigrants left the neighborhood for other parts of the city and nearby suburbs.  Present day  Dickinson Square West is a narrow, two-block-wide strip of land stretching from Washington Avenue on the north to Snyder Avenue on the south from 4th to 6th streets. It came into existence mainly because of the city's zoning code, which formalizes the role civic and community associations have historically played in reviewing and approving requests for zoning variances. Dickinson Square West is a unique and exciting part of that patchwork and is quickly becoming a high point of the Philadelphia real estate market. The area imbibes and accentuates all of the greatest attributes of South Philadelphia‚Äôs extraordinary charm, which is emphasized by its selection of parks, playgrounds, small businesses, and restaurants.

Retrieved January 1, 2017. (2 October 1708 ‚Äì 1750), was a Scottish politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1727 until 1733 when he succeeded to the peerage as Earl of Sutherland. He was chief of the Clan Sutherland, a Scottish clan of the Scottish Highlands. Early life Sutherland was born as William Gordon, the eldest surviving son of William Gordon, Lord Strathnaver and his wife Catherine Morrison, daughter of William Morrison, MP, of Preston-grange, Haddington. His father died in 1720 and he succeeded his elder brother on 12 December 1720. He undertook a grand tour in France and Hanover from 1726 to 1727. At the 1727 British general election Sutherland was put up by his grandfather for the constituency of Sutherland at the age of 18. There existed a resolution that the eldest sons of peers of Scotland should not sit in the House of Commons and his grandfather expressed the hope to the Duke of Argyll that this would not be invoked, because Sutherland was a grandson, and not a son. He was returned as Member of Parliament without difficulty. In 1730 he claimed repayment for arms surrendered to the Government, under the Act for disarming the Highlands, but his claim was deferred because some of his receipts for arms appeared very suspicious. He voted with the Administration on the Hessians in 1730 and on the excise bill in 1733. When he succeeded his grandfather John Gordon, 16th Earl of Sutherland as 17th Earl of Sutherland on 27 June 1733, he was said to have made a deal with Walpole and Ilay by which, he would vote for the court list of representative peers, provided he was made one of them himself, which transpired in 1734. He was also appointed a lord of police in Scotland at ¬£800 p.a., and granted a pension of ¬£1,200 p.a He vacated his seat in the House of Commons. In 1744, he was promoted to be first lord of police. Jacobite rising of 1745 The grave of George, 15th Earl of Sutherland, Holyrood Abbey During the Jacobite rising of 1745, Sutherland supported the British- Hanoverian Government and raised two independent companies on behalf of the Government. At one stage, the Jacobites stormed the Earl's home at Dunrobin Castle, but he narrowly escaped them through a back door and sailed to join the army of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland. One day before the Battle of Culloden an Independent Highland Company of soldiers that were raised from the Clan Sutherland by the Earl of Sutherland, took part in the Battle of Littleferry in support of the Government where the Jacobites were defeated.Sutherland, Malcolm.

He was also present at the Battle of Culloden where the Jacobites were finally defeated. Despite of this some people in the Government were unhappy with the Earl's strength of support and he struggled to prove to the parliament in London that he had not had Jacobite sympathies.Clan Sutherland History clansutherland.org. Retrieved 4 May 2013. Later life Sutherland joined the party of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and as a result lost his police post in 1747. He wrote to the Duke of Newcastle on 30 July 1747, complaining of the loss of his post and seeking recompense for his expenditure during the Jacobite rising. He waited around court for two years, leaving his mother in charge of the management of his estates in Scotland and then decided to go abroad. Sutherland died at Montauban in France on 7 December 1750, leaving debts of ¬£15,797, and was buried in the grave of his great-grandfather, Gordon, the 15th Earl, in Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh.

Perspecsys has offices in the Toronto area; Tysons Corner, Virginia; San Francisco, California; London, England; Paris, France; and Berlin, Germany. Perspecsys specializes in cloud data privacy, data residency/sovereignty, and data security software that enables compliance with industry regulations and directives, and security requirements when adopting cloud. Banking and financial services, healthcare, retail, and government entities must adhere to strict guidelines when handling sensitive personal data in cloud applications that include: PCI DSS, ITAR, FERPA, HIPAA, and HITECH.  Technology  The AppProtex Cloud Data Protection Gateway secures data in software as a service and platform as a service provider applications through the use of encryption or tokenization. Gartner refers to this type of technology as a cloud encryption gateway, and categorizes providers of this technology cloud access security brokers. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted Perspecsys U.S. Patent No. 9,021,135 for its System and Method for Tokenization of Data for Storage in a Cloud. The main component of the cloud encryption gateway is the AppProtex Cloud Data Protection Gateway Server, which acts as an intercepting software proxy. The gateway server provides the core data privacy, residency, and security services for the gateway. AppProtex Discovery & Analyze capabilities allow visibility into information users are sharing with cloud applications. Users may define encryption, and tokenization options at the field-level. The cloud data protection gateway allows encryption with any third-party JCA/JCE- compliant cryptographic module, including FIPS 140-2 (Federal Information Processing Standard) validated modules. Cloud data is secured, and end-users maintain full functionality, such as the ability to search, sort, and e-mail using data that has been either encrypted or tokenized. The data that flows between the cloud application, and the end user is interpreted by the Gateway. For cloud applications that feature email, the AppProtex Communications Server can enable the secure transfer of email. Additionally, AppProtex Server facilitates the deployment of the cloud security gateway via IaaS partners such as Amazon Web Services, CSC, and Fujitsu. Perspecsys is a Salesforce AppExchange Partner and provides tokenization or encryption of Salesforce.com, Chatter, Force.com, and Wave Analytics Cloud Data. The AppProtex Cloud Data Protection Gateway secures cloud data across cloud applications, including Oracle CRM on Demand, Oracle Fusion CRM, ServiceNow, SuccessFactors, AppExtremes, and Xactly Incent.  Standards  Perspecsys cloud encryption gateway uses either tokenization or encryption for cloud security. Its tokenization option was evaluated by Coalfire, a PCI DSS Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) and a FedRAMP-accredited Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), to ensure that it adheres to industry guidelines. The gateway also allows encryption modules from other third-party providers (such as McAfee, Voltage Security, SafeNet, and Symantec) to encrypt cloud data, including modules that are FIPS 140-2 (Federal Information Processing Standard) validated, issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  Funding & Acquisition  In May 2013, Perspecsys secured $12 million in Series B funding, co-led by Paladin Capital Group and Ascent Venture Partners and joined by return backer Intel Capital and other existing institutional investors. Together with Series A funding, this new round of financing brings the total investment in Perspecsys to over $20 million. Perspecsys‚Äô Series A round of funding totaled $8 million and was led by Intel Capital, the global investment branch of technology company, Intel in May, 2011. GrowthWorks, and MaRS Investment Accelerator Fund have also invested in Perspecsys. On July 30, 2015 Blue Coat Systems announced it had acquired Perspecsys in order to expand its cloud security offerings. The acquisition price is estimated to be $180‚Äì200M. Subsequently on the 12th of June 2016, Symantec Corporation announced that it would be acquiring Blue Coat Systems for approximately $4.65 Billion in cash. Greg Clark, Chief Executive Officer of Blue Coat, was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Symantec.

In the early and mid 19th century, Jan Czeczot, Wladyslaw Syrokomla, Wincenty Dunin- Marcinkiewicz, Jan Barszczewski and several other writers, most of whom represented the local nobility, created the first literary works in modern Belarusian language. Their works were written in local rural dialects and ignored the traditions of the written Old Belarusian language from the period of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the second half of the 19th century, leftist national clubs emerged among Belarusian students in the major universities of the Russian Empire, i.e. in the University of St. Petersburg. These clubs issued several illegal publications, for example, Homan with demands for autonomy or independence for Belarus.

He has been described as \\"a father of confederation for entomology\\" by Robin Stewart. Early life DuPorte was born in 1891 in Nevis, one of the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean that was then part of the British West Indies. He began his education at the Charlestown Boys Primary School in Charlestown, where he excelled and drew the attention of H.C. Huggins, who awarded him a scholarship for secondary school studies at St. Kitts-Nevis Grammar School in Basseterre. In 1910, he was awarded a scholarship from the St. Kitts-Nevis Legislative Council, which he used to attend Macdonald College in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He began his studies in zoology there in October 1910, completing his Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (BSA) in three years. He became the first zoology graduate to earn a Master of Science (M.Sc.), which he completed in 1914, and a PhD, which he completed in 1921, from McGill University. His thesis was \\"a pioneering work on orthoptera\\". Teaching and research He began teaching at McGill in 1913, the first Black Canadian to do so, teaching entomology, genetics, parasitology, and other courses. He influenced the curriculum taught at the college, which became renowned for entomological study. He was renowned at the school for the class known as Zoology 220, for which he maintained high standards, and which many students had to repeat, including future McGill University professors. In 1924, he became one of thirteen members of the newly established Sigma chapter of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. It was the fraternity's first chapter in Canada. It became inactive, and was later moved to Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. In 1934, he began research on ticks as disease vectors, and eventually requested government funding that was used to establish the Institute of Parasitology at the college, increasing Canada's prominence in parasitology research. DuPorte had previously drawn attention to the issue of animal parasites in agriculture. He became head of the Entomology Department in 1955 after functionally leading it for decades, a position he maintained until his retirement in 1957. By that time, he had taught more than half of Canada's practicing entomologists. He was offered funding collected from 137 of his former students so he could travel with his wife across Canada; during the trip, he visited laboratories of his former students. In 1959, Reinhold Publishing Corporation published the first edition of his book Manual of Insect Morphology. A classic text in the field, it ultimately had fifteen printings of five editions published. Legacy and awards DuPorte became a Fellow of the Entomological Society of Canada in 1977. In 1963, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Science by Carleton University. In 2010, he was registered in the Persons of National Historic Significance, a register of people designated by the Government of Canada as being nationally significant in the history of the country. The E. Melville DuPorte Award was established at McGill University from an endowment, and awarded since at least 1986. It is a $500 scholarship awarded to a student having completed the first year of graduate studies in entomology at the Department of Natural Resource Sciences, based on departmental recommendation to the scholarship committee of the Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. In 1980, the Soci√©t√© d'entomologie du Qu√©bec established a bursary that it awards to one of its student members registered at a university for full-time study. It is based on a scientific presentation of the student's research at the annual meeting of the society. Since 2010, two additional prizes have been awarded for best oral presentation. An annual memorial lecture, the Dr. E. Melville DuPorte Lecture, is presented by the Department of Entomology with support from the Dean of Agriculture. A plaque in DuPorte's honour is located in the Lyman section of the McGill University Library at the Macdonald Campus.

The story follows a teen (Carter), who is pregnant with her brother's child and tries to escape from a backwoods community, only to discover that she must sacrifice herself to a creature in a pit. Plot A backwoods community worships a pit with healing powers. Dawai creates jugs of faces from clay, and when a jug portrays the face of a member of the community, that person must be sacrificed to the creature that lives in the pit. Ada, who has been having sex with her brother Jessaby, finds her own face on Dawai's latest jug. Scared, she hides the jug and keeps it a secret. Ada is arranged to be \\"joined\\" to a boy from another family, Bodey. Later, Ada discovers she is pregnant. While she is with Bodey's sister, Eileen, Ada has a vision of Eileen's death, and the creature later kills Eileen. Worried that they have angered the creature, the community questions Dawai, who claims to be ignorant of whether there's a missing jug, as he creates them while under a trance. The townspeople become frustrated with Dawai and demand that he search for any potentially missing jugs. Ada meets with Dawai, and she suggests that he create a new one from memory. Ada's mother, Loriss, inspects her to see if she is a virgin, and Ada claims to have broken her own hymen. Loriss punishes Ada, who later informs Jessaby that she is pregnant. The following day, the community gathers around the pit as Dawai presents his latest jug with the face of Bodey, who is sacrificed. Ada visits her sickly grandfather and sees a vision of an emaciated boy, who explains that her grandfather hid his wife's jug face the same as she did, and the community poisoned her grandfather as punishment. Jessaby tells Sustin, his father, that he is sick, so they go to the pit to heal him. Ada has a vision of Jessaby getting killed; the vision comes true. As it seems Dawai has failed again in interpreting the pit's desires, he is severely punished by the community and tied beside the pit to be taken. Ada breaks Dawai free, and they run off. However, the two are caught, brought back, and punished. Assuming that it is Dawai with whom Ada had a relationship, Ada is whipped, miscarries her child, and then reveals to her parents that it was her brother's baby. Ada has a vision of her father's death, and the creature kills him. She reveals to everyone that she was the missing jug face and that all the deaths are her fault. Her mother ties her up beside Dawai next to the pit. The Shunned Boy and Ada's grandfather appear and free her from her ropes, but she will not leave because she knows Dawai will be killed. The next morning, Ada's mother finds her free of her ropes but kneeling beside the Pit. Ada apologizes and is sacrificed. The film ends as Dawai lights a candle next to his jug face of Ada.

It was announced in January 2012 that Lauren Ashley Carter, Sean Bridgers, Larry Fessenden, and Sean Young were cast in the film. Young said that she found it difficult to play an unsympathetic character, but she enjoyed working with Carter and Fessenden. Young was deliberately made to look old, which she said was helped by the custom-made clothing. Potter and sculptor Jason Mahlke designed and created the face jugs for the film. Release The film was accepted at a number of film festivals, including its premiere at the 2013 Slamdance Film Festival. In 2013, it played at the Boston Underground Film Festival, Nashville Film Festival, and Nocturnal Film Festival. After its premiere at Slamdance, Jug Face was acquired for a pre-theatrical VoD release in July by Gravitas Ventures, with a national theatrical release to follow.

Although, it's carried by strong performances, and a few explicate [sic] shots of gore.\\" Brad McHargue, writing for Dread Central, praised Kinkle's script, as well as \\"the stellar performances of Carter and Bridgers.\\" McHargue called it \\"loaded with talent\\" and \\"filled with emotion and just enough blood to keep the gore hounds satisfied.\\" Ryan Larson, a writer for Shock Till You Drop, wrote that \\"Jug Face isn't a groundbreaking movie. But it's exceptional on a number of levels and is so because of a powerful director and some great acting.\\" Scott Weinberg, writing for Fearnet, praised the acting and wrote, \\"[T]he director's steadfast insistence on presenting a potentially outlandish horror tale as plainly and realistically as possible that elevates Jug Face beyond that of a mere curiosity.\\" Rob Nelson of Variety described it as \\"an impressively oozing slab of indie horror that bodes well for first-time writer-director Chad Crawford Kinkle.\\" While the film is mainly praised for its script, effective low-budget filmmaking and performances, the story's supernatural elements received some criticism. In a Fangoria review, Samuel Zimmerman wrote: \\"While Jug Face is clearly on a tiny budget, it‚Äôs never bothersome until the frankly cornball appearance of the dead is revealed.\\" Zimmerman adds, \\"These rough patches are slightly alleviated thanks to grounded work from Jug Face‚Äôs cast and Kinkle‚Äôs own depiction of this small community.\\" In a Twitch Film review, Ben Umstead wrote, \\"While steeped in thick atmosphere and anchored by some interesting riffs on classic horror tropes the film is far more underwhelming in execution than it is dynamic and provocative ‚Äî elements that feel largely left on the page.\\" Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, \\"Some low- budget manifestations of the supernatural jazz up the frights now and again, but as the novelty of worshiping a hole in the ground fades, the film paints itself into a corner.\\" References External links  Jug Face on AllMovie * Jug Face on Rotten Tomatoes * Category:2013 films Category:2013 horror films Category:American films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:Incest in film Category:Films shot in Tennessee Category:American ghost films Category:American exploitation films ","title":"Jug Face"},{"id":"38339669","text":"Ra√∫l Chappell Morales (July 23, 1911 in Callao, Peru ‚Äì 1977 in the United States) was a Peruvian football player.

Begun in 1848 but not finished until Millet found a buyer in 1852, it depicts a peasant man pushing a wheelbarrow. Description In Peasant with a Wheelbarrow, Millet took a peasant farmer with simple clothes and tools, and transformed him into a symbol of the dignity of manual labor. The peasant is utterly idealized, bathed in a golden light and transmuted into an emblem of a vanishing way of life. Historical information Moving to Barbizon in 1849, Millet quickly became associated with the Barbizon School. Although he shared their enthusiasm for painting fresh, outdoors scenes, Millet also liked to depict the local farmers. He found the nobility of the peasants, with their lives grounded in the soil, a welcome change from the instability of modern life. The school was brought to its highest prominence by the Revolution of 1848. The classically trained Millet was making a powerful political statement with this image, which raised a humble rural scene to the same level as a history painting. This intimate portrait reveals Millet's poetic side. Soon, he would transition to epic canvases for the Salon. =Acquisition= Peasant with a Wheelbarrow was acquired by the IMA in 1949, a gift of the James E. Roberts Fund and the Alumni Association of the John Herron Art School. It is currently on view in the Norb & Ruth Schaefer, Sr. and Norb & Carolyn Schaefer Jr. Gallery and has the accession number 49.48.

Coined by psychoanalyst John Fl√ºgel in 1930, it is considered a major turning point in the history of clothing in which the men relinquished their claim to adornment and beauty. The Great Renunciation encouraged the establishment of the suit's monopoly on male dress codes at the beginning of the 19th century. French fashion plate from 1813 depicting a man in a suit. History The Great Male Renunciation began in the mid-18th century, inspired by the ideals of the The Enlightenment; clothing that signaled aristocratic status fell out of style in favor of functional, utilitarian garments. The newfound practicality of men's clothing also coincided with the articulation of the rational man and the frivolous, emotional woman. During the French Revolution, wearing dress associated with the royalist ancien regime made one a target for the Jacobins. Working class men of the era, many of whom were revolutionaries, came to be known as sans- culottes because they could not afford silk breeches and wore pantaloons instead. The term was first used as an insult by French officer Jean-Bernard Gauthier de Murnan but was reclaimed by these men around the time of the Demonstration of 20 June 1792. In the United States, the movement was associated with American republicanism, with Benjamin Franklin giving up his wig during the revolution, and later the Gold Spoon Oration of 1840 denouncing Martin Van Buren. The post-Renunciation standards for men's dress went largely unchallenged in the Western world before the rise of the counterculture and increased informality in the 1960s. Characteristics Dark-colored or black clothing became the standard for men's apparel during the Renunciation. High heels, adopted in Europe at the beginning of the 17th century based on Persian riding shoes, fell out of fashion for men by the 1740s. The tight-fitting breeches that suggested better tailoring and accentuated the strength of the male figure, particularly the legs, were replaced by pantaloons. Stockings and expensive wigs and fabrics were also abandoned.

He won five of his six races, including the Doncaster Gold Cup in 1828. After retiring from racing he became a successful stallion, siring St. Leger winner Charles the Twelfth and Voltigeur, who won both The Derby and the St. Leger. He was bred and owned by Robert Stephenson, before being sold to William Vane, Marquess of Cleveland, whom he raced for as a three-year-old. Background Voltaire was a brown colt bred by Robert Stephenson and foaled in 1826. He was sired by Blacklock, who won seventeen races including three Great Subscription Purses. Blacklock was also a successful stallion and was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1829. Amongst his other progeny were York St. Leger winner Velocipede and Doncaster Gold Cup winner Laurel. Voltaire was the fifth foal of his dam, an unnamed daughter of Epsom Derby winner Phantom. Racing career =1828: Two-year-old season= Voltaire made his debut on 9 April 1828 at Catterick Bridge, when he beat four rivals to win the Richmond Club Stakes. His only other start as a two-year-old came in July in the Tyro Stakes at Newcastle, where he faced five opponents. Starting as the 6/4 favourite and ridden by Sim Templeman, he won the race from Zodiac. During the winter he was amongst the favourites for the 1829 St. Leger Stakes. =1829: Three-year-old season= Voltaire's first race as a three-year-old was The Shorts, a Sweepstakes of 50 sovereigns each over one mile at York. He started at the 1/2 favourite and ridden by J. Day, he won the race from Penhill, with Elastic finishing in third place. He was one on nineteen horses to contest the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster in August. Rowton started the race as the favourite, with Frederick and Voltaire next at 4/1. Ridden by William Scott, Rowton took the lead a long way from the finish. Voltaire closed on the leader, but was still some distance behind as they entered the final furlong. Voltaire steadily closed on Rowton, who was being hard ridden, but could only finish second, a neck behind Rowton. Sir Hercules was third, with Felt finishing in fourth. Two days later Voltaire walked over for the Gascoigne Stakes, ran over the same course and distance as the St. Leger. Later in the day had his final race in the Doncaster Gold Cup, ran over two miles and five furlongs. Voltaire and the previous year's winner Laurel started the race at similar prices in the betting. Granby led the field at the start, until he was overtaken by Laurel, who was closely followed by Voltaire. The two raced together until Voltaire was asked to quicken by jockey Thomas Lye, when he pulled out a slight lead and won easily by half a length. Laurel finished the race in second place and Fleur de Lis in third. Voltaire was kept in training as a four-year-old, but never raced. This was due to a leg injury he sustained in the Gold Cup. Stud career Voltaire's son Voltigeur In 1832 Voltaire stood as a stallion at Boroughbridge in Yorkshire for a fee of 10 sovereigns. By 1841 he was standing at an increased fee of 16 guineas. His most notable progeny were: * Charles the Twelfth (1836) - won the St. Leger and two Goodwood Cups. He didn't have much success as a sire, but did produce Grand National winner Little Charley. * Lollypop (1836) - was the dam of Doncaster Cup winner Sweetmeat. * Vivandiere (1838) - won the Yorkshire Oaks and foaled Cantine, who won the Coronation Stakes and Nassau Stakes. * Yorkshire Lady (1839) - won the Stewards' Cup. * Merope (1841) - finished second in both the 1000 Guineas and Oaks in 1844. She was the dam of Flying Duchess who foaled Derby winner and important sire Galopin. * Prussic Acid (1843) - won the Trial Stakes. * Voltigeur (1847) - won The Derby, St. Leger and Doncaster Cup in 1850. As a sire he produced 2000 Guineas winner Vedette and two Ascot Gold Cup winners in Buckstone and Skirmisher. Voltaire died on 16 April 1848 at Hart in County Durham. Voltigeur's son Vedette sired Galopin (Voltaire therefore appearing twice in the third generation of his pedigree), who sired the undefeated St. Simon. It is mainly through St. Simon that Voltaire's sire line survives today. Pedigree Note: b. = Bay, br. = Brown, ch. = Chestnut * Voltaire was inbred 4x4 to King Fergus. This means that the stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

It is augmented by a parallel, collocated Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) \\"associate\\" wing, the 315th Airlift Wing (315 AW), which shares the same C-17 aircraft with the 437 AW. In addition, the USAF Auxiliary Civil Air Patrol Coastal Charleston Composite Squadron is also assigned to JB Charleston. They meet at the Aero Club near the control tower. On 8 January 2010, the 628th Air Base Wing started its Initial Operating Capability (IOC). The 628th Air Base Wing's primary duties are to provide unsurpassed installation support to 53 DoD and Federal agencies, servicing a total force of over 79,000 Airmen, Sailors, Soldiers, Marines, Coast Guardsmen, civilians, dependents and retirees on Charleston Air Force Base and Naval Weapons Station Charleston. They maintain $2B worth of physical infrastructure across 23 thousand non-contiguous acres. Additionally, they also provide mission-ready expeditionary Airmen to combatant commanders in support of joint and combined operations. The 628th Air Base Wing is set to go Fully Operationally Capable (FOC) on 1 October 2010 with an event taking place at Marrington Plantation at the Naval Weapons Station. Since the IOC phase, personnel on the Naval Weapons Station and the Air Force Base have been working vigrously to make Joint Base Charleston a success. Current work The Support Activity has expanded its mission and Department of Defense support role with over 40 tenant commands, and today is a training center, with the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command (NNPTC), Nuclear Power Training Unit, Propulsion Facility, and Border Patrol satellite academy; Naval Consolidated Brig, Charleston; Mobile Mine Assembly Unit; Explosive Ordnance Detachments; Marine Corps Reserve Center; an engineering complex, with the Naval Information Warfare Center Atlantic (NIWC, this is the largest employer in the Charleston area) and is close to the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast; 269 above-ground ammunition magazines, maintenance and storage of military ordnance including mines, and serves as an Army logistics hub, the busiest continental United States surface port in the defense transportation system. In addition, NWS Charleston contains more than 1,800 on-base houses for Navy enlisted and officer dependents as well as Coast Guard dependents, and has a child care facility, elementary and middle schools.

It is headquartered at Borisov and is commanded by Major General Alexander Volfovich. The command includes a mechanized brigade and a mixed artillery brigade. It was formed in 2001 from the 65th Army Corps. The command traces its lineage to the 65th Army of the Red Army, a field army of the Soviet Union during World War II. It was formed in October 1942 from rebuilding elements of the first formation of the 4th Tank Army on the Don Front. The army was commanded by Pavel Batov until after the fall of Berlin, and served in various Fronts commanded by Konstantin Rokossovsky for the duration of the war. Postwar, the 65th Army was moved to the Belorussian Military District, where it became the 7th Mechanized Army. In 1957 it became the 7th Tank Army. With the Dissolution of the Soviet Union the army became part of the Belarus Ground Forces and was downsized into the 7th Army Corps in 1993. A year later it was renamed the 65th Army Corps.  History  =Creation and Initial Operations of the 65th Army = Postwar photo of Colonel-General Pavel Ivanovich Batov4th Tank Army, under command of Maj. Gen. Vasily Kryuchenkin, launched numerous counterattacks against the German corridor to Stalingrad from August to October, 1942, until it was severely depleted in strength. (It was derisively known for a time as the \\"four-tank army\\" due to the few vehicles still operational.)David Glantz, \\"Pavel Ivanovich Batov\\", in Stalin's Generals, (Harold Shukman, Ed.), Phoenix Press, 2001, p. 39 Pavel Batov, who had previously commanded the 51st Army and the 3rd Army, assumed command on October 22 1942, a command he would hold until the end of the War. He had orders to rebuild these forces as a combined-arms army, the 65th Army, as part of Rokossovsky's new Don Front. This was accomplished by mid-November, and at this time the army consisted of: * 3 Guards Rifle Divisions (4th, 27th, 40th) * 6 Rifle Divisions (23rd, 24th, 252nd, 258th, 304th, 321st) * 2 Separate Tank Brigades (91st, 121st) * 3 Army Artillery Regiments, 1 Howitzer Regiment, 5 Guards Mortar Regiments, and supporting units.Nafziger collection file 942RKAA , pp 9 ‚Äì 10 65th Army played a leading role in Operation Uranus, the encirclement of the German forces at Stalingrad. Attacking out of the Kremenskaya bridgehead on the south bank of the Don. Rokossovsky later wrote in reference to Batov and his army: In the lead up to Operation Ring the 65th mounted an attack by two rifle divisions against the positions of the German 44th Infantry Division on January 7, 1943. This attack penetrated the German defensive line and inflicted severe casualties. A counterattack by German armor contained the Soviet advance, but did not regain the original line, consumed scarce fuel and ammunition, and exposed the vehicles to concentrated artillery fire, leading to losses.Robert A. Forczyk, Tank Warfare on the Eastern Front 1943-1945, Pen & Sword Books Ltd., Barnsley, UK, 2016, pp. 44-45 When Ring kicked off at 0805 hours on January 10, 65th Army was backed by a 55 minute artillery barrage from over 500 guns and howitzers and 450 rocket launchers on an attack front of 12km, the highest density of Soviet artillery achieved to that point of the war. This was followed by air attacks from the 16th Air Army against positions to the rear of the main German line. About 0900 hours, shock groups of five rifle divisions of the Army, supported by the 91st Tank Brigade and six Guards heavy tank regiments (60-70 KV tanks and 21 Churchill Mark IV tanks). The front of the 44th Division was smashed quite quickly and four depleted battalions were overrun.Forczyk, p. 45 =Redeployment to Central Front= Following the German surrender at Stalingrad, Rokossovsky's forces were redeployed northwest to become the new Central Front in the region around Kursk. 65th Army exploited a gap between the weak Second German Army and the Second Panzer Army, but was brought to a halt by the spring rasputitsa, German reserves released by their evacuation of the Rzhev Salient, and the German counter- offensive to the south of Kursk. 65th Army then dug in during the three-month lull in operations, towards the northwestern sector of the Kursk salient. At this time the order of battle of the 65th Army was as follows: * 18th Rifle Corps (69th, 149th and 246th Rifle Divisions) * 27th Rifle Corps (60th and 193rd Rifle Divisions and 115th Rifle Brigade) * 37th Guards, 181st, 194th and 354th Rifle Divisions * 4 Separate Tank Regiments, 2 Antitank Regiments, 2 Mortar Regiments, 2 Guards Mortar Regiments, and other support units Army strength: 100,000, 1,837 guns and mortars, 124 tanks and self-propelled guns.Nafziger collection file 943RGAB, pp 21 ‚Äì 22 Due to its position in the western sector of the salient, the 65th emerged mostly unscathed from the Battle of Kursk, and was well equipped to exploit the German defeat. In late July and August the Army joined in the pursuit of German forces to the Dnepr River. On 15 Oct., with divisional and army artillery firing 1,000 shells per minute in support, the 193rd Rifle Division forced a crossing of the Dnepr.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, 1996, p 75. From this point on, the 65th Army began earning a well-deserved reputation for its abilities in river-crossing and bridgehead operations.Glantz, p 40 =Operation Bagration= Rokossovsky's command was renamed 1st Belorussian Front, and in June, 1944, 65th Army took part in major strategic operations in Belorussia. The Army's order of battle at this time was as follows: * 18th Rifle Corps (37th Guards, 44th Guards and 69th Rifle Divisions) * 105th Rifle Corps (75th Guards, 193rd and 354th Rifle Divisions) * 15th and 356th Rifle Divisions, and 115th Rifle Brigade * 1st Guards Tank Corps (15th, 16th, 17th Guards Tank Brigades, and 1st Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade) * 1 Separate Tank Regiment and 4 Separate Self-propelled Artillery Regiments, and other support units.Nafziger collection file 944RFAF , pp 31 ‚Äì 33 In a well-known confrontation at the planning stage, Rokossovski convinced Stalin that, given the terrain, it was better to strike two strong blows against the German forces than just one.Earl F. Ziemke, The Soviet Juggernaut, Time-Life Books, Chicago, 1980, pp 127 ‚Äì 29 He was counting on Batov's ability to lead his Army across swampy regions south of Bobruisk, using corduroy roads, swamp shoes, and other means. 65th Army did not disappoint, and within a few days the German Ninth Army was encircled and mostly destroyed. For his performance, Batov was promoted to Colonel General.Glantz, p 41 65th Army crossed the Bug River on July 22, and pushed on to cross the Narev River, north of Warsaw, by Sept. 4. Operation Bagration had run out of steam, but Batov's army held off strong German counterattacks against the Narev bridgehead for more than two months. Following this, Rokossovski was reassigned to command of 2nd Belorussian Front. A shift in Front boundaries accompanied this, and 65th and 70th Armies became part of his new command. In the following months forces were built up in the Narev bridgehead for an offensive to be launched in January. =Into Germany= During the new offensive, 65th Army forced a crossing of the Vistula River in early February. Rokossovski later noted: In March, 1945, the order of battle of 65th Army was as follows: * 18th Rifle Corps (16th and 69th Rifle Divisions) * 46th Rifle Corps (108th, 186th and 413th Rifle Divisions) * 105th Rifle Corps (44th Guards, 193rd, and 354th Rifle Divisions) * 1 Separate Tank Regiment and 1 Separate Self-propelled Artillery Regiment, and other support units.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p 82 For the Danzig operation the army also had the 66th Guards SU Brigade attached, the Red Army's only heavy SU brigade, a potent force of 60 ISU-122 self-propelled guns.Sharp, \\"Red Hammers\\", Soviet Self-Propelled Artillery and Lend Lease Armor 1941 ‚Äì 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol.

Officials of the city surrendered to Colonel A. G. Frolenkov's 193rd Rifle Division on Apr. 26.Nikolai Litvin, 800 Days on the Eastern Front, University Press of Kansas, 2007, p 104 =Cold War= In April 1946, the 65th Army was reorganised as the 7th Mechanised Army at ≈Å√≥d≈∫. On 20 December, it became the 7th Tank Division (Mobilization), with its divisions becoming regiments. It was headquartered in Borisov from May 1948. On 21 March 1950, it was increased in strength to an army with its old designation. In 1955 the 7th Mechanized Army was equipped with the IS-3, T-54, T-34 and PT-76 tanks, as well as the ISU-122 self- propelled gun. In 1957, the 7th Mechanized Army was transformed into 7th Tank Army. * The 10th Tank Division was reformed in the 34th Tank Division * 15th Guards Mechanized Division was reformed in the 47th Guards Tank Division * 27th Guards Mechanized Division ‚Äì the 39th Guards Tank Division. In 1960, the 47th Guards Tank Division was renamed the 45th Guards Tank Division. In 1965, the 45th Guards Rivne Tank Division became a training tank formation subordinated to the Belorussian Military District, and the 39th Guards Tank Division was reorganized into the 37th Guards Rechitsa Tank Division. From 1960 to 1980, the basis of the 7th Tank Army was formed by the 3rd Guards Kotelnikovo, the 34th Dnieper, and the 37th Guards Rechitsa Tank Divisions. The formation actively participated in well-known large-scale exercises and maneuvers such as \\"Dnepr\\", \\"Neman\\", \\"Dvina\\", Exercise Zapad-81 and \\"Fall 88\\". By a Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on 15 January 1974, for good results in combat training, the 7th Tank Army was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. A USSR Ministry of Defense directive dated 25 January 1989 ordered the disbandment of the 3rd Guards Tank Division, effective from 1 June 1989. Instead, the 19th Guards Nikolaevsk-Budapest Tank Division was moved from the Southern Group of Forces in Hungary to Zaslonovo. On 7 November 1990 Tank Army had 764 T-62 and T-72 tanks, 208 infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers, as well as 212 guns, mortars and multiple rocket launchers. It also included the Scud-equipped 76th Rocket Brigade. =Service in the Belarus Ground Forces= After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus were created on the basis of the Belorussian Military District, including the 7th Tank Army. In 1993, the 7th Tank Army was renamed the 7th Army Corps, and in 1994 the 65th Army Corps. In December 2001, as a result of the reform of the Armed Forces of Belarus, the corps was transformed into the North-Western Operational Command (NWOC). Since then the troops and staff of the NWOC have participated in the exercises \\"Neman-2001\\", \\"Berezina-2002\\", \\"The Shield of the Fatherland ‚Äì 2004\\", \\"Shield of the Union ‚Äì 2006\\", \\"West-2009\\" and others. A joint operational exercise of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation, \\"Shield of the Union\\", was held in 2011. The exercise was held at the Ashuluk range in Astrakhan Oblast in the Russian Federation. The command participated in exercise \\"West-2011\\".

Mikuma (‰∏âÁÜäÂ±±) behind the city of Sumoto, Awaji island, he lived with his wife Omasu („ÅäÂ¢ó) and on moonlight nights with good weather, he drummed his belly. He performed mischief such as disguising himself as a human and making tree leaves seem like gold and sell them, but at the same time he did kind deeds such as guiding along humans who stumbled into the mountain while drunk, so nobody hated him. The people he has been kind to made offerings of 1 sho bottles of sake to where he dwelled. One time, Shibaemon heard that there was a very popular play called Nakaza that was being performed in Naniwa (now Osaka city) and disguised himself and Omasu both as humans to Osaka. The two became quite cheerful while sightseeing around Osaka, which they have never been to before, and had a contest of disguises. The Omasu disguised herself as one of the daimyo's procession and passed in front of Shibaemon. Next up was Shibaemon to disguise himself. In front of the Omasu, there proceeded a long procession of feudal lords. Omasu praised, \\"you're good, you're good\\" and was immediately cut down by one of the warriors in the procession. The procession was not Shibaemon, but the real thing. Shibaemon, who was stricken with grief, was about to return to Awaji, but decided to at least watch the play that Omasu wanted to see and used a technique to change tree leaves into gold and went to the theater. However, at the theater, there tree leaves were mixed in with the admission fees, so they suspected that a bake-danuki has slipped in among the guests and a guard dog was put on alert. When Shibaemon was finally about to go to the see the theater and then return to Awaji for the day, when Shibaemon came to the theater, there was a big dog. Shibamon hid his fear and passed through the entrance, but within a gap of his confidence, the dog rushed to attack. Shibaemon immediately returned to his appearance as a tanuki, was chased around by the people who brought the dog and finally hit in the head and killed. The rumor that a bake-danuki was killed in Osaka reached Awaji, and since they did not hear Shibaemon drum his belly, they understood that he was killed and the people severely hated the fact that he died. After Shibaemon's death, the people who came to see Nakaza decreased, and there was a rumor that \\"it was a curse from having killed Shibaemon,\\" so when the theater deified Shibaemon, the number of guests returned. Afterwards, Shibaemon, as a popular god, was deeply worshipped by many actors such as Nakamura Ganjirou, Kataoka Nizaemon, and Fujiyama Kanbi. Afterwards, in what was called Shibaemon's return home, the Shrine of Shibaemon was built in Sumoto due to Nizaemon, Kanbi, and others' donations.Ôºà„Ç§„É≥„Çø„Éº„Éç„ÉÉ„Éà„Éª„Ç¢„Éº„Ç´„Ç§„Éñ„Å´„Çà„ÇãË®òÈå≤Ôºâ Now, the Shrine of Shibaemon is near the castle ruins of Sumoto at the peak of Mt. Mikuma, and due to the legend of Shibaemon, who liked theater, there are many performers who visit the shrine even now.Â§öÁî∞Á∑®1997Âπ¥ 143-144È†Å„ÄÇ The Shibaemon Daimyoujin (Êü¥Âè≥Ë°õÈñÄÂ§ßÊòéÁ•û) that was deified in Nakaza also had a \\"return home\\" in the year 2000, and is now deified in the Sumoto Hachiman-jinja. Legend in the Tokushima prefecture In the Edo period, at the base of Mount Seimi (Âã¢Ë¶ãÂ±±) in Awa Province (now Tokushima prefecture), there was a theater business at the grounds of Kan'on-ji, and it earned great popularity. However, one night, the dogs that were supposed to perform merely barked at the guest seats, and did not perform at all. Finally, one of the dogs jumped towards the guest seats, rushed to attack a warrior and gnawed through his throat, bringing about his death. They thought that a big incident occurred, but when the government officials examined the remains of the warrior, the note in his pocket wrote that his name was \\"Tanshuu Sakiyama Shibaemon,\\" but there did not exist any such warrior by that name in Tanshuu. Furthermore, there were ten brushwood leaves in his pocket. The next morning, when the government officials visited to inspect again, the soldier's appearance turned into a bloodstained tanuki. It was Shibaemon-tanuki. At the same time, there was the great war between the two great tanuki forces in Awa, the Awa Tanuki Gassen, and both armies wanted reinforcements, it was rumored that Shibaemon visited Awa Island in order to lend power to one of the armies. Á´πÂéüÊò•Ê≥âÁîª„ÄéÁµµÊú¨ÁôæÁâ©Ë™û„Äè„Çà„Çä„ÄåËäùÂè≥Ë°õÈñÄÁã∏„Äç Ehon Hyaku Monogatari In the past, in Awaji, there was a peasant called Shibaemon, and an old tanuki came to him and requested for food scraps, and feeling pity, he expressly left some food for the tanuki. One day, Shibaemon amused the tanuki saying \\"try disguising yourself as a human\\" and the tanuki changed his appearance into that of a human around 50 years of age, and the tanuki came to visit Shibaemon day by day. Thus, he was informed about various legends and ancient events in great detail, and Shibaemon became greatly knowledgeable as a result, and was extravagantly praised by people. At that time, there was a business that came from Naniwa to visit Awaji to perform a play titled \\"Takeda Izumo,\\" so the tanuki disguised as an old man also went, but due to bad luck, was bitten by a dog on his way back and died. However, there was only an old tanuki, and even half a month after death his real identity did not show, and it only around the 24th and 25th of that month that the tanuki showed its true identity. True Identity There are theories that reality of the legend of Shibaemon-tanuki is that it was an excuse for the Kougo Jihen, a struggle that broke out between Sumoto and Awa, or that it was a Dutch person who washed ashore to Japan and hid himself in a castle, and was thought of by the people beneath the castle, who have never seen foreigners before, as a tanuki who disguised as a human, among other theories.

Stephens, mmn = Hughesp.14926 January 1959)GRO Register of Deaths:MAR 1959 5d 624 PANCRAS ‚Äì Lawrence G. Stephens, aged 35 was a BBC radio scriptwriter, best remembered for co-writing The Goon Show with Spike Milligan. Stephens was a regular writer of the show for the first two years, and then returned to The Goon Show to assist Milligan, during the latter's tougher moments. From his association with Milligan, Stephens became involved with Associated London Scripts (ALS), and was said to have been \\"one of the most eye-catching characters, in the earliest days of the company...he played a significant cameo role in the first phase of success for ALS\\". Stephens was born in West Bromwich and moved to Quinton when he was four. He attended Quinton Infant and Junior School then Birmingham Central Grammar School.https://www.expressandstar.com/entertainment/2020/04/06/tribute-to- writer-larry-stephens-who-shaped-modern-comedy/ Trained as an accountant, Stephens distinguished himself as a jazz pianist before the onset of World War II. Following service in the war, during which he served as a Commando captain, he returned to England, and began writing for British comedian Tony Hancock before Hancock became well known, and was Hancock's best man at the comedian's first wedding. In turn Hancock and his new wife Cicely were witnesses at Larry's marriage to Diana Forster a few days later. Both of the brides were models for the French fashion house Lanvin.The Life and Times of Larry Stephens - Finally Revealed, Mike Brown, The Missing Page (the magazine of the Tony Hancock Appreciation Society) Vol.2 Nos. 2 & 3, 2002 Milligan once remarked that \\"Larry and Tony were like brothers\\".McCann, (2006), p.150 Career In 1952, he developed a potential radio series for Hancock, which was designed to run for a full half-hour without musical breaks, then usual, called Vacant Lot. Although Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers and others were provisionally attached to the project, it was never recorded. Elements of Vacant Lot were later re-written by Stephens and broadcast by the BBC as Welcome to Welkham, but with Brian Reece, instead of Hancock. BBC Radio 4 Programme: \\"Larry Stephens, The Man Who Never Was\\" (originally aired 24 May 2007) The original script for Vacant Lot re-emerged in 2015. After its rediscovery in the BBC Archives by Stephens' biographer Julie Warren, Vacant Lot was finally premiered in November 2017 - 65 years after its planned broadcast. Staged by Birmingham Comedy Festival as a live 'script-in-hand' performance with actor and impressionist James Hurn (as Tony Hancock) and Janice Connolly among the cast, Stephens' \\"great writing\\" was noted. Stephens wrote for a number of popular shows, comedians and entertainers in the 1950s including Arthur Askey, Jon Pertwee and Dick Emery , Dickie Valentine , Kenneth Horne, Derek Roy, and Charles Hawtrey BBC Genome, Fables of the Fifties HORACE CLABTROUT AND THE BEANSTALK (1953), http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/abf02fdb14244d219e8eaff6fec6bf30.

He wrote for Hancock again on The Tony Hancock Show (1956‚Äì57), which was screened on ITV by Associated-Rediffusion. Stephens also wrote for other popular television series too, such as The Army Game with Maurice Wiltshire, with whom he also co-wrote three Goon Show episodes (later, Wiltshire also rewrote an unused Stephens script for the show). Several of his radio scripts for The Goon Show were later adapted by Wiltshire for the TV puppet version, The Telegoons. According to a BBC Radio 4 programme on Stephens' life, it was while working on the second season of The Goon Show that Stephens, doubling both as a key contributor and as Milligan's agent, began to drink so heavily it affected his work. McCann (2006) states that Stephens' partnership with Milligan \\"foundered initially in the early 1950s ‚Äì when he was drinking more than four bottles of rum and a couple of bottles of whisky each week\\".McCann, (2006), p.151 In February 1954, the BBC asserted that Stephens had violated the terms of his contract by failing to deliver scripts for The Goon Show on time, and that, thereafter, his work would only be considered on spec. Insulted, Stephens refused to have anything further to do with The Goon Show. Two years after the BBC cancelled his contract, Milligan managed to rehire Stephens for The Goon Show on the condition that Milligan, not the BBC, pay his salary. Per McCann (2006), Stephens was > Logical, perceptive and clever, he could capture Milligan's quick little > ideas before they shot straight out of sight and then place them into a > relatively coherent structure. His own keen visual sense ‚Äì he would even > illustrate his scripts with vivid little drawings of certain goons ‚Äì helped > sharpen some of Milligan's characterisations and stimulated his already rich > and lively imagination. Milligan would throw out all kinds of hit-or-miss > suggestions; Stephens would retrieve the ones most likely to work. Milligan > would sometimes get distracted or paralysed by all of the comic > possibilities; Stephens would often find the most effective way to get him > back on track and moving forwards.McCann, (2006), p.151 Stephens was probably at his busiest during 1955 and 1956, during which time, apart from co-writing The Goon Show, he also supplied the story and helped shape the screenplay for The Case of the Mukkinese Battle Horn (1956), and made countless last-minute re-writes of various comedians' scripts, innumerable gags for a wide range of variety shows and quite a few unofficial edits of troublesome television scripts.McCann, (2006), p.151 Stephens' heavy drinking had aggravated his high blood pressure, and he died on 26 January 1959; the official cause of death was a cerebral haemorrhage brought about by chronic hypertension. =Death= Stephens' death has been a subject of surmise and conjecture. Many Goon Show fans believe that Stephens died while having dinner with Milligan. Another theory, advanced by Humphrey Carpenter in his biography of Milligan, states that he died in a car while going out to dinner with his wife, Diana, and Milligan. McCann (2006) states that Stephens and his wife were on their way to dine out with Milligan.McCann, (2006), p.152. Note: McCann has the date of Stephens' death as 25 January 1959 It was most likely that Stephens' death was the reason that The Goon Show episode, \\"Dishonoured ‚Äì Again\\" (broadcast on 26 January 1959) was a remake of the show \\"Dishonoured\\" (broadcast on 14 December 1954).The Goon Show Depository forum A biography of Stephens has been written by his cousin Julie Warren.

Lake Par√≥n and the little Lake Chacra lie northwest of the mountain. The peak is accessible from the Pisco base camp at Cebollapampa. Climbing Chakrarahu is considered the steepest and the most difficult-to-climb six-thousander in the Andes. Although by no means worked out, the south face of the mountain has a quite staggering number of steep and difficult lines, enough to bear comparison with areas such as the south face of Mont Blanc du Tacul for maturity. The north side bore the brunt maturity of early development but still retains the greatest potential. A French expedition led by Lionel Terray first climbed the mountain on 31 July 1956 (Chakrarahu Oeste) and on 5 August 1962 (Chakrarahu Este) on what after have become the normal routes (northeast face and northeast ridge). Greg Mortimer was badly injured during a later attempt to climb the mountain. Some of the routes are amongst the most desperate of the Cordillera Blanca and probably of the entire Andes. All the routes take several days and involve hanging bivouacs. First ascents to the ridge linking the east and west summits are recorded. Not all the parties are able to reach the true summits of Chakrarahu Este and Oeste, because this requires traversing below the cornices and obviously increases the seriousness of the climbs.

The New York Times reported that, despite Cooney's weight (275 pounds), he was \\"agile on his feet, covering court well, and hit with a force that was baffling to [his opponent].\\" In the late 1920s, Cooney was the vice president of a New York lumber company (Cooney, Eckstein & Co., Inc.) while also running a professional dance orchestra at night, playing squash at the Yale Club and serving on its board of governors. The New York Times ran a story about Cooney's orchestra in 1927 in which Cooney noted that music had been his hobby all his life, playing the saxophone, mandolin, violin, and a few other instruments. He emphasized, however, that his band was not a jazz band: \\"We play rhythms but not jazz. That is, we save the melody.\\" In 1936, Cooney built the Waldo Theatre in Waldoboro, Maine.

He works at the Bishop Museum in Hawaii. Evenhuis has described over 500 species of insects since 1976, and is known both for his research and peculiar binomial names.  Education and career  Evenhuis was born in Southern California to parents who had immigrated to California from the Netherlands in 1938. In 1974, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Botany and Entomology from California State Polytechnic University in Pomona. In 1976, he started working as a scientific illustrator at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum. Two years later, he graduated with a Master's degree in Biology. Within a few years, he embarked on his own research by studying the taxonomy of Pacific flies. In 1988, he received a Ph.D. degree in Entomology at the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa and was soon promoted to full Entomologist. He has since described more than 500 new species of insects and authored more than 350 scientific publications, specializing in the families Bombyliidae and Mythicomyiidae. In 1992, he received the Thomas Say Award for his research by the Entomological Society of America. He is interested in the history of dipterology and nomenclature, and is a former president of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Evenhuis also campaigns for teaching school children to discern native species from alien species. = Taxonomy humor = In the entomological community, Evenhuis is also known for his sense of humor, and binomial names coined by him have attracted attention. After identifying a bombyliid from the genus Phthiria in 1985, he decided to name it Phthiria relativitae as a pun on theory of relativity. In order to ensure publication of the name in a scientific journal and thus its acceptance while avoiding criticism of English-speaking scientists, he had to submit it to a Polish journal. In 2002, he named a genus of extinct mythicomyiids Carmenelectra in honour of the model Carmen Electra's \\"splendid\\" body. The same year, he described Pieza kake, Pieza pi, Pieza rhea, and Pieza deresistans, as well as Reissa roni (named after Rice-A-Roni). In 2013, he named a new species of fly from French Polynesia as Campsicnemus popeye for its resemblance with the cartoon character Popeye in having swollen forearms.

Bloomberg. Headquartered in New York City, Bloomberg Philanthropies focuses its resources on five areas: the environment, public health, the arts, government innovation and education. According to the Foundation Center, Bloomberg Philanthropies was the 10th largest foundation in the United States in 2015, the last year for which data was available. Bloomberg has pledged to donate the majority of his wealth, currently estimated at more than $54 billion. Patti Harris is the CEO of Bloomberg Philanthropies. History While working at Bloomberg L.P., Bloomberg donated much of his wealth to medical research, education and the arts. He also sat on the boards of numerous charitable organizations. Beginning in 2004, Bloomberg appeared on Chronicle of Philanthropy‚Äôs list of top 50 Americans who had donated the most money that year. Between 2004 and 2011, Bloomberg was listed as a top 10 American philanthropist each year. Since 2006, the headquarters has been located at Stuyvesant Fish House on East 78th Street in Manhattan. Initiatives Bloomberg Philanthropies directs its resources to five issue areas: the environment, public health, the arts, government innovation and education. =Environment= Bloomberg Philanthropies has focused on combating climate change and moving toward clean energy sources. In 2011, the foundation partnered with the Sierra Club‚Äôs Beyond Coal campaign by donating $50 million toward shutting down coal-fired power plants. On April 8, 2015, Bloomberg Philanthropies increased its support of the Beyond Coal campaign with a $30 million pledge, in order to accelerate the goal of closing and replacing half of all U.S. coal power plants with clean energy by 2017. Bloomberg Philanthropies partnered with RadicalMedia to produce the 2017 documentary \\"From the Ashes.\\" the film was distributed by National Geographic and debuted at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival. The film appeared in theaters and aired on National Geographic in summer 2017. In conjunction with the film, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced a new commitment and crowdfunding campaign to support \\"entities backing economic development in communities that are historically dependent on the coal industry, and have suffered as plants have closed.\\" Bloomberg Philanthropies also partners with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, where Bloomberg is the former chairman, to curb carbon emissions in major cities around the world. In 2012, Bloomberg Philanthropies made a $6 million donation to the Environmental Defense Fund to help secure strong state-level regulations for hydraulic fracturing. Bloomberg has stated his support for \\"responsible\\" fracking as an alternative to coal power. In January 2014, Bloomberg Philanthropies committed $53 million to Vibrant Oceans Initiative over the course of five years to help reform fisheries and increase sustainable populations. In April 2014, Bloomberg Philanthropies invested $5 million in Little Sun, a solar-powered lamp company founded by artist Olafur Eliasson and entrepreneur Frederik Ottesen. In 2018, Bloomberg Philanthropies and OceanX, an initiative of the Dalio family, committed $185 million over a period of four years to protect the oceans. In May 2019, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced a 2020 Midwestern Collegiate Climate Summit in Washington University in St. Louis with the aim to bring together leaders from Midwestern universities, local government and the private sector to reduce climate impacts in the region. In October 2020, Bloomberg Philanthropies was announced as one of the alliance partners of Prince William's Earthshot Prize, to find solutions to environmental issues. =Public health= Led by epidemiologist Kelly J. Henning, the Bloomberg Philanthropies public health program has focused on reducing tobacco use through the MPOWER tobacco control strategy, making roads safer and eradicating polio, among other public health initiatives. In March 2012, the foundation donated $220 million to fight tobacco use over a four-year period. Following new commitments in December 2016, Bloomberg Philanthropies reached a total of $1 billion in its campaign to reduce tobacco use, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In 2009, Bloomberg Philanthropies partnered with the World Health Organization to donate $125 million to reduce traffic-related fatalities, and in 2014, it committed an additional $125 million to combat road traffic deaths in low- and middle-income cities. In March 2013, Bloomberg Philanthropies donated $100 million to help the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation eradicate polio worldwide. Bloomberg Philanthropies has also supported initiatives to improve women's health. In July 2012, the foundation committed $50 million to the Global Family Planning Initiative, a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation program focused on providing obstetric care and contraceptives to women in developing countries. This contribution came after Bloomberg pledged $250,000 to support Planned Parenthood in February 2012. In October 2012, the foundation also donated $8 million to the Bloomberg Philanthropies Maternal Health Program, which focuses on reducing maternal deaths in Tanzania. In March 2014, Bloomberg Philanthropies expanded its work in Tanzania and to provide reproductive health services in Africa and Latin America. Beginning in 2012, Bloomberg Philanthropies pledged $16.5 million toward the Obesity Prevention Program, a three-year effort to support public health policies aimed at reducing obesity in Mexico, which has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world. With support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, Mexican health leaders and activists mounted a national health campaign against soda consumption and successfully lobbied for the passage of a national sugar-sweetened beverage tax. In 2014 - the first year of the tax - purchases of sugary drinks in Mexico dropped by up to 12%. In January 2014, the Obesity Prevention Program and other health advocates in Mexico successfully lobbied for the passage of an 8% tax on high calorie snacks, which was intended to work in tandem with the 2014 soda tax to reduce unhealthy food purchases nationwide. In June 2015, a study by researchers at Mexico's National Institute of Public Health and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill showed a corresponding average reduction of 5.1% in purchases of all food items subject to the junk food tax. Following the tax's implementation, lower-income households in Mexico purchased 10.2% less junk food, while medium-income households bought 5.8% less overall. On March 23, 2015, Bloomberg Philanthropies launched the four-year, $100 million Data for Health initiative in partnership with the Australian government. The initiative's stated goal is to help 20 low and middle-income countries improve public health data collection and more effectively address public health problems. On June 21, 2016, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced the official launch of health partnerships with the first 18 participant countries, which include China, India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil, Ecuador, Malawi, Morocco, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Rwanda, Solomon Islands, Tanzania, and Zambia. =Arts= Bloomberg Philanthropies‚Äô focus on the arts includes a $32 million commitment in 2011 to funding arts organizations and initiatives throughout New York City as well as provide business management training. Bloomberg Philanthropies invited 250 small and midsize arts organizations to apply for the $32 million disbursal. In September 2011, Bloomberg Philanthropies joined several foundations to contribute a total of $11.5 million to ArtPlace, a nationwide art funding initiative led by the National Endowment for the Arts that aims to use the arts as a strategy for economic development. In June 2013, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced a $15 million grant to five institutions ‚Äî Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the New York Botanical Garden, and Guggenheim Museum ‚Äî as part of the Bloomberg Arts Engagement Initiative to develop mobile applications for visitors. In September 2014, Bloomberg Philanthropies committed $17 million to increase the use of digital technology at six cultural institutions ‚Äì The Brooklyn Museum, American Museum of Natural History, Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Science Museum in London, and Gardens by the Bay in Singapore ‚Äì and rebranded the program as Bloomberg Connects. The foundation has committed a total of $83 million to cultural institutions around the world. In October 2014, Bloomberg Philanthropies launched the Public Art Challenge, a competition that invited local leaders and arts organizations to collaborate on temporary public art projects that would celebrate creativity and drive economic development. On June 23, 2015, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced four winning projects, selected from 237 nationwide submissions. The winning proposals came from Gary, Indiana; Los Angeles, CA; Spartanburg, SC; and a joint effort between Albany, Schenectady, and Troy, NY. Each winning proposal received $1 million to support the proposed public art installation over the following two years. From July 16 to August 14, 2016, the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs hosted Current: LA Water, a citywide public art biennial supported by a $1 million grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies‚Äô Public Art Challenge initiative. Local artists created public art pieces across 16 different locations to remind LA residents of the city's important relationship with water, in the face of record-setting drought and the ongoing work to revitalize the Los Angeles River. Speaking to the United States Conference of Mayors in May 2017, Bloomberg Philanthropies founder Michael Bloomberg announced the creation of the Partnership for Health Cities initiative which offers cities technical support to improve the health of residents. By July, fifty cities were participating in the program. =Government innovation= Bloomberg Philanthropies supports efforts to make city government more efficient and innovative. In January 2013, a $16.2 million grant was awarded to five different cities to establish Financial Empowerment Centers, which were set up to provide free financial counseling for low-income individuals. Five U.S. cities split a $24 million Bloomberg Philanthropies grant to create ‚ÄúInnovation Delivery Teams‚Äù ‚Äì teams working to streamline municipal government. In August 2014, Bloomberg Philanthropies invested $45 million for grants to implement Innovation Delivery Teams in city governments across the United States. In March 2013, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced Providence, R.I. as the winner of the Mayors Challenge, an initiative intended to foster innovation in America's cities. Providence was awarded $5 million for proposing a plan to overcome a language skills deficit prominent in low-income children. Houston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Santa Monica each were awarded $1 million. In September 2014, Barcelona was announced as the winner of the European Mayors Challenge, and the city was awarded ‚Ç¨5 million to help improve the quality of life for elderly residents. Athens, Kirklees, United Kingdom, Stockholm, and Warsaw were awarded ‚Ç¨1 million each. On January 20, 2016, Bloomberg Philanthropies launched the 2016 Mayors Challenge, calling for Latin American and Caribbean cities to submit government innovation proposals that improve residents‚Äô lives and make government work better. In November, Mike Bloomberg announced that S√£o Paulo, Brazil had won the $5 million grand prize for a project that helped farmers connect to urban markets. Four other cities received $1 million each in the challenge: Medell√≠n and Bogot√° in Colombia, as well as Santiago, Chile and Guadalajara, Mexico. Almost a third of the major cities in the region competed in the 2016 Mayors Challenge. The next round of the innovation contest ‚Äî focusing on American cities ‚Äî was announced in June 2017. In April 2015, Bloomberg Philanthropies launched What Works Cities, a $42 million national initiative to help 100 mid-sized American cities better use data and evidence to improve government effectiveness and residents' lives. As of March 2016, 27 U.S. cities were official participants in the program. =Education= Bloomberg Philanthropies focuses on driving public policy initiatives and education leadership at a local level as a means to improving America's school system. To date, the organization's education giving has been split between charitable, legislative and political initiatives. In October 2014, Bloomberg Philanthropies launched a $10 million program to help top-performing students from low- and middle-income families apply to and graduate from the nation's top colleges. By December 2016, it pledged to give $1.7 million to the American Talent Initiative, a program run by the College Excellence Program at the Aspen Institute and Ithaka S+R, a consulting subsidiary of Ithaka Harbors. Other philanthropic ventures Bloomberg has been a longtime donor to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University. In January 2013, he donated $350 million to the university, the largest single gift in the school's history. In total, Bloomberg has donated $1.1 billion to Johns Hopkins, making him the most generous living donor to any education institution in the country. In April 2001, the School of Hygiene and Public Health was renamed as the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In May 2012, the Charlotte R. Bloomberg Children's Center opened inside the new Johns Hopkins Hospital, with a focus on pediatric care. =Women's economic development= Since 2008 Bloomberg Philanthropies has worked with nonprofit advocacy organizations including Women for Women International and Sustainable Harvest to create economic opportunities for women in Sub-Saharan Africa. Supported initiatives include job training, civic and life skills education, entrepreneurship programs, and a philanthropic data-sharing portal created with the Foundation Center and the King Baudouin Center to help women in Rwanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Sudan, and Nigeria. While hosting the U.S.-Africa Business Forum on September 23, 2016, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced a $10 million grant to the Relationship Coffee Institute to support the expansion of its ongoing women's economic development initiatives in Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo. The renewed financial commitment will enable the institute to provide an additional 20,000 women in both countries with business training and connections to international coffee markets. On October 4, 2016, Marriott International opened its first hotel in Rwanda with a pledge to support women trained by the Relationship Coffee Institute and Women for Women International - both local partners of Bloomberg Philanthropies. The new hotel has employed 27 such trainees in hospitality positions and procured their artisanal baskets, coffee, cheese, and honey to provide to hotel guests. =Sciences= On October 18, 2016 Bloomberg revealed it is donating $50 million to the Museum of Science in Boston, the largest gift in the institution's 186-year history.

In May 1815 Gordon sent a letter, per Currie's request, to the government of the British colony at the Cape of Good Hope Colony, asking for British aid and protection. Eventually Britain annexed the island in 1816, establishing a small garrison there. Bengal Merchant was admitted to the Registry of Great Britain in 1814. A passenger travelling from Batavia to Dover in 1815 on Bengal Merchant remarked on her master's insistence on her crew attending divine service on Sunday. The passenger thought it ridiculous to read prayers in English to a crew of lascars, Chinese, and Malays who did not understand the language.

Charles Le Brun designed the centerpiece depicting the Greek god Apollo rising from the sea in a four-horse chariot. A pond was dug on the site of the fountain in 1639 called \\"The Pond of the Swans\\". When King Louis XIV had it enlarged in 1671, the pond's east-west orientation and the common association of the King with Apollo prompted Le Brun to suggest dedicating the site to Apollo. The dawn theme was popular at the time and appears on some painted ceilings in European palaces. The fountain was constructed between 1668 and 1671. In 2014, a same-scale replica was unveiled in Tainan, Taiwan, at the entrance of the Chimei Museum. The museum commissioned French artist Gills Perrault in 2008 to reproduce the Fountain of Apollo, same as the one in Palace of Versailles. It took three years for modern laser measuring and the plaster mold to be made in France for the reproduction sculpture, and another three years to carve the marbles in the city of Carrara, Italy.

The church was the first church in Rusk County, built just below the junction of the Chippewa and Flambeau Rivers in 1882 to serve the French and Indian community called Flambeau Farms.Fr. Robert M. Urban (1983). History of Rusk County Wisconsin. Dallas, Texas: Taylor Publishing Company. pp. 51‚Äì52. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. In the later 1800s, logging and log-driving made the Flambeau and Chippewa rivers a busy place. White settlement began around 1847 and by 1864 the Daniel Shaw Lumber Company had established a farm near the junction of the rivers to supply its logging operations. In addition to river traffic, the stagecoach line from Chippewa Falls into the logging frontier also stopped at Shaw's farm. A mile and a half to the east, a village of Chippewa Indians had taken root on the south bank of the river. Franciscan missionaries visited the village and around 1881 they built a simple mission church facing the river, with local carpenter Thomas Orthman and other residents working under the direction of Father Chrysostom Verwyst and Father Casimir. In back was a one-story priest's quarters. In 1884 a 2-story annex was added, intended as a monastery but never used for that purpose. The bell tower was added in 1903. The Chippewa community had about 70 confirmed members at the 1881 dedication of the church. This was around the peak of pine logging, and the Flambeau settlement had about 11 saloons. With the passing of logging, all of this has faded. The church is the only building surviving from the little logging community.

Career Fryer was born in Hampstead, London in 1877, the only son of three children. His father George Henry Fryer was an insurance broker. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood, then went on for two years study (1893‚Äì95) under Oscar Beringer at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM). In 1894, Fryer won the Heathcote Long Prize. This was followed by four years of study (1895‚Äì98) at the Royal College of Music (RCM), under Franklin Taylor. In 1898, Fryer had some lessons with Ferruccio Busoni in Weimar. He also studied with Tobias Matthay.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed. (London: Macmillan, 1954), vol. 3, p. 510: \\"Fryer, (George) Herbert\\". He made his London debut on 17 November 1898, and then commenced a career as a touring recitalist as well as an examiner for the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. These tours took him all over Britain and Europe, and also to many parts of Canada, the United States, Australia (including the goldfields of Western Australia) South Africa, the Far East, and India. He was also a competition adjudicator. He was said to have travelled more than any other British pianist. He gave 50 recitals in London alone, said to have been a record. The King of Norway attended his recital in Christiania. He played at the Proms on six occasions between 1901 and 1918, playing such works as Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24, Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3, Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 and Concert Fantasia, and Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 2. His knowledge of the Brahms concerto was informed by the fact that his teacher Oscar Beringer had given the British premiere of the work in 1882.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed. (1954), vol. 1, p. 644: \\"Beringer, Oscar\\". In 1905, he took up a teaching position at the RAM, where he continued until 1914. His first tour of North America came in 1914, and he stayed there for three years, teaching at the Institute of Musical Art in New York (later merged with the Juilliard School). On his return to Britain in 1917, he was appointed Professor of Piano at the Royal College of Music, remaining in that post for the next 30 years, until 1947. Fryer's list of pupils was impressive. They included Arthur Bliss, Lance Dossor, Colin Horsley, Constant Lambert, Cyril Smith and Kendall Taylor.Sir Arthur Bliss by John Sugden, Omnibus Press, 1998 On retirement, he continued teaching privately above Bl√ºthner's showrooms, and died in London in 1957, aged 79.

History  =St. Ann's Catholic Church and Cemetery= The community that built St. Anne's was chiefly German and German-Bohemian, mainly people who immigrated from around the border between Bohemia and Bavaria from 1881 to 1883. With Clergy first came to St. Anne's community by horseback or rail for services in homes.Walter L. Gojmerac. The Story Behind...Historic St. Ann's Church and Cemetery. Madison, Wisconsin: Author, 1996. In 1884 the Wisconsin Central Railroad donated a one-acre site for the church. In 1888, following approval of Bishop Kilian Caspar Flasch of the Diocese of La Crosse, construction of the church and adjacent cemetery began. Next to the church to the west was the Highland School, and in 1892 the Thums General Store and Post Office was built across the road. With that, this rural crossroads formed the center of a fairly self-contained community. The first Mass was offered at St. Anne's on September 25, 1888 by Rev. J. W. Ritz. When a rectory was built in 1902 at Rib Lake for St. John the Baptist Church, Rev. Joseph Heeger, that church's first resident pastor also served St. Ann's congregation. Services were conducted in German from the start until 1915. In 1905 administration of St. Anne's was transferred to the new Diocese of Superior. In 1908, a statue of Mary was donated by St. Ann's Altar Society. The cemetery immediately behind the church contains graves dating to 1887, including founders of the church. Two of the graves are marked by ornate iron crosses in a style which the old-timers knew from their home in \\"old country.\\" The church was wired for electricity in 1933, using light fixtures that had come from Medford State Bank, but electric power didn't become available until 1946. During the 1940s a new oil burning furnace was installed. In 1963, the diocese closed St. Ann's Church because of a shortage of clergy. After closing, the diocese maintained insurance coverage, but routine maintenance and upkeep declined. In 1983, parishioners were presented with several options, two of which involved demolition. They chose to form a non-profit organization responsible for care and maintenance of the building and grounds. = Historic St. Ann's = Local preservationists and former parish members purchased the church and cemetery from the Diocese of Superior and formed Historic St. Ann's Inc.. Articles of incorporation were filed on August 12, 1988. Over the years, through annual work bees, members have enhanced the building, grounds and cemetery property.

Dutchsubmarines.com :: O 14 =During World War II= During the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, O 14 was stationed in Cura√ßao with sister ship , where both were receiving maintenance. Consultations between the Dutch and British Navy resulted in the decision to move O 14 and O 15 to Europe, since there was no need for Dutch submarines in the Caribbean. Both ships went via Kingston, Bermuda, and Halifax to England. O 14 underwent repairs at Halifax Shipyard on its armament. Since there was a lack of distilled water for the ship's batteries, O 14 could not join Convoy HX 78, but had to wait until October 1940, for Convoy HX 79. On 19 October a German wolfpack attacked the convoy, which sank 12 of the 45 ships and damaged another. O 14 was attacked as well, but all three torpedoes fired at the ship missed their target. On 22 October 1940, O 14 arrived in Rothesay, Bute, and with and was used as a target ship during tests with the ASDIC sonar system. From 22 December 1940, O 14 was stationed in Dundee, where maintenance was done and the batteries replaced. Until August 1941 O 14 again served as the target ship for ASDIC tests in Scapa Flow. From 8 August 1940, to January 1941, O 14 patrolled the coast of Norway without being able to attack any enemy ships. In January 1942 O 14 participated in Operation Kitbag, where it was placed off the Norwegian coast and used as a radio beacon for destroyers on their way to the fjord at Hell, Norway. At the end of January and the start of February O 14 was involved with the unsuccessful search for the German battleship . Afterward O 14 was used as a target ship for anti-submarine warfare exercises in Scapa Flow, and then did three more patrols off the Norwegian coast, again without attacking enemy ships. After those last patrols there was trouble with the diesel engines. Given the lack of parts, the severity of the problems, and the age of O 14 it was decided to decommission the sub. Parts were used in the repair of sister ship O 15. The Dutch crew was then stationed on a sub loaned from the British Navy, , which was renamed Zeehond.

National syndicalism developed in France, and then spread to Italy, Spain, and Portugal.  France  French national syndicalism was an adaptation of Georges Sorel's version of revolutionary syndicalism to the monarchist ideology of integral nationalism, as practised by Action Fran√ßaise. Action Fran√ßaise was a French nationalist-monarchist movement led by Charles Maurras. = Background (1900‚Äì1908) = In 1900, Charles Maurras declared in Action Fran√ßaise's newspaper that anti-democratic socialism is the \\"pure\\" \\"a socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element fits nationalism as a well-made glove fits a beautiful hand\\" (italics in original). Published in L'Action fran√ßaise, page 863, 15 November 1900. Quoted in For a detailed study of this quote, see: : : and correct form of socialism. From then on, he and other members of Action Fran√ßaise (like Jacques Bainville, Jean Rivain, and Georges Valois) interested in Sorel's thought discussed the similarity between the movements in Action Fran√ßaise's conferences and in essays published in the movement's newspaper, hoping to form a collaboration with revolutionary syndicalists. Such collaboration was formed in 1908 with a group of labor unions' leaders led by √âmile Janvion. As a result of this collaboration, Janvion founded the anti-republican journal Terre libre. = Beginning (1909) = The collaboration between the integral nationalism of Action Fran√ßaise and the revolutionary syndicalism of Georges Sorel began in 1909. The connection was formed after Sorel read the second edition of Maurras' book, Enqu√™te sur la monarchie. Maurras favorably mentioned Sorel and revolutionary syndicalism in the book, and even sent a copy of the new edition to Sorel. Sorel read the book, and in April 1909 wrote a praising letter to Maurras. Three months later, on 10 July, Sorel published in Il Divenire sociale (the leading journal of Italian revolutionary syndicalism) an essay admiring Maurras and Action Fran√ßaise. Sorel based his support on his anti-democratic thought. For example, he claimed that Action Fran√ßaise was the only force capable to fight against democracy. \\"A vigorous protest had to be made against this spirit of decadence: no other group except Action fran√ßaise was able to fulfill a role requiring both literacy and faith. The friends of Maurras form an audacious avant-garde engaged in a fight to the finish against the boors who have corrupted everything they have touched in our country. The merit of these young people will appear great in history, for we may hope that due to them the reign of stupidity will come to an end some day near at hand\\". Originally published in Quoted in Action Fran√ßaise reprinted the essay in its newspaper on 22 August, titled \\"Anti-parliamentary Socialists\\". = La cit√© fran√ßaise and L'Ind√©pendance (1910‚Äì1913) = In 1910 Sorel and Valois decided to create a national-socialist journal called La cit√© fran√ßaise. A prospectus for the new journal was published in July 1910, signed by both revolutionary syndicalists (Georges Sorel and √âdouard Berth) and Action Fran√ßaise members (Jean Variot, Pierre Gilbert and Georges Valois). La cit√© fran√ßaise never got off the ground because of Georges Valois's animosity toward Jean Variot. After the failure of La cit√© fran√ßaise, Sorel decided to found his own journal. Sorel's biweekly review, called L'Ind√©pendance, was published from March 1911 to July 1913. Its themes were the same as the journal of Action Fran√ßaise, such as nationalism, antisemitism, and a desire to defend the French culture and heritage of ancient Greece and Rome. = Cercle Proudhon = During the preparations for launching La Cit√© fran√ßaise, Sorel encouraged Berth and Valois to work together. In March 1911, Henri Lagrange (a member of Action Fran√ßaise) suggested to Valois that they found an economic and social study group for nationalists. Valois persuaded Lagrange to open the group to non-nationalists who were anti-democratic and syndicalists. Valois wrote later that the aim of the group was to provide \\"a common platform for nationalists and leftist anti-democrats\\".Quoted in The new political group, called Cercle Proudhon, was founded on 16 December 1911. It included Berth, Valois, Lagrange, the syndicalist Albert Vincent and the royalists Gilbert Maire, Ren√© de Marans, Andr√© Pascalon, and Marius Riquier. As the name Cercle Proudhon suggests, the group was inspired by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. It was also inspired by Georges Sorel and Charles Maurras. In January 1912 the journal of Cercle Proudhon was first published, entitled Cahiers du cercle Proudhon.  Italy  In the early 20th century, nationalists and syndicalists were increasingly influencing each other in Italy.Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri, The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 161 From 1902 to 1910, a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists including Arturo Labriola, Agostino Lanzillo, Angelo Oliviero Olivetti, Alceste De Ambris, Filippo Corridoni and Sergio Panunzio sought to unify the Italian nationalist cause with the syndicalist cause and had entered into contact with Italian nationalist figures such as Enrico Corradini.Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri. The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994. pp. 31-32 These Italian national syndicalists held a common set of principles: the rejection of bourgeois values, democracy, liberalism, Marxism, internationalism, and pacifism while promoting heroism, vitalism, and violence.Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri. The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 32 Not all Italian revolutionary syndicalists joined the Fascist cause, but most syndicalist leaders eventually embraced nationalism and \\"were among the founders of the Fascist movement,\\" where \\"many even held key posts\\" in Mussolini's regime.Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri. The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33 Benito Mussolini declared in 1909 that he had converted over to revolutionary syndicalism by 1904 during a general strike.Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri, The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33 Enrico Corradini promoted a form of national syndicalism that utilized Maurassian nationalism alongside the syndicalism of Georges Sorel.Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri. The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 163 Corradini spoke of the need for a national syndicalist movement that would be able to solve Italy's problems, led by elitist aristocrats and anti-democrats who shared a revolutionary syndicalist commitment to direct action through a willingness to fight. Corradini spoke of Italy as being a \\"proletarian nation\\" that needed to pursue imperialism in order to challenge the \\"plutocratic\\" nations of France and the United Kingdom.Martin Blinkhorn. Mussolini and fascist Italy. Second edition. New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2003 Pp. 9. Corradini's views were part of a wider set of perceptions within the right-wing Italian Nationalist Association (ANI) that claimed that Italy's economic backwardness was caused by corruption within its political class, liberalism, and division caused by \\"ignoble socialism\\". The ANI held ties and influence amongst conservatives, Catholics, and the business community. A number of Italian fascist leaders began to relabel national syndicalism as Fascist syndicalism. Mussolini was one of the first to disseminate this term, explaining that \\"Fascist syndicalism is national and productivistic‚Ä¶ in a national society in which labor becomes a joy, an object of pride and a title to nobility.\\"A.

Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of North Carolina Press, 1979, p. 290 Rossoni was dismissed from his post in 1928, which could have been due to his powerful leadership position in the Fascist unions,Franklin Hugh Adler, Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The Political Development of the Industrial Bourgeoisie, 1906-1934, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 391 and his hostilities to the business community, occasionally referring to industrialists as \\"vampires\\" and \\"profiteers\\".Lavoro d'Italia, January 6, 1926 With the outbreak of World War I, Sergio Panunzio noted the national solidarity within France and Germany that suddenly arose in response to the war and claimed that should Italy enter the war, the Italian nation would become united and would emerge from the war as a new nation in a \\"Fascio nazionale\\" (national union) that would be led by an aristocracy of warrior-producers that would unite Italians of all classes, factions, and regions into a disciplined socialism.Anthony James Gregor. Mussolini's intellectuals: fascist social and political thought. Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 2005. Pp. 78. In November 1918, Mussolini defined national syndicalism as a doctrine that would unite economic classes into a program of national development and growth.Anthony James Gregor. Mussolini's intellectuals: fascist social and political thought. Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 2005. Pp. 81.  Iberian Peninsula  National syndicalism in the Iberian Peninsula is a political theory very different from the fascist idea of corporatism, inspired by Integralism and the Action Fran√ßaise (for a French parallel, see Cercle Proudhon). It was formulated in Spain by Ramiro Ledesma Ramos in a manifesto published in his periodical La Conquista del Estado on 14 March 1931. National syndicalism was intended to win over the anarcho-syndicalist Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) to a corporatist nationalism. Ledesma's manifesto was discussed in the CNT congress of 1931. However, the National Syndicalist movement effectively emerged as a separate political tendency. Later the same year, Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista was formed, and subsequently voluntarily fused with Falange Espa√±ola. In 1936 Franco forced a further less voluntary merger with traditionalist Carlism, to create a single party on the Nationalist side of the Spanish Civil War. During the war, Falangists fought against the Second Spanish Republic, which had the armed support of CNT. It was one of the ideological bases of Francoist Spain, especially in the early years. The ideology was present in Portugal with the Movimento Nacional- Sindicalista (active in the early 1930s), its leader Francisco Rol√£o Preto being a collaborator of Falange ideologue Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera. The Spanish version theory has influenced the Kataeb Party in Lebanon, the National Radical Camp Falanga in Poland and various Falangist groups in Latin America. The Unidad Falangista Monta√±esa maintained a trade union wing, called the Association of National-Syndicalist Workers.

The program was a tribute to Muppet creator Jim Henson, who had died earlier in 1990 due to toxic shock syndrome caused by a streptococcus infection, and featured characters from The Muppet Show, Fraggle Rock, and Sesame Street. It marked Steve Whitmire's first onscreen performance as Kermit the Frog. Plot Kermit the Frog is away traveling, leaving Fozzie Bear and the other Muppets in charge of the week's production number. On the day of the show, the Muppets receive a letter from Kermit informing them the production number is meant to pay tribute to Jim Henson. However, the group is unfamiliar with who Henson is. The rest of the special depicts the Muppets figuring out Jim Henson's relation to them, while simultaneously creating the production number. Through the course of the special, interviews of several special guests are shown (including Carol Burnett, Ray Charles, John Denver, Steven Spielberg, Harry Belafonte and Frank Oz), where each guest recounts their personal experiences with Henson and his contributions to film, television, puppetry and philanthropy. As the Muppets are nearing the presentation of their tribute number, Fozzie discovers some of Jim Henson's fan mail. One letter addressed to Kermit initially starts out cheerfully, but then turns to sorrow when the letter reveals that Henson has since died. Shocked, the Muppets take turns reading different letters from fans. Finally, Fozzie decides to cancel the production number, deeming it improper for the occasion. Kermit's nephew Robin tries to convince Fozzie otherwise by breaking into \\"Just One Person\\" (which was composed for Snoopy: The Musical in 1975 and featured in the Bernadette Peters episode of The Muppet Show in 1977). Eventually the song becomes a large musical number with characters from Sesame Street and Fraggle Rock joining in. As the Muppets finish singing, Kermit arrives and congratulates the group on finding the proper way of honoring Henson. Kermit decides to enact Fozzie's original production number and addresses the audience, ensuring that the Muppets will continue to perform because \\"that's the way the boss would want it.\\" Cast * Harry Belafonte - himself * Carol Burnett - herself * Ray Charles - himself * John Denver - himself * Jim Henson - himself (archive footage) * Frank Oz - himself * Steven Spielberg - himself =Muppet performers= * Frank Oz - Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Bert and Animal * Jerry Nelson - Robin the Frog, Lew Zealand, Announcer, and Floyd Pepper * Richard Hunt - Scooter and Janice * Dave Goelz - Gonzo the Great, Beauregard and Zoot * Steve Whitmire - Rizzo the Rat, Bean Bunny, Kermit the Frog, and Whoopie Cushion * Kevin Clash - Clifford and Elmo * Kathryn Mullen - Joy Buzzer and Mokey Fraggle * Caroll Spinney - Big Bird * Pam Arciero - Grundgetta Additional Muppets performed by Camille Bonora, Fran Brill, Jim Martin, Joey Mazzarino, Peter MacKennan, Carmen Osbahr, Martin P.

He was nicknamed America's \\"Brand Name Painter\\" by TIME because of his impressionist paintings of America's most popular brands.  Early life  O‚ÄôConnell was born in New York City and raised in Tucker, Georgia. After graduating from Emory University in 1990 with degrees in philosophy and Spanish literature, he moved back home where he worked in a grocery store. He later moved to Paris to write a novel.  Career  Without formal art training, O‚ÄôConnell began painting at the age of 22. He supported himself in Paris as a sidewalk caricaturist while working on abstract paintings. According to O'Connell, influences on his painting were French Abstract-Expressionist artists including Pierre Soulages and Nicolas de Sta√´l. O'Connell became known for his large impressionist paintings of the aisles of Walmart supermarkets. The initial works were created from photographs of people shopping at Walmart. According to art critic Joe Fyfe, the works are an \\"idiosyncratic\\" combination of \\"kitschy decorative art, almost tourist painting\\" and high art. O'Connell's canvasses have been exhibited in New York; Boston; Atlanta, Georgia; Turin, Italy and Shanghai, China. National interest in Brendan began after he was profiled by Susan Orlean in the New Yorker. This was followed by his first television appearance on The Colbert Report. Brendan continues to do live paintings for the local media in Walmarts around the United States, garnering him the nickname the \\"Warhol of Walmart.\\" He was the subject the 2013 documentary and Vimeo staff pick, \\"Blocking the Bread Aisle\\" by Julien Lasseur and Jamie Thalman. And was one of three artists interviewed on the Colbert Report.http://www.cc.com/video-clips/25fidf/the-colbert-report-brendan-o- connell The Colbert Report =Everyartist.me= In 2012, O'Connell helped organize the Wal-Art Project in which more than 8,400 children gathered in a stadium in Bentonville, Arkansas, the location of Walmart‚Äôs headquarters, to display their artwork. According to O'Connell, the purpose of the project was to inspire the artistic creativity of everyone. Brendan used the Wal-Art Project as a springboard for Everyartist.me, a social enterprise that creates the annual Everyartist Live! art event. In November 2013, Brendan organized a national, collaborative painting event with 230,000 children across 46 states with Everyartist Live!

He was known as The Birdman of Bailey. Saving the eastern bluebird Finch recognized that when tobacco curing barns switched from wood to gas or oil fired heaters in the 1940s, bluebirds were attracted to the metal vent pipes with rain caps as potential nesting sites. Millions of bluebirds became trapped in the pipes and the combustion chambers to starve. As many as 20 dead bluebirds were found when the burners were cleaned. The eastern bluebird was virtually extirpated from tobacco producing areas in the 1950s. Finch was nationally recognized for alerting the public and working to get simple wire guards put around the openings. Finch also advised others on ways to prevent unnecessary deaths of bluebirds because of modern practices such as protective tubes placed around young trees that became unintended bird traps. Described as a \\"pragmatic naturalist,\\" Finch built a number of different birdhouses of different designs, then observed which were chosen by the bluebirds. He conducted tests and experiments on ways to protect bluebird nest boxes from snakes and other predators. He constructed a snake pit filled with black rat snakes to support his experiments and test predator guards. Results of those tests are referenced in a number of books on bluebirds. Homes for bluebirds While working with his teenage son in December 1971, Finch heard the distinctive sound of a bluebird. Finch immediately stopped his work and built seven bluebird houses that day. Two days later, he saw bluebirds in his yard for the first time in 36 years. With the help of the local Ruritan club, Finch founded the nonprofit Homes for Bluebirds, Inc. in 1973. That organization built and distributed over 60,000 bluebird boxes by the mid-1990s and continues to sell them at cost. Recognition and legacy In 1990, Finch's efforts to save bluebirds was featured on the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather as part of the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Earth Day. Correspondent Bob McNamara remembers that story as one of his favorites. After the story aired, \\"the New York phone lines were flooded with inquiries about how to get the birdhouses\\". A roadside sign was funded and erected by the North Carolina Bluebird Society in honor of Jack Finch. It was dedicated on October 24, 2009.

It is the repeating unit in the skeleton of the unbranched alkanes. A methylene bridge can also act as a bidentate ligand joining two metals in a coordination compound, such as titanium and aluminum in Tebbe's reagent.W. A.

A methylene bridge is often called a methylene group or simply methylene, as in \\"methylene chloride\\" (dichloromethane ). However, the term methylene group (or \\"methylidene\\") properly applies to the group when it is connected to the rest of the molecule by a double bond, giving it chemical properties very distinct from those of a bridging group. Reactions Compounds possessing a methylene bridge located between two strong electron withdrawing groups (such as nitro, carbonyl or nitrile groups) are sometimes called active methylene compounds. Treatment of these with strong bases can form enolates or carbanions, which are often used in organic synthesis. Examples include the Knoevenagel condensation and the malonic ester synthesis.

The Museu Picasso in Barcelona, SpainGLAM Museu Picasso project page, Wikipedia. and the Derby Museum and Art Gallery in Derby, England were also early adopters of the idea.GLAM Derby project page, Wikipedia. In 2010, the Smithsonian Institution expressed interest in the idea, which led to the hiring of Sarah Stierch in July as Wikipedian in residence. The following year, the National Archives and Records Administration followed suit and hired Dominic McDevitt-Parks, a student from Simmons College, who was pursuing a master's degree in history and archives management, to work at its Archives II location in College Park, Maryland. McDevitt-Parks had been editing Wikipedia since 2004 and was hired for this position by David Ferriero. In July 2011 Wikimedia UK engaged Andy Mabbett, an editor since 2003, as an \\"outreach ambassador\\" in residence at the Bristol-based wildlife charity Wildscreen, working on the ARKive project. Since then Mabbett has been a Wikipedian in residence at other organisations such as the New Art Gallery Walsall and the Royal Society of Chemistry. In January 2013, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library became the first presidential library to hire a Wikipedian in residence, when they hired Michael Barera, a master's student at the University of Michigan. In September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration became the first organisation to employ a permanent full-time Wikipedian in residence when it hired Dominic McDevitt-Parks to join its Office of Innovation in that capacity. In March 2014, Harvard University posted a job listing seeking applicants to be their Wikipedian in residence at the Houghton Library. In October 2014, the University of Victoria Libraries announced that in collaboration with the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL) and the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences that Christian Vandendorpe had been named honorary resident Wikipedian in residence for the 2014/2015 academic year.

The primary role of the Wikipedian in Residence (WiR) is often to serve as a liaison between the host institution and the Wikimedia community by assisting with events and training that support the missions of both organisations. Typical training duties include arranging and/or leading training events and editathons; and providing explanations to other staff and members of the public about policies and practices, such as policies about conflict-of-interest. Editing activities may include making contributions to articles relevant to the institution's materials and mission, such as articles about significant cultural objects in an organization's collection or articles in a specific field of knowledge. Another common form of collaboration involves digital collections. A WiR can provide training on digitization, and help upload media (with any existing metadata) to Wikimedia Commons. Wikimedia volunteers can then translate, extend, and reverify metadata, categorizing media and manually transcribing and structure scanned documents on Wikisource. The description and categorization functions on Wikimedia Commons are sometimes preferred to those of commercial websites and the institution's catalogue software. Media added to Commons are used in Wikipedia, both by the WiRs and by volunteer editors. A third form of collaboration involves datasets and APIs in their own right; for instance, the Wikimedia Foundation funded a Wikipedian in Residence at OCLC to integrate the OCLC's WorldCat Search API into Wikipedia's citation autocompletion tools, making adding references faster for Wikipedia editors. WiRs have also helped integrate ORCID metadata, and rights statement data. Some WiRs work for only a short period, down to a few weeks; others have permanent positions. In the case of short-term positions, it is important that the work to be done be well-planned in advance.  Compensation  While Wikipedia discourages direct paid compensation for article editing and prohibits undisclosed advocacy, Wikipedians in residence are permitted to be compensated for work on-wikiWikipedia:Conflict of interest#Wikipedians in residence, Wikipedia. ‚Äì either by offering credit, stipend, or salary ‚Äì through their sponsoring institutions they adhere to strict guidelines against engaging in public relations or marketing for their institution.  Reception  One such advertised post has been reported positively by others as being a \\"unique opportunity to help enrich Wikipedia and its sister projects and share with the world ... resources and knowledge.\\" Conversely, journalist Andrew Orlowski criticized another advertised post as a waste of government funds. In 2013, a part-time temporary position was advertised by the National Library of Scotland and was noted as being \\"the first large-scale partnership\\" between a Scottish institution and Wikimedia UK.

It aired on Fox in the United States on January 27, 2013, and is written by Andrew Goldberg and directed by Brian Iles. The episode's plot concerns Glenn Quagmire accidentally becoming the husband of a prostitute. He then tries to bring the marriage to an end by pretending to be gay. Plot When Peter discovers Joe has a student ID he took from a kid that gave him lip, Peter, Quagmire and Joe visit the Harvard University campus for lunch and have a wild night on the town. A drunken Quagmire accidentally marries an elderly prostitute named Charmese, who refuses to let go of their relationship and Quagmire starts to consider a divorce until Joe points out that he could lose everything. Quagmire tries to make the best of it but Charmese can't pull herself far enough out of the gutter for his tastes. When Quagmire is reluctant to pursue their relationship, Charmese questions if he's homosexual and when she says the marriage would be over if true, Quagmire pretends to be homosexual. After catching Quagmire watching straight pornography, Charmese calls off the divorce unless Quagmire can prove he's homosexual by having sex with a man. Quagmire approaches Peter with the idea. Peter agrees but insists they have a date first, through which Quagmire suffers. Back at Quagmire's house, Charmese insists they have sex and the men clumsily, reluctantly prepare. Just as they are about to have sex, Charmese calls off the charade, noting that they're clearly heterosexual but if Quagmire wants a divorce that badly, she'll grant him one. She then says that he treats her better than any other guy she's met, and doesn't want to feel like she's burdening her marriage partner. After Charmese leaves, a nearly nude Peter and Quagmire embrace in relief as Peter suddenly noted the camera on Quagmire's laptop is on. The scene then cuts to the Griffin home, with the family watching in horror while Stewie comes in and asks if they're watching Glee. Reception The episode received a 2.9 rating and was watched by a total of 5.63 million people, this made it the most watched show on Animation Domination that night beating The Cleveland Show, Bob's Burgers, American Dad! and The Simpsons. The episode was met with mixed reviews from critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C‚Äì, saying \\"It‚Äôs not necessary for Family Guy to have complete continuity, but when Peter actually becoming gay for an episode and leaving his wife is less distressing to his family than this ending, something is out of balance. This is yet another episode show that handles boundary-pushing material with tired, derivative clich√©s instead of reaching for something original and funny.\\" Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode two out of five stars, saying \\"The biggest laugh of the night came via a cutaway, where Peter as a Mexican soap opera star slapped three women and flew away in a giant sombrero. It made no sense and left me feeling terrible for myself that I laughed at it. But it was still better than most everything else tonight. Oh, and there was the irony of the band Chicago playing during a scene that took place in Boston. Hah. I don‚Äôt expect this show to be intelligent humor, but I do want to walk out of it without that kind of icky feeling that makes me regret having ever watched it in the first place.\\" References  External links   Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 11) episodes Category:American LGBT-related television episodes Category:LGBT- related animation ","title":"The Giggity Wife"},{"id":"38341197","text":"Robin Holcomb is the eponymously titled second album by Robin Holcomb, released on November 19, 1990 through Elektra Records.

He was named the 2012 Football Scoop Wide Receivers Coach of the Year while coaching at Duke. Playing career Lubick was a four-year starter at defensive back for Western Montana College and earned all-conference and NAIA All-America honors as a senior. He earned a bachelor's degree in exercise and sport science from Colorado State in 1995. Coaching career Lubick began his coaching career in 1995 as a student assistant coach and academic supervisor under his father, Sonny Lubick at Colorado State University. He then coached one season at Cal State-Northridge in 1996 and two seasons at San Jose State as wide receivers coach (1997‚Äì1998). Lubick coached the defensive backs while helping coordinate Oregon State's recruiting efforts for two seasons (1999‚Äì2000). In 2001 Lubick returned to Colorado State as wide receivers coach from 2001‚Äì2004. Lubick spent two seasons at Ole Miss, where he helped recruit star all-purpose back Dexter McCluster. Former Oregon State head coach Dennis Erickson hired Lubick again in 2007 at Arizona State, where Lubick spent three seasons before moving to Duke as passing game coordinator, receivers coach and recruiting coordinator. Lubick was one of three finalists for the American Football Coaches Association's Assistant Coach of the Year award for 2012. A big reason is the production his receivers turned in for Duke, which reached a bowl game for the first time since 1994. He was also named the wide receivers coach of the year in 2012 by footballscoop.com. Duke was the only FBS team in the country in 2012 with three receivers to catch at least 60 passes, led by Conner Vernon‚Äôs program-record 85 receptions. Vernon and Jamison Crowder also set an ACC record for most catches by a receiving tandem, combining for 157 receptions on the year. The Blue Devils were the 31st-ranked passing team in the FBS in 2012. On January 28, 2013, University of Oregon football coach Mark Helfrich hired Lubick as the Ducks' passing game coordinator and wide receivers coach. He replaced Scott Frost, who was promoted to offensive coordinator. Lubick's teaching's took Oregon's receivers to much improved level in his first season with the Ducks. Josh Huff set the single-season mark for receiving yards in a season with 1,140 - breaking a school record that stood for 43 years. Oregon set a school record for total offense in a season at 7,345, besting the old mark of 7,319 in 2011, which happened during a 14-game season. On January 1, 2016, Ducks Head Coach Mark Helfrich announced that Lubick would be promoted to Offensive Coordinator to replace the outgoing Scott Frost, who was hired as Head Coach at the University of Central Florida. Coach Frost took a similar path through the Oregon staff, being hired on as the Wide Receivers Coach when Chip Kelly was promoted to head coach in 2009. Frost was subsequently promoted to OC/QB Coach. It was announced on January 20, 2016 that Coach Lubick would continue coaching the Wide Receivers as Offensive Coordinator. Following Mark Helfrich's dismissal in December 2016 Lubick was not retained by new head coach Willie Taggart. Lubick promptly accepted the position of wide receivers coach at Ole Miss that same December. Less than a month later, he resigned to take the same position at Baylor. Two months later, he finally made up his mind and accepted a position back in the PAC-12, without ever coaching a game for the Rebels or Bears. On February 22, 2017 it was announced that Lubick would be joining Chris Petersen's staff at Washington as co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach. On January 17th, 2020 it was announced Matt Lubick would be joining Scott Frost's staff at the University of Nebraska.

Many activities of real-life fishing are included like driving the boat, assembling the lure onto the fishing rod and overcome a motley crew of fishermen at the same time. As players become successful in catching fish, they become stronger and more adept fishermen themselves. This system operates similar to a role-playing video game.

It was released on February 5, 2013, by Strange Music. It serves as the third and final installment of this \\"Coathanga Strangla\\" trilogy, following these albums; including Dinner and a Movie (2010) and Coathanga Strangla (2011). It would be his last full-length album for Strange Music, as he left the label in 2015. The album features guest appearances from Wrekonize, Bernz, Yelawolf, COS, Irv Da Phenom, Trizz, Bleezo, G-Macc, Tech N9ne and Hopsin. Background Brotha Lynch Hung has been working with a record producer Seven for ‚Äúover a year‚Äù producing his new album, called Mannibalector. Seven said, ‚ÄúLynch‚Äôs mind works differently‚Äù, his way of ‚Äúconstructing songs‚Äù is different than others. Also that Hung will ‚Äúhave the whole album structure: song titles and everything before we‚Äôve made any of the songs. It‚Äôs interesting and different to get to work that way with an artist‚Äù. Another aspect that was difficult for Hung was to find features that fit into the storyline. Hung picked Yelawolf and Hopsin as they ‚Äúfit in with their perspective that they had to follow through on‚Äù. Hung never rejected a beat from Seven ‚Äúbecause everything just matched‚Äù Lyrics and production In an interview with Strange Music, Hung said his ‚Äúlyrical ability was limited because I had to more so tell stories than mostly worry about lyrics‚Äù. The album is about an era of his life that's been ended. With Fearnet, Hung discusses about how the character within the album became this serial killer. Hung said ‚Äúhe's lost and friendless at that point, and like I said a lot of that comes from my own life, when I've let a lot of people go and went my way alone‚Äù, adding to that Hung ‚Äúused Mannibalector to get out some of those feelings‚Äù from his past. Reception =Critical response= Mannibalector received generally positive reviews from music critics. In a positive review AllMusic's David Jeffries writes \\"Hung is a craftsman, kicking off this horror movie on wax with a TV news report that gives up the back-story and then goes full Hollywood, joining skits, numerous sound effects, and a relentless, blockbuster pace, all making this an album worth avoiding if it's dark.\\" Roman Cooper of HipHopDX noted \\"Make no mistake, BLH‚Äôs emceeing arsenal is still quite impressive. Whether it‚Äôs the rapid-fire flows over the frenetic and disturbing strings of ‚ÄúKrocadil‚Äù or steady delivery over extremely minimalist production on ‚ÄúMDK,‚Äù Lynch is unquestionably adept at his craft.\\" Commercial performance Mannibalector debuted at number 67 on the US Billboard 200, at number 8 on the Top Rap Albums and at number 13 on the Top Independent Albums charts, with first-week sales of 8,000 copies in the United States.

He is best remembered for leading the opposition to the State of Franklin movement in the 1780s, as well as for his rivalry with Franklinite leader John Sevier. He served in the legislatures of Virginia, North Carolina, the Southwest Territory, and Tennessee, and was a delegate to Tennessee's 1796 constitutional convention. Tipton's homestead still stands and is managed as the Tipton-Haynes State Historic Site. Early life John Tipton was born in 1730 in Baltimore County, Maryland, one of eight children of Jonathan Tipton, a farmer, and Elizabeth (Edwards) Tipton. His ancestors hailed from England, and his paternal grandfather migrated to Maryland from Jamaica. In 1747, his family moved to the Shenandoah Valley, then on Virginia's western frontier. Tipton married Mary Butler in 1751, and they had nine sons: Samuel, Benjamin, Abraham, William, Isaac, Jacob, John, Thomas and Jonathan. By the late 1750s, Tipton as a young man owned a farm along the Shenandoah River in Frederick County, where he raised crops and livestock, and produced whiskey. In 1761, he supported George Washington's campaign for the House of Burgesses.John Parrish, Colonel John Tipton. Retrieved: 26 January 2013. When Dunmore County (modern Shenandoah County) was created from Frederick in 1772, Tipton was appointed justice of the peace in the new county by Governor Lord Dunmore. In June 1774, Tipton was elected to the county's Committee of Safety and helped craft the Woodstock Resolutions, which denounced the British Crown's actions in closing the port of Boston. He was also elected to the county's seat in the House of Burgesses. During Dunmore's War later that year, Tipton served as a captain under Andrew Lewis and saw action at the Battle of Point Pleasant in October. In the spring of 1776, Tipton, who had aligned with the growing Patriot cause, represented Dunmore County at the Virginia Conventions. He was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates that year, where he served from 1776 to 1777, and from 1778 to 1781.Carroll Van West, \\"John Tipton,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 26 January 2013. In 1777, he was reappointed justice of the peace by Governor Patrick Henry. Two years later, he was appointed recruiting officer for the Continental Army's Virginia line. In 1780, he was appointed Commissioner of the Provision of Law by Governor Thomas Jefferson. As principal officer of the Shenandoah militia during the war, he obtained the title of colonel. During the course of the American Revolution, Tipton suffered a number of personal tragedies. His wife, Mary, died in 1776 while giving birth. He married a widow, Martha (Denton) Moore. His son, Abraham, was killed while fighting under George Rogers Clark. When Tipton and his second wife had a son together, they named him Abraham, for the son who had died. His son, William, was badly wounded during the Siege of Savannah. State of Franklin In the 1770s, Tipton's brothers Jonathan and Joseph, along with their aging father, moved to the Tennessee frontier, which at the time was controlled by a fledgling government known as the Watauga Association. Jonathan Tipton (frequently confused with John Tipton by historians) signed the Watauga Petition in 1776 and fought at the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780. John Tipton followed his brothers to Watauga in 1783 and purchased what is now known as the Tipton-Haynes site in May 1784. In June 1784, North Carolina ceded its lands west of the Appalachian Mountains (i.e., modern Tennessee) to the Continental Congress. Though the North Carolina legislature rescinded this cession in October, a movement to form a new state (eventually known as the State of Franklin) had already developed and had called for a convention to meet in December.Michael Toomey, \\"State of Franklin,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 26 January 2013. At this convention, a resolution was introduced to move forward with the formation of a new state. Tipton voted against the resolution, but it passed, 28 to 15.J. G. M. Ramsey, The Annals of Tennessee (Overmountain Press, 1999), pp. 288, 339-340, 404-411, 425. The supporters of the State of Franklin elected John Sevier as governor of the proposed state. Tennessee residents who sought to remain with North Carolina threw their support behind Tipton, electing him to Washington County's seat in the North Carolina Senate in 1786. The Franklinites and loyalists (the latter sometimes called \\"Tiptonites\\") set up parallel governments that gradually grew hostile to one another. They raided each other's courthouses and seized each other's court documents. At one point, Tipton and Sevier scuffled in the streets of Jonesborough. The rivalry between Sevier and Tipton climaxed in late February 1788 in an incident known as the \\"Battle of Franklin\\". While Sevier was away campaigning against the Cherokee, Tipton ordered some of Sevier's slaves to be seized for taxes supposedly owed to North Carolina. When Sevier learned of what had occurred, he led around 150 militia to Tipton's farm and demanded he return the slaves. Tipton refused, and gunfire was briefly exchanged as Sevier's forces surrounded Tipton's house. Two days after the siege began, a Sullivan County militia loyal to North Carolina arrived on the scene and scattered Sevier's forces. Two of Sevier's sons were captured, and Tipton initially demanded they be hanged. He was persuaded to release them. Following this engagement, the State of Franklin movement largely collapsed. Tipton attended North Carolina's Hillsboro Convention in March 1788, where he voted against the state's ratification of the newly proposed United States Constitution, arguing the document lacked a Bill of Rights. He was reelected to the state senate later that year. In July 1788, Governor Samuel Johnston issued a warrant for Sevier's arrest. In October, Sevier was involved in a melee in Jonesborough, and Tipton was notified that he was staying in the home of Mrs. Jacob Brown. Tipton formed a posse and surrounded the Brown home. Mrs. Jacob Brown sat down in the doorway to prevent Tipton from entering, while Sevier stepped out through a side door and surrendered to a more amiable loyalist, Colonel Robert Love. Tipton sent Sevier to North Carolina to stand trial for treason. Upon his arrival in Morganton, however, he was promptly released.Kevin Barksdale, The Lost State of Franklin: America's First Secession (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2009), pp. 139-141. Southwest Territory and Tennessee In November 1789, North Carolina ratified the U.S. Constitution and passed a second cession act in December, ceding its trans-Appalachian lands to the new U.S. government. The U.S. government organized the new lands into the Southwest Territory, and William Blount was appointed governor of the new territory. Upon his arrival in East Tennessee, Blount sought to end the feud between Tipton and Sevier. He initially offered Tipton a position as justice of the peace, but Tipton turned it down. In March 1792, Blount visited Tipton's home and personally convinced him to curtail his enmity toward Sevier. In Blount's presence, Tipton burned a petition that had been circulating to discredit Sevier.Walter Durham, Before Tennessee: The Southwest Territory, 1790-1796 (Rocky Mount Historical Association, 1990), pp. 42, 109. In 1794, Tipton was elected to the territorial legislature, where he served on the Committee for Petitions and Grievances alongside James White and William Cocke. In 1796, Tipton was a delegate from Washington County to the state constitutional convention, which crafted Tennessee's first constitution. That same year, he was elected to the Tennessee Senate, in which he served until 1799. He aligned with rising politician Andrew Jackson and tried to help Jackson and Governor Archibald Roane prove land fraud accusations against Sevier in 1803. In 1795 and 1796, French botanist Andr√© Michaux stayed with Tipton while on a trip to study new plant species on the Appalachian frontier. Tipton spent his later years at his home in Washington County, where he farmed and bred racehorses. He died in August 1813 and was buried in a family plot on his farm. Family and legacy Tipton's eldest son, Samuel (1752-1833), is considered the founder of Elizabethton, Tennessee. He deeded the land on which the city was founded in the 1790s as Tiptonville.W. Eugene Cox and Joyce Cox, An American Saga: Some East Tennessee Taylors (iUniverse, 2011), p. 17.Historical marker in downtown Elizabethton. Accessed: 26 January 2013. Tipton's son, Jacob (1765-1791), was killed at St. Clair's Defeat in 1791. He was the second son to die in war. Tipton County, Tennessee, is named in Jacob's honor.Russell Bailey, \\"History of Tipton County ,\\" Tipton County official website. Retrieved: 26 January 2013. In the early 19th century, Tipton's son, William (1761-1849), known as \\"Fighting Billy,\\" acquired much of the land in Cades Cove, in the Great Smoky Mountains. Tipton's in-law, Joshua Jobe, convinced John Oliver to become the Cove's first white settler in 1818.Colonel John Tipton: Sons. Retrieved: 26 January 2013.Durwood Dunn, Cades Cove: The Life and Death of An Appalachian Community (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), pp. 3, 14. The Tipton Place, built by Tipton's descendants in the 1880s, still stands along the Cades Cove Loop Road. Tipton's great-nephew, John Tipton (1786-1839), fought at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. He was elected by the Indiana state legislature as a U.S. senator in the 1830s. He was a great-grandson of Tipton's uncle, William (1696-1726).Would the Real John Tipton (1730-1813) Please Stand Up? . Tipton-Haynes Link, Vols. 23-24 (Spring 2011), p. 3. Retrieved: 26 January 2013. Tipton County, Indiana; Tipton, Indiana, and Tipton, Iowa, are all named for him. Tipton's farm, the Tipton-Haynes Place in Johnson City, is now designated as a state historic site. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. When the state acquired the farm in 1945, historian Samuel Cole Williams spoke at its dedication. For years after Tipton's death, the leader was criticized by historians, most of whom held favorable views of his rival, Sevier. Sevier's early biographer, James B. Gilmore, was particularly hostile toward Tipton, and historian James Phelan, in his 1888 History of Tennessee, describes Tipton as a temperamental and jealous individual who \\"lacked intellectual force.\\"James Phelan, History of Tennessee: The Making of a State (Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1888), p. 86.

He is the author of five novels: Dot Dead (2006), Smasher (2009), Drop By Drop: A Thriller (2011), A Fine and Dangerous Season (2012), and Temple Mount (2014). After graduating from Harvard Law School, Raffel served as counsel to the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence during the late 1970s and early 1980s. He returned to his home state of California in 1982, where he unsuccessfully ran for United States Congress. Raffel then embarked on business career in the technology sector. In 1996, he founded UpShot Corporation, a customer relationship management (CRM) software company that was a pioneer in cloud computing and was later acquired by Siebel Systems. From 2011 to 2013 Raffel served as senior vice president and chief commercial officer at Complete Genomics, a life sciences company that specializes in human genome sequencing and analysis. He is currently a resident scholar and lecturer at Harvard University. Early life and education Raffel was born in 1951, grew up in Palo Alto, California, and attended Palo Alto High School. He graduated from Harvard College with a Bachelor of Arts and from Harvard Law School with a Juris Doctor. He also earned a Master of Letters in modern history from the University of Oxford. Political career Raffel served as counsel to the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from 1977 to 1981. During this time Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (1978), the Classified Information Procedures Act (1980), and the Intelligence Oversight Act (1980). In 1982, Raffel ran for the Democratic Party nomination for the United States House of Representatives seat from California's 12th congressional district, which was vacated by incumbent Republican Pete McCloskey. Raffel was defeated in the primary election. The seat was eventually won by Republican Ed Zschau. Business/academic career Raffel served in a number of executive roles with ROLM from 1982 to 1989 and with Echelon Corporation from 1989 to 1996. In 1996, he founded UpShot Corporation, a software company that delivered Internet-based customer relationship management and sales automation tools for businesses. UpShot was the first company in Silicon Valley to provide cloud computing solutions. Within two years, UpShot released its first product, and by 2003 the company provided services for small, midsize, and large organizations. UpShot competed with Salesforce.com for market share among large, Fortune 1000 companies. In July 2003, Salesforce.com filed a complaint against UpShot in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, claiming that advertising put out by Raffel's firm had violated state and federal laws pertaining to fair business competition. Raffel argued that his firm's ads were truthful, and noted that Salesforce.com had been aggressive in its advertising, particularly in targeting Siebel Systems. He was quoted as saying, \\"Salesforce suing over an ad is like the person who kills both his parents and then asks for mercy because he's an orphan.\\" In November 2003, Siebel Systems purchased UpShot for $70 million. Raffel then worked for Siebel until 2006, when it was purchased by Oracle Corporation. He remained with Oracle until 2008. At Siebel, Raffel served as group vice president of the company's OnDemand operation, where he oversaw a series of software upgrades and added features to provide social networking and market segmentation tools to his firm's customers. In June 2011 Raffel joined Complete Genomics as Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. The life sciences company, based in the Mountain View, California, began operations in 2006, and provides sequencing and analysis of human genomic data. He left the company in June 2013 three months after it was purchased by the Chinese company, BGI-Shenzhen. Since September 2017, he has been at Harvard University where he serves as writer-in-residence in Mather House, a fellow at the Office of Career Services, and a lecturer at the Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He will be co-teaching Eng-Sci-28, ‚ÄúTechnology, Ethics, and Society‚Äù in the spring semester of the 2018-2019 academic year. Writing career Raffel's first novel, Dot Dead, was published in 2006 by Midnight Ink, an imprint of Llewellyn Worldwide of Woodbury, Minnesota. The murder mystery is set in Silicon Valley, and centers on Ian Michaels, a young technology executive. Michaels discovers his housekeeper, Gwendolyn Goldberg, dead on his bed when he returns home one day, and is suspected of her murder. The New York Times called Dot Dead \\"a murder mystery worthy of a Steve Jobs keynote presentation\\".http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/for-silicon-valley- novels-blurring-fiction-and-non-fiction/ Raffel followed up with his second novel in 2009, entitled Smasher, which was also published by Midnight Ink. Smasher continues the story of Ian Michaels as he defends his company from a potential takeover, investigates the work of his aunt at Stanford University's physics department, and protects his wife‚Äîa deputy district attorney‚Äîfrom a mysterious threat. Raffel's third novel, Drop By Drop: A Thriller, was published in 2011. The story's main character is Sam Rockman, a history professor at Stanford, who loses his wife in a bombing at San Francisco International Airport. Rockman reunites with a United States Senator for whom he had worked before graduate school, and is appointed to the Senate's Intelligence Committee to investigate the terrorist attack. Raffel's fourth novel, A Fine and Dangerous Season, was self-published in September 2012 and republished by Thomas & Mercer, an imprint of Amazon Publishing, in November 2013.http://www.apub.com/imprints The work of historical fiction is set during the Cuban Missile Crisis and is centered upon Nathan Michaels, a salesman for Hewlett-Packard who knew President Kennedy two decades earlier during their time at Stanford. Kennedy enlists Michaels to use his connections to a KGB agent to communicate with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and resolve the international crisis. Reviews of Drop By Drop and A Fine and Dangerous Season have noted Raffel's professional experience in Washington, D.C. and the verisimilitude with which he portrayed the workings of the government in his novels. Raffel raised the funds to publish and publicize his fifth novel via a Kickstarter campaign where he crowd-sourced comments, edits, and suggestions.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1488262238/join-me-in- publishing-temple-mount-my-5th-novel Maris Kreizman of Kickstarter commented, \\"It was the first time I'd come across a project in which an author specifically solicited editorial feedback from backers‚Ä¶.

Her scholarship remains a benchmark to this day. She researched and taught Indian art history for more than six decades on three continents. After writing her dissertation on the essence of early-buddhist sculpture in India, she was invited to teach at Kala Bhavana in Shantiniketan (1922‚Äì24) and went on to teach at Calcutta University from 1924‚Äì1950. In Europe, Kramrisch worked at the Courtauld Institute, London (1937‚Äì1940). From 1950, she was professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of South Asia Regional Studies, where she had been recruited by W. Norman Brown, in addition to being a prominent curator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Early life and education in Vienna Stella Kramrisch was born on May 29, 1896, in Nikolsburg, now Mikulov, in Austria.\\"Stella Kramrisch, Indian-Art Expert and Professor, 97\\", The New York Times. Retrieved 1 January 2015. She was trained as a ballet dancer growing up in Austria. When Kramrisch was about 10 her parents moved to Vienna. One day she came across a translation of the Bhagavadgita: \\"I was so impressed it took my breath away.\\"A Meeting Of Art, India And Devotion - Page 2 - Philly.com She had found what she wanted to do in her life. She enrolled at the University of Vienna, studying at the department of art history with Professors Max Dvo≈ô√°k and Josef Strzygowski. She focused her studied on Indian art and culture. Thus she learned Sanskrit and read philosophy, literature and anthropology. In 1919, she successfully completed her studies by earning her doctorate.Sozanski, Edward J., \\"Indian Art Expert S. Kramrisch Dies at 97\\", Philly.com. Retrieved 1 January 2015. Professional life in India She traveled to London in 1919 as part of a university delegation to give three lectures at Oxford. Rabindranath Tagore heard her speak and invited her to come to India and teach at the Visva- Bharati University in Santiniketan in 1922. She was appointed professor of Indian art at the University of Calcutta in 1924, where she taught until 1950. In 1924 her first monograph Principles of Indian Art was published in German, which was reviewed widely in various journals throughout Europe. In the 1920s Kramrisch kept traveling to Vienna to give lectures. Various articles of her colleagues in Vienna appear as English translations in the Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, which Kramrisch edited from 1933 onwards together with Abanindranath Tagore. Her seminal publication \\"Indian sculpture\\" (1933) was a profound analysis of Indian sculpture, conceptualized in size and format to function as an actual handbook. After the British left India in 1947, her husband Laszlo Nemenyi opted to work for the new government of Pakistan and moved to Karachi. In 1950 he was found shot dead on a beach. She emigrated to America the same year. Professional life in the United States Stella Kramrisch moved to the United States in 1950, invited by the Sanskritist W. Norman Brown to teach in the newly formed Department of South Asia Regional Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. She was Professor of South Asian Art until her retirement in 1969. She was also Adjunct Professor of Indian Art at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York from 1964-1982. She served as the Curator of Indian Art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1954 until 1979 and was Curator Emeritus until her death. During her tenure at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Kramrisch developed its holdings in Indian and Himalayan art and staged a series of ambitious exhibitions that, accompanied by the catalogues and related studies that she wrote, brought significant recognition to the Museum and to the field of Indian art and culture. One such exhibition opened in 1968. Entitled ‚ÄúUnknown India: Ritual Art in Tribe and Village,‚Äù it showcased nearly 500 religious and secular objects. After twelve years of planning, research and negotiations, another ground-breaking exhibition, ‚ÄúManifestations of Shiva‚Äù opened in 1981. It was the first major exhibition in this country to examine the religious deity and to explore the multiple interpretations of its meaning. Many of the 197 objects displayed had never before left India. As to the Museum‚Äôs own collections, Kramrisch oversaw important acquisitions, including a 6th century bronze mask of Shiva, a bronze figure of Rama made during the Chola dynasty of Southern India, and ‚ÄúRadha and Krishna,‚Äù a painting by a Kishangarh school artist. Her books include Grundz√ºge der Indischen Kunst (Principles of Indian Art; 1924; her first book), The Hindu Temple vols. 1 & 2 (1946; re-printed and in global circulation), The Art of India: Traditions of Indian Sculpture, Painting And Architecture (1954), and the encyclopedic The Presence of Siva (1981). She was a friend of the ballerina, designer, actress, and collector Natacha Rambova. Barbara Stoler Miller and Wayne E. Begley were among her students. Prof. Kramrisch was succeeded by Michael W. Meister in 1976 who is currently the W. Norman Brown Professor of South Asia Studies and History of Art at the University of Pennsylvania. Kramrisch died on August 31, 1993, at her home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Awards and honors Kramrisch received worldwide recognition for her many achievements, including honorary degrees from Visvabharati University (1974) and from the University of Pennsylvania (1981). At a ceremony held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1979, Kramrisch was given the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art, and in 1985 she received the Charles Lang Freer Medal for her contribution to the ‚Äúunderstanding of Oriental civilization as reflected in their arts.‚Äù Perhaps the most telling statement of Kramrisch‚Äôs life‚Äôs work came in 1982 when the Indian government presented her with its highest civilian honor of Padma Bhushan. Kramrisch received the honor for ‚Äústimulating a renewed interest not only in the artistic heritage of India but also in its underlying philosophies and world view.‚Äù Legacy At the time of her death, Kramrisch left a bequest of 25 works to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. She also donated her papers to the museum, which in many ways form the greatest scope of her legacy. The Stella Kramrisch papers house her correspondence, writings and other research materials from 1921 to 1999, and contain information about the art objects in Kramrisch‚Äôs personal collection. In addition, Kramrisch's curatorial position was officially re-titled as the Stella Kramrisch Curator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a position which still exists today.\\"Historical Note\\", Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Lee made her political debut on the 2011 election where she contested the single-member constituency of Punggol East. She served as the Member of Parliament upon winning the 2013's by-election from 26 January 2013 till 11 September 2015, where she lost her seat to Charles Chong in the 2015 election by a narrow margin. She is appointed as a member of Sengkang Town Council since 20 August 2020. Career Outside politics, Lee worked as a Business Development Executive at Clapper (S) Pte Ltd (2000‚Äì2003), a Financial Consultant for American International Assurance (2003‚Äì2005), a Broker with CIMB-GK Securities (2005‚Äì2006), a Recruitment Manager for Prudential Assurance (2006‚Äì2008) and a Senior Trainer at Great Eastern Life Assurance (2008‚Äì2013). Lee resigned from her job as a financial trainer to serve as a full-time MP following her victory in the Punggol East by-election. =Political career= Lee was the Workers' Party's Deputy Treasurer from 2008 to 2011, the party's Youth Wing President from 2011 to 2012 and the Deputy Webmaster from 2012 to 2014. Since 2014, she has been the Organising Secretary on the party's Executive Council. Prior to her election to parliament, she also served as a legislative assistant to Pritam Singh, who he was now the Secretary-General of the party since 2018, and as an MP of the Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (which the party first captured the constituency in the 2011 general election. Lee made her debut in the political arena on the 2011 general election where she was fielded as a candidate representing the Punggol East SMC (a ward formerly part of the neighbouring Pasir Ris‚ÄìPunggol GRC), where she was defeated to the governing People's Action Party (PAP) candidate, Michael Palmer (who was made as a Speaker of Parliament post-election), with 16,994 (54.54%) to 12,777 votes (41.01%) (a third candidate, Desmond Lim of the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA), received only 1,387 votes (4.45%)). However, on 12 December 2012, Palmer resigned his Speaker and MP post citing that he had an extra-marital affair against a constituency director from Pasir Ris West division, eventually precipitated a by-election which would be held on January 2013. On the same day, then-Secretary General of WP, Low Thia Khiang announced the party candidacy, and would field Lee to contest the seat again in the forthcoming by-election. At the close of the nomination (on January 16), Lee faced a rare four-cornered contest between PAP's Koh Poh Koon (a colorectal surgeon who joined the party three months prior), the SDA's Lim, and a fourth candidate, the Reform Party's Secretary-General Kenneth Jeyaretnam. On 26 January, Lee won the election with 16,045 votes (54.50%), with her rivals Koh, Jeyaretnam and Lim, received 12,875 (43.73%), 353 (1.20%) and 168 votes (0.57%), respectively. This win marked the second time after the 1981 by-election the WP had captured another parliamentary seat after a by-election, and Lee was also the first female candidate to control a SMC. Upon her win, Lee told the media that her immediate priority as Member of Parliament would be to ensure the smooth handover of the Town Council from the ruling PAP. Lee was sworn in as a Member of Parliament on 4 February 2013. In the 2015 General Election, Lee was announced as a candidate who would defend the constituency, and on 27 August, PAP revealed that six-term MP and Deputy Speaker Charles Chong would be the challenger. On 11 September, Lee was defeated in her re-election 48.24% to 51.76%, and thus returning Punggol East SMC to the PAP. Although she was offered a Non-Constituency MP (NCMP) position by-virtue for being the best- scoring losers of the election, Lee declined the offer, the first time someone had done so since 1984 (two candidates, M. P. D. Nair and Tan Chee Kien, who were also offered a position but neither accepted the offer). It was later revealed that Daniel Goh, a candidate part of the Workers' Party team for the East Coast GRC, would replace Lee as the last NCMP seat, on 4 February 2016. Education Lee was educated at Holy Innocents' High School and Ngee Ann Polytechnic, before earning a Bachelor's degree from Curtin University in 2001. Personal life Lee is married to Koh Chee Koon, a telecommunications consultant. On 15 January 2014, it was announced that she is pregnant with her first child and on 1 July 2014, she gave birth to a baby girl.

Official insignia The installation commander of Joint Base Andrews approved a logo re-design in the spring of 2014, which aimed to improve the branding and the overall appearance of the installation across all platforms. The project took several months and went through numerous design changes before approval, but was finalized in the late summer. The new JBA logo project was led and chiefly designed by Senior Airman Dan Burkhardt with important contributions by Mr. Dean Markos, who were both serving the Air Force in the 11th Wing Public Affairs office. The logo was approved and disseminated across all digital platforms and marketed locally in the fall of 2014. The new logo was re-designed with a flatter, more modern design aesthetic that could comfortably occupy a number of different mediums, from mobile apps, to installation trucks and signs. Contained in it are a number of design elements that refer directly to the joint mission of the installation, which is home to several Air Force Major Commands, Naval Commands, a Marine detachment and a number of other military and government related units. =Design elements= *U.S. Capitol Building: The Capitol Building refers to the location of the installation (just outside Washington D.C.) and critical role it plays in supporting the operations and leadership of the U.S. Government. *Dual Planes with Contrails: The two planes taking off with contrails flowing downward signify the aerial missions that Joint Base Andrews either hosts or supports directly every day, including the operations and maintenance of Air Force One. *America's Airfield: This phrase (one of several unofficial tag-lines of the installation) refers to the mission- critical role that Joint Base Andrews plays in national defense, government and diplomacy. *Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington: Unlike the previous logo design, the new design incorporates the official name of the installation in the post-BRAC era. =Additional versions of the official logo= left center See also * List of United States Air Force installations  Notes   References  Attribution: : :  External links  * Joint Base Andrews Air & Space Expo 2019 * Joint Service Open House and Airshow at Andrews Air Force Base * Why is it Named Andrews Air Force Base?

The former Hanseatic city lies on the Baltic coast of modern-day Germany. History =Early History= Following the Polish War and the Thirty Years' War, Sweden held extensive control over the lands on the southern Baltic coast, including Pomerania and parts of Livonia and Prussia. Wismar was first occupied by Sweden in 1628. The military occupation was converted into full ownership at the Peace of Westphalia. The city quickly became the administrative center of all of Sweden's German possessions when the Royal Swedish Tribunal was set up in the F√ºrstenhof. This necessitated a buildup of Wismar's fortifications, an operation that Field Marshal Erik Dahlbergh was appointed to lead. The result was completely self-contained fortifications with bulwarks as an effective all-round defence system ‚Äì a system meeting the most modern requirements was thus refined to great efficiency. Remains of these fortifications have been preserved, among other places, in the ‚ÄòLindengarten' to the east of the wall of the old city. =Great Northern War= Wismar was occupied by a coalition of Danish, Prussian, and Hanoverian troops during the Great Northern War of 1700‚Äì1721. This resulted in the destruction of the city's elaborate defence system. After the Treaty of Frederiksborg ended the war, Wismar was returned to Swedish control. However, since Sweden had lost several nearby possessions (such as Bremen-Verden) to its rivals, Wismar began to lose significance as it became more of an outpost of Swedish control rather than the center of a larger hub. =End of Swedish Rule= In 1803 Sweden pledged both the town and lordship to Mecklenburg-Schwerin for 1,258,000 Riksdaler, reserving, however, the right of redemption after 100 years. In view of this contingent right of Sweden, Wismar was not represented at the diet of Mecklenburg until 1897. In 1903 Sweden finally renounced its claims on the town. Architecture The Alter Schwede (Old Swede) building in central Wismar Many of Wismar's most distinctive buildings were built during this period of Swedish control. The building styles of Sweden mixed with the methods prevalent during Wismar's time in the Hanseatic League to create an architectural theme unique to the Baltic coast of Germany and Poland. The evidence of this historic style, known as Brick Gothic, in a number of structures led to them receiving the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2002. This site is shared with the city of Stralsund.

In the , Haden had a population of 195 people. Geography Haden is a small rural town approximately north of Toowoomba and north west from Brisbane. The town is set high on the Great Dividing Range, resulting in a high number of windy days. There is a picturesque lookout on the Haden- Maclagan Road to the west of the town.  History  The district was originally known as Wahoon, from an Aboriginal word meaning scrub turkey. When the railway station was established, it was named Haden railway station on 8 June 1912, after Alice Elizabeth Ruth Paget (n√©e Haden), the second wife of Walter Trueman Paget who was Secretary for Railways in 1980. The town takes its name from the railway station. Wahoon State School opened on 20 May 1912. In February 1913 it was renamed Haden State School. St John the Evangelist Anglican Church was dedicated in 1924 by The Venerable Edward Castell Osborn. Its closure circa 2013 was approved by Archbishop Phillip Aspinall. Haden had been a thriving town with numerous pubs and stores at the turn of the 20th century. With the arrival of rail and Haden State School which was opened in 1912 the town prospered. It became an established place to live, as the surrounding land was ideal for cattle and dairy farming. With the rapid increase in technology and the decline of the dairy industry in Queensland due to deregulation, the population began to decline. Only a handful of farms continue to operate in the area, with the majority of farmers turning to cattle and crop production.  Education  Haden State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 1520 Haden-Crow's Nest Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 22 students with 3 teachers (2 full- time equivalent) and 6 non-teaching staff (2 full-time equivalent). There are no secondary schools in Haden. The nearest secondary schools are in Crows Nest and Quinalow but these schools only offer secondary education to Year 10. For Years 11 and 12 the nearest secondary school is in Highfields.  Amenities  The village continues to be serviced by \\"The Haden Stores.\\" Haden State School continues providing education for students from the village and predominantly the farms to the north-west.

Notable aviation accidents On September 22, 1995, a United States Air Force Boeing E-3 Sentry airborne early warning aircraft crashed on departure from (previously named) Elmendorf Air Force Base with the loss of all 24 on board. The aircraft, serial number 77-0354, and using call sign Yukla 27, struck birds during takeoff and lost power in two of the aircraft's four engines, subsequently crashing into a wooded area less than a mile from the end of the runway. On July 28, 2010, a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft practicing for an upcoming airshow crashed into a wooded area within the base, killing all four aircrew members; three from the Alaska Air National Guard and one from the USAF. The cause of the accident has been reported to be pilot error. The pilot performed an aggressive righthand turn and ignored the aircraft's stall warning, continuing the turn until the aircraft stalled due to lack of airspeed. The low altitude of the turn made it impossible for the crew to recover from the stall in time to avoid impacting the ground.

The current workforce (military/civil service/contractor) numbers more than 11,000 with an additional 3,600 people in on-base family housing.About Naval Weapons Station Charleston Under the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission's recommendations, the Air Force is to jointly manage Naval Weapons Station Charleston and Charleston Air Force Base as Joint Base Charleston.Joint Basing with Naval Weapons Station moves forward , July 28, 2006.  History  Commissioned on November 5, 1941 as the United States Naval Ammunition Depot (NAD) consisted of 6,368 acres this is now the Station's Southside area including the Cooper River waterfront. The facility was used as an ammunition collection and distribution point during World War II. Ammunition manufactured throughout the country was sent to the base and then used to supply ordnance to Atlantic fleet vessels. Following WWII, the Depot was charged with the removal of ordnance from ships being deactivated and was used as a weapons storage site. The NAD's status changed from caretaker to inactive to maintenance to active from 1947 through 1952. During the mid-1950s, the installation was expanded, the Northside area, another 5,219 acres, was acquired by the Navy in January 1954 and called the Naval Weapons Station Annex and charged with new duties that included the handling of guided missiles and the docking, servicing and loading of submarines. Base personnel were tasked with arming submarines with the UGM-27 Polaris missile. In 1960 the Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic (POMFLANT) was constructed within the base to enable the handling of Terrier, Tarter, and, Hawk, missiles. Buildings were added again in 1969 for the Standard and Red Eye missiles. The base continued to grow through the 1970s, the Marrington area, an additional 2,894 acres located between Red Bank Road and Foster Creek, was added to the Station. The Navy designated the eastern half as the Marrington Plantation Outdoor Recreation Area and used the western half for the construction of MenRiv Housing and the adjacent support facilities. On September 30, 1981, the Station acquired the nearby Charleston Army Depot. The station's name was then changed to Naval Weapons Station South. In 1995 POMFLANT was decommissioned and the fleet ballistic missile operations moved to Kings Bay, Georgia. The Naval Nuclear Power Training Command school opened in 1998 and occupies over 50 acres in the central part of the original Marrington tract. Under the 2005 BRAC the Naval Weapons Station was combined with Charleston Air Force Base to create Joint Base Charleston. Naval Support Activity Charleston has expanded its mission and Department of Defense support role with over 40 tenant commands, and today is a training center, with the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command (NNPTC), Nuclear Power Training Unit, Propulsion Facility, and Border Patrol satellite academy; Naval Consolidated Brig, Charleston; Navy Munitions Command Unit Charleston; Explosive Ordnance Detachments; Marine Corps Reserve Center; Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center engineering complex (SPAWAR, the largest employer in the Charleston area); 269 above-ground ammunition magazines, maintenance and storage of military ordnance including mines, and serves as an Army logistics hub, the busiest continental United States surface port in the defense transportation system. In addition, it contains more than 1,800 on-base houses for Navy enlisted and officer dependents as well as Coast Guard dependents. NSA Charleston also has a child care facility, elementary and middle schools. A large medical clinic near NNPTC in Goose Creek was added in 2008.

He was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Douglass was well educated and as a boy apprenticed, in Rochester, New York, as a typesetter for his father's newspapers The North Star and Douglass' Weekly. He joined the Union Army on March 25, 1863, only two months after the Emancipation Proclamation allowed African Americans to see combat in the Union Army. He fought for one of the first official African American units in the United States during the Civil War, the famed 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. Shortly after joining the army, Douglass attained the rank of Sergeant Major, the highest rank a black man could reach. He took part in the Battle of Grimball's Landing (second James Island battle), the Second Battle of Fort Wagner, and the Battle of Olustee.Historic African American Families, http://www.fineancestry.com/lewis- henry-douglass.html, retrieved on Jan. 26, 2013 At the Second Battle of Fort Wagner, half of his regiment was killed, but this battle turned the public's attention toward the sacrifices made by African Americans in the war. Douglass addressed the bravery of the African American troops in a letter to his future wife Helen Amelia Loguen: > MORRIS ISLAND. S. C.

After the Civil War, he worked as a teacher for the Freedman's Bureau. In 1866, Lewis and his brother, Frederick Douglass, Jr. went to Denver where they were hosted by Henry O. Wagoner, a friend of their father. Wagoner taught the brothers typographySimmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising.

Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009. p160 Douglass married Helen Amelia Loguen in 1869 and moved to Washington D.C. where he became the first typesetter employed by the Government Printing Office. Douglass's employment by the Government Printing Office as typesetter did not last long because he was unable to join the typesetters' union due to racial intimidation. Like his father, Lewis Henry Douglass was a \\"valuable citizen\\" to Washington D.C. through his involvement with the New National Era and other political impact. He helped establish and was the senior editor of the New National Era (1870-1874) with his father, a \\"well conducted\\" newspaper aimed at addressing the issues of the black community in D.C. He had a political impact when appointed to the legislative council of the District of Columbia by Ulysses S. Grant where he pushed for racial equality by creating a bill like one that required restaurants to post their prices so they could not overcharge blacks. Douglass had a stroke in 1904 that greatly impacted his health and died four years later, at the age of 67.

It is located on a site in Mount Claremont, in a suburb formerly known as Graylands, after which the Hospital was named. The hospital has 178 beds, including 30 beds in the Frankland Centre, and 320 nurses on staff. History In 1909, plans were drawn up for a new \\"quiet and chronic\\" block to relieve overcrowding in the male wards at the Claremont hospital. Plans were prepared by the Public Works Department under the direction of then Principal Architect Hillson Beasley, and Acting Principal Architect William Hardwick. X Block, as it was known then (now Fortescue House), was constructed at the site that eventually became Graylands Hospital. The block was placed in an isolated position, adjacent to the dairy farm, and approximately to the east of the main Claremont Hospital for the Insane site. Similar in plan to the main hospital, this block had a central core incorporating a kitchen, a dining hall, a doctor‚Äôs residence and small rooms for the head attendant, with two wards located on either side of the core area. Two rotundas that provided shelter for patients were constructed in the outdoor area on either side of the kitchen. The four separate free-standing wards and the core buildings were connected by means of timber framed covered walkways. Each ward had a separate single-storey bathroom and latrines building located on the eastern elevation. X Block was completed by 1910‚Äì11 at a cost of ¬£24,789 and accommodated 150 patients, who worked in the adjoining farm, associated gardens and orchards located on the hospital site. The X Block wards were originally open wards, with patients on an honour system to be inside by 10pm. In 1922‚Äì23, as part of renovations carried out to the Claremont hospital, the 1904 kitchen (located on the Swanbourne hospital site) was remodelled and upgraded. As a result, the kitchen at X Block was closed. As early as 1917 there were complaints about overcrowding at Claremont Hospital for the Insane and despite the establishment of Lemnos Hospital in 1926 and Heathcote Mental Hospital in 1929, overcrowding and lack of facilities continued to be an ongoing issue for the hospital well into the 1960s. In 1939 plans were proposed for the construction of a new physical treatment block at Claremont Mental Hospital. Work was carried out by the Public Works Department under the direction of the Principal Architect, Albert Ernest (Paddy) Clare. This building, known originally as the \\"Treatment Block\\" (now known as Gascoyne House), comprised two wings of wards at right angles with associated bathroom, lavatory, treatment and recreation areas with a central administration area constructed to bisect the two wings on the diagonal. The building was constructed at an estimated cost of ¬£26,500. However, the new treatment block was taken over by the military at the outset of World War II pending the construction of the military's own hospital facility at AGH 110 (today Hollywood Private Hospital). During this period, the building was known as \\"Davies Road Service Block\\", \\"Davies Road Annexe\\", or \\"Military Block\\". Mental Health Services regained control of the block by 1945 and used it to accommodate ex-servicemen with psychiatric disorders, and by the 1950s the block became known as \\"Montrose House\\". In 1952, a new kitchen, which was attached to the dining hall, was constructed at X Block and during the late 1950s, the wards at X Block were upgraded and additional patient dining areas were provided. In 1963 the former kitchen at X Block was converted for use as a social and recreational centre. In 1954 the Commonwealth government funded the construction of a Tuberculosis Block on the Claremont Mental Hospital site, which lay across the southern end of the Hospital sports ground. This was later renovated for use as an early treatment and admissions centre, outpatients clinic and infirmary, which became part of the original Graylands Hospital complex in 1972 and was called \\"Victoria House\\". Incoming Inspector General of the Insane Dr Digby Moynagh had Montrose House renovated and on 17 April 1959 the building was re-opened as Australia's first psychiatric day hospital. The Graylands Day Hospital continued to operate on the site until it moved to Shenton Park in the 1960s, and the building was resumed for ward purposes and renamed \\"Riverton House\\" in 1967. In 1961 a sheltered workshop (Industrial Rehabilitation Unit) was constructed at Claremont Mental Hospital and by November that year, activities were established involving patients in simple production and manufacturing tasks, including the maintenance of hospital equipment and the production of concrete slabs for hospital pathways. The first building constructed for this purpose was Forrest House. By 1966‚Äì67, a number of projects had been completed at Graylands Hospital, including the construction of a cafeteria and additional workshops (De Grey House) at the Industrial Rehabilitation Unit at a cost of $70,000, the opening of two new 48-bed rehabilitation wards (Swanbourne/Shenton House and Tuart House; today Shaw and Moore Houses) in November 1966, costing approximately $380,000, and the remodeling of X Block. In 1968 the former dining hall (Anderson Hall) at X Block was also converted for reuse as a recreational hall for patients. In September 1972 the hospital was split up. Swanbourne Hospital was created consisting of the original 1904 buildings and was established to primarily treat psycho-geriatric patients and adults with developmental disabilities. Graylands Hospital became a reduced site using buildings that had been built in the second phase of building 1910-1911. The earliest buildings being the former X block, the former kitchen (becoming the patient library and Pastoral Centre) and former dining room (becoming Anderson Hall) as well as Gascoyne House. Graylands Hospital became the designated comprehensive psychiatric hospital and consisted of X Block (now Fortescue House), which at the time consisted of Nedlands, Osborne and Palmyra wards and an occupational therapy unit (the 1910‚Äì11 wards subsequently renamed), Riverton House (renamed Gascoyne House in 1989), and Shenton (Shaw) and Tuart (Moore) Houses (1966 rehabilitation wards). In 1975 a new creative expression centre (Drysdale House) comprising offices, studios, pottery areas and other work areas was constructed at Graylands Hospital. Today this is known as Creative Expression and Centre for Art Therapy, or CECAT. In 1978 three further buildings were constructed, including a new manual training centre, a new administration block (Ord House) and an intensive therapy unit or secure unit (Wembley House; renamed Ashburton House in 1989). In the mid-1980s the old Claremont Hospital sports ground (including the old tuberculosis block) was sold, and John XXIII College was constructed on the site. The College retained one set of Graylands Hospital workshops as part of its development. In 1993 the Frankland Centre was opened at the Graylands campus to house the WA State Forensic Mental Health Service. Current use Graylands Hospital is a fully accredited psychiatric teaching hospital, and has research and education facilities located on the campus. It is used as a major training facility for medical, nursing and other health professionals specialising in adult mental health. Other services at Graylands include the State Forensic Mental Health Service, the Psychiatric Services Library, CECAT an art therapy centre and Statewide Indigenous Mental Health Services.

It includes the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute, a joint academic venture between Cornell and the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology. Cornell Tech arose from an economic development initiative of Michael Bloomberg's mayoral administration in 2008. The initiative sought to attract another engineering school to the city in the hope that it would produce entrepreneurial engineers who would in turn start job-creating companies. Seven bids were submitted for the competition, with the administration ultimately selecting Cornell/Technion's bid. As proposed, Cornell Tech would create 28,000 jobs, including 8,000 for academic staff. It would also be able to create 600 companies, leading to $23 billion in economic benefits and an additional $1.4 billion in taxes, during its first three decades of operation. Cornell Tech began operations in 2012 at a temporary site, the New York City offices of Google at 111 Eighth Avenue in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, while a permanent campus was under construction. The Roosevelt Island campus's first phase opened on September 13, 2017. By 2037, the full campus is expected to span . History =Planning= The Bloomberg Center, the House, and the Tata Innovation Center In 2008, the administration of then- New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recruited Steven Strauss, an American economist and former McKinsey & Company management consultant, to oversee a series of research projects looking at the future of New York City's economy in the context of global economic trends. The analysis concluded that New York had significant opportunities in the high tech sector and recommended a series of initiatives to better capitalize on these developments. These recommendations included, but were not limited to: creation of a string of incubators, an early stage investment fund, NYC Big Apps. The success of these recommendations would hinge upon quality and quantity of technology talent in New York City. In response to this recommendation, Mayor Bloomberg launched a competition to build an applied sciences campus in New York City with a focus on entrepreneurship and job creation. In December 2010, the city requested expressions of interest from leading universities. Eighteen universities responded. Next, in July 2011, New York City published a request for proposals for the construction of an applied sciences campus. The winner would receive $100 million and free land; Roosevelt Island, Governors Island, Downtown Brooklyn, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard were discussed as locations. Seven formal proposals were submitted. They were the Amity University bid for Governors Island; the joint Carnegie Mellon University and Steiner Studios bid for Brooklyn Navy Yard; the Columbia University bid for Manhattanville; the joint Cornell University and Technion‚ÄìIsrael Institute of Technology bid for Roosevelt Island; the six-way bid of New York University, University of Toronto, University of Warwick, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, City University of New York, and Carnegie Mellon in Downtown Brooklyn; the four-way bid for New York Genome Center, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Rockefeller University, and State University of New York at Stony Brook in Midtown Manhattan; and the joint bid for Stanford University and City College of New York at Roosevelt Island. Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology were favored to win the competition, and when MIT dropped out, Stanford, which had partnered with the City College of New York, became the favorite. Cornell and Technion's joint proposal, combining Technion's reputation as the \\"MIT of Israel\\" and Cornell's presence in New York State and its land grant economic development mission, was developed in secret, in a meeting in Beijing and another three day meeting at the Cornell Club in New York City, and it was made public on October 18, 10 days before the submission deadline. The New York City Economic Development Corporation awarded the project to the Cornell/Technion bid in December 2011, after Stanford pulled out of negotiations. Part of the Cornell Tech site, as viewed from one of its buildings The Cornell/Technion bid was ultimately chosen because of its detail and scope of benefits, as well as the viability of the partnership between the two bidders. According to Crain's New York, the Cornell/Technion bid promised to create 28,000 jobs, of which 20,000 would be in construction and 8,000 would be those of academics at the campus. The bid would also be able to incubate 600 companies, create $23 billion of economic benefits, and garner $1.4 billion in taxes for the first 30 years of operation. The plan also provided for 200 professors and 2,000 students inhabiting some of campus space. The project was estimated to cost $2 billion to build. Cornell declined to build on potential sites in Brooklyn Navy Yard and Governors Island due to the lack of transit access to either location. When plans for the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island were first publicly announced, there was some opposition from Roosevelt Island residents who disliked that the construction traffic would potentially disrupt the quality of life there, as well as from pro-Palestinian activists. Additionally, there were concerns that the campus's construction might lead to a decrease in the amount of affordable housing units, since many of the island's affordable housing units, built under the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program in the 1970s, were becoming market rate housing without any of the maximum-rent restrictions provided for in the Mitchell-Lama program. Cornell Tech began operations in 2012 at a temporary site, the New York City offices of Google at 111 Eighth Avenue in Chelsea. Google's co- founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, agreed to donate some of the building's space to Cornell Tech despite their alma mater Stanford University losing the Roosevelt Island campus bid. = Financial contributions = There were several major gifts to Cornell Tech. The largest was a $350 million gift from Atlantic Philanthropies, founded by Charles Feeney (Cornell class of 1956), the owner of Duty Free Shops. There was also a $133 million gift by Qualcomm founder Irwin M. Jacobs (Cornell class of 1954, BEE class of 1956) and his wife Joan (Cornell class of 1954). In addition, Verizon Communications provided $50 million for an executive education center, and Bloomberg Philanthropies provided a $100 million gift. As part of Bloomberg Philanthropies' gift, the main academic building was renamed after the daughters of former Mayor Bloomberg, who was also the head of the foundation. Finally, Robert Frederick Smith, of the Cornell class of 1985, provided some funds to provide scholarships for students who are ethnic- and racial- minorities, part of the undergrad engineering program, and studying to be in the engineering field. Under the terms of the bid with Cornell, Technion could not use any funding to pay for the campus, as that would have involved using funds from the Israeli government. = Construction = Demolition of Goldwater Hospital Construction of the campus required demolition of the Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital's south campus and remediation of polluted land. City officials said they did not have plans to close the north campus of the hospital. Demolition began in March 2014, with the debris being removed by barge. During the demolition of the hospital, Cornell rescued several large murals at the hospital that were originally commissioned by the Federal Art Project, a subdivision of President Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration (WPA). The Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University hosted an exhibit featuring these murals from January to May 2016. These murals by Ilya Bolotowsky, Albert Swinden, and Joseph Rugolo, were set to be installed in the campus in the long term, and were ultimately installed in the Bloomberg Center. Construction of the House, the residential building, began in 2015, with the Hudson Companies and the Related Companies as the developers. Forest City Ratner was hired to build the Bridge, later renamed the Tata Innovation Center. In June 2017, the school said that three buildings on Roosevelt Island‚Äîthe Tata Innovation Center, the House, and the Bloomberg Center‚Äîwould be ready for the start of the fall 2017 semester. The first buildings opened on September 13, 2017. The campus's initial occupants consisted of 30 professors and 300 students. Subsequently, in March 2018, construction began on an 18-story, 244-room hotel at Cornell Tech, which was projected to be completed in 2020. On August 1, 2019, Greg Morrisett was named the Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of Cornell Tech. He was previously the dean of Cornell's Faculty of Computing and Information Science (CIS), and is regarded as an international expert in software security. Morrisett succeeded Cornell Tech's founding dean, Dan Huttenlocher, who was appointed as the inaugural dean of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Schwarzman College of Computing.  Campus  Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed the campus master plan and James Corner was in charge of landscape design. The full campus, due to be completed in 2037, will span . All the buildings on campus were designed to be energy-efficient. During planning for the campus, it was anticipated that all its maintenance systems \\"such as heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting and fire safety\\" would be automated. The buildings would contain modern technology such as virtual reality sets and televisions onto which laptops could stream or project. As part of a long-term sustainability plan, 20% of the campus was required to be undeveloped or open public space, and its buildings had to be built on a 500-year floodplain, which would have a 0.2% chance of flooding in any single year. The unused southern part of the campus, hosting future phases 2 and 3, was covered with a temporary rock-and- native-plant landscape. In order to promote mass transit use, the campus itself has no parking lots, instead being interconnected by pedestrian walkways and bikeways. It has connections to Manhattan via the Roosevelt Island Tramway and the New York City Subway at the Roosevelt Island station (). The subway and the bus also provide service to Queens. = Phase 1 = The Bloomberg building The first of three phases includes four buildings on of the campus, to be completed in stages between 2017 and 2019. The Bloomberg Center, the Tata Innovation Center, and the House opened in 2017, while the Executive Education Center and Hotel would open in 2019. They would all be connected by a central pedestrian corridor, later called the \\"Tech Walk\\". Planning for the first three buildings was completed in summer 2014. The main academic building of Phase 1 is called the Bloomberg Center. The $115 million, five-story structure was designed by Morphosis Architects. It was designed as \\"net-zero energy\\" building, wherein the building only uses the power it creates on its own. The city's first net-zero building, Bloomberg Center was built with energy-efficiency standards that were more stringent than the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards. As part of its net-zero-energy drive, the Bloomberg Center contains a \\"lilypad\\" array of 1,465 solar panels on its roof; 80 geothermal wells to draw heat from the ground; color-changing black-and-white discs on its facade that could either absorb or reflect heat; and a rainwater tank with a capacity of . For maximum solar coverage, the taller buildings such as the House would be located to the north of the Bloomberg Center so that the taller buildings' shadows, which face north, would not block the panels. Its interior contains a short atrium cutting through the center of the building, aligning with 57th Street across the East River from Roosevelt Island's western shore. Upon its opening, the Bloomberg Center hosted several works of art, including the Goldwater Hospital's WPA murals and two new works by Michael Riedel and Matthew Ritchie. The Tata Innovation Center, formerly the Bridge, is a corporate co-location building designed by Weiss/Manfredi. The seven-floor structure is meant primarily as a business incubator for students, faculty, and staff, with 70% of the building being commercially leased and 30% devoted to academic space. The building's roof is fitted with solar panels but doubles as an event space. The House, a , 26-floor residential building, was designed by Handel Architects, who also created each unit's furnishings. The narrow tower contains of floor area, comprising 350 units. Upon its completion, the House was proposed to be the largest and tallest energy-efficient \\"passive house\\" in the world. As it conforms with the Passive House Institute's rigorous standards, its energy output would be 60% to 70% less than if it had been built like a regular, non- energy-efficient high-rise. The House's outer walls include insulated panels, which would retain annually of carbon dioxide. The House contains microapartments as well as typical one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments leased to students at less than market rate. The Executive Education Center, named for sponsor Verizon, would be completed in 2019. It would have a 300-person hall and four classrooms that could fit 50 to 75 students. There would also be smaller conference rooms spread around the building as well as a buffet hall. Unlike the glass facade designs on the three buildings opened in 2017, the Executive Education Center would have a wood-and-aluminum facade. The center as proposed also includes a 195-room hotel, the island's first. The hotel would serve mainly to provide lodging for the campus's guests, but would also be open to New York City visitors in general. It would have a restaurant and cafe as well as a bar on the roof. The center and hotel would be connected via a corridor, skirting the campus's Tech Walk, and the hotel would also be situated above a public area. According to Cornell Tech's senior director of capital projects, the Executive Education Center and Hotel would serve as Cornell Tech's \\"front door.\\"  Curriculum  When the campus opened on Roosevelt Island in 2017, about two-thirds of the students were in Cornell's masters programs, and one third were in the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute. , Cornell Tech's students and graduates had created over 50 startups between them, and over five hundred graduates had been hired by technology companies. The Cornell's masters programs were offered in computer science, electrical and computer engineering, operations research and information engineering, an M.B.A. and a master of laws in law, technology and entrepreneurship. The Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute is a joint academic venture between Cornell and the Technion that offers two-year master's degrees programs in which students focus on one of two \\"hubs\\", \\"Connective Media\\" and \\"Health Tech,\\"; as of 2017 a third hub called \\"Urban Life\\" was planned. Graduates from the Jacobs Institute are awarded degrees by both Cornell and Technion. It also has a postdoc program called \\"Runway\\" that supports postdocs seeking to start companies such as Nanit and Data Incubator. The Jacobs Institute has an intellectual property policy of its own, not subject to Cornell's or Technion's, under which the institute grants licenses to companies started by post-docs using a simple contract and taking only a promissory note for equity valued at the support it gives to post-docs in salary and by being at Cornell Tech.  Critical reception  Alexandra Lange, writing for The New Yorker, said that the campus could \\"give Roosevelt Island the contemporary identity it has never had,\\" but that it could also possibly negate that effect if Cornell Tech were to isolate itself from the city. Justin Davidson of New York magazine wrote that the campus \\"is so ambitious that its architecture offers a mixture of delight and disappointment\\". Elizabeth Harris of The New York Times wrote that the campus \\"has the nascent feel of its own little community.\\" The presence of Cornell Tech was also said to have been an influence in Amazon's initial selection of New York City as one of two locations for Amazon HQ2, even though that plan was later withdrawn.

Introduced as a series regular in 2013, ex-con Maya comes to town looking for her daughter who was put up for adoption by Dayzee Forrester (Kristolyn Lloyd). After the child is revealed to have died, Maya falls for fashion executive Rick Forrester (Jacob Young) when she mistakes him for a waiter. Discovering Rick's true identity scares Maya into the arms of attorney Carter Walton (Lawrence Saint-Victor). Maya quickly rises to fame in the modeling world. After a failed engagement to Carter who realizes Maya loves Rick, Maya pursues Rick putting her at odds with Rick's then wife Caroline Spencer (Linsey Godfrey). After successfully breaking up the couple, Rick and Maya settle into their cushy new life ruffling quite a few feathers along the way as Maya supports Rick's ruthless business tactics. Characterized by some critics as a \\"social climber\\" and a \\"gold digger\\", Maya becomes a popular \\"love to hate\\" character for viewers due to her schemes and manipulations in her attempts to get what she wants. Daytime Confidential specifically referred to Maya as the black version of the iconic All My Children character, Erica Kane (Susan Lucci). In 2015, Maya makes history when she is revealed to be transgender‚Äîbecoming the first regular transgender character in the history of American daytime television. Not only did the reveal send shock waves through the soap genre, the story also made headlines in several mainstream media outlets including USA Today, People magazine and several LGBT publications. Maya's presence on the typically conservative soap also allows for the introduction of her family, including her sister Nicole Avant (Reign Edwards), her parents, Vivienne Avant (Anna Maria Horsford) and Julius Avant (Obba Babatund√©), her half sister Sasha Thompson (Felisha Cooper) and her cousin Alexander Avant (Adain Bradley) with the Avants becoming the first and only central African American family in the show's nearly 30-year history. Storylines Fresh out of prison, Maya comes to Los Angeles in early 2013 to confront Dayzee Leigh (Kristolyn Lloyd) demanding to know where her baby is. Maya is shocked to learn the child has died and Dayzee encourages Maya to leave town fearing Maya will upset her happy life with Marcus Forrester (Texas Battle)  the adopted son of the Forrester family fashion dynasty. While volunteering at Dayzee's coffee shop in exchange for staying in the apartment upstairs, Maya falls for Rick Forrester (Jacob Young)  believing he is a waiter. Maya notices Rick is unhappy with girlfriend Caroline Spencer (Linsey Godfrey) and tries to distract him. The two go window shopping on Rodeo Drive where they share their first kiss and when Maya is trying on gowns at the Forrester Creations boutique, she learns Rick's true identity and it scares her away. Maya finds comfort with Carter Walton (Lawrence Saint-Victor) which makes for an awkward first date at the Forrester mansion where Caroline makes sure to stake her claim on Rick. Maya turns down a second date with Carter and he assists her in getting Rick back. Rick and Maya's early romance is plagued by Caroline's interference and insults in which Caroline constantly refers to Maya by the wrong names. Maya is ecstatic when she gets cast in a movie role only to learn that it is an adult film. She turns the job down and Rick instead hires her as a spokesmodel for the company. Caroline taunts Maya about her inexperience leading to Rick hiring professionals to help train Maya. While he wants to be with Maya, Rick struggles with trying to let Caroline down easy and Maya pressures him to choose. Caroline refuses to accept that Rick is choosing Maya and her publishing mogul uncle, Bill Spencer (Don Diamont) threatens to send Maya back to prison if she doesn't stay away from Rick. Despite the threats, Maya continues seeing Rick and soon runs into her ex-boyfriend Jesse (Ricky Paull Goldin) thanks to Bill who knows that Maya being seen with Jesse could land her back in jail. Maya turns down a reunion with Jesse and is forced to tell him that their baby died. Bill threatens Maya with photographs of her encounter with Jesse and she confides in Carter and Rick about Bill's blackmail leading to Rick officially dumping Caroline for Maya. Maya is later hired by producer Rafael (Andy Zuno) to star opposite Carter in his web series, Room 8. However, the steamy romantic scenes lead to the two developing chemistry. Despite the obvious attraction, Maya remains faithful to Rick. During one particular scene, Maya hesitates and then discovers Rafael is in cahoots with Caroline to get Rick jealous enough to dump Maya. Rafael makes it up to Carter and Maya by having them shoot the series in its original incarnation. When Rick misses the Room 8 premiere in favor of work, Maya and Carter share a drink and kiss but she stops it from going any further. Having learned that Carter and Maya spent time together, Rick questions her loyalty despite Maya's assurances that nothing happened. Maya tries to reconcile with Rick only to find him with Caroline; Maya then ends the relationship and resigns from her modeling position at Forrester. Maya is shocked when Carter suddenly proposes and she accepts, believing she and Carter are a better fit for one another, like Caroline and Rick. While Carter discusses wedding plans, Maya pines for Rick and she is ready to confess until Rick and Caroline announce their engagement. Meanwhile, Carter convinces Rick to reinstate Maya at the company. Maya has seemingly made peace with the situation when Rick and Caroline marry in December 2013. Throughout 2014, Maya becomes obsessed with photographer Oliver Jones's (Zack Conroy) intentions toward Rick's niece Aly Forrester (Ashlyn Pearce) when Oliver implies that he is using Aly to secure his job. As everyone grows suspicious of Maya's interest in Oliver and Aly, she confides in Oliver that she believes she, not Caroline is the right woman for Rick. After Rick rejects her advances, Maya admits to Caroline that she fell for Carter on the rebound and just needed closure. Maya later reveals a recording where Oliver discusses using Aly to secure his job and a furious Carter dumps Maya when he confronts her about her obsession with acquiring status and prestige. Maya takes advantage of Caroline's growing closeness with Rick's stepbrother Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) and plants suspicions in the minds of Rick and Ridge's fianc√©e, Katie Logan (Heather Tom) about Caroline and Ridge's relationship. Maya later exposes Ridge and Caroline during a board meeting forcing Caroline to admit to sharing a few kisses with Ridge. A devastated Rick turns to Maya, they make love and Maya later convinces Rick to accept to CEO position from his father Eric Forrester (John McCook) despite Eric initially choosing Ridge over him. Rick and Maya soon move in together and Rick appoints Maya as the lead model at Forrester Creations. A confident Maya orders Carter to serve Caroline with annulment papers on Rick's behalf despite warnings that Rick still loves Caroline. Maya is shocked when Rick suddenly announces that he is going back to Caroline as Eric is threatening to remove him as CEO. Though she is unhappy, Rick assures Maya he wants a future with her. In 2015, Rick tricks Eric into signing a document giving him irrevocable control of the company for a year and Rick publicly announces the end of his marriage to be with Maya. Maya is shocked when Rick moves her into the Forrester mansion and replaces a portrait of deceased matriarch Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery) with a portrait of Maya instead. As Maya gloats about her victory, she is reminded that Rick has yet to profess his love for her. Thanks to Maya's insistence, Rick confesses his love for her and flaunts the relationship to Caroline. Bill resorts to threats again as Maya reluctantly welcomes her younger sister Nicole (Reign Edwards) into her life. Despite feeling uneasy at times, Maya continuously supports Rick as he spirals out of control manipulating and belittling Aly and even going so far as to shoot at Ridge and Caroline when he finds them kissing. Meanwhile, Nicole blackmails dangling a major secret over her head in exchange for several perks. With Carter's help, Maya learns Nicole has dropped out of college and tries to use it as leverage against her sister. However, Maya is stunned when Nicole confronts Maya about the fact that she is transgender. Maya confesses all to Nicole including that her daughter was actually Jesse's child whom Maya had gained custody of before being sent to prison. Though Nicole pressures her to confess, Maya warns that she needs to make that decision for herself. Maya is terrified when an angry Carter confronts her about being transgender having overheard a confrontation with Nicole and threatens to expose her. Maya apologizes for not being honest with him and talks Carter down. Later, Maya promises to come clean if Rick proposes. Maya is rightfully concerned when Nicole starts spending time with Bill's son Wyatt (Darin Brooks) and Nicole admits that she confided in Wyatt about Maya being transgender. As the gossip spreads throughout the company, Rick's mother Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) demands that Maya come clean with her son immediately. Rick finally proposes to Maya in a romantic mountain getaway and Maya makes tells Rick about being transgender just as Bill leaks the news to the press. When Maya believes Rick is embarrassed by her, she runs away in her car and Rick follows. As Maya questions if Rick still wants to marry her over the phone, the call disconnects, leading Maya to believe Rick has rejected her, although Rick has actually crashed his car. Maya resigns from her modeling position and hides out in her apartment where she reconciles with Nicole, who apologizes for telling Wyatt. As Maya is about to leave town for good, Rick tells her wants to be with her and she thanks him for defending her against Bill. After Rick is ousted as CEO by Ridge and his children, the public outcry for Maya's return leads to them both returning to the company. Maya is very uneasy when her parents, Vivienne (Anna Maria Horsford) and Julius (Obba Babatund√©) come to rescue Nicole from Maya's influence. Maya becomes the central figure of the company's California Freedom line and Rick proposes to her during the fashion show and she happily accepts. On her wedding day, Maya is devastated when she overhears Julius referring to the event as a \\"freak show\\" and Maya has second thoughts. But Nicole convinces her to enjoy her day despite Julius. Maya confronts Julius at the altar and when he admits he has not accepted Maya's transition, she ask him to leave while Vivienne stays behind. Maya and Rick are happily married on August 12, 2015. After their honeymoon, Rick and Maya settle into married life and confides in him that she's ready to start a family. Instead of adoption, Maya asks Nicole to be their surrogate so the child will be both a Forrester and an Avant. The couple are ecstatic when Nicole agrees to the surrogacy but Julius and Vivienne disapprove, fearing it will ruin Nicole's budding romance with Rick's nephew, Zende Forrester (Rome Flynn). In 2016, Maya and Rick leave the Forrester mansion after Ridge removes Maya's portrait. Meanwhile, Maya comes to Nicole's defense after she splits with Zende who struggles to accept the pregnancy. Maya and Rick later set out to dig up dirt on Ridge as leverage. Nicole has the baby and Rick and Maya decide to name her Elizabeth \\"Lizzy\\" Nicole Forrester, after Rick's maternal grandmother, Beth Logan, and her middle name being Nicole. In 2018, however, Rick and Maya divorce, obtaining joint custody of Lizzie. Development =Casting and creation= Michael Logan of TV Guide announced the casting of Karla Mosley and her former Guiding Light co-star, Lawrence Saint-Victor in December 2012. Mosley got her start on the Emmy nominated children's program Hi-5 as part of the band of the same name. Mosley made her first appearance on January 22, 2013 on a contractual basis. Mosley's character is a woman from Skid Row who shares a past with Dayzee Forrester (Kristolyn Lloyd). Mosley revealed that she was in Los Angeles and set to return to New York City for Thanksgiving in November 2012 when she was contacted by her agents about series producer and head writer Brad Bell and director Christy Dooley's interest in her. They praised Mosley's work as Christina on Guiding Light and offered her the chance to play \\"someone who's a little edgier.\\" Mosley immediately \\"jumped at the chance.\\" =Archetypes and characterization= Unlike most of the archetypal portrayals of transgender characters on television at the time, Maya has already completed her transition and is living her life. While Maya is the third transgender character in daytime history preceded by supermodel Azure (Carlotta Chang) of The City and All My Children glam rocker Zoe Luper (Jeffrey Carlson) who falls in love with resident lesbian Bianca Montgomery (Eden Riegel)  she is the first transgender character to be featured as a series regular on American Daytime television. The British soap Coronation Street established the very first regular transgender character in serialized drama in 1998 when the series introduced Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh). The 1991 film Soapdish which famously satirized the world of daytime featured the exposure of a transgender actress live on camera. Though scripted television featuring gay, lesbian and bisexual characters had become common in recent years, \\"transgender characters continue to lag behind\\" according to GLAAD's director of communications, Nick Adams. At the time of the reveal, \\"Maya Avant is currently the only transgender character on broadcast and cable television.\\" Adding to the character's unique position, Maya is also a trans woman of color working in the fashion industry. Stories for transgender characters usually featured the character coming out and then transitioning. Shows like Orange Is the New Black and Transparent regularly featured transgender characters but neither series on aired broadcast network television. Meanwhile, Fox's Glee introduced a storyline in its final season that featured a character coming out as transgender and making the transition. Mosley is also the first actress in a transgender role to be touted as her show's \\"leading lady.\\" Maya and Rick's split after the reveal leads many to question the character's longevity. However, showrunner Bradley Bell declared \\"Karla Mosley has emerged as the leading lady of B&B;, and she'll remain so.\\" Maya becomes the first transgender bride in American daytime television history when she marries Rick Forrester (Jacob Young) in August 2015. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest in April 2013, Mosley said \\"Maya is a force of nature.\\" Maya has big dreams \\"but she's naive in a lot of ways\\" said the actress. Maya is very \\"trusting, or she has been.\\" However, Maya's \\"Achilles' heel is these men who come into her life. She falls in love easily and she often gets burned.\\" Mosley described Maya as being a \\"very rational person, for the most part.\\" \\"It's so much, but I have to sometimes make sure I read the scripts in advance, because a lot of times, I'll read them and almost get a stomachache from the decisions she's about to make. I'll be like, 'Oh, Maya! I feel like in my own life, I do everything I can to avoid drama. And so then to play this character who literally walks around starting fires every where she goes is really counterintuitive.\\" Mosley who initially questioned if Maya's transgender status should affect her portrayal revealed to the Daily News that \\"it has really given me more layers and has really deepened my understanding of who she is.\\" According to Brad Bell, after being shunned by her family, \\"Maya became ornery and self-absorbed.\\" She had to become a \\"real fighter.\\" =Transgender reveal and advocacy= Executive producer and head writer Bradley Bell drew inspiration from real-life figures such transgender actress Laverne Cox (above) and also U.S. Olympic Gold medalist and television personality Caitlyn Jenner. In December 2014, Soap Opera Digest exclusively reported that Reign Edwards had been cast in the role of Nicole Avant ‚Äî Maya's younger sister. Nicole's January arrival displays quite a bit of tension between the estranged siblings because Nicole feels abandoned and Maya's secrets slowly start to unravel. There was some initial speculation among viewers that Nicole could have been Maya's daughter. Meanwhile, others had jokingly guessed the transgender angle. On March 18, 2015, without any prior announcement about the storyline, it is revealed that Maya was actually born Myron and is transgender. A thrilled Karla Mosley revealed that she was informed of her character's big secret shortly after Christmas in 2014. \\"My first reaction was surprise\\" Mosley said to USA Today noting that \\"10 or 20 years ago, this is not a story we would be telling, and not in a way that's truthful and not sensational.\\" Mosley expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to portray such a storyline. As the story took shape, Mosley did her own research by reading transgender activist Janet Mock's memoir and also going straight to those with firsthand experience; \\"I have a couple of friends who have transitioned\\" Mosley revealed. The actress wanted to be as educated on the subject as possible so she could portray Maya in the \\"most truthful and authentic way.\\" During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Mosley admitted to being a bit more protective over story development because of the importance of the topic. \\"I have had to be more firm on things than I have been in the past, because you want to tell the story, and you want to tell it right\\" Mosley stated. Like many others, Mosley herself questioned why the series didn't hire a transgender actress to portray Maya. Mosley concluded that having viewers come to know and love \\"or love to hate her\\" in the role helped because \\"there is another emotion that comes up for some viewers\\" who may be turned off by Maya being transgender. \\"We are then forced to look at why?\\" While Maya is the main focus of the story, \\"It's not just Maya's story\\" Karla Mosley insisted. The story also examines the reactions of those Maya has formed relationships with including Rick, Nicole and her ex-boyfriend Carter Walton (Saint-Victor), and later Maya's own parents. \\"So even if people have trouble relating to what Maya is going through, they might be able to see themselves in the reaction\\" of Maya's loved ones. In June 2015, Michael Logan announced that veteran actors Anna Maria Horsford and Obba Babatund√© had been cast in the role of Maya's estranged parents, Vivienne and Julius Avant and who have come rescue Nicole from Maya's influence. The arrival of the Avants makes way for viewers \\"see how Maya became the woman she is today amidst many obstacles and prejudices.\\" The reunion is the first time Maya has contact with parents since before she her \\"surgical transition\\" from Myron. Executive producer and head writer Bradley Bell revealed that the story came about because he wanted to \\"present [Mosley] with something very dramatic, something timely and topical, and I wanted her to have a secret and I thought about if she was transgender from the very beginning and I got very excited.\\" Though he admitted to being a \\"little bit concerned\\" about potential backlash, Bell said, \\"We need to take minds that have been closed and open them up a little.\\" Bell seemed to relish in touching on a transgender story from such a fresh perspective. \\"It's a new story, because the ability to do this wasn't around 20 years ago\\" he said. \\"A big part of the story is her being transgender with the man she loves\\" Bell said. He continued, \\"I'm curious to see how he reacts.\\" The story provides an \\"in-depth look at disclosure: the right and appropriate time to say something. When is waiting too long, when is too early?\\" The producers partnered with the GLAAD organization to craft the story. Representatives from the organization sat in on story meetings and helped to review scripts. GLAAD director Nick Adams was actually very hands-on in the writing process as far as helping to get the terminology correct. After the reveal when Maya reclaims her position as the face of Forrester Creations, the fictional company holds a fashion show featuring transgender models. Bell said the episodes which aired on July 16 and July 17, \\"speaks to our continued commitment to Maya's story and to the transgender community.\\" Brad Bell insisted that Mosley would be \\"front and center\\" as \\"the star of our show. We are not going to be doing this story around the edges.\\" He continued, \\"We're digging deep in this story, every facet and avenue.\\" Bell described it as \\"experimental TV\\". Whether it's done right or wrong, \\"People will object to it.\\" The story features transgender actors in recurring and guest-star roles. The lead-up to Maya's confession to Rick and her public exposure feature trans actor Scott Turner Schofield in the role of Nick, Maya's close friend and mentor. =Relationships and disclosure= The character first develops a romance with Rick Forrester (Young), who is volunteering as a waiter at the local coffee house Dayzee's. Maya assumes he is homeless. \\"I think Maya brings out something in Rick that fans aren't used to seeing\\" Mosley said of the relationship. In March 2013, it was announced the series had cast Ricky Paull Goldin as Maya's jealous ex-boyfriend, Jesse. With Rick's ex-girlfriend Caroline Spencer (Linsey Godfrey) still pursuing him, Rick and Maya start dating and Jesse threatens that new relationship. \\"He's absolutely the last person\\" Maya expects to see. According to Mosley, Maya sacrificed so much for Jesse \\"that she lost her freedom.\\" Though she should be angry Jesse is still a man she fell for and had a child with. The relationship is also plagued by Maya's insecurities. For Maya, Rick is the \\"fairy tale.\\" \\"Maya is really in love with Rick\\" but she feels insecure about him working so closely with Caroline. Rick is not supportive enough. At the same time, she falls for Carter Walton (Lawrence Saint-Victor) who \\"consistently supportive\\" Mosley said. For Maya, Carter is a \\"good guy\\" and he is her \\"good friend\\" first. For the first time, Maya is reminded how different she and Rick actually are when he isn't there for her. Maya and Carter become engaged in September 2013 but when Maya constantly tries to hold off wedding plans, they split up because she still loves Rick. \\"Their love for each other comes from them both being victims in life\\" Mosley said of Rick and Maya's relationship. She described the couple as \\"open-hearted people, who then have had to guard their hearts from being disappointed.\\" She continued, \\"But they are also connected, because they are assholes!\\" Mosley spoke with People magazine about the disclosure episode which aired on May 15, 2015, in which Maya finally confesses to Rick that she is transgender. \\"This is the scene, I think, we've all been preparing for ‚Äì both as actors and as an audience.\\" It being the \\"first time Maya has chosen to disclose to someone she loves\\" heightens the stakes. Though being so vulnerable scares her, \\"Ultimately Maya trusts Rick\\" and \\"she loves him enough to risk everything  including letting down some of the walls she's built up to protect herself  in order to be with him a healthy way.\\" Mosley explained that Maya's trepidation about revealing that she is transgender stemmed from her being afraid to lose Rick‚Äîfearing he would leave her for Caroline. Of Rick and Maya's reunion after Maya discloses her transgender status, Brad Bell said \\"This is a really fresh and unique love story, and we're only just beginning.\\" While soap couples do not last forever, Bell said \\"Right now we're concentrating on developing a strong foundation for Rick and Maya\\" one than can \\"be respected and admired. But trouble will come. It always does.\\" Rick's unconditional love softens Maya's hardened persona. =Exit= In October 2020, Mosley announced her exit from the role. In a post on social media, she stated: \\"Celebrating the incredible journey of #MayaAvant! And bidding a fond farewell to her with gratitude to all of YOU for watching. More to come from me ‚Äì stay tuned to my IG! ‚ô•Ô∏è.\\" Reception The character of Maya has mostly been well received by critics and Mosley has received critical praise for her portrayal. Jamey Giddens praised the writers for Maya's scheming nature and also praised Mosley for her portrayal of the character. The reveal that Maya is transgender made headlines everywhere, not only in the soap press, but in mainstream media as well as major publications for the LGBT community. \\"I did not realize we were going to get this kind of traction\\" Brad Bell said of the reaction. Mosley received a lot of feedback through social media with some being able to identify with the story first hand. Mosley revealed that the storyline helped one particular viewer reconnect with their own transgender child after 20 years of estrangement. The reveal left many shocked and most raved about the story decision. Kevin Mulcahy, Jr. of We Love Soaps said the series \\"has been consistently excellent over the past few years but the show topped itself today with the reveal of Maya Avant's (Karla Mosley) secret.\\" David Miller from Serial Scoop said \\"What a fantastic, and shocking, cliffhanger! Luke Kerr said \\"A creative earthquake shook Los Angeles and The Bold and the Beautiful to their core on Thursday.\\" Kerr also praised Mosley for her portrayal. New York Daily News described the plot as The Bold and the Beautiful's \\"boldest step ever.\\" Jean Bentley of Us Weekly described the plot as \\"groundbreaking\\" and exclaimed \\"Talk about a twist!\\" TheWrap described the reaction as a \\"social media frenzy\\" with viewers responding in shock and some with the help of hilarious memes. The character's name also trended on Twitter in the United States after the reveal. CBS Soaps In Depth said the series \\"broke unexpected ground\\" with the reveal. SoapCentral said \\"The Bold and the Beautiful sent shock waves through the soap opera community and beyond.\\" \\"Everything was on point\\" said Tim Teeman of The Daily Beast. While soaps have often featured \\"earth shattering\\" secrets that proved to be \\"lackluster at best\\", \\"This was not at all the case when it came to the bomb Nicole Avant had been sitting on since she strolled into Beverly Hills\\", Ashley Dionne of TVSource Magazine said. The reveal scenes \\"were something to be seen and seen again.\\" Dionnne praised the acting and said the \\"flawless portrayal of a flawed character like Maya by Karla Mosley is nothing new.\\" \\"The news of this shocker spread through media outlets faster than I could rewind my DVR to make sure I heard it correctly.\\" Dionne said the reveal \\"quickly became the most talked about moment on TV that day.\\" However, Dionne, like many others immediately questioned how much of the character's history would need to be \\"rewritten\\" to make the story work. She continued, \\"I found the move to be just as the title of the touts, Bold.\\" Tim Surette of TV Guide admitted that the plot twist on soaps had become quite \\"common,\\" and \\"the writers of The Bold and the Beautiful took the show's later shocker to a whole new level. And you know what? Good for them.\\" People magazine said \\"After 28 years on the air, Bold and the Beautiful just aired its most genuinely unexpected twist yet.\\" The storyline earned Bold a GLAAD Media Award nomination for Outstanding Daily Drama and the series was the only daily drama included in the category for the year. Viewers and critics alike where shocked and angry when Mosley was excluded from the Daytime Emmy nominations. On-Air On-Soaps said Mosley was one of the more noticeable absences. Daytime Confidential described Mosley's exclusion as a \\"baffling snub.\\" References External links * Category:The Bold and the Beautiful characters Category:Fictional African- American people Category:Fictional characters from Illinois Category:Television characters introduced in 2013 Category:Fictional models Category:Fictional socialites Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Fictional transgender and transsexual women Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees in the United States ","title":"Maya Avant"},{"id":"38342298","text":"Michael Lazarovitch is a Canadian actor who was born near Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

While \\"ruins\\" may be broadly defined as the remnants of human achievement (e.g. the remains of ancient Sumer or Machu Picchu), \\"ruins photography\\" refers specifically to the capture of urban decay in the post- industrial areas of the world. Ruins photography catalogues the abandonment and decline of cities most of all, and has sparked conversations about the role of art in various urban renewal, restoration, and conservation projects in cities throughout the globe.  Background  Though seeing a recent resurgence as a modern form of photography that focuses on urban decay, its roots come from popular notions of the picturesque which would often feature motifs concerned with the aesthetics of abandoned and dilapidated architecture. Subjects are typically large industrialized cities (e.g. New York City, Chicago, or Detroit) but can be any landscape, building, or symbolic representation of modern ruin and deindustrialization. Popular staples of ruins photography can include abandoned houses, neglected factories left over from the Industrial Revolution or auto industry booms, as well as bridges, abandoned lots, tenant or apartment buildings, or gutted theaters or offices. Photographer Camilo Jos√© Vergara helped to bring the style greater recognition in the 1990s with his books The New American Ghetto and American Ruins. In the 2010s, photographers published The Ruins of Detroit which brought renewed interest. The style relies heavily on lighting, detail close- ups, long shots, and digital imaging. Ruins photography is different from historical architectural photography in that it does not focus on comparisons between past and present, but instead focuses on the state of the subject and how it came to be dilapidated.  Reception  Some critics liken ruins photography to exploitation, comparing its appeal to that of sensationalist pornography. While most regard it for aesthetic purposes, critics find fault with the style‚Äôs minimal attention to the cities and places visited. John Patrick Leary, a professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, said: Others embrace ruins photography as a way of marketing for potential tourism, while yet others have insisted that it can serve as a powerful call to action. Responding to critics such as Leary, Detroit blogger James Griffioen suggested that there are different ways to mediatize urban and industrial decline: one spectacular and sensational (exploitative), the other more responsible. Ruins photographers are responding to critics who suggest that the genre pays little attention to local stories, by bringing the histories of the places and structures they photograph into their narratives. However, this new wave of ruins photography‚Äîmore sensitive to the histories of structures and cities‚Äîis being met by a new wave of criticism. Locals in Detroit, Chicago, and other Rust Belt cities most featured by ruins photographers, point to the continued absence of the people living among the ruins from such accounts.  Ruins around the world  Detroit, Michigan is a major center for ruins photography. Experiencing rapid population decline after the 1950s, Detroit has seen many homes and large buildings abandoned, vandalized and destroyed. Many other major cities and smaller settlements that once thrived have decayed over periods of time, some even becoming ghost towns due to economic hardship or civil unrest. The town of Centralia, Pennsylvania saw its population vanish due to a fire that spread from a nearby cemetery and ended up sparking smoldering flames in extensive abandoned coal mines below the district. The state of Pennsylvania has blocked roads to the area, but there are about ten vigilant inhabitants that remain. Other examples of urban decay include Gary, Indiana and Camden, New Jersey. Hashima Island, Nagasaki, Japan was an empty island that became populated due to its coal deposits. Home to some of Japan's first concrete high rise buildings, it became a ghost town when petroleum replaced coal. Another example of a ghost town is Kolmanskop, Namibia, built by Germans into a successful diamond mining community. After the mining stopped and the workers left, the desert repossessed the area.

Throughout the greater part of his career he was billed along with his wife, the former Maria Pray, as Mr. and Mrs. Barney Williams.Mason, James - The History of the Year 1876, 1876, p. 295 accessed 1.28.2013 When Benjamin H.

As a boy Williams ran errands, sold newspapers, worked at a printer‚Äôs office and at some point began performing bit parts at New York‚Äôs Franklin Theatre. On one night in 1836 he was given the opportunity to play a speaking r√¥le in The Ice Witch that came available after actor Alonzo Williams suddenly fell ill. As a result of his performance, Williams became a regular cast member of the theatre‚Äôs troupe performing under the stage name Barney Williams. 1850 U.S. Census, Bernard O‚ÄôFlaherty, actor- Ancestry.comDerby, George, White, James Terry - The National Cyclopedia of American Biography, Vol. 5, 1897, p. 440 Barney‚Äôs first big hit (c. 1840) was as Pat Rooney in The Omnibus (Williams: p. 69). This play was written by his mentor Tyrone Powers probably around 1833. Maria made her stage debut at the Chatham Theatre ‚Äì as a member of the corps de ballet, in the first production of a burlesque entitled \\"New York Assurance\\", which was a travesty on \\"London Assurance\\". See Clapp: p. 386; and Players: p. 387\\\\. Barney is also credited as introducing Irish clog dancing to America. In 1843 Barney played the role of Jerry Murphy in Bumpology at the Chatham theatre in New York. In these days Williams played in several roles in the Tyrone Powers repertory, including Paddy O‚ÄôRafferty in Born to Good Luck, and Terry O‚ÄôRourke in The Irish Tutor. In 1844, Barney was a member of a company owned by P.T. Barnum called a \\"Moral Lecture Room\\". By 1845, at age twenty-two, Williams was manager of Vauxhall Garden, NY, located at LaFayette Street in New York. This area later became known as The Bowery. For several seasons Williams was a popular blackface comedian touring in minstrel shows [Kentucky Minstrels] before embarking in 1846 on a long career as an Irish comedian. On November 24, 1849, Williams married actress Maria Pray (1828‚Äì1911), the widow of actor Charles Mestayer who died the previous year. She was the daughter of William Pray, an actor who perished in a New York theatre fire, and a sister of Malvina Florence, actress wife of the well-known actor William J. Florence.Mrs. Barney Williams Dead-The New York Times, May 7, 1911, p. 11 Maria and Barney Williams NYPL Digital Gallery After marrying, Barney shed his roles in the negro minstrelsy genre. In 1850 Barney and new wife Maria appeared at National Theatre in New York, in the title roles of The Irish Boy and Yankee Girl. On August 18 (1853), the Williamses commenced an engagement at Niblo‚Äôs Garden in New York, appearing in Ireland As It Is. On August 25, the couple produced their new drama, Shandy McGuire, with both in lead roles. As a team, Williams and Pray would find the greatest successes of their careers beginning [1854] with long runs at San Francisco‚Äôs Metropolitan Theatre. They also performed in Sacramento, Marysville, Stockton, Grass Valley, and Nevada. The couple set sail for London on June 7, 1855, where they performed at the Adelphi Theatre in London. The latter engagement led to a four-year tour of Europe performing in plays such as Rory O'More among others. Williams often played Irish characters to Pray's Yankee in performances that on four occasions were attended by Queen Victoria. From 1856 to 1857 the Williamses performed at The Adelphi. According to the London Times they performed the following: Bobbing Around, Polly, Won‚Äôt You Try Me, Oh?, and My Own Mary Anne. Some of their more popular performances were Ireland As it Is, Barney the Baron and Our Gal. On July 24, 1856, Barney and Maria performed for the Royal family, and again in February 1857. While in the U.K., the couple toured Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Limerick, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham. The Williamses returned to New York in October 1859. On October 17, 1859, they appeared at Niblo‚Äôs Garden playing in Born to Good Luck, An Hour in Seville, and in Latest from New York. This engagement lasted 36 nights. The two starred in annual tours throughout most of the 1860s before Williams was given the opportunity to manage (1867‚Äì1868) Wallack's Broadway Theatre. In the 1860s they most performed in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington and New York. By 1863 they were playing in Washington, D.C., performing The Fairy Circle in Grover Theatre in February. On February 26 they performed at Grover‚Äôs for Abraham Lincoln. In October 1863 Barney performed for the Union troops of the 47th New York Infantry Volunteer Infantry as they sailed down the Hudson, as mentioned by Private Miles O‚ÄôReilly. Barney and Maria appeared at Niblo‚Äôs Garden in New York in Irish and Yankee Life and The Connie Soogah, December 1864. Barney may have sung \\"The Bowld Soldier Song\\" for the Irish Brigade of the 63rd New York Volunteers in 1864. Maria debuted on French stage, April 23, 1867; she appeared in the French Theatre in New York acting the part of Caesarine Clapier in the vaudeville of Le Marly dans du Coon. Barney and Maria appeared in The Emerald Ring at the Broadway Theatre in New York, April 5, 1869. On April 28, 1869, Barney played the last night the theatre was open in Ireland As It Was as Ragged Pat. Barney and Maria began an engagement in Connie Soogah, or the Jolly Peddler on September 21, 1874, at Booth‚Äôs Theatre in New York. In December 1875 Barney performed ‚Äì perhaps for last time ‚Äì at Booth‚Äôs theatre, The Coonie Soogah and The Fairy Circle. Barney died in New York City as a result of a stroke while in his 51st year (1876).

History The construction of the Swan District Hospital was being considered in 1951. It was opened on 22 September 1954 by the Minister for Health, Emil Nulsen, as a 25-bed maternity hospital. A hospital in the Midland area had previously been requested in the 1930s. The hospital expanded with the addition of a 40-bed general wing that opened 18 October 1963. A second general wing, that also included new X-ray facilities and a nursing aide training school, opened on 20 August 1971. The Swan Valley Centre, a 25-bed mental health unit, opened in early 2001. Closure Swan District Hospital closed following the opening of the new Midland Health Campus on 24 November 2015. In September 2015, it was reported that all health services at the site except the dental clinic would cease when the main hospital closed. Kim Hames, then the state Health Minister, stated that the hospital site may be sold to pay down state debt. The site was handed to the Department of Lands in March 2016.

Professional life  Working until his death in 1940, Goss made photographs for a range of municipal departments. Some of his best-known images were taken for the Works and Health Departments. For the Works Department, he photographed street cleaning, the construction of new roads, and major infrastructure projects, such as the city's new hydroelectric system and the Bloor Viaduct. His photographs of street grading and widening, bridge, underpass, and sewer construction, street cleaning, and garbage disposal were used as records to assist with the routine business of the Works Department, which, at the time, was focused on improving the physical environment of the city.Sarah Bassnett, Picturing Toronto: Photography and the Making of a Modern City. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2016 Medical Health Officer Dr. Charles Hastings enlisted Goss's help in his crusade to improve public health. Goss photographed unsanitary and overcrowded conditions for the Health Department, and Hastings used Goss's photographs as evidence in his 1911 report on slum conditions. Many of Goss's photographs for the Health Department were never published, but were used internally to identify problems, to track the progress of particular projects, or to report on new technologies and methods for carrying out the Department's work. With Goss as the city photographer, photographs quickly became an important resource in many aspects of Toronto's municipal government.Sarah Bassnett, Picturing Toronto: Photography and the Making of a Modern City. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2016  Artistic Interests  Goss was a member of the Toronto Camera Club and an active member of the pictorialist movement. He explored customary pictorialist subject matter, such as portraits and landscapes, and experimented with the characteristic soft-focus style of pictorialism. Like others associated with the movement, Goss aimed to produce aesthetically pleasing images and viewed his artistic practice as a form of personal expression. He organized exhibitions of art photography and won awards for his own photographs, which were shown at exhibitions in Canada and England.Lilly Kolton, ed.

Canadian writer Michael Ondaatje relied on Goss‚Ä≤s photographs when researching his novel In the Skin of a Lion about the immigrant and working class experience in early 20th Century Toronto. Ondaatje decided to include Goss as a character in this novel. Following the interest in Goss, following the publication of Ondaatje‚Ä≤s novel, the City of Toronto Archives developed a special lecture and tour, tailored for students, addressing the role of Goss‚Ä≤s photos in Ondaatje's book. Goss's duties included providing a visual record of the health and social problems posed by urban poverty. Scholars have compared Goss's photographs of urban poverty to those of Jacob A. Riis and Lewis W. Hine. Decades after his death, his work is celebrated, in several books collecting his photographs, and in magazine profiles.

He also served as the MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC for Yio Chu Kang from September 2015 to June 2020.  Early life and education  Koh comes from a local Teochew family and spent the early years of his life living in Punggol, where his family lived in a farmhouse at Lorong Cheng Lim. The family then moved to a four-room HDB flat in Toa Payoh. His father was a bus driver who drove the cross-island public bus service 82. Koh was the oldest child in his family and often worked odd jobs when he was young to support the family. Koh had his early education at the now-defunct MacRitchie Primary School, before going on to study at Maris Stella High School and Hwa Chong Junior College. He then studied medicine at the National University of Singapore, graduating with an MBBS degree in 1996. He subsequently obtained an MMed (Surgery) from the National University of Singapore as well as fellowships from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the Academy of Medicine in Singapore. He also received Health Manpower Development Programme Scholarships from Singapore's Ministry of Health for advanced training in the surgical treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases in Edinburgh and at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.

Prior to his appointment as a Minister of State, Koh was the medical director and consultant colorectal surgeon at a private practice at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, as well as a consultant surgeon at both SGH and Changi General Hospital. Koh had also served as a clinical lecturer at the National University of Singapore (NUS), and as an adjunct assistant professor at the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School. His interest in medical research has also led him to serve as an adjunct clinician scientist with the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). = Political career = Koh officially entered Singapore politics in January 2013, when he contested in his first parliamentary election at the Punggol East SMC by-election as the PAP's candidate. He was defeated by the candidate of the Workers' Party, Lee Li Lian. In 2015, Koh contested in the general elections as a part of the six- member PAP team in Ang Mo Kio GRC in which the team won and Koh was elected into parliament. On 23 April 2018, Koh joined the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and was appointed as NTUC's Deputy Secretary-General.  Punggol East by-election (2013)  The by-election was triggered by the resignation of the previous Member of Parliament for the ward, the PAP's Michael Palmer (who served as the Speaker of Parliament from 2011 to 2012), who stepped down after he revealed that he had an extra-marital affair. It was reported that Koh had initially turned down Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's invitation to be the PAP's candidate in the election as he was worried that he may not be able to serve the residents well. However, after further discussions, he accepted the offer. In the by-election, Koh faced two candidates who had stood against Palmer in the 2011 general election ‚Äì Lee Li Lian of the Workers' Party (WP) (who won 41.01% of the votes in the constituency in 2011) and Desmond Lim of the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) (who won 4.45% of the votes in 2011). A fourth candidate, Kenneth Jeyaretnam of the Reform Party (RP), also joined the by-election contest, making it a four-way fight. During his campaign trail, he made a gaffe which became a central focus in his campaign. Speaking to a media query about his family owning two cars, he remarked: \\"everybody has a car, we have two... We are professionals, we need to travel\\". He was subsequently perceived as out of touch with the average worker against Worker's Party candidate Lee, who campaigned as a working mother. On polling day on 26 January 2013, Koh was defeated by Lee. He garnered 12,856 votes (43.71%) compared to Lee's 16,038 votes (54.52%). Kenneth Jeyaretnam took 353 votes (1.20%), with Desmond Lim taking 168 votes (0.57%).  Member of Parliament (2015‚Äìpresent)  On 15 August 2015, the People's Action Party (PAP) announced that Koh would be part of a six-member PAP team contesting in Ang Mo Kio GRC led by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in the 2015 general election. Following the results of the election, Koh was elected into Parliament when the six-member PAP team won and clinched 78.64% of the electorate's valid votes in the constituency. On 1 July 2020, the PAP announced that Koh would be moved to Tampines GRC as part of a five-member PAP team led by Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli in the 2020 general election, to replace Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who was being moved to East Coast GRC. Following the results of the election, Koh was elected for a second term in Parliament when the five-member PAP team won and clinched 66.41% of the electorate's valid votes in the constituency.

The name later changed further to Toruyino, where in 1738 the Bashir-Canlinian Buzdyak Ishembetov lived, by whose name this village is known today. Before construction of the Inza railway Chishmy line (1910-1912) existed the Misharsky village of Tabanlykul. Initially the railway was supposed to head north through souther Buzdyak (now Old Buzdyak), however, a group of deputies of the state Duma of the third convocation, primarily Gaisa Enikeev, made a change in the project. As a result the branch ran 4 kilometers south from the initial plan, through the dried lake Tabanlykul and further near the clan village of Enikeev Kargaly. The station that arose on the site of Tabanlykul received the name Buzdyak, and the village thus became known as Buzdyak. In February 1942, at the Buzdyak railway station, the 1097th, 1098th cannon-artillery, 121st, 122nd, and 123rd mortar regiments were formed.
