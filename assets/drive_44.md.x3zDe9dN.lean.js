It was established by Steve Nally in 1999 near Invercargill. Nally, who has a degree in chemistry, is a self-trained brewer who was an early adopter of distinct New Zealand flavours. He made an early commitment to using locally sourced ingredients at Invercargill and was one of the first craft brewers to use Gladfield malt from Dunsandel. Invercargill's first beer was an English-style pale ale IBS that was rebranded as Stanley Green in 2006. In 2000, Invercargill released Pitch Black stout - a malt driven style, designed to match the Bluff Oyster. The stout was said to stood out in a market where hop bitterness was becoming dominant. In 2001, Invercargill developed Biman for a local curry restaurant. In 2006, Invercargill Brewery upsized to a 1200-litre batch and moved to 8 Wood Street, Invercargill when Nally's interest in creating new flavours was given freer rein. In 2007, Invercargill developed Strong New Zealand Pilsner. This pilsner beer has the distinctive flavour of the new varietals developed by the New Zealand Hop Board, originally known as b-saaz and d-saaz, later marketed as Motueka and Riwaka. Also in 2007, Invercargill launched New Zealand's first commercial Manuka smoked beer - Smokin' Bishop. It won a medal at the New Zealand Beer Awards that year. It was later included in the book 1001 Beers You Must Taste Before You Die. It proved so popular it became the brewery's first winter seasonal beer. In 2008 Invercargill released Boysenbeery - a deeply hued fruit beer which also won a best in class at its Beer Awards debut. It was adopted as a summer seasonal beer. That same year, Biman received the trophy for Best New Zealand Style Beer. Biman was mentioned in Ben McFarland's book World's Best Beers The beer was rebranded as b.man to clarify pronunciation. By 2008, Invercargill had diversified into contract brewing to better utilise its plant. One of its first clients was Yeastie Boys. In 2014. Invercargill upscaled to a 2500litre plant and moved production to 72 Leet Street. In 2014, Nally received the Morton Coutts Trophy for Innovation by The New Zealand Brewers Guild for his invention of a box packaging system for beer.

The trio formed in 2008 after they met at the Devonport Folk Club (Auckland) and went on to record an EP entitled Oh, what a queer sensation later that year. The EP was described as being \\"very contemporary and yet at the same time having everything that you'd want from a really traditional folk view\\" whilst demonstrating \\"really good vocals (and) some really good songwriting\\" by Manu Taylor on National Radio's Nine till Noon music review. Music reviewer Graham Reid discussed Dickinson's songwriting in a review of the EP where he remarked that \\" as a writer, just on this one showing, she seems to be a rare one\\". Aside from one co-write with Arthur Baysting on the full album, she did not write any more songs with Forbidden Joe. Forbidden Joe produced their only full-length album In Mourning for the Pride of Petravore in 2010, which was part funded by Creative New Zealand. The trio separated in 2011 and their album was a finalist for the Vodafone New Zealand Music Award for Best Folk Album in the same year.

However it seems Merlin had dangerously extended his credit to set up the studio and without enough customers was, by May 1865, filing for insolvency. In particular, he pointed out how ‚Äòhe had been deprived by the owner of the use of certain necessary implements he had on hire for the purpose of carrying on his business.‚ÄôUnknown, ‚ÄòNew Insolvents‚Äô, The Age, (6 May 1865), 7.for comments on the deficiency sought by creditors and Merlin's wealth see Henry Beaufoy Merlin Showman and Photographer, 2018 By December 1865 the insolvency proceedings had been resolved and, with no more creditors, Merlin appears to have moved to Ballarat where his mother, now a widow, was also living.Although she was travelling under the name of Mrs Forster her husband had died in 1856.

By February 1869 his contemporaries were touting him as a successful travelling landscape photographer and he was working on an album of landscapes for His Excellency the Governor of Victoria as well as taking photographs for the Prince of Wales who was to visit Sydney in the same year.Unknown, ‚ÄòLandscape Photography‚Äô, Border Watch, (17 February 1869), 2.}} In June 1869, he was at Emerald Hill giving a ‚Äòhighly-interesting and instructive lecture The Pilgrim's Progress, illustrated with beautiful dissolving views.‚Äô His experiences over this period must have convinced him that there was money to be made taking landscape and architectural views but the failure of his studio in Kyneton and his prior experience as a travelling showman seems to have encouraged him to set up a different kind of photographic business.Henry Beaufoy Merlin Showman and Photographer, 2018 On 21 June 1869, he formed the American and Australasian [sometimes recorded as Australian] Photographic Company (AAPC). Initially, the office in Melbourne was located at 73 Little Collins Street but it seems Merlin opened a second office, at 4 Barrack Street, Sydney, in September 1869.On 16 September 1869 an advertisement for the American and Australasian Photographic Company records the sole main office as being 73 Little Collins Street. A second advertisement from 28 September adds a second city office at 4 Barrack Street Sydney.

Although the AAPC offices were located in the city, much of the business was being done in country areas. The AAPC business model adopted a new methodology to increase efficiency and mitigate the costs of travelling to country towns. And this seems in part shaped by the many years Merlin had spent promoting his theatrical events.For comments on this model and the employing other photographers including Charles Bayliss see Henry Beaufoy Merlin Showman and Photographer, 2018 Firstly, advertisements in local papers would alert the residents that a representative of the company would be arriving. Once there, the photographer would take a photograph of every house and building. The negatives would then be sent back to head office where they could be stored. As orders came in, either through the AAPC photographer or AACP representatives in the town, prints were made and sent to the purchaser.Unknown, The Benalla Ensign and Farmer's and Squatter's Journal, (8 October 1869), 2.}} This approach appears to have been set in place almost from the inception of the company. In September 1869, the company arrived in Beechworth where advertisements in the Oven and Murray Advertiser stated the town's residences would be photographed.‚ÄòAdvertising‚Äô, Ovens and Murray Advertiser, (25 September 1869), 2.}} As the year drew to a close, Merlin still appears to have been handling the bulk of the photography work.Merlin is the photographer mentioned in the advertisements but it is presumed that Charles Bayliss was also travelling with him. see Henry Beaufoy Merlin Showman and Photographer, 2018 The AAPC advertisements from this period also make it clear he was making his way towards Sydney through Emerald Hill (June), Beechworth (September), Shepparton (October) and Wangaratta (November). In December, he was at the El Dorado Goldfields where he photographed the turning of the sod for the Devon Company's first mine shaft.‚ÄòEl Dorado‚Äô, Ovens and Murray Advertiser, (7 December 1869), 4. By February 1870 he was in New South Wales visiting Yass where he made good on his advertised promises to photograph every house. Not only were the pictures done rapidly but they were also done with, with more than usual excellence.‚ÄòExtracts‚Äô, The Queanbeyan Age, (24 February 1870), 2.}} Although the photographs were for sale at the time they were taken the company representatives did not press their sale while on location. Instead, the negatives were stored at the head offices in Melbourne and Sydney and prints put on display there. From here they could be ordered as required.‚ÄòExtracts‚Äô, The Queanbeyan Age, (24 February 1870), 2. Agents were also employed by the company to sell photographs on commission.Geoff Barker, Henry Beaufoy Merlin Showman and Photographer, 2018  The Australian Eclipse Expedition 1871  Astronomers, Australian Eclipse Expedition, 1871, attributed to Beaufoy MerlinIn October, Merlin left Sydney to take photographs of Wollongong and Kiama leaving Charles Bayliss in charge of the ‚Äòsupervision of the Landscape Department‚Äô and attending to all orders, weather permitting.‚ÄòAdvertising‚Äô, The Sydney Morning Herald, (17 October 1871), 1. This arrangement may have been a way to shore up the company before Merlin's final adventure for 1871. On 27 November, Merlin left Sydney on the steamship Governor Blackall as a part of the Australian Solar Eclipse Expedition bound for North Queensland. Accompanying him on board were a ‚Äòwho's who‚Äô of Australia's natural historians and scientists all of whom were travelling to Cape Sidmouth to view the solar eclipse on 12 December. Unfortunately, after they had set up their instruments on Eclipse Island the day proved too overcast and, even though he continued to expose the plates Merlin described their trip had been in vain.Although the party decided on 6 December to land at Island No. 6 Claremont Group as shallow waters would make the landing with all their scientific equipment at Cape Sidmouth too difficult. ‚ÄòThe Eclipse Expedition‚Äô, Australian Town and Country Journal, (6 January 1872), 25. On the return journey, Merlin experimented with taking a series of coastline views of the Whitsunday Passage and succeeded in recording a considerable portion of it. These he thought would prove useful to the mariner as they reproduced the ‚Äòelevations, depressions, projections, &c;, with an accuracy impossible in hand-drawings.‚Äô Beaufoy Merlin, ‚ÄòThe Eclipse Expedition‚Äô, Australian Town and Country Journal, (6 January 1872), 25. Merlin arrived back in Sydney on Christmas Eve, ‚Äòin time to hear the joyous Christmas bells ring out.‚ÄôBeaufoy Merlin, ‚ÄòThe Eclipse Expedition‚Äô, Evening News, (2 January 1872), 3.  The Gold Rush Photographs  Mayne Street, Gulgong, 1872‚Äì1973, [attributed to] Henry Beaufoy Merlin The new year initially seemed to be business as usual for the AAPC, with operators at work in Wagga Wagga and Gympie.‚ÄòAdvertising‚Äô, The Sydney Morning Herald, (5 February 1872), 1. ‚ÄòLocal and General News‚Äô, Gympie Times and Mary River Mining Gazette, (24 January 1872), 2. But on 5 February he announced he was retiring from management of the New South Wales branch of the Company. He was replaced by Mr. Carlisle who continued to use photographic staff from the company.‚ÄòAdvertising‚Äô, Wagga Wagga Advertiser and Riverine Reporter, (20 January 1872), 3. He then packed up his camera and equipment and headed off to the newly discovered goldfields at Hill End, Tambaroora and Gulgong near Bathurst, New South Wales. This arrangement does not mean Merlin left the company, in fact he continued to supply Carlisle with negatives of Hill End to print.‚ÄòAdvertising‚Äô, The Sydney Morning Herald, (8 May 1872), 1. Merlin's photographs of shops, hotels, theatres, mines and batteries were supplemented by more traditional portraits of the townsfolk taken in the AAPC studio set up in Tambaroora and the temporary one set up at Hill End.Unknown, ‚ÄòBathurst‚Äô, Freeman's Journal, (26 October 1872), 10. The earlier work of the AACP photographers, including Merlin, had focused on landscape views. While these sometimes-included people in the streets and outside their houses this feature became even more obvious in Merlin's goldfield photos. Here people seem to have been actively encouraged to pose in front of their cottage, mine or shop and, thus, most of these 1872 views include owners, families and managers posed in front of their buildings.Henry Beaufoy Merlin, Australian Showman and Photographer , State Library of New South Wales, 2018 Contemporary newspapers cite Merlin as the photographer responsible for the 1872 landscape views taken on theNew South Wales GoldfieldsKeast Burke in his 1953 article stated that when Merlin travelled to Sydney around 1869 Bayliss had been left in charge of his studio in Victoria. This may have possibly been the case but by early 1871 Bayliss was working for Merlin in Sydney. Burke also mentions that it was Holtermann that brought Bayliss back to Sydney and there is some merit in thinking this may have been the case if Bayliss had returned to Victoria sometime after Merlin left the business in February 1872. Confusingly, Keast Burke also published a correction in the Australian Photo Review, 1 July 1853, in which he states, ‚ÄòContrary to first indication, it now appears that Charles Baylis did not remain behind in Melbourne for very long, or if at all. Fresh evidence has come to light showing that Bayliss accompanied Merlin to Gulgong and Hill End as his cameraman and photographed many of the sequences. In the face of this new evidence, it is only possible in a few instances to state with accuracy whether an exposure was made by one or the other photographer.‚Äô Unfortunately, Burke does not cite the source of this new evidence and given contemporary newspapers only mention Merlin as the photographer it seems appropriate to assume this was the case until the ‚Äònew evidence‚Äô cited by Burke is found.

Less than a week later the Evening News was effusive in its praise of Merlin's images of Hawkins Hill and twenty large views, one dozen lesser views, and sixty smaller photographs of every scene of interest as well as the principle machinery at work. The whole series made up a valuable portrayal of the extensive mining operations at the locations. ‚ÄòPhotographs of Hill End and Hawkins‚Äô Hill‚Äô, Evening News, (7 May 1872), 2 The Evening News also made it clear how unique Merlin's enterprise was, While many of the shots were taken of the buildings and streets others taken in the goldfields themselves required a great deal more effort. One of these, depicting the mines at Hawkins Hill, was reproduced in the Town and Country Journal on 18 May 1872, where the journalist, possibly Merlin himself, describes how the photograph was only possible after erecting a series of stages in the highest trees above the thousand foot deep gully. The camera and photographer then climbed up to the stage to photograph the mines nearly two miles away on the other side of the gully.‚ÄòSaturday, 16 November‚Äô, The Armidale Express and New England General Advertiser, (16 November 1872), 4  Holtermann Exposition  Atalante in the Fitzroy Dock, Sydney Harbour, 1873, by Beaufoy MerlinBy 1872 The Star of Hope Gold Mining Company was mining one of the richest veins of gold in Hawkins Hill and this had made its manager, Bernard Holtermann, very wealthy. Merlin and Holtermann's relationship came to the fore when the largest piece of reef-gold in the world was discovered in the Star of Hope mine on 19 October 1872.The largest specimen of reef gold in the world, Hill End State Library of New South Wales, ON 4 Box 13 No [1] Holtermann approached Merlin, who photographed it before it was sent to the crusher and took several photographs of Holtermann and his partner Beyer. Then on 30 October, Merlin wrote a long biographical article praising Holtermann's hard work and persistence, which had kept the mine running in the years before they struck gold.‚ÄòHawkins‚Äô Hill‚Äô, Australian Town and Country Journal, (18 May 1872), 16.

By the end of December, Holtermann had left the Hill End to set himself up in his new home on the North Shore of Sydney. It was also around this time that Merlin seems to have inspired Holtermann to start a new project.Holtermann, ‚ÄòBiographical Note‚Äô, Holtermann Papers, State Library of New South Wales, ZML MSS 968 item 1 On 1 January 1873 a number of advertisements appeared in papers across the country describing Holtermann's new and ambitious scheme to promote Australia's industrial resources and to seek submissions from interested parties before the proposed opening in eight months time. Beaufoy Merlin, ‚ÄòAdvertising‚Äô, The Sydney Morning Herald, (3 January 1873), 1 Holtermann engaged Merlin to take panoramas and views of all the towns and gold-fields in the colonies which would then be used to create albums of each town and gold-field, containing statistical information and other valuable matter. These photographs were to be presented as large transparent pictures using a new process invented by Merlin.‚ÄòIntercolonial News‚Äô, The Queenslander, (18 January 1873), 9. As the year progressed Holtermann remained continued to support Merlin in his photographic endeavours. In March, the Governor of New South Wales, Hercules Robinson, visited Hill End and Merlin captured the banners strung across the street to welcome him.Clarke Street decorated for visit of Governor Sir Hercules Robinson, 11 March 1873, Hill End, State Library of New South Wales, ON 4 Box 9 No 18824 In April, Merlin was in Bathurst photographing the town for Holtermann.Unknown, ‚ÄòFrom Our Correspondents‚Äô, Empire, (5 April 1873), 2.

The positive transparencies were created by enlarging his original negatives and their size was noted by those that saw the early examples produced by Merlin.Unknown, ‚ÄòHoltermann's Exhibition‚Äô, Empire, (23 July 1873), 2.}} One reason for the coverage in the news may have been due to a deputation of the New South Wales Commissioners for the International Exhibition, who were meeting with the Colonial Secretary to discuss setting up a permanent exhibition building in London. This proposal fell through, even though it was potentially a good fit for Holtermann's Exposition collection.Unknown, ‚ÄòSocial‚Äô, Empire, (9 August 1873), 5.

Regardless of these setbacks, Merlin worked with his normal diligence preparing his collections for the Exposition without knowing when they would finally open.Geoff Barker Henry Beaufoy Merlin Showman and Photographer, 2018 His primary focus continued to be the work for Holtermann but he also found time to write journalistic articles for the papers. In August 1873 he produced a series of articles on the recent discoveries made by the expedition of HMS Basilisk to New Guinea.Merlin, ‚ÄòRecent Discoveries in New Guinea‚Äô, Empire, (14 August 1873), 4. At the same time, he continued with his photographic work and his image of the French warship Atalante at Fitzroy Dock on Cockatoo Island, Sydney, is one Merlin himself acknowledged as among his best works.Merlin, \\"The French Ironclad\\", Australian Town and Country Journal, (23 August 1873), 242. Soon after this, Merlin left Sydney to photograph the townships of Orange and Dubbo. His account of this journey, which appeared in the Town and Country Journal, praised the people and the climate and reads almost like a caption for one of the proposed album of views for Holtermann's Exposition.Merlin, ‚ÄòFrom Orange to Dubbo‚Äô, Australian Town and Country Journal, (27 September 1873), 10.  Death  On 27 September 1873 Merlin died after a very short illness at his home in Little Abercrombie Street, Leichhardt, Sydney.

Intertrial priming occurs when a target feature (the characteristic that distinguishes targets from non- targets) is repeated from one trial to the next, and typically results in speeded response times to the target. A target is the stimulus participants are required to search for. For example, intertrial priming occurs when the task is to respond to either a red or a green target, and the response time to a red target is faster if the preceding trial also has a red target.  Top- down and bottom-up attention  Visual attention is influenced by top down and bottom up attentional processes. Top-down attention is allocated based on an observer's current knowledge about the stimuli. Participants in an experiment might be instructed to search for, and respond to a target object presented in a display that is a different colour than the other objects presented simultaneously. Top down knowledge of the dimension of the target (i.e. colour) can speed response times to target identification. Bottom-up attention is involuntarily and automatically directed towards salient features in the environment such as a bright colour among dull colours. In experimental settings, the more different a stimulus is from other stimuli in a visual display, the more salient it is. Bottom-up attention is typically not guided by observers' goals or knowledge, only by the physical properties of the stimuli. Many studies employ various methods involving intertrial priming to assess the contribution of top down versus bottom up processes in guiding attention in visual search tasks. = Integrative framework = There are factors in visual search tasks that the top down versus bottom up dichotomy does not take into consideration. Not all selection biases can be explained by physical saliency (bottom up) or observer goals (top down). Studies that have found that stimuli that are equally salient and are connected with rewards and can draw a participants' attention, even if this choice doesn't match their selection goals. An alternative framework has been proposed where past selection history, current goals and physical salience are integrated in a model of attentional control.  Measuring the effects of intertrial priming  Intertrial priming is an important aspect to consider in designing an experiment as it can influence the results if it is not considered/controlled. Intertrial priming is often measured using a visual search task. A typical visual search task involves participants searching for, and responding to, a target amongst a group of non-target items. Intertrial priming performance is generally measured by recording participants' reaction times to identify a target and comparing these times across trials. Different trial designs and visual search tasks can be employed to measure intertrial priming. = Blocked and mixed trials = Studies often compare blocked and mixed visual search trials to measure intertrial priming. Blocked trials are multiple, successively presented visual search trials that include the same target, and mixed trials are a randomised series of trials, each trial consisting of different targets. For example, a blocked trial condition may include searching for a green circle in trial 1, and in multiple successive preceding trials, whereas a mixed trial condition may include searching a for a green circle in trial 1, but a red circle in the proceeding trials. Blocking trials can control for effects of variability in targets. When a target with the same defining feature is repeated across trials (blocked conditions), participants reaction times are faster than when the target is not the same across trials (mixed conditions). This repetition effect is also cumulative. As the number of target repetitions increases, up to a certain point, participants reaction times are faster each time they are exposed to the same target in repeated trials. In mixed and blocked trials there can be a disparity in intertrial priming that results in faster reaction times in the blocked trials. Reaction times may be faster in blocked trials because participants are required to respond to targets that differ in only one dimension from non-targets. = Cueing = A cue is a presentation of a stimulus prior to a trial to inform the participant of an upcoming target feature. For example, a blue circle may be shown before a trial to signify a blue circle will be the target in the upcoming trial. Target relevant cues may be presented to participants to decrease their reaction time to the target in the display. These cues may be valid or invalid. Valid cues correctly predict the target stimulus but invalid cues do not. For example, if the target in an upcoming trial is a blue circle, a blue circle presented as a cue would be valid, but if a red circle was presented as a cue it would be invalid, as it doesn't correctly predict the blue circle target stimulus. Reaction times to valid cues are typically faster than reaction times to invalid cues. This phenomenon is known as a cueing effect. = Cue validity effect = When a valid cue has a low probability of correct target prediction, there can still be a reliable cueing effect for valid cues, and faster reaction times to valid cues than invalid cues. This suggests that the cueing effect is not affected by the predictive nature of the cue, and may not be due to top-down control. If top-down control is involved in the response selection then invalid trials should have a faster response than valid trials because participants are aware that the likelihood of being presented with a valid trial is very low.  Types of visual search  = Pop-out search = Pop-out search tasks include a target that differs in one dimension from a group of homogeneous non-target items. A dimension is a categorical feature of a stimulus such as its colour (i.e. a red target among green non-targets), its shape (a square target among circle non-targets) or its orientation (a vertically presented target among horizontal non- targets). Response times in pop-out searches are generally faster to targets when the colour of both targets and distractors remains the same throughout trials, and slower when these colours are switched during trials. = Conjunctive search = A conjunctive search involves non-target stimuli that have more than one dimension in common with the target stimulus. For example, when a target is a green circle in a conjunctive search, non-targets (distractors) could be red circles and green squares. The target will share one dimension in common with one set of non-targets (i.e. shape) and another dimension in common with the other non-target group (i.e. colour). If target and distractor features are the same over consecutive trials, response times are faster than when these dimensions are not repeated.  Why it occurs (major theories)  = Dimension-weighting account theory = The \\"dimension- weighting account\\" of visual selection states that there is a limit to the attentional weight that can be allocated to a particular dimension of an object at any one time. The dimensions of stimuli perceived as important to an observer are allocated more attentional weight (i.e. a target in a visual search), resulting in faster detection times. If a target dimension is known in advance, this can increase the saliency signals of the target. On the other hand, if the target dimension is unknown, attentional weight has to be shifted to the target dimension. When target dimensions remain the same across trials there is no change in attentional weight required, resulting in faster reaction times (intertrial facilitation). = Priming of pop-out hypothesis = The priming of pop-out hypothesis suggests performance in a visual search task involving a pop-out target can be affected by the search history of specific target features in previous trials. If target and distractor features are repeated in subsequent trials, reaction times will be faster than if these features change across trials. The hypothesis proposes the repetition of a target used in a preceding trial makes its pop-out features more salient to an observer and therefore increases the likelihood the observer will attend to it. = Episodic retrieval hypothesis = The episodic retrieval model suggests reduced response times in intertrial priming are due to the observers' retrieval of episodic memories relevant to the task. The hypothesis states that visual search is composed of three successive stages of processing: # search for a target, # decide if the chosen target is the target of interest, and # select and respond to the chosen target. This hypothesis argues that when a target presented in a previous trial is presented again in the current trial, processing of the target is accelerated in the target decision stage of the model, so that after identification the target is verified to assess whether it matches the previous target stored in episodic memory. = Perceptual grouping of distractors account = Many theories focus on the repetition of target features as dominant explanation for the repetition effects seen in intertrial priming. If target features are the same over consecutive trials but distractor features are changed, response times are not as fast as if both target and distractor features are kept constant over trials. This suggests that intertrial priming may mainly be due to distractor feature repetition, and target feature repetition influences this only slightly. This distractor-based priming may be due to faster perceptual grouping of distractors across trials. Perceptual grouping of distractors allows the target presence or absence to be distinguished more quickly. However, the repetition of target defining features cannot be excluded as a contributor to the priming effect found in conjunctive searches.

These highways were constructed, maintained, or funded by the Maryland State Roads Commission or Maryland State Highway Administration and assigned a unique or temporally unique number. Some time after the highway was assigned, the highway was transferred to county or municipal maintenance and the number designation was removed from the particular stretch of road. In some cases, a highway was renumbered in whole or in part. This list contains all or most of the state-numbered highways between 400 and 499 that have existed since highways were first numbered in 1927 but are no longer part of the state highway system or are state highways of a different number. Most former state highways have not had their numbers reused. However, many state highway numbers were used for a former highway and are currently in use. Some numbers have been used three times. The former highways below whose numbers are used presently, those that were taken over in whole or in part by another highway, or have enough information to warrant a separate article contain links to those separate highway articles. Highway numbers that have two or more former uses are differentiated below by year ranges. This list does not include former Interstate or U.S. Highways, which are linked from their respective lists.  MD 400 Maryland Route 400 was the designation for Mount Wilson Lane, which ran from MD 140 west to the Western Maryland Railway (now CSX's Hanover Subdivision) and the former Mount Wilson Hospital Center near Garrison in western Baltimore County. The highway was paved as a concrete road in 1930. MD 400 was removed from the state highway system in 1991. MD 401 Maryland Route 401 was the designation for Stringtown Road from MD 25 east to Yeoho Road near Butler in northern Baltimore County. The highway was constructed as a macadam road in two segments in 1932 and 1933. MD 401 was removed from the state highway system in 1987. MD 403 Maryland Route 403 was the designation for what was then named Colesville Road, which ran from MD 500 in Hyattsville east to US 1 in Riverdale in northern Prince George's County. Colesville Road was constructed as a modern highway between 1940 and 1942. MD 403 was resurfaced in 1954, shortly before the highway was taken over by MD 410 when that highway's modern alignment through Hyattsville was completed in 1956. MD 403 (1930) Maryland Route 403 was the designation for a loop off of MD 155 west of MD 161 via Level Village Road. It was deleted by 1942. It appears on a 1937 map and a Maryland SRC operating budget. MD 406 Maryland Route 406 was the designation for Rehobeth Road from MD 667 at Hudson Corner east to US 13 in West Pocomoke in southern Somerset County. The first section of MD 406 was completed east from what was then MD 413 in 1930. MD 406 was taken over by MD 667 when that highway's terminus was shifted from Westover to West Pocomoke in 1961. MD 408 Maryland Route 408 was the designation for Edgewood Road from the Edgewood Arsenal (now part of Aberdeen Proving Ground) north to MD 7 in Edgewood in southern Harford County. The highway was built as a concrete road south from US 40 (now MD 7) in the community of Van Bibber south to the military installation in 1930. MD 408 was constructed with a width of but was proposed for widening to as early as 1934. The highway received an underpass of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision) and approaches to the grade separation in 1939. MD 24 assumed all of MD 408 when MD 24 was extended south from MD 7 to Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1952. Much of what had been MD 408 is now part of MD 755. MD 409 Maryland Route 409 was the designation for Freeland Road from the Northern Central Railway at Freeland to east of I-83 at Maryland Line in far northern Baltimore County. The highway was constructed as a concrete road from Freeland to US 111 (now MD 45) in 1929 and 1930. MD 409 was extended east through the I-83 interchange after the freeway was built between Parkton and the Pennsylvania state line in 1958 and 1959. The highway was removed from the state highway system in 1991. MD 411 Maryland Route 411 was the designation for Rhode Island Avenue from former MD 206 (now MD 208, which follows 38th Street) in Brentwood east to US 1 (now US 1 Alternate) in Hyattsville in northern Prince George's County. The portion of Rhode Island Avenue from the District of Columbia east to 38th Street was built as a concrete road as part of MD 206 between 1916 and 1919. The remainder of MD 206 along 38th Street to Cottage City is now part of MD 208. MD 411 was constructed as a concrete road in 1929 and 1930 from Brentwood to Hyattsville. By 1934, the highway was proposed to be expanded to because it carried an average of 19,105 vehicles per day. MD 411 was widened to from Brentwood to Hyattsville between 1938 and 1940. The MD 411 designation may have been extended west from 38th Street to the District boundary by 1939. Rhode Island Avenue also may have been part of US 1 Alternate and US 50 Alternate; US 1 and US 50 then entered the city along Bladensburg Road. The MD 411 designation was removed when US 1 was placed on Rhode Island Avenue from Washington, D.C., to Hyattsville by 1946; old US 1 along Baltimore Avenue and Bladensburg Road became US 1 Alternate. MD 412 Maryland Route 412 was the designation for Riverdale Road from US 1 east to MD 201 in Riverdale. The highway was constructed as a concrete road in 1929 and 1930. At the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, MD 412 used one-block portions of Rhode Island Avenue, Queensbury Road, and Lafayette Avenue to connect with the segments of Riverdale Road on either side of the tracks. However, by 1956, the highway used Queensbury Road west to US 1 in the 1950s before reverting to Riverdale Road around 1963. The highway was truncated on the east side of the railroad in 1978. MD 412 was removed from the state highway system in 1991. MD 415 Maryland Route 415 was the designation for Scotland Beach Road from MD 5 east to the Chesapeake Bay shore near Scotland in far southern St. Mary's County. The highway was constructed as a gravel road in 1930. MD 415 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. MD 416 Maryland Route 416 was the designation for Southern Maryland Boulevard from MD 2 in Sunderland north to MD 4 at Waysons Corner in northern Calvert County and southern Anne Arundel County. Southern Maryland Boulevard was constructed as an concrete road on a new alignment in 1929 and 1930. MD 416 was widened to along its whole length and resurfaced in 1948. The highway was relocated at Lyons Creek at the county line between 1953 and 1956. MD 416 was expanded to a divided highway from Waysons Corner to south of Lyons Creek in 1962 concurrent with the construction of MD 4's bypass of Upper Marlboro. In 1960, MD 416 was extended south from Sunderland on a long concurrency with MD 2 to the latter highway's terminus at Solomons. In 1965, MD 416 was replaced by MD 4 from Waysons Corner to Solomons; the portion of MD 4 east of Waysons Corner became MD 408. MD 417 Maryland Route 417 was the designation for Springs Road from US 40 (now US 40 Alternate north to the Pennsylvania state line in Grantsville in northern Garrett County. The highway went under construction in 1930 and was completed as a concrete road by 1933. MD 417 was replaced by MD 669 to match the adjacent Pennsylvania Route 669 in 1963. MD 419 Maryland Route 419 was the designation for a pair of highways near Dickerson in western Montgomery County. One highway followed Mount Ephraim Road from MD 28 at Dickerson north to near the intersection of Mount Ephraim Road and Sugarloaf Mountain Road. The other used Martinsburg Road from MD 28 south to where Martinsburg Road curves south near the Potomac River. Both segments of MD 419 were constructed in two sections. The northern MD 419 was constructed as a concrete road from MD 28 to north of Barnesville Road in 1929 and 1930. The highway was extended to its northern terminus in 1931 and 1932. The southern MD 419 was built as a concrete road from MD 28 to near Wasche Road in 1929 and 1930. The highway was extended as a macadam road to where Martinsburg Road bends south near the Potomac River in 1931 and 1932. Both segments of MD 419 were removed from the state highway system in 1959. MD 420 Maryland Route 420 was the designation for Brink Road from Goshen Road east to MD 108 in Laytonsville and Sundown Road from MD 108 east to a spot east of Laytonsville in northern Montgomery County. The portion of the highway between MD 124 and MD 108 was constructed in concrete as part of MD 124 between 1925 and 1927. MD 420 was built as a concrete road from MD 124 west to Goshen Road in 1929 and 1930. The section of the highway east of MD 108 was paved in 1939 and designated MD 701. MD 701 was replaced by MD 420 in 1952. In 1959, MD 124 was moved to its present alignment, replacing its old course along Warfield Road, Laytonsville Road, and Brink Road. MD 420 replaced MD 124 along Brink Road; at the same time, the portion of MD 420 between MD 124 and Goshen Road was transferred to county maintenance. The remainder of MD 420 was removed from the state highway system in 1974. MD 421 Maryland Route 421 was the designation for Travilah Road from MD 190 north to Glen Road near Travilah in southwestern Montgomery County. The highway was paved as a macadam road in 1929 and 1930. MD 421 was removed from the state highway system in 1959. MD 426 Maryland Route 426 was the designation for Liverpool Point Road from the Potomac River east to MD 6 in Nanjemoy in western Charles County. The highway was constructed was a gravel road in two sections. The first was built from Nanjemoy, then known as Cross Road, west toward Liverpool starting in 1930. The route was extended to the Potomac River in 1933. MD 426 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. MD 427 Maryland Route 427 was the designation for Chapel Point Road, which ran from the Port Tobacco River in Chapel Point State Park east to US 301 at Bel Alton in southern Charles County. The highway was constructed was a gravel road in two sections. The first was built from Bel Alton west toward Chapel Point starting in 1930. The route was completed to Chapel Point in 1933. MD 427 was removed from the state highway system in 1989. MD 428 Maryland Route 428 was the designation for Penns Hill Road, which ran from MD 234 near Newport north to MD 6 in Dentsville in southern Charles County. The highway was built as a gravel road in three sections. The first section of MD 428 started construction at the Newport end in 1930. The second section was completed in 1933. The highway was completed from Newport to Dentsville in 1936. MD 428 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. MD 429 Maryland Route 429 was the designation for Popes Creek Road, which ran from Popes Creek on the Potomac River north to US 301 at Faulkner in southern Charles County.

The highway from Chestertown to Morgnec and from Kennedyville Roadwhich was MD 448to Chesterville was constructed in 1929 and 1930. The gap between Morgnec and Kennedyville Road was filled between 1930 and 1933. Through a May 14, 1958, road transfer agreement, the county agreed to accept the portion of MD 447 from Morgnec to Chesterville after the state completed constructed on River Road as a westward extension of MD 291 from MD 290 south of Chesterville.

Macy. The film had its world premiere at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on 21 May 2016 and was released on 12 August 2016, by Lionsgate Premiere. Plot A young woman named Lydia buys ammunition at a megastore for her boyfriend Jonah Pincerna and his gang. After loading up, the gang goes to kill a tenant family who apparently stole money the gang had stashed in the walls of their rented house. After killing a tenant, Jonah ties up another and presses Lydia to kill her. However, Lydia accidentally shoots Jonah in the neck, apparently killing him, and escapes the crime scene. She contacts her estranged father, John Link, an ex-convict and recovering alcoholic out on parole after serving seven years in prison. He picks up Lydia, takes her back to his trailer house, and learns that she is both a drug addict and an alcoholic. Some days pass by uneventfully, although Lydia receives death threat text messages from the gang members. One night, members of Jonah's gang come to John's house. After failing to force themselves in, they open fire on the house and ram it with their SUV. John's neighbor and sponsor, Kirby, and other armed residents rush to intervene, and the gang retreats. Reasoning that giving Lydia up to the police will put her in danger, John flees with her. Lydia tells John about her life after running away from home and about Jonah, who turns out to be a well-connected member of a Mexican drug cartel. The two rest at a motel, where Lydia learns they have been linked to the tenants' deaths. They narrowly escape the police and a sicario (hitman) sent by the cartel. John attempts to request a favor from his former mentor and friend, Preacher, who makes a living by collecting and selling war memorabilia. Preacher agrees to help but changes his mind after learning of the reward for turning in Lydia. John overpowers Preacher and his wife, and escapes with Lydia on a 1997 Harley Softail motorcycle. They are pursued by two of Preacher's men, who are both killed in the chase. John travels to a prison where he meets Arturo, his former cellmate, to ask about Jonah's connections. He learns that Jonah himself stole the money from his cartel, blamed the tenants, and then murdered them to cover his tracks. At the motel alone, Lydia receives a call from Kirby, who says she is in danger and advises her to head to a crowded public place, like a theater. At the cinema, Lydia is confronted by Jonah, who had survived his injury and who, with help from his gang, abducts her. After leaving the prison, John calls Kirby, but Jonah answers the phone, reveals that he has captured Kirby, and kills him. John warns Jonah against harming Lydia, citing his knowledge of Jonah's connections and bad standing with his family. John offers up his life for his daughter, and Jonah arranges to meet at a secluded spot in the desert. John goes back to Preacher's place, and picks up a landmine and some grenades and kills Preacher. He arrives at the meeting spot, and improvises a booby trap with his bike and the landmine. Jonah's men tie John up and put him in a car. As they prepare to leave, two of Jonah's men are killed by the trap. John kills the gang member inside the vehicle, but Jonah escapes. The sicario, having taken position at a vantage point, wounds John. Taking cover behind a car, John forces the sicario to get closer, and the two fatally shoot each other. John dies after telling his daughter she is a good girl. Jonah is arrested and incarcerated. While sitting down at a table, he's met by a visibly hostile gang led by Arturo, who smiles knowingly, implying that Jonah will be killed. One year later, in a support group, Lydia reveals that she has been sober for a year and expresses gratitude for her father.

History Bluffton was founded as a mining community in 1888. In 1890, Bluffton was home to approximately 8,000 residents. The Bluffton Land, Ore and Furnace Company operated an iron mine in the area, and was also responsible for building the Signal Hotel, which at one point hosted Rudyard Kipling. The Signal Hotel was the first structure in Cherokee County with electric lights. Bluffton had one newspaper, the Bluffton Mascot, and was home to a Methodist Episcopal church and Salem Baptist Church, which is still in use today. Bluffton was also the planned site of a college, The University of the Southland. A groundbreaking took place on April 24, 1889, but the college was never built. Besides the iron mines, Bluffton was home to a water works system, school, post office, and Cherokee County's first electrical generating plant. Even so, Bluffton's ore fields did not meet the expectations of their investors and higher grade iron was available closer to Birmingham. Commercial businesses began to fail, and Bluffton soon came to be considered a ghost town. A post office was operated in Bluffton from 1888 to 1934.

After the release of their Pleasure EP ( came out in December 2013) , peek-a-boo magazine described their work as: The music from Laslo Antal and Lidija Andonov sounds indeed very 80‚Äôs, but at the same time contemporary as well. I know, they‚Äôre not the first who are doing such things‚Ä¶The only thing is that it often feels like Sixth June are just a bit better than the others, just like if their songs are classics themselves‚Ä¶. Indestructible monuments on their own. Yeah, I really use such big words. After hearing their brand new 5 tracks 12 EP Pleasure, I feel like to use these words again....http://www.peek-a-boo-magazine.be/en/reviews/sixth-june- pleasure-ep/  Name and influences  Sixth June's band name has no concrete reference to June 6 in history. Their music is strongly influenced by 1980s Dark culture bands and their albums, like Seventeen Seconds (The Cure, 1980), Music for the Masses (Depeche Mode, 1987), Dead Can Dance (1984), Mask (Bauhaus, 1981). Formative is Lidija Andonov's warm melancholic voice.http://image.issuu.com/130930131407-6cb002ba9259a85322ebee030993199f/jpg/page_6.jpg  Discography  Everytime (2010) ‚Äì Genetic Music / No Emb Blanc * Back For A Day, EP (2011) ‚Äì Mannequin Records * Pleasure, 12\\" (2013) ‚Äì Mannequin Records * Virgo Rising (2017) - aufnahme+wiedergabe * Without a sign (demos and unrealeased tracks, 2018) - aufnahme+wiedergabe * Trust (2020) - The State51 Conspiracy  Videos  Everytime (2007, in Novi Sad) * Oh No it's Burning (2008, in Subotica) * Come Closer (2011, in Berlin) * Back for a day (2011, in Berlin) * Drowning (2014) * Night before (2017) * Call me, II (2018)  References   External links  Official Site * Official Facebook * Noisey Interview: Sixth June Are Twisting History, Vice magazine, December 2013 (in german) * Laslo Antal website * Samples of debut Everytime (mp3), No Emb Blanc * Label info, Mannequin Records Minimal music Musical groups established in 2007 German synthpop groups Musical groups from Berlin Serbian pop music groups Musical groups from Belgrade ","title":"Sixth June"},{"id":"42979566","title":"Jonny Bogris"},{"id":"42979617","text":"The Zombie Horror Picture Show is the first concert film by American musician Rob Zombie, released May 19, 2014 on DVD and Blu-ray.

Early life  McCready is the youngest of four children, and the son of an Irish wharf worker. He is the only member of his family to have educational qualifications.  Career  Among other things, McCready has worked as an engineer in the Royal New Zealand Air Force, as a computer technician for a Canadian airline, and as a clerk at Wellington City Council.  Private prosecutions  = Trevor Mallard prosecution = In November 2007 he took a private prosecution against Labour Party MP Trevor Mallard for fighting in a public place. The prosecution arose after Mallard had a fight with National Party MP Tau Henare in Parliament. Mallard eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of fighting in a public place and was ordered to donate $500 to charity. McCready said he was happy with the outcome. He has reportedly been described by Helen Clark as \\"a small-minded malicious person\\". = John Banks prosecution = McCready took a private prosecution against ACT Party MP John Banks over filing a false electoral return in the 2010 Auckland mayoral election, after the New Zealand police decided there wasn't sufficient evidence to prosecute Banks. McCready's prosecution was taken over by the Crown before it went to trial. In June 2014, Banks was found guilty by a judge of filing a false electoral return. McCready said he was ecstatic with the outcome. He said that he pursued Banks as a matter of principle, because he believes that everyone in a democracy should be accountable for their actions. In February 2014, before the outcome of the case was known, McCready applied to the court for $10,000‚Äì$20,000 in costs for almost a year's work on the case. He wanted either Banks or the Crown to pay the bill, with the proceeds going to himself and charity. In June 2014, McCready filed further charges in relation to the Banks case, this time targeting Prime Minister John Key, a police officer, and Banks again. His contention is that Key \\"conspired to defeat the course of justice by ensuring Banks was not prosecuted by the police\\" and that he was an accessory by being wilfully blind to the contents of the police report. McCready rejected suggestions that his prosecutions were a waste of time, saying \\"that's what the courts are there for. I'm not a serial litigant, I'm New Zealand's private prosecutor who is representing the public\\". In November 2014, the Court of Appeal set aside the original guilty verdict and ordered a retrial. The reason for the verdict being set aside was due to new evidence being made aware to the court regarding the money under question. A retrial date had been set for July 2015 but the case was ultimately quashed by the Court of Appeal on 19 May 2015 when it was revealed a memorandum setting out evidence by some witnesses was subsequently contradicted by themselves had been held back from Banks' legal team and that this evidence meant the new trial was untenable. = John Key and others = In July 2014, McCready filed a private prosecution in Auckland's District Court. Court documents name 10 defendants and 22 proposed charges. The defendants include Prime Minister John Key, as well as four police officers including Detective Inspector Mark Benefield, a QC, and a judicial officer. = Other prosecutions = In December 2013, McCready announced that he was planning a private prosecution for manslaughter against former head of Pike River Mine Peter Whitall. He planned to go ahead with the prosecution after talking to the families of the mine workers who died in the Pike River Mine disaster. In February 2013, McCready set up a private prosecution service called the New Zealand Private Prosecution Service, which he intended to be a watchdog for consumers.  Convictions  In 2006, McCready was sentenced to 75 hours community service after he traded while bankrupt. In 2009, McCready was convicted on charges on charges of making false tax returns involving $183,155. He was sentenced to six months' home detention. In 2013, McCready was convicted of blackmailing a company director and sentenced to six months' community detention. He wrote in an apology to the victim that: \\"My conduct was criminal, unnecessary, and I am sure caused you some considerable distress.\\" Although he escaped jail time, he was unable to pay the court costs and as a consequence was bankrupted.  Involvement in local government  In the Wellington 2013 local government elections, McCready stood as an independent candidate for the Eastern Ward. His campaign centred on extending Wellington airport's runway, upgrading council housing, and extending free public transport for Super Gold card holders. He was not elected, receiving 239 votes.  Personal life  While working at the Wellington City Council he claimed to have developed chronic occupational overuse syndrome. He has been on a benefit since 1995, and lives in a council-subsidised flat in Miramar. McCready has two daughters. He is a reformed alcoholic.

He was professor of mycology at Cornell. He is known for his work on the Phycomycetes. His book on the Lower Fungi was the standard text and reference work on the Phycomycetes. He trained Clark Thomas Rogerson and Richard P. Korf, two prominent mycologists.  Biography  Harry Morton Fitzpatrick was born on June 27, 1886, in Greenwood, Indiana. He attended high school in Crawfordsville, Indiana, where he became acquainted with mycologist Herbert Hice Whetzel, then a student at Wabash College, who stimulated his interest in mycology. In 1905, he entered Wabash College, where Professor Mason B. Thomas, a great teacher of botany, would further influence Fitzpatrick to study mycology. Encouraged by Whetzel, then Professor at Cornell University, and aided by Professor Thomas, he transferred to Cornell in 1908 as an assistant to Professor George Francis Atkinson in the Department of Botany and received the A.B. degree from the Arts College in 1909. He then entered the Graduate School at Cornell as an Assistant and later as an Instructor in Plant Pathology. He studied mycology under Professor Atkinson. He was awarded the Ph.D. degree in 1913. He was immediately appointed Assistant Professor by Whetzel in the recently organized Department of Plant Pathology at Cornell, and began the work of teaching mycology to which he devoted the remainder of his life. He was raised to a full Professorship in 1922. Harry Morton Fitzpatrick died in Ithaca, New York on December 8, 1949.  Mycological contributions Harry Morton Fitzpatrick's contributions to mycology include monographs of the Coryneliaceae and Nitschkiaceae. Fitzpatrick is best known for his influential text The Lower Fungi. Phycomycetes, which was published in 1930, and is credited for the posthumous publication of Whetzel's 1945 monograph of the Sclerotineaceae. Fitzpatrick took an active role in the founding of the Mycological Society of America (MSA) at New Orleans, Louisiana on December 29, 1931. Fitzpatrick served as the first Secretary-Treasurer of the MSA (1932‚Äì1935), as the fifth President of the MSA (1936), and as Historian of the MSA until his death.

He helped negotiate the release of Gary Powers in 1962 and over 1,000 prisoners captured during the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion. After retiring from the CIA, Miskovsky worked for multiple federal agencies, including the Federal Maritime Commission and the Treasury Department. Following the 1967 Detroit riot, Miskovsky was appointed to lead an investigation into the cause of the unrest and interview civil rights leaders for the Kerner Commission. His report ultimately concluded that America was becoming divided into two separate societies based on skin color, and that the societies were inherently unequal. Miskovsky would later serve as the director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the general counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. He helped to establish the Archdiocesan Legal Network in 1989 and worked in private practice from 1981 until his retirement in 2003. Early life Miskovsky was born on May 11, 1926 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Jaroslav Miskovsky, an immigrant from Czechoslovakia, and Ruth Miskovsky (nee Patera).\\"Illinois, Cook County, Birth Certificates, 1871-1940,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QKMW-CWSR : accessed 18 October 2015), Milan Carl Miskovsky, 11 May 1926; citing Chicago, Cook, Illinois, United States, reference/certificate 20841, Cook County Courthouse, Chicago; FHL microfilm . He grew up during the Great Depression, but his family did not suffer significant economic harm. Miskovsky's father was heavily involved in Chicago politics, and Miskovsky would frequently help him deliver food and clothes to people unable to afford them. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1949 and worked for the U.S. Forest Service for the next two years. He was reassigned to Washington, D.C. in 1951, where he was hired by the CIA to investigate forests of the Eastern Bloc. In 1956, Miskovsky obtained a law degree from the George Washington University Law School. He joined the legal office of the CIA, and was eventually promoted to the rank of assistant general counsel.Bigger, p. 256. U-2 incident In 1960, the Soviet Union shot down a United States U-2 spy plane. The Soviets captured its pilot, Gary Powers, and tried him for committing espionage against the Soviet Union. At first, the United States believed that Powers could be freed by crafting an argument regarding international principles. To this end, Miskovsky and two other lawyers (Alexander W. Parker and Frank Rogers) wrote a brief stating that Power's U-2 plane did not violate Soviet airspace any more than Sputnik violated American airspace. However, the Soviet Union refused to allow foreigners to defend Powers. Powers was ultimately defended by a lawyer who acted as a spokesman for the Soviet government.Bigger, p. 91. The Soviets ultimately sentenced Powers to a decade in prison. Working with lawyer James B. Donovan, Miskovsky negotiated with Soviet representatives. Eventually, they agreed upon a trade: Gary Powers would be released in exchange for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel held by the United States. Both sides agreed and Powers was released in 1962. Bay of Pigs invasion In April 1961, a 1,400-man force of Cuban exiles invaded Cuba in an attempt to end the regime of Fidel Castro. The invasion was a failure and two hundred of the exiles were killed while an additional 1,200 were captured. Miskovsky, working with lawyer and lead negotiator James Donovan, and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, negotiated a release for the prisoners in return for around fifty million dollars in medicine, food and other supplies. The captured Cubans were released days before Christmas. Later life Miskovsky left the CIA in 1964, and worked for the Federal Maritime Commission and the Treasury Department for four years. In 1967, Miskovsky was appointed to lead an investigation concerning the 1967 Detroit riot for the Kerner Commission. During the investigation, Miskovsky interviewed civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. Miskovsky's report concluded that the United States was transitioning into two separate societies, one black and the other white, and that the societies were inherently unequal. In 1968, Miskovsky was appointed the director of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization which gave legal aid to those whose civil liberties were violated. From 1977 to 1981, during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Miskovsky served as general counsel for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. From 1981 until his retirement in 2003, Miskovsky worked for Kirkland & Ellis, where he specialized in environmental law. In 1989, Miskovsky helped establish the Archdiocesan Legal Network, a free legal clinic run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington. The clinic aided people with non-criminal legal issues such as bankruptcy, evictions, suspended licenses or delayed social security checks. Miskovsky was originally tasked with recruiting other lawyers for the clinic, but was eventually promoted to chairmen of the clinic's board. Miskovsky died of lung cancer on October 15, 2009 in Washington, D.C. Personal life Miskovsky married Anne Miskovsky (nee Grogan), a fellow member of the Central Intelligence Agency, in 1952. The marriage lasted until 2004, when Anne Miskovsky died of leukemia. Miskovsky was a member of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown. In 1987, he and his wife served as the chairs of the Holy Trinity Parish bicentennial celebration.

The game is set on different planets, with players constructing robots to fight with and against others in battle. The game features contained garages in which players can build various functional vehicles with basic block-based parts, such as cubes and wheels, along with weapons that can be used for combat. The initial alpha build was released in March 2013, and gained over 300,000 players by the following year. It officially released out of beta on August 24, 2017. Gameplay Robocraft is a \\"build, drive, fight\\"robocraftgame.com game where players build their robots from building parts that can be bought for \\"Robits\\", the in game currency. Robits can be earned by fighting battles, where you earn more by destroying more enemies and capturing more mining points, or by selling building parts. Players have the option to play multiple game modes that offer different experiences, for example, Player Vs AI, Brawl and custom games. = Currency and Experience = Robocraft uses \\"Robits\\" as its currency. Robits are used to buy parts, which is called \\"Forging\\". They are earned by selling parts using the \\"Recycler\\" or playing matches. Before June 19, 2018, you could also get items from crates. After that date, they were removed and instead you get Robits only. The more Experience you get in a match, the more Robits you earn. Currently, you can not have a level above 10 000. = Building a Robot = The tech tree was added on June 19, 2018, this allows players to get the different parts that they want instead of them being randomly given parts via crates. Players are given the freedom to build and customize their robots in any way they like, as long as it does not exceed their in-game CPU limit (2000). The player's CPU limit does not increase as they level up. Different chassis and hardware blocks consume different amounts of CPU. The game also has a weapon energy system, which defines how long you can shoot with your weapons. Different weapons consume different amounts of energy per shot. After a bot passes 2000 CPU it becomes a Megabot, which can only join Custom Games and Play vs AI gamemodes. = Battle Variables = The game features a part-based damage model. To destroy a robot, 75% of the robot's total CPU must be destroyed. The damage model permits creativity and complex engineering in the areas of damage distribution and redirection. Robots have an automatic regeneration ability that slowly repair themselves after not being damaged for 10 seconds. If a robot is damaged while auto-repairing, the 10-second timer is reset and auto- reparating stops. also when a bot has just respawned it will have a shield surrounding it which negates any damage done to the bot until it wears off (usually 5 seconds) the said bot can use his movement, weapons and modules just as normal this respawn shield is made to discourage spawncamping It also features a \\"Speed boost\\" system, which improves a bot's stats depending on how it is built: movement parts will increase the speed boost depending on how used (for example if a bot uses 4 mega wheels the speed of the bot will be 12% higher) (this used to be a damage/health/speed boost system which increased the stats of a bot but it was removed on request of the community) = Gamemodes = Robocraft features seven game modes: * Test * AI Bots Deathmatch * Team Deathmatch * Battle Arena * Brawl * Custom Game Players can earn experience and robits in all game modes except Test and Custom Game. All multiplayer game modes are Ranked. Players earn ranking points from playing in multiplayer.  Test  The Test game mode is a simulation map with rugged terrain and flat platforms. The purpose of this game mode is for players to test their robots in the absence of other robots and objectives. No experience is earned while in this game mode.  Play VS AI  Play vs AI is the same as Team Deathmatch, except that all the other robots in your team and the robots in the other team are AI controlled  Battle Arena / League Arena  In Battle Arena, gameplay is much more complex. Robots respawn after being destroyed, each team's base has a Protonium Reactor, which harvests Protonium from Mining Points to load the Annihilator. A match is won when the Annihilator reaches 100%. The reactor is protected by a Fusion Shield. Players are healed by the Fusion Shield at their own base, which is impenetrable by enemy fire from the outside and inside. Throughout the map, there are three Mining Points which have to be captured to charge the Annihilator, Once a point is captured, the Reactor emits the Fusion Shield and is able to charge the annihilator, the more points you hold, the faster it charges. having all the mining points will disable that team's enemy Fusion Shield which allows players to attack the enemy reactor to reduce the energy it has and gain that same amount...if the mining points are held on to for period of time will result in \\"Dominating\\" the game, which increases charging rate to very high levels which might result into winning the game within a minute  Team Deathmatch  In this mode, two teams of 5 players fight with 5 second re- spawn times and a frag limit. The frag limit is 15, the game has a 10-minute timer, and if the timer runs out, the team with the highest score wins. If both teams have the same score, it goes into sudden death, where the team who destroys the next robot wins. Brawl Brawl Consists of several changes to rules and mechanics of other gamemodes, such as slower time, lowered damage, increased player counts and limitations as to what you can play with. Furthermore, the game mode can change as well along with rules. That can include the original Elimination mode, Team Deathmatch, Battle arena or Pit. These rules are changed every so often as to not be repetitive. Once a new Brawl has started, players get a 2XP bonus for their first victory. Custom Game Custom Games are customizable matches in which several mechanics can be changed or removed at will by the leader, as well as selecting maps and team sizes. It is constantly being improved and updated by the developers to add more freedom and options for a custom game. This is the only gamemode, along with Play vs AI and Test Mode, in which Megabots are allowed. = Weapons = There are several different weapons in the game, including *Laser (a machine-gun-like weapon, has two versions: front mounted and top mounted) *Plasma (fires a plasma grenade with an arc that explodes on impact) *Rail (A sniper-like weapon, fires a single high-damage shot with a very low rate of fire and high accuracy) *Nano (a healing gun with a short range that is incapable of dealing damage but in turn can heal teammates) *Tesla (a dangerous blade which heavily damages any bot it touches) *Aeroflak (An anti air gun that fires projectiles that Only explodes near flying bots and on hit the projectiles will deal more damage up to 20 times) *Proto-Seeker (fires many small, seeking projectiles that lock onto enemies at short range at a very high rate of fire) *LOML (after spending 2‚Äì3 seconds locking on, it fires seeking missiles that explode on impact, if losing lock on a target, the already launched missiles will continue to seek their target) *Ion (a shotgun- like cannon that deals massive damage in a short range) *Chain (a Gatling gun/minigun like weapon that spins up for a very high rate of fire) *Mortar (A short-range Plasma like cannon that cannot aim straight horizontally or vertically, acts like an artillery) Almost all weapons have multiple rarity variants, each having different stats, such as requiring more Weapon Energy, increased Damage, increased ROF, etc. There are also Modules (Disc Shield, Blink, Weapon Energy, Electromagnetic Pulse, Windowmaker, and Ghost Modules) which have certain abilities such as deploying a large temporary impenetrable Shield, traveling certain distances in less than a second, stunning all enemies in a radius, etc. = Social = Players can friend other players or add up to 4 other players to their platoon (regardless if they have premium or not) in order to play on the same team in the same match together. Players can also join Clans, a group of players with a maximum of 50, wherein players can cooperatively earn SXP (Season Experience) awarded at the end of a match which will then be converted into Robits at the end of the Clan Season. The Robits accumulated from the clan's TXP (Total Experience) will be distributed equally to clan members, albeit those who do not contribute in it in any way wouldn't receive any amount of Robits. Development Robocraft uses the Unity engine and Yahoo Games Network. = 2014 = A November 2014 update added EasyAntiCheat (EAC) software to the game's client, in order to counter various hacks such as zero reload time. Freejam has stated that the EAC team will focus on anti-cheating, allowing them to focus on new features. A major game update was released on December 9, 2014, adding Tank Tracks and Tesla Blades, a unique melee weapon, alongside several new features. = 2015 = On February 18, 2015, the \\"Dawn of the Megabots\\" update was released. This features a wide array of updates including new matching systems. \\"Megaboss\\" and \\"Challenge Mode\\", and rotor blades were introduced to let players construct \\"New helicopter style Copter Class Robots.\\" These were all introduced alongside many new updates. On April 30, 2015, \\"Respawned and Overclocked\\" was another large update, which completely changed the core gameplay. The robot-building remained unchanged, but the battles were given new mechanics, such as Protonium Crystals that must be destroyed instead of the previous goal of capturing the enemy base. Also added were Fusion Shields, SCU's, Fusion Towers, and Overclocking, as well as other changes such as rebalancing armor and healing. On June 24, 2015, the controversial update \\"Team Orders\\" was released. Most restrictions found in this update were later removed in Robocraft: Unleashed due to a heated response from the player community. A new ping system was added that allowed players to send messages to teammates on the map including: \\"On My Way\\", \\"Danger\\", and \\"Go Here\\". The current Surrender Vote, Leaver Penalty, and Battle Stats Screen were first implemented in this update. This update also reduced the number of towers in Battle Arena mode from 4 to 3, to \\"Give one team a constant advantage\\". On July 28, 2015, Robocraft: Unleashed was released. This update removed a variety of build and combat restrictions implemented in the Team Orders update. On August 27, 2015, Legends of the Pit became live. This update introduced the long-anticipated game mode \\"The Pit\\" currently only available in custom games. On September 24, 2015, the update Share, Drive, Fight became available to all players. This update included the Community Robot Factory, a place to buy, rent, and sell robots designed by users. A Single Player Mode was also introduced featuring AI enemy combatants. On December 17, 2015, the update Full Spectrum Combat was released. This was the first update to implement The Vision proposed by FreeJam on their forums. This update included an update to the Unity 5 game engine, the ability to paint cubes, and the collapse of all armor cubes to one type (replacing the original tier system). However, a variety of new armor cube shapes were introduced. In addition, up to 25 garage slots are now free for all users. Hotly debated on the forums was the removal of the Pilot seat, a notable design feature since the early days of Robocraft. The Megaseat was also converted to the Mega Module, and it is extinct from purchase forever, although players who had an existing inventory get a chance to keep it. = 2016 = On March 3, 2016 \\"Maximum Loadout\\" was released after being delayed for a week due to bug testing. The update introduces the ability to use multiple weapon types to be used on a single robot. In addition to this, the maximum pFLOP was increased to 1750 at Level 150. Firing weapons drain the power of your bot, which then regenerates over time, though it is possible to get a Weapon Energy Module which reduces this process from 10 seconds to 8. In addition to this, two new modules have been added to the game. The DSM or Disc Shield Module deploys a stationary shield, which can be fired through only by the team of the player that deployed it and has a long cooldown. In addition to this, the BLM, or Blink Module, will allow robots to warp forward a relatively long distance, at the expense of massive power consumption with short cooldown. On April 13, 2016 the update \\"Ghosts in the Machine\\" added the Ion Distorter, a futuristic shotgun, and the Ghost Module which allows invisibility at the expense of your power meter. On April 28, 2016 an update named \\"Epic Loot\\" switched currency and got rid of the tech tree, allowing players to buy any parts without needing to level up. Galaxy cash was removed too. The currency RP was switched to \\"Robits\\". This update also removed cube depots and introduced crates as one of the only two sources of parts in-game, the only other way to recycle weapons or other items into \\"Robits\\" and forge new weapons or items in the \\"cube forge\\". On June 1, 2016 \\"Battle for Earth\\" was released, adding a new map based in Birmingham, Earth. This map is based on a power station, which was \\"New and hi tec, yet old and abandoned\\", with a cooling tower in ruins in the centre. This map was exclusive to a new mode called \\"Team deathmatch\\", which replaced the old Team deathmatch, renamed to \\"Elimination\\". On June 26, 2016 \\"Aeroflak sentinel & power update\\" was released, adding a smaller version of the aeroflak, namely the \\"Aeroflak Sentinel\\" and changes were made to power usage. On July 14, 2016 \\"Enter the shredzone update\\" was released, adding a new mini-gun named \\"Chain Shredder\\" and a new module called \\"EMP Module\\" which disabled the enemy robots in a certain radius after it is activated for a certain time, when hit you can't move or shoot you weapons and the screen becomes less colorful. The effect lasts for 3 seconds. Diagonal rods, a new game mode called \\"AI Bots Death match\\" and a Tutorial were also added in this update. On August 4, 2016 \\"Strut Your Stuff\\" was released, adding Struts, better-protected aerorods, and a centre of mass feature. = 2017 = On May 4, 2017 \\"The Windowmaker update\\" was released, removing all radar accessories, moved all shields to the \\"special\\" category, and added a new module called the \\"Window maker module\\", allowing the players to detect all enemies within 7.5 seconds at the cost of some energy, currently the cheapest module ever. And a shrunken version of the Chain Shredder, the \\"Chain splitter\\", whom cheaper than its larger variant and also lighter. On August 24, 2017, the game went into full release with the drop of 1.0. This update removed Carbon 6 weapons, all cosmetics, and some building blocks from forge. Cosmetics can only be earned by receiving them in crates. People who were a part of beta got Pilot seats as a thank you reward. Depending on what year you joined leading up to 1.0, you got a set number of Pilot seats and Protonium crates. On September 19, 2017 the \\"Gyro Mortar\\" update was released. On November 19 the \\"Body Builder\\" update was released. =2019= On February 12 an update which add the calculation F=MA to the game to make building matter more where smaller and light builds turn quickly and accelerate quickly but harder to control but bigger and heavy builds will turn and accelerate more slowly but are easier to control which in turn can make a bot turn faster then its weapons or that the bot turns slower then the weapons do. This was introduced along with a Progression system where players can use their Robits to buy new bays or upgrade existing bays to hold bigger bots. When a new bay is used it will have 750 CPU form the start to allow room for a small bot but can be upgraded to hold a megabot (10,000 CPU). On March 7 an update was launched which introduced upgradable weapons which when used in battle will earn Exp or \\"Power\\" on their own. If the weapon's \\"power\\" bar is full it can be upgraded to deal more damage to up to 5 upgrades. Also along with this update all the multiplayer game-modes are ranked and a leader board was introduced to encourage players to play well. Along with this the max loadout was reduced from 5 to 3 slots. Monetization Robocraft is a free- to-play game where players can get to the end game \\"without even paying a cent\\". FreeJam operates on a \\"Pay To Progress Faster\\" model where in \\"Premium\\" memberships can be purchased which doubles the rate XP is earned. The developers often partner up with certain charities or companies to release \\"Bundles\\", which often come with cosmetics and the promoted company's logo on a \\"holo-flag\\". These bundles often come at a significant discount from how much it would cost to normally purchase the items. The addition of painting cubes has been controversial, as the colours available for free players are limited while other colors, previously available for free as tiered armour cubes, are now exclusive to Premium players, however new colours were promised for future updates. All premium players receive 3 times the recycle rate of parts. also Robocraft uses a Season rewards to which if you play you will gain rewards where players get 2 rows both rows have a Bar to display their progress which fills up while battling if the bar fills up fully they get the reward shown on the rewards rows where 1 row is free of charge but the 2nd row requires a Season pass to unlock References External links 2017 video games Free-to-play video games Indie video games Linux games Multiplayer and single-player video games MacOS games Video games developed in the United Kingdom Windows games Xbox One games Early access video games Unity (game engine) games ","title":"Robocraft"},{"id":"42979738","text":"Jaan Ki Baazi is a 1985 Hindi-language Indian feature film directed by Ajay Kashyap, starring Sanjay Dutt, Anita Raj, Anuradha Patel and Gulshan Grover in lead roles.

This disaster resulted in the deaths of hundreds of passengers.  Overview  Tampomas II, originally named Central No.6, was produced in 1971 by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Shimonoseki, Japan. It was a RoRo (Roll On-Roll Off) vessel of the screw-steamer type measuring 6153 GRT. The ship had a capacity of 1500 passengers, with a maximum speed of 19.5 knots. It had a width of 22 meters and a length of 128.6 meters. The ship was purchased by PT. PANN (Pengembangan Armada Niaga Nasional or National Commercial Fleet Development) from Comodo Marine Co. SA, Japan for US$8.3 million, and then PT. PELNI repurchased it from PT. PANN on a ten-year lease contract. Many were confused at the high price of this ship, because it was offered to other private liner companies for only US$3.6 million. Various parties, including Japan, stated that the ship was no longer seaworthy because it was already 25 years old at the time of the purchase. Once operated, this ship was directly assigned to serve the routes Jakarta-Padang and Jakarta-Ujung Pandang, which were the busiest routes at that time. Every time the ship made port, it was only given a four-hour break before sailing again. Repairs and routine maintenance on the ship's machinery and equipment was done in a perfunctory fashion considering its age. However, despite the substandard maintenance, the maiden voyage of Tampomas II was set for June 2 through June 13, 1980. A number of journalists and members of the House of Representatives were invited to join the voyage. On this cruise, several members of the House had witnessed and also questioned about the engine that often broke down during the trip. A Member of Parliament from the PDIP party, Ahmad Soebagyo, mentioned various irregularities during the cruise, including the ship was circling in the same radius due to the malfunctioning of its engine automatic regulator buttons and the cancellation of a show event on the ship due to a prolonged electrical failure. According to a reporter, the engine broke down six times during the trip.  The disaster  Tampomas II departed from Tanjung Priok harbor on Saturday, January 24, 1981 at 19:00 am, and was estimated to arrive in Ujung Pandang on Monday, January 26, 1981 at 10:00 pm. A pilot skipper mentioned that one of the ship's engines had broken down before leaving. The ship carried dozens of motor vehicles, including a SAKAI steam roller, Vespa scooters, etc., which were parked in the car deck. The manifest mentioned 200 motor cars, 1055 registered passengers and 82 crew members on board. The estimated total passengers, including stowaways, was 1442. Around 20:00 on January 25, in stormy weather, some parts of the engine experienced fuel leaks, and cigarette butts coming down from the vents ignited the leaking fuel. The crews saw the fire and tried to snuff it out using portable fire extinguishers, but failed. The fire grew larger in the engine compartment because of the open deck doors. It caused a power cutoff for two hours, and the emergency generator failed and any effort to extinguish the fire was halted because it was deemed impossible. The fuel that was still in every vehicle caused the fire to spread and burned up all the decks quickly. Thirty minutes after the fire started, the passengers were ordered to go to the upper deck and board the lifeboats. However, the evacuation process went slowly because there was only one door to the upper deck. Once they got to the upper decks, none of the crew nor the ship's officers directed them to the lifeboats. Some of the crew members even selfishly lowered the lifeboats for themselves. There were only six lifeboats, each with a capacity of only 50 people. Some passengers desperately dived into the sea, and some frantically waited for rescue. The first ship to conduct a rescue mission was the KM Sangihe, with Captain Agus K. Sumirat as the skipper. Sumirat was Abdul Rivai's classmate in the class of 1959 when they were studying at Academy Ilmu Pelayaran (Maritime Academy). Sangihe was travelling from Pare-pare to Surabaya for engine repair. Sangihe's first deck officer, J. Bilalu, was the first to see a puff of smoke to the west and thought the smoke was coming from Pertamina's offshore oil rig. Sangihes wireless operator, Abu Akbar, sent an SOS message at 08:15. KM Ilmamui joined the rescue effort at 21:00, followed four hours later by the tanker Palace VI and other ships, including Adhiguna Karunia and PT. Porodisa Line's KM Sengata. In the morning of January 26, the Java Sea was hit by torrential rain. The fire began to spread to the engine room, where there was unisolated fuel. As a result, in the morning of January 27, there was an explosion in the engine room which created an entrance for the sea water to fill the compartments. The generator and the propeller room filled with seawater, which resulted in the ship having a 45¬∞ list. Finally, at 12:45 on January 27 (about 30 hours after the first spark), the ship sank to the bottom of the Java Sea, along with 288 people in the lower decks. Captain Abdul Rival was the last to leave the ship, he sent a message to the skipper of Sangihe, \\"Please send me water and food, because I am going to stay on the ship until the last minute\\". The message was conveyed through Bakaila, a crew member who successfully crossed over to Sangihe. But the request was not fulfilled by Sumirat.  Victims  Rescuers estimated that 431 people were killed (143 bodies were found and 288 people were lost with the ship), while 753 people were rescued. Other sources put the number of victims as much larger, with up to 666 people killed. Of note, Palace VI managed to save 144 Tampomas passengers and discovered four bodies, while Sengata saved 169 people and discovered two bodies, while another ship, KM Sonne discovered 29 dead bodies, including captain Abdul Rival. The wireless operator, Odang Kusdinar, survived, he was found with 62 passengers in a lifeboat near Duang Duang Island, 240 km east of where Tampomas sank, on Friday, January 30, 1981 at 05:00.  Investigation  Minister of Transportation Roesmin Nurjadin, in his explanation to the press at the offices of the Department of Transportation, said that an abnormal thing happened in the engine room. The disorder occurred in the vehicle deck space, especially on a two-wheeled vehicle located in the rear, when a shock wave from the sea that was strong enough to raise sparks and allow a fire to spread. Machinist Wishardi Hamzah said that Tampomas II did not have a smoke detection system. The investigation, led by Attorney Bob Rush Efendi Nasution, did not provide meaningful results, because all errors were blamed on the crew. There is an impression that this case was intentionally covered up by the government at that time, although many in parliament demand a more serious investigation.  In popular culture  Iwan Fals created a song about the sinking entitled \\"Babble Seagull Fools and Blackened\\" * Ebiet G.

Some authorities consider it to be a separate species as Dicaeum kuehni. Taxonomy and systematics A comparison of plumage characteristics of male (left column) and female (right column) flowerpeckers. Grey-sided flowerpeckers (Dicaeum celebicum) from mainland Sulawesi are on the top, and Wakatobi flowerpeckers (D. kuehni) from the archipelago are on the bottom. The Wakatobi flowerpecker was originally described as a species of flowerpecker in 1903 by Ernst Hartert and was reclassified as a subspecies of the grey-sided flowerpecker shortly thereafter. The specific name commemorates Heinrich K√ºhn, a German bird collector who worked for Ernst Hartert in Indonesia. New analysis published in 2014 by Se√°n Kelly et al. proposed re-establishing the Wakatobi flowerpecker as a distinct species, based on DNA and morphological comparisons. Using a combination of genetic, phylogenetic, and phenotypic analyses, the team determined the Wakatobi flowerpecker was a distinct species from the Grey-sided flowerpecker. Additionally, genetic evidence showed that the two species come from distinct genetic lines that have not interbred. This suggests that neither species can traverse the between the Wakatobi islands and Sulawesi mainland. Description Wakatobi flowerpeckers exhibit sexual dimorphism. Males have dark gray feathers on the back and tail, white feathers on the belly, and red feathers on the chin. Females have medium gray feathers on the back and tail and light gray to white feathers on the belly and chin. Compared to the closely related grey-sided flowerpecker, the Wakatobi flowerpecker is significantly larger: it has longer wings, a longer bill, a longer skull, and is heavier. Additionally, there are subtle color variations: compared to the grey-sided flowerpecker, male Wakatobi flowerpeckers have bluer upper feathers, lighter side feathers, and their red coloring extends further down. For females there are no major color differences between the two species. The species feeds primarily on fruit.  Distribution and habitat  The Wakatobi flowerpecker is endemic to the Wakatobi Islands, off the SE peninsula of Sulawesi. Although the area lies within the Wakatobi National Park, there is currently no environmental protection, and scientists have expressed concern over its prospects given the rate of human development in the region.

He was the leader of the interrogation unit at Tuol Sleng (S-21), assisting Kang Kek Iew (Comrade Duch), the head of the camp where thousands were held for interrogation, torture and subsequent killing. Mam Nay gave testimony at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia on 14 July 2009.

Bizot further described Mam Nai as a 'true crime fiction character' with a terrifying 'gallows face'. He met him twice at the French Embassy compound in Phnom Penh, the second time during the arrest of Sirik Matak who had been hiding seeking political asylum.Fran√ßois Bizot, Le Portail, French edition. Page 250 Biography Mam Nai was born in Kampong Thom Province in 1934, while Cambodia was under French domination. He was taught by Son Sen at the Institut de P√©dagogie (Teacher Training College) in Phnom Penh, becoming a natural sciences teacher in 1956, and Kompong Thom's Balaign College principal in 1958. In the school environment he got to know Kang Kek Iew (Duch) who was his deputy principal. Both were arrested by Norodom Sihanouk's security services in 1967 owing to their leftist activities. After being freed from jail by Lon Nol in 1970, Mam Nai joined Duch in the guerrilla zone under the control of the Khmer Rouge. He assisted in the interrogation and torture of prisoners at 'M-13 prison camp', the first prison Duch set up in the forests of Amleang, Thpong District.Ben Kiernan, The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power and Genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-1979. Page 315 Together with Tang Sin Hean (Comrade Pon) Mam Nai helped Duch to perfect his interrogation techniques in order to purge perceived \\"enemies of the revolution\\" from the Khmer Rouge ranks. Prisoners at these camps, mostly disgraced Khmer Rouge cadres, were routinely starved and tortured to extract real and made-up confessions. Few prisoners left the camps alive. Following the Khmer Rouge victory in April 1975 Duch and his men set up prisons throughout the capital including the infamous Tuol Sleng prison. By 1978, as the party paranoia of seeking unchallenged authority and the ensuing purges increased towards the end of Pol Pot's rule, more and more people were brought to Tuol Sleng.The Tuol Sleng Archives and the Cambodian Genocide Mam Nai was fluent in the Vietnamese language, uncommon among Cambodians, and took part in the interrogation and torture of Vietnamese-background prisoners, contributing to the extermination of the Vietnamese Cambodian minority.Magazine of Documentation Center for Cambodia Number 7 July 2000 Mam Nai's signature is on scores of documents detailing the torture of DK's political opponents. He was together with his boss Duch seeing to the execution of surviving prisoners before abandoning Tuol Sleng prison and both were among the very last Khmer Rouge cadres to flee Phnom Penh when it fell to the People's Army of Vietnam on 7 January 1979. After escaping to the border, Mam Nai joined one of the Khmer Rouge groups that had found sanctuary in Thailand. In the 1990s he was still working as an interrogator for the Khmer Rouge after joining Front 250, commanded by Ny Korn. Mam Nai left the Khmer Rouge shortly before Pol Pot ordered Son Sen's assassination in 1997, living as a private small-scale farmer in the West of the country. Although Cambodian authorities knew where he lived for a long time no attempt was made to arrest him. According to Stephen Heder of London University Mam Nai is implicated in \\"hands-on torture and execution and would almost certainly be convicted in any international tribunal\\".Seven Candidates for Prosecution - American University After appearing at Duch's trial as a witness Mam Nai has, however, not been charged.Cambodian genocide trial hears from S21 interrogator At the trial he was asked questions regarding his involvement in the torture and murder of Phung Ton, former dean of Phnom Penh University, but Mam Nai carefully avoided incriminating himself.Cambodia‚Äôs Perfect War Criminal See also Democratic Kampuchea * Tuol Sleng * Kang Kek Iew * Torture *Killing Fields BibliographyChandler, David: Voices from S-21.

The facade has a broken anterior pediment above the entrance, a Baroque finish to an otherwise sober front, in measured doric pilasters. The interior, in Baroque style, has a single nave with three chapels on each side and was entirely stuccoed and painted by Domenico Dossa and Bernardo Barca. The frescoes, attributed to Giovanni Evangelista Draghi, depict the Glory of the Saints Ignatius, Luigi Gonzaga, Francis Xavier, and Francesco Borgia. The same artist also completed six oil paintings on canvas in stucco frames, which loom over the statues of some Jesuit saints, and contain episodes from the life of the founder of the Jesuits: the conversion of St Ignatius in the castle of Loyola, the holy penitent in Montserrat, his ascetic life at Manresa, his trip to the Holy Land, his apostleship, and his miracles. Four of the side chapels are frescoed in trompe l'oeil, attributed to Giuseppe Natali, while the wooden altarpieces are by Vincenzo Biazzi. Among the other paintings, in part preserved in the Collegiate Church of San Bartolomeo, are a San Giovanni Francesco de' Regis by Clemente Ruta, The Arrival of St Francis Xavier in the Indies by Draghi.

Similar to its temporal counterpart visual temporal attention, these attention modules have been widely implemented in video analytics in computer vision to provide enhanced performance and human interpretable explanation of deep learning models. Spatial attention allows humans to selectively process visual information through prioritization of an area within the visual field. A region of space within the visual field is selected for attention and the information within this region then receives further processing. Research shows that when spatial attention is evoked, an observer is typically faster and more accurate at detecting a target that appears in an expected location compared to an unexpected location. Attention is guided even more quickly to unexpected locations, when these locations are made salient by external visual inputs (such as a sudden flash), the human primary visual cortex plays a critical role for such an exogenous attentional guidance Li. Z. 2002 A saliency map in primary visual cortex Trends in Cognitive Sciences vol. 6, Pages 9-16, and Zhaoping, L. 2014, The V1 hypothesis‚Äîcreating a bottom-up saliency map for preattentive selection and segmentation in the book Understanding Vision: Theory, Models, and Data . Spatial attention is distinctive from other forms of visual attention such as object-based attention and feature-based attention. These other forms of visual attention select an entire object or a specific feature of an object regardless of its location, whereas spatial attention selects a specific region of space and the objects and features within that region are processed. Measures of visual spatial attention =Spatial cueing experiments= A key property of visual attention is that attention can be selected based on spatial location and spatial cueing experiments have been used to assess this type of selection. In Posner's cueing paradigm, the task was to detect a target that could be presented in one of two locations and respond as quickly as possible. At the start of each trial, a cue is presented that either indicates the location of the target (valid cue) or indicates the incorrect location thus misdirecting the observer (invalid cue). In addition, on some trials there is no information given about the location of the target, as no cue is presented (neutral trials). Two distinct cues were used; the cue was either a peripheral ‚Äòflicker‚Äô around the target's location (peripheral cue) or the cue was centrally displayed as a symbol, such as an arrow pointing to the location of the target (central cue). Observers are faster and more accurate at detecting and recognising a target if the location of the target is known in advance. Furthermore, misinforming subjects about the location of the target leads to slower reaction times and poorer accuracy relative to performance when no information about the location of the target is given. Spatial cueing tasks typically assess covert spatial attention, which refers to attention that can change spatially without any accompanying eye movements. To investigate covert attention, it is necessary to ensure that observer's eyes remain fixated at one location throughout the task. In spatial cueing tasks, subjects are instructed to fixate on a central fixation point. Typically it takes 200 ms to make a saccadic eye movement to a location. Therefore, the combined duration of the cue and target is typically presented in less than 200 ms. This ensures that covert spatial attention is being measured and the effects are not due to overt eye movements. Some studies specifically monitor eye movements to ensure that the observer's eyes are continually fixated on the central fixation point. The central and peripheral cues in spatial cueing experiments can assess the orienting of covert spatial attention. These two cues appear to use different mechanisms for orienting spatial attention. The peripheral cues tend to attract attention automatically, recruiting bottom-up attentional control processes. Conversely, central cues are thought to be under voluntary control and therefore use top- down processes. Studies have shown that peripheral cues are difficult to ignore, as attention is oriented towards the peripheral cue even when the observer knows the cue does not predict the location of the target. Peripheral cues also cause an allocation of attention much faster than central cues, as central cues require greater processing time to interpret the cue. =Spatial probe experiments= In spatial cueing tasks, the spatial probe (cue) causes an allocation of attention to a particular location. Spatial probes have also been often used in other types of tasks to assess how spatial attention is allocated. Spatial probes have been used to assess spatial attention in visual searches. Visual search tasks involve the detection of a target among a set of distractors. Attention to the location of items in the search can be used to guide visual searches. This was demonstrated by valid cues improving the identification of targets relative to the invalid and neutral conditions. A visual search display can also influence how fast an observer responds to a spatial probe. In a visual search task, a small dot appeared after a visual display and it was found that observers were faster at detecting the dot when it was located at the same location as the target. This demonstrated that spatial attention had been allocated to the target location. The use of multiple tasks simultaneously in an experiment can also demonstrate the generality of spatial attention, as allocation of attention to one task can influence performance in other tasks. For example, it was found that when attention was allocated to detecting a flickering dot (spatial probe), this increased the likelihood of identifying nearby letters. Distribution of spatial attention The distribution of spatial attention has been subject to considerable research. Consequently, this has led to the development of different metaphors and models that represent the proposed spatial distribution of attention. =Spotlight metaphor= According to the ‚Äòspotlight‚Äô metaphor, the focus of attention is analogous to the beam of a spotlight. The moveable spotlight is directed at one location and everything within its beam is attended and processed preferentially, while information outside the beam is unattended. This suggests that the focus of visual attention is limited in spatial size and moves to process other areas in the visual field. =Zoom-lens metaphor= Research has suggested that the attentional focus is variable in size. Eriksen and St James proposed the ‚Äòzoom-lens‚Äô metaphor, which is an alternative to the spotlight metaphor and takes into account the variable nature of attention. This account likens the distribution of attention to a zoom-lens that can narrow or widen the focus of attention. This supports findings that show attention can be distributed both over a large area of the visual field and also function in a focused mode. In support of this analogy, research has shown that there is an inverse relationship between the size of the attentional focus and the efficiency of processing within the boundaries of a zoom-lens. =Gradient model= The Gradient Model is an alternative theory on the distribution of spatial attention. This model proposes that attentional resources are allocated in a gradient pattern, with concentrated resources in the centre of focus and resources decrease in a continuous fashion away from the centre. Downing conducted research using an adaptation of Posner's cueing paradigm that supported this model. The target could appear in 12 potential locations, marked by boxes. Results showed that attentional facilitation was strongest at the cued location and gradually decreased with distance away from the cued location. However, not all research has supported the gradient model. For example, Hughes and Zimba conducted a similar experiment, using a highly distributed visual array and did not use boxes to mark the potential locations of the target. There was no evidence of a gradient effect, as the faster responses were when the cue and target were in the same hemifield and slower responses when they were in different hemifields. The boxes played an important role in attention as a later experiment, used the boxes and consequently found a gradient pattern. Therefore, it is considered that the size of the gradient can adjust according to the circumstances. A broader gradient may be adopted when there is an empty display, as attention can spread and is only restricted by hemifield borders. Splitting spatial attention It is debated in research on visual spatial attention whether it is possible to split attention across different areas in the visual field. The ‚Äòspotlight‚Äô and ‚Äòzoom-lens‚Äô accounts postulate that attention uses a single unitary focus. Therefore, spatial attention can only be allocated to adjacent areas in the visual field and consequently cannot be split. This was supported by an experiment that altered the spatial cueing paradigm by using two cues, a primary and a secondary cue. It was found that the secondary cue was only effective in focusing attention when its location was adjacent to the primary cue. In addition, it has been demonstrated that observers are unable to ignore stimuli presented in areas situated between two cued locations. These findings have proposed that attention cannot be split across two non-contiguous regions. However, other studies have demonstrated that spatial attention can be split across two locations. For example, observers were able to attend simultaneously to two different targets located in opposite hemifields. Research has even suggested that humans are able to focus attention across two to four locations in the visual field. Another perspective is that spatial attention can be split only under certain conditions. This perspective suggests that the splitting of spatial attention is flexible. Research demonstrated that whether spatial attention is unitary or divided depends on the goals of the task. Therefore, if dividing attention is beneficial to the observer then a divided focus of attention will be utilised. One of the main difficulties in establishing whether spatial attention can be divided is that a unitary focus model of attention can also explain a number of the findings. For example, when two non-contiguous locations are attended to, it may not be that attention has been split between these two locations but instead it may be that the unitary focus of attention has expanded. Alternatively, the two locations may not be attended to simultaneously and instead the area of focus is moving quickly from one location to another. Consequently, it appears very difficult to prove undoubtedly that spatial attention can be split. Deficits in visual spatial attention =Hemineglect= Hemineglect , also known as unilateral visual neglect, attentional neglect, hemispatial neglect or spatial neglect, is a disorder incorporating a significant deficit in visuospatial attention. Hemineglect refers to the inability of patients with unilateral brain damage to detect objects in the side of space contralateral to the lesion (contralesional); i.e. damage to the right cerebral hemisphere resulting in neglect of objects on the left side of space, and is characterized by hemispheric asymmetry. Performance is generally preserved in the side ipsilateral to the lesion (ipsilesional). Hemineglect is more frequent and arguably more severe following damage to the right cerebral hemisphere of right-handed subjects. It has been proposed that the right parietal lobes are comparatively more responsible for the allocation of spatial attention, therefore damage to this hemisphere often produces more severe effects. Additionally, it is difficult to map with accuracy the visual sensory deficits in the neglected hemifield. Neglect is diagnosed using a variety of paper-and-pencil tasks. A common method is the Complex Figure Test (CFT). The CFT requires patients to copy a complicated line drawing, and then reproduce it from memory. Often patients will neglect features present on the contralesional side of space and objects. Patients with neglect will perform similarly when reproducing mental images of familiar places and objects. A common error is the failure to include numbers on the left side of a picture when drawing an analogue clock from memory, for example, all of the numbers may be positioned on the right side of the clock face. Another paper-and- pencil task is the line bisection task. In this exercise, patients are required to divide a horizontal line halfway along. Patients with neglect will often bisect the line to the right of the true centre, leaving the left portion of the line unattended to. Object cancellation tasks are also used to determine the extent of potential deficit. During this task, patients are required to cancel out (cross out) all of the objects in a cluttered display (e.g. lines, geometric shapes, letters, etc.). Patients with damage primarily to the right parietal area fail in the detection of objects in the left visuospatial field, and these are often not crossed out by the patient. In addition, those patients who may be severely affected tend to fail in detecting their errors on visual inspection. =Extinction= Extinction is a phenomenon observable during double simultaneous stimulation of both left and right visual fields. Patients with extinction will fail to perceive the stimulus in the contralesional visual field when presented in conjunction with a stimulus in the ipsilesional field. However, when presented on its own, patients can correctly perceive the contralesional stimulus. Thus, patients with neglect fail to report stimuli present in the aberrant field, whereas patients with extinction fail to report stimuli in the aberrant field only when double simultaneous presentations occur in both hemifields. Analogous to neglect, extinction affects the contralesional visuospatial field in majority of patients with unilateral damage. Anatomical correlates of visuospatial neglect and extinction do not overlap absolutely, with extinction proposed to be associated with subcortical lesions. A common method in quick detection of visuospatial extinction is a Finger Confrontation Model. Utilized as standard bedside evaluation, the task requires the patient to indicate (either verbally or by pointing) in which visual field the doctor's hand or finger is moving, while the doctor makes a wiggling motion with his index. This enables the doctor to distinguish between deficits resembling neglect and those which may indicate extinction, by presenting either a single stimulus in the contralesional field or two simultaneous stimuli in both the contralesional and ipsilesional visual fields. This quick test can be used immediately in a hospital setting for quick diagnosis, and can be particularly useful following strokes and seizures. Regions associated with impairment of visuospatial attention =Parietal damage= The posterior parietal region is arguably the most extensively studied in relation to visuospatial attention. Patients with parietal lobe damage most often fail to attend to stimuli located on the contralesional hemisphere, as seen in patients with hemineglect/unilateral visual neglect. As such, they may fail to acknowledge a person sitting to their left, they may neglect to eat food positioned on their left, or make head or eye movements to the left. Computed tomography (CT) studies have demonstrated that the inferior parietal lobule in the right hemisphere is the most frequently damaged in patients with severe neglect. Parietal damage may decrease the ability to reduce decision noise. Spatial cues appear to reduce the uncertainty of a visuospatial decision. Disruption to spatial orienting, as seen in hemineglect, suggests that patients with damage to the parietal region may experience an increased difficulty in decision-making regarding targets located in the contralesional field. Damage to the parietal region may also increase illusory conjunctions of features. Illusory conjunctions occur when people report combinations of features which did not occur. For example, when presented with an orange square and a purple circle, the participant may report a purple square or an orange circle. Although it would typically require special circumstances for a non-impaired person to produce an illusory conjunction, it appears that some patients with damage to the parietal cortex may demonstrate a vulnerability to such visuospatial impairments. Results from parietal patients suggest that the parietal cortex, and therefore spatial attention, may be implicated in solving this problem of binding features. =Frontal lobe damage= Lesions to the frontal cortices have long been known to precede spatial neglect and other visuospatial deficits. Specifically, frontal lobe damage has been associated with a deficit in the control of over attention (the production of eye movements). Lesions to the superior frontal lobe areas that include the frontal eye fields seem to disrupt some forms of overt eye movements. It has been demonstrated by Guitton, Buchtel, & Douglas that eye movement directed away from an abruptly appearing visual target (‚Äúantisaccade‚Äù) is remarkably impaired in patients with damage to the frontal eye fields, who frequently made reflexive eye movements to the target. When frontal eye field patients did make antisaccades, they had increased latency of their eye movements compared to controls. This suggests that the frontal lobes, specifically the dorsolateral region containing the frontal eye fields, play an inhibitory role in preventing reflexive eye movements in overt attention control. Further, the frontal eye fields or surrounding areas may be critically associated with neglect following dorsolateral frontal lesions. Frontal lobe lesions also appear to produce deficits in visuospatial attention related to covert attention (the orienting of attention without the requirement eye movement). Using Posner's Spatial Cueing Task, Alivesatos and Milner (1989; see ) found that participants with frontal lobe damage demonstrated a comparably smaller attentional benefit from the valid cues than control participants or participants with temporal lobe damage. Voluntary orienting of frontal lobe patients appear to be impaired. The right lateral frontal lobe region was also found to be associated with left-sided visual neglect in an investigation carried out by Husain & Kennard. A region of overlap was found in the location of lesions in four of five patients with left-sided visual neglect, specifically the dorsal aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus and the underlying white matter. Additionally, overlap of lesion areas was also detected in the dorsal region of Brodmann area 44 (anterior to the premotor cortex). These results further implicate the frontal lobe in directing attention in visual space. =Thalamic nuclei damage (pulvinar nucleus)= The thalamic nuclei have been speculated to be involved in directing attention to locations in visual space. Specifically, the pulvinar nucleus appears to be implicated in the subcortical control of spatial attention, and lesions in this area can cause neglect. Evidence suggests that the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus might be responsible for engaging in spatial attention at a previously cued location. A study by Rafal and Posner found that patients who had acute pulvinar lesions were slower to detect a target which appeared in the contralesional visuospatial field compared to the appearance of a target in the ipsilesional field during a spatial cuing task. This suggests a deficit in the ability to use attention to improve performance in detection and processing of visual targets in the contralesional region. Use in camouflage Camouflage relies on deceiving the cognition of the observer, such as a predator. Some camouflage mechanisms such as distractive markings likely function by competing for visual attention with stimuli that would give away the presence of the camouflaged object (such as a prey animal). Such markings have to be conspicuous, and positioned away from the outline so as to avoid drawing attention to it, in contrast to disruptive markings which work best when in contact with the outline.

In 1887 whilst working on the New Alma and Victoria gold mine James lost parts of his right hand's fingers and thumb whilst holding a dynamite cap that accidentally detonated. Waukaringa raised over ¬£20 to help James in his recovery. On 12 August 1891 Harold Oliver was born. Harold had eleven siblings. During Harold's childhood in the 1890s Waukaringa was home to around 600 people. On 23 February 1895 James left Waukaringa taking his family to Broken Hill. The Adelaide Observer noted his departure from the town saying \\"Mr Oliver left Waukaringa today. He was one of the oldest residents, and most respected.\\" Today Waukaringa is a ghost town.  Broken Hill years (1895‚Äì1908)  When Harold Oliver was five his family moved to the New South Wales mining town of Broken Hill. Oliver started playing football in Broken Hill for a junior team called the South Imperials. In 1908, his last year living in Broken Hill, he debuted for the South Broken Hill Football Club in the Broken Hill Football League at the age of 17. Lyrup Football Club (1909) In 1909 Harold Oliver moved to Lyrup, South Australia and started a farm growing fruit. During this time, he captained the Lyrup football team which had previously not won a game. In 1909, with the assistance of his brother, Harold helped the Lyrup football club win the local riverland league premiership. Oliver was awarded the Lyrup Football Club best and fairest award at the end of the riverland season. After the season Lyrup traveled to Mildura where they lost twice to the home team. The Mildura Cultivator praised Oliver's marking and kicking reporting that it was as good as anyone who had played at the ground. An umpire at the game from Melbourne told Harold that he would be welcome in Melbourne to play football if he wanted to. At the end of 1909 Oliver was contemplating moving to Queensland to join his sister in the state but two friends, the Musgrave brothers, who played for West Suburbans in Adelaide suggested he come down and visit. Port Adelaide Football Club (1910‚Äì1922) When Oliver arrived in Adelaide he started playing for West Suburbans and immediately began to draw attention from the two largest South Australian Football League (SAFL) clubs, Norwood and Port Adelaide. South Australian businessman Edwin T. Smith was sending Oliver letters asking him to come train with Norwood whilst John Woolard, then captain of Port Adelaide who like Oliver grew up in Broken Hill, was also enquiring about his services. Before Oliver made his debut with Port Adelaide he was lined up with a job shovelling furnace waste. Disgruntled, he spoke to the Musgrave brothers father who suggested he approach West Torrens and train with them, to which Oliver agreed. Port Adelaide secretary James Hodge prevented this move as Oliver had signed a contract with him shortly beforehand. Hodge later took Oliver out on a fishing trip to resolve the feud and found him a better job. = Debut for Port Adelaide = National football carnival in 1911 (L-R: Congear, Oliver, Hosking, Hansen). Harold Oliver was listed to make his debut for the club in the first round of the 1910 SAFL season. Such was Oliver's enthusiasm to make his debut he arrived at the Adelaide Train Station in his full playing uniform. However, due to the death of King Edward VII the first round of SAFL matches were postponed as a sign of respect. Oliver eventually made his senior debut for Port Adelaide on 25 June 1910 in a win against North Adelaide at Jubilee Oval. Port Adelaide would win the SAFL premiership in Oliver's debut season and would subsequently contest the 1910 Championship of Australia in a match against Victorian Football League (VFL) premiers Collingwood. Harold Oliver kicked 5 goals in the match helping Port Adelaide defeat Collingwood and claim national honours. In 1910 Oliver also made the journey with Port Adelaide to Western Australia to play a series of matches. This was the first trip by an eastern state club to play football in Western Australia. Harold Oliver was awarded a gold medal by Port Adelaide for being the best junior of the 1910 season for the club. Harold Oliver was a member of the South Australian state team that won the 1911 Interstate Carnival defeating the Victorian side 11.11 (77) to 5.4 (34). Players in the 1911 South Australian team included Bert Renfrey (captain), Vic Cumberland, Richard Head, Tom Leahy, Dave Low along with Port Adelaide players Sampson Hosking, Angelo Congear and Frank Hansen.\\"The South Australian team\\". The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA). 5 August 1911. p. 17. During round 2 of the 1911 SAFL season Oliver kicked 7 goals against North Adelaide in what was his twelfth game for Port Adelaide. At the end of the 1911 SAFL season Harold Oliver was awarded his first Port Adelaide Best and Fairest in just his second year at the club. During an end of year dinner for the Port Adelaide Football Club players and officials the, then vice president of the club, Dr Alexander Benson declared that \\"Oliver should have gained the Magarey Medal\\" which was instead won by Harold Cumberland. Dr Benson's position was supported by readers of The Sport, an upstart Adelaide newspaper, whose readers voted more than 6‚Äì1 that Oliver had a better season than Cumberland. He kicked 28 goals in the 1912 SAFL season. During a game against Norwood at Norwood Oval, Oliver got into a fight with Ed Edwards of Norwood with both players reported by umpire Dollman. As a result both Oliver and Edwards were suspended thereby meaning the Magarey Medal favourite would be disqualified from winning the award. Despite this, at the end of the 1912 SAFL season he would be awarded his second consecutive Port Adelaide Best and Fairest. Oliver polled first in the clubs best and fairest for almost every round and won the award by over 500 votes. The Register, a local Adelaide newspaper, said regarding the Magarey Medal that \\"While giving full credit to the winner, however, it is only fair to state that had not Oliver (the brilliant young Port Adelaide player) been disqualified through a regrettable occurrence in a match at Norwood he would undoubtedly have been the medallist this time. He stands out conspicuously.\\" Port Adelaide's 1914 \\"Invincible's\\" team. For the 1913 season Oliver was appointed vice captain of Port Adelaide alongside new club captain John Londrigan who had just come from the Adelaide University Football Club after that club's failed attempt to gain entry into the SAFL. During August Harold Oliver married Blanche Downer from Lyrup. Port Adelaide won the 1913 SAFL premiership by defeating North Adelaide in the 1913 SAFL Grand Final in front of 22,000 spectators at Adelaide Oval. Oliver and Port Adelaide went on to win the 1913 Championship of Australia by defeating VFL premier Fitzroy. In 1914 Harold Oliver played every game for the year. He was part of Port Adelaide's undefeated 1914 team that held North Adelaide to a single goal in the 1914 SAFL Grand Final and defeated VFL premiers Carlton in the 1914 Championship of Australia match at the Adelaide Oval. A game played between Port Adelaide and a composite team of the best SAFL players was held in the post season with Port Adelaide coming out as the victors. Harold Oliver captained Port Adelaide that day and was awarded a trophy as best on ground with arguably the best players of the competition taking to the field on that day. = War years in Berri and the Patriotic League = During World War I Harold Oliver returned to Berri to maintain his farm. One of his close friends William Powell sent him a letter during his time serving that included a short paragraph describing how Australian soldiers were discussing his prowess and that others were exclaiming \\"OLIVER\\" whilst playing the Australian game. Due to the war, the SAFA suspended its competition from 1916 through to 1918. Despite this official suspension, a group of South Australian clubs decided to form their own league in 1916 and the money generated would be put toward the war effort. The Railways Football Club was one of the clubs that participated in this competition and managed to attract Harold Oliver to be the club's captain. Unfortunately for the Railways, Oliver would only play one game for the Railways, and would instead return to Berri to focus on his farm. Later in the season, Oliver returned to Port Adelaide to play a few games for the club who was also partaking in the Patriotic League. Port Adelaide would end up winning the 1916 South Australian Patriotic League Grand Final defeating West Torrens 7.11 (53) to 1.13 (19). Harold Oliver played for Port Adelaide during the game and kicked a goal. After World War I Harold Oliver had chosen to retire from league football for the upcoming 1919 SAFL season. Towards the close of the 1919 SAFL season Port Adelaide had successfully qualified for finals, finishing the minor round fourth. In a bid to increase their chances of September success, Port Adelaide put a call out to Oliver to play in the club's final against West Torrens to which he accepted. Unfortunately, Oliver was out of touch not having played during the year and Port Adelaide was eliminated from the years finals. = Return to football, captain of Port Adelaide and South Australia = Rover motorcycle for Oliver (same as the model pictured) to enable him to make the trip back and forth to his farm in Berri, South Australia. In 1920 keen supporters of the Port Adelaide Football Club, headed by Mr. Swain, collectively raised ¬£77.13.8 and bought Harold a Rover 3.5hp motor-cycle so he could make his commute of over 200 km to and from Berri where he eventually settled on his own property as a fruit grower during the 1920 season. During the 1921 season Oliver served his sole season as Port Adelaide captain. During August, Oliver would be designated captain of the South Australian state team during a trip to Western Australia for a state football carnival along with Victoria. Oliver would become sick during the trip and would miss the game against Victoria but would manage to play a game as captain of South Australia against Western Australia a few days later. 1921 SAFL premiership. Upon returning to Adelaide for the remainder of the season he would lead the club to the 1921 SAFL premiership, defeating Norwood by 8 points in the 1921 SAFL Grand Final in front of 34,800 spectators at the Adelaide Oval. This would be Oliver's fourth and final premiership with Port Adelaide. In 1922 after playing only 5 league matches for the season his career at Port Adelaide finally came to an end due to commitments to his farm at Berri and disputes regarding game compensation. His contract termination meant he was paid ¬£76 of ¬£100 pounds for the season.  Return to Riverland football (1923‚Äì1932)  Harold Oliver, second from right, with the 1938 Berri Football Club URML premiers. When Harold Oliver retired from league football he returned to his fruit farm to settle with his wife Blanche in the South Australian Riverland town of Berri. He became captain-coach of the Berri Football Club in 1923. During a match for Berri-Barmera in 1925, a drunken spectator by the name of John Purcell who, after previously shouting abuse at Oliver, went onto the playing field just before half time and punched Harold in the jaw with a glancing blow. Oliver retaliated and punched Purcell in self defence as he was intimidated by Purcell who was a \\"big\\" man. Purcell later died with meningitis and Oliver was subsequently arrested. At Oliver's court hearing the Jury retired for only five minutes and returned a verdict of \\"not guilty\\". Berri Football Club replanted a new oval in 1927 and Harold Oliver worked as a groundskeeper. During that year Oliver recommended Berri footballer John Wade to his old club Port Adelaide. Wade would successfully go on to play in Port Adelaide's 1928 premiership. In 1929 at the age of 38 Oliver had kicked 21 goals from the opening three games for the Upper Murray Association football team and averaged more than 10 goals at the club's Berri home ground for the season. He played his last ever football game in 1931 when his club won the Upper Murray Association premiership defeating Barmera. During the match he kicked six goals from six shots at goal. Oliver coached Berri to premierships in 1937 and 1938. During the 1938 post season Oliver organised an exhibition match between Berri and his old club Port Adelaide.  Personal life  Harold Oliver married Blanche Downer of Lyrup on 19 July 1913. He had three children, Beryl, James and Joyce. In his retirement Oliver lived in Cowandilla. He died on 15 November 1958 aged 67. The only club representatives at his funeral were Bob McLean and Charles Darwent leading to the former to say in his book '100 Years with the Magpies' that \\"There is a very true saying, when referring to the champions, that they are peacock's feathers today and feather dusters tomorrow ... How the mighty fall!\\".  Legacy  Oliver taking a spectacular mark during the 1914 SAFL Semi Final against at Adelaide Oval. Harold Oliver is often considered one of the best South Australian players never to win the Magarey Medal. This is partially the result of the medal not being awarded for several years during World War I while the SAFL competition was suspended along with being ineligible in 1912. = Spectacular mark = Within South Australia at the time he was unanimously considered the best exponent of the spectacular high flying mark. In 1935, Australian cricket umpire George Hele, whilst writing for The Sporting Globe in Melbourne, described Harold Oliver as the \\"[Roy] Cazaly of South Australia\\". When former South Adelaide champion Steve McKee was reminiscing about Oliver's debut in 1910 he wrote that \\"Harold Oliver, a highflier equal in skill to [Phil] Matson, but more certain in his leaping, burst like a meteor into the football firmament in that year. = Interstate reputation = Phil Matson, East Perth premiership player and coach, regarded Harold Oliver as the best centre man he had met during his football career. Tom Outridge Sr, winner of the inaugural Sandover Medal, said that one of his outstanding memories was of Harold Oliver, stating that when he was a boy he was \\"taken by his father to see Port play at Kalgoorlie in 1913; The memory of Oliver's brilliant game is as vivid in my mind today as it was when I left the ground that day. He was a wonderful player.\\" After the 1911 Adelaide Carnival Ralph Robertson praised the performance of Oliver. When retired Tasmanian footballer Charlie Goddard travelled to watch his son play for Tasmania at the 1914 Sydney Carnival he stated how he was enraptured by Harold Oliver's play saying he was \\"the noblest roman of them all\\". = Local reputation = Tom Leahy, Magarey Medalist and captain of North Adelaide, once stated after a game at Alberton Oval that \\"North Adelaide would certainly have won had Port not possessed a superman in Oliver.\\" Vic Richardson, captain of the Sturt Football Club and Australian cricket team, described Harold Oliver as being \\"The finest all-round exponent of Australian football in my playing and watching experience of it\\". Charlie Checkett, long serving curator of the Adelaide Oval considered Harold Oliver \\"The greatest footballer this state [South Australia] has produced\\". When James Matthews, captain of North Adelaide and South Australian cricketer, was asked in 1951, four decades after he retired, who he thought was the finest all-round Australian rules footballer, he stated Harold Oliver. In 1965 a publication covering 100 years of South Australian football written by Charles Knuckey included the states all-time team with Harold Oliver allocated the position of centre half forward. = Port Adelaide reputation = Angelo Congear, whose career completely overlapped with Oliver, said that \\"As an all-roundplayer, Harold Oliver is my pick. In his prime he played a wonderfully clever game anywhere. He is also the fairest player it has been my pleasure to play with.\\" In 1924 after 40 years of involvement with training footballers Jack McGargill, former Port Adelaide head trainer, described Harold Oliver as \\"the finest footballer the state has produced\\". In 1948 Arthur Swain, the club's former chairman who had been associated with the club for 44 years at the time, stated that \\"Harold Oliver was the greatest footballer I have ever seen in my life\\" thereby ranking him ahead of the recently retired Bob Quinn. A section of the 1951 PAFC Annual Report paid tribute to Harold Oliver stating that he \\"was a champion in any position on the field, being an outstanding high mark and a magnificent kick. He played with conspicuous brilliance in many interstate matches and will rank amongst the really great players of all time.\\" Albert Tomlin who played with Port Adelaide from 1888 to 1894 considered Harold Oliver to be Port Adelaide's best ever player and the best all-rounder anywhere alongside Tom MacKenzie. = Honours = Oliver was one of the first 18 inaugural members of Port Adelaide's Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2001 Harold Oliver was named in the Port Adelaide Football Club's greatest team on the Half Forward Flank. In 2002 Harold Oliver was inducted into the South Australian Football Hall of Fame. In 2020 the Adelaide Advertiser ranked Port Adelaide's best 50 players with Harold Oliver coming in at number 11. = Omission from Australian Football Hall of Fame = As one of the most fabled all-time players for the Port Adelaide Football Club and the club's best player during its most dominant seasons many South Australian football historians have questioned Oliver's absence from the Australian Football Hall of Fame. Michaleangelo Rucci has suggested that the lack of film footage for pre-war players from outside Victoria makes it hard to induct otherwise worthy inductees, this being the case for Oliver. Football historian and editor Adam Cardosi noted that only three pre-World War I players have been inducted since 1996 and suggests that Oliver should be one considered beyond the Victorian boarder. In 2019 Neil Cross observed that the Hall of Fame selection committee was \\"made up of 11 Victorians, one South Australian and one Western Australian, it was inevitably biased towards those who played out their careers in Victoria\\".

The process is known as vajazzling, a portmanteau of \\"vajayjay\\" (or vagina) and \\"bedazzle\\". The phenomenon was popularized by actress Jennifer Love Hewitt, who devoted a chapter in her book The Day I Shot Cupid to vajazzling. During a promotional interview on Lopez Tonight in 2010, she encouraged the female members of her audience \\"to vajazzle their vajayjays\\". In the United Kingdom, the concept was popularized when beautician Amy Childs appeared in the television show The Only Way Is Essex in 2010. By 2011, an Internet rating site for vajazzling called Rate My Vajazzle had been set up. Vajazzling can increase risks of infection if not properly cleaned.

A photograph from the Holtermann Collection. The Holtermann Collection is the name given to a collection of about 3,500 glass-plate negatives which mainly depicts life in the New South Wales goldfields towns of Hill End, Gulgong, Home Rule and Canadian Lead. Photographs of people and prominent landmarks are also included. The photographs were taken in the second half of the nineteenth century. The collection is held by the State Library of New South Wales.The Holtermann Collection, State Library of New South Wales.. Retrieved 6 June 2014. History The 3500 wet-plate glass negatives in the Holtermann collection capture life in goldfields towns in regional Australia between 1872 and 1876, including the towns of Hill End and Gulgong, as well as Melbourne and Sydney in the 1870s. The photographs were commissioned by Bernhardt Otto Holtermann and taken by Beaufoy Merlin and Charles Bayliss. Producing the glass-plates was slow work. Long exposures were required and only one photograph at a time could be processed. Furthermore, the wet plate negatives captured exceptional detail, but photographs made after the discovery of the plates failed to reveal the wealth of information hidden within. =Rediscovery= In 1951 the negatives were discovered in a garden shed in Chatswood, New South Wales. In response to an inquiry made by Keast Burke, then associate editor of the Australasian Photo-Review, to the Mitchell Library in Sydney, Burke was advised by the Mitchell Librarian that she had 'recently heard that the plates of photographs taken by old Mr. Holtermann' may be in the possession of the widow of Holtermann's youngest son. In the event, the collection of glass-plate negatives was in the garden room that had remained locked for many years. Thus the room disclosed its long-hidden treasures. The fortuitous timing of the advice to the library and Mr. Burke's inquiry, together Mr. Burke's ability to recognise the treasure and the chance safe-keeping of the plates for over seventy-five years, conspired to enable the conservation of this remarkable collection. In time, the find proved to be the most important photographic documentation of goldfields life in Australia.Gold and Silver: Photographs of Australian Goldfield from the Holtermann Collection by Keast Burke, Penguin Books Australia, 1973, pp 1‚Äì4. International significance The international significance of the collection is due to its size and quality together with the level of detail captured in the images. It is a rare survivor of a large-scale nineteenth- century Australian photographic archive. The collection includes three of the largest surviving wet-plate negatives in the world. In May 2013, the Holtermann Collection of glass plate negatives at the State Library of New South Wales was included on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register ‚Äì Asia and the Pacific. Three giant views of Sydney Harbour, the largest measuring over 1.6 metres wide, were added to the UNESCO International Memory of the World Register in November 2017. The giant negatives join only five other inscriptions from Australia on the World Register. Digitisation In 2008, the collection was digitally scanned at very high resolution and, for the first time in over 100 years, it was possible to see with astonishing clarity what Merlin and Bayliss had actually photographed. In 2015, Gulgong Holtermann Museum was launched in Gulgong, NSW.http://www.mudgeeguardian.com.au/story/2839026/gulgongs-holtermann-museum- launch-reveals-first-drawings/ References External links The Holtermann Collection.

The band draws heavily from British glam rock of the 1970s and performs regularly on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood and throughout the Los Angeles club scene. History When Lizzie Grey left London in 1988, he made a conscious decision to return to his roots in 1970s British glam rock. Grey began a project under the name Ultra Pop to pursue this end, recording the first album, Ultra Pop (1988), largely as a solo effort. Kerrang! magazine critic Malcolm Dome gave the self-titled Ultra Pop album a 5-\\"K\\" review in 1988, after which Grey formed a band and began to tour under the \\"Ultra Pop\\" name with members Vince Votel, Chris \\"Cupcake\\" Taylor, and Ernie Machado. According to drummer Tim Yasui, \\"Ultra Pop borrowed their stage image from a combination of Stanley Kubrick‚Äôs Clockwork Orange film and the Rocky Horror Picture Show.\\" Grey hired ex-London drummer Tim Yasui (stage name Timothy Jay) in late 1990 to replace departing drummer Ernie Machado during the writing of a third album, and decided to change the name of the project to \\"Spiders & Snakes\\" to reflect the heavier sound that Yasui brought the band, as well as to quell confusion and fan dissatisfaction the name \\"Ultra Pop\\" was creating. The name \\"Spiders & Snakes\\" is taken from the song of the same name by country/western artist Jim Stafford. Under the name Spiders & Snakes, the band released two EP's, Arachnomania (1991) and Arachno 2 (1992), followed by the full-length album 2000 Retro (1993). The album's single \\"Lost For Words\\" reached number one on the import singles charts in Denmark in 1994. Leigh Lawson was added as bassist to the touring lineup in 1993 in support of the 1993-1994 tour for 2000 Retro. Oddities: The Glitter Years was produced by Kim Fowley and released in 1995. Astro Pop (1997) was produced by Flipside magazine contributor Martin McMartin and former The Humpers guitarist Mark \\"Anarchy\\" Lee, who together went for a fast, punk rock-influenced sound with minimal production. According to Yasui, the album has become a fan favorite \\"because it does have that punk edge.\\" The band adopted a silver spaceman look with silver makeup for this phase of the group. Spiders and Snakes' album London Daze (2000) In 1999, Spiders & Snakes' version of \\"Public Enemy #1\\" was chosen for inclusion in their Cleopatra Records' electro tribute to M√∂tley Cr√ºe entitled Shout At the Remix; Spiders & Snakes' version was remixed by the British Gothic rock group Rosetta Stone for the album. \\"Public Enemy #1\\" was originally written by Grey and performed by London; the song was subsequently recorded by M√∂tley Cr√ºe and released on their debut album Too Fast For Love (1981). Cleopatra Records then signed Spiders & Snakes to their Deadline imprint, where they released London Daze in 2000. London Daze features rerecordings of songs that were recorded or played by Grey's and Yasui's previous band London. The most successful track on the album was the rerecording of \\"Public Enemy #1\\". According to Grey, the track received \\"a great deal of airplay both domestically and international[ly].\\" The album also includes three tracks from a 16-track demo recorded by London in 1980 featuring ex-Mott the Hoople vocalist Nigel Benjamin on vocals and M√∂tley Cr√ºe bassist Nikki Sixx on bass. One month after the release of London Daze, the band's bass player, Leigh Lawson, died. The band cancelled their 2000 tour, and hired a friend of Yasui's named Joe Petro to replace Lawson. Late in 2001, Yasui and Petro teamed up with Jeff Duncan of Armored Saint and Odin and Happenin' Harry of The Haptones to form a one-off group named Forever Say Die!. This group recorded a cover of Black Sabbath's \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" for Cleopatra Records' tribute album Evil Lives: A True Metal Tribute to Metal Tribute to Black Sabbath. Spiders & Snakes began working on new material in 2004, initially as a duo consisting of Grey and Yasui. The two began recording in 2005 to lay down a song written by Yasui about the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal entitled \\"Bill's Cigar\\", but ended up recording more songs with the remaining studio time. The two then continued writing and recording more songs until they had enough material for an eleven-song album. The album was released as Hollywood Ghosts in 2005, and included a bonus DVD of videos covering the band's career dating back to 1990. Hollywood Ghosts featured four songs with Yasui on vocals, marking the first time Yasui ever sang lead vocals for the band. The band then signed to Big M.F./Zain Records in Japan, who released Hollywood Ghosts to the Japanese market in 2006. Initially, Grey and Yasui were performing an acoustic duo, but put together a band to tour for the Hollywood Ghosts album. The band rehired guitarist Doug E. Sex from the London Daze lineup, and added bass player Phil St. Vincent on bass. During the summer of 2006, Spiders & Snakes were featured in a TV commercial sponsored by the California Department of Conservation's recycling program centered around a song entitled \\"Who Threw the Bottle in the Trash?\\" that eventually aired during the Super Bowl that same year. In 2007, Spiders & Snakes signed with Corporate Punishment Records, and released Melodrama, which, according to the band's website, attempted \\"to create an album on an independent budget in the spirit of Bob Ezrin's earlier efforts with KISS and Alice Cooper.\\" In 2014, Spiders & Snakes released an album entitled Year of the Snake, which was recorded in 2013-2014 during the Chinese calendar Year Of The Snake. The album features a cover of Angel's \\"‚ÄúI Ain‚Äôt Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore,‚Äù and guest appearances by Billy Sherwood of Yes, Angelo Moore of Fishbone, Rik Fox of W.A.S.P. and Steeler, Ryo Okumoto of Spock's Beard, and Betsy of Bitch, amongst others. The album was released by Sansei Records on October 28 in the United States, and will be released in Europe and Asia on December 9 by RSK Entertainment. On October 29, the band released a video for the single \\"Kawasaki City\\" from Year of the Snake. The song and the video document and recreate a particularly memorable night the band spent at a rock nightclub called \\"Groupie Dolls\\" in Kawasaki, Kanagawa in Japan. The track features vocals and songwriting by Tim Yasui. Spiders & Snakes performed at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, California on December 18, 2014. This the official record release party for Year Of The Snake and also a commemorative celebration of the 25th anniversary of the band's formation. Grey died in August 2019.

In his rookie season for the Jets, he averaged 4.8 points and 5.2 rebounds in 17 games. In December 2011, Bailey left the Manawatu Jets, opting out of the second year of his two-year contract due to family and work commitments; he also desired to move back to Auckland. Later that month, he signed with the Auckland Pirates for the 2012 New Zealand NBL season. He won a championship with the Pirates in 2012, and averaged 3.9 points and 3.5 rebounds in 15 games. In January 2013, Bailey signed with the re-established Super City Rangers for the 2013 New Zealand NBL season. He subsequently had a breakout season playing for the young Rangers squad as he averaged 11.8 points and 7.8 rebounds in 15 games.

In nine games for the Sharks in 2016, Bailey averaged 8.8 points, 6.1 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game. Bailey began the 2017 season operating at '70 to 80' percent, as he battled different leg niggles through the Sharks' first eight games.

Despite the elevation, he only managed to appear in five games, scoring a total of six points. On 9 July 2014, Bailey signed a one-year deal (with the option of a second) with the Breakers. Gaining a full roster spot for the 2014‚Äì15 season earned Bailey more playing time as he appeared in 27 games, averaging 2.0 points and 1.2 rebounds, and in the process became an Australian NBL champion after the Breakers defeated the Cairns Taipans 2‚Äì1 in the best-of-three grand final series. On 29 April 2015, the Breakers exercised the team option on Bailey's contract, re-signing him for the 2015‚Äì16 season.

It lies within the municipality of Ramberg in the county of S√ºdliche Weinstra√üe in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Its V-shaped cross-section was cut by the waters of the Holperbach stream, which has incised deeply into the rock layers of the Lower Bunter. The valley floor climbs from an elevation of about 250 metres to well over 400 metres. Its slopes are covered with mixed forest and sweet chestnut. Whilst at one time, the valley produced raw materials for the traditional broom and brush-making industries, today forestry and tourism predominate. In the immediate vicinity of the Holpertal are a number of points of interest that include the castle ruins of Meistersel, Ramburg and Neuscharfeneck Castle, the Brushmakers' Museum in Ramberg and a number of hiking destinations.

He is the inaugural Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Cambridge and a specialist in the treatment of glaucoma. In 2013, Professor Martin's team tested a novel technique of bio-printing, using an ink jet to recreate layers of ganglion and glial cells from a rat's retina, a process that has been described as 'printing eyeballs'. Retinal cells within a drop being sprayed from an inkjet nozzle Early life and education Martin was educated at The Royal School, Armagh, from 1980 to 1987, and was head boy in his final year. He then won a place at St Catharine's College, Cambridge to read medical science and neuroscience. He graduated with first class honours in three subjects. He qualified as a medical doctor at Oxford University in 1993. He then did medical research at several institutions in the USA and UK including: the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital and the Wilmer Eye Institute. Career He has specialised in the treatment of glaucoma and in 2005 he established the Glaucoma Research Laboratory at Cambridge. He is also an editor of the Journal of Glaucoma and treasurer of the World Glaucoma Association. In 2009 he became Cambridge University's Professor of Ophthalmology. This was a new chair, sponsored by the Cambridge Eye Trust. In 2013, he worked with Dr Barbara Lorber and others on the use of a piezoelectric inkjet nozzle to spray ganglion and glial cells from a rat retina. The cells survived the process of deposition in layers and continued to grow in culture. With further development and testing, techniques like this could have clinical application for the repair of damaged retinas. Family life Keith Martin is married and has three children. He lives in Cambridge. His wife, Susie, is better known as Dr. Susan Harden, the thoracic oncologist and Lead Clinician in Lung Cancer at Addenbrooke Hospital.

Alongside a multi-channel e-commerce platform, Dawsons boasts six high street stores across the United Kingdom, as well as a leading Education division that provides bespoke services to Colleges and Universities around the world. History Dawsons Music was established in 1898 in Warrington by John Dawson, a piano tuner, who opened the shop to cater for growing demand from people wanting to buy new instruments. The company was owned by CH & JA Dawson Ltd until 1980, when it was purchased by Thomas David Briggs MBE. In 2010, Mr Briggs was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire, responsible for a range of civic duties in the Cheshire region. Thereafter in 2011, Mark Taylor was appointed as Dawsons' new managing director. His appointment made him only the fifth managing director in the company's 115-year history. In 2014, Dawsons announced its trading results over the 2013 Christmas period were the strongest in its history, and it became one of the first retailers in the UK to report how sales from mobile devices were quickly catching up with sales from traditional online sources. In November 2018, the Briggs family sold all interest in Dawsons Music to turn-around specialist SKG Capital. In March 2019 Dawsons announced that they will close their Warrington store, ending its 121-year retail presence in the town and also its Altrincham and Huddersfield outlets. September 2019 saw announcements by Dawsons Music with regards to the termination of their recently promoted CEO, Mark Taylor, and also the sale of their Sankey Street head office and subsequent relocation to Centre Park. As well as the new headquarters the company revealed an updated logo and their ambitious plans for the future. On the 20th April 2020, the board of Dawsons Music filed a Notice Of Intent to appoint Administrators (NOI), and KPMG was later appointed financial control of the business as it entered administration.

Around the central feature, which projects slightly from the frontage, is an acanthus leaf border worked in precast concrete. A white stucco frieze of interlocking discs frames the panel. There is 18,000 feet of floor space in the building arranged around an air-well. The ground floor was designed for retail. The central entrance and show windows had curved plate glass that had to be specifically made in England. Italian tiles were used in the floors throughout the building. The upper four floors, of which one complete floor was reserved for the Oriental Government Security Life Assurance Company, was used as office space and was reached by a lift and staircase at the side of the building. The basement was constructed separately, with windows fitted with sliding steel doors. The contract time for completing the structure was eight months, and the construction was to start shortly after late November 1931, with the architects reported as Messrs. Booty and Edwards, the contractors as Gammon (Malaya) Ltd., and Steen Sehested as the consulting reinforced concrete specialist. On 19 September 1936, an earthquake in northern Sumatera in the then-Dutch East Indies led to tremors also being felt in the FMS, and caused damage to the building. It was reported that the third floor wall surrounding the offices of the Oriental Government Security Life Assurance Company cracked in many places. =Lee Rubber Building= Lee Rubber Building The Lee Rubber Building or Nan Yi Building (Chinese: ÂçóÁõäÂ§ßÂé¶) sits on a prominent corner in Kuala Lumpur's Chinatown. This four-storey Art Deco building was commissioned in the early 1930s by the Lee Rubber Company, a multimillion-dollar enterprise set up by Lee Kong Chian (1893‚Äì1967), a Chinese businessman from the southern Malaysian state of Johor who was known as the 'rubber and pineapple king'. Located at the corner of Jalan Tun H. S. Lee and Jalan Hang Lekir (the former High Street and Cecil Street) in Kuala Lumpur, the Lee Rubber Building was the tallest building in KL when it was constructed. Modernist Art Deco rules this building with its striated lines and mouldings complete with differentiated corner treatment topped with a requisite flag pole. Its five-foot way is broken by solid wall-like pillars. It has a strong geometric shape that meets a corner set at a 45¬∞ angle. Like most urban Art Deco buildings, the Lee Rubber Building has a flat roof with no cornice or overhang. Its pediment still sports the original name, in English and Chinese. During World War II, it served as the headquarters of the Kempeitai (Japanese Secret Police). Later, the building became one of the branches of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation. Currently, it is the home to a branch of the Popular Bookstore, the Peter Hoe shop (selling local arts and crafts) and Kasturi Tuition Centre. Like most urban Art Deco buildings, the Lee Rubber Building has a flat roof with no cornice or overhang. In 2016, the building changed hands and as a result the building was earmarked for development by its new owners. The building was vacated, but Kuala Lumpur City Hall by-laws forbid the demolition or significant structural alteration. =Odeon Cinema= Odeon Cinema The thematic link between the Art Deco style and the new entertainment industry was also evident in the design of the Odeon Cinema (Chinese: Â••Ëø™ÂÆâÊàèÈô¢) on the corner of Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman and Jalan Dang Wangi (the former Batu Road and Campbell Road) in Kuala Lumpur. The Odeon Cinema was constructed in 1936 by the Cathay Organization. The standalone Odeon Cinema is one of the last few surviving colonial buildings in Kuala Lumpur. It has undergone various changes. It was acquired by Antenna Entertainments and operated as a cinema again between May 2011 and March 2015. Coltman was the architect and Steen Sehested prepared the reinforced concrete design. Initially the fa√ßade was coloured grey, green and white however it has faded. It was a product of golden age cinema with featured safety designs such as emergency lighting and fire prevention systems for the projector room. Ventilation grills and exhaust fans enhanced its air circulation. The foyers were laid with locally produced rubber flooring. Art Deco elements include the lettering of the building's exterior signage, vertical pylons and flagpoles. Above the entrance, a horizontal beam, embellished with a mosaic depicting drama, comedy and music, intersects the strong vertical mullions. On the side fa√ßade, ribs create a vertical rhythm. =Clock Tower= Located at the Old Market Square (Medan Pasar Besar) near LRT Masjid Jamek in Kuala Lumpur's commercial centre, the Clock Tower is a distinctive architectural landmark. The tower was built to commemorate the coronation of England's King George VI in 1937. The memorial plaques were removed following independence. The sunburst motif is common in Art Deco design and is a prominent feature on the Clock Tower. =Anglo- Oriental Building= Anglo-Oriental Building / Wisma Ekran The Anglo-Oriental Building was built in 1937 to house Anglo-Oriental (Malaya) Ltd., a subsidiary of the Anglo-Oriental Mining Corporation (later to become known as the London Tin Corporation), the general managers for a large number of tin mines in Malaya. It was constructed at the junction of Barrack and Club Roads (Jalan Tangsi and Jalan Parlimen today) in Kuala Lumpur, on the site of the former Empire Flats which had been home for many Europeans for years. The building displays a variety of Art Deco details, and represents a stylistic departure from the traditions of classical and British colonial architecture. When constructed in 1937, the building had three storeys, with an exterior made up of reinforced concrete with brick panelling. The main entrance doors were panelled with hammered pewter ‚Äì a white alloy that resembles tin. The company's name was executed in hammered pewter, another example of the architect using tin as a motif for the company. Dadoes for the staircase and entrance vestibule were made of a new material, Marbrunite, in multiple colours. A motor car garage was incorporated into the ground floor. The Anglo- Oriental building has solid tower-like features flanking the corner entranceways in addition to vertical and horizontal Art Deco patterns and lines. The vertically banded front elevation of the building, which is held between two towers, contrasts with the horizontal bands of the two side wings. The tall, first floor windows of the Anglo-Oriental Building have individual concrete canopies, while the second floor is treated as a narrow band which appears to recede due to the deep, continuous overhang above the windows and the darker shade of Shanghai plaster. An internal open courtyard was roofed over for air-conditioning in the 1960s. During the 1941 Japanese invasion, the building was used as a police station. From 1986 to 1988, the architect Chen Voon Fee renovated the Anglo-Oriental Building and it was converted into Mahkota College, a private college partnered with Boston University. From 1995 to 2005, the Anglo-Oriental Building became a property of Ekran Berhad and it served as the corporate headquarters until 1 January 2005, where the second floor housed the principal place of business of the company. It was then that the present name ‚Äì Wisma Ekran (House of Ekran) was established. =Rubber Research Institute of Malaya (R.R.I.M)= Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia Although Art Deco is seen generally in individual urban buildings, in the Rubber Research Institute Building it is employed for a complex of linked, single-storey buildings set in a landscaped compound. The buildings are almost modular with identical facade elements. Unlike most other examples, these buildings are in facing brick, with monumental corner piers. These piers frame the window openings, which are divided into three vertical bands by two large, protruding plaster mullions. Three horizontal rendered beams appear to be threaded through these mullions, visually tying the piers together. On the flat, recessed brick pediment, a plaster motif of layered latex sheets hanging out to dry is a witty allusion to the industry these buildings serve. The buildings are grouped around green courtyards and linked by covered masonry walkways. The walkways have amusing spout details over the beams which throw the rainwater from flat roofs. Art Deco is continued into the interior on heavy, carved timber doors and steel roof lights. This building shows the inventive, even playful, nature of the Art Deco style. The building was designed with a clean modern profile, and features covered walkways which border the central court and give access to all parts of the Institute. This circulation feature connects the blocks of the sprawling single-storey building. The buildings are all made of brick and reinforced concrete with an exterior finishing of plaster and brick. The roof over the vestibule and the library is made of a special insulated glass called thermoflux. Protruding shades or eyebrows shade the glass block windows. The Institute's charge was to promote research into and investigation of all problems and matters relating to rubber. Prior to the establishment of the Rubber Research Institute of Malaya, there was no centralised location to co-ordinate and consolidate information about the material that played a central role in the Malaysian economy. Early in 1926 a request was made to the Government of the Federated Malay States to locate the institute on Bungsar Estate (archaic ‚Äì currently known as Bangsar) in Damansara Road, Kuala Lumpur. However, as early as 1929 it was felt that the buildings occupied by the Institute were inadequate as the Institute's permanent home. The institute was subsequently relocated at 260 Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur in the heart of the national capital on 14 May 1937. The new building is the property of the Institute and was erected at the cost of around $200,000. The foundation stone was laid by the fifth Sultan of Selangor ‚Äì Sultan Sir Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah on 22 April 1936. The contractor of the building is Bong Sin, with the consulting engineer as Steen Sehested and Coltman as the architect. The structure bears more than a passing resemblance to Frank Lloyd Wright's Imperial Hotel, Tokyo, in its details and overall layout. If this was explicit on the part of Coltman, it would be a most unusual apparition of Prairie Style in South East Asia, and an indication of the architect's ability to work within many stylistic parameters, a flexibility he exhibited throughout his long and distinguished career. Coltman is known for his role in establishing one of the largest firms in the area, and for his part in bringing modernism to the Federated States of Malaya, later Malaysia. =OCBC Building= OCBC Building This building was designed by Coltman and built in 1937 to house the headquarters of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited in Malaysia, and is a masterpiece of the Art Deco style. Located at the junction of Jalan Hang Kasturi and Leboh Pasar Besar (just behind the Central Market), it has the advantage of double frontage. The three-storey building follows the curve of the road. Unlike other Art Deco facades, the corner of the building is not accentuated due to the recessed entrance and the regularly spaced windows that flow across the facade. At one end is a tapering stepped pylon with a flagpole on top. A muted mosaic panel runs up the centre of the pylon. It included underground parking for bicycles. Internally, an interesting feature is an old elevator with brass and wood fittings and an oversized round window. The main OCBC Bank branch is now newly located at Jalan Tun Perak. =Harrisons & Crosfield Building= =Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin Mosque, Brunei= Honours and awards 1953 President of the Malayan Association of Architects * 1946 Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.) for service during World War II as part of the Passive Defence Service in Kuala Lumpur *1951 3rd prize in a competition for designing the new $2 million Post Office Savings Bank in Kuala Lumpur (B.M.

Company  Algolia was founded in 2012 by Nicolas Dessaigne and Julien Lemoine, who are originally from Paris, France. It was originally a company focused on offline search on mobile phones. Later it was selected to be part of Y Combinator's Winter 2014 class. Starting with two data centres in Europe and the US, Algolia opened a third centre in Singapore in March 2014, and as of 2019, claimed to be present in over 70 data centers across 16 worldwide regions. It serves roughly 7,500+ customers, handling 60 billion user queries per month. In May 2015, Algolia received $18.3M in a series A investment from a financial group led by Accel Partners, and in 2017 a $53M series B investment, also led by Accel Partners. From June 2016 to September 2019, the usage of Algolia by small websites has increased from 632 to 5,168 in the \\"top 1 million websites\\" and 197 in the \\"top 10k websites\\" evaluated by BuiltWith.  Products and Technology  The Algolia model provides search as a service, offering web search across a client's website using an externally hosted search engine. Although in-site search has long been available from general web search providers such as Google, this is typically done as a subset of general web searching. The search engine crawls or spiders the web at large, including the client site, and then offers search features restricted to only that target site. This is a large and complex task, available only to large organisations at the scale of Google or Microsoft. Algolia's product only indexes their clients' sites and so the search task is far simpler. Data for the client site is pushed from the client to Algolia via a RESTful JSON API, then the search box is added simply to the client's web pages. This search model is intended to give the performance and sophistication advantages of a full in-house search engine operating on the native web site back-end database, but with the simplicity of setup of using a site-restricted Google search. =Products= Algolia claims a number of advantages for their approach, including speed of response from searching a single site rather than the entire web. Moreover, as Algolia's search can be tailored to the client site, its known structure and its metadata facets, the search offered can be smarter and more site-specific than a generalised web text search. This improves the relevance of search results as searching may take the semantics of site content into account. A web site selling both puppies and dog clutches could avoid the search confusions and homonymy that bedevil the simple text-based search approaches. Algolia emphasize their ability to provide instantaneous, multi-platform and typo-tolerant features. Algolia's software is closed source. They do however contribute to the open source community to an extent. Two examples are Algolia Place and Algolia Document. =API= Algolia provides their search service via various APIs. The Rest API provides basic features of search, analysis and monitoring. There are 10 supported languages and platforms for client usage. Supported languages include Python, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, Java, Go, C#, Scala. Two mobile platforms, iOS, Android, are supported. Algolia can be also integrated with four web frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Symfony, Django and Laravel. For user interface, Algolia has a few UI libraries options to choose from. Besides these products, Algolia also has integration with other open source and third- party software, including Drupal, WordPress and Magento. = Infrastructure= Algolia documented one attempt to remove all single points of failure in their architecture and proposed a worldwide infrastructure called Distributed Search Network to efficiently reply to a search query from any location. The DSN feature allows to set the locations in Algolia's network where the data should be duplicated. The API and queries are routed from the end-user's browser or mobile application to the closest location in the network. That setup helped reduce processing latency for the end users, and improves availability for their searches.

It was first described by Belgian ichthyologist Hubert Matthes in 1959, from specimens collected from Lake Tanganyika at Kalundu, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The species name \\" irsacae\\" is derived from the abbreviation \\"I.R.S.A.C.\\", or Institut pour la Recherche Scientifique en Afrique Centrale. For many years, specimens the species were considered to be juvenile members of S. dhonti, but in 2006, J.J. Wright and L.M. Page identified unique characteristics of this species that established that they were a unique species.  Description  Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. irsacae has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin. The head is about of the standard length of the fish. The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process. The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. irsacae, the humeral process is long, narrow, and rough, with a poorly defined ridge on the bottom edge. The top edge is concave and the end is a rounded point. It is almost of the length of the head. The diameter of the eye is about of the length of the head. The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel has a distinct membrane attached near the base and is straight without any branches. It extends as far or just past the base of the pectoral fin, about three quarters of length of the head. The outer pair of mandibular barbels extends just short of the front of the pectoral girdle, about of the length of the head, and contains two to seven short branches, with secondary branches sometimes present. The inner pair of mandibular barbels is about half as long as the outer pair, about of the length of the head, with four to five pairs of branches, with secondary branches present. The skin of S. irsacae has a large number of tiny vertical skin folds. The exact purpose of the skin folds is not known, but is a characteristic of the species of Syndontis that are endemic to Lake Tanganyika. External papilla are present on the head, but not the body. The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines. In S. irsacae, the spine of the dorsal fin is short, about as long as the head, slightly curved, rough on the front and serrated on the back, and ends with short, dark filament. The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven branching rays. The spine of the pectoral fin is slightly curved, about as long as the dorsal fin spine, rough on the front and with large serrations on the back. The pectoral spine ends in short, dark filament. The rest of the pectoral fins are made up of eight to nine branching rays. The adipose fin does not contain any rays, is long and well developed, and has a convex shape. The pelvic fin contains one unbranched and six branched rays. The front edge of the pelvic fin is vertically aligned halfway between the back edge of the dorsal fin and the origin of the adipose fin. The anal fin contains three to five unbranched and seven to nine branched rays; it is vertically aligned with the first third of the adipose fin. The tail, or caudal fin, is forked, with rounded lobes, and contains eight rays on the upper lobe, nine rays on the lower lobe. The mouth of the fish faces downward and has wide lips that contain papilla. All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth. In some species, this toothpad is made up of a large patch with several rows in a large cluster. In other species of Syndontis, this toothpad is clearly divided into two separate groups, separated by a thin band of skin that divides the toothpad. This character is used as a method of differentiating between two different but similar species of Syndontis. In S. irsacae, the toothpad is interrupted, or separated into two distinct groups. On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \\"s-shaped\\" or \\"hooked\\". The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. irsacae, there are 15 to 29 teeth on the mandible, arranged in a single row. Some of the species of Synodontis have an opening or series of openings called the axillary pore. It is located on the sides of the body below the humeral process and before the pectoral fin spine. The exact function of the port is not known to scientists, although its presence has been observed in seven other catfish genera. Fish in the genus Acrochordonichthys are known to secrete a mucus with toxic properties from their axillary pore, but there is no scientific consensus as to the exact purpose of the secretion or the pore. S. irsacae does not have an axillary pore. The back of the fish is gray-brown to copper-brown. The underside is slightly lighter. Juveniles have scattered, irregularly-shaped spots on the body that become smaller with age. Most of the species of Synodontis of Lake Tanganyika have a recognizable pattern consisting of dark triangles at the bases of all of the rayed fins, present in S. irsacae when young, and the back edges of the fins are white in color.

The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females. Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning. As a whole, species of Synodontis are omnivores, consuming insect larvae, algae, gastropods, bivalves, sponges, crustaceans, and the eggs of other fishes. The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.

Location The location of Sackville Street within London. The street runs between Vigo Street in the north and Piccadilly in the south. It has no other exits. History Sackville Street on a 1742 plan. The land on which Sackville Street stands, like Albany and Burlington House, was formerly known as Stone Conduit Close. It was bounded on one side by Penniless Bank and on the other by Swallow Close. It passed into Crown ownership in 1536 and formerly belonged to the Abbot and Convent of Abingdon. The land was then much divided, leases granted and ended and ownership changed several times.\\"Sackville Street\\" Survey of London, Volumes 31 and 32: St James Westminster, Part 2 (1963), pp. 342-366. Retrieved 6 June 2014. Sackville Street is first mentioned in the Ratebooks in 1679. By 1730 the former leases on the land that is currently Sackville Street had all expired and William Pulteney, later the Earl of Bath, had the site cleared in order to rebuild the street. The rebuilding laid out the street according to the former leasehold divisions with the houses on the west side corresponding with Richard Bull's former lease, and the roadway and eastern side houses corresponding with the former interests of Edward Bew and Robert Chipp. On 1 May 1730, Pulteney signed an agreement with Thomas Phillips of St. George's, carpenter, and John Mist of St. Anne's paviour. These were likely the principal contractors for the construction of the houses, and by 1733 most of the houses were completed. From the start the street attracted a mixed occupancy and included fine homes and shops. At the time of building it included two apothecaries, a cheesemonger, a tavern and a coffee house. Tailors were also prominent, including 13 listed in the Post Office directory of 1830.

With his pioneering approach to retail trade and advanced manufacturing methods he was able to make his way on three continents where, from 1931 to 1939, he was progressively developing a network of more than 130 retail shops of large capacity and several tens of business representations and plants. He was the first to vertically integrate the sale of ready-made clothing from the manufacturing process to retail, and thus he showed the way to current luxury houses such as Chanel and Hermes. He implemented many innovative approaches into practice which were also used by Ford or Bata. His products were at the top of the textile tradition in the Czechoslovak Republic which had begun in 1858 with the first plant for ready-made clothing in Europe built right in Nehera's hometown of Prostƒõjov. This tradition is still alive in many garment factories in Prostƒõjov or Trenƒç√≠n.  Business Beginnings  After Nehera had finished his formation to become a locksmith and completed his basic military training, in 1923, with the help of his father and two partners he established his first factory carrying the name Nehera a spol. After several years, both the father and son left the factory in order to establish their own family business. They were producing men's and children's ready-made clothes which they supplied to traders. In its beginnings, the business located in Prostƒõjov had 9 permanent employees and 50 tailors working at home.  Change of the Business Model  Around 1929, Nehera started contemplating the sale of ready- made clothes in his own stores. He was inspired by Bata's style of doing business and also borrowed his idea of prices ending in nines. The opening of his first independent store in Prague at Wenceslas Square in 1931 was accompanied by an extensive advertising campaign with the slogan ‚Äúdirectly from the manufacturer to the consumer‚Äù. The campaign reached people so well that, according to the archives, the turnover in the first stores climbed to 100,000 Czechoslovak korunas a day. The opening of own stores gave him the opportunity for selling directly to customers. Nehera was one of the few businessmen who managed not only to flourish at the beginning of the 1930s during the economic crisis, but he even extended the scope of his services. This was so mainly thanks to the full vertical integration of the whole logistic chain, from the production of ready-made clothes to their retail selling, in own factories and own stores.  Progressive Approach to Business  The difference between Nehera and his competition that had a substantially longer tradition was in particular that, unlike Nehera, they were not able to catch a new business trend early or their production was too narrowly specialised. Only a few people paid very much attention to promotion like Nehera. Alongside a massive campaign, frequent discounts and sales or Bata prices ending in nine, he also published a company magazine in order to motivate his employees. Moreover, Nehera did not resist extending his services. In addition to selling women's, men's, and children's ready-made clothes, the company also started to offer the tailoring of clothes of its customers as well as the services of public ironing in stores. In larger towns, mobile ironing stations were deployed, parking e.g. in front of football stadiums. Approximately in the first half of the 1930s, Nehera began providing tailored clothing with a 10% surcharge on the standard price.  A Period of Prosperity  In the course of three years, the domestic distribution network extended enormously and therefore, it was necessary to deal with the rationalisation of the production itself. Nehera went on a study trip to the USA where he absorbed Henry Ford‚Äôs know-how. In 1935, Nehera was already employing 1,000 people and the number of stores increased to 76. In the second half of the 1930s, when the domestic sales network saw its most productive times, the company's sales reached nearly 20,000,000 Czechoslovak korunas a month. The increased number of employees resulted in the lack of qualified workforce and, therefore, in 1937 Nehera established a boarding school for adolescents.  Expanding Abroad  From 1936, alongside domestic stores, foreign affiliated branches were gradually coming into existence, e.g. in Stockholm, Sweden, Oslo, Norway, and in Africa. Stores in northern Europe were managed by local inhabitants, while Czechoslovak employees were sent to Africa. In 1940, Nehera established a new factory in Trenƒç√≠n which later changed to Ozeta. Nehera's company also exported its goods to cities with no direct representation. His clothes set fashion trends in such European cities as Moscow, Z√ºrich, Vienna, Paris, and Amsterdam.  Public Contracts  Apart from his own sales network, Nehera also tried to obtain public contracts with important institutions. The business was successful in this field as well, as it was awarded a relatively extensive contract for the supply of clothes for the Czechoslovak Army.  Emigration to Casablanca  After WWII, Nehera faced many problems with the Nazis to whom he lost his factory, he was arrested and imprisoned. After the war, in 1945, his company was nationalized and became a part of the state-owned company OP Prostƒõjov. Therefore, Nehera decided to emigrate to Casablanca, Morocco, where he managed to establish a smaller garment factory before his death due to kidney disease in 1958. 1) Moravsk√Ω zemsk√Ω archiv v Brnƒõ (d√°le jen MZA), fond Jan Nehera, odƒõvn√≠ slu≈æba, Prostƒõjov 1933-1946. 2) MZA, f.

He made many contributions to Sikh theology and Sikh literature, he discovered Hemkunt, and he became the Sri Mahant (head) of the Nirmal Pachchayati Akhara at Kankhal.  Biography  Pundit Tara Singh was born into a Sikh family who were originally Brahmins. At the age of twenty he left his village, which was near Qadian, and he arrived at the Niramala dera of Sant Gulab Singh at Kurala, Hoshiarpur. Here he was initiated into the Niramala order and taught the Sikh texts and scriptures. For further learning he went to Amritsar and also to Kashi where he studied Sanskrit and Vedic literature. He then spent some time in the Bengali city of Shantipur. He also attended the Arddha Kumbha 1861 at Haridwar. He was now a renowned scholar and had accumulated some fame throughout the region. The Maharaja of Patiala, Maharaja Narinder Singh (1824‚Äì1862) gave patronage to him after which Tara Singh came to Patiala and established his own Nirmala dera by the name of Dharam Dhuja and began doing scholarly work. Pundit Tara Singh taught a large group of scholars which include the famous Sikh historian Giani Gain Singh (1822‚Äì1921) and Bishan Singh Ji Muralewale of the Damdami Taksal. Sant Attar Singh (1822‚Äì1927) also studied from a Nirmala sect during this time. In 1875 Pundit Tara Singh was made the Sri Mahant (head) of the Nirmal Pachchayati Akhara (Kankhal), the central organisation of the Nirmala sect. = Sri Gur Tirath Sangrah = Maharaja Narinder Singh of Patiala commissioned to Pandit Tara Singh Narotam to compile a comprehensive list of all the gurudwaras commemorating the life and work of the Gurus. This work was entitled Sri Gur Tirath Sangrah and published in 1884. Pundit Tara Singh provided the descriptions of 508 different locations and Hemkunt was of one of these. = Finding Hemkunt = Hemkunt Lake Pundit Tara Singh was the first Sikh to trace the geographical location of Hemkunt Sahib. Using clues from the Bachitar Natak to reveal Guru Gobind Singh's tap asthan (place of meditation) such as the place was named Sapatsring (seven peaks) and was on or near Hemkunt Parbat (lake of ice mountain) he set out to explore the Garhwal Himalayas and his search took him to Badrinath and to the nearby village of Pandukeshwar, near the present-day Gobind Ghat. It seems, however, that Narotam's discovery was not heeded by the Sikh community until the twentieth century, when Hemkunt was rediscovered Sohan Singh and Modan Singh. Gurbani Interpretation Pundit Tara Singh conforms to the Nirmala school of thought. He presents Sikhism from a Vedantic orientation, and it being a blend of Sankara and Ramanuja. He believed that Guru Nanak Dev was an incarnation of Vishnu and that Waheguru was another name of Vishnu and could not refer to the nirguna concept of God. He wrote extensively about the meaning of Waheguru in his book Waheguru Shabad-Arth Tika. In the Mahan Kosh it is written that Pandit Tara Singh believes that the Sarbloh Granth was produced by Bhai Sukha Singh the head Granthi of Patna Sahib from a manuscript given by an Udasi from Shri Jagannathpuri (Odisha) who said it was Guru Gobind Singh's writing.

Her 2007 (re-published in 2011) book Mau Moko: the world of Maori tattoo, co-authored with Linda Waimarie Nikora, was the product of a five-year long research project conducted by the MƒÅori and Psychology Research Unit at Waikato University, funded by a Marsden Fund grant. Te Awekotuku took a moko kauae (facial moko) to mark the death of Te Arikinui Dame te Atairangikaahu in 2006. Research into the MƒÅori way of death In 2009 Te Awekotuku and Linda Waimarie Nikora received a $950,000 Marsden Fund grant as lead researchers in the MƒÅori and Psychology Research Unit at Waikato University for the research project 'Apakura: the Maori way of death'. A further $250,000 was received from the Nga Pae o te Maramatanga National Institute of Research Excellence to explore past and present practices around tangihanga.  Visitors permit denial  In 1972, Te Awekotuku was denied a visitors permit to the USA on the grounds that she was a homosexual. Publicity around the incident was a catalyst in the formation of Gay Liberation groups in New Zealand. This may have been related to a TV interview she gave in 1971, in which she described herself as a 'sapphic woman'.

The congress is the highest organ of the party, and is stipulated to be held every four years. A total of 801 delegates represented the party's 336,399 members. The 1st Central Committee, elected by the congress, elected Kim Tu-bong as WPNK Chairman, Kim Il-sung and Chu Yong-ha as deputy chairmen. Delegates Elected by the party's provincial apparatus, 801 delegates represented 336,399 party members at the congress. Of the delegates, 229 were in their twenties, 417 in their thirties, 129 delegates in their forties, and 26 delegates in their fifties or above. By occupation, 183 of the delegates were classified by the central party apparatus as workers, 157 as peasants, 385 as office workers, and 76 were left unclassified. The majority (359) of the delegates had only high school education, while 228 had only primary education and 214 had college education or above. During Japanese rule, 291 delegates (36 percent) had been imprisoned, while 427 delegates (53 percent) had stayed abroad during Japanese rule. Congress =1st session (28 August)= The 1st session was presided over by Kim Il-sung (the former chairman of the Communist Party of North Korea), and lasted for three hours. The first order of business was to elect the officers of the congress; a thirty-one member executive committee, a five- member credentials committee, a four-member secretariat, a five-member editorial committee, a five-member platform committee and a five-member by- laws committee. In tandem, the delegates voted on a six-point agenda for the congress. Ho Kuh-bong, a delegate from Hamgyong-Pukto, proposed making Joseph Stalin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), the honorary chairman of the congress, as a thanks for the Soviet Union's contribution to liberating Korea from Japan and for future help in supporting the construction of Korea. Delegates from the Democratic Youth League of North Korea, the North Korean General Federation of Labour Unions, the North Korean Federation of the Peasants Associations and the Korean Democratic Party gave congratulatory remarks to the party. After these speeches, the 1st session was adjourned. =2nd session (29 August)= The 2nd session was presided over by Kim Tu-bong, the former leader of the New People's Party (which consisted of Korean communists from China), and the session \\"lasted from nine in the morning to seven in the evening.\\" The meeting commenced with a statistical report from Pak Il-u, a member of the Yanan faction, about the composition of the delegates. Kim Il-sung and Kim Tu-bong addressed the congress with the main speeches of the day. Kim Il-sung condemned the nationalist leaders in South Korea, criticizing by name Kim Gu and Syngman Rhee, and the general standard of living in the southern half under American occupation. He then outlined the reason for the establishment of the WPNK, claiming the democratic strength of the working class as its purpose. His speech also condemned the former members of the Communist Party of North Korea who opposed the merger of the party with the New People's Party (to establish the WPNK), declaring that those communists who opposed the merger \\"were a small group of arrogant leftists who thought they were the only true Communists in Korea.\\" He further added that the merger would only strengthen the progressive forces in the country, while in tandem making sure that the WPNK leadership would ensure ideological unity within the party. Kim Tu-bong's speech was similar to Kim Il-sung's; he criticized those members of the New People's Party who opposed the merger with the Communist Party of North Korea (claiming that these members had committed the error of right opportunism). He concluded his speech by outlining a five-point agenda to strengthen the newly established party. The merger had, as outlined by both Kim Il-sung and Kim Tu-bong, angered several members within both parties. However, Colonel Alexander Ignatiev of the Soviet Civil Authority, who was the mastermind behind the merger, attended the congress to ensure its success. Of the 801 delegates, 15 discussed the two speeches; the discussions were concluded with a remark from Kim Il-sung who approved of the merger. AFter a brief discussion, a resolution was passed which approved of the merger, named the new party the \\"Workers' Party of North Korea\\" (which was designated as the party of the working masses) and a thirteen article platform suggested by Choe Chang-ik. The congress was then adjourned for the day. =3rd session (30 August)= The 3rd, and last, session was presided over by Chu Yong-ha, a member of the domestic faction. Kim Yong-bom, a member of the domestic faction, was in charge of drafting the party's by-laws; the party's proposed by-laws were approved after a \\"brief discussion\\". Then Tae Song-su, a member of the Soviet-Korean faction, proposed the merger of Chongno (Correct Path) and Chonjin (Forward), the newspapers of the Communist Party of North Korea and the New People's Party respectively, and the creation of Rodong Sinmun (Workers' Daily), as the WPNK's main newspaper. The proposal was approved by the congress. The last speech was given by Choe Chang-ik from the Workers' Party of South Korea (WPSK). He talked about the situation for the South Korean communist movement, the establishment of the WPSK, and the WPSK's decision to expel six dissident elements who had opposed the Communist Party of South Korea's merger with other progressive forces. The merger and the expulsion of the six members were approved by the congress. Last on the agenda was the election of the 1st Central Committee (CC) and the 1st Inspection Commission (IC). A prepared list for nominees for the CC and IC was approved beforehand by the party leadership, and approved by the congress delegates. The 43 nominees to the CC and the 11 nominees to the IC were approved unanimously \\"after each nominee was introduced.\\" Of the members elected to the 1st Central Committee, 13 belonged to the domestic faction, 12 to the Yanan faction, 6 to the Soviet-Korean faction, 4 belonging to Kim Il-sung's partisan faction, and the affiliation of the remaining 8 members was unknown. The congress, after issuing an open letter to the people of Korea, then adjourned. 1st plenum of the 1st Central Committee =The merger= The merger of the Communist Party of North Korea and the New People's Party was met with lukewarm response within the two parties. What became evident to all observers was that few if any Korean communists wanted to create a mass party (as the Soviets insisted), and the leadership of Kim Il-sung was not accepted by the majority in the communist movement at the time. Kim Il-sung had been appointed to leadership by the Soviets, rather than being promoted by his associates. Leading figures from the New People's Party, such as Kim Tu-bong, Mu Chong and Choe Chang-ik, were far more popular with the Korean people then Kim Il-sung; Kim retained his position because the Soviets made it clear that opposition to Kim meant opposition to the Soviet Civil Authority (the Soviet administration in North Korea). Presumably, for this reason alone leading officials at the 1st Congress began adoring Kim Il-sung with compliments; Pak Pyong-so remarked that the Koreans needed a leader and accused everyone opposing Kim Il-sung of being a reactionary. Pak Chong-ae, a delegate from Pyongnam, claimed that Pak Pyong-so's comments were unnecessary since Kim Il-sung \\"was already recognized as the leader of the entire Korean people.\\" It was because of the Soviets that Kim Il-sung was able to preside over the congress, delivering the political report and presenting the nominees to the Central Committee and the Inspection Commission. His rivals acquiesced to Kim Il-sung's domineering because of the Soviets; the leaders of the rival factions, the Soviet-Korean, domestic and Yanan factions played a small role in the congress' affairs. =Election= The 1st Plenary Session of the 1st Central Committee convened after the 1st Congress on 31 August. It elected the 1st Political Committee (composed of five members), the party's chairman (who concurrently has to serve as a member of the Political Committee) and two deputy chairmen. Why the members of the Central Committee did not elect Kim Il-sung chairman is unknown; either Kim Il-sung gave the position to Kim Tu-bong as an honorary position, or the Central Committee members who voted in a secret ballot chose their most preferred candidate. Whatever the case, Kim Tu-bong's ascension to the top party position did not reflect his real power, and Kim Il-sung was the de facto leader under Kim Tu-bong's chairmanship. Kim Il-sung and Chu Yong-ha were elected the party's deputy chairmen, while Ho Ka-i, a Soviet Korean, and Choe Chang-ik, from the Yanan faction, together with the other three were elected to the 1st Political Committee.

The species is best known for causing a tumor known as crown gall disease. One of the virulent strains, A. vitis S4, is responsible both for crown gall on grapevines and for inducing a hypersensitive response in other plant species. Grapevines that have been affected by crown gall disease produce fewer grapes than unaffected plants. Though not all strains of A. vitis are tumorigenic, most strains can damage plant hosts. A. vitis shares many genetic and morphological characteristics with several Agrobacterium species, including A. tumefaciens. The two species have overlapping host ranges, and both A. vitis and A. tumefaciens may reduce the yield of infected crops. For this reason, research on A. vitis focuses on transmission and methods of control. Biology =Identification= A. vitis is a Gram-negative bacterium with a thin peptidoglycan layer in its cell wall. The species is aerobic and mesophilic, with individual cells that are rod-shaped and motile. On culture, colonies are round, white, and translucent. =Range and environment= The presence of A. vitis has been confirmed in Germany, France, Austria, Hungary, South Africa, and the United States. Crown gall disease outbreaks in Europe and North America in the mid-1980s have been linked to A. vitis, and the species has continued to survive in those regions. Additionally, a survey conducted in China from 2003-2009 identified strains of A. vitis on blighted banana plants. Genetic traits =Chromosome and plasmids= The genome of A. vitis consists of two circular chromosomes and five plasmids. It is 6.32 Mb long and encodes 5549 proteins. Four rRNA operons have been identified. Tumorigenic strains contain a Ti plasmid (pTi). Ti plasmids in galls produce various opines that are then secreted from the gall. In a vitis, pTi codes for octopine and/or cucumopine. Tumorigenic strains also contain a plasmid that allows the bacterium to utilize tartrate. =Classification= A. vitis was formerly referred to as Agrobacterium biovar III. Originally, the species included only biovar III strains found in grape hosts. Since then, A. vitis has been redefined to include all biovar III strains. It can be distinguished from biovars I and II, A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes, on the basis of its hosts and pathogenicity. Fatty acid analysis also reveals differences between A. vitis and other strains of tumorigenic bacteria. A. vitis has also been classified in the genus Rhizobium. A 1999 study suggested that A. vitis is more closely related to Rhizobium galegae than to other Agrobacterium species, based on genetic sequence comparison. In 2001, Young et al. proposed that A. vitis be reclassified as Rhizobium vitis. More recently, A. vitis was transferred to the genus Allorhizobium. Pathogenicity =Hosts= Grapevines are the plants most commonly infected with A. vitis. Though A. vitis may cause hypersensitive response in other plant species, crown gall disease induced by tumorigenic A. vitis is unique to grapevines. All strains of A. vitis induce grape root necrosis. Because A. vitis may remain latent, not all infected plants show symptoms. An intraspecific taxon of A. vitis has been isolated from banana leaves in China. A. vitis may also infect tomato plants, and has been shown to cause leaf panel collapse in tobacco. =Transmission= The Ti plasmid is responsible for transmission of crown gall disease in plants infected with A. vitis. Tumorigenic A. vitis transfers its Ti plasmid to other bacteria, and transfers T-DNA into plants. Virulence genes encoded by the Ti plasmid generate single-strand T-DNA molecules, which in turn are transferred to healthy hosts. Disorganized cell division occurs in infected hosts, leading to gall development instead of the formation of healthy vascular tissue. Propagation of diseased wood often transmits A. vitis. Injuries to a grapevine caused by cutting or freezing may also make the plant more susceptible to crown gall infection. However, galls grow only on trunks or canes, and do not appear on the roots of infected plants. In Agriculture =Crown gall disease= When A. vitis causes crown gall disease, several symptoms and tests can be used to identify its presence. On grapevines, young galls appear as soft green bumps, which later become brown and rough. Galls do not appear on all grapevines in which A. vitis is present. Steps can be taken to control crown gall disease and reduce the risk of infection. Injured sites on vines, such as those caused by freezing or cutting injuries, are especially susceptible to infection. Planting in frost-prone areas or areas with poor drainage should therefore be avoided. Reducing other grapevine stressors, such as nutrient deprivation and low soil pH, also limits susceptibility. Additionally, some cultivars are resistant to crown gall disease. Vitis vinifera is generally susceptible to crown gall disease, but resistant grape species can be planted preferentially. =Other diseases= Grape necrosis is a common symptom of A. vitis infection, caused by both tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic bacteria strains. Tobacco leaf panel collapse can be induced by the non-tumorigenic F2/5 strain of A. vitis. While the strain of A. vitis found in grapevines, A. vitis pv. vitis, is responsible for most diseases, banana leaf blights have been linked to A. vitis pv. musae. =Nonpathogenic strains= Strains of bacteria can be used as biological control agents to limit the growth of pathogenic A. vitis. Grapevine roots that have been soaked in a suspension containing the inhibitory strain are less susceptible than those that have not. Several ACC deaminase-producing species found in the rhizosphere inhibit A. vitis tumor production in tomato plants. Non-tumorigenic strains of A. vitis (F2/5, ARK-1, and VAR03-1) have been shown to limit crown gall formation. In investigations involving these strains, F2/5 still induced necrosis but ARK-1 did not.

Biography Kalle L√∏chen was born in F√•berg (now Lillehammer), in Oppland, Norway, the son of cand.jur. Edvard Martin L√∏chen and his wife Anne Elisabeth Gr√∏tting. He was a brother of Arne L√∏chen, Einar L√∏chen and Hjalmar L√∏ken. L√∏chen took middle school examination in 1881. He apprenticed with Wilhelm von Hanno and Knud Bergslien. He also studied with Julius Middelthun at The Royal Drawing School. During 1883‚Äì1884, he was trained by Christian Krohg and Frits Thaulow at an open air academy in Modum. In 1889, he was a pupil of L√©on Bonnat in Paris. Kalle L√∏chen debuted at the Autumn Exhibition in 1883. As an actor, he performed Hamlet at the National Theatre and also played Oswald in the Norwegian premiere of Ghosts. He was also associated with both the Tivoli and Carl Johan Theatre in Oslo. In 1886, he had married the actress, Anna Brun. He is represented in the National Gallery of Norway with the paintings Fra Kongshavn bad from 1882, Malerskolens atelier p√• Modum from 1883, and a portrait of Cecilie Thoresen Krog from 1885. On 18 March 1892, his wife, Anna L√∏chen died and he fell into a deep depression. His daughters Esther and Nanna were sent to live with extended family. L√∏chen began to drink heavily and in May 1892, he quit the theatre and left Bergen. In 1893, he returned to Eastern Norway, and after a summer stay with his sister Helene in Sollia, he went to Kristiania where he began an engagement at the newly opened Carl Johan Theatre. Later that year, he was briefly engaged to actress Anna Nielsen, but struggled emotionally with the loss of his wife the year prior and his separation from his daughters. On 20 November 1893, L√∏chen committed suicide by gunshot shot in the forest in the Oslo neighborhood of Ekeberg.

He oversaw a recovery in the Star following a crisis of both readership following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and politically after a faction fight broke out within the linked Communist Party of Britain (CPB). Prior to joining the Morning Star as a reporter in 1983 Haylett worked as an operator in international telecoms and was a grassroots representative for the Union of Post Office Workers (subsequently UCW, now part of the CWU). He had already joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) at a time when tensions were rising between its left and right factions and when he was hired, according to former colleague Roger Bagley, > ‚Äúhe ruffled the feathers of the right-wing mob ‚Ä¶ I was warned: ‚ÄòWatch out, > they‚Äôre putting this hard man in‚Äô.‚Äù Haylett subsequently worked on several desks at the paper, eventually rising to assistant editor in 1985. Three years later, the Star was thrown into crisis as its effective parent organisation, the CPGB, collapsed and was replaced by the newly-formed CPB. This was followed shortly after by the loss of thousands of bulk sales as support from the USSR was ended in 1989. As the crisis unfolded, Haylett was promoted to deputy editor the same year. The Star's readership declined to around 7,000 as it entered the early 1990s, and as the CPB struggled to re-organise rising tensions emerged between different factions of the newly-formed group over control of the paper. This revolved in particular around the question of who would succeed soon-to-be retired editor Tony Chater. Chief Executive Mary Rosser favoured news editor Paul Corry (her son-in-law) while staff and the trade unions favoured Haylett. Haylett's support base initially won out, and his appointment to the role was announced in the paper's 27 February 1995 issue, starting on 1 April of that year. The following three years saw relations between the different factions break down further however, and in 1998 many of the Star's workers ‚Äî then earning ¬£10,500 a year and with no raise for 11 years ‚Äî went on strike following the unexpected sacking of Haylett by Rosser.\\"Morning Star Strike (Channel 4 News)\\". 28 October 2006.

During World War II he served as a captain in the Volunteer Defence Corps, and worked in intelligence. Photography and research In 1922 he became associate-editor, under his father, of the Australasian Photo-Review. He exhibited his work in Australia, Europe, London and the United States of America, and in 1938 was elected an associate of the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain for a portfolio of male figure studies. That year he was appointed Australian chairman of Kodak International Salons of Photography. He edited the Australasian Photo-Review from 1943‚Äì1956. Recognizing the significance of photography to Australian history, in 1943 Burke published a series of articles on early photographers, among them William Jevons, J. W. Lindt and Charles Kerry. His wife, Iris, became his valued research assistant. In 1952 Burke located the Holtermann Collection of wet-plate negatives and recommended its donation to the Mitchell Library in Sydney; in a shed in Chatswood, New South Wales, glass plates created by Beaufoy Merlin and Charles Bayliss were ranged in 'neat stacks of cedar boxes of various dimensions, each with slotted fittings which held the large negatives in perfect preservation.' The negatives disclosed 'every detail of the lives of our gold-fields pioneers'. He devoted several issues of AP-R to the discovery. Burke provided his expertise to Jack Cato through regular correspondence as the latter was researching for his The Story of the Camera in Australia, published in 1955.first in his Acknowledgements, Cato gives prominent credit to Keast Burke, \\"editor of The Australasian Photo-Review, whose fortnightly letters over a period of four years advised, suggested, and criticised this work as it developed; who generously placed a number of historical items at my disposal, and brought the resources of Kodak (Australia) Pty.

Later life Having formally retired at 64 in 1960, from 1961 to 1969 Burke was the first editor and then art director of Australian Popular Photography (later named Australian Photography), a contributor to the Australian Dictionary of Biography and a frequent judge of photographic competitions. As consultant in photography to the National Library of Australia, Canberra, he oversaw the preservation of historic photographs. He later published Gold and silver : an album of Hill End and Gulgong photographs from the Holtermann Collection in 1973.

It was named after Rushall railway station, located near the home of band member Vincent Giarrusso in Clifton Hill in Melbourne. Background The album was the first to be released on the band's own label, Mainstream Recordings, following their departure from Polydor. It was recorded and mixed in 10 days for less than $5000 and the band did their own promotion and marketing. Singer Vincent Giarrusso said: \\"We found on Polydor that we had to fit in with marketing plans and a lot of other bands. It's kind of good if you can stand it, but there were two years between Leaves Me Blind and Dream it Down, so it was a bit too frustrating. We want to put out one a year, at least.\\" He said the band had also been unsettled by Polydor's plans for the follow-up to Dream It Down, their second album for the label, which had suffered from poor sales despite critical acclaim. Giarrusso told the Herald Sun that after giving Polydor a demo tape of its new songs, the band learned the label planned to hire a big-name producer and turn the album into an epic. \\"We wrote a letter to the lawyer,\\" he said, \\"and told him we weren't happy with the way it was going, and could we be released from our contract?\\" Giarrusso said the album could have been recorded in even less time than its 10 days. \\"We were in a studio that broke down half way through. We knew what we wanted to achieve, there was room to improvise within the songs, but we kept the song arrangements simple. It's quite different. The last two albums we did had a lot more layering of guitars, synthesisers and acoustic instruments to get a thicker, more lush sound. This time we went for a minimalist approach.\\" After performing on two tracks, singer Philippa Nihill left the band during recording to pursue a solo career; her debut solo EP, Dead Sad, was released on Mainstream in November 1996. Giarrusso said one of Nihill's songs for Rushall Station, \\"Song of Another Love\\", had traces of Englilsh trip hop band Portishead. \\"We tried to treat that track like a traditional ballad, but it's got an eerie feel about it. Philippa's delivery was something we had never heard before from her. She's been listening to a lot of Celtic music lately‚ÄîI don't know why‚Äîbut I think there's that sort of inflection in her voice.\\" \\"In My Head\\" and \\"Takes You Back\\"/\\"Undone\\" were released as singles. The album was nominated for best Australian independent release at the ARIA Music Awards of 1996.

Plot Two rival brothers are looking for the magic ring of the Nibelungen, a mystical jewel that confers all power to the one who possesses it. The first, Karl, is an archaeologist who wishes to give it to an archaeological institute and the second, Franz, is a materialist who wants to appropriate it to be rich and powerful. Franz, after having read Karl's research, travels to the Carpathian Mountains in Transylvania, to the ancient castle of Count Dracula. The innkeeper's daughter tells him that on the first full moon night of the summer that five virgin girls from the village are chosen by the powers of evil and taken to the castle to be sacrificed, and that the place was infested with vampires. She gives Franz an amulet for protection. After spending the night with the girl, Franz leaves her to go to the castle but forgets to take the amulet. In the manner of Count Dracula, he is greeted by the housekeeper, Lara, and meets Countess Dolingen De Vries, the count's widow. The countess uses the famous ring to bring girls home to kill them and then to bathe in their blood. Bewitched and bitten by her, Franz immediately marries her. Their marriage is followed by the sacrifice of five girls. Equally looking for the ring, Karl arrives in turn in Transylvania but does not know his brother was vampirized by the Countess.

Smith described the film as \\"a throwback to gothic horror\\" and that it appeared to be influenced by Hammer vampire films of the 1970s, specifically Twins of Evil. Production Producer Franco Gaudenzi stated that The Devil's Wedding Night was a film that actor Mark Damon \\"wanted to do, it was a script he had, it was his creature.\\" Gaudenzi expanded on this, stating Damon was planning on selling the film to an American production company who was interested in distributing it. The screenplay is credited to Walter Bigari and Batzella, while the copy of the screenplay which is close to finished product with many technical indications only credits Batzella's name. This version of the screenplay includes a prologue which is not in the film, in which the Countess summons the forces of evil while in her castle nude women are tied to a column with their throats being slashed. When choosing the director, Gaudenzi hired Luigi Batzella, stating that he was often in their office discussing film ideas with Joe D'Amato and Bruno Mattei. The Devil's Wedding Night began shooting on July 31, 1972. It was shot on location at Castello Piccolomini in Balsorano. Gaudenzi stated that despite only Batzella getting a credit on the film, it was directed by both D'Amato and Batzella, as Gaudenzi had D'Amato reshoot some scenes. Damon was impressed with D'Amato, and recommended him to Roger Corman to work on the American production The Arena. Rosalba Neri spoke later about Batzella's direction on set stating that she \\"never understood him. It was like there were two of them, going different directions...and rarely meeting. A bit schizophrenic, indeed.\\" Release The Devil's Wedding Night was released in Italy by Florida Cinematografica on 14 March 1973. The films erotic content was cut by Italian censors who demanded that a sex scene be shortened and that \\"all scenes be eliminated where the man kisses the lower part of the woman's body.\\" The film grossed a total of 117,115,000 Italian lire domestically in Italy.

It was established at the request of the Group of Twenty (G20) in 2011. Countries participating in AMIS encompass the main producing and consuming countries of major food crops covered by the initiative: wheat, maize, rice and soybeans. AMIS is hosted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome/Italy and supported by a joint Secretariat, which currently (September 2016) consists of eleven international organizations and entities. Apart from FAO, these are the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) initiative, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the International Grains Council (IGC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Food Program (WFP), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the United Nations High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis (UN-HLTF), and the World Bank.  Background  AMIS was created as a tool to address excessive food price volatility and to strengthen global food security in a period of heightened insecurity in international food markets. Its creation is thus intrinsically linked to the two consecutive price hikes that occurred in 2007/08 and 2010. After the 2007-08 world food price crisis led to social unrest in a number of countries and drastically worsened the food security situation, the world experienced another food price shock in the summer of 2010 when the Russian Federation announced an export ban on wheat in response to a severe drought and wildfires that threatened much of the country‚Äôs crop. Under the auspices of its Intergovernmental Groups on Grains and Rice, FAO invited all its members to Rome for an extraordinary meeting in September 2010 to discuss the troubled market conditions and to stimulate a coordinated response. While the event failed to yield any immediate results, it can be credited for triggering constructive discussions that eventually led to the creation of AMIS. The meeting acknowledged that unexpected price hikes and volatility were ‚Äúamongst major threats to food security and that their root causes need to be addressed.‚Äù In particular it recognized ‚Äúthe lack of reliable and up-to-date information on crop supply and demand and export availability‚Äù as well as ‚Äúinsufficient market transparency at all levels including in relation to futures markets‚Äù among the main drivers of the most recent disturbances in world food markets.ibidem It further emphasized the need ‚Äúto enhance market information and transparency‚Äù, calling for improved ‚Äúmonitoring of planting intentions, crop development and domestic market information.‚Äùibidem These ideas were taken up during the G20 Summit in Seoul in November 2010, which asked a number of international institutions to identify the best ways to manage and mitigate risks of food price volatility without distorting markets. The ensuing report was presented to the French Presidency of the G20 in June 2011, concluding with a list of ten recommendations, among which to establish AMIS. In the final declaration of the G20 Summit in Cannes, heads of state and government of the G20 countries stressed the importance of improving \\"market information and transparency in order to make international markets for agricultural commodities more effective.\\" In order to address these challenges, they decided to launch AMIS that was officially inaugurated in September 2011.  Participating countries  AMIS participating countries Participants in AMIS include G20 countries plus Spain and seven additional major exporting and importing countries of the AMIS crops. These are: Egypt, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Philippines, Thailand, Ukraine, and Vietnam. G20 members are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European Union, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Japan, Mexico, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States.  Objectives  According to the Terms of Reference that established AMIS, the following objectives are central: * Improve agricultural market information, analysis and short-term supply and demand forecasts at both national and international levels. * Collect and analyze policy information affecting global commodity markets, and promote international policy dialogue and coordination. * Report on critical conditions of international food markets, including structural weaknesses, and strengthen global early warning capacity on these movements. * Build data collection capacity in participating countries by promoting best practices and improved methodologies, providing training to national stakeholders and facilitating the exchange of lessons learned among participating countries.  Structure  AMIS consists of three main bodies: # The Global Food Market Information Group provides and assesses market and policy information. It unites technical representatives from participating countries who meet twice per year. # The Rapid Response Forum promotes early discussion among decision- level officials about critical conditions in international food markets, and encourages the coordination of policies. It is composed of senior officials from participating countries who meet once per year, as well as when the market situation warrants international policy action. # The Secretariat produces short-term market outlooks, assessments and analyses, and supports all functions of the Forum and the Information Group. It is governed by a steering committee that includes one representative from each of the ten member organizations, namely: FAO, IFAD, IFPRI, IGC, OECD, WFP, WTO, UNCTAD, UN-HLTF, and the World Bank.

The inn, which now provides lodging only, is located in an 1835 farmhouse that is one of a regional cluster of 19th-century plank frame houses. The inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Brook Road Inn is located in a rural setting of northeastern Goshen, just west of the junction of Brook and Dubois roads. It consists of a -story plank-framed structure, to which a larger two-story ell has been attached. The original house's walls are formed structurally out of 3-inch wooden planking and covered in wooden clapboards. It is covered by a gabled roof, with gabled dormers projection from the front and a shed-roof dormer to the rear. A porch extends across the facade of the ell partially along one side. The ell's main facade is three bays wide, with an assortment of older and modern windows occupying most of the bays, and the inn's main entrance in the leftmost bay. The oldest portion of the building was built in 1835 as a farmhouse, with a small kitchen ell where the larger one now stands. It is one of a significant concentration of plank-framed houses in the area. The building was adapted for use as a hunting lodge in the 1920s, and the ell was greatly expanded in the 1950s or 1960s.

Hypersensitivity is the most important adverse effect of the penicillins. The major antigenic determinant of penicillin hypersensitivity is its metabolite, penicilloic acid, which reacts with proteins and serves as a hapten to cause an immune reaction. Approximately five percent of patients have some kind of reaction, ranging from maculopapular rash (the most common rash seen with ampicillin hypersensitivity) to angioedema (marked swelling of the lips, tongue, and periorbital area) and anaphylaxis. Among patients with mononucleosis who are treated with ampicillin, the incidence of maculopapular rash approaches 100 percent. Cross-allergic reactions occur among the Œ≤-lactam antibiotics.

He won the gold medal in the 66-kg division at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and was later selected to the Cuban team for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Throughout his sporting career, Rondon trained for the wrestling team at Cerro Pelado Sports Club in Havana, under his personal coach and mentor Filiberto Delgado. Rondon emerged himself into the global scene at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, where he pinned Colombia's Edison Hurtado on his final match to take home the gold medal in the men's welterweight division. Despite his early success from the Games, Rondon continued to reach the summit of the world rankings at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, but nearly missed out the podium after he lost the bronze medal match against Japan's Kazuhiko Ikematsu. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Rondon qualified for the Cuban team in the men's 66 kg class by receiving a berth and placing fourth from the World Championships.

The film is set in K√≥pavogur, a suburb of Reykjav√≠k strongly associated with urban legends about elves.Valdimar Tr. Hafstein, 'The Elves' Point of View: Cultural Identity in Contemporary Icelandic Elf-Tradition', Fabula: Zeitschrift f√ºr Erz√§hlsforschung/Journal of Folklore Studies/Revue d'Etudes sur le Conte Populaire, 41 (2000), 87-104 (pp. 91‚Äì93). The film takes its name from the place where spirits are said by one of the protagonists to go after death, a term attested more generally in Icelandic spiritualism.√ìlafur √ìlafsson, 'Sumarlandi√∞ (vorhuglei√∞ing)', Kirkjuriti√∞, 7 (1941), 264-68; Gu√∞mundur Kristinsson, Sumarlandi√∞: framli√∞nir l√Ωsa andl√°ti s√≠nu og endurfundum √≠ framl√≠finu, 2nd edn (Selfoss: √Årnes√∫tg√°fan, 2013). Synopsis The main character of the film is √ìskar √ìskarsson (played by Kjartan Gu√∞j√≥nsson). √ìskar's wife L√°ra (√ìlaf√≠a Hr√∂nn J√≥nsd√≥ttir) is a professional medium and, in the film's account, is aware of her past lives, able to see and talk to ghosts and to at least perceive the reality of elves. She is self-possessed, benevolent and it is implied that her business working as a medium in the local community, in which √ìskar is portrayed merely as an assistant, is a successful one. Meanwhile, √ìskar does not believe in elves and does not seem altogether convinced about ghosts. He has taken out a loan secured against the family home to create a tawdry tourist-trap called ‚ÄòGhost House‚Äô in the basement, but the business is not going well. √ìskar is portrayed as anxious, and uncomfortable in his own efforts to take on the role of a successful wheeler-dealer. He is unable to admit the family's impending bankruptcy to L√°ra, who finds out about it from the spirit of a dead person; ‚Äòvi√∞ hef√∞um aldrei √°tt a√∞ fara √∫t √≠ √æennan t√∫ristabissness‚Äô (‚Äòwe should never have gone into this tourist business‚Äô), she comments. L√°ra and √ìskar have two children: the teenager √Åsd√≠s (Hallfr√≠√∞ur Tryggvad√≥ttir), who tends to share her father's pragmatism and scepticism and later proves oblivious to the presence of ghosts, and the young boy Fl√≥ki (N√∂kkvi Helgason), who becomes best friends with a boy called √ûr√°ndur (Alexander Valur Wiium Brynj√≥lfsson) who turns out to live in the elf-stone in the family's garden; Fl√≥ki later also proves able to see and talk to ghosts. Faced with a forced sale of the house, √ìskar agrees without telling L√°ra to the unexpected offer of an ostentatiously camp, gay German art-collector called Wolfgang Muller (Wolfgang M√ºller), who is enchanted by Icelanders‚Äô credulity about elves, to buy the elf-stone in √ìskar's garden for ‚Ç¨50,000, clearing √ìskar's debts and enabling him to buy an expensive flat-screen television. However, √ûr√°ndur disappears and L√°ra falls into a coma; it later emerges that the vengeful elves have moved to a nearby elf-stone called Gr√°steinn, taking L√°ra's spirit with them. Meanwhile, the municipal authorities of K√≥pavogur are planning to sell Gr√°steinn in order to facilitate a road-widening project, despite mysterious technical problems and L√°ra's protestations. Recognising the reality of elves, √ìskar and his children join protests at the building of the road; the leader of the protest makes a speech declaring :: v√≠√∞ erum h√©r saman komin til a√∞ s√Ωna samst√∂√∞u me√∞ √°lfunum! √ûeir bygg√∞u √æetta land √° undan okkur og vi√∞ eigum a√∞ s√Ωna √æeim vir√∞ingu. √ûessi steinn er hjarta K√≥pavogs. Vi√∞ s√¶ttum okkur ekki ... vi√∞ a√∞ hann s√© ger√∞ur a√∞ s√∂luv√∂ru! :: We have come together here to show our solidarity with the elves! They inhabited this land before us and we have to show them respect. This stone is the heart of K√≥pavogur. We won‚Äôt accept ... it being made into a commodity to be sold! √ìskar lies down in front of a bulldozer whose brakes, implicitly through the intervention of the elves, fail, killing √ìskar, whereupon L√°ra awakes from her coma (somewhat disappointed to find that she has not arrived in Summerland). At √ìskar's funeral, the priest declares :: √æessi hr√¶√∞ilegi atbur√∞ur √° eftir a√∞ lifa lengi me√∞ √≠slensku √æj√≥√∞inni. Og vi√∞ √æurfum a√∞ draga l√¶rd√≥m af honum. Vi√∞ √æurfum a√∞ vi√∞urkenna √æa√∞ fyrir sj√°lfum okkur a√∞ vi√∞ b√∫um ekki ein √≠ √æessu landi.

Vi√∞ erum h√©r samankomin √≠ dag til √æess a√∞ kve√∞ja hugsj√≥na- og bar√°ttumanninn, √ìskar √ìskarsson. √ìskar fylgdi sannf√¶ringu sinni allt til enda og hvika√∞i aldrei. Hann vara√∞i vi√∞ √° me√∞an a√∞rir √æ√∂g√∞u. :: This terrible event must live long in the memory of the Icelandic people. And we have to learn from it. We have to recognise that we do not live alone in this land. And we have to treat the natural world with love and respect‚Äînot with short-term gain as our only goal. We have come here today to pay our respects to the idealist and activist √ìskar √ìskarsson. √ìskar was true to his ideals to the end and never wavered. He spoke up when others remained silent. The film ends with √ìskar's ghost returning to his family to continue a happy family life there and to haunt his own ghost-house, while √Åsis takes over the Ghost House business, which appears now to be a success. A sub-plot in the film is √Åsd√≠s's relationship with Sverrir √ûorsteinsson (Snorri Engilbertsson), chairman of the atheist organisation Andtr√∫ (Disbelief), whose views are portrayed as extremist.

She is the 21st century ancestor of Dawnstar of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Her powers are a combination of Dawnstar and Wildfire.  Fictional character biography  Wildstar was born on the planet Starhaven a planet colonized by people of Anasazi Indian heritage from Earth. The Anasazi tribe was abducted by the Athranian genetic engineers, who hoped to use them as test subjects. However, the Athranians were overthrown by Spider Guild. The Anasazi tribe were left to their own devices. The genetic experiments endow them with wings and the ability to survive in space without oxygen or protection from the rigours of space.As shown in a recent retcon in R.E.B.E.L.S. (vol. 2) #3 (June 2009); no earlier reference had been made to any specific tribe Wildstar was born a mutant of her people as she had the innate tracking ability, which manifested itself as the knack to find anyone in her village and see hidden things. However, she was also born with deformed wings, which led to her being shunned by her tribe. Mocked and ignored by her peers, she lived alone. Some time around the Final Crisis, Vril Dox came to Starhaven seeking a volunteer for his second R.E.B.E.L.S. team to combat L.E.G.I.O.N.. The chief, Chief Night Sky seeing a way to rid himself of a nuisance, sent the old woman out with the alien. Vril Dox saw great potential in her power for tracking people. Vril Dox promised her that if she comes with him and joins the team he will give her the power of flight. Wildstar with this knowledge agrees to go with the strange visitor. Subsequently, Vril Dox kept his promise, but not exactly in the way Wildstar expected. He strapped her into a machine and turned her into an anti-energy being similar to Wildfire and placed her in a containment suit which gave her the power of flight as well as powerful anti-energy blasts from her visor. They go to the planet Cairn, where L.E.G.I.O.N. has driven off Garv and Garryn Bek, but Strata and Bounder still fight on. They recruit them both on to the team and begin their investigation into Starro.R.E.B.E.L.S. #3This Ain‚Äôt Your Father‚Äôs Starro: Tony Bedard on R.E.B.E.L.S., Comic Book Resources, May 12, 2009 Powers and abilities Wildstar and the other Starhavenites are genetically altered humans that receive great gifts. Vril Dox II turned her into an anti-energy being similar to Wildfire, and placed her in a containment suit. She is now able to produce powerful anti-energy blasts from her visor. In her anti-energy form she is finally able to fly. The anti-energy is channelled out her back allowing her to construct large wings. She can survive in deep space for long periods of time without a spacesuit or oxygen. Wildstar is a master tracker and can track life forms and objects across light years of distance and through interstellar space. She can even use this ability while unconscious, asleep, under mind control, intoxicated and sensory blinded. Weakness Starhavenites normally have pairs of large, white-feathered wings that grow out of their upper backs, the result of genetic engineering. Wildstar's wings were born small and deformed causing her to be an outcast. Equipment Wildstar must wear a containment suit at all time due to her anti-energy form. The suit allows her to channel the energy into wing like constructs and the visor helps her focus the energy in to a concussive blast.

Wilson and starring Matt Borel, Gil Glasgow, and Mary Agen Cox. Its plot focuses on a group of college students staying in a cabin who tell various scary stories to one another. Plot During winter, a college student named John drives nine of his friends for a weekend trip to Lake Durand. Arriving at John's family's ramshackle cabin, the group begin to settle in. Elaine tells her boyfriend, Alan, that she wished they had not gone on the trip. John meanwhile shows Cal the nearby graves of the Durand family, who were mysterious killed at the cabin, their bodies found scattered across the property. Police surmised a gas explosion as the cause, though Native American locals believed that a powerful spirit called \\"Shataba,\\" which roams the woods in winter, caused their deaths. That night, the friends start a fire in the hearth and begin telling scary stories. John tells the tale of the \\"Moss Point Man,\\" a dwarf-like creature that terrorized a local couple on a date: After running out of gasoline on a country road, Roger left his girlfriend in the car while he walked toward a station. Some time later, she heard scraping on the roof of the car, and discovered Roger hanging dead from a tree. The following morning, the woman was found alive, with human teeth marks on her ankles. After finishing the story, John shows Cal a newspaper clipping about a bizarre accident that happened at Lake Durand in the 1940s. Next, Steve tells the group the story of the \\"Green Light,\\" in which three fraternity pledges were instructed to spent the night in a supposedly haunted, abandoned hotel. The three men were warned not to venture to the upper levels of the building, but ultimately did so while investigating a noise; in the morning, the fraternity found the three men in a trance-like state, two of them bleeding, and the third driven mad. After Steve's story, one of the women, Jookie, becomes unnerved and wishes to leave the cabin. Outside, a howling wind begins to increase in frequency. John and Steve say they are going to town to purchase more oil for the lamps, and instead terrify Sally and Liz by posing in a grotesque gorilla mask int the kitchen window. The aloof Elaine decides to share a story that supposedly happened at her high school: It involves a timid woman named Annie who suffered a date rape attempt, in which she stabbed the attacker to death. Annie claimed a madman had attacked her and her date, absolving her of public guilt, though she grew mentally unbalanced after the incident. Later, in college, a withdrawn Annie brutally murders her dormitory roommate for wearing Annie's shawl without her permission. Jookie, horrified by Elaine's story, grows frantic. Her boyfriend Harper tries to calm her, and the group contemplate whether they should leave. The wind increasingly rattles the cabin, howling violently. Fearing that the Shataba legend John told him might be true, Cal departs with his girlfriend, Lauri. Suddenly, the wind shatters the living room window, and Elaine is killed by shards of glass. Cal, Lauri, Harper, and Jookie flee into the woods as the cabin collapses from the force of the wind, killing their friends. In the woods at the edge of a precipice, the four survivors hear a growl approaching them. Cast Production =Filming= Screams of a Winter Night was shot on location in Natchitoches, Louisiana. Director James L. Wilson had been inspired to direct the film based on the success of several other local filmmakers, such as Charles B. Pierce and Joy Houck. The film's producer, Mark Lovell, was a real estate agent with no background in filmmaking. It was distributed by Dimension Pictures. The special effects in the film were supplied by William T. Cherry III, a local resident of Shreveport. =Excised scene= A fourth story included in the original cut of the film was excised for its theatrical release; this story featured two young men who are chased by a supernatural entity in a graveyard. Release The film premiered in several U.S. cities on July 13, 1979, including Atlanta, Seattle, and New Orleans. =Critical response= Writing in The Shreveport Times, Joe Leydon deemed the film \\"sluggish in spots,\\" concluding: \\"There is a great deal more atmosphere than sense to be found in Screams of a Winter Night.\\" He also compared elements of the film to the 1945 British anthology film Dead of Night. Richard Labont√© of the Ottawa Citizen was critical of the film, noting that \\"none of the stories is the least bit scary... It's enough to induce a good snooze.\\" Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times felt the film's direction was \\"stiff,\\" but overall deemed it \\"scary, with gruesome, bloody effects.\\" =Home media= The film was released on VHS in the 1980s, but has never received an official DVD release. The independent home media label Code Red released a Blu-ray edition of the film, the first 200 copies of which were made available for sale on February 8, 2019.

Among the people who visited Oconomowoc's for a little rest and relaxation were Chicago's most notorious gangsters, such as Baby Face Nelson, Bugs Moran, John Dillinger and Al Capone. Wisconsin's heavily wooded areas were perfect for laying low after a job. What Is Happening The main gangster activity in Waukesha County in the early 1900s usually involved alcohol of some sort: smuggling it in from Canada (usually on a seaplane that would land in one of Waukesha's many lakes), distilling liquor in a hidden still, or loading it on to trucks and shipping it around the country. During Prohibition this was all highly illegal. Despite all the illicit activity gangsters were often seen in a positive light. \\"A lot of (gangsters) had Robin Hood stories attached to them, like Pretty Boy Floyd and Bonnie and Clyde,\\" said Mr. Jeffrey Pickron, a University of Wisconsin- Oshkosh history professor. \\"And a lot of these gangsters stories would talk about how they stole from the rich and gave the money to the poor.\\" Gangsters had money, they lived exciting lives, and they lived by their own rules. It's not that surprising that public opinion of \\"criminals\\" was somewhat high. Gangsters were constantly doing things that made them endearing to others. \\"There are plenty of stories, for example, of gangsters pulling into a service station, buying $1 worth of gas and giving the attendant a $20 tip.\\" They had a freedom that normal people during the Great Depression just didn't have. Capone's Vacation Home Al Capone owned a vacation home right off on Bluemound Road in Brookfield, Wisconsin. He picked this spot because there were no police departments in the area, instead it was patrolled by county sheriff deputies, most of whom were paid off to turn a blind eye. The 37-acre lake on the property was used as a landing spot for seaplanes that were smuggling alcohol from Canada during Prohibition; it was then smuggled around the country. The land on which the house was built had a watch tower used as a lookout for unfriendlies, whether they were other gangsters or G-men, and Capone kept a flock of geese on the property to warn if something was approaching. There is a tunnel built into his home that runs from the house to the garage so that Capone could make a speedy getaway if need be. Zuta's Hit In 1930 one of Capone's bookkeepers, a man by the name of Jack Zuta, defected to George \\"Bugs\\" Moran's gang. Knowing that Capone did not like disloyalty, Zuta decided to lay low under the name \\"J.H. Goodman\\" at the Lake View Resort on Upper Lake Nemahbin in the town of Summit. Knowing it was only a matter of time before Capone's hit squad caught up with him, Zuta made a desperate call from an Oconomowoc drug store, begging for body guards to escort him down to Chicago. Unfortunately for him, he was overheard. Around sunset on August 1, 1930 Capone's hitsquad walked into the Lake View resort, threw open the back door, shot Zuta, and walked out the way they came in.

She was taken over by the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1914, renamed and rearmed. She served in World War I with the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Following the war, the ship was ceded to Italy and scrapped. Construction and design In 1912, China placed an order for a single destroyer with the Austrian shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste. The design of the destroyer, to be named Lung Tuan, was based on that of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's , which had entered service between 1905 and 1911. Like the Husz√°rs, Lung Tuan was to be powered by two triple expansion steam engines, fed by four Yarrow boilers, rated at , driving two shafts, although at , the ship was slightly faster than the Husz√°r class. The ship's hull was long at the waterline and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and deep load. The ship was to be armed with two 12-pounder and four 3-pounder guns, all supplied by Armstrong Whitworth of Great Britain and two torpedo tubes. Lung Tuan was laid down in 1912 and launched in 1913. Although the Husz√°r class and therefore Lung Tuan were obsolete by 1913, the Chinese government ordered a further 12 destroyers from STT that year, partly due to the low price (¬£16,500 per ship). Service Lung Tuan was virtually complete when Austria-Hungary declared war with Serbia on 28 July 1914, beginning the First World War. Lung Tuan was seized by Austria-Hungary on 1 August and towed to Pola where she was re-armed with Austrian weapons, receiving a gun outfit of two L/45 Skoda guns and four 6.6 cm L/30 guns, together with four 45 cm torpedo tubes. Renamed Warasdiner, the ship entered service with the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 10 September 1914. Warasdiner served for the remainder of the First World War. On 18‚Äì19 June 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Navy carried out a series of raids against towns on the Italian Adriatic coast, with Warasdiner shelling Monopoli, south-east of Bari on 19 June. On 5 December 1915 Warasdiner was returning from another raid on the coast of Italy when she sank the , which had run aground off Cattaro. On 2 August 1916 Warasdiner and sister ship were returning from bombarding the Italian city of Molfetta when they encountered the French destroyers and and the Italian destroyers Ardito and Impavido. The French and Italian destroyers set off in pursuit of the Austro-Hungarian ships, but broke off the chase as they neared the Austrian base of Cattaro (now Kotor), when the Austrian cruiser and two torpedo boats sortied in support of Warasdiner and Wildfang. She was ceded to Italy in 1920 and scrapped.

The event was staged throughout the city for several weeks in the mid to late summer. It was intended to attract tourists and to highlight San Diego's Spanish and Mexican heritage. History In 1955 the San Diego City Council approved a plan for a month-long celebration to take place in the summer of 1956. A private organization run by Wayne Dailard, who had served as manager of the 1936-37 California Pacific International Exposition, put on a 33-day-long event in 1956, with some financial support from the city and county. The fiesta was intended to be an annual event, but revenue projections fell short, and tourism industry representatives complained that it was drawing traffic away from the more established attractions. The festival continued for three more years but was shorter and less ambitious each year: July 18 to August 12 in 1956, July 24 to August 10 in 1957, August 29 to September 9 in 1958, and September 4 to 17 in 1959. After 1959 the fiesta was abandoned. Description The festival included weeks of varied activities throughout the city, including a beauty pageant, several parades, a series of road races, a rodeo, street parties, and multiple displays of dancing, art, and other cultural activities. The main event was an epic theatrical production entitled The California Story, which had originally been written for the California Centennial celebration in 1950 and had been presented in the Hollywood Bowl. The extravaganza was performed in Balboa Stadium on a stage as long as a city block. It featured 35 scenes and a cast of 1,300 people, including a symphony orchestra and a 150-voice choir. Lucille Norman was the star and lead singer in the 1957 production.\\"Fiesta Parade, Pageant Set Today,\\" (July 27, 1957), p. 1, The San Diego Union, San Diego, CA It was directed by Vladimir Rosing and conducted by Meredith Willson; both had filled the same role at the Hollywood Bowl.Official Program, Fiesta del Pacifico, San Diego, 1956 The production dramatized the history of California from the arrival of Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo in 1540 through the early 20th century. It was billed as \\"the biggest non-movie spectacle ever produced anywhere.\\" In 1959, the last year of the fiesta, the California Story production was replaced by a 2-hour show called Stars over Pacific. Legacy The celebration inspired the most popular and most-performed work by composer Roger Nixon: a piece for symphonic band called Fiesta del Pacifico. It was composed in 1958-59 and first performed in 1960. Nixon explained the name of his composition as follows: \\"Fiesta del Pacifico is held in San Diego and features a play on the history of the area, a parade, a rodeo, and street dances. It is one of several festivals held annually in various communities in California that celebrate the Old Spanish Days of the State, and I chose its name as representative of the spirit of those occasions.\\" References History of San Diego Festivals in San Diego Cultural festivals in the United States Latin American festivals ","title":"Fiesta del Pacifico"},{"id":"42982634","text":"Leptodiaptomus ashlandi is a calanoid copepod zooplankton native to the Laurentian Great Lakes and their basin.

The characters embody powerful forces or aspects of the DC Universe in the comic book series The Sandman, by Neil Gaiman. They have existed since the dawn of time and are thought to be among the most powerful beings in the existence. They are distinct from and more powerful than most gods. Dream is the protagonist of The Sandman series, but all of the Endless play major roles. The Endless are a somewhat dysfunctional family of seven siblings. They may appear in different forms, but usually have light skin and black hair, with the exception of redheads Destruction and Delirium. Their appearance can change to fit the expectations of others. When asked by Marco Polo if he is always so pale, DreamThe Sandman Vol.6: Fables & Reflections, p.145, Vertigo, replies, \\"That depends on who's watching.\\" Function and domains The Endless spend most of their time fulfilling their functions as embodiments of natural forces. For example, Death leads the souls of the dead away from the realm of the living, while Dream oversees the realm of dreams and imagination (\\"The Dreaming\\") and regulates dreams and inspiration. One notable facet of their depiction is that none of them are \\"representations\\" or \\"personifications\\" of their function, they simply are their function; as Sto-Oa says of Death in Endless Nights, \\"She is Death, just as he is Dream, and that one is Desire.\\" In The Sandman (vol. 2) #48, Destruction gives a further description of the Endless: > \\"The Endless are merely patterns. The Endless are ideas. The Endless are > wave functions. The Endless are repeating motifs. The Endless are echoes of > darkness, and nothing more... And even our existences are brief and bounded. > None of us will last longer than this version of the Universe.\\" Some of the Endless are more dedicated to their tasks than others. The younger Endless, especially Desire, are known to play games with mortal lives. Destruction, often called \\"The Prodigal\\", abandoned his duties altogether. If one of the Endless is destroyed, then he or she will be replaced by another aspect of their role, but this does not occur if they are simply absent or inactive. In such cases, the aspect of existence supervised by that member of the Endless becomes more random and chaotic. During this time the Universe may attempt to replace that member by putting some of their essence within a mortal, as it did with Wesley Dodds, who received a fraction of Dream's soul while Dream was imprisoned. All of the Endless have a realm in which they are absolutely sovereign. Within their realm, all members of the Endless have a gallery containing symbols, or sigils, of the other Endless. The Endless may contact each other by holding the appropriate sigil and calling for that member of the Endless. Destiny is also able to summon his siblings by using his gallery of portraits, whether they want it or not (as seen in The Sandman: Overture). In addition to overseeing their own sphere of influence, the Endless also help to define their own opposites. This dualistic aspect of the Endless has been confirmed in the case of Death, who is present at the beginning as well as the end of every life. Destruction has an interest in creative pastimes, including art, poetry and cooking. Dream seems to have some power to shape reality, as seen in The Sandman (vol. 2) #18, A Dream of a Thousand Cats, in which a large number of entities, dreaming of an alternate reality, create said reality. Also, Delirium has some kind of strange logic that only makes sense to her, but that allows her to understand things that others do not. In The Sandman Overture, it was revealed that under some conditions, some Endless can fool other Endless by trickery and use some of their powers (either directly or due to some specific kind of logic). Indeed, Dream was capable of saving the dead Prez from Boss Smiley, while Death could not do it herself (this is because Dream is also The Prince of Stories ‚Äì which allows him some control over the afterlife). Desire was capable of posing as an aspect of Dream (The Dream of Cats) and create a dream Vessel that was supposedly created by Dream. It was convincing enough to fool both Destiny and Dream (but not Delirium). The exact limits of the powers the Endless may/must use are subject to debate, but are set by rules (such as Dream being forbidden to kill dreamers, unless they become a vortex, in which case killing becomes an obligation). It is unknown if the Endless are allowed/capable/supposed to use their powers on those more powerful or more ancient than them; when at one point Dream heads into Hell in an effort to rescue a former lover of his, he admits that his power will allow him entrance, but that he does not know if he would be able to defeat Lucifer, who is a former archangel created by The Presence (the DC comics analogue of God). Origin The origin and exact nature of the Endless is unknown. Few hints are ever given in the series as to exactly why the Endless exist. They seem to be natural forces. They have at times been described as \\"a creation of the consciousness of living beings\\". The Endless are as old as the concepts that they represent. The Endless are said to be older than the fairyfolk, gods, and other supernatural beings. Their exact ages in years are unknown, but they are known to have existed long before life on Earth; in Brief Lives, Destruction says that he has performed his duties‚Äînot counting the previous three centuries‚Äîfor 10 billion years. In The Sandman (vol. 2) #5, \\"Passengers\\", Dream is recognized by the Martian Manhunter as the dream god on ancient Mars, as well as in the Endless Nights chapter \\"Dream: The Heart of the Star\\", which takes place before our Sun's planets have \\"awakened\\" with life. Dream states in The Sandman (vol. 2) #16 that once another world was lost to a vortex. Death has claimed that she was there when the first living thing stirred, and Destiny has said that Dream gave the Earth itself the fond dream of being able to support life. Dream, according to Abel, was created shortly after Death, as living things are born before they can dream. One of the few references to any sort of parentage for the Endless is in The Sandman (vol. 2) #70, where some sentience in the Necropolis Litharge that guards the symbols of each of the Endless wails \\"like a mother sorrowing for her departed child.\\" In The Sandman: Overture #5, it is revealed that the father of the Endless is Time and their mother is Night. Night is accompanied by Dusk, who was described by illustrator J. H. Williams III as a \\"distant sister\\" to Dream. The Sandman: Overture also reveals that Time and Night are not on friendly speaking terms. The Endless The Endless are not known to have proper names, although Dream has a habit of collecting different names for himself. They are each known by their respective function. *': The oldest of the Endless, Destiny appears as a blind man dressed in grey or brown robes (purple in earlier comics), carrying a large book, the Cosmic Log. The book is chained to him, or he is chained to the book, and within the book is written the entire sum of existence, past, present and future. Destiny seems the most possessed by his function and responsibilities of any of the Endless. He rarely demonstrates much personality. His sigil is his book. His speech appears as a regular word balloon with letters in italics. In his garden are paths souls walk along as they fulfill their lives. Destiny is the only sibling who did not originate in The Sandman; he was created by Marv Wolfman and Bernie Wrightson for Weird Mystery Tales in 1972. *Death: Death appears as a level-headed young Goth woman. She wears a silver ankh (representing the afterlife), which serves as her sigil. She has a marking similar to an Eye of Horus around her right eye. She prefers to dress and act casually, and is on better terms with Dream than any of the other Endless. Her speech is presented in regular letters in a regular balloon. She spends one day out of every century as a mortal, living and dying on Earth. She is by far the most pleasant of The Endless, being kind and personable to almost everyone; encountering her upon dying feels like \\"meeting an old friend\\". However, she is also capable of intimidation: in \\"Season of Mists\\", she browbeat Desire into silence; and in \\"The Kindly Ones\\", she ordered The Furies to be silent so that she and Dream could speak. *Dream: Dream (Morpheus): Portrayed as both lord and personification of all dreams and fictional stories. His face and physique is based on the amalgamation of Neil Gaiman in his twenties, The Cure's frontman Robert Smith, ballet dancer Farukh Ruzimatov and Bauhaus frontman Peter Murphy. Journalists have listed Dream among the best comic book characters. Dream's usual appearance is as a tall, pale man with wild dark blue-black hair. He dresses in a shapeless cloak of \\"night\\" with \\"flames dancing in its folds\\". His eyes are pools of shadows with glimmers of light within. He is known by many names, most commonly \\"Morpheus\\". He has a long history of insensitivity towards others, and throughout The Sandman, he must come to deal with his past cruelties. He is very concerned with fulfilling his responsibilities. His sigil is his dream-helm, made from the spine and skull of a long-dead god. His word balloons have wavy edges and a black background outlined in white, with white lettering. Dream (): Morpheus' successor appears as a tall, pale young man with white hair and a white costume. Like Morpheus, his eyes are formed by shadows with a glimmer of light in their center. Before becoming the new Dream at the end of The Sandman, he was a young boy named Daniel, which he later retains as a name. Daniel was gestated in dreams for two years, the child of Lyta Trevor-Hall and the ghost of Hector Hall. He is generally softer in his approach than Morpheus. Daniel carries an emerald eagle stone, although his sigil remains the same (that of the dream-helm). His word balloons are similar to Morpheus', only with a white background and black lettering. *': A very large, robust man with red hair, who sometimes appears bearded and sometimes shaven. Destruction abandoned his responsibilities as one of the Endless three hundred years ago, causing much conflict between him and his siblings. Since abandoning his realm, the other Endless usually refer to him as \\"the Prodigal\\" or \\"Brother\\" rather than \\"Destruction\\". He has a passion for creative and constructive endeavors, but little talent. His sigil is a sword. His text is normal, but is in a balloon with a bold outline. *': Desire is androgynous, capable of appearing as a man, a woman, neither, or possibly both (in the epilogue of The Sandman: Overture, Despair refers to Desire as \\"sister-brother\\"; in Season of Mists, Dream refers to Desire as ‚Äúsibling‚Äù). Desire has a cruel streak and a long-standing rivalry with Dream. Its sigil is a silver-tinted glass heart shape and it lives in a huge flesh and blood statue of itself called the Threshold. Although Desire is Despair's twin, in a sense it is older than Despair. The current incarnation of Desire is the original one, while Despair is currently in her second incarnation. Desire's text is defined by a specific letter style in a normal balloon. *': Twin sister to Desire: The First Despair: In her first form, Despair had many of the same physical qualities as her later form, but taller and tattooed with intricate red lines. She was also much more talkative and self-assured than her later incarnation. She is occasionally mentioned in passing, and is later depicted in The Sandman: Endless Nights. It is hinted that she may have been responsible for the destruction of the planet Krypton as a means to create the ultimate despair. It has been suggested that she was actually murdered, and that the one responsible will suffer until the end of existence.Sandman: The Wake The Second Despair: A short, obese woman with greyish skin and irregularly-shaped teeth. She is always naked. Despair has a cold, quietly intelligent manner. She has a habit of carving her flesh with a hooked ring that she wears, which is also her sigil. The second aspect is the one that appears throughout the main storyline. Despair's text is normal in a balloon with ragged-waved edges. She often associates with Desire, but unlike Desire she was fond of Destruction. *': The youngest of the Endless, Delirium appears as a young girl whose form changes the most frequently of any of the Endless, based on the random fluctuations of her temperament. She has wild multicolored hair and eccentric, mismatched clothes. Her only permanent physical characteristic is that one of her eyes is emerald green (usually the right side) and the other pale blue with silver flecks (usually the left side), but even those sometimes switch between left and right. Her sigil is an abstract, shapeless blob of colors. Her speech is portrayed in standard graphic novel block-caps, characterized by wavy, unpredictable orientation and a multi-colored gradient background. She was once known as Delight', but some traumatic event (of which even Destiny does not know the particulars) caused her to change into her current role. Her sigil as Delight was a flower. False Endless Several entities have falsely claimed to be members of the Endless. \\"Dread of the Endless\\" attempted to conquer the Dreaming in the comic of the same name. She presented herself as Dream's sister. In a Lucifer storyline, Titans Gyges and Garamas identified themselves as Duplicity and Deceit in an attempt to gain control of the Heart of the Dreaming, with Lucien dryly noting that the two concepts are identical.

Cordgrass normally anchors sediment in salt marshes; its loss leads to decreased substrate hardness, increased erosion, and collapse of creek banks into the water, ultimately resulting in decreased marsh health and productivity. Die-off can affect several species of cordgrass (genus Spartina), including S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, and S. townsendii. There are several competing hypotheses predicting the causes and mechanisms of salt marsh die-off throughout the western Atlantic. These hypotheses place different emphasis on the effects of top-down or bottom-up processes for salt marsh die-off. Combined with salt marsh dieback of the high marsh, salt marsh die-off is a serious threat to the ecosystem services that marshes provide to local coastal communities. History of top-down vs. bottom-up In light of their effect on community processes, behaviors, and ecological interactions, consumptive interactions are some of the most widely studied concepts in ecology. Because of this, scientists use food webs to depict all of the food chains and trophic relationships in an ecological community. Example of a food web Food webs can be controlled by bottom-up or top-down forces, which dictate whether a food web's structure and population dynamics are regulated by nutrients (a supply of fixed carbon) and primary production or by top predators, respectively. Much energy is lost from one trophic level to the next (about 90%); therefore, the success of higher levels is linked to lower ones and their supply of resources (Lindeman 1942).Lindeman, R.L. 1942. The trophic dynamic aspect of ecology. Ecology 23: 399-418. However, the abundance and distribution of organisms in an ecosystem is also affected by densities of consumers, which limit the success of organisms at lower trophic levels and thereby influence the abundance of these organisms (Hairston et al. 1960).Hairston, N.G., E.D. Frederick, and B.S. Lawrence. 1960. Community structure, population control, and competition. The American Naturalist, 94(879): 421-425. Many ecologists argue that bottom-up and top-down control do not play equally critical roles in the structure and dynamics of populations in an ecosystem; however, data suggests that both bottom-up and top-down forces impact the structure of food webs and the spatial and temporal abundance and distribution of organisms (Bertness 2007),Bertness, M.D. 2007. Atlantic Shorelines: Natural History and Ecology. Princeton, Jew Jersey: Princeton University Press. although to what extent each plays a role is not fully understood. Historically, an emphasis on bottom-up control in many ecosystems has prevailed in ecological thought, often to the exclusion of consumer control (Strong 1992).Strong D.R. 1992. Are trophic cascades all wet- differentiation and donor control in speciose ecosystems. Ecology 73(3): 747-754. Many ecosystems in which consumer control has classically been considered trivial are dominated by plants (e.g., forests, grasslands, and salt marshes) and are usually green in appearance. Hairston and colleagues proposed an opposing view in 1960 that emphasized consumer control. They argued that the ‚Äúworld is green‚Äù because higher trophic levels regulate herbivore abundance (Hairston et al. 1960). Critics pointed out that the world is not always green, and that when it is, herbivores do not necessarily play an important role in structuring plant communities (Ehrlich and Birch 1967).Ehrlich, P.R. and L.C. Birch. 1967. The ‚Äúbalance of nature‚Äù and ‚Äúpopulation control.‚Äù The American Naturalist, 101: 97-107. Others argued that what is green is not always edible or of sufficiently high quality to allow increases in herbivore populations (Dixon 1966, Murdoch 1966).Dixon, A.F.F. 1966. The effect of population density and nutritive status of the host on the summer reproductive activity of the sycamore aphid, Drepanosiphum platanoides. J. Anim. Ecol. 35 105-112.Murdoch, W.W. 1966. Community structure, population control, and competition: a critique. The American Naturalist, 100: 219-226. The debate is ongoing, but the dominant view of ecologists remains that although consumers affect many aspects of plant productivity and ecology, top- down control does not drive the productivity of entire plant ecosystems. More recently, however, examples of conspicuous consumer control of entire ecosystems have emerged in a variety of habitats including lakes (Carpenter et al. 1985),Carpenter, S. R., J. F. Kitchell, and J. R. Hodgson. Cascading trophic interactions and lake productivity. BioScience 35, 634-639 (1985). rivers (Power 1992),Power, M.E. 1992. Habitat heterogeneity and the functional significance of fish in river food webs. Ecology, 73: 1675-1688. and marine (Estes and Duggins 1995)Estes, J. A. and D.O. Duggins. 1995. Sea otters and kelp forests in Alaska: Generality and variation in a community ecological paradigm. Ecological Monographs 65, 75-100. habitats. Foundation plant species can be replaced with other species or substratum completely lacking vegetation and insects can defoliate whole mangroves (Feller 2002).Feller, I. C. 2002. The role of herbivory by wood-boring insects in mangrove ecosystems in Belize. Oikos 97, 167-176. A classic example of top-down interactions dictating community structure and function comes from Bob Paine's work in Washington, which established that removal of the starfish Pisaster triggered a trophic cascade in which the blue mussel (Mytilus) populations exploded due to release from predation pressure (Paine 1966)Paine, R.T. 1966. Web complexity and species diversity. The American Naturalist, 100(910): 65-75. Another influential example of top-down control emerged from Jane Lubchenco's experiments on New England rocky shores, which demonstrated that the herbivorous snail L. littorea exerts control on the diversity and succession of tide pool algal communities (Lubchenco and Menge 1978).Lubchenco, J. and B.A. Menge. 1978. Community development and persistence in a low rocky intertidal zone. Ecological Monographs 48: 67-94. One hypothesis that arose from Lubchenco's work (Little and Kitching 1996)Little, C. and J.A. Kitching. 1996. The Biology of Rocky Shores. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. was that predation by the green crab (Carcinus maenas) influences rocky shore algal communities by regulating L. littorea abundances. Ecologists cite these examples as evidence that consumer regulation is more potent and predominant than previously recognized. Historical paradigms of salt marsh theory Healthy salt marsh In salt marshes, early ecologists like Eugene Odum and John Teal sparked the current bottom-up paradigm in ecology through work on Sapelo Island, GA (U.S.A) that stressed the dominant role of physical factors like temperature, salinity, and nutrients in regulating plant primary productivity and ecosystem structure (Teal 1962, Odum 1971).Teal, J.M. 1962. Energy flow in the salt marsh ecosystem of Georgia. Ecology 43: 614‚Äì624.Odum, E.P. 1971. Fundamentals of Ecology. Philadelphia: Saunders. Ecologists noted that marsh plants were not heavily grazed and appeared to be relatively unpalatable, and thus argued that most plants entered salt marsh food chains as detritus (Teal 1962). A corollary of this dogma is that consumers play an unimportant or subtle role in controlling salt marsh primary production (Smalley 1960, Teal 1962).Smalley A.E. 1960. Energy flow of a salt marsh grasshopper population. Ecology 41:672‚Äì77. This paradigm was widely accepted for decades and applied to other ecosystems like mangroves and seagrass beds (Bertness 2007), and has thus ‚Äúbecome entrenched in the conceptual understanding of coastal ecosystems‚Äù (quote from Bertness and Silliman 2008; Smalley 1960, Nixon 1982).Bertness, M.D. and B.R.

Washington, DC: U.S. Dep. Int. Fish Wildl. Serv. FWS/OBS-81/55. 70 pp. Recent work, however, has demonstrated strong top-down control of plant communities in salt marshes by a wide variety of consumers, including snails, crabs, and geese (Jefferies 1997, Bortolus and Iribarne 1999, Silliman and Bertness 2002, Holdredge et al. 2009).Jefferies, R.L. 1997.

Selective herbivory and plant community structure in a mid-Atlantic salt marsh. Ecology 75: 1015-1022. cattle, hares, insects, and rodents, some of which are able to strongly suppress plant growth. Strong top-down control on marshes has been demonstrated in various marsh systems. Consumer control is driven by the grapsid crab (Chasmagnathus granulata) in the salt marshes of Argentina and Brazil on the Atlantic coast of South America (Bortolus and Iribarne 1999). Other experiments in Argentina have contributed to the growing body of work evidencing consumer control in salt marshes (Alberti et al. 2007),Alberti J, M. Escapa, P. Daleo, O. Iribarne, B.R. Silliman, M.D. Bertness. 2007. Local and geographic variation in grazing intensity by herbivorous crabs in SW Atlantic salt marshes. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 349: 235‚Äì43. and herbivory has also been suggested to play an important role in southwestern Atlantic marshes (Bortolus and Iribarne 1999, Alberti et al. 2007). Not only are consumers important on a small scale as demonstrated by cage experiments in various locations (Silliman and Zieman 2001, Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman et al. 2005),Silliman B.R., Zieman JC. 2001. Top-down control of Spartina alterniflora production by periwinkle grazing in a Virginia salt marsh. Ecology 82:2830‚Äì45.Silliman B.R., van de Koppel J, Bertness MD, Stanton LE, Mendelssohn IA. 2005. Drought, snails, and largescale die-off of southern U.S. salt marshes. Science 310:1803‚Äì6. but they also affect primary productivity across large geographic areas (Silliman and Zieman 2001). Bertness and Silliman have also suggested that while salt marshes may have historically been nutrient limited and bottom up controlled, human disturbances such as eutrophication and predator depletion has shifted these systems to top down control in recent decades (Bertness and Silliman 2008). Regional causes of salt marsh die-off Calving creek bank of a marsh experiencing die-off in Cape Cod, Massachusetts Both top-down and bottom-up forces have been proposed as primary drivers of salt marsh die-off throughout the western Atlantic. The relative importance of these factors depends on the abiotic and biotic conditions of each local or regional marsh system and its environment. =Top- down interactions= Human activities can trigger trophic cascades (Jefferies 1997), which occur when the predators that limit abundance of prey and thereby enhance survival of the next lower trophic level are depleted (Strong 1992). Depletion of top predators releases their prey from consumer control and leads to population declines of the next lower trophic level, often the primary producers. Trophic cascades occur across a minimum of three trophic levels and can impact community dynamics in a variety of systems (Estes et al. 1998).Estes, J.A., M.T. Tinker, T.M. Williams, and D.F. Doak. 1998. Killer whale predation on sea otters linking oceanic and nearshore ecosystems. Science 282: 473‚Äì476. Trophic cascades can induce salt marsh die-off and transform green landscapes into barrens (Estes and Duggins 1995, Silliman et al. 2005). Primary triggers of trophic cascades through human action include introduction of invasive species, overexploitation, and climate change (Jackson et al. 2001, Lotze et al. 2006, Gedan et al. 2009, Gedan and Bertness 2011).Jackson, J.B.C., et al. 2001. Historical overfishing and the recent collapse of coastal ecosystems. Science 293: 629‚Äì638.Lotze, H.K., Lenihan H.S., Bourque B.J., Bradbury R.H. and others. 2006. Depletion, degradation, and recovery potential of estuaries and coastal seas. Science 312: 1806-1809. Invasive Species Myocastor coypus Human introduction of non-native species can also contribute to top-down control of marsh systems (Furbish and Albano 1994, Gough and Grace 1998).Gough L. and J.B. Grace. 1998. Effects of flooding, salinity and herbivory on coastal plant communities, Louisiana, United States. Oecologia 117:527‚Äì35. Introduced feral horses on the barrier islands of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas have entirely denuded marsh ecosystems (Furbish and Albano 1994), and the introduced rodent nutria on Gulf Coast marshes of Louisiana can decrease marsh plant primary production (Gough and Grace 1998). The invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas, can turn off top down control by facilitating the recovery of salt marsh ecosystems. In marshes that have experienced die-off via the trophic cascade initiated by recreational overfishing, purple marsh crabs, Sesarma reticulatum, can be evicted by the larger green crabs, which prey upon the purple crab. In this way, green crabs can indirectly reduce purple crab herbivory and promotes cordgrass recovery. These results are encouraging because they suggest that invasive species, which are classically considered to have mostly negative impacts on the ecosystems they invade, can sometimes actually contribute to restoring degraded ecosystems. Bertness, M. D. and T. C. Coverdale. 2013. An invasive species facilitates the recovery of salt marsh ecosystems on Cape Cod. Ecology 94:1937‚Äì1943. Fungal Die-off could potentially be explained by pathogens of salt marsh plants in some areas - fungal species have been identified at die-off sites in the UK as well as US Atlantic and Gulf coast sites (Elmer 2013).Elmer, W.H. et al. 2013. Sudden Vegetation Dieback in Atlantic and Gulf Coast Salt Marshes. Plant Disease, 436-445. Fungal-facilitated marsh degradation is a documented concern in the Southeast Atlantic in particular. Marsh snails Littoraria irrorata make minor cuts in the cordgrass during grazing. These cuts facilitate growth of fungus, and at high snail densities, can lead to mass infections, increased grazing and consequent die-off (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005).Silliman B.R., Newell SY. 2003. Fungal-farming in a snail. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 100:15643‚Äì48. In coastal New England, this evidence is weaker. Certain fungal pathogens of S. alterniflora were found more frequently in sites of die-off. These pathogens have varying degrees of virulence, and there is some evidence of association with species of Fusarium and areas of die-off. However, although the association suggests a partial causal link, particularly in stress-predisposed plants, strong evidence is lacking to suggest that such fungal pathogens are a major cause of die-off in New England (Elmer 2013). Overexploitation Overharvesting has led to the collapse of various shallow-water marine ecosystems around the globe (Jackson et al. 2001), including coral reefs (Hughes et al. 2003),Hughes, T. P., et al. 2003. Climate change, human impacts, and the resilience of coral reefs. Science 301:929‚Äì933. sea grass beds, and kelp forests (Estes et al. 1998). =Commercial fishing= Marsh snail (L. irrorata) eats fungus on cordgrass, killing the plants Research on the salt marsh snail Littoraria irrorata and its effects on marsh plant productivity, have provided strong evidence of consumer control in marshes triggered by overexploitation. This snail is capable of turning strands of cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) (>2.5m tall) into mudflats within 8 months, which is less than one growing season (Silliman and Bertness 2002). As previously referenced, marsh snails inflict cuts on cordgrass leaves when they graze, providing substratum and nutrients for fungus. At high snail densities, cordgrass can succumb to fungal infections and marsh die-off can ensue (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005). Natural predators of the marsh snail are blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and terrapin turtles (Malaclemys terrapin), which historically regulated snail abundances. However, these predators have been commercially overexploited, and now suffer from diseases due to small population size, releasing the snails from consumer pressure, and allowing the snails to wreak havoc on salt marsh cordgrass populations (Silliman and Zieman 2001). Sea otter A classic example of a trophic cascade was caused by the overexploitation of sea otters in the 1980s (Estes & Duggins 1995). Sea otters eat urchins, which in turn graze on macroalgae in a food chain that, when altered, can lead to urchin barrens. Sea otters in Alaska were hunted to near extinction for their pelts. Where sea otter populations have persisted, they suppress the abundance of urchins and thus have an indirect positive effect on the density of macroalgae. In contrast, in sites where sea otters are absent, sea urchin populations have surged and caused urchin barrens to develop. Wherever sea otters have been reinstated, sea urchin populations have been reduced, and kelp densities have increased, returning the habitat to its original healthy state. This example demonstrates the potential for whole-ecosystem recovery with the reestablishment of consumers (Estes and Duggins 1995). Other trophic cascades, such as those caused by crabs such as Chasmagnathus granulata in South America, are at least in part due to overfishing of top predators (Bortolus and Iribarne 1999, Alberti et al. 2007). =Recreational fishing= The purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum In New England, predator depletion has triggered extensive marsh die-off salt marsh creek banks. Herbivory has already impacted up to 90% of creek banks in more than 70% of outer Cape Cod marshes. Absent in 1997, die-off has recently spread into Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, impacting over 85% of creek banks. The nocturnal purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum, is playing a major role in this die-off through increased burrowing and herbivory due to release from predation pressure. Evidence has pointed to top- down control caused by human disturbances as the primary agent driving die- off. Altieri and colleagues performed a series of experiments (Altieri et al. 2012)Altieri, A.H., M.D. Bertness, T.C. Coverdale, N.C. Herrmann, C. Angelini. 2012. A trophic cascade triggers collapse of a salt-marsh ecosystem with intensive recreational fishing. Ecology 93(6): 1402-1410. designed to elucidate the mechanisms driving marsh die-off more specifically. Sesarma crabs are normally preyed upon by blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), and fish including striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis). Although the cascading effects of overfishing have been demonstrated across various ecosystems (Myers and Worm 2003), research on predator depletion has focused almost exclusively on the impact of large-scale commercial overfishing (Worm et al. 2009). However, Altieri and colleagues (2012) demonstrated that the predators of Sesarma were, and continue to be, overexploited by recreational anglers. Their results show that die-off and vegetated marshes differed dramatically in recreational fishing pressure, as anglers were observed only at die-off sites. Die-off marshes had half the biomass of top- level predators found at vegetated sites, while the biomass of nonharvested consumers did not differ between die-off and vegetated sites. Additionally, the predation rate on Sesarma at vegetated sites was triple that of die-off sites, and crabs consumed four times more grass at die-off sites than at vegetated sites. Historical reconstructions showed that little net marsh loss (<5%) from 1939-2005 occurred at currently vegetated sites. In contrast, die- off marshes exhibited the onset of die-off in the mid-70s, with consistently increasing vegetation loss through 2005, at which time >20% of the total marsh area was lost to die-off and >80% of the cordgrass zone was unvegetated. This divergence between die-off and vegetated marshes in vegetation loss coincides with a period of rapid increase in the number of docks and boat slips before the mid-70s that resulted in the establishment of >70% of that fishing infrastructure currently present at die-off marshes. These results provide evidence that Sesarma release from predation pressure by crabs and fish due to recreational overfishing by anglers is driving a trophic cascade that is responsible for extensive marsh die-off throughout southern New England (Altieri et al. 2012). Denuded, eroding salt marsh creek bankAltieri and colleagues (2012) further hypothesized that historic, large-scale, industrialized overexploitation of fish in the northwest Atlantic (Lotze et al. 2006) increased marsh vulnerability to the effects of localized recreational fishing to the point that large-scale die off ensued, and that resultant localized die-offs could coalesce into complete, region-wide marsh die-off if overexploitation of top consumers continues (Altieri et al. 2012). Most recently, Bertness and colleagues (Bertness et al. 2014b)Bertness, M.D., C. P. Brisson* T. C. Coverdale, M. C. Bevil, S. M. Crotty and E. R. Suglia. 2014 Experimental predator removal causes rapid salt marsh die-off. Ecology Letters 17(7):830‚Äì835. . performed a field experiment excluding predators from plots on the grazing border of the marsh. Within one growing season, exclusion of top predators triggered die-off by increasing the abundances of Sesarma crabs and the intensity of herbivory. To further test the trophic cascade hypothesis, Bertness and colleagues used the spread of die-off into Narragansett Bay to assess all proposed drivers of die-off, including: 1) eutrophication decreases plant investment into belowground biomass causing plant collapse, 2) boat wakes erode creek banks, 3) pollution or disease affect plant health, 4) substrate hardness controls herbivorous crab distributions and 5) trophic dysfunction releases Sesarma from predator control. Nitrogen availability, wave intensity and plant growth did not explain any variation in die-off. However, herbivory explained over 70% of inter-site variation in die-off. (Bertness et al. 2014a)Bertness, M. D., C. Brisson, M. Bevil, and S. Crotty. 2014. Herbivory drives the spread of salt marsh die-off. PLoS ONE 9(3): e92916. This work highlighted one particular example where top-down interactions were experimentally shown to be the primary driver of ecological community state change. =Bottom-up interactions= Hypersaline and anoxic soils One theory of bottom-up control lies with differential soil chemistry between vegetated and die-off areas. Drought-associated changes in soil chemistry have been proposed to be associated with areas of die-off. Droughts are often associated with increased salinity and acidity stress - soils oxidize under freshwater or tidal moisture limitation, leading to increased acidity. Hypersalinity has been linked to reduced S. alterniflora survival (Brown et al. 2005).Brown, C.E., S.R. Pezeshki, R.D. DeLaune. The effects of salinity and soil drying on nutrient uptake and growth of S. alterniflora in a simulated tidal system. Environmental and Experimental Botany 58(1-3): 140-148. However, salt marsh plants are generally tolerant of a broad range of salinity levels, and increased salinity has not consistently been observed in die-off sites (Alber et al. 2008).Alber M., E. Swenson, S. Adamowicz, I. Mendelssohn 2008. Salt marsh dieback: an overview of recent events in the US. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 8(1):1-11. There is uncertainty attributed to the link between different soil conditions and sites of die-off for several reasons. First, measurements may not be taken in frequent enough intervals to capture brief fluctuations in soil conditions associated with die-off. Second, attributing causation with changing soil conditions and die-off is potentially dubious. Reverse causality is a potential explanation; that is, soil chemistry differences may be a result rather than an agent of die-off. For instance, one study noted higher salinity levels in die-off areas in some months, but this was possibly attributable to altered root or evaporation dynamics due to die- off (Marsh 2007). Eutrophication Nutrient enrichment is a pervasive global threat to both marine and terrestrial ecosystems (Galloway et al. 2008, Verhoeven et al. 2006).Galloway, J. et al. Transformation of the nitrogen cycle: recent trends, questions and potential solutions. Science 320, 889‚Äì892 (2008).Verhoeven, J. T. et al. Regional and global concerns over wetlands and water quality. Trends Ecol. Evol. 21, 96‚Äì103 (2006) In marine ecosystems, increased flow of nitrogen can trigger severe algal blooms, anoxic conditions, and widespread fisheries losses (Diaz & Rosenberg 2008).Diaz, R. J. and R. Rosenberg. Spreading dead zones and consequences for marine ecosystems. Science 321, 926‚Äì929 (2008). In salt marshes, an important interface ecosystem between land and sea, nutrient addition has been hypothesized to contribute to widespread creek die-offs (Deegan et al. 2012).Deegan, L.A., Bowen, J.L., Drake, D., Fleeger, J.W., Friedrichs, C.T., Hobbie, J.E., Hopkinson, C., Johnson, D.S., Johnson, J.M., LeMay, L.E., Miller, E., Peterson, B.J., Picard, C., Sheldon, S., Sutherland, M., Vallino, J. and S. Warren. 2012. Coastal eutrophication as a driver of salt marsh loss. Nature 490:388-392. To test this hypothesis, Linda Deegan and colleagues performed a nine-year study at one site in Massachusetts. The researchers found that tidal creek enrichment of nitrogen and phosphorus led to decreased investment in belowground nutrient gathering roots and rhizomes, increased microbial decomposition of organic matter, and eventual creek collapse and salt marsh loss (Deegan et al. 2012). Similar studies in Connecticut, however, have been unable to replicate these findings. Shimon Anisfeld and Troy Hill performed a 5-year fertilization experiment of a salt marsh in Long Island Sound and found that neither nitrogen nor phosphorus fertilization led to elevation loss, reduced soil carbon, or a decrease in belowground primary production. They suggest that high nutrient levels can significantly alter marsh processes and increase gross carbon loss from sediment but that other processes may compensate for these impacts. No net deleterious effects of nutrient loading on carbon storage or on marsh stability are anticipated from this study (Anisfeld and Hill 2012).Anisfeld, S. and T. Hill. 2012. Fertilization effects on elevation change and belowground carbon balance in a Long Island Sound tidal marsh. Estuaries and Coasts 35: 201‚Äì211. Other eutrophication studies performed in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island found that experimental nitrogen addition initially increases plant productivity but eventually leads to reduced plant biomass due to insect herbivory (Bertness et al. 2008). To supplement this experiment, researchers took surveys across 20 salt marshes to look at the interaction between marsh nutrient levels and herbivore pressure and found that marsh nitrogen supply was a good predictor of herbivore damage to plants. This study suggests that eutrophication is currently triggering consumer suppression of primary productivity in New England salt marshes and may eventually pose a threat to salt marsh ecosystem service provisioning (Bertness et al. 2008). Potential for Synergistic effects Coastal ecosystems suffer from a variety of anthropogenic impacts, such as large-scale eutrophication, food web alteration, runaway consumer effects, climate change, habitat destruction, and disease. Rarely do these factors act in isolated ways. Often, researchers find additive or synergistic interactions between impacts compounding the amount of ecosystem degradation. One such example is found in salt marshes in the southeastern United States. Depletion of top predators in these systems has led to snail overgrazing of salt marsh cordgrass and subsequent die-off (as explained above). However, this die-off has been linked with intense drought conditions and the resultant increases in salt and acid stress (Silliman et al. 2005). Drought stress that raises soil salinities and increases cordgrass vulnerabilities to top-down control may be a product of climate change (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman et al. 2005). Cases such as these highlight how abiotic and biotic interactions can interact to affect ecosystem health. Anthropogenic actions also can cause eutrophication, or increase the nutrient load, of marine ecosystems, through runoff into the system containing fertilizer, sewage, dishwasher soap, and other nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich substances. Eutrophication is pervasive in coastal marine ecosystems (Lotze et al. 2006) and can indirectly initiate trophic cascades and increase consumer control of plants. For example, insect herbivory in marshes has been positively correlated with nutrient availability in Atlantic salt marshes (Bertness et al. 2008).Bertness, M.D., C.M. Crain, C. Holdredge and N. Sala. 2008. Eutrophication and consumer control of New England salt marsh primary production. Conservation Biology 22: 131-139. In Narragansett Bay, insect herbivory suppresses primary production of human disturbed salt marshes by almost 40%. Nitrogen additions through human activity can increase insect herbivory so much that primary production is suppressed by nearly 60%, while marshes without human shoreline development remain solely under bottom-up control (Bertness et al. 2008). Increased nutrient supply can lead to runaway herbivory in other systems as well (Gough and Grace 1998, Silliman and Zieman 2001). For example, eutrophication initiates top-down control via the impact of snow geese on the arctic marshes of Hudson Bay (Jefferies 1997). By the 1980s, the snow geese that originally annually migrated to Hudson Bay had switched from feeding in temperate wetlands to feeding in heavily fertilized agricultural fields. Over a period of 30 years, the geese population exploded. Snow geese have since utterly destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres of the Hudson Bay wetland. The geese grubbed marsh plant roots, evaporation increased leading to subsequent salinity increase, and without plants to oxygenate the soil the substrate became anoxic. This undesirable environment for marsh plants disallows sexual recruitment to the area. Snow geese have denuded the marsh until recolonization by clonal runners can restore marsh vegetation, which could take years. Because of the use of artificial fertilizers on temperate zone agricultural fields, a trophic cascade was initiated (Jefferies 1997). A major goal of ecology over the next century will be to understand how ecosystems will respond to current and future human impacts and the additive or synergistic interactions between them. Management implications and conservation Cordgrass binds sediment, attenuates waves and prevents shoreline erosion Ecosystem services are the benefits that humans derive from ecological systems. Today, one of the arguments for protecting salt marshes is to increase the quality and quantity of these services. Salt marshes sequester nitrogen, filtering runoff water and reducing nitrogen input to estuaries (Valiela and Cole 2002).Valiela I. and M.L. Cole. 2002. Comparative evidence that salt marshes and mangroves may protect seagrass meadows from land-derived nitrogen loads. Ecosystems 5: 92‚Äì102. Salt marshes also provide essential refuge habitat for young fish and crustaceans, provisioning coastal fisheries (Boesch and Turner 1984)Boesch D.F. and R.E. Turner. 1984. Dependence of fishery species on salt marshes: the role of food and refuge. Estuaries 7: 460‚Äì468. that account for 90% of the world's fish catch (UNEP 2006).UNEP. 2006. Marine and coastal ecosystems and human well-being: a synthesis report based on the findings of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. UNEP. Salt marshes also sequester carbon, which will be an important ecosystem service as climate change intensifies (Chmura et al. 2003).Chmura G.L., S.C. Anisfeld, D.R. Cahoon, and J.C. Lynch. 2003. Global carbon sequestration in tidal, saline wetland soils. Global Biogeochemical Cycles 17: 1111‚Äì1133. Arguably the most important ecosystem service salt marshes provide is to act as natural sea barriers because grasses bind soils, prevent shoreline erosion, attenuate waves, and reduce coastal flooding (Costanza et al. 2008).Costanza R., O. Perez-Maqueo, M.L. Martinez, P. Sutton, S.J. Anderson, and K. Mulder. 2008. The value of coastal wetlands for hurricane protection. Ambio 37: 241‚Äì248. However, the marsh's natural ability to buffer against erosion and flooding may be reduced by creek bank die-off. Since Spartina alterniflora is responsible for sediment binding and peat deposition (Redfield 1965),Redfield, A.C. 1965 Ontogeny of a salt marsh estuary. Science 147: 50‚Äì55. cordgrass die- off may compromise the ability of salt marshes to keep pace with sea-level rise. Also, the concentration of Sesarma burrows in New England salt marsh peat may directly trigger the erosion and collapse of the peat foundation of marshes. On Cape Cod, marsh creek banks are often so riddled with Sesarma burrows that they collapse, exposing fresh peat to further burrowing and erosion (Bertness et al. 2008). Feedbacks between crab herbivory and cordgrass die-off may thus lead to the retreat of marsh edges. For example, Coverdale and colleagues found that 20 years of die-off on Cape Cod have resulted in the loss of over 200 years of marsh accretion and hundreds of acres of marsh loss.Coverdale, T. C., E. W. Young, S.F. Yin, C. P. Brisson, J. P. Donnelly and M. D. Bertness. 2014. Indirect human impacts reverse centuries of carbon sequestration and salt marsh accretion. PLoS One, 9(3): e93296. The detrimental effects trophic cascades have had on marshes not only reduce the biodiversity, health, and aesthetic appeal of these ecosystems, but also compromise the ability of marshes to provide key ecosystem services to human populations. Conclusions Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, bottom-up control remains the central dogma determining marsh management, conservation and restoration efforts. Salt marshes are currently managed as if they are exclusively regulated by physical factors. However, global and near shore top predator depletion leading to the release of cryptic or unappreciated herbivores may be the biggest current threat to salt marshes. Theory dependency (subconscious favoring of identifying and/or examining natural phenomena that tend to confirm rather than refute the current paradigm of a study system [Kuhn 1962]Kuhn, T. 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois.) and demonstration, rather than falsifying science, have been the leading culprits in this oversight. Consequently, threats to salt marshes that are governed by top down control are being overlooked, with potentially devastating consequences. Trophic cascades are powerful interactions that strongly regulate biodiversity, community structure, and ecosystem function. Trophic cascades were originally thought to be rare, but it has become clear that they occur across diverse terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems at both small and large spatial and temporal scales. Trophic cascades are common and pervasive aspects of many communities long thought to be controlled by bottom- up forces and/or resistant to consumer control. Conservation of ecosystems affected by trophic cascades has thus not adequately incorporated top-down control into their management and restoration plans and efforts, but emerging research has emphasized that this is necessary to protect the services provided by these ecosystems and to restore these ecosystems to their original conditions. Failure to do so could lead to trophic cascades transforming highly diverse and productive plant communities to barren flats. Additionally, failure to reevaluate the current paradigm and recognize that both bottom-up and top-down forces affect many features of ecosystem structure and function, and that these forces are complementary rather than contradictory, could bar any incorporation of both mechanisms into any management plan and reduce the success of conservation efforts before they even begin.

Family  Hamdawi belonged to a distinguished and rich family of noble origins, and had his own palace, which, according to Farrukhi Sistani, was \\"finer than the palace of Kisra\\". This has recently made some scholars claim that Hamdawi's ancestry goes back to ancient Persian families.  Biography  Hamdawi, during his youth, served in the Ghaznavid army, and was also a student (or assistant) of Ahmad Maymandi. He later entered the court of Mahmud of Ghazni, where he shortly was appointed as the fiscal administrator of the Ghaznavid capital of Ghazni and India. In 1030, Mahmud died and was succeeded by his son Muhammad, who appointed Hamdawi as his vizier, but was, however, shortly overthrown by his more experienced brother Mas'ud I, who shortly appointed Ahmad Maymandi as his vizier, while appointing Hamdawi as the fiscal administrator of the entire Ghaznavid Empire.

In 1033, Hamdawi was appointed as the governor of Jibal, which was then held under the control of the Kakuyid ruler Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar, who was a vassal of the Ghaznavids. However, Muhammad kept rebelling against Mas'ud I, and Hamdawi was shortly sent to deal with the latter, which he managed to accomplish. During the same period, Hamdawi had to protect Jibal from marauding Oghuz Turks who had arrived in the region from their steppes north to Khwarazm. Hamdawi managed to defeat the Turks, and then had their chief including another important member of their group captured. However, the Ghaznavids were never able to destroy the power of the Kakuyids, who managed to keep their domains as Ghaznavid vassals. In 1036/7, Hamdawi was repelled from Jibal by Muhammad, and was forced to withdraw to Nishapur, which was then also under constant invasions by the Oghuz Turks. In 1038, the Oghuz Turks captured Nishapur, which forced its governor Abu'l-Fadl Suri and Hamdawi to flee to Gurgan. During this period, Mas'ud I appointed Hamwudi as his chief advisor.

Founded in 1971, and later expanding into Finland and Estonia, the Swedish parent business went bankrupt in 2011, with some stores being purchased by rival chain Expert. However, the group's former Estonian subsidiary continues operating under the Onoff name following a management buyout in 2011. History =Early years= The business was started in 1971 by Hans Westin, who imported Japanese audio products, and in 1973 the company went full-time. The first actual store was opened in 1976 in √Ökersberga. The Onoff name was established in 1982 when the company- then known as Telecall- bought up Sigges radio and changed its name to Onoff. In 1985, a head office was built in Upplands V√§sby. =Expansion into Finland and Estonia= In 2001, Onoff established operations and shops in Finland and Estonia. In July 2011, Sweden had 67 Onoff stores and 7 in Estonia and Finland. A large part of Onoffs' revenue came from consumer finance business Resursgruppen they ran with SIBA. Resursgruppen operations include consumer credit and insurance when buying electronics via chain stores. In 2005, gains from this aspect of the business were greater than from the companies' sale of goods themselves. =Bankruptcy= On 11 July 2011 it was announced via press release that the company had filed for bankruptcy in the Attunda courthouse. Stores in Estonia were part of a subsidiary and not affected by the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy administrator announced that the entire company would be sold with the 6 stores in Estonia together with the 67 Swedish stores and a central warehouse. The Onoff brand was not included in the deal. The group's Estonian subsidiary was purchased through a management buyout in 2011 and still continues to operate under the Onoff name . On 20 July 2011, the Swedish operation of consumer electronics chain Expert announced they would buy 30 of the total 67 stores and the central warehouse. From 1 August 2011, these stores became part of the Expert chain. Expert estimated with this takeover they would have a market share in Sweden of about 12-13 percent.

Another version of the game was released by Bit Corporation under the name Dancing Plates which features oriental-themed graphics and adds eight game variations. Dishaster was inspired by the circus tradition of keeping spinning plates suspended on poles. The player controls a girl attempting to keep a group of several spinning plates balanced on poles from falling. The game received negative reviews; criticism focused on the game's repetition and monotony. Gameplay Four plates are in play The girl can stabilize wobbling dishes by pressing the button on the controller. If a plate falls, the player is able to capture it if the girl touches it before it hits the ground, and a new one appears at the top of the pole. The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest. The player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground. Reception The reviewer for TV Gamer magazine wrote, in 1983, \\"Dishaster may be enjoyed by very young gamers, but it is not sophisticated enough for any battle-hardened arcade gamers.\\" Non-contemporary reviews were negative. Author Brett Weiss stated that Dishaster was \\"as bad as its unfunny title implies\\" and that it was \\"a hopelessly repetitive game\\".

It was located between Lake Parker and Lake Bonny. The community of Acton, Florida dispersed after the freeze of 1890. The Reverend John H. Weddell petitioned Bishop Weed to move the church building to the corner of Lemon Street and Massachusetts Avenue in nearby Lakeland in 1892. A stained glass window in the northeast corner of the present nave memorializes Rev. Weddell's efforts. By the early 1920s the Rev. G. Irvine Hiller led the parish in building a new church. The old church was torn down and the first service in the newly completed nave was conducted on February 24, 1924. This building remains in use as the oldest continuing church in the downtown area and was recognized as a part of Historic Lakeland in 1992. Four new bells were hung in the bell tower in 2006 and a new four-story building was dedicated in 2012. This new building contains classrooms, music rehearsal rooms and a new parish fellowship hall.

Early life  Smith was born in San Francisco, California in 1961 to Maurice Smith, a neurosurgeon, and homemaker Carolyn Smith. He is the middle child of three sons. Smith's interest in artistry was subsequently inspired by his maternal grandfather Charles, a wood carver. By the age of 15, Smith had begun to carve wooden duck decoys. He then entered Montana State University to major in economics. He graduated with honors, and also enrolled in several art courses. In the fall of 1980, he held his first gallery show at Gallery 85 in Billings, Montana, and sold every piece he exhibited. Smith exchanged wood for bronze upon graduating in 1983, and promptly cast his first bronze sculpture the following year, a trumpeter swan in 12 editions, and sold every edition upon casting.  Later years  In 1990 Smith converted the historic building into a studio and gallery that would showcase his work for the next six years. Smith opened a gallery at 47 West Osceola Street in 1997, situated across from the historic Lyric Theater.  Style and methods  Smith is characterized as a representational sculptor, and though stylistically he may be viewed as a naturalist, his signature aesthetic can be deemed \\"loose\\" wherein the subjects of his work are represented by their basic elements, with fingerprints giving the suggestion of feathers or fur.  Stuart Sailfish  The Stuart Sailfish is an 18 ft bronze monument sculpted by Geoffrey Smith and cast by Eagle Bronze Incorporated, located in Lander, Wyoming. The 3,000 lb sculpture, installed in 2003 in the center of the \\"Sailfish Circle\\" roundabout at Dixie Highway and Joan Jefferson way, was created with special architectural armature, enabling it to withstand wind gusts of up to 200 mph, an essential in an area frequently hit by hurricanes. Since its installation on January 2, 2003, it has since been adopted as the symbol of the city of Stuart, Florida, a location deemed \\"The Sailfish Capital of the World.\\" The Lotus \\"Rising Above\\" The Lotus \\"Rising Above\\" by Geoffrey C.

Paris, Biblioth√®que nationale de France, MS lat. 4404 is a medieval manuscript from the 9th century containing, among other legal texts, the Breviary of Alaric, and is notable also for containing illustrations of rulers. The earliest examples of illustrations of rulers may have been illuminations in legal manuscripts, with lat. 4404 frequently cited as an instance: its frontispiece depicts Theodosius, Valentian, Marcian, and Majorian. The Breviary of Alaric is the only text in the manuscript with annotations. The version of the Lex Salica was called a shortened version by Georg Heinrich Pertz, but Jean Marie Pardessus and Georg Waitz referred to it as amplification. Waitz, following Pardessus, refers to the Lex Salica in 4404 as \\"the only manuscript where no trace of Christianity can be found\\", apparently neglecting the introduction to the text which speaks of the Franks as a people of God. While those authors saw in the version in 4404 \\"the most ancient\\" version of the text, Simon Stein argues that the number of mistakes alone is sufficient to prove that this is not the case. Provenance The manuscript hails from Gaul, early 9th century, most likely from Tours or thereabouts. Some date and locate it more precisely‚ÄîSamuel Collins dates production in 804, in the Tours scriptorium. A note by √âtienne Baluze (1630-1718) explains that the manuscript came from Gallia Narbonensis and became part of the library of Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-1683).

The film had a sequel \\"Una Viuda descocada\\" (1980), which was B√≥'s last film. Production The 90-minute comedy film was made in 1967 for Sociedad Independiente Filmadora Argentina by director Armando B√≥. The script was by Armando B√≥ and music by Elijio Ayala Mor√≠n. The film was shot entirely in San Pedro, Buenos Aires Province. This was the last film in which Pepe Arias appeared, and was released after his death. He looks tired beside Isabel Sarli. Synopsis The film is one of several made by B√≥ that depicted stupid men who desire Isabel Sarli, others being La mujer del zapatero and La viuda descocada. The characters that Sarli plays exploit men's lust to obtain money and power. The comedies, set in villages, take the form of a series of sketches with an improvisational element, similar to classical stage revues. In La se√±ora del intendente Flor Tetis (Isabel Sarli) has the entire male population of the small village of \\"Omb√∫ Quemado\\" under her thumb. The local doctor, Amable Gambetta (Pepe Arias), offers to marry her, since it will improve his chances of being elected mayor. Soon the combination of her sexual demands and political problems make him want to resign. There is a strong political element in the film, made at a time when Peronism was banned. Reality intrudes into the action. In one scene, a committee of censors arrives at the mayor's office to ban presentation of a cycle of films by B√≥ starring Sarli.

It contains a single species, Zhanghenglong yangchengensis, represented by a disarticulated and partial cranium and postcranial skeleton. Discovery and naming Maxilla of the type specimen In 2011, at Zhoujiagou in Henan the remains were uncovered of a euornithopod. In 2014, the type species Zhanghenglong yangchengensis was named and described by Xing Hai, Wang Deyou, Han Fenglu, Corwin Sullivan, Ma Qingyu, He Yiming, David Hone, Yan Ronghao, Du Fuming and Xu Xing. The generic name combines the name of the first century Chinese scientist Zhang Heng with long, Mandarin for \\"dragon\\". The specific name refers to Yangcheng, an administrative unit during the Eastern Zhou, partially coinciding with the present Henan. The holotype, XMDFEC V0013, was found in the Majiacun Formation dating from the middle Santonian, about eighty-five million years old. It consists of a partial skull and lower jaw, including the right maxilla, the right jugal and the right dentary. The paratype is XMDFEC V0014, a partial skeleton lacking the skull, including five back vertebrae, ribs, a shoulder blade and the right ulna. Taxonomic status Zhanghenglong is probably a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid based on a series of plesiomorphic features present in this taxon. The new genus and species significantly differs from other known members of Hadrosauroidea in having two distinct autapomorphies (strongly deflected posteroventrally posterior third of the maxilla relative to the anterior two thirds of it and dentary teeth with crowns of both median and distally offset primary ridges) and a unique combination of features. Despite the confluence of some plesiomorphic features typical of non- hadrosaurid hadrosauroids, Zhanghenglong possesses some derived characters seen in hadrosaurids, as well as two transitional features that are intermediate between the corresponding plesiomorphic and derived characters of hadrosauroids. This taxon may therefore represent a relatively derived non- hadrosaurid hadrosauroid, and is thought to be one of the closest relatives to Hadrosauridae.

Orkin photographed Craig as she walked around Florence capturing images of her shopping at markets, flirting in caf√©s, viewing landmarks, and other travel experiences. The most iconic of the photos is known as American Girl in Italy and shows Craig walking down a street being ogled by a group of men. Many interpret the photograph as one of harassment and chauvinism. In 2014, Craig said: \\"At no time was I unhappy or harassed in Europe\\". \\"[The photograph is] not a symbol of harassment. It's a symbol of a woman having an absolutely wonderful time!\\" She has also noted that \\"Italian men are very appreciative, and it's nice to be appreciated. I wasn't the least bit offended.\\" Later life After her trip, Craig returned to New York City and worked as a teacher and an ad writer. She was married to an Italian and lived with him in Milan, but later divorced. After returning to New York, she met a Canadian man, married him, and moved to Toronto.

History  During the Majapahit kingdom in the 15th century, Bambu Runcing fighting was practiced on the island of Java. The fights were performed in front of the king and queen in an open field. Both parties are headed by one man holding a Bambu Runcing, accompanied by their wives and servants. Their wives are armed with wooden staff with a length of about 1 m. Upon the signal of the drum, both men will fight three rounds with the Bambu Runcing. When their wives begin to shout \\"Larak, larak\\" (which means, retreat in Javanese language), so will the fight too for a moment. In an event where one of the men died from stabbing, the king will then order the victor to compensate the family of the dead, but the wife of the dead will be his. During the war of independence in Indonesia, the lack of weaponry forced Indonesians to turn to bamboo again. Bambu Runcing became a well-known weapon in modern Indonesian history. This weapon was used by the Indonesian people as a means of resistance against the colonial Dutch. Today the symbol of the Bambu Runcing is widely used in various regions in Indonesia to symbolize courage and sacrifice in achieving independence. K. H. Subchi, of Parakan, Temanggung, was given the informal title Jenderal Bambu Runcing (General Spiked Bamboo).

The University of North Carolina academic-athletic scandal involved alleged fraud and academic dishonesty committed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Following a lesser scandal that began in 2010 involving academic fraud and improper benefits with the university's football program, two hundred questionable classes offered by the university's African and Afro- American Studies department (commonly known as AFAM) came to light. As a result, the university was placed on probation by its accrediting agency. An internal investigation by the university released in 2011 and another investigation commissioned by former North Carolina governor Jim Martin in 2012 found numerous academic and ethical issues with the AFAM department, including unauthorized grade changes and faculty signatures, a disproportionate number of independent study class offerings relative to other departments, and an over-representation of student-athletes enrolled in such classes. Then in 2014 began charges and counter-charges between university officials and former learning specialist Mary Willingham, including disputes about statistics and methods of analysis by Willingham alleging that certain student-athletes were not academically qualified for college. As a result of these revelations, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed the university on probation for one year, endangering the university's regional accreditation. Losing accreditation would have resulted in the loss of any federal funding or support. The university introduced new standards, protocols and rules to prevent misadministration within academic departments in the future. As a result, UNC exited probation and regained full standing by June 2016. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) then completed its own investigation in October 2017, finding no violations of its rules, largely due to the fact that the NCAA does not have oversight authority for university academic programs.https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Oct2017_University- of-North-Carolina-at-Chapel-Hill_InfractionsDecision_20171013.pdf The controversy sparked debate as to whether the university educated some of its student-athletes improperly and called into question the role of NCAA Division I athletics relative to the academic mission of NCAA-member colleges and universities.July 9, 2014, News Observer, Dan Kane, At US Senate hearing, NCAA's Emmert pledges to work for change, Accessed July 15, 2014, \\"... With several United States senators at a hearing Wednesday questioning whether the NCAA and its member schools care about the well-being of college athletes. ... \\" Background =North Carolina football scandal= Greg Barnes of Inside Carolina initially broke the scandal with ESPN following closely behind. On July 15, 2010, ESPN reported that the NCAA interviewed several North Carolina football players over alleged gifts, extra benefits, and sports agent involvement. Reportedly, the investigation began after North Carolina defensive tackle Marvin Austin made a post on Twitter on May 29 that year, and the post contained a reference to a nightclub in Miami in which a sports agent's party had taken place two months earlier. The university later suspended Austin and over ten other football players from the team. On October 11, 2010, Austin was expelled from the football team, and the NCAA declared wide receiver Greg Little and defensive end Robert Quinn \\"permanently ineligible\\" due to receiving improper benefits. On August 26, 2010, the NCAA began a separate investigation of North Carolina football that involved possible academic fraud involving a tutor in the university's academic support program. The tutor was later identified as Jennifer Wiley ( known as Jennifer Wiley Thompson due to marriage). Another source familiar with the investigation said that Wiley was accused of \\"inappropriate help on papers that football players were required to write for classes.\\" However, Baddour said on September 24 that Wiley declined to cooperate with the NCAA. Because the university felt that the NCAA investigation was extremely embarrassing to the university's reputation, North Carolina fired football head coach Butch Davis on July 27, 2011. The next day, athletic director Dick Baddour announced that he would resign and allow chancellor Holden Thorp to hire a football head coach. Published in print as \\"Baddour announces decision to step down as UNC- CH AD.\\" On March 12, 2012, the NCAA issued formal sanctions against North Carolina football: a postseason ban for 2012, reductions of 15 scholarships, and 3 years of probation. The NCAA found North Carolina guilty of multiple infractions, including academic fraud and failure to monitor the football program. However, the NCAA did not find anything extending to lack of institutional control, explaining that the university \\"educated its tutors regarding academic improprieties and its coaches regarding outside athletically related income ... self-discovered the academic fraud and took decisive action ... cooperated fully, is not a repeat violator and ... exhibited appropriate control over its athletics program.\\" In November 2013, the university sent a letter of disassociation to Austin, Little, and Quinn. Academic irregularities and punishment The crux of the alleged irregularities proceeded from the UNC Department of African and Afro-American Studies. Over approximately fifteen years, the department offered two hundred independent study courses, many without full adherence to University procedure for course provisioning or sufficient professorial oversight. The irregularities called into question the Department's academic integrity and led to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools putting the university on academic probation for one year, a rare action against a major research university.http://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/unc-academic- scandal-leaves-university-in-peril-beyond-athletics/ =Overview= The March 3, 2014 Bloomberg BusinessWeek magazine had a cover story by Paul M. Barrett alleging academic improprieties by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill regarding student-athletes. A basic charge by critics was that UNC did not live up to its end of the bargain by not sufficiently educating some of its student-athletes. Rebecca Schuman of Slate.com accused the university of \\"abjectly failing some of its students\\" by keeping them \\"functionally illiterate.\\" Gerald Gurney, president of the Drake Group for Academic Integrity in College Sport, called UNC \\"the mother of all academic fraud violations\\" because of \\"cooperation of friendly faculty and [a] cover-up.\\" Paul M. Barrett, in a cover story for the March 3, 2014 Bloomberg Businessweek magazine, wrote: \\"... rather than seriously investigate the connection between sports and classroom corruption, top university administrators used vague committee reports to obfuscate the issue.\\" Reporter Dan Kane of the News & Observer was part of a three-person investigative team which exposed the scandal, despite substantial resistance by the university, according to a subsequent report in the New York Times. Kane has been criticized by detractors for leading a \\"wrongheaded effort\\" to link college sports with academic improprieties; college administrators \\"no longer take his calls\\", and some faculty describe his efforts as a witch hunt for a conspiracy that does not exist. =Initial accusations= Suspicions about the UNC Department of African and Afro-American Studies were raised as early as 2011. UNC defensive end Michael McAdoo filed a lawsuit against the NCAA on July 1, 2011 seeking reinstatement to the football team. The NCAA declared McAdoo ineligible for accepting improper benefits and committing academic fraud, based on the UNC Undergraduate Honor Court finding that McAdoo committed academic dishonesty by having Jennifer Wiley complete a bibliography and works-cited section on a research paper for an AFAM class. From this lawsuit, McAdoo was forced to make public the paper; an analysis by Dan Kane of the Raleigh News & Observer found that the Honor Court failed to find multiple instances of plagiarism in McAdoo's paper. On July 13, a North Carolina Superior Court judge in Durham refused to grant an injunction against the NCAA, thus upholding ineligibility for McAdoo. Then in August, Dan Kane reported that football player Marvin Austin took a 400-level course in the department the summer before his freshman fall semester. According to an academic adviser at the university, \\"it is unusual for any freshman to begin his or her college education with a 400 level course.\\" On September 1, 2011, just over a week after Kane's article about Austin's transcript was published, AFAM department chair Julius Nyang'oro resigned from his executive position but remained on faculty. More controversy for AFAM came after the transcript of former North Carolina football and basketball player Julius Peppers was found under a University of North Carolina web address (www.unc.edu) by members of PackPride, a Scout.com community for fans of rival school NC State. A university staffer originally posted the transcript with Peppers's identifying information removed on a secure UNC server as a test record in 2001. Six years later, another staffer mistakenly moved the test record to an unsecured server. The transcript showed a cumulative grade point average of 1.82 from the summer 1998 to spring 2001 terms with 11 grades of D or F. Additionally, Peppers's grades for AFAM classes were on average higher than for non-AFAM classes, and Peppers was never academically ineligible for athletic competition despite his grades. Through his agent, Peppers confirmed that the transcript was his and stated that there was \\"no academic fraud.\\" University chancellor Holden Thorp later apologized to Peppers. =Reviews of AFAM= Former North Carolina governor Jim Martin commissioned a 2012 report that reviewed irregularities in the UNC Department of African and Afro-American Studies. On May 2, 2012, UNC released the results of an internal investigation into AFAM courses commissioned by Jonathan Hartlyn, senior associate dean for social sciences and global programs, and William L. Andrews, senior associate dean for fine arts and humanities. The report examined AFAM classes from the summer 2007 to summer 2011 sessions. Among the findings in the Hartlyn-Andrews report: *Thirty-six percent of students enrolled in questionable AFAM classes were football players. *There was no evidence showing that student-athletes who took AFAM classes received preferential treatment. *AFAM administrator Deborah Crowder likely oversaw scheduling and grade rosters of questionable classes. *Nearly nine classes lacked evidence that a professor taught course material and graded work. For one Swahili class, the syllabus listed AFAM chair Julius Nyang'oro as professor, but Nyang'oro told university investigators that he did not teach that class. For 40 other courses listing Nyang'oro as instructor, mostly during summer sessions, a professor was present during class but seldom taught. =Martin Report (2012)= On December 19, 2012, UNC released a report, commissioned by former North Carolina governor Jim Martin, in collaboration with accounting firm Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP. The report examined data back to the 1990s. Among its findings: *Student-athletes were disproportionately enrolled in suspect classes. *From the 1990s through 2011, AFAM offered two hundred lecture courses that never took place, as well as offering dubious independent study programs that required little work to complete. Also, some professors never showed up to teach classes. In some instances, the only course requirement of students was to submit a paper at the end of the class. * In \\"dozens of instances\\", eight professors \\"were unwittingly and indirectly compromised\\" when their signatures were forged by others on grade rosters. However, no evidence showed that any other faculty member than Julius Nyang'oro or Deborah Crowder was involved in wrongdoing. *Among grade changes for student-athletes, 106 were identified as \\"unauthorized\\", 454 as \\"potentially unauthorized\\", 373 were \\"inconclusive\\", and 203 were legitimate.Martin Report, pp. 8-9. There were felony fraud charges brought against Nyang'oro for being paid $12,000 to teach a non- existent class, but these charges were dropped by the Orange County district attorney based on recommendations from Kenneth Wainstein in exchange for Nyang'oro's cooperation.Sara Ganim, CNN, July 3, 2014, Charges dropped in University of North Carolina 'paper classes' case, Accessed July 15, 2014, \\"... ex-professor Julius Nyang'oro would no longer be facing a felony fraud charge ...\\" =Accusations by Mary Willingham= CNN reporter Sara Ganim brought national attention to former learning specialist Mary Willingham's accusations against the University of North Carolina regarding student- athletes and academics. One of the academic tutors assigned to help student- athletes was Mary Willingham, who was hired by the university in 2003 to assist student-athletes with their academic work. Willingham's 2009 Master of Arts thesis for the University of North Carolina at Greensboro was titled Academics & athletics - a clash of cultures: Division I football programs and asserted in part: \\"While admission standards are on the rise at major public universities, many under-prepared student-athletes (football) are admitted each year because they are the 'best' player in the state/country, creating academic disparities.\\" In a November 2012 interview with Dan Kane of The News & Observer, Willingham made her initial claims about the university helping student-athletes stay eligible via improper assistance. In 2013, the Drake Group gave Willingham the Robert Maynard Hutchins Award for being \\"a university faculty or staff member who defends the institution's academic integrity in the face of college athletics.\\" Schere, Daniel, January 29, 2014, Daily Tarheel, Mary Willingham‚Äôs passion was shaped by her roots, Accessed July 15, 2014, \\"..She was awarded the 2013 Robert Maynard Hutchins award, ... stands up for academic integrity and often risks losing their job. ... \\" In early 2014, Willingham approached national media to express her concerns about the university. In interviews with Sara Ganim of CNN in January and Paul M. Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek in March, Willingham alleged: *Students accessed a team-maintained computer hard drive which contained a database of previous papers, and submitted recycled documents with cosmetic changes. * Some student-athletes reading below college levels. In an interview with CNN, Willingham claimed that 60% of 183 UNC football and basketball players, which she analyzed from 2004 to 2012, were reading at fourth- to eighth-grade levels, and that 10% read below a third-grade level. * She steered academically disadvantaged student-athletes towards enrolling in sham AFAM lecture courses. * The university was playing a \\"shell game\\" to prevent student-athletes from having to do any serious studying. In response to Willingham's claims about student-athlete literacy, UNC released another report by a board of educational experts outside the university that examined data between 2004 and 2012. That report found that there were 341 men's and women's basketball players and football players during these years; of this group, 34 students did not meet CNN's threshold of being \\"college literate\\", which meant a minimum SAT reading score of 400 or an ACT score of 16; essentially, the university suggested that of its athletes, ten percent had academic issues. This is in contrast with the allegation by Mary Willingham, based on her personal investigations, that 60% of college athletes were not \\"college literate\\". In another of her analyses, she found that 150 to 200 of 400 student-athletes were \\"underperforming\\", some \\"badly underperforming\\", with the last group being mostly made of men's and women's players of basketball and football. One view suggested that the university's response to these and other allegations was to try to change the focus away from wrongdoing, in part by challenging Willingham's assertions and research. The review board disputed her findings on the grounds that her methodology was not appropriate.BREAKING: UNC releases outside review of Mary Willingham's research, Accessed July 15, 2014, \\"... A series of emails released on November 29, 2015 containing 20,000+ pages of communications, including emails between Mary Willingham and other UNC staff members, seem to lend credence to the review board's refutation of Willinghams's methodology. Willingham never provided the methodology she used to come to her conclusions. Notwithstanding the fact that there is no methodology for combining multiple tests to determine grade levels, however there was one person who could completely confirm Willingham's findings. Lyn Johnson was the psychologist who administered and scored the tests in question and aggregated the data for the UNC academic support program. In a January 16, 2014 email exchange between Johnson and Willingham, Johnson requested Willingham to explain her conclusions, questioning \\"Where did you get the 60% reading below 8th grade level?\\" Willingham did not provide an explanation. That Johnson had to ask confirmed Willingham did not obtain her conclusions from Johnson. The exchange supported the review board's findings that Willinghams's methodology was not appropriate., Released November 29, 2015, \\"... Willingham was also interviewed by Bernard Goldberg in a report for HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel that was broadcast on March 25, 2014. The report was a general look at how some top NCAA Division I schools hire learning specialists like Willingham to help keep student-athletes eligible. A representative for UNC stated in response that HBO reported on \\"information that has previously been reported and discussed.\\" A segment by ESPN's Outside the Lines from March 25, 20143:00 mark of video \\"UNC Academic Scandal: Whistleblower, Former Athlete Speak Out \\" drew attention because Willingham showed a 146-word essay about Rosa Parks and claimed that an unnamed student-athlete at UNC earned an A-minus in an AFAM class for turning that essay in. However, according to Slate.com, the paper shown by Willingham \\"was most likely a draft of one piece of a take-home final for a legitimate introductory course.\\" The News & Observer stated in a clarification note to a story that mentioned that essay: \\"It is unclear what grade the student received for the essay. Willingham said it was a class that met, and had other assignments.\\" In April 2014, Willingham announced her resignation. In June 2014, Willingham filed a lawsuit against UNC. In August 2014, citing posts in the Scout.com UNC message board Inside Carolina, Dan Kane reported in The News & Observer that passages in Willingham's 2009 master's thesis appeared to be plagiarized. =Accusations by Rashad McCants= Rashad McCants, a member of the North Carolina basketball team that won the 2005 NCAA championship, received national attention for claiming to have had a substandard education at North Carolina. He met with Representative Tony C√°rdenas (left) to discuss NCAA reform issues. On June 6, 2014, the ESPN program Outside the Lines broadcast an interview with Rashad McCants, who was a starter on the North Carolina basketball team that won the 2005 NCAA championship, in which McCants claimed to have taken phony classes and had tutors write his classwork. However, all sixteen other members of the 2005 team released a statement which disputed McCants's account. Additionally, coach Roy Williams, separately interviewed by the same program, disputed McCants's claims. In contrast, in a noted 2004 interview with television station WRAL, McCants compared attending UNC with being in jail. Original AP wire title: \\"McCants Says He Likes Being at Carolina\\" Interviewed again on Outside the Lines on June 11, McCants stood by his claims about his academic experience at North Carolina. He also called on his fellow members of the 2004‚Äì05 basketball team to release their university transcripts because, in his opinion, \\"the truth is there in the transcripts\\" regarding bogus classes. University officials contacted McCants via mail and text message in the days following ESPN's initial interview with McCants, because McCants expressed \\"knowledge of potential NCAA rule violations involving the University of North Carolina,\\" according to a letter signed by the athletics director of compliance. However, McCants had not responded as of July 7, nor had he discussed his claims with the NCAA, according to the Associated Press. Actions by the university = Wainstein Report (2014) = Former U.S. Department of Justice official Kenneth L. Wainstein commissioned an independent investigative report of the UNC AFAM department. In February 2014, the university hired Kenneth L. Wainstein, a former official in the United States Department of Justice, to conduct an independent investigation.Scott Gleeson, USA TODAY, June 30, 2014, NCAA reopens investigation of North Carolina athletics, Accessed July 15, 2014, \\"... The NCAA notified the University of North Carolina it will reopen its 2011 investigation of academic irregularities, ...\\" On October 22, 2014, the report was released reporting that for 18 years, at least 3,100 students took \\"nonexistent\\" classes, saying, \\"These counselors saw the paper classes and the artificially high grades they yielded as key to helping some student-athletes remain eligible.\\" The report named both Julius Nyang'oro and Debbie Crowder as facilitators of the practice. = Reforms = More than 70 reforms have been instituted. These included better governance standards, more accountability for support programs for student-athletes, new department structures, and more classroom audits and oversight of courses, according to a university source. Employees called checkers were sent to classes to see whether, in fact, they were being held, as part of an improved auditing system. Further, university officials made statements which affirmed that they were proud of the accomplishments of their sports programs and varsity teams. An athletics director spoke highly of the university's scholarship program; one said most of their student-athletes graduate and have successful careers. Some officials criticized the allegations; for example, a basketball coach objected that the allegations had slandered the \\"moral character of his players.\\" Conclusion North Carolina versus Michigan State basketball game On October 13, 2017, the NCAA announced it would not levy penalties against North Carolina, saying it \\"could not conclude that the University of North Carolina violated N.C.A.A. academic rules.\\" In their defense, North Carolina cited cases where Auburn and Michigan had similar misconduct and the NCAA did not act. It was ultimately concluded by the panel that the courses were for the entire student body, not just the student-athletes. The panel did conclude that since Nyang'oro did not cooperate with the investigation he was issued a five-year show-cause period as punishment for him, \\"any NCAA member school employing the [Nyang'oro] must show cause why he should not have restrictions on athletically related activity.\\" Committee on Infractions head for the NCAA, Greg Sankey, stated \\"While student-athletes likely benefited from the so-called 'paper courses' offered by North Carolina, the information available in the record did not establish that the courses were solely created, offered and maintained as an orchestrated effort to benefit student-athletes.\\" North Carolina chancellor Carol Folt commented on the resolution of the case when she said \\"I believe we have done everything possible to correct and move beyond the past academic irregularities and have established very robust processes to prevent them from recurring.\\" Tyrone P. Thomas, a lawyer for Mintz Levin and does work with colleges and universities, felt the ruling was \\"... a massive loophole, and from the P.R. side it looks horrible ‚Äî these athletes can do what they do, and it looks horrible. But guess what? Maybe that's not the N.C.A.A.'s job. This is something the schools have always self-regulated.\\"  See also  List of sporting scandals  References   External linksUNC Scandal: Ongoing coverage by The News & Observer *Martin Report on academic anomalies at UNC *Mary Willingham Archive at the University of South Carolina North Carolina at Chapel Hill academics-athletics scandal North Carolina at Chapel Hill academics-athletics scandal Academics-athletics scandal Academics- athletics scandal Whistleblowing in the United States North Carolina at Chapel Hill academics-athletics scandal 2011 scandals North Carolina at Chapel Hill academics-athletics scandal North Carolina at Chapel Hill academics-athletics scandal North Carolina at Chapel Hill academics- athletics scandal 2011 in North Carolina Academic scandals ","title":"University of North Carolina academic-athletic scandal"},{"id":"42983335","title":"Jo√´l Karekezi"},{"id":"42983345","text":"Jes√∫s, also called Barrio Jes√∫s, is a district of the Santa B√°rbara canton, in the Heredia province of Costa Rica. The district consists of several large neighborhoods: Altagracia, Birr√≠, Catalina, Com√∫n, Cuesta Colorada, La M√°quina, Guachipelines, Guaracha, and Ulises. History Like the rest of the canton, before the Spanish settlers came, Jes√∫s was originally occupied by the Huetares, an indigenous tribe. The Huetare King, Cacique Garabito, dominated the area. In early 1663, settler Joseph de Sandoval Ocampo arrived in the region of Jes√∫s in order to set up a cattle farm. Heredia, Barva, and Alajuela, three neighboring cities, were populated and settled in the late 1700s. As trade increased between the three cities, the canton developed. Jes√∫s officially became a district in the canton of Santa B√°rbara on 7 December 1848. This official recognition from the national government came when Santa B√°rbara was declared the fourth canton of Heredia Province, thanks to the efforts of Gregorio Salazar. By 1852, resident Horacio Morales had successfully lobbied Jes√∫se√±os to construct a small chapel in the district. By 1885, there were two public schools for children in Jes√∫s. One was for boys and one was for girls.6 Jes√∫s was one of the last of Santa B√°rbara's districts to receive running water, sometime after 1911. It was electrified in 1937. Geography and wildlife Jes√∫s has an area of km¬≤ and an elevation of metres. Major neighborhoods include Calle Sol√≠s, Mitad Sur de la Cuesta Colorada (Lower Red Hill), Quebrada la Cruz (Cruz River), Urbanizaci√≥n Cifuentes, Calle de Trapiche, Rosa Blanca (White Rose), La Teofila, and Central Jes√∫s. In the northwest of the district are the neighborhoods of Birr√≠, La Catalina, La Cuesta Colorada (Red Hill), and San Jos√© de Altagracia. Like much of Costa Rica, the Comisi√≥n Nacional de Prevenci√≥n de Riesgos (National Risk Prevention Commission) puts Jes√∫s in a high-risk zone. This is due to the district's mountainous geography, which can lead to landslides and flooding. Several large rivers run through Jes√∫s. These include Quebrada Burros, Quebrada Birr√≠, R√≠o Porrosati, and Quebrada Cruz. Over 60 different species of birds have been observed in Jes√∫s. Economy Fruit stand in La Maquina Neighborhood of Jes√∫s de Santa B√°rbara (de Heredia) The backbone of Jes√∫s' economy is agricultural production, particularly coffee. In 1973, 1,810 kilograms of coffee were produced in Jes√∫s. In addition, Jes√∫s is a major producer of sugarcane. There is an active recycling group in the district. There are various commercial businesses in Jes√∫s, including supermarkets, restaurants and corner stores. There is also a developed tourist industry in the district, which includes Hotel Rosa Blanca, a small, luxury hotel. Hotel Monte Campana, located in Birr√≠, includes ranches, swimming pools, and other activities. Another hotel in the district is La Catalina. There are businesses with stocked lakes and rivers for tourists interested in fishing. In addition, Caf√© Britt maintains a distribution center on Highway 128, west of central Jesus. Education and public services An EBAIS, Equipo B√°sico de Atenci√≥n Integral en Salud (Basic Medical Care Center), is located in Jes√∫s, serving residents and non-residents of the district. The Catholic Church serves the region through the Archdiocese of Alajuela. There are now three elementary schools in the district: Alfredo Volio Jim√©nez, located in Birr√≠, Alfredo Gonz√°lez Flores, located on highway 126, and Escuela Jes√∫s in central Jes√∫s.

It stated that the border amendments made by the Trianon Treaty were not final, and could be reviewed in the future. This give the Hungarian government the false impression that the treaty itself was only temporary, and so the delegation signed the treaty on June 4, 1920. Millerand, the Chairman of the Conference of Ambassadors On March 8, 1920, the Council of Foreign Ministers and Ambassadors discussed for the last time the new borders of Hungary in London, and Millerand was the chairman. Lloyd George questioned the viability of such border modifications, but Philippe Berthelot refused to do any adjustment at the last moment, so as a compromise, the council produced the Millerand Letter, as an annex to the Treaty. The letter stated: \\"in order to preempt any further discussion regarding territory, that the eventual modification of the designated boundaries would be referred to the boundary committees in accordance with the same conditions\\". The letter stated: \\"Examinations are to be done locally, and in some cases it might be necessary to move the borders stated in the treaty... if the border committees ... come to the conclusion ... that the declarations of the treaty are unfair, then they will have the possibility to report it to the Council of the League of Nations. In this case the Entente Powers agree to that, on request to one party involved, the League of Nations will offer its services to retain the original border, with the same conditions, in a peaceful way, in locations where the Council decides so.\\" Consequences The consequences of this annex were adverse for Hungary. It fed Hungarian revisionism and speeded up the signing and ratification of the Treaty both in the Hungarian Parliament and in England and France. L√©on Blum, politician of the French Socialist Party, published in the French newspaper Populaire that the cost of the help of Millerand would be to put the Hungarian State Railways rented to a French investment fund. According to the publication, if the railway was controlled by this fund, then Millerand would modify the borders in favour of Hungary. Millerand did not respond to this allegation, and it cannot be verified. It is fact that Millerand has receded to do any favour for Hungary afterward. The Trianon borders were later revised during the Munich Agreement (1938), during both Vienna Awards (1938 and 1940), and reconquering areas from Yugoslavia in 1941. All border modifications were resettled in 1947 according to the original treaty.

The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final Iron Age monument in this small chain of sites. The fort is located near the village of West Parley. Name Dudsbury takes its name from a man called Duds or Dudd, a 6th-century Saxon. Domesday records that \\"Azelin holds Dodsberie of Waleran. Godwin held it in King Edward's time and it was taxed for one hide. There is land to plough which is there, with four bordars, and seven acres of meadow and six of wood, pasture half a league long and five quarterns broad. It was and is worth 20s.\\" Description Dudsbury is an Iron Age hillfort situated on the north bank of the River Stour. The defences enclose a semicircular area of about 3 hectares and consist of double ramparts and ditch on the west, north and east sides, with a steep slope to the river on the south side. Much of the outer rampart and ditch has been obliterated or severely damaged. The best preserved portion lies near the southwest corner where the inner rampart stands 1.5 metres above the interior and 4 metres above the bottom of the outer ditch. The outer rampart there rises over 5 metres above the bottom of the ditch. There are four entrances to the hillfort, but probably only the west entrance, and possibly the south entrance, are original. Limited excavations were conducted by Heywood Sumner in 1921, but little was found except for some Iron Age pottery sherds on the northwest side. Later use Girl Guide building at Dudsbury The interior of the hillfort was used for agriculture for many years except for the northeast quadrant which has a house and garden. In 1930, fourteen acres were secured as a camp site for the Bournemouth Division of the Girl Guides Association from its then owner, Lord Wimborne, who, in sympathy with the scheme, generously parted with the land for a nominal sum. This section is now the Dudsbury Guide Camp.The entrance location is 50.783094 N, 1.891914 W The house and garden in the northeast quadrant is now occupied by the Warden of the Guide Camp.

One of the earliest applications of a non-commutative algebraic structure for cryptographic purposes was the use of braid groups to develop cryptographic protocols. Later several other non-commutative structures like Thompson groups, polycyclic groups, Grigorchuk groups, and matrix groups have been identified as potential candidates for cryptographic applications. In contrast to non-commutative cryptography, the currently widely used public-key cryptosystems like RSA cryptosystem, Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange and elliptic curve cryptography are based on number theory and hence depend on commutative algebraic structures. Non-commutative cryptographic protocols have been developed for solving various cryptographic problems like key exchange, encryption-decryption, and authentication. These protocols are very similar to the corresponding protocols in the commutative case. Some non-commutative cryptographic protocols In these protocols it would be assumed that G is a non-abelian group. If w and a are elements of G the notation wa would indicate the element a‚àí1wa. =Protocols for key exchange= Protocol due to Ko, Lee, et al. The following protocol due to Ko, Lee, et al., establishes a common secret key K for Alice and Bob. #An element w of G is published. #Two subgroups A and B of G such that ab = ba for all a in A and b in B are published. #Alice chooses an element a from A and sends wa to Bob. Alice keeps a private. #Bob chooses an element b from B and sends wb to Alice. Bob keeps b private. #Alice computes K = (wb)a = wba. #Bob computes K' = (wa)b=wab. #Since ab = ba, K = K'. Alice and Bob share the common secret key K. Anshel- Anshel-Goldfeld protocol This a key exchange protocol using a non-abelian group G. It is significant because it does not require two commuting subgroups A and B of G as in the case of the protocol due to Ko, Lee, et al. #Elements a1, a2, . . . , ak, b1, b2, . . . , bm from G are selected and published. #Alice picks a private x in G as a word in a1, a2, . . . , ak; that is, x = x( a1, a2, . . . , ak ). #Alice sends b1x, b2x, . . . , bmx to Bob. #Bob picks a private y in G as a word in b1, b2, . . . , bm; that is y = y ( b1, b2, . . . , bm ). #Bob sends a1y, a2y, . . . , aky to Alice. #Alice and Bob share the common secret key K = x‚àí1y‚àí1xy. #Alice computes x ( a1y, a2y, . . . , aky ) = y‚àí1 xy. Pre-multiplying it with x‚àí1, Alice gets K. #Bob computes y ( b1x, b2x, . . . , bmx) = x‚àí1yx. Pre-multiplying it with y‚àí1 and then taking the inverse, Bob gets K. Stickel's key exchange protocol In the original formulation of this protocol the group used was the group of invertible matrices over a finite field. #Let G be a public non-abelian finite group. #Let a, b be public elements of G such that ab ‚â† ba. Let the orders of a and b be N and M respectively. #Alice chooses two random numbers n < N and m < M and sends u = ambn to Bob. #Bob picks two random numbers r < N and s < M and sends v = arbs to Alice. #The common key shared by Alice and Bob is K = am + rbn + s. #Alice computes the key by K = amvbn. #Bob computes the key by K = arubs. =Protocols for encryption and decryption= This protocol describes how to encrypt a secret message and then decrypt using a non-commutative group. Let Alice want to send a secret message m to Bob. #Let G be a non-commutative group. Let A and B be public subgroups of G such that ab = ba for all a in A and b in B. #An element x from G is chosen and published. #Bob chooses a secret key b from A and publishes z = xb as his public key. #Alice chooses a random r from B and computes t = zr. #The encrypted message is C = (xr, H(t) \\\\oplus m), where H is some hash function and \\\\oplus denotes the XOR operation. Alice sends C to Bob. #To decrypt C, Bob recovers t as follows: (xr)b = xrb = xbr = (xb)r = zr = t. The plain text message send by Alice is P = ( H(t) \\\\oplus m ) \\\\oplus H(t) = m. =Protocols for authentication= Let Bob want to check whether the sender of a message is really Alice. #Let G be a non- commutative group and let A and B be subgroups of G such that ab = ba for all a in A and b in B. #An element w from G is selected and published. #Alice chooses a private s from A and publishes the pair ( w, t ) where t = w s. #Bob chooses an r from B and sends a challenge w ' = wr to Alice. #Alice sends the response w ' ' = (w ')s to Bob. #Bob checks if w ' ' = tr. If this true, then the identity of Alice is established. Security basis of the protocols The basis for the security and strength of the various protocols presented above is the difficulty of the following two problems: *The conjugacy decision problem (also called the conjugacy problem): Given two elements u and v in a group G determine whether there exists an element x in G such that v = ux, that is, such that v = x‚àí1 ux. *The conjugacy search problem: Given two elements u and v in a group G find an element x in G such that v = ux, that is, such that v = x‚àí1 ux. If no algorithm is known to solve the conjugacy search problem, then the function x ‚Üí ux can be considered as a one-way function. Platform groups A non-commutative group that is used in a particular cryptographic protocol is called the platform group of that protocol. Only groups having certain properties can be used as the platform groups for the implementation of non-commutative cryptographic protocols. Let G be a group suggested as a platform group for a certain non-commutative cryptographic system. The following is a list of the properties expected of G. #The group G must be well-known and well-studied. #The word problem in G should have a fast solution by a deterministic algorithm. There should be an efficiently computable \\"normal form\\" for elements of G. #It should be impossible to recover the factors x and y from the product xy in G. #The number of elements of length n in G should grow faster than any polynomial in n. (Here \\"length n\\" is the length of a word representing a group element.) Examples of platform groups =Braid groups= Let n be a positive integer.

The Grigorchuk's group Œì is the subgroup of A(T) generated by the automorphisms a, b, c, d defined as follows: * a(b_1,b_2,\\\\ldots, b_n) = (1-b_1,b_2,\\\\ldots, b_n) *b(b_1,b_2,\\\\ldots,b_n) = \\\\begin{cases} (b_1, 1-b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n) & \\\\text{ if } b_1=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ (b_1, c(b_2,\\\\ldots, b_n))&\\\\text{ if } b_1=1 \\\\end{cases} *c(b_1,b_2,\\\\ldots,b_n) = \\\\begin{cases} (b_1, 1-b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n) & \\\\text{ if } b_1=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ (b_1, d(b_2,\\\\ldots, b_n))&\\\\text{ if } b_1=1 \\\\end{cases} *d(b_1,b_2,\\\\ldots,b_n) = \\\\begin{cases} (b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n) & \\\\text{ if } b_1=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ (b_1, b(b_2,\\\\ldots, b_n))&\\\\text{ if } b_1=1 \\\\end{cases} =Artin group= An Artin group A(Œì) is a group with the following presentation: : A(\\\\Gamma) = \\\\left\\\\langle a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n  \\\\mu_{ij} = \\\\mu_{ji} \\\\text{ for } 1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n \\\\right\\\\rangle where \\\\mu_{ij} = a_ia_ja_i\\\\ldots (m_{ij} factors) and m_{ij} = m_{ji}. = Matrix groups = Let F be a finite field.

He played a major role in introducing German Romantic historical painting into Belgium. His fresco‚Äôs using oil paint heralded a revival of a colouristic style derived from Rubens and the Flemish Baroque combined with historical and psychological realism.Clare A. P. Willsdon, et al. \\"Mural.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 6 Apr. 2014 Life =Training= Jan Swerts was a student of the leading Antwerp history painter Nicaise De Keyser at the Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts.Biographical details at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Here he met Godfried Guffens, another pupil of De Keyser, who became a close friend. The two friends visited Paris together in 1648 where they saw paintings of Victor Orsel, a French follower of Johann Friedrich Overbeck. Overbeck was the leading painter of the German Romantic Nazarene movement, which aimed to revive honesty and spirituality in Christian art. Swerts and Guffens were so impressed by this style of painting that they decided to travel on to Germany where they visited the frescos painted by the Nazarenes. Boudewijn of Flanders leaves Marie of Champagne and their daughter Joan (Kortrijk City Hall fresco) They left in August 1850 and travelled to Aachen, K√∂ln, D√ºsseldorf, Remagen, Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig, Prague and Munich. In these various places they met with members of the Nazarene movement who were engaged in various monumental commissions. Finally, they arrived on 12 December 1850 in Rome where Overbeck resided. They returned to Belgium with the intention to implement the ideals of the Nazarenes in Belgium.Jean-Eugene- Emmanuel Swerts at the Biographie Nationale de Belgique =First commissions= Upon their return in Belgium the two friends got married on the same day, 25 October 1852. The following year the two young artists were commissioned to provide the decoration for the Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-van-Bijstand- der-Christenenkerk (Church of Our Lady of Assistance to Christians) in Sint- Niklaas, which had been constructed in the early 1840s. The initiative came from a local member of parliament and a local politician and was initially funded by the local community of believers. When funds ran out, the Belgian state provided an annual stipend of 1,500 francs from 1856 to 1861. The funds were part of a scheme by the Belgian Government to promote monumental art in Belgium as it was regarded as useful in promoting nationalism and a revival of the arts in the young Belgian state. The two artists where the first to receive an official commission for a secular monumental project when the Antwerp city government asked them to paint the walls of the newly restored Old Bourse of Antwerp with depictions of Antwerp‚Äôs glorious trading past. They were assisted by two students of the Antwerp Academy, the German Otto Schwerdgeburth and Florentinus Claes from Antwerp. These works were destroyed by fire just before the building was to be officially reopened.Anna Bergmans, Middeleeuwse muurschilderingen in de 19de eeuw: studie en inventaris van middeleeuwse muurschilderingen in Belgische kerken, Leuven University Press, 1 January 1998, p. 22 =Promoting monumental art= Priest giving a child her first lesson Swerts and Guffens were given funds by the Belgian government to attend a large exhibition of German art held in Munich in 1858 with the mission to report back. Their report conveniently concluded that monumental art should be supported as it was linked to religion and science, and was therefore national art. They also published a memoir on their trip to Germany under the title \\"Souvenirs d'un voyage artistique en Allemagne par J. Swerts et G. Guffens - Peintres d'Anvers\\" (Remembrances of an artistic trip to Germany by J. Swerts and G. Guffens, painters from Antwerp). In 1859 Swerts and Guffens organized in Brussels and Antwerp an exhibition of cartons of German masters, which had an important influence on the development of monumental art in Belgium. While they were still working on the murals in the Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-van-Bijstand-der-Christenenkerk in Sint-Niklaas, Swerts and Guffens started on a mural in the Church of Saint George (Sint-Joriskerk) in Antwerp. This was the largest work that they had undertaken thus far and they worked on the project from 1859 to 1871. The support of the Belgian Government for monumental art was, however, waning as it was not considered to be sufficiently in the Flemish tradition with its vivid colours, life and movement. Swerts and Godfrey Guffens received many commissions for murals with religious and historical subjects in the period from 1859 and 1871 including for the Saint Quentin Cathedral in Hasselt, the choir of the church of Lanaken, the choir of the Saint Joseph Church and the Saint Barbara Chapel in Louvain, the Chapel of the Aldermen in Ypres and the City Hall of Kortrijk. =Prague= Cardinal Prince of Schwarzenberg When Belgian government commissions dried up, Swerts accepted the post of director of the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague in 1874. He was received with enthusiasm. His students in Prague included Vojtƒõch Bartonƒõk, Felix Jenewein, Mikol√°≈° Ale≈° and Franti≈°ek ≈Ωen√≠≈°ek.Roman Prahl. \\"Jenewein, Felix.\\" Grove Art Online.

He died on 11 August 1879 in Marienbad where he had gone for a cure. Work The monumental art created by Jan Swerts and Guffens was very influential at the time and contributed to the spread of the Nazarene school's ideas in Belgium and beyond. Their work is now regarded as displaying the strengths and weaknesses of this school of painting: charm, simplicity of line but a cold appearance. The two artists also played a role as advisors on the practices for restoration of medieval art in Belgium. Jozef Janssens de Varebeke (Sint-Niklaas, 1854 ‚Äì Antwerp, 1930), a painter of religious and genre paintings as well as of portraits and frescoes was Swerts' pupil in Antwerp in 1872 and was heavily influenced by Swerts‚Äô style.R.Weigel, Archiv f√ºr die zeichnenden k√ºnste mit besonderer beziehung auf kupferstecher- und holzschneidekunst und ihre geschichte, Volumes 12-13 (Google eBook), 1866, p.122-124 References External links People from Antwerp 1820 births 1879 deaths 19th-century Belgian painters ","title":"Jan Swerts"},{"id":"42983840","text":"Viji Subramaniam, also known as Viji Shankar, (15 August 1952 ‚Äì 10 February 1995) was the daughter of noted North Indian singer Lakshmi ShankarKavita Das, \\"Lakshmi Shankar: A Life Journey That Echoes Indian Music‚Äôs Journey to the West\\", smithsonianapa.org, 6 November 2013 (retrieved 7 June 2014). and Rajendra Shankar, elder brother of sitarist Ravi Shankar.

Additionally, he was an All-Star for the first time in 2019. Professional career Chapman attended El Toro High School in Lake Forest, California. In 2011, as a senior, he had a .422 batting average. Undrafted out of high school in the 2011 MLB draft, he enrolled at California State University, Fullerton where he played college baseball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans. In 2014, his junior year, he slashed .312/.412/.498 with six home runs and 48 RBIs in 54 games. After the season, the Oakland Athletics selected Chapman in the first round of the 2014 MLB draft. After signing, he made his professional debut with the Rookie-level Arizona League Athletics. He was promoted to the Class-A Beloit Snappers after three games. In 50 games for Beloit, he batted .237 with five home runs and 20 RBIs. He also played in one game for the Double-A Midland RockHounds at the end of the season. His entire 2015 season was spent with the Class A-Advanced Stockton Ports where he batted .250 with 23 home runs and 57 RBIs in 80 games. Chapman was invited to major league Spring Training with the Athletics in 2016. He began the season with Midland, and after slashing .244/.335/.521 with 29 home runs and 83 RBIs in 117 games, was promoted to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds in August, where he finished the season batting .197 with seven home runs and 13 RBIs in 18 games. He was selected as the Texas League Player of the Year for 2016. Chapman started the 2017 season playing for Nashville. He suffered a wrist injury on a check swing in the first series of the season and spent two weeks on the disabled list. =Oakland Athletics= Chapman was promoted to the Athletics on June 15, 2017, to make his major league debut that night. In 49 games for Nashville prior to his promotion, he was batting .257 with 16 home runs and 30 RBIs. On June 16, Chapman had his first major league hit and collected 3 RBIs (including the go-ahead run) against the New York Yankees. On September 6, Chapman was thrown out of a game by umpire Mike Everitt for arguing with Los Angeles Angels catcher Juan Graterol. Chapman took exception to Graterol staring at the Oakland batters, and Graterol felt that the Athletics were trying to steal signs. He spent the remainder of the season with Oakland after his June 15 call-up, batting .234 with 14 home runs and 40 RBIs in 84 games. Chapman was placed on the disabled list on June 16, 2018 with a bruised right thumb and activated on July 3. Chapman finished his 2018 campaign batting .278 with 24 home runs and 68 RBIs, offering solid baserunning and excellent defense as well. He underwent ulnar sided sesamoid bone excision surgery on the thumb on October 16 in Los Angeles. On October 29, Chapman received a Fielding Bible Award. On November 4, Chapman received a Rawlings Gold Glove Award as well as winning the Rawlings Platinum Glove Award with his former high school teammate Nolan Arenado.

In 2019, Chapman excelled offensively, hitting 36 home runs with 91 RBI despite hitting .249/.342/.506 in 156 games as he struck out 147 times in 583 at bats. On September 12, 2020, Chapman decided to opt out for the remainder of the season due to hip tendinitis that would require surgery. In 2020 he batted .232/.276/.535 with 10 home runs and 25 RBIs as he struck out 54 times in 142 at bats. His strikeout percentage increased 13.6% from the prior year, the greatest increase among major league hitters. Player profile Chapman has a reputation of being an elite defender who has exceptional range, arm strength and arm accuracy. His arm strength allows him to play at a deeper depth to field a hard hit ball heading down his right side. He uses a two handed gather on forehand, and one handed backhand with a basketball defensive crouch to prevent the ball from sailing. Personal life His former El Toro High School teammate is fellow MLB third baseman, Nolan Arenado. During the off- season, Chapman is roommates with Houston Astros catcher Garrett Stubbs in California.

The regiment was organized in Knoxville in late 1861. It was composed mainly of men from counties such as Grainger, Blount, Sevier, Bradley, Washington, Jefferson, Bedford with others joining from North Georgia and Alabama. Colonel William Henry Carroll had a hard time acquiring weapons for his men, and there delivery to the regiment was delayed for several weeks. By December 9, 1861, Carroll had nearly 800 recruits but had only enough weapons for 200. A week later he was reprimanded by Judah P. Benjamin for not following his order to procure enough weapons, who also threatened to disband the regiment if this issue was not quickly resolved. Within a month, Carroll had armed his regiment and was on the march to meet up with the 38th Tennessee Infantry Regiment under Felix Zollicoffer. The 37th arrived at Mill Springs and were greeted joyously as reinforcements. The entire ordeal turned into a failure, and Zollicoffer died in battle. Carroll was criticized and resigned from his post as a consequence. Chesley Jarnigan, a 28-year-old merchant, took command of the 37th and commanded it until his death in the Battle of Chickamauga.

Gameplay in FlatOut places emphasis on demolition derby-style races, and features a sophisticated physics engine. 16 different cars are included, each with 5 different skins for them. The game is most known for car drivers flying through the windshield. In 2014, a Linux version of the game was released on GOG.com as part of the launch of Linux support. Features Modes in FlatOut include standard lap races, in either open environments or stadium laps, and demolition derby deathmatches, in which the driver of the sole-surviving vehicle declared the winner; both modes pit players against 7 computer-controlled opponents. The game also includes special events which require the player to toss the driver off of his/her vehicle and meet certain requirements. In career mode, pick up your future top racer from the junkyard. Winnings come in the form of cash, which allows players to purchase vehicle upgrades and new vehicles. FlatOut is noted for its extensive use of physics in vehicle damage and collisions; dents on vehicles may vary based on the type of accident, object and angle of impact (falling objects, for example, will damage mostly the upper areas of a car), while many roadside items react better to collisions from other vehicles. Ragdoll physics is also present in the game, with drivers capable of being tossed out of their car after high-impact crashes. This feature is extensively used in several special events, when the player is required to \\"toss\\" a driver to a specific distance, height, or target. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the PlayStation 2 version a score of all four sevens for a total of 28 out of 40. The Sydney Morning Herald gave the game a score of four-and-a-half stars out of five and stated, \\"The handling is remarkable, and the fact the tracks are littered with obstacles that bounce and crash realistically makes it all the more fun. Throw in excellent damage modelling and it's plain to see that this game has nailed the core mechanics of an addictive racer perfectly.\\" The Times gave the PS2 and Xbox versions a score of four stars out of five and stated that the truly suicidal \\"will be in awe of the driver's ability to launch himself fatally through the windscreen, screaming, while the rest of us will love the game's easy and responsive controls, and the authentic feel of the cars.\\" Detroit Free Press, however, gave the Xbox version a score of two stars out of four and said that \\"If [the game] were only a $20 title, I'd heartily recommend it. But $50 is a lot of money to pay to turn yourself into road splatter over and over again. It's flawed, though fun.\\" Maxim gave the game a score of two stars out of five and said it was \\"about as interesting as a public service announcement for seatbelts.\\" FlatOut was selected in 2017 for a collection of 100 classical Finnish games, which were presented on the opening of the Finnish Museum of Games in Tampere.Muistatko viel√§ n√§m√§ suomalaiset klassikkopelit?

Stehl√≠k returned to Czechoslovakia in 1945 and resumed his Czechoslovak Air Force career until 1948, when the new Communist government politically purged armed forces personnel who had served in Western armed forces. Stehl√≠k was remanded in prison for a year, demoted but then released without charge. Stehl√≠k was restricted to lowly civilian jobs until 1964, when the Communist government politically rehabilitated him and granted him a retired military rank. He died in post-Communist Czechoslovakia in 1991.  Early life  Stehl√≠k was born on 26 March 1915 at Pik√°rec in eastern Bohemia. He went to school at Str√°≈æek near Byst≈ôice nad Pern≈°tejnem. In 1936 Stehl√≠k started pilot training at the Elementary Pilot School in Prague. In 1937 he studied at non-officer school and later at the fighter school at Hradec Kr√°lov√© in northern Bohemia. Until 1939 he was pilot instructor at the 3rd Air Regiment at Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves in eastern Slovakia. On 29 September 1938 France and the United Kingdom signed the Munich Agreement, which forced Czechoslovakia to cede the Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. On 15 March 1939 Germany occupied Czechoslovakia and imposed the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, which the next day dissolved the Czechoslovak armed forces in its territory.  In France  On 5 June 1939 Stehl√≠k escaped across the border into Poland and thence travelled to France. On 3 September France and the UK declared war on Germany. On 17 November the French Government and Czechoslovak National Liberation Committee agreed that Czechoslovak airmen could join the French Air Force. Stehl√≠k was trained at Chartres airbase in central France. On 1 December he was posted to Groupe de Chasse III/3 which was equipped with Morane-Saulnier M.S.406C.1 fighter aircraft and later re-equipped with the more advanced Dewoitine D.520C.1. With these aircraft GC III/3 fought in the Battle of France. Stehlik he shot down four enemy aircraft solo and shared in shooting down four others.  In Britain  On 22 June 1940 France capitulated to Germany. Stehl√≠k and other Czechoslovak airmen were evacuated to the United Kingdom, where they were quickly enlisted in the RAF Volunteer Reserve. Stehl√≠k was re-trained to fly Hurricane Mk I fighter and given the rank of sergeant. He was posted to the newly-formed No. 312 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF, where he was allocated to Yellow Flight with Pilot Officer Alois Va≈°√°tko and led by Flight Lieutenant Denys Gillam. Stehl√≠k shot down Junkers Ju 88 bombers both in Britain and on the Eastern Front By October 1940 the squadron was stationed at RAF Speke outside Liverpool. About 16:00 hrs on 8 October a lone Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 88 medium bomber of Kampfgeschwader 2/806 was sighted flying up the River Mersey. Yellow Flight was scrambled, with Stehl√≠k flying Hurricane L1807. All three fighters machine-gunned the Ju 88, killing its observer and setting fire to its two engines. At 16:15 the bomber made a forced landing in a field near Bromborough Dock and the surviving crew were captured. On 14 March 1941 Stehl√≠k shot down a Ju 88 over the sea. In raids over German-occupied France he damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter and on 10 July 1941 probably shot down a Bf 109. In October 1941 Stehl√≠k was transferred from operation flying and trained at RAF Upavon to become a flying instructor. He was then posted to RAF Hullavington as an instructor. From January 1942 until February 1943 he served at Elementary and Secondary Flying Training Schools in Canada. In April 1943 Stehl√≠k returned to 312 Squadron, which had been re-equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire Mk VC. With 312 Squadron he flew several raids over occupied Europe.  On the Eastern Front  On the Eastern Front Stehl√≠k flew a Soviet-built Lavochkin La-5FN fighter Early in 1944 Stehl√≠k joined the 1st Czechoslovak independent fighter aviation regiment in the Soviet Union. He was commissioned as a nadporuchik (senior lieutenant) and commanded the regiment's 1st Squadron. From 15 September 1944 Stehl√≠k was based at Tri Duby airfield in central Slovakia, fighting in the Slovak National Uprising. Flying a Soviet- built Lavochkin La-5FN fighter he shot down a Ju 88 on 19 September and shared in shooting down a Junkers Ju 87 ground-attack aircraft on 7 October.  After the war  In post-war Czechoslovakia Stehl√≠k resumed his peacetime air force career. After the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat the Communist authorities politically purged him from the air force. He was held in prison for a year and stripped of his rank but acquitted and released for lack of evidence. By 1950 Stehl√≠k was working at Pozemn√≠ stavby in Brno in southern Moravia. In 1963 he became a driver and luggage porter at the Lipov√°-l√°znƒõ spa near Hrub√Ω Jesen√≠k in northern Moravia. In 1964 he was rehabilitated, his rank was restored and he returned to the air force. He retired as a colonel. Stehl√≠k died in Slaviƒç√≠n in eastern Moravia on 30 May 1991.  Achievements and honours  Stehl√≠k shot down 12 aircraft: five by himself and seven in collaboration with other airmen. He damaged one other aircraft and shared in probably shooting down another. He also destroyed two aircraft on the ground. = Awards = Stehl√≠k was decorated by Czechoslovakia, France, the UK and the USSR.

While multistable perception has been most commonly studied in the visual domain, it also has been observed in the auditory and olfactory modalities. In the olfactory domain, different scents are piped to the two nostrils, while in the auditory domain, researchers often examine the effects of binaural sequences of pure tones. Generally speaking, multistable perception has three main characteristics: exclusivity, implying that the multiple perceptions cannot simultaneously occur; randomness, indicating that the duration of perceptual phases follows a random law, and inevitability, meaning that subjects are unable to completely block out one percept indefinitely.  History  While binocular rivalry has been studied since the 16th century, the study of multistable auditory perception is relatively new.Blake, R. (2001). A Primer on Binocular Rivalry, Including Current Controversies. Brain and Mind, 2, 5-38 Diana Deutsch was the first to discover multistability in human auditory perception, in the form of auditory illusions involving periodically oscillating tones.Deutsch, D. (1974). An auditory illusion. Nature, 251, 307-309  Experimental Findings  Different experimental paradigms have since been used to study multistable perception in the auditory modality. One is auditory stream segregation, in which two different frequencies are presented in a temporal pattern. Listeners experience alternating percepts: one percept is of a single stream fluctuating between frequencies, and the alternative percept is of two separate streams repeating single frequencies each. Other experimental findings demonstrate the verbal transformation effect. In this paradigm, the input is a speech form repeated rapidly and continuously. The alternating percepts here are words‚Äîfor example, continuous repetition of the word ‚Äúlife‚Äù results in the bistability of ‚Äúlife‚Äù and ‚Äúfly.‚Äù Prefrontal activation is implicated with such fluctuations in percept, and not with changes in the physical stimulus, and there is also a possible inverse relationship between left inferior frontal and cingulate activation involved in this percept alternation.Sterzer, P. Kleinschimdt, A. & Rees, G. (2009). The neural bases of multistable perception. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Vol.13 No.7, 310-318  Principles of Perceptual Bistability  The temporal dynamics observed in auditory stream segregation are similar to those of bistable visual perception, suggesting that the mechanisms mediating multistable perception, the alternating dominance and suppression of multiple competing interpretations of ambiguous sensory input, might be shared across modalities. Pressnitzer and Hupe analyzed results of an auditory streaming experiment and demonstrated that the perceptual experience that occurred exhibited all three properties of multistable perception found in the visual modality‚Äîexclusivity, randomness, and inevitability.Pressnitzer, D. & Hupe, J. (2006). Temporal Dynamics of Auditory and Visual Bistability Reveal Common Principles of Organization. Current Biology, 16, 1351‚Äì1357 Exclusivity was satisfied, as there was ‚Äúspontaneous alternation between mutually exclusive percepts,‚Äù and very little time was spent in an ‚Äúindeterminate‚Äù experience. Randomness also characterized the phenomenon, as the first phase of perception is longer in duration than subsequent phases, and then the ‚Äústeady-state of the temporal dynamics of auditory streaming is purely stochastic with no long- term trend.‚Äù Lastly, the percept alternation was inevitable; even though volitional control did reduce suppression of the specified percept, it did not exclude perception of the alternative percept altogether. These similarities between perceptual bistability in the visual and auditory modalities raise the possibility of a common mechanism governing the phenomenon. In Pressnitzer and Hupe's subjects, the distributions of phase durations in the two modalities were not significantly different, and it has been speculated that the intraparietal sulcus, likely involved in crossmodal integration, could be responsible for bistability in both domains. However, the absence of subject- specific biases across the modalities contradicts the notion that a ‚Äúsingle top-down selection mechanism were the sole determinant of the auditory and visual bistability.‚Äù This observation, along with evidence of neural correlates at different stages of processing, instead suggests that competition is distributed and ‚Äúbased on adaptation and mutual inhibition, at multiple neural processing stages.‚Äù  Neural Correlates  = Place model = When using a two stream tone test, specific populations of neurons activate, known as the place model. Event related potential (ERP) amplitude increases when the difference of the frequency of the two tones increase. This model hypothesizes that when this is happening, the distance between the two populations of neurons increase, so that the two populations will interact less with each other, allowing for easier tone segregation. = fMRI results = FMRI has been used to measure the correlation between listening to alternating tones compared to single stream of tones. The posterior regions of the left auditory cortex were modulated by the alternating tones, indicating that there may be areas of the brains responsible for stream segregation.  Theoretical View  = Sequential grouping = A problem of large behavioral importance is the question of how to group auditory stimuli. When a continuous stream of auditory information is received, numerous alternative interpretations are possible, but individuals are only consciously aware of one percept at a time. For this to occur, the auditory system must segregate and group incoming sounds, the goal being to ‚Äúconstruct, modify, and maintain dynamic representations of putative objects within its environment‚Äù.Winkler, I. Denham, S. Mill. R, Bohm, T. & Bendixen, A. (2012). Multistability in auditory stream segregation: a predictive coding view. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society Biological Sciences, 367, 1001‚Äì1012 It has been suggested that this process of binding sound events into groups is driven by different levels of similarities. One principle for binding is based on the perceptual similarity between individual events. Sounds that share many or all of their acoustic features are more likely to have been emitted by the same source, and thus are more likely to be linked to form a ‚Äúproto-object‚Äù. The other principle for binding is based on the sequential predictability of sound events. If events reliably follow each other, it is also more likely that they have a common underlying cause. = Competition = A theory explaining the alternation of auditory percepts is that different interpretations are neurally represented simultaneously, but all but the dominant one at the time are suppressed. This idea of competition among parallel hypotheses might provide an explanation for the temporal dynamics observed in auditory stream segregation. The initial perceptual phase is held longer than the subsequent ones, ‚Äúwith the duration of the first phase being stimulus-parameter dependent and an order of magnitude longer in duration than parameter-independent subsequent phases‚Äù.Denham, S. Gyimesi, K. Stefanics, G. & Winkler, I. (2010). The Neurophysiological Bases of Auditory Perception, 477-487 At stimulus onset, the first percept might be that which is easiest to discover, based on featural proximity (and thus stimulus-parameter dependent), and it is held for relatively longer because time is required for other hypotheses to form. As more sensory information is received and processed, the ‚Äúneural associations underlying the alternative sound organizations become strong and start to vie for dominance‚Äù and ‚Äúthe probabilities of perceiving different organizations tend to become more balanced with time‚Äù  References  Auditory perception ","title":"Multistable auditory perception"},{"id":"42984422","text":"Jean Alfonsetti (born 10 January 1908, date of death unknown) was a Luxembourgian cyclist.

In 2014 she won the classic Oaks Stakes and went on to win Britain's premier weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. She subsequently finished second in the Yorkshire Oaks and third in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe before being retired at the end of the season. Background Taghrooda is a bay mare bred by her owner Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Stud. She is from the first crop of foals sired by Sea The Stars. Taghrooda's dam Ezima was a successful stayer who won four races including the Saval Beg Stakes. As a descendant of the broodmare Evisa, Ezima was closely related to the Ascot Gold Cup winners Enzeli and Estimate as well as the Irish Oaks winner Ebadiyla and a more distant relative of Darshaan, Sinndar, Acamas and Akiyda. Taghrooda's name is a reference to form of chanted poetry used by the Bedouins of Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The filly was sent into training with John Gosden at his Clarehaven Stable at Newmarket. Racing career =2013: two-year-old season= On her only appearance as a two-year-old, Taghrooda started a 20/1 outsider for a maiden race over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 21 September. Ridden by Dane O'Neill, she was towards the rear of the fourteen runner field in the early stages before making good progress to take the lead a furlong from the finish and won by a neck from the favourite Casual Smile. =2014: three-year-old season= On her first appearance of 2014, Taghrooda was ridden by Paul Hanagan and started favourite for the Listed Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket on 4 May. She took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew clear of her opponents in the closing stages to win by six lengths from Jordan Princess. After the race she was promoted to favouritism for The Oaks. Hanagan said \\"she gave me a lot of confidence, she's just got a bit about her. Stepping up to a mile and a half will be fine, she's very uncomplicated\\". The Racing Post described her performance as \\"breathtaking\\". On 6 June 2014, Taghrooda started the 5/1 third favourite, in a field of seventeen fillies, for the 236th running of the Oaks Stakes at Epsom Downs Racecourse. She raced just behind the leaders before moving into contention in the straight. She took the lead with two furlongs to run, went clear of the field and won by three and three quarter lengths from Tarfasha. The winning jockey Paul Hanagan said that the race \\"went like clockwork. I'd been planning it like that for about a month in my head\\". Taghrooda was expected to run next in the Irish Oaks at the Curragh Racecourse on 20 July and was ante-post favourite for the race. On 17 July, however, it was announced that the filly would be rerouted to contest Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 26 July. Hamdan Al Maktoum's racing manager Angus Gold said \\"I think Sheikh Hamdan wanted to give her a chance in the big one as she will be retiring at the end of this year... he just felt this filly is not going to have too many more races and deserved a chance\\". In the build-up to the Ascot race Gold issued another positive bulletin saying \\"Everything has gone very well with Taghrooda, she's been working very well and looks fantastic. She seems very happy in herself mentally\\". In the King George, ridden as usual by Hanagan, Taghrooda started the 7/2 second favourite behind Telescope in an eight-runner field which included Magician, Mukhadram and Trading Leather as well as her stable companions Eagle Top (King Edward VII Stakes) and Romsdal (third in The Derby). Hanagan restrained the filly towards the back of the field in the early stages, as Leitir Mor set a fast pace. She made steady progress approaching the final turn and made her challenge on the outside in the straight. Inside the final furlong Taghrooda overtook Telescope and Mukhadram, who had been battling for the lead, and accelerated clear to win by three lengths. She became the first British- trained three-year-old filly to win the race. She was also the first British- trained female winner since the four-year-old Time Charter in 1983 and the first three-year-old filly to succeed since the French-trained Pawneese in 1976. After the race Hanagan said \\"It‚Äôs amazing and that just caps it all off. The reception she is getting is just out of this world\\". Gosden commented \\"I think to go to the Irish Oaks off a win at Epsom would have been a defensive move and it was bold of [Hamdan Al Maktoum] and correct\\". Angus Gold said \\"She‚Äôs blessed with this extraordinary temperament, which very few fillies of that age have. She just never turns a hair\\". Taghrooda's next race was the Yorkshire Oaks over one and half miles at York Racecourse 21 August. Apparently facing much weaker opposition than in her previous race and started at odds of 1/5 against six opponents headed by Tapestry, an Aidan O'Brien- trained filly who had finished second in the Irish Oaks. Hanaghan settled the filly in fifth place before moving up on the turn into the straight and taking the lead approaching the final quarter mile. A furlong out, however, she was joined by Tapestry and after a prolonged struggle it was the Irish-trained filly who prevailed by a neck. After the race, Hanaghan said \\"I don't think there were many excuses, she was just beaten by a very good horse\\". On 5 October, Taghrooda started the 11/2 favourite for France's most prestigious race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse despite being given an unfavourable draw. She raced on the outside before making her challenge in the straight, staying on in the closing stages to finish third of the twenty runners, beaten two lengths and one and a quarter lengths by Treve and Flintshire. Eight days later it was announced that Taghrooda would be retired from racing to become a broodmare. Gold said \\"She has been wonderful and will be missed. In my time not since Salsabil have we had a filly this good, which shows how rare they are\\".Racing Post Breeding record Tahrooda's first foal, a filly sired by Kingman, was born in 2016. She is due to be covered by Muhaarar in 2017. Assessment and awards In November Taghrooda was named Champion Three-year-old Filly at the Cartier Racing Awards. In the 2014 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Taghrooda was rated the eighteenth best horse to race anywhere in the world in 2014 and was the top-rated three-year-old filly, three pounds ahead of Tapestry and four ahead of the American champion Untapable.

Koh purchased the subsidiary for $1 million, establishing the new company as Ademco (Far East) Pte Ltd. Koh set up a private alarm monitoring station enterprise for client facilities in Singapore. In the 1980s, the company installed alarms in elevators for the Housing and Development Board (HDB) to deter local crime.

Career Marshall is a founding member of the British folk band Mumford & Sons. He plays the banjo, bass guitar, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, dobro, and provides backing vocals. Marshall performed with two of his current band members, Marcus Mumford and Ted Dwane, in Laura Marling's band before Mumford & Sons. Before Mumford & Sons was established, Marshall ran a jam night at Bosun's Locker, a tiny music club beneath a pasty shop on the King's Road in Fulham, where a number of musicians who had an affinity for earthy acoustic music played with each other. Marshall was in a band prior to Mumford & Sons called Captain Kick and the Cowboy Ramblers, a bluegrass sleaze rap band, in which he was credited as Country Winston and played the banjo and guitar. In October 2013, Marshall joined a temporary supergroup called \\"Salvador Dal√≠ Parton\\" with fellow musicians Gill Landry of Old Crow Medicine Show, Mike Harris of Apache Relay, Jake Orrall of JEFF the Brotherhood, and Justin Hayward-Young of the Vaccines. The band, intended as a joke from the start, wrote six songs in 20 minutes on their first day together, held its one and only full-band rehearsal the next day, and performed six shows around Nashville, Tennessee, the following night before breaking up. In 2015, Marshall became interested in techno music and electronic dance music after spending several nights attending James Ford residency in a night club. In 2016, he joined the Austrian DJ duo HVOB for a collaboration; they recorded an album named Silk. Their first single, called \\"The Blame Game\\", was released in February 2017. The album was released on March 24. They toured across Europe and Asia, playing in festivals and night clubs while Winston was also performing in concerts with Mumford & Sons.

The Columbia Theatre was an American burlesque theatre on Seventh Avenue in New York, adjacent to Times Square, operated by the Columbia Amusement Company between 1910 and 1927. It specialized in \\"clean\\", family-oriented burlesque, similar to vaudeville. Many stars of the legitimate theater or of films were discovered at the Columbia. With loss of audiences to cinema and stock burlesque, the owners began to offer slightly more risqu√© material from 1925. The theater was closed in 1927, renovated and reopened in 1930 as a cinema called the Mayfair Theatre. It went through various subsequent changes and was later renamed the DeMille Theatre. Nothing is left of the interior. Building What would be called the \\"Home of Burlesque De Luxe\\" was built on the northeast corner of Seventh Avenue and 47th Street in Manhattan. A photograph from May 1909 before construction began shows the site was occupied by typical four- and five-story brownstone buildings. Construction by the Thompson‚ÄìStarrett Co. took seven months from the start of demolition to completion of the job. The building had ten stories above ground and was high. It held the headquarters of the Columbia Amusement Company, or Columbia Circuit, one of the largest of the burlesque circuits. The theater was designed by William H. McElfatrick and had a capacity of 1,385. It occupied the ground floors of the new office building. The decor was a form of Beaux Arts. There was a mural painted by Arthur Thomas above the proscenium arch called \\"The Goddesses of the Arts.\\" There were two balconies, as was common with theaters designed by McElfatrick. The theater was one of the first to have a ventilation system that partially cleaned the air of tobacco smoke. Opening The Columbia Amusement Company opened the Columbia Theatre on 10 January 1910. The opening was well publicized and was attended by various dignitaries. The opening was also attended by actors and managers from the worlds of vaudeville and legitimate theater. The Columbia Circuit was a leader in offering clean burlesque, family-style entertainment that resembled vaudeville. The main difference was that burlesque shows had an overall theme, a carry-over from the old minstrel show format, while vaudeville was a series of unconnected individual acts. The Columbia Theatre became the circuit's flagship, and has been called a \\"temple to clean burlesque\\". Despite this, not long after opening the Columbia was criticized because women in flesh-colored tights had appeared on stage. The critic George Jean Nathan was also unimpressed, but for the opposite reason. Writing of another theatre, he said, \\"Unlike the affectedly tony Columbia Theatre uptown, the Olympic remains true to first principles and devotes itself not, as in the case of the Columbia, to fifth-rate imitations of third-rate Broadway music shows, but to pure, unadulterated and heart-warming old knock 'em down and drag 'em out burlesque...\\" Shows Interior of the theater in 1910 Ceiling mural of \\"The Goddesses of the Arts\\" The musical comedy College Girl was staged at the Columbia in 1910. Fanny Brice was one of the stars, and was noticed by Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr.. He managed to get her freed of her contract so she could appear in the 1910 Follies. The theater's managers, Cliff Gordon and Robert North, decided to put on an adaptation of The Merry Whirl for the summer of 1911. The show had been on the road for several months. The Broadway version had \\"sixteen chorus girls, eight 'ponies' and four 'show' girls, also six chorus men to give them strength.\\" All wore elaborate costumes. Alexander's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin, sung by James C. Morton and Frank F. Moore, was the hit song of the show. Will Rogers appeared at the theatre, performing his rope tricks. Joe E. Brown, a comedian, was playing in the Columbia Theatre in 1918 when he was spotted by Henry Cort and offered a part in the successful Broadway show Listen, Lester. This launched Brown's career on the legitimate stage. Clark and McCullough, former vaudeville players, opened as burlesque stars in Puss Puss at the Columbia on 9 December 1918. In 1920 James E. Cooper produced Folly Town, a burlesque show that was one of the first racially integrated productions in New York. A clean burlesque, it featured the colored Tennessee Ten with Florence Mills and the comedians Bert Lahr and Jack Haley. It cost over $20,000 to produce, a huge amount for that period, and opened at the Columbia Theatre. The show received enthusiastic reviews. In June 1920 the Burlesque Club held its annual benefit at the Columbia Theatre, again featuring the Tennessee Ten. Jimmie Cooper's Revue, with white and colored casts, opened at the Columbia on 10 December 1923. The white players performed in part 1, and the colored players in part 2. A reviewer said of the second part, \\"We have never seen anything as yet in burlesque to equal the act of these performers, individually or collectively. Furthermore, it was the best dressed colored act that we have seen on any stage. Each and every turn was well applauded. Will Rogers performed at the theatre in the Red Pepper Review, a tribute to the Columbia Burlesque Circuit, on 8 January 1925. An African-American troupe opened at the Columbia in July 1925, including a jazz band featuring the clarinetist Sidney Bechet. Other players were Jerome Don Pasquall and Wellman Braud. Lucky Sambo (1925) was another production with an African-American cast that was popular with white audiences. By the mid-1920s cinemas were providing shows that combined film and live entertainment with ticket prices lower than any burlesque show. In the 1925 season Columbia's president, Sam A. Scribner, authorized the removal of tights and display of tableaux of bare-breasted women. Columbia continued to lose customers to other types of entertainment and to more explicit stock burlesque theaters. The Columbia Theatre closed in 1927. Later history The theater was sold to Walter Reade in 1928 for conversion into a cinema. The architect Thomas W. Lamb replaced the two original balconies with a single balcony, and renovated the auditorium in Art Deco style. In October 1930 the cinema opened as the Mayfair Theatre, operated by RKO Pictures. Brandt Theatres was running the theater by 1950. In the early 1960s it was renamed the DeMille Theatre, and became a venue for viewing premium 70mm films with reserved seating. In 1976 the theater was split into three separate and very narrow cinemas, and was known as the Embassy 2-3-4 Theatre until 1997, and then the Embassy 1-2-3 Theatre until finally closing in the early 2000s. In 2007 the theater was converted into a restaurant. By May 2013 this had also closed. The theater had been completely gutted so that demolition could start.

Invasion of Grenada On 13 March 1979 the People's Revolutionary Army, led by Maurice Bishop, overthrew the newly independent government of the small island of Grenada and established a new regime based on socialist principles. This brought it into continuing conflict with the United States, as the administration of U.S. President Reagan considered the leftist government to be too closely allied to Cuba and the Soviet Union. On 12 October 1983 a hard-line faction of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Government of Grenada, controlled by former Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard, took control of the government from Bishop and placed him under house arrest. Within days, Bishop and many of his supporters were dead, and the nation had been placed under martial law. The severity of the violence, coupled with Coard's hard-line Marxism, caused deep concern among neighboring Caribbean nations, as well as in Washington, D.C. Adding to the U.S.' concern was the presence of nearly 1,000 American medical students in Grenada. On 25 October, the United States invaded Grenada, an operation codenamed Operation Urgent Fury. The invasion plan involved mixing conventional and special forces in a coordinated, surprise coup de main assault. SEAL Team Six was assigned three pre-invasion missions: two clandestine political missions relating to regime change on the island, and a reconnaissance from the sea of the new airfield under construction on the island's southwest coast. There was almost no intelligence for these operations. On Oct. 23, SEAL Team Six's Assault Group Three began the airport recon with a static line parachute drop, along with two combat-raiding small craft, well beyond detection by the Grenadian military. A rain squall accompanied by high winds broke out just before the SEALs conducted the water- drop rendezvous with the USS Clifton Sprague. One of two C-130 cargo planes transporting the SEALs to their drop point veered off course. Four SEALs drowned upon landing in the dark while carrying a full assortment of weapons, ammunition and combat equipment. Kenneth J. Butcher, Kevin E. Lundberg, Stephen L. Morris and Robert R. Schamberger were never seen again. The surviving SEAL jumpers were taken aboard the Navy frigate where they were joined by other waiting SEALs and an Air Force combat control team. After an unsuccessful search for the missing men, this 20-man group attempted to complete their delayed mission. Their open boats swamped while evading a suspected patrol boat, causing the mission to be aborted. A second attempt was made the next night, but it was also unsuccessful. In the end, the airport reconnaissance was successfully performed three hours before H-Hour on D-Day by an Air Force AC-130. The two SEAL Team Six regime-change missions both involved Governor General Sir Paul Scoon, the Anglofile, Grenadian-born, appointed head-of-state. The principal mission was to fly to the governor general's mansion in the capital city, secure him, his wife and his staff and them move them all out of the combat area. The second, simultaneous regime- change mission was to capture and secure Grenada's long-distance radio transmitter station, located seven miles north of the capital city. The station was to be held until Scoon could broadcast a message to his county and the Caribbean, declaring that the intervention was both legal and desired. In the event, that D-Day message was delayed by events for three days. The two SEAL regime-change missions were coordinated with a third, a prison assault assigned to Delta Force and Army Rangers. A mixed-service force of commandos departed behind schedule from Barbados in 9 Army transport helicopters at 0500 on D-Day October 25., By the time the UH-60 Black Hawks arrived over Grenadian soil, U.S. Marines had already landed on the east coast of the island and overt combat was underway. Marines waved as the late-arriving Black Hawks passed overhead. = Governor-General's mansion = Two Black Hawks carried two SEAL platoons to the two-story, Georgian-style building overlooking Grenada's capital city where Scoon lived and worked. Twenty-two SEALs fast- roped to the ground while under heavy enemy fire. The opposing fire damaged one of the helicopters and seriously wounded an Army flight commander. The stricken Black Hawk flew out to Navy ships offshore, also carrying away the SEAL's commanding officer and their portable satellite radio. Meanwhile, the assault team approached from the back of the mansion. The SEALs found Scoon and 10 other civilians hiding in the basement. The SEALs then continued to clear the rest of the house and began to set up a defensive perimeter to ensure security. Soon the mansion started to take fire from enemy soldiers armed with AK-47s and RPGs. As the incoming fire started to increase, Scoon and his party were moved to a safer location in the house. After the incoming fire had decreased, three men wearing Cuban-made uniforms approached the mansion, all of them carrying AK-47s. The SEALs shouted for the three men to stop where they were. When the three men heard the yells, they raised their weapons. The SEALs opened fire on the trio and killed them almost instantly. The SEALs suspected the men were Cubans, but the post-invasion evidence strongly indicates they were Grenadians. Soon afterward, two BTR-60s rolled up to the mansion's gates. One of the BTRs at the mansion's front gate opened fire. Just as the SEALs were about to fire a M-72 LAW anti-tank rocket, the BTR backed off and left with the other BTR. The vehicles were chased off by two protective AC-130s. The only communications the team had were through limited-range MX-360 radios. The team used these hand-held radios to communicate with a SEAL command post on the island to call in air strikes. As the radios' batteries started to fade, communications with the SEAL command post became weak. Once all the radios had died, when the SEALs urgently needed air support, they used a regular house phone to call JSOC, which was able to get an AC-130H Spectre gunship to hold station over the SEALs' position to provide air support. When morning came, Marines from Company G of Battalion Landing Team 2/8 arrived to relieve the SEALs. The Governor General and his wife were evacuated to the USS Guam, the invasion force flagship, by Marine helicopter. =Radio station= A Soviet-made BTR-60PB armored personnel carrier seized by U.S. forces during Operation Urgent Fury While Scoon was being secured, 12 other operators from SEAL Team Six, under the command of Lt. Donald ‚ÄúKim‚Äù Erskine, flew on to the radio station in a lone Black Hawk helicopter. The helicopter took small-arms fire on the insertion. Once the team landed, it quickly overran the radio station compound and took enemy prisoners. The SEALs were told to hold the station until Governor Scoon and a broadcast team could be brought in. After the team took control of the compound, it was not able to make radio contact with the SEAL command post. The SEALs set up a defensive perimeter while they continued to try to make radio contact. As this was happening, a truck with armed Grenadian soldiers arrived at the station. The SEALs ordered the soldiers to drop the weapons. After a brief tense standoff, the soldiers opened fire, but they were quickly neutralized. All the soldiers were killed or wounded by the SEALs. The SEALs continued trying to make radio contact. Then a BTR-60 and three trucks, carrying a dozen soldiers each, were spotted coming towards the station. The soldiers flanked the building and the BTR covered the front entrance with its 14.5 mm KPV heavy machine gun. The incoming fire on the SEALs' position was becoming devastatingly heavy, and they were running out of ammunition. The SEALs were engaged with a numerically superior enemy force. The team realized that their only option was to change their original plan of holding the radio station, and instead disable the radio transmitter, then extract towards the water. They followed a pre-planned escape route out behind the station and across a broad meadow that led to a path that cut between cliffs and a beach. The meadow was exposed to Grenadian fire. The team leapfrogged across the exposed ground and took heavy fire suffering several wounded. Finally reaching the end of the field, cut through a chain-link fence, ran into dense brush, and followed the path to the beach. The Grenadians were still in pursuit, so the SEALs waded into the water and began swimming parallel to the shore until they found cliff ledges in which to hide/ Once the Grenadians had given up the search they swam out to sea. They were in the water for nearly six hours until a rescue plane spotted them and vectored the USS Caron, a destroyer, to pick them up. The officer in charge, Erskine, was wounded in the arm during the operation and was awarded the Purple Heart and Silver Star for heroism and leadership in commanding the assault element. Three other SEAL Team SIX members were wounded during the operation. Achille Lauro Hijacking On October 7, 1985 an Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro carrying 400 passengers including American citizens was hijacked by Palestinian terrorists led by Mohammed Abul al-Abbas also known as Muhammad Zaidan. The ship was hijacked in the Mediterranean sea and forced to sail to Southern Syria. President Ronald Reagan approved deployment of Navy's SEAL Team SIX and Delta Force operators to plan and prepare for a rescue attempt to free the vessel from its hijackers. On October 8, Syria refused permission for the ship to dock and subsequently the hijackers murdered Leon Klinghoffer, an elderly Jewish American businessman. The ship then sailed towards Port Said, Egypt. On October 9, SEAL Team SIX assault members embarked on board the USS Iwo Jima LPH-2 which steamed for Port Said. On October 10, the four terrorist hijackers boarded an Egypt Air Boeing 737 airliner and flew from Cairo and headed for Tunisia. President Reagan approved military plans to intercept the aircraft over the Mediterranean Sea. Navy F-14 Tomcat fighters located the airliner south of Crete and forced the pilots to land at NAS Sigonella, the NATO air base in Sicily. After the 737 touched down, two United States Air Force C-141 Starlifter cargo planes landed with SEAL Team SIX who quickly surrounded the airplane but were then surrounded by Italian Carabinieri. The plane came to a stop on the Italian controlled portion at Sigonella and therefore was on Italian Soil. As the SEALs prepared to assault the airplane, negotiations between the United States, Egyptian and Italian authorities continued. The four hijackers were eventually taken off the plane into the custody of the Italians without further escalation of hostilities. Panama During Operation Just Cause in Panama, Special Operations Forces consisted of five unconventional task forces; GREEN (Army Delta Force), BLACK (3d Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group), RED (75th Ranger Regiment), BLUE (DEVGRU), and WHITE (Navy Sea-Air-Land, or SEAL Teams 4 and 2). DEVGRU's primary task, along with Delta Force, was locating and securing of Panamanian ruler General Manuel Noriega. Specific details of DEVGRU's involvement still remain classified. Somalia During Operation Gothic Serpent in Somalia, DEVGRU was a part of Task Force Ranger. TF Ranger was made up of operators from Delta Force, the 75th Ranger Regiment, the 160th SOAR, the 24th Special Tactics Squadron, and SEALs from DEVGRU. Eric T. Olson, John Gay, Howard Wasdin, Homer Nearpass and Richard Kaiser were the five SEALs that fought in the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu during the last mission of Operation Gothic Serpent to capture the warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. Olson would receive the Silver Star for his actions which were cited as \\"... during combat actions in Mogadishu, Somalia, in October 1993. While under withering enemy fire during actions in support of UNOSOM II operations, Captain Olson demonstrated a complete disregard for his own personal safety in the accomplishment of his mission\\". Olson became commander of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group one year later. Mali In 2017, SEAL Team Six was deployed to Mali to support French and Malian counter-terrorism operations against al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and other terrorist cells. NATO intervention in Bosnia, 1993‚Äì99 During NATO's intervention in the Bosnian War, the NSWDG operated alongside other members of NATO's Implementation Force, such as its Army counterpart Delta Force and the British SAS. These units were tasked with finding and apprehending persons indicted for war crimes (PIFWC) and returning them to The Hague to stand trial. Some of DEVGRU's PIFWC operations under team leader William Waddell included apprehending Goran Jelisiƒá, Simo Zaric, Milan Simic, Miroslav Tadic, and Radislav Krstiƒá. War in Afghanistan =Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Afghanistan= SEAL Team Six during 2002 assassination attempt on Afghan President Hamid Karzai In Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), U.S. Special Operations forces played a central role in the fighting. It was also here they began to specialize in counter- terrorist tactics and information. During the coalition invasion of Afghanistan a squadron from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Sword (later renamed Task Force 11 in January 2002), which was established in early October 2001. it was a black SOF unit under direct command of JSOC. This was a so- called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was of capturing or killing senior leadership and HVT within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. As part of Task Force Bowie, SEALS from DEVGRU were part of the AFOs ‚Äì a 45-man reconnaissance unit made up of a Delta Force recce specialists augmented by selected SEALs from DEVGRU and supported by ISA's technical experts. The AFOs had been raised to support TF Sword and were tasked with intelligence preparation of the battlefield, working closely with the CIA and reported directly to TF Sword. AFO conducted covert reconnaissance ‚Äì sending small 2 or 3 man teams into al-Qaeda 'Backyard' along the border with Pakistan, the AFO operators would deploy observation posts to watch and report enemy movements and numbers as well as environmental reconnaissance; much of the work was done on foot or ATVs.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.29‚Äì31,p.231 On February 28, 2002, on the eve of the Operation Anaconda, three AFO teams were infiltrated into the Shahikot Valley, one of them (known as Mako 31) was composed of three SEALs from DEVGRUs Recce Squadron, a USAF Combat controller and a US Navy EOD operator. They infiltrated the area on foot via the southern edge of the valley to set up an observation post on a terrain feature known as 'The Finger.' All three teams were tasked with confirming enemy strengths and dispositions including antiaircraft emplacements, ensuring the designated Rakkasan HLZs were clear of obstructions and providing terminal guidance for air support both prior to and during the insertion of conventional forces.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.54 Near H-Hour on March 1, 2002, Mako 31 found a group of foreign fighters had an established positioned and were manning a DShK HMG on the peak where they planned to set up an observation post. If the DShK was not disabled before then, it could shoot down Chinooks carrying the conventional forces. The SEALs therefore planned to ambush the terrorists in the pre-dawn darkness before the Rakkasans flew into the valley. However, they were spotted by an Uzbek insurgent and a brief firefight ensued, killing 5 out of 7 foreign fighters, as another insurgent firing a PKM, the team broke contact and brought in an AC-130 which destroyed the enemy encampment with 105 mm rounds. During the crucial Battle of Takur Ghar part of Operation Anaconda a small team of DEVGRU assigned to an AFO task force was tasked with establishing observation positions (OPs) on the high ground above the proposed landing zones of U.S. conventional forces. It was one of the most violent battles of Operation Anaconda. In the early hours of March 4, 2002 a MH-47E Chinook helicopter piloted by the U.S. Army's 160th SOAR \\"Nightstalkers\\" was carrying Mako 21 and Mako 30 teams mostly made up of SEALs from DEVGRU. The original plan was that MAKO 21 would to link up with AFO team Juliet at the northern end of the valley, resupply it and then establish a hide site/observation post on the eastern ridge above Task Force Rakkasan's blocking position; whilst MAKO 30 planned to establish an observation point on the peak of Takur Ghar, which commanded a view of the Shahi-Kot valley. Mako 30 would be inserted at a point east of the peak, but circumstances led the SEALs to choose the summit of Takur Ghar itself as the insertion point. As the helicopter was nearing its landing zone both the pilots and the men in the back observed fresh tracks in the snow, goatskins, and other signs of recent human activity. As the pilots and team discussed a mission abort, an RPG struck the side of the aircraft, wounding one crewman as machine gun bullets ripped through the fuselage, cutting hydraulic and oil lines. Fluid spewed about the ramp area of the helicopter. As the pilot struggled to get the helicopter away Neil C. Roberts, a DEVGRU SEAL in the ramp area of the aircraft, was hit and slipped on the oil as the helicopter took off. He fell approximately to the snowy ground below. Roberts immediately engaged enemy forces with his weapons including an Mk.46 Mod 0 Light Machine Gun, SIG Sauer P226 Mk.25 Mod 0 9 mm semi automatic pistol and grenades. He survived at least 30 minutes before he was shot and killed at close range. Mako 30 was inserted in an attempt to recover Roberts, the ran into a bunker housing 3 al-Qaeda fighters and killed them, then were engaged in a 20-minute firefight and suffered several wounded, forcing them to break contact and call for a QRF. USAF Technical Sergeant John Chapman, a Combat Controller with the 24th Special Tactics Squadron, was mistakenly left behind by the SEALs. Chapman fought alone, killing enemy fighters with scrounged weapons and in hand-to- hand combat. He was finally killed while providing covering fire to distract Taliban fighters from an approaching rescue helicopter. For his actions, Chapman earned the Medal of Honor. On 17 March 2002, in the final days of Operation Anaconda, operators from DEVGRU (commanded by the SEAL who led the Mako 30 mission on Takur Ghar), with an attached British SBS operator, intercepted a convoy of al-Qaeda fighters travelling in 3 SUVs via 3 MH-47E Chinooks, with a mixed force of U.S. Army Rangers travelling in MH-60K Blackhawk helicopters as back up. After an ensuing firefight, 16 al-Qaeda fighters were killed and 2 seriously wounded were captured.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.67-69P.32 On September 5, 2002, DEVGRU operators protected President Hamid Karzai during an assassination attempt in Kandahar. Allegedly one of their members was wounded In 2003, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was arrested in a joint CIA and ISI operation in Pakistan and had to be flown out to a US Black site prison. Companies from the US Army Rangers and 82nd Airborne Division secured an improvised desert strip in a dry river bed near the Pakistani border, an MC-130H Combat Talon II plane landed and lowered its ramp. SEALs from DEVGRU appeared in Desert Patrol Vehicles carrying the detainee arrived and drove up the ramp into the back of the plane, which then taxied and lifted off.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.231-232 In September 2005, a British security contractor was kidnapped by Taliban insurgents in Farah Province, JSOC managed to locate the hostage and insurgents in a mountainous region of Bala Buluk. A DEVGRU team arrived in an early morning raid, but the Taliban murdered the hostage.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.236 In July 2006, a pair of MH-47Es from 160th SOAR attempted to insert a combined strike element of DEVGRU, Rangers and Afghan commandos in Helmand Province so it could attack a target compound. With some troops on the ground, a large insurgent force ambushed them, both helicopters were struck by small arms fire, one MH-47E pilot put his aircraft directly in the line of fire protecting the other MH-47E whose assault team it was carrying was still disembarking. Inevitably the MH-47E was hit by an RPG which caused it to crash-land, the skill of the Nightstalker pilots saved the operators and the aircrew, no one was seriously wounded in the crash. The Ranger commander and an attached Australian Commando organised an all-round defence while the other MH-47E held back the advancing insurgents until its miniguns ran out of ammunition, an AC-130 Spectre joined the battle and kept the down crew and passengers safe until a British Immediate Response Team helicopter successfully recovered them, the AC-130 then destroyed the MH-47E wreck ‚Äì denying it to the Taliban.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.232-233, p.236-237 In 2007, a CIA source reported seeing Bin Laden in Tora Bora, a significant proportion of the ISR assets available in the theatre converged on the area, the initial plan based around a small helicopter assault force soon expanded to include U.S. Army Special Forces Green Beret ODAs and a Ranger element to provide a cordon for the SEALs. Eventually the operation was launched under the cover of Air Force bombing, but after fruitless searching through the mountains, there was no sign of him. In June 2009, US Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban, over the 5 years that he was held by the Taliban and Haqqani Network, DEVGRU and Rangers \\"spun up\\" operations to rescue him, but each resulted in a \\"dry hole\\". One such operation carried out south of Kabul in July 2009 resulted in one SEAL seriously wounded and a combat assault dog killed.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.277 Raid in Kunar, August 2009 After the mission in an unsuccessful attempt at rescuing Bowe Bergdahl which had a DEVGRU operative wounded and a combat assault dog killed. DEVGRU was prepared for another operation. This operation was to conduct a raid on a couple of compounds in Kunar to eliminate Taliban fighters and then withdraw back to base after completing their objective. So two teams of SEALs were formed to infiltrate through terrain that was thought impassible. Since there was the possibility of enemy lookouts watching out for American forces moving out on the trail away from their base. The army of the U.S. armed forces would patrol together with the two teams of Navy Seals when leaving their base. After the combined army and SEAL patrol traveled some distance, the Navy Seals would break off from the patrol and sneak off unseen while the larger army formation would keep on traveling as bait/distraction for the possible enemy lookouts to spy on. The two teams of SEALs traveled through their infiltration route and finally made it to the target compounds. With the element of surprise, the SEALs with mostly with sound suppressed carbines, a few light machine guns, and some sniper rifles struck with perfect precision and killed all seventeen Taliban fighters that were occupying the compounds with not a single casualty inflicted on the SEALs. The SEALs then successfully conducted SSE at the target compounds. Taliban reinforcements were arriving some distance away in increasing numbers. So the SEALs destroyed all the enemy weapons and ammunition they found with timed explosives. Then the SEALs withdrew safely back to base a long distance while an AC-130 gunship provided air cover bombarding the incoming Taliban reinforcements which may have killed an estimated seven or eight more Taliban fighters. After arriving back at base, the SEALs handed over all the intelligence gathered from their SSE to the army captain.\\"No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden\\" by Mark Owen pg. 121-137. Death of Linda Norgrove, 8 October 2010 Linda Norgrove, a British aid worker, and three Afghan colleagues were kidnapped by members of the Taliban in Kunar Province, eastern Afghanistan, on 26 September 2010. The three Afghan aid workers were released on 3 October 2010 while negotiations over Norgrove's release were ongoing. Signal intercepts and aerial ISR assets found Nosgrove in one of two Taliban hillside compounds in Korangal Valley and guarded by at least 6 insurgents. A troop from DEVGRU Silver squadron and two squads of U.S. Army Rangers of the 75th Ranger Regiment conducted a rescue attempt on at 0300 on 8 October 2010. A pair of Boeing MH-47E Chinooks covered by an Lockheed Martin AC-130U Spooky II Gunship and an armed MQ-1B Predator UAV, would have to insert the DEVGRU team directly on top of the target compound, due to the rocky terrain and lack of cover, the Rangers were inserted nearby to establish blocking positions and fire support positions overlooking the compound. The lead MH-47E arrived over the compound and the SEALs quickly fast roped to the ground, snipers from the second helicopter engaged and killed two guards with suppressed HK417, as the SEALs landed in the compound insurgents appeared from several small buildings and were immediately engaged, two were killed by an orbiting AC-130. The SEALs were then fired upon by an insurgent coming out of one of the buildings, fire was returned and the insurgent was killed, unknown to the SEALs the insurgent was dragging the hostage out of the building at the time and she received a gunshot wound to the leg, fearing more insurgents were in an area between two buildings, a SEAL operator threw a fragmentation grenade toward the area. The SEALs cleared the buildings, confirming all six insurgents killed, Nosgrove was found fatally wounded, initially it was thought she had been killed by an insurgent suicide bomb, only later did it emerge that the cause of her death was probably the SEAL grenade. In the after action reviews, the SEAL who threw the grenade did not admit to throwing it, until helmet camera footage was reviewed by the squadron commander, three operators were dismissed from the unit.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.263-265 Afghanistan helicopter crash, 6 August 2011 Fifteen members of DEVGRU's Gold Squadron \\"Golden Knights\\" were among the 38 killed on Saturday, 6 August 2011 in Maidan Wardak province, Afghanistan, when a Boeing CH-47D Chinook helicopter flown by B Company, 7th Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment, was shot down by a Taliban-fired rocket-propelled grenade; the crash wiped out an entire troop. The personnel killed in the helicopter crash are said to have belonged to an \\"immediate reaction force\\" that were en route to intercept a group of Taliban who were escaping the area following an operation by United States Army Rangers.SEAL Team 6 members among 38 killed in Afghanistan. Los Angeles Times 6 August 2011.Helicopter Crash in Afghanistan Reportedly Kills Members of SEAL Team 6. Fox News, 6 August 2011.NATO Crash: Communities Mourn Loss of Troops Killed in Afghanistan. ABC News, 6 August 2011. It was the largest single loss of U.S. life since the beginning of the 2001 Afghan War, and is the largest single loss ever suffered by the SEALs. Operation Jubilee On 22 May 2012, British aid worker Helen Johnston, a Kenyan NGO worker and two Afghan guides were captured and held captive by bandits in Badakhshan Province, Afghanistan. The bandits offered their release in exchange for a ransom that included the release of a notorious drug dealer; with the threat that the kidnappers may sell on the hostages to the Taliban (with whom they had already been in contact), coalition forces worked around the clock to locate them. Signal intercept teams got a fix on the kidnappers location, high altitude UAVs began constant pattern of life surveillance in an effort to establish exactly where the hostages being held, the number of kidnappers and their daily routes as well as approach routes for the SOF rescue teams. It was soon established that the hostages had been split up and were being held in two separate caves in the Koh-e-Laram forest, a joint British-US hostage rescue mission was planned. On 28 May 2012, the operation was carried out: two teams ‚Äì one from the British Army 22nd Special Air Service Regiment ( SAS ) and one from U.S. Naval Special Warfare DEVGRU ‚Äì were inserted by U.S. Army 160th SOAR \\"Nightstalker\\" Sikorsky MH-60M Blackhawk helicopters at an LZ 2 km from the target location, then the assault force advanced on foot through the forest and established a security cordon before assaulting into the caves simultaneous. The SEALs assaulted and cleared one cave killing seven gunmen but didn't find any hostages. The SAS team assault on the other cave killed a further four gunmen and rescued all four hostages, none of the hostages or operators were harmed.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.265-266 Rescue of Dr. Dilip Joseph, 8 December 2012 On 8 December 2012, DEVGRU rescued Dilip Joseph, an American doctor held captive by the Taliban in Eastern Afghanistan. Dr. Joseph, who was working for an aid organization, was kidnapped along with two Afghan colleagues at a road block by armed men and were moved to a compound in Laghma Province. The two Afghans were later released after negotiations. When intelligence indicated Dr. Joseph was in imminent danger a rescue operation was mounted. During the operation, seven of his Taliban captors were killed and two Taliban captured according to sources in the news and other articles. A DEVGRU member involved in the rescue, Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Nicolas Checque, was also killed. Checque was a highly decorated combat veteran awarded with the Bronze Star Medal with Valor and the Purple Heart as well as the Navy Cross posthumously awarded following the mission, among many others.Qadir Sediqi,\\"U.S. Navy SEAL killed in operation to rescue American doctor in Afghanistan\\" CNN 10 December 2012 Senior Chief Naval Special Warfare Operator Edward C. Byers received the Medal of Honor on February 29, 2016, for his actions during the rescue.Navy SEAL receives Medal of Honor Retrieved 2016-03-01. Byers was the second SEAL through the door moving into position within the room where Joseph was being held and immediately engaged an enemy fighter, he then saw an unidentified individual moving across the floor in which he tackled them pinning him to the ground, once identified as another enemy fighter he was engaged by Byers. After hearing a response back from Dilip Joseph identifying his position Byers covered Joseph with his own body while also holding another armed enemy fighter close by to a wall by the throat until teammates could dispatch the enemy. =Operation Freedom's Sentinel= By the end of 2014, U.S. and NATO forces withdrew from Afghanistan-concluding Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan, the following year, US operations within Afghanistan continued under the codename: Operation Freedom's Sentinel. Attempted rescue of American and Australian hostages in Afghanistan, August 2016 On August 7, 2016, an American and an Australian professor working at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul, were kidnapped; CNN reported that a few days later operators from SEAL Team Six attempted to rescue them. The operators parachuted (HALO jump) into Afghanistan, but failed to find them at the location they searched, however, the BBC reported that there were no US service personnel or civilians were harmed and a number of \\"hostile forces\\" were killed. The US was never certain the professors were at the site, or if they were, when they had been moved. Some electronic media was recovered indicating the identities of those who were holding them. =Personnel recovery from aircraft crash site= DEVGRU was also involved in the recovery of US personnel killed when a US Bombardier E-11A jet which crashed in mountainous territory in eastern Afghanistan, January 27, 2020.https://www.newsweek.com/navy-seals-recover-two-bodies-us-plane-wreckage- taliban-held-territory-1484412 Operation Iraqi Freedom During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, at the start of the Iraq War, a squadron from DEVGRU operated as part of Task Force 20, their role was to conduct heliborne direct action raids - particularly against HVTs On the evening of March 26, 2003, a DEVGRU assault element supported by B Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment at a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre - codenamed Objective Beaver - that intelligence indicated that chemical and biological weapons stocks may have been located along the shore of the al Qadisiyah reservoir among government and residential buildings, assaulted the complex (codenamed Objective Beaver). Whilst the first of four MH-60Ks inserted the Rangers into their blocking positions, it was engaged by small arms fire from a nearby building, an AH-6M spotted the muzzle flashes and fired a 2.75inch rocket into the location silencing the small arms fire, the second MH-60K was also struck by small arms fire but its door gunner suppressed it. USAF A-10A Thunderbolt II \\"Warthogs\\" engaged nearby electricity transformers successfully blacking out the area, but it resulted in a series of explosions and a resulting fire at the stations that dramatically lit the sky - pinpointing the orbiting helicopters from enemy gunmen. Small arms fire increased as the final two MH-60s inserted their blocking teams, the two pairs of AH-6M Little Birds and MH-60L Direct Action Penetrator Blackhawks, supporting the mission continued to suppress targets as the four MH-47E Chinooks carrying the DEVGRU main assault force inserted under heavy enemy small arms fire whilst DEVGRU sniper teams aboard a pair of MH-6M Little Birds engaged numerous gunmen and vehicles. The SEALs conducted a hasty SSE while the Ranger blocking positions received and returned fire, the AH-6Ms and the aerial snipers continued to engage enemy gunmen whilst the DAPs pushed further out to ensure no reinforcements approached - engaging and destroying numerous Fedayeen armed technicals. The SSE took longer than expected owing to the size and maze-like structure of the building, the mission completed after 45 minutes, later tests of the material recovered by DEVGRU showed no evidence of chemical or biological weapons at the Objective Beaver, one Nightstalker crew from an MH-47E and one Ranger was wounded.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.133-134 On April 1, 2003, around 60 SEALs from DEVGRU successfully rescued PFC Jessica Lynch from a hospital in An'Nasiriyah.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.131-132 During the occupation, they were stationed at Al Asad Airbase as part of Task Force West/Blue. In 2005, DEVGRU along with Delta force and other regular Army and Marine forces took part in Operation Snake Eyes: an operation aimed at taking down local militant networks, especially against Al-Qaeda in Iraq, eliminating the groups from top to bottom, with particular focus on the \\"middle men\\". The operation took place all across Iraq, raids were synchronised with ground-holding regular Army and Marine forces;Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 , p.71,p.80-81 when Delta Force took a number of casualties during that year, at least 3 DEVGRU Operators who were deployed to Afghanistan were seconded to Delta after they requested additional assaulters.Owen, Mark No Easy Day: The Autobiography of a Navy Seal: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden, DUTTON Books, 2012 , p.46 During the Second Battle of Ramadi, DEVGRU operators from Task Force Blue and Delta Force operators from Task Force Green mounted take down operations against al-Qaeda targets based on high-level intelligence.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.180 In December 2006, DEVGRU operators were carrying out missions in Western Iraq: working along the border with Syria and in Ar'Ramadi, targeting high-level couriers that brought in foreign fighters and Iranian weapons and also assisting US Marines in clearing and securing series of houses near the Syrian border.Owen, Mark No Easy Day: The Autobiography of a Navy Seal: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden, DUTTON Books, 2012 , p.67-68 Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Horn of Africa As part of OEF-HOA, Naval Special Warfare Unit 10 are deployed to Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, under the command of SOCCE-HOA (Special Operations Command and Control Element-Horn of Africa) which commands all SOCOM units assigned to training or operational missions in the region. Special operations carried out in Somalia are conducted under the codename: Operation Octave Dune, as part of the overall effort in Somalia, which is known as Operation Octave Shield.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.200-201 Before Djibouti became the epicentre for counter terrorism operations in Africa, unilateral operations were launched from temporary forward locations in friendly nations such as Kenya, or from US Navy Ships.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.282 Operation Celestial Balance is one example of such a mission: the target was the member of the east African al-Qaeda cell responsible for the 1998 United States embassy bombings and he was involved in bombing of a Kenyan hotel resort, he was the facilitator between al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab. After collecting information on the target and his location, CIA and JSOC planners presented President Obama with 4 options: a Tomahawk cruise missile strike, an airstrike, an attack by Little Bird helicopters or an attempt to capture the target with an assault force of SEALs. Obama picked the airstrike option, however on the day of the operation a USMC Boeing AV-8B Harrier II+ approached its release point it reported a malfunction in its targeting system; so 8 helicopters (4 AH-6M Little Birds and 4 MH-60L Blackhawks) were sent in, piloted by members of the 160th SOAR \\"Nightstalkers\\" carrying a team of SEAL Operators from DEVGRU. The AH-6s strafed the two-vehicle convoy, killing the target and 3 Al'Shabaab terrorists, the MH-60s dropped off the DEVGRU operators who cleared the vehicles and recovered the body.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.282-284 In preparation for the Bulo Marer hostage rescue attempt, a small team of Operators from Red Squadron DEVGRU, trained with operators from the DGSE Action Division who carried out the rescue attempt.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.294 =Maersk Alabama hijacking and rescue, 12 April 2009= MV Maersk Alabama, a 508 foot long cargo ship carrying 17,000 tons of humanitarian aid supplies, was seized by pirates 240 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia, in waters notorious for piracy. After a confrontation with the crew, four of the hijackers fled in the ship's lifeboat, taking Captain Richard Phillips with them as hostage and resulting in a stand-off with a group US Navy warships including, USS Bainbridge DDG-96, USS Halyburton FFG-40, and USS Boxer LHD-4. DEVGRU operators flew non-stop from Virginia to the Horn of Africa, then parachuted into the water, before finally arriving aboard the Bainbridge. Three of the operators, one for each pirate, took up sniper positions on the fantail of the ship, with presidential authorization to use lethal force, if it was required. The leader of the pirate group was lured onto the USS Braindridge under the assumption that his group's leaders were aboard the ship and negotiations were going to be held. However, shortly after boarding the ship, SEALs and Navy personnel disarmed the assailant. He would later stand trial in the U.S. for piracy. At one point, following a struggle between the pirates and Capt. Phillips where shots were fired, the SEALs felt the hostage's life was in imminent danger. When the first opportunity appeared and the heads of all three captors were visible at the same time, all three snipers fired simultaneously, killing all three pirates at once with head-shots. Phillips was then successfully rescued, bringing the stand-off to an end. =The Capture of Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame= The United States had been in a relentless pursuit of Warsame for some time. After JSOC and American intelligence determined when and where Warsame would be by tracking his cell phone and analyzing information provided by local spies, a snatch and grab operation was considered. Intelligence indicated that Warsame would be traveling with a single associate in international body of water. He would not have a contingent of heavily armed body guards with him. DEVGRU was prepared to capture Warsame and bring him in. Ever since the successful mission of Operation Celestial Balance, the Obama administration knew it would eventually be faced with the opportunity to capture a high-value terrorist. After months of debate, planning, and legal wrangling. The mission to capture Warsame was authorized. Next, at dusk on April 19, 2011. Warsame was finally in the international waters in his boat with just his associate. Seal team 6 operatives had with them a harmless looking traditional wooden ship sailing towards Warsame's fishing boat in the Gulf of Aden. The Seals were hidden behind the wooden ship in Navy fast boats. Snipers were placed on a nearby vessel as overwatch in case if the Seals needed sniper cover. The Seals approached Warsame's boat undetected, stealthily boarded, and subdued Warsame and his associate. The Seals transported Warsame and his associate to the USS Boxer. The mission of capturing Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame was a successful operation by the Seals of DEVGRU without a shot being fired.\\"Kill Or Capture: The War on Terror and the Soul of the Obama Presidency\\" by Daniel Klaidman pg. 238-239. =Operation Octave Fusion= In a mission codenamed Octave Fusion, on 24 January 2012, operators from DEVGRU Blue squadron,Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.284 successfully rescued American Jessica Buchanan, 32, and Dane Poul Hagen Thisted, 60, who had been detained by Somali bandits in north-central Somalia. The pair had been abducted around the area of Galkayo three months earlier while working as aid workers helping to remove land mines. Officials stated plans for a rescue operation had been under development for weeks, but acted after discovering that Buchanan's health was deteriorating due to an undisclosed illness.\\"U.S. forces rescue kidnapped aid workers Jessica Buchanan and Poul Hagen Thisted in Somalia\\" The Washington Post Retrieved 25 January 2012 DEVGRU was prepared to capture the hostage takers but this proved unfeasible and nine \\"heavily armed\\" kidnappers were killed.Abdi Sheikh, \\"U.S. commandos free two hostages in daring Somalia raid\\" Reuters 25 January 2012 The SEALs were parachuted in at night before advancing two miles to the enemy compound on foot. After securing the safety of Buchanan and Thisted, the team, who suffered no injuries, were extracted by helicopter.Greg Jaffe, \\"SEAL Team Six parachuted into Somalia on raid\\" The Washington Post 25 January 2012 =Operation against Al-Shabaab in Barawa, 5 October 2013= On October 5, 2013, United States Navy DEVGRU launched a raid against a beachside house primarily to capture a key member of Al-Shabaab, called Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdulkadir, known as \\"Ikrima\\", and to gain intelligence. The SEALs approached the beach from several small boats. 20 SEALs then moved inland, roughly 200 metres towards a two-story building which was confirmed the location of the Al Shabaab commander. The SEALs split into two teams, six SEALs then entered the house while the rest stayed outside to provide a security perimeter. During this time, an Al Shabaab fighter walked out for a cigarette and spotted them and a firefight broke out. SEALs inside the house killed one fighter but chose to withdraw without capturing Ikrima due to an increased number of women and children in the immediate area. War in North-West Pakistan In late 2005, an operation was planned for infiltrating into Pakistan after CIA intelligence was received that indicated al-Zawahiri was attending a meeting in a compound close to the border. They were to parachute in from MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and steer across the Pakistani border from Afghanistan, capture or kill the targets and be extracted by U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command 20th Special Operations Squadron \\"Green Hornets\\" Sikorsky MH-53M Pave Low IV Helicopters. However, as the MC-130s were airborne the mission was aborted; in 2006, a CIA MQ-1B Predator UAV strike in the same area nearly killed Zawahiri.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.233 In March 2006, DEVGRU and the US Army Rangers crossed into Pakistani territory in their hunt for al-Qaeda leaders, allegedly under the codename: Operation Vigilant Harvest. Their target was an al-Qaeda training camp in North Waziristan, they were flown in by the 160th SOAR \\"Nightstalkers\\", the operation has been falsely credited to the Pakistani Special Service Group. The SEALs and the Rangers killed as many as 30 terrorists, including the Chechen camp commandant Imam Asad.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.232-233 In 2008, DEVGRU carried out the Angur Ada raid, targeting unspecified al-Qaeda leadership targets, a number of terrorists were killed but no high-value targets were killed. =Death of Osama bin Laden= Osama bin Laden's hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan. He was killed there on 2 May 2011. On 1‚Äì2 May 2011 DEVGRU's Red Squadron undertook the covert operation codenamed Operation Neptune Spear, under the CIA's authority, and killed Osama bin Laden,Gal Perl Finkel, Back to the ground?, Israel Hayom, November 8, 2015. leader of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda, at his compound in the city of Abbottabad, from Islamabad, the Federal capital of Pakistan. The attack itself lasted 38 minutes. Bin Laden's adult son, a woman, and two couriers were also killed. There were no casualties to the team. They had practiced the mission \\"on both American coasts\\" and in a segregated section of Camp Alpha at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan in early April 2011, using a replica of bin Laden's compound. Modified MH-60 helicopters from the U.S. Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment Airborne \\"Nightstalkers\\" carried DEVGRU \\"Red Squadron\\" operators and paramilitary operatives from the CIA's Special Activities Division. Other personnel supported with tactical signals, intelligence collectors, and navigators using highly classified hyperspectral imagers from Ghazi Air Base in Pakistan. Because of its covert nature, the raid was a CIA operation with DEVGRU being transferred under CIA authority for its duration. A 1 May memo from CIA Director Leon Panetta thanked the National Security Agency and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, whose mapping and pattern-recognition software was likely used to determine that there was \\"high probability\\" that Bin Laden lived in the compound. Members of these agencies were paired with JSOC units in forward-deployed fusion cells to \\"exploit and analyze\\" battlefield data instantly using biometrics, facial recognition systems, voice print databases, and predictive models of insurgent behavior based on surveillance and computer-based pattern analysis. The operation was a result of years of intelligence work that included the capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM), the tracking of the courier to the Abbottabad compound by CIA paramilitary operatives, and the establishing of a CIA safe house that provided critical ground intelligence. On the first anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden the Combatting Terrorism Center released documents seized from Osama bin Laden's Abbottabad home. The Associated Press reported that the troops had been trained to search for documents, computer files and \\"pocket litter\\" \\"that might produce leads to other terrorists\\". In popular culture, several books have tried to capture the events of the mission. The first of which was the 2011 graphic novel published by IDW Publishing, Code Word: Geronimo, written by retired Marine Corps Captain Dale Dye and Julia Dye, and illustrated by former U.S. Army combat medic Gerry Kissell. Later, the controversial book Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former Navy SEAL, that disputed the accounts by the DoD of how the events occurred the night of the raid on the compound. Finally, in 2012, the book No Easy Day was released. The book was written by a DEVGRU Red Squadron operator writing under the pseudonym \\"Mark Owen\\", who was part of Operation Neptune Spear and claimed to be one of the two operators who engaged Bin Laden. Then, in 2012, a film directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by Mark Boal was released called Zero Dark Thirty. The film portrayed the hunt for Osama Bin Laden and the raid performed by DEVGRU. Another film, Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden, depicting the events of Operation Neptune Spear, was also released in 2012. The events in the film have neither been \\"confirmed nor denied\\" by White House officials.. For the operation, President Barack Obama awarded the unit the Presidential Unit Citation. Al-Qaeda insurgency in Yemen =Hostage Rescue operation, Hajr al-Sayar district - Yemen, 26 November 2014= A U.S. official confirmed that about two dozen U.S. special operations forces and a team of Yemeni counterterrorism troops conducted a raid near the border with Saudi Arabia that rescued six Yemenis, a Saudi and an Ethiopian. Eight militants were killed during the operation. =Yakla raid, 29 January 2017= U.S. Marine MV-22 Ospreys on the amphibious assault ship USS Makin Island, December 21, 2016. On January 29, 2017, the New York Times reported that SEALs from SEAL Team Six carried out the surprise dawn attack on an AQAP headquarters in Bayda Province that a senior American official said counterterrorism officials had deemed valuable enough to warrant a ground operation rather than an airstrike. However, based on eyewitness statements the element of surprise was (partially) lost after residents of the targeted location heard the sound of unmanned aerial vehicles several hours before US ground forces arrived (but allegedly did not expect a ground raid). The US military stated the raid led to ‚Äúthe capture of information that will likely provide insight into the planning of future terror plots.\\" Reuters reported that the raid began with a drone attack on the home of Abdulraoof al-Dhahab, followed by the arrival of paratroopers. According to this account, corroborated among residents, a Yemeni security official, and a local official, \\"helicopters bombed the [al Qaeda] gunmen and a number of homes and led to a large number of casualties.\\" A senior American official said a USMC MV-22B Osprey that was sent from USS Makin Island (LHD-8) to evacuate the wounded troops in the raid crash-landed nearby, leaving two more service members injured. American forces intentionally destroyed the aircraft with further airstrikes. The raid killed three prominent members of Al Qaeda: Abdulraoof al-Dhahab, Sultan al-Dhahab and Seif al-Nims The US military estimated that 14 Qaeda fighters were killed in the raid, that women were among the Qaeda fighters killed and injured, and that \\"the SEALs saw the women running to fighting positions as the team approached.\\" According to medical reports, eight women and seven children, aged 3 to 13, were killed in the raid. U.S. citizen Nawar al-Awlaki, the eight-year-old daughter of Al Qaeda preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, killed in a 2011 drone strike, was among those killed. The US military initially denied there were any civilian casualties, but later declared it was investigating if they occurred.

At the time, women were not allowed to serve in the Union Army so Wilson and Graves had to masquerade as men.  Pre-Civil War  Born in Long Island, New York, Wilson fell in love with and became engaged to a man before taking a trip to Lafayette, Indiana to visit some relatives in 1860. Her friend, Graves, accompanied her on this trip. Both were deeply in love with men they had left back home. In early 1861, as America moved closer to Civil War Wilson and Graves returned home to Long Island. During the trip home, they thought of a plan to stay close to their lovers if war should occur, since both men had stated they would join the Union Army should war break out. They intended to enlist in the same regiment as their men, but in different companies. This would lessen their risk of discovery, while still being close to their lovers.  Civil War  In 1862, the two men enlisted in the new regiment being formed at Camp Cadwallader, in Beverly, New Jersey. The 24th New Jersey Infantry Regiment was mustered into Federal service on September 16, 1862. Wilson and Graves enacted their plan. They cut their hair and put on men's clothing. Graves had a more difficult time concealing her sex than Wilson did. Wilson was described as having a \\"... masculine voice\\" and as \\"tanned and smart and somewhat educated.\\" She was nineteen at the time. Their plan worked, they marched and trained alongside their lovers without being discovered. They served in the defense of Washington D.C. until December 1862 when the regiment was sent to Fredericksburg, Virginia, where they participated in the Battle of Fredericksburg. After seeing the horrors of war firsthand, both women viewed their service in a more serious light. They were determined to continue serving, not because of their lovers, but because they felt a need to serve their country. In early May 1863, the regiment fought in the Battle of Chancellorsville. During the battle, Wilson's lover was seriously wounded. After the battle, Wilson took care and watched over him, nearly revealing herself. Despite Wilson's effort, her lover died. At some point during this time, Graves' lover was also killed, however it is unknown when or where he died. Soon after their lovers' deaths, Wilson and Graves contracted an 'unspecified' illness. Both were sent to an army hospital in Cairo, Illinois. While there Wilson and Graves' true sex was discovered. Graves recovered first and was discharged, parting ways with Wilson. After Wilson was discharged she became a ballet dancer with the Cairo Theater. After two performances she quit and looked for another regiment to join, feeling the need to serve her country. She joined the 3rd Illinois Cavalry as they were on their way to Vicksburg, Mississippi. During the second assault on Vicksburg on May 22 Wilson was wounded in battle, though not seriously. She was treated without her true sex being discovered. She fully recovered and continued on with the regiment. On August 5, 1863, Wilson was riding through Memphis, Tennessee with a fellow soldier when a guard stopped them. She was arrested on suspicion of being a woman in men's clothing and being a spy. While being questioned, she proved she was a Union soldier. Soon after, the authorities discharged her with female clothing and made her promise she would not disguise herself as a man again. Fanny died on September 15, 1864 of disease. She is buried in the Memphis Tennessee National Cemetery, grave 621 (reference: US National Cemetery Interment Control Forms).

Her work combines images, sound, and text to investigate how the mind processes information. While themes of displacement, alienation, and synchronicity permeate her videos and interventions, her text-based works explore post-alphabetic communication, hyperconnectivity and ‚Äúnoise‚Äù as systems of information.Artist statement, LMAK projects Collazo-Llorens is the granddaughter of the Puerto Rican literary critic, linguist, and lexicographer, Washington Llorens. Though born and raised in Puerto Rico, she attended college and graduate school in the United States, receiving her BFA in printmaking and graphic design from the Massachusetts College of Art in 1990 and her MFA from New York University in 2002. She has taught at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University School of Art, Kalamazoo College, and, from fall 2014 to spring 2017, held the position of Stuart and Barbara Padnos Distinguished Artist in Residence at Grand Valley State University. Early work, influences, and context Collazo-Llorens is a member of a generation of artists who critic Manuel Alvarez Lezama has dubbed ‚ÄúLos Nov√≠simos‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Newest Ones‚Äù ‚Äì which he defines as Puerto Rican artists coming of artistic age in the 1990s responsible for an infusion of provocative contemporary art into the Puerto Rican art scene.Deborah Cullen, ‚ÄúHere and There: Six Artists from San Juan‚Äù in Here & There / Aqu√≠ y all√° (New York: El Museo del Barrio, 2001), 12. The artists of ‚ÄúLos Nov√≠simos‚Äù ‚Äì including Allora & Calzadilla, Fernando Col√≥n Gonzalez, Yvelisse Jim√©nez, Arnaldo Morales, and Miguel Trelles ‚Äì often use mapping terminology, such as the metaphor of the ‚Äúaxis,‚Äù discussed by key Latin American cultural critics such as Monica Amor, Guillermo G√≥mez-Pe√±a, and Gerardo Mosquera, among others. Curator Silvia Karman Cubi√±a sees the work of this generation of artists as neo-conceptual, ‚Äúin which object and content are mutually dependent.‚Äù For her, ‚Äúthese artists navigate issues of identity, displacement and politics, but contrary to [Puerto Rican] artists of previous generations, they do so without nostalgia or resistance.‚ÄùSilvia Karman Cubi√±a, ‚ÄúNotes on Neoconceptualism from Puerto Rico‚Äù in None of the Above: Contemporary Work by Puerto Rican Artists (Hartford, CT: Real Art Ways, 2004), 22. Holland Cotter, speaking of Collazo- Llorens's participation in the exhibition None of the Above: Contemporary Work by Puerto Rican Artists at Real Art Ways in Hartford, Connecticut, writes: \\"the diaspora phenomenon has become the basis for a new kind of identity politics. The art it produces is internationalist in style, embracing photography, video and installation, and tends to hold what might be called indigenous culture at a wry arm's length, in some cases bypassing it.\\"Holland Cotter, \\"None of the Above - Contemporary Work by Puerto Rican Artists\\" in ART IN REVIEW, The New York Times, June 4, 2004. Collazo-Llorens adheres to the notion of non-linear narratives as in the writing of such authors as Julio Cort√°zar, Mark Z. Danielewski, and Don Delillo, as well as to theories of perception ‚Äì based on the dislocation of time and place through travel ‚Äì espoused by Wolfgang Schivelbusch and Mitchell Schwarzer.Kathleen MacQueen, ‚ÄúNayda Collazo-Llorens: The Consistency of Chaos,‚Äù a companion essay to the exhibition An Exercise in Numbness & Other Tales, Richmond Center for Visual Arts, September 6-October 5, 2012, unpaginated. Her interest in the non- hierarchical, rhizomatic arrangement of data is reflective of Deleuze and Guattari‚Äôs emphasis on the nomadic nature of knowledge: ‚ÄúTo be rhizomorphous is to produce stems and filaments that seem to be roots, or better yet connect with them by penetrating the trunk, but put them to strange new uses.‚ÄùGilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, trans. Brian Massumi (University of Minnesota Press, 1987). It is these ‚Äústrange new uses‚Äù that infiltrate an art derived from her bifurcated existence between Puerto Rico and the United States. She takes the language of cartography ‚Äì part of her familial as well as artistic environment ‚Äì and links it to digital communication and code-switching (the splicing of Spanish and English), working it through intersections that are both systematic and random: replete with directed thought and disconnected noise. ‚ÄúCollazo-Llorens builds a text of alienation ‚Äì of being alien,‚Äù writes art critic and theorist Kathleen MacQueen, ‚Äúas an existential process of identifying what it means to be human.‚ÄùKathleen MacQueen, \\"Subtle Intensities of the Unexpected,\\" By Chance, A Video Show. 80WSE Galleries, 25 Jan. 2011. Works on paper and canvas An accomplished printmaker, Collazo-Llorens is, according to curator Deborah Cullen, ‚Äúa sophisticated draftsperson who‚Ä¶has been producing personal, visceral drawings on a daily basis over several years. Small but intensely powerful, they are compact expressionistic worlds comfortable simultaneously in the language of the bodily and the schematic.‚Äù Curator Laura Roulet sees Collazo-Llorens's paintings as revealing ‚Äúa post-minimalist aesthetic, with the systematic organization of Hanne Darboven or Eva Hesse, and the calligraphic mark making and erasures of Cy Twombly or Brice Marden.‚ÄùLaura Roulet, ‚ÄúNavigable Zones,‚Äù a companion essay to the exhibition Navigable Zones, Project 4 Gallery, Washington, D.C., 2007, unpaginated. The methodology of these subjective and intimate drawings broadens into expansive mappings either on canvas or directly on the wall. Since 2012, her on-going Test series consist of map-like structures that function as systems of visual information while marks can be ‚Äúread‚Äù as hyperlinked terrains or mindscapes.Nayda Collazo- Llorens website. MacQueen sees ‚Äúthis unfolding of space between geographical coordinates [as] an exposure of the vectors that chart personal experience.‚ÄùKathleen MacQueen, \\"Subtle Intensities of the Unexpected,\\" By Chance, A Video Show. 80WSE Galleries, 25 Jan. 2011. Video and installation For Collazo-Llorens drawing does not remain confined to or isolated by the sheet of paper or canvas but merges with mixed media and video into elaborate installations. Cullen understands Collazo-Llorens's installation work as a ‚ÄúGesamtkunstwerk, or total work, in which all the individual pieces of the project relate to and amplify one another.‚Äù In her Unfolding the Triangle ‚Äì a series of three separate installations representing different geographical areas, created in 2009, 2011, and 2012 ‚Äì ‚Äúdirectional lines, numerical symbols and words activate the space and engage the visitor in the unfolding, a situational mapping in which the viewer collaborates in ‚Äòreading‚Äô the physical installation space.‚Äù Unfolding the Triangle ‚Äì Lake Michigan (2012) was included in a major solo exhibition of the artist‚Äôs work at the Richmond Center for Visual Arts, Kalamazoo, Michigan, entitled An Exercise in Numbness and Other Tales. Also included was an installation reflecting both the tradition of monumental history painting and media billboard display ‚Äì Comfortably Numb (2012) ‚Äì an archive of over 1,500 framed images collected from magazines and newspapers. Virginia Harbin appreciates this work as ‚Äúa collection not of hierarchical information, but rather an experiential archive of the everyday.‚ÄùVirginia Allison Harbin, ‚ÄúNavigating the Rhizomatic Archive: Temporal Leaps and Loops in Nayda Collazo-Llorens‚Äô Recent Works,‚Äù ARC Magazine May 2013: 16-23. Though the work references obsolete technology, it also intimates the barrage of images and words ‚Äúthat comes through our digital devices, constantly pushing information,‚Äù which is understood by the artist as being responsible for an increasingly fragmented and dissociated existence. In her video work, she expresses these ideas through non-linear means: for example, in Reverb, a 2012 site-specific video installation for Medios y Ambientes, Museo Universitario del Chopo in Mexico City, ‚Äúthe idea of the loop is taken further by the fact that there are multiple video loops of different lengths that are engaged by the installation‚Äôs video feedback. This effect repeats the video images exponentially and infinitely‚Ä¶these repetitions layer and decay with every loop, to the point of being un-viewable/unreadable.‚ÄùNayda Collazo-Llorens in Virginia Allison Harbin, ‚ÄúNavigating the Rhizomatic Archive: Temporal Leaps and Loops in Nayda Collazo-Llorens‚Äô Recent Works,‚Äù ARC Magazine May 2013: 16-23. Interventions and public art Nayda Collazo-Llorens worked as studio assistant to the conceptual artist Antoni Muntadas from 2001 until 2006. His interest in the relationship between public and private space and the ways in which channels of information are used to censor or promulgate ideasAntoni Muntadas, Faculty Profile, MIT Program in Art, Culture, and Technology, influenced the direction Collazo-Llorens would take her own work; but while Muntadas addresses social and political communication, Collazo-Llorens ‚Äúprobes the [more personal] processes of seeing, remembering, and communicating.‚ÄùDeborah Cullen, ‚ÄúMindscapes by Nayda Collazo-Llorens: The Poetics of Opposition,‚Äù companion essay to Mindscapes at Space Other, Boston, January, 2006, unpaginated. Though much of the artist's work considers the indiscriminate assortment of thought, memory, and data within a technological society, not all of it is existentially nihilistic. Recent work includes a temporary textual intervention on the paths of the Miami Beach Botanical Gardens based on testimonies collected from Miami Beach locals and visitors. Commissioned by the Bass Museum of Art, Pleasure, Fear, and the Pursuit of Happiness (2013), marks the pathways with dozens of colorful, round, text decals. The narrative of these ‚Äúsampled‚Äù words and phrases serves more as a trigger for new thought than as a reservoir of random recollections. Wave / Onda (2004 to 2010) is the artist's first permanent public art installation. Created in collaboration with Toro Ferrer Architects for the University of Puerto Rico's General Studies building, it uses color to evoke a series of waves crossing the building's fa√ßade, ‚Äúformally organizing this once haphazard access to the university grounds.‚ÄùToro Ferrer Arquitectos.

Ever Failed. A Politics of Intimacy,‚Äù a talk given at the School of Visual Arts, October 23, 2013. Cullen finds language to be ‚Äúa critical element in her works, [that] shifts easily between Spanish and English, and incorporates counterpoints that range from diaristic, poetic snippets to snatches from advertising, signage, or the news.‚Äù The context of her work, writes MacQueen, ‚Äúis the human psyche, disparate and unknowable, yet manifest in the actions we undertake.‚Äù Whether through visual or textual signs, throughout her work, there is a consistent emphasis on the relation between perception and the technological environment and its impact on human relations. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm neither critiquing technology nor supporting it,‚Äù says the artist, ‚Äúrather, exploring the contemporary reality it has produced.‚ÄùNayda Collazo-Llorens quoted in Virginia Allison Harbin, ‚ÄúNavigating the Rhizomatic Archive: Temporal Leaps and Loops in Nayda Collazo- Llorens‚Äô Recent Works,‚Äù ARC Magazine May 2013: 16-23. Recognition In 2014, Collazo-Llorens was recognized with a fellowship from the Arcus Center for Social Justice Leadership to undertake practice-based research resulting in a temporary site-specific text-based wall installation for the newly completed ACSJL. It featured a collection of sampled text appearing to enter the building through the windows, as if voices from the community‚Äîoften unheard, marginalized, unaddressed or ignored‚Äîwere inflowing into this space dedicated to social justice.From an unpublished grant proposal.

He was appointed a Tennessee militia general in 1835 during the Second Seminole War. He was a colonel in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Early life Joel Battle was born in Davidson County, Tennessee on September 19, 1811. He became an orphan at an early age, but despite this became a very rich man under the slavery system economics of Tennessee. By 19 years old, he married Sarah Searcy who gave birth to his first son William. Sarah died two years after giving birth. Battle, now a widower, raised a company for the Second Seminole War in Cane Ridge. By 1835, Battle was promoted to Brigadier General of the Tennessee Militia. He eventually remarried to Adeline Sanders Mosley, and had 6 more children. He was also elected to the Tennessee General Assembly becoming a popular Whig. Civil war In April 1861, when the American Civil War began, Battle raised an infantry company in Nolensville, Tennessee which he named the Zollicoffer Guards, paying respect to Felix Zollicoffer with whom he had fought with in Florida. The company became part of the 20th Tennessee Infantry and Battle was appointed as its Colonel. The regiment joined a brigade commanded by Battle's good friend Zollicoffer. During the Battle of Mill Springs Zollicoffer was killed and Battle's son Lieutenant Joel Battle Jr., who was serving as the regimental adjutant, was wounded. In the Battle of Shiloh, Colonel Battle lost two of his sons, Joel Jr. and William. The Colonel was wounded and captured while looking for his sons - William's body was never found and Joel Jr. was discovered by John Calvin Lewis, a Union soldier who was recruited into Beta Theta Pi by Joel Jr. at Miami University. Out of respect for his brother, Lewis buried Joel Jr. in a personal grave. After his capture the demoralized Battle was brought to Johnson's Island, effectively ending his career in the military. After being exchanged, Battle was appointed State treasurer of Tennessee, which he occupied until the end of the Civil War. When his son Frank Battle was captured during the war, he was used as leverage by the Union side to force the return of Captain Shad Harris who was under threat of execution as a spy. Joel Allen Battle relented and the prisoner transfer, which was endorsed by President Lincoln, took place. Battle also had to deal with the arrest and imprisoning of his daughter Fannie along with her friend Harriet Booker in Camp Chase on suspicion of her being a Confederate spy. Later life After the war, Battle was appointed superintendent of the Tennessee State Prison. He retained the position until his death, caused by severe dysentery, on August 23, 1872.

Between the 1910s and 1950s he encouraged and published the work of many of the writers of the so-called Great American Songbook, and was president of Chappell & Co., Inc., the world's largest music publishing firm. Biography He was born in Kuppenheim, Germany, the son of a cattle dealer. At the age of 14 he traveled to the USA at the invitation of family friend Aaron Lehman who had immigrated to Jackson, Mississippi. Initially, Dreyfus worked as a travelling salesman selling picture frames, but by the mid-1890s worked on Tin Pan Alley in New York City where he worked closely with songwriter Paul Dresser and transcribed song arrangements. Within a few years he had secured a post with the publishing firm set up by Thomas B. Harms (1860-1906), arranging, plugging songs, and doing some songwriting; his song \\"Cupid's Garden\\", published under the pseudonym Max Eugene, was successful in 1901. Steven Suskin, The Sound of Broadway Music: A Book of Orchestrators and Orchestrations, Oxford University Press, 2011 Harms sold his share in the family publishing firm in 1904 to Max and his younger brother Louis Dreyfus (1877-1967), who had joined him in the US. The two brothers retained the company name T. B. Harms, and established a partnership with the London firm of Francis, Day & Hunter, allowing them to market their songs in Britain. They also encouraged young new songwriters in New York, most notably Jerome Kern, who soon achieved success and became a partner in the company. After the First World War, the company had commercial success with songs such as \\"Poor Butterfly\\", and more songwriters joined the company, including George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart, Rudolf Friml, Vincent Youmans, Irving Caesar, and Cole Porter. Biography at Allmusic.com. Retrieved 6 June 2014 In 1920, the brothers were approached by the British publishers, Chappell & Co., to handle their interests in the US. By 1926, they had bought Chappell outright, and shortly before the Great Depression they made a highly profitable sale of their interest in T. B. Harms. The companies remained independent of the Hollywood system which bought up many of the other publishing houses, with the result that the brothers retained a strong financial position. In 1935, they reconstituted their holdings as Chappell, Inc., with Louis Dreyfus moving to London and Max remaining in control of their New York operations, based in the Rockefeller Center. Max Dreyfus was \\"a softspoken, slightly built man who was reserved almost to a fault.\\" He was seen as a \\"man of integrity\\" and a \\"gifted talent spotter\\". He helped found ASCAP (the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers) in 1914, and served as a board member for fifty years until shortly before his death. He pioneered a new style of orchestration for theatre performances, employing Russell Bennett as the company's chief orchestrator from 1919. He established a company policy under which composers, lyricists and librettists were all in partnership with the publishing company. He insisted on exclusive contracts for many of his writers and orchestrators working on Broadway shows, with the result that \\"through the thirties and forties, Dreyfus had a virtual stranglehold on the Broadway musical, with almost all of the most successful songwriters (except Berlin) under contract. And the best and most knowledgeable theatrical orchestrators as well.\\" He remained in control of Chappell & Co. after World War II, with new writers including Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, whose My Fair Lady he published. Although other independent publishers took a larger share of the market after the war, Chappell also found success with South Pacific, The Sound of Music, Gypsy, and Funny Girl, among others. Dreyfus was played by Charles Coburn, who was considerably bulkier and more gregarious than him, in the 1945 Gershwin biographical film Rhapsody in Blue. Dreyfus did not like the film, saying to a friend, ‚ÄúDid you ever see me wear a top hat ?‚Äù Personal life Max Dreyfus and his wife, the former Victoria Brill, had no children. They bought a 300-acre summer home near Brewster, New York, Madrey Farm, in 1929. The property had formerly been owned by Daniel Drew, the 19th century railroad magnate, who is buried on the property. There Victoria Dreyfus raised Percheron horses and cattle, and the couple entertained Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and other eminent musicians. Dreyfus died at Madrey Farm in 1964, aged 90. \\"Max Dreyfus, Music Publisher Who Headed Chappell, 90, Dies\\", New York Times, May 16, 1964.

It is located in the town of Odda. It is the church for the Odda parish which is part of the Hardanger og Voss prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The off-white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1870 using designs by the architect C. Erichsen. The church seats about 500 people. History The first church in Odda was a stone church that was built slightly to the north of the present site. That first church was built between the years 1250 and 1300. There may have been a wooden church on the site before that time, but that is not known. The stone church, which stood for about 600 years was torn down in 1869. A new church was built slightly to the south and the stone from the old church was used as the foundation for the new church. The church was consecrated on 4 November 1870 by the Bishop Peter Hersleb Graah Birkeland. By the early 20th century, the graveyard surrounding the church was getting full, so a new cemetery site was chosen in 1930, at Berjaflot about to the south. In 1955, the church was renovated extensively.

She is shown being given Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a clinical treatment and being discussed at a lecture for medical students.Stephen Lacey [ Tony Garnett], Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2007, p.70 In Two Minds was influenced by the ideas of R.

In his review for The Listener, the novelist Anthony Burgess felt the play had not found a resolution for Kate's problems and found the form of the play problematic. Despite accusing the whole Wednesday Play series as being 'anti-art,' he wrote that In Two Minds \\"was better than art because it was so real\\".Brandt British Television Drama, p.104 Conversely, within the BBC Drama department, the play had led to intense discussions between producer Tony Garnett and department head Sydney Newman over its status as drama and its veracity.Lacey Tony Garnett, p.56-57 Legacy In Two Minds won the Writers' Guild Award for the Best Television Play of 1967.

The company manufactures a diverse range of single pigment dispersions, color and additive concentrates and custom compounds. A sister company, Infinity LTL Engineered Compounds, manufactures custom compounded engineered thermoplastics, and has locations in Swedesboro, New Jersey, and Morrisville, Pennsylvania. Vi-Chem, acquired in 2016, is a producer of PVC and elastomeric compounds. Founded in Ohio in 1941, Americhem employs over 500 people worldwide. It has ten manufacturing sites in North America, Europe, and Asia that provide service to customers in over 50 countries worldwide with products for the plastics and synthetic fibers industries.  History  On November 29, 1941, Alabama native Sylvester S. Caldwell founded The Caldwell Company in Akron, OH. The company started as a manufacturer‚Äôs representative with Thompson Weinman & Co., a manufacturer in the rubber industry, as the first and principal client. During World War II natural rubber became scarce due to rationing. The Caldwell Co. took on more clients to keep profits up including Harmon Color; this marked the company‚Äôs first experience with colorant. In September 1943 Caldwell Co. became incorporated, which was followed by fast growth and new customers. Due to the growth, the company was relocated to its own building on Cutler Parkway while remaining in Akron, OH. Richard H. Juve joined the company in June 1953 and introduced a line of stabilizing products to push sales in the rubber industry. He was followed by Harvey E. Cooper who joined in 1958 as a chemist from Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Both men acquired equal shares of The Caldwell Company making them President and Vice President of the company. On September 2, 1959, the first manufacturing plant was opened on Home Ave. in Akron, OH. This was the beginning of The Caldwell Co. manufacturing its own products. With the change in business operations, The Caldwell Co. quickly changed their name to Americhem Inc. The newly named company began regularly producing their own products in 1960. With funding from issuance of bonds, Americhem was able to develop a number of new commercial products. By the end of 1964, Americhem was manufacturing color concentrates for ABS, many of which were used for the RV industry. In July 1965, Americhem Headquarters was moved to a new building in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. There was also an expansion with manufacturing in 1969 when a new plant was purchased in Medina, OH. Also in 1969, Americhem designed and manufactured the first masterbatches for vinyl siding. This marked the company‚Äôs first step into the building products industry. Americhem then became a member of the Vinyl Siding Institute and helped invent tests along with standards for weathering and durability that are still used today. Americhem was one of the first companies to use IBM System/3 computers and ACS Color Matching computers that were installed in 1972. Then in 1973, they opened their first out of state plant located in Elgin, Illinois. This plant eventually became the new location of the Medina, OH plant. The 1973 oil crisis devastated the automotive industry, which in turn severely affected sales at Americhem. During this time, Americhem gained business in the packaging and construction industries, which led to an upturn in profits. In 1974, partial owner Harvey Cooper retired, leaving ownership of Americhem Inc. to Richard Juve who became majority owner. In 1978, Americhem reached a milestone when opening their first research department. The new laboratory led to the production of Americhem‚Äôs first color concentrates for synthetic fibers in response to the new developments of nylon and polyester dispersion technology. In 1987, Americhem received ‚ÄúBest Technical Paper‚Äù for the presentation ‚ÄúWeathering Metamerism: A Photochemical Process‚Äù and again in 1988 for ‚ÄúRefractive Index: A Key to Understanding Color Difference.‚Äù Around the same time, Americhem purchased Colourfast Plastics Ltd. in England to expand their international presence. Then, in order to be strategically located in the heart of the textile industry, Americhem opened a plant in Concord, North Carolina, in 1989. Americhem opened a new plant on Steels Corners Road in Cuyahoga Falls, OH in 1998‚Äù In 2001, Americhem introduced a polyester solution dye product line for automotive interiors which still continues to be an excellent market that the company excels in. A plant was opened in 2002 located in the carpet capital of the world, Dalton, Georgia. Americhem continued to expand internationally with the establishment of the Luxembourg sales office in 2003, the Mexico City sales office in 2004, and the Suzhou, China plant that opened in 2006 and was expanded in 2014. In the early 2000s, Americhem introduced the first variegated wood grain products for composite deck board applications in 2005, an outdoor color line for polyester fibers, and a low heat build-up technology for dark construction colors in 2006.In 2007, a new company logo and brand were introduced to the market. This included a reimagining of the traditional logo and new company colors: navy blue and sage green. 2009 saw a push for more eco-friendly practices. Americhem implemented lighting improvements to improve energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce the company‚Äôs carbon footprint. All plants and offices started participating in recycling programs and all plants switched from using carbon dioxide to liquid nitrogen as a coolant. The seventh Americhem plant was opened in 2010 in Liberty, NC with a specialty of black, white and additive masterbatch products. In 2011, Americhem Inc. celebrated their 70-year anniversary, which was recognized by the governor of Ohio and mayor of Cuyahoga Falls. Americhem will celebrate its 75-year anniversary on November 29, 2016. The Queen‚Äôs Award for Enterprise was awarded to Americhem for the second time in the category of International Trade in 2012. Americhem also won the Material of the Year award from Material Connexion in NYC for their photochromatic \\"blushing bottles.\\" Americhem U, a series of informational seminars for customers, was introduced in 2011 and continues to this day. On December 28, 2012 Americhem Inc. purchased Infinity Compounding in Swedesboro, NJ later changing their name to Americhem Infinity Engineered Compounds. In 2014, the Americhem Manchester, U.K. factory was granted ISO/TS 16949 certification. The Cuyahoga Falls plant received ISO 14001 environmental certification in 2014. In December 2014, LTL Color Compounders was purchased. This precolor compound maker was merged with Americhem Infinity to form Infinity LTL Engineered Compounds. In March 2016, Americhem acquired Vi-Chem Corporation of Grand Rapids, MI, a producer of PVC and elastomeric compounds, specializing in \\"soft touch\\" technology for the automotive industry.  Americhem products  Americhem manufactures color and additive masterbatches (also known as color and additive concentrates) for use in the plastics and synthetic fibers industries. Most of the company‚Äôs products are made for specific customers and specific applications. In addition, Americhem makes single pigment dispersions, which are used by customers as a stand-alone product or to mix to create their own colors. Additives can be included with the color concentrates, including but not limited to antioxidants, UV stabilizers, flame retardants, slip and antistatic agents, optical brighteners, antimicrobials and nucleating agents. These additives can also be made as stand-alone products, with or without color. Infinity LTL, manufactures and sells engineering grade, custom compounded precolored polymer composites to meet the demands of specific customer applications. The company specializes in a wide range of engineered polymers with no minimum order size and provides a high level of technical support and a flexible customer focused style.

It was developed by Armstrong before 1892 and saw service in the Russo-Japanese War during the siege of Port Arthur and the Second Sino-Japanese War. Design and description The 28 cm Howitzer L/10 was designed in 1884 by the British Armstrong company. Armstrong had an Italian subsidiary which produced guns for the Italian Navy and Major Pompeo Grillo, a heavy artillery specialist was hired in April 1884 to help the construction of artillery at a new plant in Osaka. The description from Brassey's Naval Annual of 1892 reads \\"The howitzer was a 28-cm rifled breech- loader of cast iron, 9 calibres long made at Osaka, from the designs of guns made for the Italians by Sir W.G. Armstrong\\". The Italians produced the design in a number of different lengths and they were designated by their diameter and length in calibers 280/9, 280/10, 280/11, and 280/16. Some 220 pieces were manufactured by the Osaka Artillery Arsenal for Japanese coastal defence.Website about IJA 28 cm Howitzer It was mounted on a turntable which was fixed to a steel firing platform. It required two to four days to emplace for firing. An ammunition crane was fixed to the carriage for ease of loading. The howitzer entered service in 1892 and was installed in shore batteries in forts overlooking Tokyo Bay and Osaka Bay, and had been intended for anti-ship operations. However it saw use as a siege gun during the Russo-Japanese War due to a lack of heavy siege guns. Combat history =Russo-Japanese War= A shell, visible above the smoke, is fired on Port Arthur During the Russo- Japanese War the Japanese Third Army was besieging Port Arthur. While the capture of Port Arthur had been achieved in a single assault during the First Sino-Japanese War the situation was different in 1904. The Russians had been in possession of Port Arthur since 1897 and had constructed strong fortifications around the city following the plans of General Eduard Totleben. After the first general assault in August 1904 and over 16,000 casualties General Nogi, the commanding officer of the Japanese forces, requested heavy siege guns. With the arrival of the first battery of 28 cm howitzers, replacing those lost when the transport Hitachi Maru, loaded with a battalion of the First Reserve Regiment of the Guards, was sunk by Russian cruisers in the Hitachi Maru Incident on June 15, 1904, the situation changed. The massive, 11-inch, howitzers could throw a 217 kilogram (478 pound) shell over 7.8 kilometers (4.8 miles),Kowner, p. 151 and Nogi then had the firepower necessary to make a serious attempt against the Russian fortifications. The huge shells were nicknamed \\"roaring trains\\" by the Russian troops (for the sound they made just before impact), and during their period at Port Arthur over 16,949 of these shells were fired.Website about The History of Battles of Imperial Japanese Artillery Forces A 217 kilogram (478 pound) shell of the 28 cm Howitzer. Russian Pacific Fleet At 10:30 on December 5, following another massive artillery bombardment, the Japanese managed to overrun 203 Meter Hill overlooking the harbour of Port Arthur with the Russian Pacific Fleet at anchor. They sent an artillery observer on the hill, directing the fire of the 28 cm howitzer, systematically sinking the Russian fleet, one ship after another. On December 5, 1904, the battleship Poltava was sunk, followed by the battleship Retvizan on December 7, 1904, the battleships Pobeda and Peresvet and the cruisers Pallada and Bayan on December 9, 1904. All six would be raised, repaired, renamed, and recommissioned by the Japanese after the war. The battleship Sevastopol, although hit five times by shells, managed to move out of range of the guns. On the night of January 2, 1905, after Port Arthur surrendered, Captain Nikolai Essen of the Sevastopol had the crippled battleship scuttled in of water by opening the sea cocks on one side, so that the ship would sink on its side and could not be raised and salvaged by the Japanese. =Second Sino-Japanese War= In November 1939 during the Second Sino-Japanese War 28 cm howitzers were deployed at the Yellow River where they put a railway tunnel out of action for over three months. =World War II= Due to a lack of alternatives the Japanese reactivated the 28 cm howitzer for coastal defence in 1945, expecting the landing of the Allies. Thirteen guns were in use on Kyushu, six on Shikoku, 62 on Honshu and 10 on Hokkaido.Zaloga, p. 11 Also, two batteries of the 28 cm howitzers were used by 132nd Independent Mixed Brigade at Dongning, Heilongjiang, during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945.Record of Operations against Soviet Russia, Eastern Front (August 1945), p. 60 Two batteries of 28 cm howitzers were emplaced with the Najin Fortress Garrison in Rason.

It was built by the ethnic German Transylvanian Saxon community at a time when the area belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary. Initially Roman Catholic, it became Lutheran following the Reformation. Description A Romanesque basilica dates to the 13th century; surviving elements include the choir; triumphal arch; pillars between the main and side naves; and parts of the north portal, including the windows and upper level. Fortification work took place in the 16th century, with most of the windows and the entrance room in the western part daring to the 18th. In the 19th century, the nave was given a vaulted ceiling held up by pilasters with capitals. The paintings above the triumphal arch are in the Biedermeier style.

The United Nations (UN) does not define \\"racism\\"; however, it does define \\"racial discrimination\\": According to the 1965 UN International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, \\"...the term \\"racial discrimination\\" shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.\\" Thailand has made two submissions to the Convention, with ongoing issues including government policy towards ethnic groups, especially the Thai Malays, and the country's lack of racial discrimination legislation. Ethnic minorities Thailand's ethnic minorities have been subjected to persecution in Thailand, especially the one million plus members of Thailand's hill tribes. They are frequently viewed as illiterate drug peddlers and opium-growers, with Thai mainstream media perpetuating this image. A 2013 article in the Bangkok Post said, \\"Nearly a million hill peoples and forest dwellers are still treated as outsiders‚Äîcriminals even, since most live in protected forests. Viewed as national security threats, hundreds of thousands of them are refused citizenship although many are natives to the land\\". According to Dr Chayan Vaddanaputti of Chiang Mai University, this was not always the case: \\"Earlier, they were seen by ordinary people in the lowlands as friends and trading partners in a mutually symbiotic relationship between the hills and the valleys. But growing environmental problems after Thailand's national social and economic development plans took off in the late '60s and early '70s, and an influx of Vietnamese migrants during the Vietnam War changed this relationship forever. Then they became the enemies, the 'other'. The demonization and criminalization of ethnic minorities and the perpetuation of the myth that they are non-Thai has been embedded in Thai textbooks, in Thai history and in the mainstream media.\\" Extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, and intimidation of members of Thailand's hill tribes by Thai police and military was rampant under Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's \\"War on Drugs\\", which started in 2003. The Muslim Malay Patani Kingdom of southern Thailand was incorporated into the Thai state in 1785. Being called khaek ('foreigner' or 'guest'), the Thai Malays were subjected to discrimination and political suppression, especially during the regimes of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram and the Thaification policies of the mid-20th century. The south Thailand insurgency of the past 10 years, has repeatedly been met with brutal force by successive Thai governments, especially under the Thaksin Shinawatra administration. Thai Chinese, who now make up 14 percent of Thailand's population, also have had to bear xenophobic sentiments in the past. Besides having had their language and writing suppressed during the Thaification period of the mid-20th century, those of Chinese descent were also required to change their surnames to Thai names. As a result, many younger generations of ethnic Chinese can only communicate in Thai and self-identity solely as Thai.Time of uncertainty lies ahead for Bangkok‚Äôs ethnic Chinese Light skin, dark skin As in much of Asia, dark skin is equated with outdoor labor conditions and the lower classes. Thai culture shares this skin-tone bias with the rest of Asia. In Thailand, this bias is exacerbated by the fact that many of the wealthy Thais in Bangkok are of Chinese descent and have naturally lighter skin than the indigenous Thais from the countryside. There are no laws within the Kingdom of Thailand which outlaws racial discrimination inclusive of racist cliches known in the Western world. Unlike its neighboring nations which have been under colonialism, Thailand's heritage as an uncolonized state also shaped its existing laws unlike its Westernized counterparts after decolonization. This also includes signage promoting racial segregation as was common in the southern United States prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and South Africa under apartheid. A Dunkin Donuts blackface ad aired on Thai television in 2013, causing a stir in Western media, was met for the most part with incomprehension in Thailand. The ad, says Thai cultural commentator Kaewmala, may be controversial, but \\"it's not a comment on black people in general, it's about concepts of beauty and social snobbery in Asia.\\" As most Thai people traditionally have never encountered people of African descent, prejudice toward and stereotypes of people of African descent were absorbed by Thais through the Vietnam War and literature and then movies from the West. Common brands featuring people of African descent include mops, toilet brushes, and tooth paste. Although Thailand has incorporated certain Western ideals concerning beauty, Asian attitudes regarding skin tones have been around for a long time. Prior to contact with the West, Indian culture permeated the early civilizations of Southeast Asia, which possibly included the ideal of fair skin over darker skin. The 20 million strong Isan population, for instance, many of whom are of Laotian and Khmer descent, traditionally had darker skin and studies show that many view themselves as less desirable than those with lighter skin. Skin whitening products have proven increasingly popular in most of Asia, including Thailand and are marketed in such a way as to promote light skin as beautiful and desirable. Yukti Mukdawijitra, a Thammasat University anthropology professor, observes that the idea that light skin is good and dark skin is bad is \\"embedded in Thai culture\\". Xenophobia Thai attitudes towards Burma have been formed by the Thai ethnocentric media of the 1990s and a nationalistic school system, which teaches that Burma is Thailand's traditional enemy, based on repeated wars between the two from the 16th century CE onward. This negative view was further popularized in novels and films, presenting heroic Thais fighting against villainous Burmese invaders. Examples of recent films that portray this are Bang Rajan (2000), The Legend of Suriyothai (2001),Glen Lewis: Virtual Thailand, published 2006, p. 53-54 King Naresuan (film series, 2007 onwards), and Siyama (2008). Thailand has had long standing racial issues with Middle Easterners, who collectively are also called khaek, meaning \\"foreigner\\" or \\"guest\\". \\"There is some debate as to whether the meaning of foreigner / visitor entrenches prejudices against Malay Muslims and Muslims more generally\\". The condemnation of the 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat by countries such as the US and Australia have given rise to an \\"anti- foreigner sentiment\\" with those Thais who are in favor of the coup. In March 2012, Ombudsman Prof. Siracha Charoenpanij, a public advocate appointed by the government, blamed foreigners for the difficulties that Thais faced in owning land, incorrectly claiming that a third of the land area of Thailand, some 100 million rai or 160,000 km2 of premium land, primarily in established beach resorts, was now owned by non-Thais through proxy, and obtained through corruption and the use of legal loopholes. The National Institute of Development Administration supposedly provided these numbers. Due to an increase of Russian and Eastern European tourists in Phuket, Russians have also been the target of xenophobia, with protests and banners saying \\"Russians Get Out\\" in Phuket, and \\"a taxi blockade over suspected Russian transport drivers; illegal shops and businesses\\". Other issues include the Singapore Tourism Board organising a Songkran festival in Singapore without the endorsement of either Thai expats in Singapore, or sponsorship from the Thai authorities. Singapore was accused of \\"stealing 'our' (Thailand's) Songkran\\", with Thai officials threatening lawsuits. In 2014, Thai officials cracked down on Chinese tourists visiting the campus of Chiang Mai University due to their using buses reserved for students, attending lectures, and eating at the student cafeteria. Anti-Khmer sentiment, already high due to border clashes over the Preah Vihear temple, has been fanned by Suthep Thaugsuban, a Yellow Shirt leader.

It is based on the theoretical assumption that every organism‚Äîwhether a single cell or multicellular‚Äîis continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a sensory-motor coupling.Van Duijn, et al. (2006). \\"Principles of minimal cognition: Casting cognition as sensorimotor coordination.\\" That is to say, if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive. Any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the biological conditions in which its genes survive from one generation to the next.Lyon and Opie (2007). ‚ÄúProlegomena for a cognitive biology.‚Äù And since by Darwinian theory the species of every organism is evolving from a common root, three further elements of cognitive biology are required: (i) the study of cognition in one species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, to the study of another species‚Äô cognitive abilities;See for example Spetch and Friedman (2006), \\"Comparative cognition of object recognition.\\". (ii) it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems,Balu≈°ka and Mancuso (2009). Deep evolutionary origins of neurobiology: Turning the essence of ‚Äòneural‚Äô upside-down. and (iii) the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard, the more we understand the nature of cognition.Lyon (2013a) and visit the Comparative Cognition Society to enjoy their publication, Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews.  Overview  While cognitive science endeavors to explain human thought and the conscious mind, the work of cognitive biology is focused on the most fundamental process of cognition for any organism. In the past several decades, biologists have investigated cognition in organisms large[1]See for examples Byrne, et al. (2009), ‚ÄúElephant cognition in primate perspective.‚Äù and small,For instance, Ben Jacob, et al. (2006). \\"Seeking the foundations of cognition in bacteria.‚Äù both plantAs one example, see Calvo and Keijzer (2009), \\"Cognition in plants.\\" and animal.Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews ‚ÄúMounting evidence suggests that even bacteria grapple with problems long familiar to cognitive scientists, including: integrating information from multiple sensory channels to marshal an effective response to fluctuating conditions; making decisions under conditions of uncertainty; communicating with conspecifics and others (honestly and deceptively); and coordinating collective behaviour to increase the chances of survival.‚ÄùLyon and Opie (2007), ‚ÄúProlegomena for a cognitive biology.‚Äù Without thinking or perceiving as humans would have it, an act of basic cognition is arguably a simple step-by-step process through which an organism senses a stimulus, then finds an appropriate response in its repertoire and enacts the response. However, the biological details of such basic cognition have neither been delineated for a great many species nor sufficiently generalized to stimulate further investigation. This lack of detail is due to the lack of a science dedicated to the task of elucidating the cognitive ability common to all biological organisms. That is to say, a science of cognitive biology has yet to be established.There is no mention of cognitive biology, for example, in Frankish and Ramsey (2012), The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science. Nor is cognitive biology mentioned in Margolis, et al.(2012), The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Cognitive Science. A prolegomenaAt the 2007 meeting of the International Society for the History, Philosophy and Social Studies of Biology, a paper was presented with the apt title: ‚ÄúProlegomena for a cognitive biology.‚Äù See Lyon and Opie (2007). for such science was presented in 2007 and several authorsSee Brian Goodwin and Ladislav Kov√°ƒç, discussed below. have published their thoughts on the subject since the late 1970s. Yet, as the examples in the next section suggest, there is neither consensus on the theory nor widespread application in practice. Although the two terms are sometimes used synonymously,See p135, 136, and 150 in Huber and Wilkinson (2012). cognitive biology should not be confused with the biology of cognition in the sense that it is used by adherents to the Chilean School of Biology of Cognition. Also known as the Santiago School, the biology of cognition is based on the work of Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana,Maturana (1970), ‚ÄúBiology of Cognition.‚Äù who crafted the doctrine of autopoiesis. Their work began in 1970 while the first mention of cognitive biology by Brian Goodwin (discussed below) was in 1977 from a different perspective.Goodwin (1977), \\"Cognitive biology.\\" A copy of this four page paper is difficult to find. However, an eight page paper‚ÄîGoodwin (1978), ‚ÄúA cognitive view of biological process,‚Äù‚Äîis easy to procure and uses his own 1977 paper as a reference. A study of the other references in the ‚Äô78 paper suggests a unique perspective without mention of Maturana or Varela.  History  'Cognitive biology' first appeared in the literature as a paper with that title by Brian C. Goodwin in 1977.Goodwin (1977) \\"Cognitive biology.\\" There and in several related publicationsGoodwin 1976a, 1976b, and 1978. Goodwin explained the advantage of cognitive biology in the context of his work on morphogenesis. He subsequently moved on to other issues of structure, form, and complexity with little further mention of cognitive biology. Without an advocate, Goodwin's concept of cognitive biology has yet to gain widespread acceptance. Aside from an essay regarding Goodwin's conception by Margaret Boden in 1980, the next appearance of ‚Äòcognitive biology‚Äô as a phrase in the literature came in 1986 from a professor of biochemistry, Ladislav Kov√°ƒç. His conception, based on natural principles grounded in bioenergetics and molecular biology, is briefly discussed below. Kov√°ƒç's continued advocacy has had a greater influence in his homeland, Slovakia, than elsewhere partly because several of his most important papers were written and published only in Slovakian. By the 1990s, breakthroughs in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated a cornucopia of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Yet aside from the theorists already mentioned, no one was addressing cognitive biology except for Kov√°ƒç. = Kov√°ƒç‚Äôs cognitive biology = Ladislav Kov√°ƒç's ‚ÄúIntroduction to cognitive biology‚Äù (Kov√°ƒç, 1986a) lists ten ‚ÄòPrinciples of Cognitive Biology.‚Äô A closely related thirty page paper was published the following year: ‚ÄúOverview: Bioenergetics between chemistry, genetics and physics.‚Äù (Kov√°ƒç, 1987). Over the following decades, Kov√°ƒç elaborated, updated, and expanded these themes in frequent publications, including \\"Fundamental principles of cognitive biology\\" (Kov√°ƒç, 2000), ‚ÄúLife, chemistry, and cognition‚Äù (Kov√°ƒç, 2006a), \\"Information and Knowledge in Biology: Time for Reappraisal‚Äù (Kov√°ƒç, 2007) and \\"Bioenergetics: A key to brain and mind\\" (Kov√°ƒç, 2008).Although many of his publications are difficult to find, this URL has them all: .  Academic usage  = University seminar = The concept of cognitive biology is exemplified by this seminar description:The seminar, titled \\"Cognitive Biology,\\" was presented by Professor William Bechtel in the autumn of 2013 by the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. The seminar description was followed by the schedule for ten sessions and citations for the several papers to be discussed in each session. The papers cover cognitive aspects for a broad range of motile organisms, beginning with two regarding the cognitive abilities of bacteria. Over the course of ten sessions, the speakers include six biologists, two doctors of psychology, and two doctors of philosophy. The initial session featured the presentation of a paper titled to evoke discussion, \\"Bacterial Information Processing: Is It Cognition?\\" The paper‚Äôs author and host of the seminar sessions was William Bechtel, a philosopher of science who has written extensively on the philosophy and history of cognitive science. See for example Bechtel, W., Abrahamsen, A. and Graham, G. (1998), ‚ÄòThe life of cognitive science‚Äô, in ed. W. Bechtel and G.

Cambridge University Press. = University workgroup = The University of Adelaide has established a \\"Cognitive Biology\\" workgroup using this operating concept: Members of the group study the biological literature on simple organisms (e.g., nematode) in regard to cognitive process and look for homologues in more complex organisms (e.g., crow) already well studied. This comparative approach is expected to yield simple cognitive concepts common to all organisms. ‚ÄúIt is hoped a theoretically well-grounded toolkit of basic cognitive concepts will facilitate the use and discussion of research carried out in different fields to increase understanding of two foundational issues: what cognition is and what cognition does in the biological context.‚ÄùLyon, Pamela (2013a). ‚ÄúFoundations for a Cognitive Biology.‚Äù Published on the homepage of the Cognitive Biology Project at the University of Adelaide. http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/ (Bold letters from original text.) The group's choice of name, as they explain on a separate webpage, might have been ‚Äòembodied cognition‚ÄôThis option perpetuates a bias established by the original interdisciplinary grouping that formed the cognitive sciences in the 1970s: artificial intelligence, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, anthropology, and psychology. Clarification of cognition was slow in coming, even as computers and robots became more efficient. Some argued that a cognitive agent had to be embodied to interface with the world, thus excluding stationary computers. So a new member was added to the cognitive sciences, i.e., the science of embodied cognition. Both robot frogs and biological frogs were valid subjects for experiment. or ‚Äòbiological cognitive science.‚ÄôSuch a name implies that this is just another cognitive science, one among equals. But the group chose ‚Äòcognitive biology‚Äô for the sake of (i) emphasis and (ii) method. For the sake of emphasis, (i) ‚ÄúWe want to keep the focus on biology because for too long cognition was considered a function that could be almost entirely divorced from its physical instantiation, to the extent that whatever could be said of cognition almost by definition had to be applicable to both organisms and machines.‚Äù (ii) The method is to ‚Äúassume (if only for the sake of enquiry) that cognition is a biological function similar to other biological functions‚Äîsuch as respiration, nutrient circulation, waste elimination, and so on.‚ÄùLyon (2013b). ‚ÄúWhy Cognitive Biology?‚Äù http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/why/ . The method supposes that the genesis of cognition is biological, i.e., the method is biogenic. The host of the group's website has said elsewhereSee also Lyon and Opie (2007) ‚ÄúProlegomena for a cognitive biology.‚Äù that cognitive biology requires a biogenic approach, having identified ten principles of biogenesis in an earlier work.More detail can be found in Lyon (2006), ‚ÄúThe biogenic approach to cognition.‚Äù. The first four biogenic principles are quoted here to illustrate the depth at which the foundations have been set at the Adelaide school of cognitive biology: #‚ÄúComplex cognitive capacities have evolved from simpler forms of cognition. There is a continuous line of meaningful descent.‚Äù #‚ÄúCognition directly or indirectly modulates the physico-chemical-electrical processes that constitute an organism .‚Äù #‚ÄúCognition enables the establishment of reciprocal causal relations with an environment, leading to exchanges of matter and energy that are essential to the organism‚Äôs continued persistence, well-being or replication.‚Äù #‚ÄúCognition relates to the (more or less) continuous assessment of system needs relative to prevailing circumstances, the potential for interaction, and whether the current interaction is working or not.‚ÄùSee Lyon (2006), pps 15-20 for the principles quoted. = Other universities = As another example, the Department f√ºr KognitionsbiologieThis is the official website for the Department f√ºr Kognitionsbiologie: at the University of Vienna declares in its mission statement a strong commitment ‚Äúto experimental evaluation of multiple, testable hypotheses‚Äù regarding cognition in terms of evolutionary and developmental history as well as adaptive function and mechanism, whether the mechanism is cognitive, neural, and/or hormonal. ‚ÄúThe approach is strongly comparative: multiple species are studied, and compared within a rigorous phylogenetic framework, to understand the evolutionary history and adaptive function of cognitive mechanisms (‚Äòcognitive phylogenetics‚Äô).‚ÄùDepartment f√ºr Kognitionsbiologie COGBIO: Department of Cognitive Biology, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna, Austria Their website offers a sample of their work: ‚ÄúSocial Cognition and the Evolution of Language: Constructing Cognitive Phylogenies.‚Äù * A more restricted example can be found with the Cognitive Biology Group, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, Otto-von-Guericke University (OVGU) in Magdeburg, Germany.

Its website lists the papers generated from its lab work, focusing on the neural correlates of perceptual consequences and visual attention. The group's current work is aimed at detailing a dynamic known as ‚Äòmultistable perception.‚Äô The phenomenon, described in a sentence: ‚ÄúCertain visual displays are not perceived in a stable way but, from time to time and seemingly spontaneously, their appearance wavers and settles in a distinctly different form.‚ÄùResearch at the Cognitive Biology Group, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, OVGU (Otto- von-Guericke University) Magdeburg, Germany. * A final example of university commitment to cognitive biology can be found at Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia. There in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, the Bratislava Biocenter is presented as a consortium of research teams working in biomedical sciences. Their website lists the Center for Cognitive Biology in the Department of Biochemistry at the top of the page, followed by five lab groups, each at a separate department of bioscience. The webpage for the Center for Cognitive Biology http://www.biocenter.sk/welcome1a.html offers a link to \\"Foundations of Cognitive Biology,\\" a page that simply contains a quotation from a paper authored by Ladislav Kov√°ƒç, the site's founder. His perspective is briefly discussed below.  Cognitive biology as a category  The words ‚Äòcognitive‚Äô and ‚Äòbiology‚Äô are also used together as the name of a category. The category of cognitive biology has no fixed content but, rather, the content varies with the user. If the content can only be recruited from cognitive science, then cognitive biology would seem limited to a selection of items in the main set of sciences included by the interdisciplinary concept‚Äîcognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and cognitive anthropology.Named on page 143 in Miller, George A. \\"The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective.\\" Trends in cognitive sciences 7.3 (2003): 141-144. These six separate sciences were allied ‚Äúto bridge the gap between brain and mind‚Äù with an interdisciplinary approach in the mid-1970s.Named on page 143 in Miller, George A. \\"The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective.\\" Trends in cognitive sciences 7.3 (2003): 141-144. Participating scientists were concerned only with human cognition. As it gained momentum, the growth of cognitive science in subsequent decades seemed to offer a big tent to a variety of researchers.See first page of Von Eckardt, Barbara. What is cognitive science?. MIT press, 1995. Some, for example, considered evolutionary epistemology a fellow- traveler. Others appropriated the keyword, as for example Donald Griffin in 1978, when he advocated the establishment of cognitive ethology.Griffin, Donald R. \\"Prospects for a cognitive ethology.\\" Behavioral and Brain Sciences 1.04 (1978): 527-538. Meanwhile, breakthroughs in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated a cornucopia of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were problematic. For example, the decision to append cognitive to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named cognitive sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made‚Äîbetween the computational and constructivistStewart, J. (1996). Cognition = life: Implications for higher- level cognition.

Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. cognitive models‚Äîbefore appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of artificial life. One solution is to consider cognitive biology only as a subset of cognitive science. For example, a major publisher's website[55] WIRES (Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews) (2013). Wiley Online Library. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. http://wires.wiley.com/WileyCDA/ displays links to material in a dozen domains of major scientific endeavor. One of which is described thus: ‚ÄúCognitive science is the study of how the mind works, addressing cognitive functions such as perception and action, memory and learning, reasoning and problem solving, decision-making and consciousness.‚Äù Upon its selection from the display, the Cognitive Science page offers in nearly alphabetical order these topics: Cognitive Biology, Computer Science, Economics, Linguistics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Neuroscience. Linked through that list of topics, upon its selection the Cognitive Biology page offers a selection of reviews and articles with biological content ranging from cognitive ethologyFor consideration of cogbio v cogetho, see p23 in Kamil (1998), ‚ÄúOn the Proper Definition of Cognitive Ethology‚Äù. through evolutionary epistemology; cognition and art; evo-devo and cognitive science; animal learning; genes and cognition; cognition and animal welfare; etc. A different application of the cognitive biology category is manifest in the 2009 publication of papers presented at a three-day interdisciplinary workshop on ‚ÄúThe New Cognitive Sciences‚Äù held at the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research in 2006. The papers were listed under four headings, each representing a different domain of requisite cognitive ability: (i) space, (ii) qualities and objects, (iii) numbers and probabilities, and (iv) social entities. The workshop papers examined topics ranging from ‚ÄúAnimals as Natural Geometers‚Äù and ‚ÄúColor Generalization by Birds‚Äù through ‚ÄúEvolutionary Biology of Limited Attention‚Äù and ‚ÄúA comparative Perspective on the Origin of Numerical Thinking‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúNeuroethology of Attention in Primates‚Äù and ten more with less colorful titles. ‚Äú[O]n the last day of the workshop the participants agreed [that] the title ‚ÄòCognitive Biology‚Äô sounded like a potential candidate to capture the merging of the cognitive and the life sciences that the workshop aimed at representing.‚ÄùTommasi, et al., page x in Preface. See pps 3-11 for a discussion of cognitive science and biology. Thus the publication of Tommasi, et al. (2009), Cognitive Biology: Evolutionary and Developmental Perspectives on Mind, Brain and Behavior. A final example of categorical use comes from an author‚Äôs introduction to his 2011 publication on the subject, Cognitive Biology: Dealing with Information from Bacteria to Minds. After discussing the differences between the cognitive and biological sciences, as well as the value of one to the other, the author concludes: ‚ÄúThus, the object of this book should be considered as an attempt at building a new discipline, that of cognitive biology, which endeavors to bridge these two domains.‚ÄùAuthor‚Äôs italics, p2 in Auletta (2011), Cognitive biology: dealing with information from bacteria to minds. There follows a detailed methodology illustrated by examples in biology anchored by concepts from cybernetics (e.g., self- regulatory systems) and quantum information theory (regarding probabilistic changes of state) with an invitation \\"to consider system theory together with information theory as the formal tools that may ground biology and cognition as traditional mathematics grounds physics.‚ÄùAuletta (2011), p61.

He built her a new one, and for the next 15 years, he ran Tom Balding Bits & Spurs out of a repurposed mobile home. After that, the business expanded due to increased popularity from the endorsement of multiple National Reined Cow Horse Association (NRCHA) Snaffle Bit Champions such as Bobby Ingersoll. The business is now widely recognized throughout the world of western horsemanship. Metalwork Products The company handcrafts metalwork products and other items in Sheridan, Wyoming.

Smith wrote a self-deprecating poem on his skills, but there were several poems written and published about his exploits by others. :Loraine and Lord Maynard were there, and can tell :Who in Justice's scale holds the balance so well :As very good judges and justices too :The state of each horse, and what each man did do: :But if any one thinks he is quizzed in the song :And fancies his case stated legally wrong :To Enderby Hall let him go and complain :But he'll not mend his case, if he meets with Loraine. His skills as a horseman enabled him to sell horses for large sums. He sold one horse for three hundred pounds. Death, resurrection and death He was reputedly grateful for being in good health to his 85th year. Smith died on Sunday 23 August 1835 in his armchair. His celebrity was such that not only was a poem published in good humour about his imagined death many years before the event, but another poem which imagined his resurrection was written by Mr Heyrick in light-hearted reply. :Oh !how could you bury our neighbour so soon ! :Why, his boots were just black'd, and his fiddle in tune. :As a staunch, steady sportsman, and quite orthodox. :He'd been taking a glass to the hounds and the fox : :In his moments of mirth, he would sometimes drink deep ; :When you thought he was dead ‚Äî he was only asleep!

In a defamation lawsuit he was charged with breaking his distribution contract and disclosing proprietary information.Melilea contended that the distributors had violated various terms in their agreements with the company and had voluntarily resigned. While the newspaper and other defendants were found to be not guilty of defamation, judgment was rendered against Ong and the other two distributors.However, the plaintiff won the case against Ong on the merits of the case. Ong answered the complaint, but chose not to appear in court. The Surewin4u corporate website says that in 2008 Peter Ong launched a successful coffee shop franchise concept. That was the year that Peter Ong together with his brother Philip became involved with the Island Red Caf√© (Red Island Coffee) franchise business.

She had a No. 6 hit as a featured artist on Kylie Minogue's 1991 song \\"Shocked\\", and also participated in Big Brother: Power Trip in 2014. Career =Music= Bennett has taught dance since the age of 11 creating a nightclub performing group at aged 14. Her rap career began with her dance group The Brutal Ladies in 1984 and was the first female hip hop/jazz DJ on a local pirate radio station, playing local clubs until she entered the DMC Rap Championships in 1988 and was spotted by Les Adams a.k.a L.A. Mix. In 1989, she featured on L.A. Mix's UK No. 25 hit \\"Get Loose\\", which became a hit after L.A. Mix had been diagnosed by Stock, Aitken and Waterman as being \\"unlikely to score another hit\\" after their UK #6 hit \\"Check This Out\\". The following year, she had a solo hit with \\"Feel the Rhythm\\", which charted at No. 51 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1991, Jazzi rapped on the DNA song \\"Rebel Woman\\", which sampled David Bowie's \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and charted at No. 42 on the same chart. Around the same time, DNA remixed Kylie Minogue's \\"Shocked\\" and added a rap part written and performed by Jazzi. The DNA Remix of the song was then released as a single (it was not originally planned for release) and charted at No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Minogue's thirteenth consecutive top ten hit. Jazzi also performed the track on Top of the Pops. Jazzi told Minogue that previously she thought the singer's music was \\"shit\\". What they failed to report was the remainder of the comment which was \\"...but since I've seen and heard you perform live, hip hop or no hip hop cred, I would pay to see you any day!\\". Many house tracks have used Jazzi's a cappellas for remixes and in 1994 Chris & James sampled \\"Feel the Rhythm\\" for their UK No. 74 hit \\"Calm Down (Bass Keeps Pumpin')\\". In 1991 after buying herself out of her record deal, she returned to teaching dance and building Wolverhampton's first community dance studio, Sweatbox. =2014: Big Brother= Bennett participated in the fifteenth series of Big Brother UK, entering on Day 1 on 5 June 2014; she declared herself \\"an opinionated joker\\" and it was mis-stated that she had phobias of sea creatures and red meat. Her motto is \\"if it swims or flies I'll eat it, but if it goes clip clop, I'll think twice\\" She also noted that if she was not the first one to be evicted, she would be celebrating her fiftieth birthday in the house. She became the first housemate to be voted 'Power' housemate, enabling her to influence events; she was immediately asked to select one housemate for a treat and one for a punishment. She selected Mark for the treat ‚Äì a ¬£5,000 cash bonus ‚Äì and selected Matthew for a punishment because she disagreed with some remarks he made about people with little intelligence. Matthew's punishment was to be excluded from the house for the first night. The next day, Bennett was asked to send a single housemate straight through to the final; she selected Helen. On Day 4, she was asked to hand out a Big Brother 'killer nomination', which meant that the selected housemate would automatically face eviction every week for the whole time they were in the house. She selected Jale on the grounds that she did not like her ways feeling that she was selfish and not a team player. Upon selecting her killer nomination, Bennett's tenure as Power housemate expired and fellow housemate Chris was selected; he nominated Pauline for the next eviction. A few days later, she had to be rushed to hospital to be treated for a burn. She became the second housemate to be evicted on Day 16 (with 79.4% of the public vote).
