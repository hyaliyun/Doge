He was born on April 10, 1843 in the town of Jamboti in Belgaum District. He graduated in 1864 from Elphinstone High School in Mumbai, and started teaching in the same school three years later. In 1888, he assumed the headmaster's position in the Anglo-vernacular High School in Hubli, and moved on four years later to be an assistant deputy educational inspector for Belagaum district. In 1867, Gunjikar became the first editor of the monthly Wiwidha Dnyan Wistar (‡§µ‡§ø‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§µ‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§∞) which was founded with the objective of disseminating information on varied topics, including sciences, biographies, literary criticisms, and philosophical/ethical ideas. He stayed in that position for seven years to turn the magazine into a prestigious monthly. His proficiency in Sanskrit, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Bengali, and English languages helped him in his editorial and literary works. His articles included ones on Marathi poetry, Marathi grammar, and Marathi as a language. He also invented a Marathi shorthand script. Gunjikar became the first historic novelist in Marathi literature when he wrote the novel Mochangad (‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ö‡§®‡§ó‡§°) in 1871. The novel vividly describes life in Maharashtra in the first half of the 17th century.

In 1990, Balasuriya published the book Mary and Human Liberation. In 1994, the Sri Lankan bishops warned that the book included heretical content because it misrepresented the doctrine of original sin and cast serious doubts on the divinity of Christ. Balasuriya submitted a 55-page theological defense to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which rejected it.  Doctrinal investigation  In May 1996, the Congregation demanded that he sign a profession of faith, apparently written exclusively for him, stating that he would \\"adhere with religious submission of will and intellect to the teachings of the Roman pontiff,\\" even those teachings not proclaimed as definitive.  Excommunication  Balasuriya responded by signing a different profession of faith composed by Pope Paul VI, adding a caveat that he was signing it \\"in the context of theological development and church practice since Vatican II and the freedom and responsibility of Christians and theological searchers under canon law.\\" Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ruled that the caveat rendered the profession \\"defective.\\" Balasuriya appealed directly to the Pope, but was excommunicated on 2 January 1997, with the Pope's approval. = Lifting of excommunication = Balasuriya then appealed to the Apostolic Signatura but was told that his case could not go forward. He subsequently agreed to drop the caveat from his profession of faith, and after intense international publicity and six days of negotiations, the excommunication was rescinded in January 1998. Although Balasuriya did not admit to doctrinal error, he did acknowledge \\"perceptions of error\\" and agreed to submit all future writings to his bishops for the imprimatur.  Death  Balasuriya died in Colombo on January 17, 2013, aged 89. He had been suffering from illness for some time.

Plot Shy and naive mountain trapper Yancy (Audie Murphy) travels through Wyoming with his uncle and his Indian wife. After Uncle Lije (George Mitchell) is injured by a bear, Yancy is sent to trade their beaver pelts for money and supplies. When he arrives at the trading post, he finds it has been burnt down by an Indian who was sold moonshine by a lazy sneak thief, Ben Stocker (Strother Martin). The trading post owner tells Yancy that he will have to ride two more days to Casper, Wyoming, the nearest town to trade his furs. Stocker tries to trade his oldest daughter Rosalie (Sandra Dee) to Yancy for some furs, but is rebuffed. The next day, Yancy finds that Rosalie has run away from her father and wants him to take her to town. When they reach the town and he trades his furs, Yancy gets Rosalie some new clothes so she will be presentable to look for a job. Paul Bartell (Gilbert Roland), the town's corrupt sheriff, says he will find Rosalie a job at the dance hall, and Yancy believes that this will be alright. He later finds out what really goes on at the dance hall and goes to get Rosalie. Bartell, who intends to earn good money with Rosalie, refuses to let the girl go, and Yancy is forced to shoot him in self-defense.

At this time it was new to the even broader field of art cinema.

London: British Film Institute. are also not needed. Instead, we may have the protagonist wander around aimlessly for the whole movie, with nothing of real importance happening to drive him from one activity to the other. Classical Hollywood cinema has a narrative transitivity, in which there is \\"a sequence of events in which each unit follows the one preceding it according to a chain of causation; this chain is usually psychological\\".Wollen, P. (1982). Godard and Counter-Cinema: Vent d'est, 80. Semiotic Counter- Strategies: Readings and Writings London: Verso The 'tale over teller' mantra of the classical Hollywood cinema is closely linked to the editing form that classical Hollywood cinema takes, and the rules they impose. For example, the 180 degree rule is followed since crossing the 180 degree line will cause a disturbance or a jarring effect on the viewer, thus calling attention away from story and to the teller. Jump cuts are avoided, since they can cause an ellipsis of the spatial or temporal kind. It is the job of classical Hollywood cinema to get the audience lost and absorbed into the story of the film, so that the film is pleasurable. In contrast the task of European art cinema is to be ambiguous, utilizing an open-ended (and sometimes intertextual) plot, causing the audience to ask questions themselves whilst introducing an element of subjectivity.Wollen, P. (1982). Godard and Counter-Cinema: Vent d'est, 85. Semiotic Counter-Strategies: Readings and Writings London: Verso Another way they differ in terms of ‚Äòrealism‚Äô is that Hollywood classical cinema has characters in full make up all the time, even when just coming out of bed; whereas European art cinema strives for a representation of the 'truth' and may not have characters in costume or make up.Wollen, P.

The definition typically involves a Hilbert space, an algebra of operators on it and an unbounded self-adjoint operator, endowed with supplemental structures. It was conceived by Alain Connes who was motivated by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem and sought its extension to 'noncommutative' spaces. Some authors refer to this notion as unbounded K-cycles or as unbounded Fredholm modules.  Motivation  A motivating example of spectral triple is given by the algebra of smooth functions on a compact spin manifold, acting on the Hilbert space of L2-spinors, accompanied by the Dirac operator associated to the spin structure. From the knowledge of these objects one is able to recover the original manifold as a metric space: the manifold as a topological space is recovered as the spectrum of the algebra, while the (absolute value of) Dirac operator retains the metric.A. Connes, Noncommutative Geometry, Academic Press, 1994 On the other hand, the phase part of the Dirac operator, in conjunction with the algebra of functions, gives a K-cycle which encodes index-theoretic information. The local index formulaA. Connes, H. Moscovici; The Local Index Formula in Noncommutative Geometry expresses the pairing of the K-group of the manifold with this K-cycle in two ways: the 'analytic/global' side involves the usual trace on the Hilbert space and commutators of functions with the phase operator (which corresponds to the 'index' part of the index theorem), while the 'geometric/local' side involves the Dixmier trace and commutators with the Dirac operator (which corresponds to the 'characteristic class integration' part of the index theorem). Extensions of the index theorem can be considered in cases, typically when one has an action of a group on the manifold, or when the manifold is endowed with a foliation structure, among others. In those cases the algebraic system of the 'functions' which expresses the underlying geometric object is no longer commutative, but one may able to find the space of square integrable spinors (or, sections of a Clifford module) on which the algebra acts, and the corresponding 'Dirac' operator on it satisfying certain boundedness of commutators implied by the pseudo-differential calculus.  Definition  An odd spectral triple is a triple (A, H, D) consisting of a Hilbert space H, an algebra A of operators on H (usually closed under taking adjoints) and a densely defined self adjoint operator D satisfying ‚Äñ[a, D]‚Äñ < ‚àû for any a ‚àà A. An even spectral triple is an odd spectral triple with a Z/2Z-grading on H, such that the elements in A are even while D is odd with respect to this grading. One could also say that an even spectral triple is given by a quartet (A, H, D, Œ≥) such that Œ≥ is a self adjoint unitary on H satisfying a Œ≥ = Œ≥ a for any a in A and D Œ≥ = - Œ≥ D. A finitely summable spectral triple is a spectral triple (A, H, D) such that a.D for any a in A has a compact resolvent which belongs to the class of Lp+-operators for a fixed p (when A contains the identity operator on H, it is enough to require D‚àí1 in Lp+(H)). When this condition is satisfied, the triple (A, H, D) is said to be p-summable. A spectral triple is said to be Œ∏-summable when e‚àítD2 is of trace class for any t > 0. Let Œ¥(T) denote the commutator of D with an operator T on H. A spectral triple is said to be regular when the elements in A and the operators of the form [a, D] for a in A are in the domain of the iterates Œ¥n of Œ¥. When a spectral triple (A, H, D) is p-summable, one may define its zeta function Œ∂D(s) = Tr(D‚àís); more generally there are zeta functions Œ∂b(s) = Tr(bD‚àís) for each element b in the algebra B generated by Œ¥n(A) and Œ¥n([a, D]) for positive integers n. They are related to the heat kernel exp(-tD) by a Mellin transform. The collection of the poles of the analytic continuation of Œ∂b for b in B is called the dimension spectrum of (A, H, D). A real spectral triple is a spectral triple (A, H, D) accompanied with an anti-linear involution J on H, satisfying [a, JbJ] = 0 for a, b in A. In the even case it is usually assumed that J is even with respect to the grading on H.  Important concepts  Given a spectral triple (A, H, D), one can apply several important operations to it. The most fundamental one is the polar decomposition D = FD of D into a self adjoint unitary operator F (the 'phase' of D) and a densely defined positive operator D (the 'metric' part). = Metric on the pure state space = The positive D operator defines a metric on the set of pure states on the norm closure of A. = Pairing with K-theory = The self adjoint unitary F gives a map of the K-theory of A into integers by taking Fredholm index as follows. In the even case, each projection e in A decomposes as e0 ‚äï e1 under the grading and e1Fe0 becomes a Fredholm operator from e0H to e1H. Thus e ‚Üí Ind e1Fe0 defines an additive mapping of K0(A) to Z. In the odd case the eigenspace decomposition of F gives a grading on H, and each invertible element in A gives a Fredholm operator (F + 1) u (F ‚àí 1)/4 from (F ‚àí 1)H to (F + 1)H. Thus u ‚Üí Ind (F + 1) u (F ‚àí 1)/4 gives an additive mapping from K1(A) to Z. When the spectral triple is finitely summable, one may write the above indexes using the (super) trace, and a product of F, e (resp. u) and commutator of F with e (resp. u). This can be encoded as a (p + 1)-functional on A satisfying some algebraic conditions and give Hochschild / cyclic cohomology cocycles, which describe the above maps from K-theory to the integers.

Originating as a joint venture between engineer/amusement park developer Frederick Ingersoll and Indianapolis businessmen J. Clyde Power, Albert Lieber, and Bert Fiebleman and Emmett Johnson,David J. Bodenhamer, Robert Graham Barrows, and David Gordon Vanderstel, The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis (Indiana University Press 1994) the park was built by Ingersoll's Pittsburgh Construction Company adjacent to Riverside City Park at West 30th Street between White River and the Central Canal in the Riverside subdivision of Indianapolis.Indianapolis Amusement Parks 1903-1911: Landscapes on the Edge - Connie J. Zeigler, Indiana University 2007 History =Formation and early years= On 6 January 1903, incorporation papers were filed for Riverside Amusement Company with the State of Indiana. The list of company directors included William Jineson (of Charleroi, Pennsylvania), Elmore E. Gregg and Frederick Ingersoll (both of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), J. Clyde Power and Albert Leiber (both of Indianapolis).Riverside Amusement Company incorporation papers, cited in Indianapolis Amusement Parks 1903-1911: Landscapes on the Edge - Connie J. Zeigler, Indiana University 2007 The following May, the park opened and was an immediate success. One of Ingersoll's signature figure 8 roller coasters was one of several attractions pulling in the crowds in the park's early days;\\"What parks will offer this summer\\", Indianapolis News, 2 May 1903, cited in Indianapolis Amusement Parks 1903-1911: Landscapes on the Edge - Connie J. Zeigler, Indiana University 2007 another was a looking-glass maze. The park's first manager, Frank P. Thomas, Sr., decided not to charge an admission fee for entry onto the grounds, opting to charge the patrons by the individual ride (5 cents for the \\"double-eight tobaggan railway\\", for example). Despite Ingersoll's turning his attention away from Riverside Amusement Park and toward his plans for Rocky Glen Park and Indianola Park (with his Luna Parks only two years into the future), Power (himself an engineer) and the directors of the Riverside Amusement Company quickly added an Old Mill ride in which boats were ridden through a darkened tunnel into a replica of a working flour mill. In 1906, J.S. Sandy became the new manager and hired 120 men to expand and update the park.\\"Many improvements in Indianapolis park, Indianapolis Star, 6 May 1906, cited in Indianapolis Amusement Parks 1903-1911: Landscapes on the Edge - Connie J. Zeigler, Indiana University 2007 Live entertainment added to the throngs as Sandy arranged for increased streetcar service into the park. On 6 May 1906, opening day for the park's fourth season, approximately 30,000 people visited the park (one-fifth the population of Indianapolis at the time), according to Sandy. Two weeks later, a second competing amusement park, Wonderland, opened its gates to the public. By the end of the year another, White City, opened along the White River, north of the Indianapolis city limit. The three-way rivalry involving Riverside Amusement Park, Wonderland, and White City intensified over the next two years (White City was destroyed by fire 26 June 1908;\\"White City amusement park destroyed by fire\\", Indianapolis Star 27 June 1908, cited in Indianapolis Amusement Parks 1903-1911: Landscapes on the Edge - Connie J.

Zeigler, Indiana University 2007). Attractions and rides were being added in an increasing rate: an \\"aerial swing,\\" a Japanese bowling alley, a \\"Gee Whiz\\",which Sandy described as \\"a cross between a giant teeter-totter and a flying jinny\\", cited in Indianapolis Amusement Parks 1903-1911: Landscapes on the Edge - Connie J. Zeigler, Indiana University 2007 an electric carousel, a miniature railway, various arcade and carnival games... and a massive (350 feet long) shoot-the-chutes ride. Each new ride was bedecked with lighting similar to that of the Luna Parks (not only of Coney Island but also Ingersoll's burgeoning empire in Cleveland and Pittsburgh). Riverside Amusement Park also benefitted from the increased popularity of its skating rink, dancing pavilion, canoes, and rowboats - each generating revenues as the park's new rivals spent thousands of dollars with new attractions and rides.\\"Big steer at Riverside\\", Indianapolis Star, 7 June 1908, cited in Indianapolis Amusement Parks 1903-1911: Landscapes on the Edge - Connie J. Zeigler, Indiana University 2007 The last notable addition under the aegis of J.S. Sandy (as mechanical rides were rapidly declining in popularity) was the bathing beach (with a six-story-tall diving tower), opened in 1910. =Ownership change= In 1919, the park had new ownership. Lewis Coleman, a lawyer who provided legal advice to the Riverside Amusement Company and took payment in the form of company stock, organized the Riverside Exhibition Company and gained control of the park. With Coleman as president, the park added two large roller coasters (The Flash and The Thriller), installed Dodgem cars (a forerunner of today's bumper cars),The Salisbury Beach Dodgem: A Smashing Ride (1920-1980) - Betsy H. Woodham replaced the miniature railroad with a longer one, expanded the dancing pavilion and converted it into a roller skating rink, and housed the games and concessions in new concrete buildings.UNWA - Polis Center The additional investments reversed the park's trend in declining attendance over the previous decade (this trend was mirrored nationally as amusement park after amusement park ceased to exist after the initial first-decade-of-the-new-century boom). Lewis also instituted a \\"whites only\\" policy in the park, permitting African Americans access to the park only on designated days.Paul A. Shackel and Erve Chambers, Places in Mind: Public Archaeology as Applied Anthropology (Routledge 2004) - once a year, the park would have \\"Colored Frolic Day\\" (a.k.a. \\"Milk Cap Day\\") in which African Americans were permitted to enter the park upon presentation of milk bottle caps.Sandy Eisenberg Sasso, Kim Charles Ferrill, and Tess Baker, Urban Tapestry: Indianapolis Stories (Indiana University Press 2002) http://www.iupui.edu/~anthpm/WACgalleyfinal.pdf \\"Racializing the Commonplace Landscape: An Archaeology of Urban Renewal Along the Color Line\\"] Paul R. Mullins, World Archaeology, Vol. 38(1), p.60-71 It would remain in effect for almost 50 years. In 1939, control of the park was passed from Lewis Coleman to his son, John. The younger Coleman kept the park alive through the World War II years by sponsoring wartime relief programs to military families and emphasizing patriotism in his park's publicity. Riverside Amusement Park's attendance increased after the end of World War II and the return of the region's troops to their home. The residents of Indianapolis gained in mobility (due to greater availability of motor transportation) and in leisure activity. An estimated one million people visited the park's midway and skating rink in 1952. By the end of the decade, Coleman added new attractions and rides, including one that became popular in the newly opened Disneyland, an automobile turnpike ride. Ironically, theme parks like Disneyland and the private automobile also proved to be two major contributors to the demise of the park less than two decades later. =Demise of the park= The decade of the 1960s was not a kind one for Riverside Amusement Park, which was losing attendance for the first time since the end of World War II. By the time John Coleman lifted the \\"whites only\\" policy (in response to a series of protests organized by the NAACP Youth Council in 1963),Digital Image Library - Indiana Historical Society the park was losing $30,000 a year. Increased cost of insurance, maintenance, and new rides, coupled with increased competition from the emerging theme parks, were cited by Coleman as the park closed for the last time at the end of the 1970 season. All the rides were sold or demolished by 1978.Eric B.

Development Think Fast was first announced at Disney's Press Release on July 31, 2008. Disney promised the game to be a family favourite party game for the holiday season. The PlayStation 2 version is bundled with a set of Buzz! buzzers, while the Wii version utilises the Wii Remote and Nunchuk as buzzers.Disney Interactive Studios Announces Game Show-Style Trivia Game, Disney TH!NK Fast - The Disney-themed title for Wii and PlayStation 2 will test players' mental and physical reflexes while providing hours of family fun.

IGN. October 30, 2008. Reception Reviews for the Wii version of the game have been mixed as Jack DeVries of IGN gave the game a 5.5/10 and stated \\"Disney's Think Fast has a nice presentation that combines some classic and popular Disney franchises. And while it's not original, the Buzz games are decent games to copy for a license title. However, the overly simple questions limit the game to only very young children. More importantly, the game repeats questions and has delayed controls that mess up the very nature of a quiz game. If there are some major Disney movie fans in your household this game might be entertaining for a round or two, but you're way better off getting something like the Disney branded Scene It or Trivial Pursuit games.\\"Disney TH!NK Fast Review, IGN Austin Light of GameSpot, who gave the game a 5/10, stated: \\"This family- friendly trivia game is fun while it lasts, but its mostly easy questions are repeated far too frequently.\\"Disney TH!NK Fast Review, Gamespot. Harold Goldberg of Common Sense Media, however, gave the game four stars and an on rating for ages 6 and up, and praised the game's educational value and messages about being smart, though warned parents about mild cartoon violence in some of the film clips in the game.Common Sense Media Review The PlayStation 2 version of the game, however, did receive positive reviews. Brian Dumlao of Worth playing, who gave the game a 7.7/10, said that the game's questions are \\"of the right difficulty level and the presentation, while not perfect, is good enough so that fans won't feel like they were given a bare-bones effort.\\". Brian stated \\"Disney TH!NK Fast challenges players to think fast in a new game show-style quiz game that will test players‚Äô Disney and general knowledge, promising to be a family favourite party game this holiday season.\\"Worthplaying Review Micky Gunn of Gameplanet gave the game a 7.5/10. Although the game was criticized its lack of challenge for anyone older than ten, the game was praised for its selection of Disney films and characters and extremely simple gameplay with a variety of fast-paced rounds.Game Planet Review References External links *Official Site *Gamespot profile Category:2008 video games Category:Donald Duck video games Category:Mickey Mouse video games Category:Wii games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Goofy (Disney) video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Disney video games ","title":"Disney Think Fast"},{"id":"23856973","text":"Tiberius Julius Sauromates IV, also known as Sauromates IV (, flourished 3rd century ‚Äì died 276) was a prince and Roman Client King of the Bosporan Kingdom.

Crist√≥v√£o Ferreira (c. 1580-1650) was a Portuguese Catholic priest and Jesuit missionary who committed apostasy after being captured and tortured during the anti-Christian purges in 17th-century Japan. During the Tokugawa shogunate, Christian missionaries and their Japanese followers were persecuted, arrested and executed. Authorities were concerned that the religion was making followers loyal to Jesus rather than the Emperor or the Shogunate. After Ferreira had renounced his faith, he remained in Japan for the rest of his life. He became known as one of the \\"fallen priests\\" who assisted Japanese authorities with their knowledge of Western philosophies and sciences. Early life and career Born around 1580, in Torres Vedras, Portugal, Ferreira was sent to Asia, where he was a missionary from 1609 to 1633 in Japan, which was then ruled by the Tokugawa shogunate. Apostate In 1633, Ferreira was captured and renounced Christianity after being tortured for five hours. He became the most famous of the \\"fallen priests\\" and changed his name to Sawano Ch≈´an (Japanese: Ê≤¢ÈáéÂø†Â∫µ). He registered at a Buddhist temple in accordance with Japanese law, and called himself \\"a member of the Zen sect\\", but his own publications attest that he adopted a philosophy of natural law:Cieslik, Hubert (1973). \\"The Case of Christov√£o Ferreira \\". Monumenta Nipponica 29 :Hubert Cieslik writes: Life after apostasy After his apostasy he married a Japanese woman and wrote several books, including treatises on Western astronomy and medicine, which became widely distributed in the Edo period. He also is alleged to have privately written a book on religion entitled „ÄåÈ°ïÂÅΩÈå≤„Äç (The Deception Revealed) in 1636, but it was not published for 300 years and there is some controversy concerning who wrote it. He participated in government trials of other captured Jesuits.The making of an enterprise: the Society of Jesus in Portugal, its empire, and beyond, 1540-1750, Dauril Alden, Stanford University Press, 1996, p. 136 He was often present during the use of fumi-e, whereby suspected Christians were ordered to trample on an image of Jesus Christ.

Seen in tropical, sub-tropical and warm temperate rainforests, often in gullies. Occasionally it grows in cooler situations such as at Monga National Park. The range of natural distribution is from Orbost (37¬∞ S) in the state of Victoria up the east coast of New South Wales to the Atherton Tableland (17¬∞ S) in tropical Queensland. Description A small to medium-sized tree, up to 30 metres tall and 80 cm in diameter. Usually much smaller, particularly in New South Wales where it is mostly seen between 6 and 12 metres in height. In Victoria it can grow to 22 metres high, with a trunk diameter of 57 cm. The trunk is straight and cylindrical, without buttresses or fluting. The bark is fairly smooth; dark brown in colour. Sometimes with vertical rows of bumps. Flaking plates of bark and vertical cracks may be seen on larger trees. =Leaves= Leaves alternate, firm, heavy and toothed, but not toothed at the base. The leaf serration is more evident and more widely spaced than in the white hazelwood. The leathery leaves \\"rattle\\" together when a branch is shaken. The leaf shape is elliptic or wide lanceolate 12 to 18 cm long to a short leaf tip. Leaf venation is easily noticed, particularly on the underside. Net veins are not clearly evident above the leaf, better seen under the leaf. The paler coloured midrib is sunken on the top leaf surface, and raised under the leaf. The leaf stalk is 10 to 15 mm long, flattened on the top side and but rounded underneath. =Flowers and fruit= The greenish white flowers form on racemes; occasionally the flowers turn bluish-black. Flowering occurs between the months of September to December, although these trees may flower at other times such as between May to June. Flowers are relatively large, 9 to 15 mm long, giving rise to an alternative common name large-flowered hazelwood. Another distinguishing feature is that the flowers of the similar white hazelwood are on panicles, not racemes as is the case in this species. The fruit is a drupe, 12 to 14 mm long, purplish-black and egg- shaped, maturing in January to March. The five sepals persist on the fruit, but not the floral bracts. The fruit is eaten by the green catbird. Fresh seed should be used for regeneration, after the removal of the aril.

It was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Freedom received general acclaim from book critics, and was ranked one of the best books of 2010 by several publications, and has been described as a \\"Great American Novel\\". The novel follows the lives of the Berglund family, particularly the parents Patty and Walter, as their lives develop and then their happiness falls apart. Important to their story is a college friend of Walter's and successful rock musician, Richard Katz, who has a love affair with Patty. Walter and Patty's son, Joey, also goes through his own coming of age challenges. Franzen began working on the novel in 2001, following his successful novel The Corrections. The title of the novel was an artifact of his book proposal, where he wanted to write a novel that freed him from the constraints of his previous work. The cover of many editions of the novel includes a cerulean warbler, a songbird, for which Walter works to create an environmental preserve. Plot =Good Neighbors= The novel opens with a brief look at the Berglund family during their time living in St. Paul, Minnesota, from the perspective of their nosy neighbors. The Berglunds are portrayed as an ideal liberal and middle-class family, and they are among the first families to move into urban St. Paul after years of white flight to the suburbs. Patty Berglund is a charming and youthful homemaker with a self-deprecating sense of humor; her husband Walter is a mild-mannered but principled lawyer with environmentalist advocacies. They have one daughter, Jessica, and one son, Joey, the latter exhibiting a precocious independence and talent for making money. Joey becomes sexually involved with a neighborhood teen named Connie Monaghan and begins to rebel against his mother, going so far as to move in with Connie and her family, making Patty and Walter increasingly unstable. After many unhappy years, and after both Joey and Jessica have gone off to college, Patty and Walter relocate to Washington, D.C., abandoning the neighborhood and house they have worked so hard to improve. =Mistakes Were Made= The second section of the novel is a story-within-a-story, presented as an autobiography written by Patty at her therapist's suggestion. She recalls her youth as a star basketball player, her alienation from her busy Democrat parents and artistically-inclined siblings, and her being date-raped. Instead of attending an East Coast elite college like her siblings, she obtains a varsity scholarship to the University of Minnesota, where she continues her successful basketball career. Through her best friend at the time, a possessive and disturbed girl named Eliza, she meets an attractive indie rock musician named Richard Katz, and his nerdy but kind roommate, Walter Berglund. Shortly after finally detaching herself from Eliza, Patty suffers a career-ending knee injury, and attempts to woo Richard on a road trip to New York. Failing to do so, she settles down with Walter, who has been patiently courting her for more than a year. Despite being happy with Walter and raising a family with him, Patty is unable to forget her physical attraction to Richard. As a result, nearly twenty years after college, she betrays Walter in a brief affair with Richard during a stay at the Berglunds' vacation house, located on an unnamed lake in Minnesota. She learns that Richard denied her advances decades earlier out of respect for his best friend Walter. =2004= The third section of the novel jumps to the early 2000s, and alternates in viewpoint among Richard, Joey, and Walter. By 2004, a middle-aged Richard has finally found success as a minor indie rock star, with his breakthrough album Nameless Lake having been secretly inspired by his affair. Uncomfortable with commercial success, he burns through his new-found money. Walter, who has been working in Washington, D.C. for an unorthodox environmental organization called the Cerulean Mountain Trust, calls him to enlist his help for a personal project. Richard learns that the Trust is funded by a coal mining magnate who wants to strip mine a section of West Virginia territory before turning it into a preserve for the cerulean warbler, a songbird. Walter hopes to use some of the Trust's funding for his pet project, a campaign against human overpopulation. Believing that Richard's rock star reputation could greatly help the campaign, Walter meets up with him, and introduces him to Walter's beautiful young assistant, Lalitha. Richard notices that Lalitha appears to be deeply in love with Walter, and also learns from Walter that his marriage with Patty, who has been suffering from depression, is deteriorating. After navigating many difficulties in relocating obstinate West Virginian families living on the proposed preserve territory, including convincing a body-armor manufacturer for the Iraq War, which Walter greatly opposes, to employ the displaced families, Walter and Lalitha complete the deals required to set up the future warbler preserve. After drinking for the first time in his life, Walter inadvertently declares his love for Lalitha, and they kiss, but stop short of having sex. Now able to use funding for the anti-overpopulation campaign, which they name Free Space, Walter invites Richard back to Washington D.C.. While attempting to show interest in the initiative, Richard reaches out to Patty, and tries to convince her to leave Walter and let him be happy. Patty refuses, and shows Richard the autobiography she wrote as therapy (‚ÄòMistakes Were Made‚Äô), trying to convince him that she still loves Walter. After reading it, Richard deliberately leaves the manuscript on Walter's desk for him to see. Hurt and enraged, Walter throws Patty out despite her claims that her affair with Richard is done and that she loves him. Lonely and directionless, Patty goes to Jersey City to live with Richard. Meanwhile, the Berglunds' estranged son, Joey, now studies at the University of Virginia. He initially finds his new life unsatisfactory compared to his younger years in Minnesota; he blames the September 11 attacks and its effects on the people around him. His attempts to break away from his childhood sweetheart Connie fail when he finds himself seeking their intimacy. However, after a Thanksgiving at his roommate Jonathan's family in the D.C. suburbs, Joey meets Jonathan's exceptionally beautiful but mischievous sister Jenna, and is exposed to their father's Zionist politics, which along with increased involvement with neo- conservatives, further alienate Joey from his father. Through Jonathan's father's connections, Joey meets Kenny Bartles, an entrepreneur determined to profit from the ongoing Iraq War. Kenny is subcontracted by LBI for a highly lucrative Department of Defense project, to procure supply trucks to serve in the frontlines. Kenny convinces Joey to invest a large amount up-front, only for Joey to discover that Kenny has dubiously chosen an obsolete truck model for the deal. At home in Minnesota, Connie suffers from depression, which is worsened by Joey's distant treatment of her. Joey impulsively marries her after she gives him her savings to invest in the subcontract, although he keeps the marriage secret from everyone, especially his parents. However, Joey continues to flirt with Jenna, and during a trip to South America is given a chance to sleep with her; during the act, he unexpectedly suffers impotence, and realizes his true love for Connie. His ensuing exploits in finding truck parts in South America are disastrous, and he is pressured to ship defective parts to fulfill his contract, causing him extreme guilt, which leads him to call his father for advice. Walter is proud of Joey's show of conscience, and Joey decides not to blow the whistle, instead donating much of the proceeds from his subcontract. He also eventually tells both parents about having married Connie, who now happily lives with him. With Patty gone, Walter and Lalitha become lovers. However, increasingly depressive after his separation from Patty, Walter loses his temper on live TV at the inauguration of the new West Virginian body-armor factory, expressing his contempt for the displaced families and the Trust's corporate backers. He and Lalitha get fired as a result, and are forced to continue the Free Space initiative without the Trust's help, though Walter's speech leads him to become an icon for radicals across the country. They plan a large concert to raise awareness, but without Richard and the Trust the event becomes an echo chamber for already- radicalized youth. While on a road trip with Walter to visit campgrounds across the nation before the concert, Lalitha leaves early to manage the increasing destructiveness of concert attendees, and is killed in a car crash. =Mistakes Were Made (Conclusion)= The penultimate section of the novel is a follow-up chapter to Patty's autobiography, written specifically for Walter. Patty reveals that she has not talked to Walter for six years. She lasted only several months living with Richard, aware of their long-term incompatibility. For several months after her split with Richard, Patty stays with her college basketball friends, until her father was suddenly diagnosed with cancer. After traveling home to see him again in his final days, Patty visits each of her siblings to negotiate a compromise in the family's heated squabbles over the estate, and gradually redeems her relationship with her family, little though any of them agree with one another. Patty then lives alone in Brooklyn and works at a private school, where she found a passion for teaching and coaching young children. She relates that Joey has been successful in a new sustainable coffee business, while Jessica has focused on a career in publishing, and that Patty's separation from Walter has caused the siblings to become closer to each other despite their differences. Six years after she left Walter, Patty runs into Richard, who is now comfortable with his success. Richard convinces Patty to get in touch with Walter, saying she's good at telling stories, and this motivates her to write a concluding chapter to her autobiography. =Canterbridge Estates Lake= After Lalitha's death, Walter retreats to his family's lakeside house in Minnesota, where the previously unnamed lake has been renamed Canterbridge Estates Lake after a new residential development built across the water from Walter's house. His new neighbors see him as a cranky recluse, obsessed with preventing their house cats from killing birds nesting on his property. One day, Walter, who did not read the manuscript Patty sent him, finds her on the steps of the lakeside house. Despite his rage and confusion, he eventually takes her back, and they rekindle their relationship slowly, spending all of their time together. Patty quickly earns the admiration of Walter's neighbors, but after less than a year, she and Walter move out, returning to her job in New York, where most of her family and their friends also live. According to Walter's wishes, the old lakeside house is turned into a fenced, cat-proof bird sanctuary, named in memory of Lalitha. Development After the critical acclaim and popular success of his third novel The Corrections in 2001, Franzen began work on his fourth full- length novel. When asked during an October 30, 2002 interview on Charlie Rose how far he was into writing the new novel, Franzen replied: > I'm about a year of frustration and confusion into it...Y'know, I'm kind of > down at the bottom of the submerged iceberg peering up for the surface of > the water...I don't have doubt about my ability to write a good book, but I > have lots of doubt about what it's going to look like.\\"An interview with > Jonathan Franzen\\" , October 30, 2002 interview on Charlie Rose Show Franzen went on to suggest that a basic story outline was in place, and that his writing of the new novel was like a \\"guerrilla war\\" approaching different aspects of the novel (alluding to characters, dialogue, plot development, etc.). Franzen also agreed that he would avoid public appearances, saying that \\"...getting some work done is the vacation\\" from the promotional work surrounding The Corrections and How To Be Alone. An excerpt entitled \\"Good Neighbors\\" appeared in the June 8 and June 15, 2009 issues of The New Yorker.\\"Good Neighbors\\", The New Yorker, June 2009 The magazine published a second extract entitled \\"Agreeable\\" in the May 31, 2010 edition. On October 16, 2009, Franzen made an appearance alongside David Bezmozgis at the New Yorker Festival held in the Cedar Lake Theatre to read a portion of his forthcoming novel. Sam Allard, writing for North By Northwestern website covering the event, said that the \\"...material from his new (reportedly massive) novel \\"was as buoyant and compelling as ever\\" and \\"marked by his familiar undercurrent of tragedy.\\" Franzen read \\"an extended clip from the second chapter.\\" On March 12, 2010, details about the plot and content of Freedom were published in the Macmillan fall catalogue for 2010. In an interview with Dave Haslam on October 3, 2010 Franzen discussed why he had called the book Freedom: > The reason I slapped the word on the book proposal I sold three years ago > without any clear idea of what kind of book it was going to be is that I > wanted to write a book that would free me in some way. And I will say this > about the abstract concept of 'freedom'; it's possible you are freer if you > accept what you are and just get on with being the person you are, than if > you maintain this kind of uncommitted I'm free-to-be-this, free-to-be-that, > faux freedom. Franzen has stated the writing of Freedom was deeply impacted by the death of his close friend and fellow novelist David Foster Wallace.Jonathan Franzen, Jonathan Franzen: ‚ÄòModern life has become extremely distracting‚Äô, The Guardian, 2 October 2015. Reception Freedom received general acclaim from book critics, particularly for its writing and characterization. Shortly after the book's release, TIME magazine featured Franzen on its cover, describing him as a \\"Great American Novelist,\\" making him the first author to appear on its cover in a decade. Sam Tanenhaus of The New York Times and Benjamin Alsup of Esquire believed it measured up to Franzen's previous novel, The Corrections. Tanenhaus called it a \\"masterpiece of American fiction,\\" writing that it \\"[told] an engrossing story\\" and \\"[illuminated], through the steady radiance of its author‚Äôs profound moral intelligence, the world we thought we knew.\\"Book review Sam Tanenhaus, The New York Times, 29 August 2010 Alsup called it a great American novel. In The Millions, Garth Risk Hallberg argued that readers who enjoyed The Corrections would enjoy Freedom, writing that readers are \\"likely to come away from this novel moved in harder-to-fathom ways‚Äîand grateful for it.\\" An editor for Publishers Weekly wrote that it stood apart from most modern fiction because \\"Franzen tries to account for his often stridently unlikable characters and find where they (and we) went wrong, arriving at‚Äîincredibly‚Äîgenuine hope.\\" Benjamin Secher of The Telegraph called Franzen one of America's best living novelists, and Freedom the first great American novel of the \\"post-Obama era.\\" In The Guardian, Jonathan Jones called him \\"a literary genius\\" and wrote that Freedom stood on \\"a different plane from other contemporary fiction.\\" Michiko Kakutani called the book \\"galvanic\\" and wrote that it showcased Franzen's talent as a storyteller and \\"his ability to throw open a big, Updikean picture window on American middle-class life.\\" Kakutani also praised the novel's characterization, going on to call it a \\"compelling biography of a dysfunctional family and an indelible portrait of our times.\\" The Economist stated that the novel contained \\"fully imagined characters in a powerful narrative\\" and had \\"all its predecessor's power and none of its faults.\\" Not all reviews were raving. Most lukewarm reviews praised the novel's prose, but believed the author's left-wing political stance was too obvious. Sam Anderson, in a review for New York magazine, thought the characterization was strong, but perceived the politics as sometimes too heavy-handed: \\"Franzen the crank‚Äîmighty detester of Twitter, ATVs, and housing developments\\" occasionally \\"overpower[s] Franzen the artist [...] but if crankiness is the motor that powers Franzen's art, I'm perfectly willing to sit through some speeches.\\" Ron Charles of The Washington Post remarked that it lacked the wit and \\"[freshness]\\" of The Corrections. Charles praised Franzen's prose and called him \\"an extraordinary stylist,\\" but questioned how many readers would settle for good writing as \\"sufficient compensation for what is sometimes a misanthropic slog.\\" Ruth Franklin of The New Republic believed the novel resembled a \\"soap opera\\" more than it did an epic, and that Franzen had forgotten \\"the greatest novels must [...] offer [...] profundity and pleasure.\\" Alexander Nazaryan criticized its familiarity in the New York Daily News remarking that the author \\"can write about a gentrifying family in St. Paul. Or maybe in St. Louis. But that's about it.\\" Nazaryan also didn't believe Franzen was joking when he suggested \\"being doomed as a novelist never to do anything but stories of Midwestern families.\\" Alan Cheuse of National Public Radio found the novel \\"[brilliant]\\" but not enjoyable, suggesting that \\"every line, every insight, seems covered with a light film of disdain. Franzen seems never to have met a normal, decent, struggling human being whom he didn't want to make us feel ever so slightly superior to. His book just has too much brightness and not enough color.\\" In a scathing review, Brian Reynolds Myers called the book \\"juvenile\\" and \\"directionless\\", and filled with \\"mediocrities\\".Smaller Than Life B. R. Myers, The Atlantic, October 2010 (Accessed October 15, 2011) Ross Douthat of First Things praised the \\"stretches of Freedom that read like a master class in how to write sympathetically about the kind of characters\\" with an abundance of freedom. Yet, Douthat concluded the novel was overlong, feeling the \\"impression that Franzen's talents are being wasted on his characters.\\" Awards and endorsements Freedom won the John Gardner Fiction Award. Additionally, it was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction. The American Library Association also named it a notable fiction of the 2010 publishing year. Oprah Winfrey made Freedom her first book club selection of 2010, saying, \\"this book is a masterpiece.\\" US President Barack Obama called it \\"terrific\\" after reading it over the summer.

The title National Artist of the Philippines is given to a Filipino who has been given the highest recognition for having made significant contributions to the development of Philippine arts, namely, Music, Dance, Theater, Visual Arts, Literature, Film, Broadcast Arts, Fashion Design and Architecture, and Allied Arts. Such Filipinos are announced, by virtue of a Presidential Proclamation, as National Artist, having been conferred membership in the Order of National Artists. Benefits they enjoy from then on include a monthly pension, medical and life insurance, arrangements for a state funeral, a place of honor at national state functions, and recognition at cultural events. On July 16, 2013, the controversy finally ended after the Supreme Court of the Philippines voted 12-1-2 that voided the four proclamations created by former President Gloria Arroyo that made these people National Artists. Controversy =President‚Äôs prerogative= The controversy began when conferred the Order of National Artists to seven individuals in July, 2009. Controversy arose from the revelation that musician Ramon Santos had been dropped from the list of nominees short-listed in May that year by the selection committee, and four other individuals had been nominated to the title via \\"President‚Äôs prerogative\\": *Cecille Guidote-Alvarez (Theater), *Magno Jose \\"Carlo‚Äù Caparas (Visual Arts and Film), *Francisco Ma√±osa (Architecture), and *Jose ‚ÄúPitoy‚Äù Moreno (Fashion Design) Members of the Philippine art community, including a number of living National Artists of the Philippines, protested that the proclamation politicized the title of National artist, and made it \\"a way for President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to accommodate her allies.\\" Film director Eddie Romero, himself a National Artist for Film and the Broadcast Arts, explained in an interview that the rules allow the President to pick a National Artist. He noted, however, that: > ‚ÄúIt seems it‚Äôs the first time the presidential prerogative was used to > declare four artists. It‚Äôs like a wholesale declaration.‚Äù National Artist for literature chairman of the Concerned Artists of the Philippines Bienvenido Lumbera, said that in the 2009 nominations, there was > ‚Äúheavy campaigning because the government wanted to ensure the selection of > four people.‚Äù In addition, specific protests were raised regarding the nomination of NCCA executive director Guidote-Alvarez, because it was purportedly a breach of protocol and propriety, and of Carlo Caparas, because protestors assert that he is not qualified to be nominated under either the \\"Visual Arts\\" or \\"Film\\" categories in which he was proclaimed to the order. Alvarez Lumbera, who happened to be a member of the combined ‚Äúfinal selection committee\\" of the NCCA and CCP, noted that: > ‚ÄúIt was Cecile Guidote-Alvarez, as executive director of the NCCA, who had > insisted on the President‚Äôs right to add names that were not discussed in > the committee.‚Äù Calling the situation \\"outrageous\\", he said that: > ‚ÄúShe should have not allowed herself to be named as national artist. She‚Äôs > close to the President. Nobody in the committee thought that she deserved to > be named.\\" Alvarez heads the NCCA secretariat that receives nominations for national artists. Caparas Complaints regarding Caparas' proclamation centered on the complaints that he did not illustrate the comic books he wrote and therefore did not meet the qualifications for being honored under the visual arts category, and the assertion of protesting artists that his work in the category of Film is supposedly \\"sub-par\\", being largely exploitation films: \\"pito-pito\\" (\\"seven-seven\\") films rush-finished in seven days, and \\"massacre films\\" whose focus was sensational crimes. Bienvenido Lumbera remarked that Caparas‚Äô nomination was twice rejected by two NCAA panels: > ‚Äú[Caparas] was first proposed as a nominee for literature, but the committee > rejected him. He was again proposed as nominee for visual artist but the > panel again turned him down.\\" Film Academy of the Philippines director general Leo Martinez noted that \\"He was obviously added by Malaca√±ang.\\" Caparas is known as a vocal supporter of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. =Committee-shortlisted nominees= Protestors, however, were careful to note that three of the individuals proclaimed as National Artist in 2009 were in fact recommended by the selection committee: *Manuel Urbano a.k.a. Manuel Conde (Film and Broadcast), *Lazaro Francisco (Literature), and *Federico Aguilar Alcuaz (Visual Arts, Painting, Sculpture and Mixed Media). = Non-inclusion of Ramon Santos = Protesters also lamented the dropping of musician Ramon Santos from the list of new National Artists. Philippine entertainment news website PEP says that a CCP official, who had asked not to be named, revealed that Santos actually won the most votes during the selection process. Lumbera verbalized dismay about the snubbing of Santos, saying: > \\"What makes this even more outrageous is that Ramon Santos, who received a > good number of votes in the panel selection, was dropped from the list. The > basis for him being scrapped, one doesn't know\\" The same report that quoted Lumbera also noted that \\"Santos still has not spoken about the whole brouhaha up to this day.[August 4, 2009]\\" = Malaca√±ang Honors Committee = Another aspect of the controversy regards the existence and of the Palace Honors committee which allegedly prepared the final list of nominees, which was eventually enacted by Arroyo. Protesters claim that they were not aware of the existence of such a committee, and that at first, they had no idea who precisely were supposed to be on the committee. According to them, nominating committees were made by the CCP and NCCA, and a final list of nominees was prepared by a joint committee. NCCA sub-commission on the arts head Ricardo de Ungria, one of the panelists involved in the selection process, insisted before a congressional committee meeting on the matter that the arts community ‚Äúwere never apprised of the existence of this animal since the start of the selection process this year or eight years ago.‚Äù According to Malaca√±ang and to Cecille Guidote-Alvarez, however, the selection process had always involved the participation of three committees - those of the CCP, the NCCA and the Malaca√±ang honors committee, whose head was Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita. Prominent protestors Living National Artists of the Philippines who have protested the proclamation of the four new National Artists include: *Eddie Romero *F. Sionil Jose *Arturo Luz *Bienvenido Lumbera *Virgilio Almario *BenCab *Salvador Bernal Other prominent critics include prominent Filipino Comic Book artist Gerry Alanguilan, multiple Palanca Award laureate Lourd de Veyra, Film Academy of the Philippines Director General Leo Martinez (who had played a part in the original nomination process). Defense =Arroyo Administration= The Arroyo administration was quick to defend its choices of individuals to be named to the Order of National Artists. Acting Executive Secretary and Presidential political adviser Gabriel Claudio told reporters that: > \\"I think we can defend [their] track record and qualifications and reasons > [for their selection].‚Äù He also said the administration would ‚Äústand by the qualifications, qualities, track record and reputation of those named as National Artists.‚Äù =Carlo J. Caparas= Caparas defended his proclamation, saying that other aspirants to the honor ought to wait their turn. > ‚ÄúGanyan talaga kung may something for grabs. E, iisa lang ang pipiliin. > Sana, maghintay na lang sila ng tamang panahon sa gusto nilang manalo. Hindi > naman ito palakasan.‚Äù(That's the way it is whenever something is for grabs. > Only one person can be selected. They ought to wait for the right time for > them if they want to win. It's not as if this were a case of sucking up.) > Kaya wag mag-alala ang mga critics ko, may pagkakataon pa sila o ang mga > manok nila na manalo in the future. (So my critics shouldn't worry, they or > their fighting cocks still have opportunities to win in the future.) They > cannot take the award from me anymore.\\" > ‚ÄúBaka ang nasa isip nila ay bata pa ako. Pero hindi naman ‚Äòyon ang basehan. > Sino naman ang ko-contest sa decision ng Cultural Center, ng NCCA at ng > Malaca√±ang tungkol sa award na ito? Mabuti na nga at ngayon pa lang ay > ibinibigay na ang ganitong award sa mga taong nandito. Ang akala kasi nila > ay sa matatanda o sa beterano o sa mga patay na ibinibigay ang ganitong > award.‚Äù (Maybe they think I'm too young. But that's not a valid basis [for a > choice]. Who would contest the decision of the Cultural Center, the NCCA, > and Malaca√±ang regarding this award? It's a good thing they're giving this > award to someone who's still here. They think awards like this should only > be given to the old, to veterans, or to the dead.) Caparas said that instead of criticizing his award, entertainment people ‚Äúshould unite and work together to revive the ailing movie and komiks industry.‚Äù He attributed his win to the fact that he managed to cross over from comic books to film and television, and saying that his triumph was significant because he was a National Artist who came from the working class. ‚ÄúI am a National Artist who came from the masses,\\" the Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted him as saying. \\"I work and struggle with them.‚Äù He said it was time for a National Artist ‚Äúwho the masses can identify with‚Äîsomeone who walks beside them, someone who can inspire them.‚Äù Noting that some Filipinos did not even know the National Artists he said ‚ÄúHopefully, since I am still active in TV and in the movies, this will encourage our countrymen to learn more about our National Artists.‚Äù Others who have come to his defense include Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) director and former Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) chief Manoling Morato, Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC) head Dante Jimenez, boxer Manny Pacquiao, Senators Ramon Revilla Jr. and Jinggoy Estrada, Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino chair Joe Lad Santos, and Polytechnic University of the Philippines president Dante Guevarra. =Cecilla Guidote-Alvarez= Guidote-Alvarez also defended her qualifications for receiving the award. ‚ÄúBefore you make a judgment,\\" she said, \\"read my achievements first as an artist. Was I an idiot before I became a national artist?\\" As proof of her achievements, she cited previous awards, including the Ramon Magsaysay public service award for the arts, the CCP Gawad Sining Award for Literature, and the Outstanding Women in the Nation's Services award. She also cited her important role in the development of Philippine theater, having founded the Philippine Educational Theatre Association (PETA) in 1967. She asserted that the President had the prerogative to name national artists who were not named in the selection committee's shortlist, and denied lobbying for the award, saying that President Arroyo had ‚Äúnever talked to [her] about it.\\" Significant events On July 27, 2009, it was announced to the public that President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo had named seven National Artists for 2009: National Commission on Culture and the Arts executive director Cecille Guidote Alvarez (theater); Manuel Conde (film and broadcast arts, posthumous); Lazaro Francisco (literature, posthumous); Federico Aguilar Alcuaz (visual arts in painting, sculpture and mixed media); Magno Jose Carlo Caparas (visual arts and film); Francisco Ma√±oza (architecture); and Jose \\"Pitoy\\" Moreno (fashion design). By August 1, 2009, it had been revealed by members of the final selection committee, comprising members from the NCCA and CCP, that only Conde, Alcuaz and Francisco had been short-listed by the selection committee in May. Alvarez, Caparas,Ma√±osa, and Moreno had been included via what was referred to as the \\"President‚Äôs prerogative\\". They also revealed that a fourth nominee, Ramon Santos (shortlisted for music), had not been conferred the order as recommended by committee ‚Äì also supposedly part of the president's prerogative. Various artists' groups in the Philippines began to protest, notably the Concerned Artists of the Philippines. Over the next few days, previously conferred members of the Order of National Artists, notably Eddie Romero, F. Sionil Jose, Bienvenido Lumbera, Virgilio Almario, and BenCab A number of members of the Comic Book industry, notably Gerry Alanguilan, also protested. = Reactions = On August 6, Representatives Ana Theresia Hontiveros and Walden Bello of the Akbayan Party-list filed House Resolution 1305 at the Philippine House of Representatives, calling for a congressional inquiry into the controversy to make sure that the choice of national artists would not be subject to the ‚Äúwhims\\" of ranking government officials. Hontiveros noted: > \\"Choosing national artists should fundamentally be about contribution in the > arts and culture, not patronage or closeness to Malaca√±ang. Choosing eminent > symbols of Filipino arts and culture should be left in the hands of the arts > community.\\" Also on August 15, the ABS CBN News Channel (ANC) hosted an episode of Cheche Lazaro's Media in Focus, in which the controversial awardees in the person of Caparas and Alavarez were supposed to face off with protesting artists in the person of National Artist Eddie Romero, CCP Chair Emily Abrera, Palanca Award Hall of Fame Awardee Butch Dalisay, and film critic Alexis Tioseco. The first segment of the show allowed Caparas and Dalisay to air their side, while Alvarez was unable to arrive in time to join the second part of a show, which would have had her on a panel with Romero and Abrera, who were protesting the circumstances of her proclamation to the order. On August 7, protesters gathered at the front ramp of the Cultural Center of the Philippines for a major protest action in the form of a mock ‚Äúnecrological service‚Äù. National Artists who joined the protesters were Napoleon Abueva (visual arts), Arturo Luz (visual arts), Ben Cabrera (visual arts), F. Sionil Jose (literature), Bienvenido Lumbera (literature), Virgilio Almario (literature) and Salvador Bernal (theater design). Relatives of deceased National Artists also participated in the event, with singer Celeste Legaspi representing her late father Cesar Legaspi (National Artist for visual arts), and Raul Locsin representing his late brother Leandro Locsin (National Artist for architecture). Protesters offered black roses \\"to symbolize the death of the National Artist Awards.\\" During the protests, the Concerned Artists of the Philippines group, through its chair Lumbera informed the media that they ‚Äúmight seek court injunction\\" at the Supreme Court \\"against the proclamation of the new national artists.\\" After the mock ceremony, participants continued the protest with a motorcade which ended at the offices of the NCCA, where Alvarez serves as head. This led to loud verbal confrontations between protesters and supporters of Alvarez. = Petition with the Supreme Court = On August 19 a group of National Artists and supporters, led by National Artists for Literature Bienvenido Lumbera and Virgilio Almario, asked filed a 38-page petition at the Supreme Court \\"for prohibition, certiorari and injunction with prayer for restraining order to prevent the Palace from conferring the title to respondents,\\" to stop \\"the release of the monetary benefits, entitlements and emoluments‚Ä¶ to private respondents arising from such conferment,\\" and the \\"holding of the acknowledgement ceremonies for their recognition.\\" The petition asserted that: > \\"For the President to cavalierly disregard the collective judgment of the > CCP and NCCA boards, and substitute her own judgment without a clear > indication of the reasons and bases, therefore, is an unacceptable and > manifestly grave abuse of discretion.\\" On August 25 the Supreme Court issued a status quo order, stopping Malaca√±ang from conferring the honor pending deliberation of the petition to disqualify Alvarez, Caparas, Ma√±osa, and Moreno. Supreme Court spokesman Jose Midas Marquez noted that: \\"The court saw the urgency to issue the status quo order and stop the conferment of the awards. It has the same as a temporary restraining order.\\" The incident involving Caparas has also been the subject of vandalism in Wikipedia, where anonymous editors and newly registered accounts maliciously edited the article, substituting the titles with nonsensical ones containing Tagalog pejoratives.Blog entry detailing the Caparas vandalism incident On August 31, 2009, Dalisay claimed in his column in The Philippine Star that the NCCA web page regarding the selection process for national artists had been changed: > When I looked up the National Artists page on the NCCA website, the rules > had suddenly changed ‚Äî now there was a mention of Executive Order 236 > empowering an Honors Committee to make up its own list of NA nominees to the > President. That wasn‚Äôt there before the recent [National Artist] scandal > blew up ‚Äî neither the rule nor the role of the committee in the NAA process. On September 14, 2009, the Philippines' House of Representatives began its committee inquiry into the National Artist controversy. In her testimony before the committee, CCP director and lawyer Lorna Kapunan alleged that the Malaca√±ang honors committee had not actually held a meeting to deliberate on the nominees, and that minutes of the said meeting were therefore forged. Alvarez denied the allegations, and insisted that the selection process for National Artists of the Philippines had always involved the participation of three committees ‚Äì those of the CCP, the NCCA and the Malaca√±ang honors committee. On the same day, the CCP submitted to the Supreme Court its 31-page comment regarding the petition to disqualify the National Artists added by Malaca√±ang to the list of nominees. The CCP reiterated its position that the four had not been in the original list of nominees. It also requested the Supreme Court to order the proclamation of its four original choices as 2009's National Artists. = Aftermath = On July 16, 2013, the Supreme Court voided former President Arroyo's proclamations awarding National Artists to Alvarez, Caparas, Ma√±osa and Moreno, four years after the said proclamations. Arroyo inserted these names although they were not part of the recommendations created by the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the National Commission on Culture and Arts. The original nominees were Lazaro Francisco (literature), Dr. Ramon Santos (music), Manuel Conde (film and broadcast) and Federico Aguilar Alcuaz (visual arts, painting, sculpture and mixed media). The justices voted 12-1-2 that struck down the 4 proclamations. On June 20, 2014, Dr. Ramon Santos was named as one of six new National Artists.Palace declares new National Artists, Nora Aunor didn't make it.

After 1903, the success of Coney Island inspired a proliferation of parks named Luna Park and Electric Park, while the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 inspired the formation of White City amusement parks at roughly the same time. The existence of most of these parks was generally brief: the bulk of them closed by 1917, the year of the United States' entry into World War I. Many pavilions have outlasted the parks themselves, with a few of them still standing today. Electric Parks Postcard view of Electric Park, Baltimore's main entrance, ca. 1907. The entrance also served as a stop for the local trolley (as evidenced by the tracks in the lower right corner). The park buildings were razed in 1916. The emergence of trolley parks in the last dozen years of the 19th century coincided with the rise to prominence of three entities: the electric companies (which grew rapidly as much of the United States was undergoing electrification since the 1880s), the railway companies (which constructed new interurban rail lines mainly in the eastern half of the U. S.), and ‚Äì starting about 1890 ‚Äì the replacement of horse-drawn cars by electric trolley companies. A fourth contributor to the rise in amusement parks in the first decade of the 20th century was the success of Coney Island, which spurred the establishment of dozens of Electric Parks, Luna Parks, and White City amusement parks (the latter actually inspired by White City in the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago), with many metropolitan areas having two (or more) parks with these names. Most Electric Parks were owned by electric companies and trolley companies, which often had one or more lines that transported workers and shoppers between the downtown areas of the various cities and residential and industrial areas. (After 1900, interurban electric rail lines began carrying commuters from one city to another). Originally, the trolleys and interurban lines would either operate at a reduced level on weekends or be completely idle. To generate weekend traffic, the companies eventually created new destinations, generally at the end of their lines, for the public to attend on the weekends, whether it be a picnic park or (later) an amusement park. Regardless of the type of park, the destinations owned by the local electric company or accessed by the electric trolley were commonly called electric parks. After 1903, Luna Park in Coney Island's success (with the park's entrance decked with electric lights) inspired the creation of Electric Parks, which spread throughout North America (at the same time, the similarly-inspired Frederick Ingersoll started to construct his Luna Park empire). Like their Luna Park and White City cousins, a typical Electric Park featured a shoot-the-chutes and lagoon, a roller coaster (usually a figure eight or a mountain railway), a midway, a Ferris wheel, games, and a pavilion. Most also had miniature railroads. Many cities had two (or all three) of the Electric Park/Luna Park/White City triumvirate in their vicinity... with each trying to outdo the others with new attractions, with many incorporating an exhibit simulating the Johnstown Flood of 1889. The competition was fierce, often driving the electric parks out of business with increasing costs of equipment upgrades, upkeep, and insurance. More than a few succumbed to fire. As a result, most were out of business by 1917, the year the United States entered World War I. By the time troops returned to the U.S. (in 1919), almost all the Electric Parks were gone. List of Electric Parks While the date and location of the first Electric Park is currently unknown, several existed before 1900. Since then, dozens of amusement parks had acquired the name: * Electric Park, Aberdeen, Washington * Electric Park, Atlanta, Georgia * Electric Park, Baltimore, Maryland (June 1896 ‚Äì 1916) * Electric Park, Bellingham, Washington Postcard view of Electric Park, Baltimore's Johnstown Flood exhibit.

The central plaza, the Pra√ßa do Giraldo, is also named after him. 200px Geraldo Geraldes or Gerald the Fearless (died prob. 1173), known in Portuguese as Geraldo Sem Pavor (\\"without fear\\"),Owing to the non-standardisation of spelling in the twelfth century, his name may also be rendered Gerardo or Giraldo. The Spanish version of his patronymic is Ger√°ldez. In medieval Latin he was described as Giraldus qui dicebatur sine pavore (\\"Gerald, who is called without fear\\"). was a Portuguese warrior and folk hero of the Reconquista whose theatre of operations was in the barren Alentejo and Extremadura regions of the lower Guadiana river. The city of √âvora was the most lasting of his conquests and was never retaken. His success and independence have suggested parallels with the Castilian hero El Cid and Gerald has been called \\"the Cid of Portugal\\".Or the \\"Portuguese Cid\\", but not without some controversy. To certain Spanish scholars a mere guerilla fighter has no business consorting with El Cid (cf. Cill√°n Cill√°n, n9). Reconquista in Alentejo and Extremadura Around 1162 Gerald assembled a private army (a mesnada) and rapidly developed tactics that proved remarkably successful in seizing Muslim strongholds, though it was not adapted for siege warfare.Clemente Ramos, 653. He \\"perfected techniques of nocturnal surprise in wintry or stormy weather, stealthy escalading of walls by picked commando-like troops, cutting down of sentries and opening of town gates to the larger force stationed without.\\"Bishko, 414‚Äì15. Among the primary sources for Gerald's methods the most important is the contemporary Arabic chronicler Ibn ·π¢ƒÅ·∏•ib al-·π¢alƒÅ, whose Al-Mann bil-ImƒÅma was incorporated into the history of al-Maqqarƒ´ in the seventeenth century. His opinion of Gerald and his tactics is very low: > The dog [Gerald] marched on rainy and very dark nights, with strong wind and > snow, towards the cities and, having prepared his wooden instruments of > scaling [walls] very large, so that they would surpass the wall of the city, > he would apply those ladders to the side of the tower and catch the sentinel > [by surprise] and say to him: \\"Shout, as is your custom,\\" in order that the > people would not hear him. When the scaling of the group had been completed > on the highest wall in the city, they shouted in their language with an > abominable screech, and they entered the city and fought whom they found and > robbed them and captured all who were there in [the city, taking] captive > and prisoner all who were there.Clemente Ramos, 653 n14: El perro caminaba > en noches lluviosas y muy oscuras, de fuerte viento y nieve, hacia las > ciudades y hab√≠a preparado sus instrumentos de escalas de madera muy largas, > que sobrepasen el muro de la ciudad, aplicaba aquellas escaleras al costado > de la torre y sub√≠a por ellas el primero, hasta la torre y cog√≠a al > centinela y le dec√≠a: \\"Grita como es tu costumbre,\\" para que no le sintiese > la gente. Cuando se hab√≠a completado la subida de su grupo a lo m√°s alto del > muro de la ciudad, gritaban en su lengua con un alarido execrable, y > entraban en la ciudad y combat√≠an al que encontraban y le robaban y cog√≠an a > todos los que hab√≠a en ella cautivos y prisioneros a todos los que estaban > all√≠. Of the places Gerald conquered the primary sources are in general agreement, also as to the order of their seizure, but as to the dating of events there is ambiguity. Ibn ·π¢ƒÅ·∏•ib's version goes: Statue of Geraldo the Fearless in √âvora, decapitating a Moor. > In the second Jumada al-awwal [15 April‚Äì13 May] of the anno Hegirae 560 > [1165] the city of Trujillo was surprised, and in Dhu al-Qi'dah the notable > village of √âvora. Also was the population of C√°ceres in Safar 561 [1166], > and the castle of Mont√°nchez in Jumada al-thani and the strongholds of Serpa > and Juromenha.Translated from the Spanish: En Yumada segundo de la hegira > 560 fue sorprendida la ciudad de Truxillo, y en Diskada, la notable villa de > Jeburah. Tambi√©n la poblaci√≥n de C√°ceres en Safar de 561, y el castillo de > Muntajesh en Umada y los fuertes de Severina y Jelmaniyyah (in Cill√°n > Cill√°n). The years 560 and 561 correspond roughly to the annos Domini 1165 and 1166, but here Ibn ·π¢ƒÅ·∏•ib is almost certainly off in his dating by a year. The events rather took place in 1164 and 1165. A later Portuguese chronicle, the Cr√≥nica dos Godos (\\"Chronicle of the Goths\\"), dates the conquest of √âvora to the year 1204 of the Spanish era, that is, 1166.Enrique Fl√≥rez, Espa√±a Sagrada (Madrid: 1796), XIV:428: √Üra 1204. Civitas Elbora capta, & depraedata, & noctu ingressa a Giraldo cognominato sine pavore, & latronibus sociis ejus, & tradidit eam Regi D. Alfonso (In the year 1166 the city of √âvora was captured and depredated, for at night it was entered by Gerald called \\"the Fearless\\", and his associates entered by the latrines, and made over [the city] to the king Don Afonso). Trujillo was taken on 14 May 1164,Floriano Cumbre√±o, see note 10 in Cill√°n Cill√°n. or in June;Cill√°n Cill√°n. √âvora in September 1164; and C√°ceres in December 1164 or, on a later dating, in September 1166. These were the major conquests. The lesser conquests of Mont√°nchez, Serpa, and Juromenha took place in 1165, based on Ibn ·π¢ƒÅ·∏•ib's scheme, but Mont√°nchez and Serpa may have gone in March 1167, as one historian has it. All the primary sources agree that Santa Cruz de la Sierra was the last of Gerald's successes, which may place it as late as 1169, though perhaps earlier (1167/8), along with Ure√±a. The conquest of these last two places left Gerald in a position to harass Beja. The date of the capture of Monfrag√ºe,Variously spelled Mofra, Monfra, Monfrag, and Monsfrag√ºe. which was certainly one of his conquests, cannot be established.Pav√≥n Maldonado, 182. Conflict with Le√≥n So successful was Gerald by 1168 that his eastward expansion threatened the southward expansion of the Kingdom of Le√≥n. These actions were in violation of the succession arrangements laid down by Alfonso VII at Sahag√∫n, since they comprised lands whose conquest had been assigned to Le√≥n.Powers, 42. A few of Gerald's conquests in the far east had even been assigned to Castile. The Leonese king, Ferdinand II, son of Alfonso VII, took action immediately after the taking of C√°ceres, probably early in the spring of 1166, capturing Alc√°ntara later that year and thus securing a crossing over the Tagus.Hern√°ndez Gim√©nez (part III), 311‚Äì12. Subsequently he allied with the Almohad caliph Yusuf I, who had warned him of Gerald and the Portuguese's encroachments on his interests. In the early summer of 1169, Gerald took the taifa and city of Badajoz after a long siege, but the garrison took refuge in the citadel, the alcazaba, the siege of which continued. Seeing an opportunity to add to his domains the chief city of the region at the expense of both his Muslim and Christian enemies, Afonso I of Portugal came with an army to Badajoz to relieve his nominal vassal. This provoked the opposition of Ferdinand of Le√≥n, who claimed Badajoz as his own and came south with an army at the request of Yusuf, who had already sent a contingent of 500 cavalry to assist the garrison. The besieging Portuguese were themselves besieged by the Leonese and fighting broke out in the streets. While trying to flee, Afonso was caught on the hinge of a gate and flung from his horse, breaking his leg. He was captured by Ferdinand's men, while Gerald was captured by the Leonese majordomo, Fern√°n Ruiz de Castro, called el Castellano (\\"the Castilian\\"). He was an important person at court, who for a while held the highest military post in the capital (tenente turris Legionis, \\"possessing the tower of Le√≥n\\"). He was the king's brother-in-law, being married to Stephanie the Unfortunate, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso VII by his second mistress, Urraca Fern√°ndez, and thus a half-sister of Ferdinand II. After the m√™l√©e the Leonese had control of the town and the alcazaba, which they soon relinquished to their Muslim allies. Ferdinand succeeded in gaining the valley of the upper Limia and the regions of Toro√±o (around Tuy), Capraria (around Ver√≠n), and Lobarzana (around Chaves) from Afonso in exchange for his release.Fletcher, 134. Several of Gerald's conquests were ceded to purchase his freedom. Ferdinand retained C√°ceres, but Trujillo, Mont√°nchez, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Monfrag√ºe he gave to Fern√°n Ruiz.Ibn ·π¢ƒÅ·∏•ib states that three years after its conquest, between 17 October 1167 and 4 October 1168, Gerald was forced to cede Trujillo to a certain Ferdinand, called a brother-in-law of \\"Fernando el Baboso\\" (Ferdinand the Stupid), that is, the king of Le√≥n. The gift to Fern√°n is also recorded in a Christian source, the Chronica latina regum castellae. The date given by Ibn ·π¢ƒÅ·∏•ib conflicts with the dates of 1169 (cf. Bishko, 414‚Äì15) or 1170 (cf. Clemente Ramos, 649‚Äì50) found in other sources. Cf. Hern√°ndez Gim√©nez (part I), 93. Serving the Almohads In 1171 and 1172,Years in which Muhammad ibn Mardanish of Murcia was defeated by Yusuf and then died, leaving his kingdom of the taking. while Yusuf was waging war on Valencia and Murcia, general anarchy prevailed in the Extremadura as Leonese, Portuguese, and Almohad troops fought for supremacy. Gerald took advantage of Yusuf's absence to conquer Beja in the Alentejo (1172). When he and Afonso disagree over whether to hold the site or raze it, Gerald‚Äî\\"impoverished and bereft of all aid\\" Original Latin: depaupertatus autem et destitutus omni auxilio transtulit se ad Sarracenos, quibus multa dampna intulerat (quoted in Barton, n84).‚Äîwent to Seville to put himself in the service of the caliph. To keep him away from Portugal he was sent to Morocco with 350 troops.Barton, 28‚Äì35. There he received the governorship of al-S≈´s (the plains and mountains of southern Morocco), but soon entered into negotiations with his former monarch concerning the use of al-S≈´s as a base for a Portuguese invasion. When his correspondence was intercepted, he was arrested and put to death. The Chronica latina regum castellae, a Latin Christian chronicle, summarises Gerald's career in one paragraph at the end of its tenth chapter: > Also then [at the capture of Afonso I at Badajoz] was captured Gerald, alias > \\"without fear\\", who was given over to Rodrigo Fern√°ndez , the Castilian, to > whom, in exchange for his liberty, Gerald handed over Mont√°nchez, Trujillo, > Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Monfrag√ºe, which the same Gerald had gained > from the Saracens, to whom he had caused much damage, and by whom he was > decapitated in Moroccan territory on a laughable pretext.Original Latin > (from Cill√°n Cill√°n): Tunc et caputs fuit Giraldus qui dicebant sine pavore > et traditus in manus Roderici Fernandi Castellani, cui pro liberatione sua > dedit idem Giraldus Montages, Trujellum, Sancta Cruz, Monfra que idem > Giraldus acquisierat a sarracenis. > Spanish translation (from Cr√≥nica Latina de los reyes de Castilla, 10): > Tambi√©n fue entonces capturado Giraldo, alias \\"Sin miedo\\", quien fue > entregado a Rodrigo Fern√°ndez, el Castellano, al que, a cambio de su > libertad, Giraldo entreg√≥ Mont√°nchez, Trujillo, Santa Cruz de la Sierra y > Mofra, que el mismo Giraldo hab√≠a ganado a los sarracenos, a los que hab√≠a > causado muchos da√±os, y por los que fue decapitado en tierras marroqu√≠es con > un pretexto balad√≠. The chief source for Gerald's negotiations with the caliph and his death in Morocco is Ibn \`IdhƒÅrƒ´ al-MarrƒÅkushƒ´'s Al-BayƒÅn al-Mugrib. Many of the cities and castles that Gerald captured with ease were later re-conquered by the Almohads, who improved their fortifications so much that they were not taken by the Christians again until the next century.Clemente Ramos, 701. C√°ceres was besieged four times without success (1184, 1213, 1218, and 1222) and is usually referred to as a castrum famossum (\\"famous castle\\") or muy fuerte castillo (\\"very strong castle\\") in Christian sources, although it had fallen relatively easily to Gerald.Clemente Ramos, 655. Trujillo was not taken by the Christians again until 1234.Clemente Ramos, 670. The defences of Badajoz were completely reworked after 1169 and those that survive today are almost entirely of the Almohad period; the city only fell to the Christians permanently in 1226.Clemente Ramos, 677‚Äì78. 250px The dauntless Gerald: in his left he bears Two watchmen's heads, his right the falchion rears: The gate he opens, swift from ambush rise His ready bands, the city falls his prize: √âvora still the grateful honour pays, Her banner'd flag the mighty deed displays: There frowns the hero; in his left he bears The two cold heads, his right the falchion rears. ‚ÄîCamoens, The Lusiads (Canto VIII, 21)Translation from the 1887 edition of William Julius Mickle's (1776) translation, p. 229. Other translation available online are J. J. Aubertin (London: 1884), p. 107, and Richard Francis Burton with Isabel Burton (London: 1880), vol. II, p. 296. Legacy and legend Gerald left his mark on the toponymy of the Extremadura. A document of the Order of Calatrava of 1218 refers to the cabeza de giraldo (\\"head of Gerald\\") as a place, without indicating where it lay. Two streams, the Geradillo and the Geraldo, the first flowing from the second and into the Tagus, are also named after Gerald. The region where the stream originates is in the highlands around Casas de Miravete, which is quite possibly the site of the cabeza.Hern√°ndez Gim√©nez (part III), 303. The legends which later arose surrounding Gerald are given concise retelling by Louis-Adrien Duperron de Castera, a French translator: > He was a man of rank, who, in order to avoid the legal punishment to which > several crimes rendered him obnoxious, put himself at the head of a party of > freebooters. Tiring, however, of that life, he resolved to reconcile himself > to his sovereign by some noble action. Full of this idea, one evening he > entered √âvora, which then belonged to the Moors. In the night he killed the > sentinels of one of the gates, which he opened to his companions, who soon > became masters of the place. This exploit had its desired effect. The king > pardoned Gerald, and made him governor of √âvora. A knight with a sword in > one hand, and two heads in the other, from that time became the armorial > bearing of the city.From Mickle's translation of Castera's notes to Camoens, > p. 229 n3.

In late 2005, Research Engineers International was bought by Bentley Systems. STAAD.Pro is one of the most widely used structural analysis and design software products worldwide. It supports over 90 international steel, concrete, timber & aluminium design codes. It can make use of various forms of analysis from the traditional static analysis to more recent analysis methods like p-delta analysis, geometric non-linear analysis, Pushover analysis (Static-Non Linear Analysis) or a buckling analysis. It can also make use of various forms of dynamic analysis methods from time history analysis to response spectrum analysis. The response spectrum analysis feature is supported for both user defined spectra as well as a number of international code specified spectra. Additionally, STAAD.Pro is interoperable with applications such as RAM Connection, AutoPIPE, SACS and many more engineering design and analysis applications to further improve collaboration between the different disciplines involved in a project. STAAD can be used for analysis and design of all types of structural projects from plants, buildings, and bridges to towers, tunnels, metro stations, water/wastewater treatment plants and more.  Important Features  = Analytical Modeling = Analytical model can be created using the ribbon-based user interface, by editing the command file or by importing several other files types like dxf, cis/2 etc. The model geometry can even be generated from the data of macro-enabled applications (like Microsoft Excel, Microstation etc.) by using Macros. = Physical Modeling = Physical modeling has been a significant feature included in the program. STAAD.Pro Physical Modeler takes advantage of physical modeling to simplify modeling of a structure, which in turn more accurately reflects the process of building a model. Beams and surfaces are placed in the model on the scale of which they would appear in the physical world. A column may span multiple floors and a surface represents an entire floor of a building, for example. A joint is then generated anywhere two physical objects meet in the model (as well as at the free ends of cantilevered members, for convenience). = STAAD Building Planner = STAAD Building Planner is a module that enables seamless generation of building models that can be analyzed and designed thereafter in the program itself. Operations like defining geometry, making changes in the geometric specifications are matters of only few clicks in this workflow. = Steel AutoDrafter = Steel AutoDrafter workflow extracts planar drawings and material take-off from a structural steel model prepared in STAAD.Pro. It produces excellent quality plans at any level and sections in any of the orthogonal directions. = STAAD.Beava = The general philosophy governing the design of bridges is that, subject to a set of loading rules and constraints, the worst effects due to load application should be established and designed against. The process of load application can be complex as governing rules can impose interdependent parameters such as loaded length on a lane, lane factors, and load intensity. To obtain the maximum design effects, engineers have to try many loading situations on a trial and error basis. This leads to the generation of many live load application instances (and a large volume of output data) that then must be combined with dead load and other effects, as well. Bridge Deck is used to minimize the load application process while complying with national code requirements. The program is based on the use of influence surfaces, which are generated by STAAD.Pro as part of the loading process. An influence surface for a given effect on a bridge deck relates its value to movement of a unit load over the point of interest. The influence surface is a three-dimensional form of an influence line for a single member (or, in other words, it is a 2D influence function). STAAD.Pro will automatically generate influence surfaces for effects such as bending moments for elements, deflection in all the degrees of freedom of nodes, and support reactions. The user then instruct the program to utilize the relevant influence surfaces and, with due regards to code requirements, optimize load positions to obtain the maximum desired effects. = Advanced Concrete Design = The Advanced Concrete Design workflow provides direct access for STAAD.Pro models to leverage the power of the RCDC application. This is a standalone application, which is operated outside the STAAD.Pro environment, but requires a model and results data from a suitable analysis. The model should typically be formed from beams and columns (plates are currently not supported). RCDC can be used to design the following objects: Pile Caps, Footings, Columns and walls, Beams, Slabs. As the projects progresses, each design created in RCDC is retained and displayed when RCDC is re-entered, so that previous designs can be recalled and/or continued. Detailed drawings and BBS of excellent quality can be generated as required and they are quite ready to be sent for execution. = Advanced Slab Design = The STAAD.Pro Advanced Slab Design workflow is an integrated tool that works from within the STAAD.Pro environment. Concrete slabs can be defined, and the data can be transferred to RAM Concept. The data passed into RAM Concept includes the geometry, section and material properties, loads and combination information, and analysis results. = Earthquake Mode = Eurocode 8: Part 1 contains specific requirements and recommendations for building structures that are to be constructed in seismic regions. Essentially, these fundamental requirements have been provided to ensure that the structures can sustain the seismic loads without collapse and also ‚Äì where required‚Äì avoid suffering unacceptable damage and can continue to function after an exposure to a seismic event. This STAAD.Pro workflow is used to check if the structure conforms to the basic geometric recommendations made in Eurocode 8 (EC8). This workflow is in addition to the normal post-processing workflow which gives the various analysis results. These checks are intended to give you a \\"feel\\" for the structure and are not mandatory to proceed to the design phase. = OpenSTAAD Macro Editor =  OpenSTAAD Macro Editor  OpenSTAAD is a library of exposed functions enabling engineers access STAAD.Pro‚Äôs internal functions and routines as well as its graphical commands. With OpenSTAAD, one can use VBA macros to perform such tasks as automating repetitive modeling or post-processing tasks or embedding customized design routines. Following an open architecture paradigm, OpenSTAAD was built using ATL, COM, and COM+ standards as specified by Microsoft. This allows OpenSTAAD to be used in a macro application like Microsoft Excel or Autodesk AutoCAD. OpenSTAAD can also be used to link STAAD data to Web-based applications using ActiveX, HTML, and ASP. Through the in-built Macro Editor, one can leverage the functionalities of OpenSTAAD and automate the analysis and design workflows, thereby eliminating the chance of occurrence of potential errors due to manual intervention and reducing the required time for execution of the whole workflow (as compared to the manual execution time), to a large extent.

Method Jadeja would sit outside the Shikoter Mataji temple in Ahmedabad and tell people that if they kept their money with him, the goddess would make them wealthy. His initial targets were women known to be followers of the goddess Vahanwati Sikotar Mataji. Claiming divine powers, he would invite them to participate in religious rituals and then lure them into contributing whatever they could. In order to gain his target's confidence, Jadeja would initially pay back three times the amount given to him. Reports initially suggested he accumulated more than twenty crore in three States of India with the help of approximately thirty-five accomplices. This amount changed to thousands of crores which was given to accomplices and used to purchase gold and real estate investments in Gujarat and neighboring areas. Arrest and aftermath He was arrested on 31 May 2009 with his wife Neeta and Rs. 19.8 million.

He has been noted as \\"arguably the best-selling painter of his generation of Filipino artists.\\" Early life and education BenCab was born to Democrito Cabrera and Isabel Reyes in Malabon, Philippines on April 10, 1942. He was the youngest of nine children. BenCab's first exposure and discovery of the arts happened through his elder Brother Salvador, who was already an established artist during Bencab's childhood. He went on to study at the University of the Philippines Diliman, where he explored different art visual forms - photography, draftsmanship, printmaking - while honing his chosen craft as a painter. He received his bachelor's degree in Fine Arts in 1963. Family and European Career Cabrera in New York. c. 2013. BenCab met British journalist Caroline Kennedy (author of An Affair of State, 1987, and How the English Establishment Framed Stephen Ward, 2013) in Manila in 1968, and married her in London in 1969. The couple decided to stay in London. They have three children. The eldest, Elisar, was born in 1971 and is now a film and web series producer, married to award-winning playwright and web series writer, Lisa Gifford, based in London; Their middle child, Mayumi, was born in Manila in 1973 and became a successful model both in London and Los Angeles. She currently lives in Los Angeles with her partner, John A. Fries and their two children, Ronan (2011) and Ione (2013). Their youngest, Jasmine was born in 1977, mother of Sienna Daphne (b.2016) and lives in Quezon City. Bencab's first years as a painter in London \\"were not particularly easy\\", but his talents were immediately recognized. Over the next four decades, he established for himself a name of international importance, holding exhibitions from London to New York to Macau, and winning several major art awards in a career spanning four decades. When BenCab returned to the Philippines in 1972, he was hailed as a Filipino pioneer of the arts and a significant influence among his peers. However, he returned to London once more in 1974, partly to get away from the tightening grip of Martial Law, which Ferdinand Marcos had declared in 1972. That event is said to have \\"marked the beginning of [BenCab]'s passionate involvement with social commentary and the topics of repression and freedom,\\" turning him into a key figure in the development of protest art against the Marcos dictatorship. His Larawan series was developed out of his nostalgia for the Philippines. He and Caroline used to scour local flea markets all over Europe looking for early maps and prints of the Philippines. This collection became the basis for his Larawan series. In 1985, however, BenCab's 16-year marriage with Kennedy ended in divorce, and he eventually decided to come home to the Philippines. The Baguio Years BenCab eventually returned to the Philippines, and settled in the City of Baguio in Northern Luzon, eventually putting up a studio and a secluded little farm on Asin road, in the nearby town of Tuba, Benguet. He and a small group of fellow artists - visual artist Santiago Bose, filmmaker Kidlat Tahimik, and sculptor Ben Hur Villanueva, among others, established the Baguio Arts Guild (BAG). It was during this period in his career that BenCab began to more deeply explore the use handmade paper as a medium on which to work. When the 1990 Luzon earthquake struck, BenCab and the BAG helped out by instituting programs such as the ArtAid workshop for traumatized children, and a fund-raising art auction they titled \\"Artquake.\\" Bencab was elected president of the guild the following year. Later in the 1990s, BenCab's input was a critical element in the creation of Tam-awan Village, \\"a refuge for local artists who desire a nurturing environment in which to develop their talents, and a community for all those who wish to take part in the harmonious fusion of art, culture, environment, and history.\\" BenCab also exhibited considerably during the last decade of the Millennium, also reaping many accolades. Among the most prominent of the many awards received by BenCab during this period was the Gawad CCP Para sa Sining (Cultural Center of the Philippines Award for the Arts) in 1992. National Artist and Recent Awards In 2006, the Philippine Government conferred upon him the Order of National Artist for Visual Arts.

Saturday family =Zak Saturday= *Voice Actor: Sam Lerner, Ogie Banks (Ben 10: Omniverse) Zak Saturday is the 11-year-old (he turns 12 in \\"Kur\\" and turns 13 in \\"Life in the Underground\\") major character of the show. The son of Doc and Drew Saturday, Zak seeks adventure at every turn, which is easily satisfied by his cryptid-researching family. Zak has an unorthodox upbringing that has taken him around the planet and placed him in the face of danger since the day he was born. Zak was born the same year the Kur Stone was found and has a special psychic ability to connect with cryptids, allowing him to control their actions to an extent. Tamer cryptids seem to trust him instinctively and even fiercer ones can tell that Zak is different from other humans. Zak's primary weapon is the Claw, a combination staff/grappling hook which acts as a focusing device for his powers. Zak also seems stronger and more durable than a normal child his age, as he was able to climb a radio tower carrying a full grown man in \\"The Vengeance of Hibagon\\" and gets back up immediately after being thrown against a vent in \\"Black Monday\\". For a while, it was believed that if the cryptid Kur was ever unleashed, Zak would be the only one with the power to stop it. However, it was eventually learned that the Kur Stone Doc and Drew discovered before Zak's birth contained Kur's essence. When it was uncovered, the energy was released from the stone and found a new host, namely, the unborn Zak.Kur, Part 1, Zak: \\"So I'm what? Half-cryptid?\\" Despite the Saturdays trying to keep the truth about Zak's nature secret, the other Secret Scientists found out through unexplained means and began pursuing Zak, forcing the Saturdays to go on the run. The Nagas have also sought him, intending to have him embrace his inner nature and become their new master. Following Rani Nagi's attack on Manhattan, Zak and Fiskerton are approached by V.V. Argost, who offers Zak a deal that will \\"help [him] master his Kur abilities.\\" Zak agreed to the plan, though Argost has informed him that he has his own hidden agenda. Zak later told Doyle to find out as much as he can about Argost's past. During a fight with an Ahuizotl in \\"The Thousand Eyes of Ahuizotl\\", Zak discovered that his powers enabled him to sense cryptids without seeing them. =Solomon \\"Doc\\" Saturday= * Voice Actor: Phil Morris, Bumper Robinson (Ben 10: Omniverse) Solomon \\"Doc\\" Saturday is the patriarch and the \\"Indiana Jones\\"-like character who has spent his whole life studying cryptids. Doc Saturday naturally had black hair but after a fight with a guardian known as Tsul 'Kalu, Doc was shocked by the claw that originally belonged to Kalu, giving him a streak of white hair and blinding him in his right eye. A man who takes science very seriously, Doc is one of the Earth's leading experts in the field of cryptozoology. Doc started his career on Honey island when he was 12, learning from Dr. Basil Lancaster. He is a supergenius, having built many of the gadgets the family uses. A loving father, he often tries to teach his son Zak responsibility. Doc is trained in fourteen different forms of martial arts. He fights with the Battle Glove, which is able to channel power into his right fist. The four crystals on the knuckles also have individual powers: freezing, heating, shocking, and sonic vibrations. Though his age is not definite, creator Jay Stephens has stated that he \\"imagined Doc as 40 or so.\\" =Drew Saturday= * Voice Actor: Nicole Sullivan, Vanessa Marshall (Ben 10: Omniverse) Drew Saturday is the matriarch and the one who \\"believes in magic,\\" being more prone to accepting things on faith rather than empirical evidence. Drew was born to a family of adventurer-scientists. After her family was scattered during a severe blizzard in the Himalaya, she was raised by monks who may have taught her to believe not everything needs a reasonable/scientific explanation. Years later, she was reunited with her long lost brother, Doyle. She is able to speak 37 different languages which, in many episodes, comes in handy. Drew is always encouraging Zak to try new things like tribal dancing or sand painting, but when there's a risk of danger, Drew gets a little overly protective of her only son. She's a mystic who is well-versed in the Earth's cultures and can blend in anywhere her travels may take her. In 'And Your Enemies Closer', she and Doyle reunited in the Himalayas at the same place that their family was lost. She then learns that it wasn't the blizzard that separated her and Doyle, but an attack on their camp by The Yeti. Much to her shock, she and Doyle discovered that the cryptid that destroyed their family is in fact Argost. Drew's preferred weapon is the Tibetan Fire Sword that was given to her by the monks, which absorbs light and channels it into potent bursts of flame. Her sword needs light to access the fire; if there is no light source around, it shoots blue flames. In \\"Food of the Giants\\" she shows her skill as an expert at wilderness survival. Like Doc, she is a skilled fighter. Though her age is not definite, Jay Stephens stated that he \\"imagined her as 34 or so.\\" =Fiskerton= * Voice Actor: Diedrich Bader, Corey Burton (Ben 10: Omniverse) Fiskerton is a seven- foot-tall \\"gorilla-cat\\" with glowing red eyes, based on the Fiskerton Phantom. He was adopted by the Saturday family when his home was burned down in Nottinghamshire, England. Although he is the oldest and largest member of the family, Fiskerton is like an innocent brother to Zak. He may be a coward at times, but he is proven to be a great and strong ally to have, willing to risk his life for his new family. He mostly talks in grunts and mumbling which occasionally mimic human speech, though the family is able to understand him regardless. Even though Fiskerton is a cryptid and not human, he and Zak share a brotherly friendship. Fiskerton has great strength, as he is capable of ripping apart metal bare-handed and hold his own against larger cryptids. His feet are as dexterous as his hands, allowing him to climb things with ease. In \\"Once More the Nightmare Factory\\", it is revealed that Fiskerton is a Lemurian, a member of a race of creatures that guard the Earth against Kur and is able to locate Kur through psychic and instinctual means. =Komodo= * Voice Actor: Fred Tatasciore Komodo is a 250-pound, genetically-altered Komodo dragon with a voracious appetite. He can become invisible and make other objects invisible, which comes in handy for stealth missions. Though for the most part he is very obedient, Komodo's actions are often dictated by his stomach and he will ignore the family for a good meal. Extending from this, Komodo will often pick fights with others to get food, even when his opponent is far larger and stronger. Like a rivalry between a cat and dog, Komodo often fights with Fiskerton. He seems to have a feud with Zon as well, as he attacks her at least twice. Like Fiskerton, Zak sees him as a brother. He also likes to eat Ulraj's kelp necklace, much to Ulraj's disliking. =Zon= * Voice Actor: Fred Tatasciore Zon, named after the Amazon rainforest where she was found, is a pterosaur who lives in a nest near the Saturday Headquarters, but isn't truly owned by them. The Saturdays anger her by crashing into her nest during the second episode, but she comes to appreciate them after Zak saves her life. She now uses the cliffs where the Saturdays live as her new hunting grounds. Unafraid of humans, she allows Zak to comb her mane and ride her, but resists the family's domestication efforts and refuses to give up the great outdoors. Like Komodo and Fiskerton, Zak sees her as a family member, in this case as a sister. In \\"Kur, Part 1,\\" Zon is revealed to be aiding Doyle in locating the missing V.V. Argost. She is currently helping Doyle find information about Argost's past. =Doyle Blackwell= * Voice Actor: Will Friedle Doyle is Zak's biological uncle, Doc's brother-in-law and Drew's long- lost younger brother. He first appears as Van Rook's apprentice in \\"The Kur Stone\\". He helps Zak put a tribe of Amaroks back into hibernation in \\"The Ice Caverns of Ellef Ringnes\\", starting a stable relationship with him. At first, he and the Saturdays are unaware of any biological relationship between them. In \\"Van Rook's Apprentice\\", he changes sides and joins the Saturdays after learning he is Drew's brother and about V.V. Argost's true motives. Though Doyle is admired by Zak, he and Drew have a small sibling rivalry and at first, he and Doc barely get along at all. Doc is annoyed by Doyle's tendency to show off and is also frustrated by Doyle's chaotic lifestyle, which proves an unfortunate influence on Zak. Doyle resents what seems to him to be constant criticism by Doc of his methods and tactics, as well as what he perceives to be Doc being judgmental of his mercenary trade. Eventually, they make up, as the threat from Argost grows greater and Doc recognizes the potential value of Doyle's unique skills. Doyle is something of a jack-of-all- trades, fighting using a combination of grenades, lasers, as well as hand-to- hand combat. He is strong enough to lift a grown man one-handed and is able to wrestle with cryptids much larger than himself. As shown in \\"The Atlas Pin\\" he's shown to be not entirely reformed as he was willing to go behind Drew's back to gather the pieces of Rani Nagi's Kur relic. It was mostly because of Doyle that Kur was revealed to be Zak as he repaired the relic and brought it into the proximity of Zak at the end of \\"Kur Rising\\". Jay Stephens himself has already said that he imagined Doyle to be \\"28 or so\\". In \\"Kur\\", Doyle, aided by Zon and Van Rook, is looking for the missing V.V. Argost. After finding what seemed to be proof that Argost was dead, he reported his findings to the family. Zak secretly informed him that Argost was indeed still alive and asked him to search for information regarding Argost's past. With Zon and Van Rook continuing to aid him, he tracked down those who had connections to Argost's past, but it proved difficult as they kept not-so-mysteriously disappearing. In 'And Your Enemies Closer', his search led him to the Himalayan monks who had raised Drew after they were separated. Upon reuniting with Drew, she informs him that it was here that they lost their parents. Doyle recalls that he ended up sliding down the slope and wound up in an orphanage, which led to the way he grew up. He then reveals something shocking to Drew: it was not the storm that ruined their family, but an attack from a cryptid called a Yeti. Upon finding the beast's abandoned lair, Doyle and Drew make a shocking revelation: the Yeti who attacked their family, killed their parents, caused them to be separated and grow up in different ways was in fact Argost. Allies and neutral characters =Leonidas Van Rook= * Voice Actor: Corey Burton Leonidas Van Rook is a ruthless cryptozoologist who is the ally of V.V. Argost and a rival of Doc Saturday. Van Rook is interested in proving the existence of cryptids for money. He is very thrifty, almost to a fault. Similar to Doc, he is an inventor and has many high-tech gadgets. He and Drew dated in college, much to her dismay. After Doyle left him, Van Rook hired Abbey Grey. In \\"Kur\\", Van Rook admits that he trained Abbey too well because she has taken over the mercenary business from him. He seems to have gotten out of shape between Season 1 and Season 2: Doyle pointed out that he had some extra gut room in his armor and he even admitted he was out of shape while fighting Munya. He has been recruited by Doyle to find V.V. Argost after he found Van Rook working with Ron Bantington. When Doyle and his quest to learn the secrets of Argost's past leads to the Himalayas, they are reunited with Drew, who does not greet Van Rook with open arms, it is also shown that even he is disgusted that Argost only attacked people for sadistic pleasure. He fought alongside the Saturdays in 'War Of The Cryptids', against Argost's cryptid army. He ultimately sacrifices himself to save Drew Saturday from a blast from her own fire sword when it was taken by Rani Nagi during the final battle at Weirdworld, saying she was the only thing he loved almost as much as money. After Argost was destroyed and his cryptid army retreated, the Saturdays and their friends paid their respects to their old enemy turned friend. Doyle says goodbye by tossing three flowers onto his grave, then takes one away and says, \\"Two is plenty.\\" =Dr. Arthur Beeman= * Voice Actor: Jeff Bennett Dr. Arthur Beeman is a Secret Scientist who studies aliens and UFOs. However, far from being a conspiracy nut, his obsession is apparently justified as he saved the Earth from invasion by figuring out the 'crop circle code'. Beeman is often blunt and mildly insulting in his speech. Doc and Drew called him in to watch Zak, Fiskerton, Komodo, and Zon while they were away on their anniversary dinner. In 'War Of The Cryptids,' it is found out that he has a recording from the Flute of Gilgamesh. He uses this against Zak and Argost, almost to the point of killing them. He is stopped by Miranda and is never seen again. =Dr. Henry Cheveyo= * Voice Actor: Diedrich Bader Dr. Henry Cheveyo is another Secret Scientist who held a piece of the Kur Stone. Argost stole it, then used a cryptid parasite to extract the location of the third piece from him. He works at the Mesa Observatory in Arizona. He was seriously wounded when he took the brunt of an explosion meant to kill the Saturdays, but survived. =Dr. Miranda Grey= * Voice Actor: Susan Blakeslee Dr. Miranda Grey is a Secret Scientist who held a piece of the Kur Stone until Munya stole it. She's an expert at quantum physics and works on particle acceleration in Antarctica with her robot sidekick Deadbolt. She has a gun which can create miniature wormholes, allowing her to physically attack opponents from a distance. She is Abbey Grey's sister and was dissatisfied that she sided with Leonidas Van Rook. In \\"Kur\\" Pt. 1, she is one of the scientists after Zak. In the \\"Thousand Eyes of Ahuizoti,\\" it's revealed that she has been watching Weird World for surveillance. In \\"War of the Cryptids,\\" Miranda had a change of heart as she saved Zak in the season finale from a copy of the song that would harm Kur. She attends Van Rook's funeral. Deadbolt Deadbolt is a robot that is Miranda Grey's sidekick. In \\"Kur\\" Pt. 1 and \\"The Thousand Eyes of Ahuizotl\\", it assists Miranda in hunting Zak. It's a recurring joke that in every episode he appears in, he gets destroyed only to come back later new and improved. Miranda also mentions that Dead Bolt costs $37,000,000 to repair. =Dr. Paul Cheechoo= * Voice Actor: Danny Cooksey Dr. Paul Cheechoo is a Secret Scientist that specializes in cold- climate research. He and a team of experts travel the Earth studying strange geological anomalies. He's currently stationed at Ellef Ringnes. In one episode he mentions he grew up in cold weather and he indirectly reveals at the end of \\"Where Lies the Engulfer\\" that he is from Canada. The Saturdays tend to cause, or at least get involved in, ecological disasters when they do any work near him, which he eventually points out with slight annoyance. He also has more of a sense of humor than the other Secret Scientists and seem to be the most friendly with Zak. He attended Van Rook's funeral. =Professor Talu Mizuki= * Voice Actor: Jerry Tondo Professor Talu Mizuki is a scientist who invented a mind-swapping device for crime lord and philanthropist Shoji Fuzen. When asked to use it to implant the mind of one of Fuzen's men into a Hibagon, he takes the Hibagon's body himself to prevent Fuzen from getting his hands on the Hibagon, which Fuzen sees as a potential superweapon. In the ensuing confrontation, his body is lost in a fire and the mind-swapping device is destroyed. He attempts to take revenge against Fuzen, but is convinced by Doc to let it go. He now lives in a cave lab alongside his white tiger working on a way to get his mind back into his body and continue his research. Apparently, he has become a member of the Secret Scientists as was shown in \\"Eterno\\" where he helps the other scientists solve the Eterno crisis. In \\"Kur\\" Pt. 1, he is one of the scientists after Zak. =Ulraj= * Voice Actor: Adam Wylie The young prince of Kumari Kandam, whose father was killed in an assault orchestrated by V.V. Argost. He allied with Zak to reclaim his kingdom from V.V. Argost. With help from the Saturdays, Ulraj reclaimed his kingdom, but V.V. Argost and Munya escaped with an ancient and powerful Sumerian medallion which Ulraj stated to be too dangerous to wield. In \\"The Underworld Bride,\\" King Ulraj later helped the Saturdays when the Dua'a was trying to take Zon into the Underworld. In that episode, he exhibits the ability to detect electric fields. In \\"The Atlas Pin\\", Ulraj helps stop the Nagas from pulling the Atlas Pin. He has a friendly rivalry with Zak. In \\"Life in the Underground\\" he and Zak both compete for Wadi's affection which turns the friendly competition into a less than friendly one. Ulraj later admits that he doesn't like Wadi, he just doesn't like losing to Zak. =Agent Epsilon= * Voice Actor: Brian Stepanek Agent Epsilon and his 11-year-old \\"son\\" Francis are members of a secret organization loosely allied with the Secret Scientists, though they have their own agenda. Epsilon is usually quite serious and by the book, personifying the \\"Men in Black\\" archetype. He also has access to \\"the files\\" which is a large database on everyone and everything. He also has a group called his \\"people\\" for protection. It is revealed in \\"The Unblinking Eye\\" that he and Francis are actually clones of the \\"perfect agent\\" their organization found 100 years ago. =Francis= * Voice Actor: Scott Menville The 11-year-old \\"son\\" of Agent Epsilon. Francis is clever and manipulative, just like his \\"father\\". Francis wears a shield generator that shocks anyone who tries to touch him without permission. He and Zak have a rivalry, as evident in \\"The Swarm at the Edge of Space\\" and \\"Paris Is Melting\\". He is a bit jealous of Zak because he has a \\"normal\\" family and Francis does not. It was revealed in \\"The Unblinking Eye\\" that Francis and Epsilon are clones of a \\"perfect agent\\" their organization found 100 years ago thus explaining why he has no mother. Francis also explained that in time he will be given a \\"Francis\\" of his own to raise as Epsilon is raising him. He also showed a great disdain and bitterness over this fact, due to the massive amount of pressure it placed upon him. Zak tells him he's in charge of his own destiny and is his own person, not just another clone. Francis understands and allows Zak to escape instead of capturing him as a way to thank him (though he wouldn't admit it). =Maboul= * Voice Actor: Diedrich Bader Maboul is the father of Wadi and the chieftain of the Hassi who guard the Methuselah Tree (the source of all water on Earth). He disapproves of Wadi's kleptomaniac ways. In \\"Curse of the Stolen Tiger,\\" he has the Saturdays babysit Wadi while he is away on Hassi business. He is good friends with Drew Saturday. He and Wadi, as well as some members of the Hassi took part in the fight against the cryptids controlled by V.V. Argost. =Wadi= * Voice Actor: Liliana Mumy Wadi is the daughter of Maboul and Zak's love interest. Wadi is a kleptomaniac, which her father disapproves of (even though after the events of \\"Eterno\\", she has vowed to recover stolen property). In \\"Eterno\\", she steals a salt crystal which inadvertently awakens the salt creature Eterno. She aids Zak in stopping it, building a love-hate friendship. She later assists the Saturdays in reclaiming a village's stolen blue tiger from Shoji Fuzen, with Wadi helping to defeat him by stealing a component from Shoji's high-tech armor that controls its flight capability. All of Zak's family thought that he has a crush on her due to his being very clumsy around her (which turned out to be true), which he vehemently denies until she admits she thinks he's cute, which he immediately blushes at. She has a peculiar habit of stealing Zak's belt. In the episode \\"Life in The Underground\\", Wadi shows that she has a crush on Zak and gives him a kiss on the cheek. She has also copied his idea of \\"the claw\\" with a yo-yo shown in \\"Life in the Underground\\". Zak also has a crush on her that becomes more obvious in each episode she's there. She is around Zak's age (11-13). Wadi participated alongside her tribe in \\"War Of The Cryptids\\" alongside the rest of the Hassi. =Tsul 'Kalu= A skilled cryptid warrior, known for his devotion to catch his targets no matter what. Years ago he challenged Doc to a fight due to an accident caused by Zak which destroyed an archeological place guarded by him. In the ensuing fight, Doc won but at the cost of a blinded eye and a scar on his face. As a token of honor Tsul 'Kalu gave him his amulet, a claw, which was to be used later on Zak's weapon. In the present he tracked Zak down, having learned that he is Kur and tried to reclaim the amulet, not wanting it to be used for evil purposes. After losing the battle against Zak, he was able to see his true intentions and permitted Zak to use the power of the Claw. He is now an ally of the Saturdays and assisted in the fight against an army of cryptids. In 'And Your Enemies Closer', he helped keep Zak from getting killed by Argost and Munya. He fought and defeated Munya in 'War of the Cryptids.' =Dr. Pachacutec= *Voice Actor: Candi Milo A member of the Secret Scientists who is seen in \\"Eterno\\". She and the other scientists were at the meeting and discovered that the rivers have turned to salt in the Middle East of Arab. She and the other scientists helped Zak, Wadi, and Fiskerton to get the sap from the Methuselah Tree. Once they returned to the surface, Zak accidentally dropped the bottle (that had the sap) and some of the sap then destroyed the salt bonds on Drew. Dr. Pachacutec shows Zak that the sap is breaking Drew's bonds. However, once Eterno quenches his thirst, his body crumbles to pieces of salt. Doc then saw the flower which used to have the sap and said that he'll have Pachacutec analyze it, since if the Scientists were able to synthesize the flower, they might be able to reverse the effects of what Eterno did. Once the sap is synthesized and all of the people are free from their salt bonds, Dr. Pachacutec said that the scientists will deal with the waters that are still salt. =Dr. David Bara= *Voice Actor: Clancy Brown A member of the Secret Scientists who is seen in \\"Shadows of Lemuria\\" and \\"And Your Enemies Closer\\". In his first appearance, he uses his Dream-Time Totem to put Fiskerton to sleep in order to find the motivation behind his instinctual behavior. Argost sends a neaural parasite to control Fiskerton. After Drew told David to not let anyone in, she left, but Zak enters the room and attacks Dr. Bara. Dr. Bara tried to put him to sleep, but did not succeed. The parasite then attaches itself to Fiskerton in order to control him, but Fiskerton was fighting back. An army of Fisk-Bots broke in and destroyed the Saturdays' headquarters. After Zak defeated the parasite, the Fisk-Bots used parts of the headquarters that resembles the globe of the diving rod. When the Saturdays head to Antarctica, David Bara said he'll find his way home. In his second appearance, he was one of the scientists that are trying to capture a Revolving Beast. =Dr. Odele= *Voice Actor: Phil Morris A member of the Secret Scientists who is specialized in anomalic weather. In \\"The Kur Stone\\", he told Doc that Henry has been fatally wounded by the explosion (that was caused by Argost's firecracker beetles), but said that he'll be alright. He also believes that Argost is heading to Manaus, Brazil. He also suggested the Saturdays to leave Zak with him, while the rest of them get the last piece of the Kur Stone. This made Zak upset, but Doc suggested that Zak will stay with his family. In \\"The King of Kumari Kandam\\", he called the Saturdays to inform them that the citizens of Kumari Kandam attacked him and his people somewhere at the South Indian Ocean. In \\"Eterno\\", he was seen at the meeting with the other scientists. =Tiacapan= *Voice Actor: Jessica DiCicco Tiacapan is a young Mexican girl (around 11-12) who is seen in \\"The Thousand Eyes of Ahuizotl\\". Her village was terrorized by the monster known as Ahuizotl. She told the Saturdays that Ahuizotl is a nocturnal cryptid and steals the eyes from the living as if Ahuizotl is blind. She even explained that Ahuizotl was resting in its tomb, but awakens for unknown reasons after about 6 months had passed. She also said that her people are using Miranda as a sacrifice to the beast, because they don't want Ahuizotl to steal theirs. Due to feeling that it's wrong to do something like this, Zak explains that people do a lot of things when they're scared. Tica also said there's still time before Miranda gets her eyes taken by the creature. She gives them masks to prevent the Ahuizotl from stealing their eyes. Once they reach to a pyramid, they find Miranda bound and gagged with the Ahuizotl preparing to steal her eyes. Zak, however, uses his powers to battle the beast. He tells Tica to evacuate the villagers. Once Ahuizotl was defeated, the Saturdays decided to leave Miranda in Mexico, until Tica knows that they're all cleared. =Swamp Cryptids= *Voice Actors: Dee Bradley Baker (Honey Island Swamp Monster and Georgia Pigman), Uncredited (Lake Worth Monster) A group of 13 hominid cryptids (consisting of Momo, Bishopville Lizard Man, the Honey Island Swamp Monster, Lake Worth Monster, Kinchafoonee Creep, Georgia Pigman, Bardin Booger, Man Cat, Devil Monkey, Green Goon, Hawley Him, Mississippi Swamp Ape, and the Fouke Monster) that appeared in \\"Ghost in the Machine\\". They live on Honey Island, Louisiana and they seem to be based on the real-life reported ones (although some could be made up). They work for the deceased Basil Lancaster (a friend of Doc). These cryptids attacked Zak, Komodo, and Fiskerton when they were wandering into the swamp and were nearly eaten by oversized alligators. They also attacked Drew and Doc in the lab, due to believing that they were restarting the project. However, Zak, Komodo, and Fiskerton were captured by Dr. Lee and his scientists and mutated them into a cryptid known as the Saturday Hybrid/Zakermodo. When the cryptid hybrid escapes, the swamp cryptids begin to destroy the lab and Doc and Drew went after him. The Devil Monkey and the Fouke Monster were holding away Doc and Drew as the Lake Worth Monster grabs the Zakermodo, until he heard Drew saying \\"Zak Saturday\\". The Lake Worth Monster then releases the Saturday Hybrid, heads to one of the cabins and shows a picture of young Doc/Solomon with the deceased Dr. Basil Lancaster and a message from Lancaster. Once Dr. Lee and the scientists are captured, the cryptids leave the machine alone so Doc and Drew can turn the cryptid hybrid back to Zak, Fiskerton, and Komodo back to normal. The Lake Worth Monster then reveals a radio as Doc turns it on to hear the message from Lancaster. The message reveals that Basil Lancaster and the other scientists created these cryptids. The cryptids were actually once human beings, but their DNA were mixed with animal DNA. Lancaster knew that what he did was wrong, as he then betrayed Dr. Lee and destroyed enough of their research in order to cripple the project. The cryptids were saved by Lancaster and they went into hiding, but they stayed behind in order to fully destroy the project. Honoring Dr. Lancaster's final request, the Saturdays and the cryptids destroy all that remained of the project. =Tibetan Monks= *Voice Actors: Phil Morris, Jeff Bennett A group of monks from the Himalayas. They were mentioned in \\"Van Rook's Apprentice\\" and make an actual appearance in \\"And Your Enemies Closer\\". Drew mentioned that after she was separated from her family, the Tibetan monks found her and raised her in their temple. After she got older, the monks gave her a Tibetan Fire Sword. In \\"And Your Enemies Closer\\", Doyle, Zon, and Van Rook visit the Himalayas and they find Drew. The monks arrived and welcomed Drew for returning to the Himalayas. In the temple, the monks were giving them tea. Van Rook was disgusted by the tea and asked how to say \\"taste like yak vomit\\" in Tibetan, causing one of the monks to hit him on the head. Doyle was telling Drew that Argost and Munya have captured Baron Finster, but wasn't sure why he abducted the Xing-Xing, but he knew it was also from the Himalayas. When they went outside, Doyle knew the area where they lost their parents. Drew thought it was the storm, but it was actually a mysterious cryptid that killed them and push Doyle to the village. Doyle thought the Xing-Xing was the creature that attacked his parents. Drew then told Doyle that they never knew that there was a cryptid in the Himalayas. The monks then looked at each other and Drew got upset at them that they knew and never told her. The monks told her that they couldn't bare to add one more nightmare in her troubled sleep. They said that the cryptid is called the Yeti and her parents were not its only victims in those days. They said that they tried to hunt it down countless times, but when they finally found its lair, the beast was gone. They then showed Drew and the others to the Yeti's lair. Doyle was still upset about the \\"orange Yeti freak\\" for letting it go. However, one of the monks said that the Yeti doesn't have orange fur, but is pure white with pale blue skin and they suggested it was not the cryptid he saw. =Bud Harger= *Voice Actor: Corey Burton A logger, who owns the Allegheny Mountains as his land. He's seen in \\"Food of the Giants\\". He and his three workers decided to make a city by cutting down trees, but one night, a large cryptid called the Allegewi attacked their campsite and abducts two of his workers. Harger called the Saturdays to help him search for his workers. He told Ruby to take the four-wheeler back to base camp and says to her that she'll be safe there. When the Saturdays were caught in strange traps, Harger showed up and also got caught. Abbey said that Harger caused the traps and was having the weapons sabotaged. However, it's later revealed that Abbey was the culprit, who's working for Van Rook (who sold the land to Harger). When the Allegewi attacks and knocks out Abbey, it saw the Saturdays and Harger in the traps. It looked at Abbey's unconscious body and left her, due to believing that she was dead. When the Allegewi released the Saturdays out of the traps, Harger thought it was letting them go and did not want to eat them. However, it's revealed that the Allegewi is a predatory thing and has to hunt its food. As the man-eating cryptid chases them (with Doyle carrying Abbey and Fiskerton carrying Zon as if her wings are injured), they climbed onto a tree with Drew chopping it with her sword and they seemingly outran the Allegewi. They later cover themselves in mud in order to keep the cryptid from eating them. When Harger offered to rub mud on Doyle, Doyle refuses and \\"knows what he's made of and it's not the stuff\\". The Saturdays then found one of Harger's men, Wyatt. As Wyatt explained that Cody is missing, the Allegewi returns. Later that night, the Saturdays were heading to the Allegewi's cave. While Harger was counting the \\"gorilla\\" and the \\"dino-bird\\" as one, making nine, which made Fiskerton and Zon (who's carried in a basket) yell at him, Zak warns him to count them separately causing Harger to agree that it makes ten. As Doc and Doyle rescue Cody from the Allegewi, the three head outside with the cryptid chasing them. The group shoot catapults and spears at the Allegewi, which gives Fiskerton and Zon the chance to knock the Allegewi to a large net made of vines with Hickory sap (which was Zak's idea). When they planned to relocate the Allegewi to another location with plenty open land and zero human population, Abbey frees it. As the Allegewi attacks, Abbey tells Doyle and Zak to tell their family that \\"she's sorry\\" as she pushes them out of the way and the Allegewi attacks her, causing her and the beast to fall into a chasm, but Abbey doesn't die. With the Allegewi defeated, Harger and his workers head back to their camp. Ruby, Cody, and Wyatt *Voice Actors: Kari Wahlgren (Ruby), Phil Morris (Wyatt), Diedrich Bader (Cody) Three loggers who work for Bud Harger. Two of the workers (Cody and Wyatt) were captured by an Allegewi. When Wyatt escaped from the beast's lair, he led the Saturdays in an attempt to rescue Cody. When they reached the Allegewi's lair, the cryptid tries to catch Cody, who's hiding in a crevice. They managed to rescue him and defeat the Allegewi (thanks to Abbey, who lured it to a chasm). =Dr. Basil Lancaster= *Voice Actor: Fred Tatasciore A scientist, who was a friend of Doc Saturday when he was young. He was seen in \\"Ghost in the Machine\\". He and Doc worked with Dr. Lee and three unnamed scientists with a machine to create cryptids on Honey Island Swamp. However, the project went out of control as the cryptids were mutated humans. He knew his conscience was wrong and it took too long to listen. Dr. Basil Lancaster betrayed Dr. Lee by destroying enough of their research to cripple the project, saved the cryptids and fled to the bayou. As his colleagues went into hiding, he left Honey Island, knowing that the cryptids will destroy the project and the machine that created them. However, as years passed, Lancaster died. However, he did left Doc a message to reveal what Honey Island was really about. Honoring Lancaster's final request, the Saturdays and the cryptids destroy all that remained of the project. Dr. Lee and the other three scientists are sent to prison by the US Army. Doc also takes the photo that shows a younger version of him and Lancaster. The message ends that Lancaster knows that Doc is a better man. Villains and antagonists =V.V. Argost= * Voice Actor: Corey Burton V.V. Argost is the series' main villain and the archenemy of the Saturdays. He is the host of V.V. Argost's Weirdworld, a series that made him \\"the modern master of the bizarre\\" of the Earth. With an extensive knowledge of cryptids as well as a showy and dramatic personality, Argost's overall goal is the possession of Kur and the power it holds. Having hid his true nature well, Argost is actually a Yeti that had been attacking humans out of enjoyment in the Himalayas and often took items from their camp as souvenirs. According to Jay Stephens, one of the 'souvenirs' Argost had taken from a camp he had attacked was a television, from which he learned to speak English. Argost then resolves to live among humans by influencing them with a television show of his own. Donning a Megatooth shark skin cloak and mask, Argost lived on the streets before acquiring the funding he needed from Baron Finster in return for his scorpion lower body. In \\"Kur Rising\\", Argost takes control of a creature he and the Saturdays believe to be Kur before the monster is defeated and he is taken to safety by Munya when his mask started to cracked after taking enough blows from Zak, who is revealed to be the host of the actual Kur. Throughout the second season, while using Munya to give the Saturdays the notion that he had died, Argost went into hiding before saving Zak from Rani Nagi and offered to help him hone his Kur powers. However, as was revealed in \\"Legion of Garuda\\", Argost possesses the flute of Gilgamesh with the intent to extract Zak's power while obtaining an orange ape-like cryptid from his past during the episode \\"Return of Tsul\\". During the episode \\"And Your Enemies Closer\\", as Dolye and Drew eventually learn of his true nature and his role in their parents' death in the Himalayas, Argost kidnaps Zak and takes him to an island where he revealed that during the events of \\"Into The Mouth of Darkness\\" when he hacked into the Saturdays' airship computer in a search for a means to extract Zak's Kur powers, he learned about the existence of the Saturdays' evil counterparts, the Mondays. The research had Argost realize that Zak Monday is logically the Anti-Kur, so he stole the Smoke Mirror of Tezcatlipoca from the Paris museum to bring the anti-matter Zak into their reality in order to siphon the Anti-Kur into himself. Once the ritual is completed, since he is now immune to Zak's powers, Argost destroys the relics to keep his new powers while revealing his true identity. Soon after, in the series finale \\"War Of The Cryptids,\\" Argost set his plans into motion, unleashing a gigantic cryptid army all over the Earth. However, his arrogance proves to be his undoing when he siphons Zak's powers in an attempt to amplify his own, having obtained an electronic sound-system that recreated a weaponized version of the Flute Of Gilgamesh. Unable to hear Zak's warning of the danger when it comes to combining matter and anti-matter energies, Argost finds himself imploding from the two Kurs' energies and is presumed dead. However, it is revealed that in the crossover episode \\"T.G.I.S\\" of Omniverse that Argost was actually thrown into a state of anti-matter flux from the Kur energies. But Argost had set up a back-up plan with Dr. Animo in order to be revived through the use of cryptid and alien DNA. But once he was revived, Argost was initially displeased to find his body had been turned into a chimeric amalgamation. But Argost quickly finds his new body is to his advantage when he seeks revenge on Zak and is thrilled to learn that he still has the powers of the anti-matter Kur which allows him to control an army of mutant cryptids with a single thought. Ultimately he is defeated once again through the teamwork of Zak and Ben Tennyson, the later of whom manages to drain Argost's powers. Munya * Voice Actor: Fred Tatasciore Munya is V.V. Argost's servant, injected with the DNA of a spider, enabling him to transform into a half-human/half-spider monster in battles. In this form, he gains superhuman strength, is able to climb walls, and can fire thick streams of webbing from his mouth. Following Argost's defeat at Antarctica, Munya wrapped up Argost in webbing and made off with him. In \\"Kur\\" Pt. 2, Munya was using a special typewriter called a \\"text to speech engine\\" to help promote V.V. Argost's return. After learning that Doyle was searching for his secrets, Argost had Munya hunt down every person that was connected to his past on his orders, including Baron Finister. In the episode \\"And Your Enemies Closer\\", it was shown that Munya had enough cryptid DNA to be controlled by Zak. In \\"War of the Cryptids\\", Munya led an attack on Paris as part of Argost's army only to be defeated by Tsul 'Kalu, shortly after Argost's downfall. Munya is once again at his master's side upon his revival by Dr Animo in the crossover episode \\"T.G.I.S\\" of Ben 10 Omniverse and also confronts Zak when he discovers Animo's lair, but is defeated in the ensuing fight. =Abbey Grey= * Voice Actor: Kari Wahlgren Once Zak's babysitter, Abbey Grey is an ancient civilization expert and Miranda Grey's sister. She appears in \\"The Kur Guardian\\", helping Zak, Doyle, and Fiskerton in learning about Fiskerton's Lemurian roots. She and Doyle begin dating at the end of the episode, only for him to discover in \\"Food of the Giants\\" that Van Rook hired her not long after Doyle quit. She admits her feelings for Doyle were real, but still intends to finish the Saturdays off. In \\"Kur Pt. 1\\", Leonidas Van Rook mentioned to Doyle that Abbey Grey took over his business. Later it is revealed that she is much better in the field of mercenary work than Van Rook since not only does she make more money but also is able to buy higher grade equipment due to her not being as much of a cheap skate as her former teacher. Also it's shown that she, like her teacher, has come under the employment of Argost. =Rani Nagi= * Voice Actor: Susan Blakeslee Rani Nagi is a four-armed Naga and the queen of her race. She can control any type of snake and speak through them. Her species is able to speak and breathe underwater. When V.V. Argost captures Fiskerton, he calls her in to see if Fiskerton is Kur. She uses a relic forged from Kur's own essence which is said to glow in the presence of its master. When the artifact fails to glow, Argost asks her why the picture of Fiskerton was in Kur's tomb. She identifies him as a Lemurian, saying he can lead Argost to Kur. She then leaves before Doc charges in to face Argost. She later follows Zak, Doyle, Fiskerton, and Abby to Shangri-La in order to learn where Kur is located. After a brutal battle in which she mostly holds her own against the family, she is finally defeated by Fiskerton. She is seen later in \\"The Atlas Pin\\", where she is using her Kur-sensing relic around Kur's tomb, only for it to be stolen by Argost so he can use it to find Kur. She enlists the Saturdays' aid in retrieving her stolen relic by threatening to remove the Atlas Pin should they refuse to comply. Drew, Zak, and Komodo manage to stop her with help from Kumari Kandam, though she and her followers escape capture while Doc, Doyle, Fiskerton, and Zon recovered the artifact. However, when Drew learned that the Nagas were dark mystics, she says the relic must be destroyed which Fiskerton does. However, Doyle covertly recovers the pieces and repairs it. The relic plays a big part in the 1st-season finale as it identifies Zak as Kur. Rani Nagi and her fellow Nagas returned in the season two premiere \\"Kur\\" as the main villains. After it was revealed that Zak is Kur, the Nagas sought him out while calling him their master. Rani attempted to convince Zak to tap into his inner nature and lead all cryptids in a war against humanity. Her attempt was interrupted by the timely arrival of the rest of the family and after a rough battle, they saved Zak and escaped. However, the Nagas had already succeeded in having Zak's power summon the most vicious cryptids from around the planet in a battle against humans. She and the other Nagas lead the army in the name of Kur. During the attack upon Manhattan, Rani Nagi was knocked away by V.V. Argost. Rani Nagi and her Nagas had possession of the Flute of Gilgamesh which Zak and Fiskerton stole. When Zak's life was threatened by Gokul using the Flute of Gilgamesh on him, she and her fellow Nagas helped the Saturdays and the scientists that were after Zak stop Gokul. In \\"War of the Cryptids,\\" Rani Nagi and her Nagas side with V.V. Argost after he claims the Anti-Kur powers from Zak Monday. She was responsible for using Drew's sword to attack her only for Leonidas to sacrifice his life by blocking the attack. She was later knocked out by the Saturdays after V.V. Argost imploded. =Shoji Fuzen= * Voice Actor: James Sie Shoji Fuzen is a Japanese philanthropist who is also Japan's biggest crime lord. He tries to obtain a mind-swapping device invented by Talu Mizuki to transfer the mind of one of his followers into a Hibagon (a large, ape-like cryptid). Mizuki instead transfers his own mind into the creature, then goes on a rampage of revenge against Fuzen. The Saturdays convince Mizuki to abandon his revenge and send Fuzen to jail for his crimes. He returns in the second season as a Chinese warlord after escaping from prison. He and his henchmen steal a luck-granting blue tiger from a small village. He is also now armed with a samurai-themed suit of high-tech armor, which he uses while engaging the Saturdays. During the battle, Fuzen is knocked off a cliff by Doc after Wadi steals a component from the suit which it needs for flight. It is unknown if Shoji Fuzen survived the fall. =Piecemeal= * Voice Actor: Jess Harnell Pietro \\"Piecemeal\\" Maltese is a criminally-insane chef with an appetite for rare animals. He has a surgically modified jaw made of four metal flaps which can bite through almost anything. He has above-average strength and durability, as he is able to knock out Fiskerton with a single punch and survive a direct blast from Drew's fire sword without injury. He attacks the Saturday household in order to devour Fiskerton, but is repelled by Zak using his mother's fire sword. In \\"Target: Fiskerton\\", he is hired by V.V. Argost to help Leonidas Van Rook capture Fiskerton. Pietro instead tries to eat Fiskerton during the conflict on the train, so Argost uses a neuroparasite to knock him unconscious. =Baron Finster= * Voice Actor: Rob Paulsen Baron Finster is a half man/half robotic scorpion villain that Doyle once claimed to have fought. In his story, Doyle rescued a Ngani-vatu from him then rode the beast to safety. Doc calls the plausibility of the story into question and it seems likely that Doyle was exaggerating to entertain Zak. In \\"Cryptid vs Cryptid,\\" Doyle later fought Baron Finster in the arctic and managed to defeat him and his henchmen, thereby proving that the villain at least does exist. On the Viral website Ten Hero Tusk, there is an egg that was provided by Baron that shows that he is a Cryptozoologist like Van Rook. In \\"Into the Mouth of Darkness\\" Doyle and van Rook capture him to get information about Argost, but he is taken away by Munya. They did manage to find out that Argost designed Baron Finster's robotic scorpion body in exchange for funding for Weird World as well as the fact that Argost was once a very poor man. =The Mondays= The Mondays are the Saturdays' evil antimatter duplicates from a parallel universe, summoned by the Smoke Mirror of Tezcatlipoca. They are not well liked in their reality, most likely being criminals. Each Monday has a distinguishing characteristic that sets them apart from the Saturdays and cause reality to warp when in the presence of their duplicates. The name Monday was given to them by Zak Saturday since, according to him, his double is a \\"less fun version of a Saturday\\", hence a Monday. The Mondays accidentally banish themselves back to their own universe while fighting over the mirror. The Saturdays leave and fail to notice that Zak Monday and Komodo Monday escaping from the mirror while leaving the others behind, even when Drew Monday purposely threatened her son even though he's out of sight and can't hear her. In \\"Paris is Melting\\", the evil Zak and Komodo attempt to threaten Zak into retrieving their airship from the antimatter universe following their attack on Dr. Cheechoo, Dr. Lawhorn, and Dr. Grimes. Zak recovers it for them, but makes a deal with the rest of the Monday family while doing so. Zak drains the ship's power with their help before returning, causing it to crash back into the repaired Smoke Mirror of Tezcatlipoca when the evil Zak and Komodo attempt to fly it. They are about to get beaten up by the family they left in the mirror. It is not known if whether or not Doyle has an evil counterpart like the rest of the Saturdays. It's most likely that Monday isn't really their last names, as Zak Monday had asked \\"Is that what you call us?\\" in \\"Paris is Melting\\", since technically, Zak (Saturday) made up the name. Zak Monday returned in 'And Your Enemies Closer', where Argost tricked him so he could steal his power with the Flute of Gilgamesh. Afterwards, Argost smashed both the flute and Smoke Mirror, trapping the other Mondays in their reality forever. Zak Monday * Voice Actor: Sam Lerner His hair color reversed from Zak Saturday's along with his eyes glowing green when using his power with his Fang weapon, Zak Monday possesses the Anti-Kur power and uses it to drive cryptids insane rather than calming them. While Zak Saturday respects life, Zak Monday disregards it and has shown to be sadistic. Out of all the Monday family members, Zak Monday was the most reoccurring alongside Komodo Monday before they are sent back to their universe. However, in 'And Your Enemies Closer' when summoned back to his counterpart's reality in what he later learned was a trap, Zak Monday is killed off when Argost uses the Flute of Gilgamesh to absorb the Anti-Kur spirit from him. Doc Monday * Voice Actor: Phil Morris Solomon \\"Doc\\" Monday's scarred eye is on the opposite side and he wears an eye patch over it. He usually speaks in incoherent babbling and has a much lower intellect than his counterpart. As shown in \\"Paris Is Melting\\", he has a power glove like Doc's, but it is gray and black, as well as fingerless and left-handed. Drew Monday * Voice Actor: Nicole Sullivan Drew Monday has a long, prehensile tongue, but is otherwise similar to her counterpart. She is more rationally scientific than her counterpart. Whereas Drew Saturday comes off as rough but loves Zak, Drew Monday acts sweetly but hates Zak. Her sword shoots ice instead of fire like her counterpart. Fiskerton Monday * Voice Actor: Diedrich Bader Fiskerton Monday has horns in place of ears and is much more vicious than his counterpart. Komodo Monday * Voice Actor: Fred Tatasciore impersonating George Sanders Komodo Monday is capable of human speech and seems to be the leader of the group, when they're not fighting amongst themselves. He possesses black spots on his back which he can expand to cover his entire body and harden his skin. Zon Monday * Voice Actor: Fred Tatasciore Zon Monday has eye-like patterns on her wings, but otherwise behaves almost exactly like Zon Saturday. =Kur= Kur is an ancient cryptid said to be a source of unlimited power and immortality for whoever can find and capture it, with the first season focusing on it due to its ability to control all other cryptids. The Saturdays and Argost are eventually led to Antarctica by Fiskerton, where they discover an ancient behemoth frozen in the ice. Believing this was the creature he sought, Argost took control of the cryptid from the inside and commanded its army of cryptid parasites, forcing Zak and Fiskerton to follow him into it. While inside, Zak's powers seemed to be stronger than ever and after a lengthy battle, he used his powers to bring down the behemoth that was believed to be Kur. However, the actual Kur is revealed to be Zak as a result of the mystic energies infused in Zak while he was in the womb. With the added revelation that any attempt to remove the Kur spirit would kill him, Zak became targeted by various parties who would use his powers to their ends. One among them was Argost before he learned of Zak Monday and absorbed the Anti-Kur spirit, though Argost's greed got the better of them when he absorbed the Kur spirit from Zak. Because the two Kur spirits are within one body, Argost implodes from the strain with both spirits seemingly destroyed. However, as revealed in the Ben 10: Omniverse series, Argost was revealed to have actually been thrown into a state of anti-matter flux with Kur's powers eventually returning to Zak once the flux ends. =Eterno= *Voice Actor: Fred Tatasciore Eterno is the Salt Man that appears in \\"Eterno\\". He was once an ancient warrior king, whose thirst for conquest could not be quenched. He also attempts to find the Methuselah Tree (a tree that makes all the water on Earth). He, however, failed and was instead entombed in salt by the tree's protectors, who resemble giant purple centipedes. As time passed, he became pure salt, but was awakened by water that touched him. After his awakening, he begins to turn the oceans into salt. Touching anything or anyone with his right hand will turn them to salt, but his left hand doesn't appear to have an effect. The Methuselah Tree is the only thing that is immune to his touch. He turns the rivers of the Middle East into salt and has trapped all of the villagers (which are the Hassi who are guardians of the Mother River, the supposed source of all the water on Earth) in shells of salt, including their Chief (Maboul). He also trapped Drew in a likewise salt shell. He makes a deal for Zak to get the sap from the tree and bring it to him and he'll turn everyone back to the way they were. He also tried to attack Zak, Wadi, and Fiskerton when they were searching for the tree, but left. Doc fought him for turning his wife into salt and Eterno turned his left leg into salt. Even when smashing Eterno into pieces, he forms himself back (saying he is eternal, while Doc states that nobody lives forever). The tree's protectors arrived (with Zak controlling them) and he accidentally dropped a bottle that had the sap in it. Wadi also took one of the flowers from the tree and it made the protectors angry. Wadi throws it to Zak and he tries to get all of the victims turn back to normal, but Eterno turns the protectors to salt and snatches the flower from Zak and drinks the sap. Zak and Doc try to stop him, but it was too late. Eterno lets out a satisfied \\"Ah!\\" as his body crumbles into pieces of salt, his thirst finally quenched. =Ron Bantington= *Voice Actor: Jeff Bennett Ron Bantington is the head of Bantington Industrial who is seen in \\"Kur\\". He was the biggest corporate sponsor of TV's Weird World, while also being involved in many illegal activities. Doyle tracked him down to a restaurant in London, England to see if Bantington knew any evidence of Argost. Bantington tells Doyle that he's a sponsor and apparently doesn't make the show. Doyle asked Baintington if he's trying to tell him that bad guys never really 'pal' around together. Ron said that he doesn't know where Argost has disappeared to, but wished he knew because Argost is his 'biggest money-maker' and said he knew one thing: his kind of people do like to 'pal' around together. He and his gang all tried to stop Doyle, but he and Zon managed to defeat him and his minions. =Gokul= *Voice actor: Corey Burton A magician from India who can create illusions and summon images into the minds of his enemies. His group of people, long ago, performed a ritual that would defeat Kur. He lured the Saturdays by using an illusion of a young girl. He involves to help the Saturdays to destroy Kur if they could get the Flute of Gilgamesh from the Nagas. Once they got the flute and head to the ceremony, Gokul uses it and the flute begins to drain Zak's powers. However, it was revealed midway that driving Kur's spirit out of Zak will kill him, since he is Kur himself rather than someone possessed. Gokul tells them that Kur's powers were too great, angering the Saturdays. The Secret Scientists and the Nagas arrive to save him from being killed. Gokul makes illusions of stone walls, but the Saturdays and the Scientists knew that the walls were nothing more than an illusion. However, the images Gokul creates next are a mixture of both reality and illusion, but Deadbolt is able to tell the difference. Once Deadbolt makes through the maze, he tries to save Zak, but Gokul destroys him by throwing a large spear. Gokul then creates an illusion of a gigantic hawk that scares the Nagas away, but Rani Nagi doesn't flee. Gokul then creates an illusion of fire, but the Saturdays, the Scientists, and Rani Nagi save Zak from being killed. Gokul then gives up and escapes. =Michel Grosshomme= *Voice Actor: Brian George An overweight man who is the biggest illegal cryptid trader on the Earth. He only appears in \\"The Return of Tsul Kalu\\". Baron Finster told Doyle, Van Rook, and Zon to follow the cryptids. Doyle, Van Rook, and Zon tracked him at the Black Market of Morocco to see if he knows anything about Argost's past. Once the guards were defeated, they find several cryptids in cages and tanks (Zon was interested in eating the aquatic sea scorpion-like cryptids). Grosshomme was in his office (with three cryptids) and having some \\"exquisite\\" dumplings. Van Rook and Doyle caught him. Once Doyle tried one of the dumplings, he said it tasted good and asked what it was made of. Abbey arrived and tells him that the dumplings were made out of a panda bear. Doyle spat the dumpling out and yells at Grosshomme for eating something made out of an endangered animal. While Grosshomme was eating more of his dumplings, Argost and Munya arrived and Grosshomme becomes terrified (even when Abbey said she could deliver him). Zon arrives and attacks Argost, Munya, and Abbey while Doyle creates a cloud of smoke from his jetpack. Doyle and Van Rook tell Grosshomme to come with them if he wants to live, then asks him if he knows about Argost's past. However, three cryptids escaped and Grosshomme forced Doyle to take them with him because they're apparently worth a fortune. While they were hiding, Grosshomme was eating a kabob and the fish cryptid escaped. Once Doyle defeats Abbey and gets the fish cryptid back, he sees Zon and Van Rook fighting Munya and Grosshomme was on a roof of a building with the two primate cryptids and Argost was about to take one of them, but Doyle kicks Argost off the roof. Doyle tells Grosshomme to quit playing \\"zookeeper\\" and tells him to set the cryptids loose if he wants to eat another kabob, in which Grosshomme then releases them. Doyle then tells Van Rook and Zon to fly Grosshomme to safety while he holds off Argost. As Zon and Van Rook quickly fly Grosshomme to safety, Argost's actual target is the orange primate cryptid. =Dr. Lee= *Voice Actor: Diedrich Bader A villainous scientist who is a colleague of Basil Lancaster and young Doc Saturday in a project to create cryptids within Honey Island Swamp. When the project went out of control, Dr. Lancaster betrayed him and the other three scientists by destroying enough of their research to cripple the project, saved the cryptids and fled to the bayou. Years later, they used technology to create a ghost of the late Basil Lancaster to lure the Saturdays to Honey Island Swamp and use \\"Basil's ghost\\" to make Doc restart the project. Dr. Lee and his men then knock out Zak, Fiskerton, and Komodo with sleeping gas and abduct them so they could place them in a machine to mutate them. Once the machine was activated, the three Saturdays morph together into a monstrous cryptid: the Zakermodo/Saturday Hybrid. When Doc and Drew confronted Dr. Lee and his men, they revealed that they turned their boys into a cryptid. Drew tried to get their attention, but Dr. Lee explained that there are three brains in one head trying to work together and it makes them confused. Doc grabs Dr. Lee and threatens him with his glove while telling him to fix his dirty work. Dr. Lee said he would if Doc will agree to continue the project. However, the two refused and Drew said that they will figure out the machine, but Doc told Drew if the machine gets damaged, the boys could be stuck that way forever. Soon, the 13 cryptids that were created by the machine years ago, arrive when they hear the Zakermodo screaming and destroy the machine. Dr. Lee becomes frightened and ordered the cryptids to stay away, since he and the other scientists made them. However, the cryptids would not listen and the Zakermodo breaks free. When Doc and Drew head to the swamp to catch him, four of the cryptids pull the two away as the Lake Worth Monster grabs the Saturday Hybrid, believing he's one of them. However, when the cryptid heard Drew calling out her son's name, he releases him, heads to one of the cabins and reveals a photo of young Doc and Dr. Lancaster and a message recorded in a radio. When the Saturdays and the cryptids head back to the lab, the machine wasn't damaged and Dr. Lee was forced to turn the Saturday Hybrid back to normal. After the boys returned to normal and hear the message from Lancaster, the Saturdays and the cryptids destroy the machine and all that remains of the project. Dr. Lee and the three scientists were then sent to prison by the US Army.

The writer received Sahitya Akademi Award for this novel in 1976. She wrote the novel in response to Romanian philosopher Mircea Eliade's book La Nuit Bengali (titled Bengal Nights in English), which related a fictionalized account of their romance during Eliade's visit to India. Background and publication Mircea Eliade came to study under Maitreyi Devi's father in Kolkata in 1930. She was 16 then, and Eliade 23. Her father was very proud of his daughter's intelligence and provided her with a liberal education unthinkable during that time in India. He even encouraged Mircea and Maitreyi to study together. Devi later wrote, \\"We were two good exhibits in his museum\\". During this time Mircea and Maitreyi became close to each other. On discovering their secret romance her father ordered Mircea to leave their house. Based on their relationship, Mircea's novel in Romanian Maitreyi was published in 1933. Shortly after it was translated into French and published with the title La Nuit Bengali, it became a huge success. Maitreyi Devi's father found out about the book during his 1938-39 Europe tour and passed the information to his daughter upon returning home. In 1953, during her own Europe tour, Devi came across several Romanians who told her that they recognized her name from Mircea's novel. These encounters further piqued Devi's interest in reading the novel, though she was still unaware of the novel's full content. In 1972, Sergiu Al-George, a close friend of Mircea, came to Kolkata and told Maitreyi about the details of the book, informing her that the book described a sexual relationship between her and Mircea. Devi asked a friend to translate the novel from French and was shocked to find how it depicted their relationship. Through Na Hanyate, Maitreyi Devi responded to Mircea's novel and countered his fantasies. In 1973, Maitreyi Devi was invited by Chicago University to give lectures on Rabindranath Tagore. She went to Mircea Eliade's, who was a professor in the same university, office unannounced. During the next two months of her stay, they met several times, which was condensed to a single one at the end of her book. She confronted him about the claims he wrote in his book and, as a result, Mircea promised the book would not be published in English in her lifetime. Four years after her death in 1990, the University of Chicago Press published it in English titled Bengal Nights. Although La Nuit Bengali was published in 1933, it was several years before Devi discovered it. Though the two books relate a common event, they differ in many aspects of their plots and perspectives. Taken together, the New York Times describes the two novels as \\"an unusually touching story of young love unable to prevail against an opposition whose strength was tragically buttressed by the uncertainties of a cultural divide.\\" In 1994, the University of Chicago Press published the two works in English as companion volumes. Adaptation The novel was loosely adapted as the 1999 Hindi language film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. although the film does not give credit to it. The film was a huge hit because of its melodramatic picturisation.

Ordained in 1848, he became a key figure in organizing the Norwegian Synod.\\"Preus, Herman Amberg\\". In Christian Cyclopedia. Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod. Background Herman Amberg Preus was born in Kristiansand, Norway. He was the son of Paul Arctander Preus, headmaster at the Cathedral School in Kristiansand and Anne Keyser, whose father was Johan Keyser, the Bishop of Kristiansand in the Church of Norway. Herman attended the Cathedral School in Kristiansand. He was educated in theology, graduating from the University of Oslo in Oslo in 1848. The same year he was ordained an Evangelical Lutheran pastor by the bishops of the state Church of Norway.Preus, Herman Amberg 1825 - 1894 (Wisconsin Historical Society) Career During May 1851, Preus and Caroline Keyser were married and subsequently immigrated to the United States. Preus was installed as the pastor of Spring Prairie Lutheran Church in Columbia County, Wisconsin during August 1851. In 1853, he was one of seven pastors organizing the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Preus served as president of the Norwegian Synod from 1862 until his death in 1894.Rolf David Preus. \\"The Legacy of Herman Amberg Preus\\". Known for his strict adherence to the doctrine of the state Church of Norway, Preus was a leader of the conservative group in the doctrinal and theological disputes among the early Scandinavian-American Lutherans. Preus was associate editor of the synod newspaper, Maanedstidende (1861‚Äì1868) and was the author of two books on Norwegian-American Lutheranism published in 1867 and 1875. Preus had a significant part in the founding of St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. Preus laid the foundation stone of the St. Olaf on July 4, 1877.James S. Hamre. \\"Three Spokesmen for Norwegian Lutheran Academies: Schools for Church, Heritage, Society\\". Norwegian-American Studies, vol. 30, p. 221. Absolution and election controversies In 1874, the Norwegian Synod received charges of universalism from Professors A. Weenaas and Sven Oftedahl. Preus, president of the Norwegian Synod at that time, presented an essay in response to their claims. Among their claims was that a minister may not absolve a sinner with certainty, since he does not know the sinner‚Äôs faith. In response to these claims, Preus defended the doctrine of objective justification. In particular, he wrote: \\"According to his new gospel the professor must preach that through his suffering and death Christ has only accomplished so much that God has now become willing to let his wrath cease and to be reconciled and to loose, confer grace, forgive, justify and open access to salvation, but that in actuality he can only do and does all this if man on his part fulfills the condition placed on him by God, namely that he is supposed to believe. And the thing which is thus supposed to be believed does not become this that God already has done this and is reconciled but that God will do it and will be reconciled when he sees the obedience and the good quality in man, that he believes.\\"H. A. Preus. \\"The Justification of the World\\". February 13, 1874 The pastor does not know the sinner‚Äôs faith; besides God, only the individual truly knows his own faith. Preus agreed with this statement; however, when added to the premise that Christ's death brought justification only for those who believe in Him, the pastor would not be able to absolve the sins of anyone. Thus the issue at hand was that of objective justification or universal atonement (Unlimited Atonement). Did Christ's death bring justification to all people? Preus argued that it did. He held the doctrine of objective justification and God's promise in His Word to be the certainty of faith. He did not hold that the fruits of faith gave you confidence of legitimacy of your own faith; rather, fruits of faith, i.e. good works toward neighbor and confessing Christ before men, are only for the sake of helping your neighbor, thus proving to him‚Äînot to yourself‚Äîthat you have faith. Preus believed that faith is certainly necessary for salvation, but even that is given to us by God through his Word, as it is confessed in Article V of the Augsburg Confession of 1530, the prime doctrinal document of Evangelical Lutheran belief contained in the Book of Concord of 1580. Therefore, he held that a Christian can only look to God's Word and its promise of Christ's Vicarious Atonement on the cross for all mankind; if the Christian looks at the fruits of his faith for confidence, he only ends up looking at himself and away from Christ. Preus also pointed out that the unfaithfulness of the sinner does not cause God's absolution to be unfaithful, appealing to Romans 3:3: \\"For what if some did not believe? Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid.\\" Thus Preus held that a pastor can forgive in Christ's stead the sins of those who confess their sins even if he can not see the heart of the one confessing. The Norwegian Synod was a member of the conservative Synodical Conference, a church denominational confederation. The absolution controversy preceded the controversy on Election in the 1880s, which the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod was a part of as well.Wolf, Richard C. Documents of Lutheran Unity in America. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1966, pp. 198-206. Print. Herman Amberg Preus and his son, Christian Keyser Preus, were pastors together in the same Wisconsin parish when the election controversy erupted. The opposing side was teaching that God predestined His saints for salvation in view of their faith in Christ (intuitu fidei).Rolf David Preus. \\"The Legacy of Herman Amberg Preus\\". Preus and others, including C. F. W. Walther, one of the leading founders and first president of the theologically conservative Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod in 1847, took the position that the only cause that moved God to elect saints unto salvation is grace, and that election or predestination of saints to salvation is not the same as God's foreknowledge.Wolf, Richard C. Documents of Lutheran Unity in America. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1966, pp. 201-202. The Missourians were looked at as the leaders in the election controversy. When Preus and the other Norwegians supported the same position as Walther and Missouri, they were accused of loyalism to the Missouri Synod. The controversy became so fierce in the circles of the Norwegian Synod that on Good Friday, 1883, Herman and Christian were physically removed from their congregations. The Anti- Missourian Brotherhood, a group within the Norwegian Synod, had engineered their removal. They were later received back to their parish after most of the people were convinced of the correctness of Preus's position on election.Preus, Johan Carl Keyser.

Born in Jaffa, he and his family fled to Beirut at the onset of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. There, al-Hout became a journalist at al-Hawadth newspaper. Using it as a platform, he founded the Palestine Liberation Front in 1961 and later became a founder of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964. He remained a senior member of the organization, representing it in Lebanon and the United Nations General Assembly. Initially a close aid to Yasser Arafat, al-Hout resigned from his position on the PLO Executive Committee, in protest of Arafat's signing of the Oslo Accords. Early life =Life in Jaffa= Al-Hout was born in Jaffa in 1932 to the mayor of Jaffa at the time, known as the \\"Beiruti Mayor.\\" He belonged to the al-Hout family which had its roots in Lebanon; Shafiq's grandfather, Salim Youssef al-Hout, was originally from Beirut and immigrated to Jaffa in the late 19th century, settling in the Manshiyyah quarter. While Shafiq's five siblings were born at his grandfather's house, he was born in his parents' home. According to Shafiq, at their grandfather's home, he and his siblings \\"played [in] for hours on end... Not very far from my house was a sandy playground where we played football with our neighbors.\\"\\"Beiruti in Jaffa, Yafawi in Beirut\\": Shafiq al-Hout's story in his own words. Electronic Intifada. 4 August 2009. Al-Hout received his schooling up to high school at the al-Ameriyyah Public School in the same class of Ibrahim Abu-Lughod and Farouk Qaddoumi. He joined the boy scouts, and as a result, was able to form a clear picture about the institution. His first trip was to the Dead Sea. During his childhood, one of his hobbies was visiting movie theaters, which were located in different parts of Jaffa, and swimming in the beaches on the city's coastline. =Exodus to Lebanon= He graduated from al-Ameriyyah in 1948, and the same year al-Hout fled with his family to Lebanon at the onset of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Prior to their departure, in April, his brother Jamal, a Palestinian fighter who he described as \\"very spiritual\\", was killed. The al-Hout family was given a free visa by the Lebanese consul in Jaffa and boarded the Greek vessel Dolores Upon their arrival to Beirut, their Lebanese cousin received them and they stayed in his house temporarily before renting an apartment in the city. Locals began to call al-Hout al-Yafawi (\\"the man from Jaffa\\"). Al-Hout entered the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 1949.Llewellyn, Tim. Shafiq al-Hout: PLO founder member and staunch defender of Palestinian right The Guardian. 6 August 2009. While at the university, he said many people attempted to influence his political beliefs, including George Habash of the Arab Nationalist Movement and Communists who favored an alliance with Soviet Union. Al-Hout and his colleagues decided to establish a Palestinian club in Lebanon, but this was met by opposition from Hajj Amin al- Husayni's followers who at one time \\"severely beat\\" them in an ambush at a Palestinian refugee camp. Afterward, al-Hout decided to shift his focus to the AUB's campus where Ba'athists, other Arab nationalists, and Communists campaigned for support. He decided to join the Communists and in 1951 was detained for his activities by a presidential decree. He was sentenced to three months in prison and deportation from Lebanon, but his family convinced Lebanese prime minister Sami as-Solh to suspend the sentence. By then, al- Hout's father was forced to ask for UNRWA rations due to his financial situation and al-Hout was suspended from the AUB for one year. He would graduate from the university with a BA in psychology in 1953. Teaching and writing career After graduating from the AUB, he took up the profession of being a teacher in Beirut's al-Maqassed School, but the administration disliked the discussions he frequently held with the students on the subject of the Palestinian cause, and eventually removed him from his post. Prior to his emigration to Kuwait in 1956 for another teaching job,Palestinian Personalities - H Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs (PASSIA). al-Hout obtained Lebanese citizenship, despite reservations by his father. It was during his brief stay in Kuwait that he met Yasser Arafat and other Palestinian activists. Two years later, after correspondence with Salim al-Lawzi, he returned to Lebanon where he was given the post of chief editor at the Lebanese magazine al-Hawadeth run by al-Lawzi.Shafiq Al- Hout, PLO founder, dead at 77 Ma'an News Agency. 4 August 2009. He soon gained a reputation of being a Nasserist‚Äîa supporter of Egyptian president at the time, Gamal Abdel Nasser‚Äîjournalist. Political career =Founding of the PLF and PLO= Al-Hout was one of the founders of the Palestinian Liberation Front (PLF) in 1961, the Palestinian faction which he supported throughout his life. Through al-Hawadeth as a platform, al-Hout was able to start the underground political movement and issued a monthly newsletter titled Tariq al-Awda, or \\"The Path of Return,\\" which until 1964 was printed at al-Hawadeth Printing House. Prior to that, he helped establish the PLF's newspaper Abtal al-Awda (\\"Heroes of the Return\\") in 1960. Membership in the PLF increased steadily and according to al-Hout, by 1964 it included \\"newcomers from the refugee camps in Lebanon, Kuwait, Syria, Jordan, Amman, the West Bank, as well as people belonging to the different Palestinian classes, ranging from simple workers to teachers and engineers.\\" Their stated aim was to struggle for the liberation of Palestine\\" and emphasize the Arab character of that cause. Al- Hout later served as Deputy Secretary-General of the Arab Journalists Union in 1963 and held this post until 1967. He formed an alliance with Ahmed Shukeiri, the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and attended the first conference by the Palestinian National Council (PNC) in Jerusalem in May 1964, becoming an original founder. He resigned from his post at al-Hawadeth to focus on his new post within the PLO. Al-Hout was appointed representative and head of the organization's office in Lebanon in 1965, then joined the PLO's Executive Committee, during its first meeting in July 1966. Al-Hout encouraged the formation of sports clubs and scout troops in the refugee camps in Lebanon, partly as a means to recruit more refugees into the PLF, and tried to extend these program into the camps of Syria under the guise of the Palestinian Popular Organization. In spring 1966, he allied the PLF with the Palestinian National Liberation Front, a Nasserist faction. Because of internal and external struggles in the PLO, he abdicated his position in the PLO-EC and his post as head of the PLF in the summer of 1968, leaving the latter group leaderless. That same year al-Hout became a founding member of the Union of Palestinian Writers. A number of other posts were also held by him, including membership in the Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists from 1964 to 1976. In retaliation for publishing editorials critical of Syrian policy, gunmen from the pro-Syrian faction as- Sa'iqa attacked the Beirut offices of PLO newspapers. They killed two journalists, but failed in assassinating al-Hout who wrote satirical columns for the daily al-Moharrer (\\"the Editor\\") at the time. From 1974, al-Hout represented the PLO at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). During the Lebanese Civil War, beginning in 1976, the 1982 Lebanon War, and the Sabra and Shatila massacre, al-Hout survived ten Israeli assassination attempts. He remained in Lebanon when Arafat and most of the PLO leadership were exiled from the country. As the PLO's representative to Lebanon, following the defeat of the organization to Israeli forces in 1982, al-Hout was responsible for handing over its remaining weapons to the Lebanese Army after most of its heavy weaponry was donated to their ally, the Lebanese National Movement (LNM). On 19 December 1984, he stated \\"The establishment of a Palestinian state over part of the Palestinian soil does not amount to the renunciation of the strategic aim. It is a pity that Israel realizes that... and knows that the establishment of such a state constitutes the reassertion of Palestinian national identity and the beginning of the end for Israel.\\" =Oslo and later life= In 1991, Arafat‚Äîwanting his admired, but loud-spoken, friend inside the leading circle‚Äîreappointed al-Hout to the PLO-EC. He then became a founding member of the Arab National Conference in 1992. In response to the 1993 Oslo Accords signed by Yasser Arafat, al-Hout resigned from his post in August 1993 in the PLO-EC along with Palestinian cultural chief Mahmoud Darwish and discontinued to represent the PLO at the UNGA. Al-Hout strongly advocated that all of historical Palestine belonged to the Palestinians, in one state, rejecting the two-state solution agreed on in the accords. Nonetheless, al-Hout remained a member of the PNC until his death, but retired from politics. Instead, he began writing his memoirs and continued writing about Arab nationalism. He was one of nine PLO-EC members, who signed a statement rejecting the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip‚Äîwhich would give the Palestinians limited self-rule over Gaza and Jericho‚Äîon 4 October 1995. Al-Hout stated he and many Palestinian refugees were worried that \\"Gaza and Jericho first\\" might be \\"Gaza and Jericho last.\\" He remained critical of the PLO leadership's stance and helped in the coordination of the Damascus-based Palestinian groups. Since 1996 he had been a member of the National Islamic Conference and became a founder of Mu'tamar al-Awda (\\"the Return Conference\\") since 2002. According to The Guardian, al- Hout viewed recent Palestinian developments with \\"dejection and pessimism, though never despair.\\" Death Al-Hout died at the age of 77 on 2 August 2009. The cause of his death was not clear, but an official at the Palestinian National Authority said he died of cancer. He is survived by his son Hader, his two daughters Hanine and Syrine, and wife Bayan Nuwayhed.Shafik Hout, former PLO spokesman who opposed 1993 peace accords with Israel, dies at 77 Associated Press. 4 August 2009. After a funeral service at al-Imam Ali mosque in Tariq al-Jdeideh, Lebanon, al-Hout's body was carried to the Martyrs of the Palestinian Revolution cemetery in the Shatila refugee camp. Attendees at the funeral procession included Lebanon's former Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, Lebanese MPs Alaaeddine Terro, Walid Jumblatt, Imad al-Hout. Also attending was the representative of Mahmoud Abbas in Lebanon, Asaad Abdel Rahman, former deputy speaker Elie al-Firzili, the head of the Journalists' Union Melhim Karam, an Amal delegation headed by the president of Amal's political bureau Jamil Hayek, and a Hamas representative in Lebanon, Ali Baraka.

The school, which housed all grades in a single building, was located near the center of the city and operated by the Silver Grove Independent Schools district. The school sports teams had the unusual nickname of Big Trains (boys) and Lady Trains (girls), derived from the fact that the city and school were established in 1911 when the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad built a railyard in the community. By the 2018‚Äì19 school year, the Silver Grove district, one of the state's smallest, was plagued by both low enrollment and low test scores. Recent graduating classes had been in single digits, and even after a significant increase in enrollment in that school year, the district had only slightly more than 200 students. The district's average ACT score for its juniors (11th grade) in the 2017‚Äì18 school year was 14.8 on the test's 36-point scale, with only one other high school in the state scoring lower. However, only seven students took the test in that year. At a February 2019 meeting of the Silver Grove school board at which a merger with the surrounding Campbell County Schools district was discussed, one parent noted that 87% of Silver Grove students were in households that met U.S. federal poverty guidelines. During this meeting, one board member suggested that the Silver Grove district close its high school component but continue to operate a K‚Äì8 school. Later that month, the Silver Grove board voted to fully merge with the Campbell County district, which serves most of the county, despite resistance from many students, parents, and teachers. Within a week, the Campbell County district's board voted to approve the merger, and the Silver Grove School held its final day of instruction on May 16, 2019, with the merger of the two districts officially taking effect on July 1.

This rare and complex character graphically places the 36-stroke tai ‰®∫ (with tripled Èõ≤ \\"cloud\\"), meaning \\"cloudy\\", above the 48-stroke t≈ç Èæò (tripled Èæç \\"dragon\\") \\"appearance of a dragon in flight\\". The second most complicated CJK character is the 58-stroke Chinese bi√°ng (∞ªû/link=wikt:‚ø∫Ëæ∂‚ø≥Á©¥‚ø≤Êúà‚ø±‚ø≤Âπ∫Ë®ÄÂπ∫‚ø≤Èï∑È¶¨Èï∑ÂàÇÂøÉ), which was invented for Biangbiang noodles \\"a Shaanxi-style Chinese noodle\\". Composition The Chinese character components for taito are both compound ideographs created by reduplicating a common character, namely the 12-stroke Japanese kumo or Chinese y√∫n Èõ≤ \\"cloud\\" (with the \\"rain radical\\" Èõ® and un or y√∫n ‰∫ë phonetic), and the 16-stroke \\"dragon radical\\" Japanese ry≈´ or Chinese l√≥ng Èæç. The Èõ≤ \\"cloud\\" character is tripled into 36-stroke tai or du√¨ ‰®∫ \\"cloudy\\" and quadrupled into 48-stroke d≈ç or n√≥ng ©áî \\"widely cloudy\\"; the Èæç \\"dragon\\" character is interchangeably doubled or tripled into 32- or 48-stroke t≈ç or d√° Èæñ or Èæò \\"appearance of a dragon in flight\\" and quadrupled into 64-stroke t≈ç or zh√© ™ö• \\"chatter; be garrulous\\". The taito, daito, or otodo character has two graphic variants (see images), the principal difference being the placement of the first dragon character. In version 1 (read either daito or otodo), the first dragon is written between the second and third cloud characters, starting at the 25th stroke. In version 2 (read taito), the first dragon is written after the third cloud character, starting at the 37th stroke. These triple dragon Èæò and triple cloud ‰®∫ logographs typify a type of CJK character formation. Several scholars have explained Chinese writing with a chemical bond analogy of Chinese character radicals as \\"atoms\\" that join together to form characters as \\"molecules\\". Some illustrations of \\"atomic structures\\" in Chinese characters are *n«ö Â•≥ \\"woman\\", nu√°n Â•ª \\"quarrel\\" , jiƒÅo „ö£ (=Âß£) \\"beautiful\\", and jiƒÅn Âß¶ \\"adultery; illicit sexual relations\\" *m√π Êú® \\"tree\\", l√≠n Êûó \\"woods; grove\\", and sƒìn Ê£Æ \\"forest\\" *ƒõr ËÄ≥ \\"ear\\", di√© ËÅë \\"settle a price\\", and ni√® ËÅ∂ (=ÂõÅ) \\"mumble; whisper\\" (or Ni√® ËÅ∂, a surname) *ti√°n Áî∞ \\"field\\", jiƒÅng Áïï (=Áï∫) \\"dykes between fields\\", and l√©i Áïæ \\"spaces between fields\\" The British historian of Chinese science Joseph Needham (1954: 31) explained, \\"To the natural scientist approaching the study of Chinese, a helpful analogy is possible with chemical molecules and atoms‚Äîthe characters may be considered roughly as so many molecules composed of the various permutations and combinations of a set of 214 atoms\\" (i.e., the 214 Kangxi radicals). The Israeli lexicographer Jack Halpern (1981: 73) similarly said, \\"The essence of the scheme is that the formation of Chinese characters can be likened to the way atoms combine to form the more complex molecules of compounds.\\" The American linguist Michael Carr (1986: 79) examined the best-case example of semantic \\"crystal characters\\" invented by repeating a radical, much like atoms forming crystal patterns‚Äîin the sense of r√¨ Êó• the \\"sun radical\\" in chƒÅng Êòå \\"sunlight; prosperous\\", xuƒÅn Êòç \\"bright\\", and jƒ´ng Êô∂ \\"bright; crystal\\". Carr (1986: 82-3) further distinguished \\"natural\\" crystal characters that occur in standard, written Chinese (citing the above example of d√° Èæñ \\"appearance of a dragon in flight\\" from the Èæç \\"dragon radical\\") versus \\"synthetic\\" or \\"artificial\\" ones that are restricted to Chinese dictionaries (d√° Èæò \\"appearance of a dragon in flight\\" and zh√© ™ö• \\"chatter\\"), which \\"are graphic ghosts from previous dictionaries, and unattested in actual usage.\\" Usage Daito on a shop in Tsukuba Some specialized Japanese dictionaries include the taito, daito, or otodo characters. Ono and Fujita's (1977) dictionary of Japanese names with difficult readings enters variant 1 pronounced daito or otodo. ≈åsuga's (1964) surname dictionary and Sugaware and Hida's (1990) kokuji dictionary include graphic variant 2 pronounced taito. This 84-stroke dictionary ghost word became a real Japanese name in 2000 when a ramen shop near the Kita-Matsudo Station in Chiba Prefecture was named using character variant 1 pronounced Otodo (Sasahara 2001). Chinese dictionaries Unabridged dictionaries of Chinese characters do not include either Japanese 84-stroke taito variant. Both Morohashi Tetsuji's Chinese-Japanese Dai Kan-Wa jiten, which has 49,964 head entries for characters, and the Chinese Hanyu Da Zidian (1989), which has 54,678, list the three most graphically complex characters as the 52-stroke Japanese h≈ç or b≈ç and Chinese b√®ng ‰®ª \\"sound of thunder\\" (with quadruple Èõ∑ \\"thunder\\"; 1960: 12693, 1989 6: 4085), 64-stroke tetsu or techi and zh√© ™ö• \\"chatter; be garrulous\\" (with quadruple Èæç \\"dragon\\"; 13747, 7: 4806), and 64-stroke sei and zh√©ng †îª \\"meaning unknown\\" (with quadruple Ëàà \\"rise\\"; 9816, 1: 254)‚Äîthe first occurrence of the ghost word †îª was in Sima Guang's (1066) Leipian dictionary, which gives the pronunciation gloss zh√®ng Êîø but no semantic gloss. Encoding This character was added to Unicode version 13.0 in March 2020. The character is located at U+3106C (±Å¨) in the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension G block in the newly-allocated Tertiary Ideographic Plane. Some extensive encoding systems for Japanese kanji do include taito variant character 2. The superseded Mojikyo font, which comprised 142,228 rare and obsolete characters, included it as number [066147]. The deprecated BTRON Business computer architecture TRON project (TRON stands for \\"The Real-time Operating system Nucleus\\") also included taito [3-7D6B], and it was included in the font under development by the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies's Jitƒ´ shotai GTÊõ∏‰Ωì project. In December 2015 it was included in document IRGN2107 as one of 1,640 characters submitted to the Ideographic Rapporteur Group for encoding (character source reference UTC-02960). The character was provisionally included in \\"IRG Working Set 2015\\", which are candidates for inclusion in a future CJK Unified Ideographs extension.

He was well known as a New York Society leader and was referred to as the \\"American Prince of Wales.\\" Early life Van Alen was the son of James Henry Van Alen (1819‚Äì1886), who served as a brigadier general in the Union Army during the Civil War, and Mary Young Steward (1818‚Äì1852). He attended and graduated from Oxford University. Career Van Alen donated $50,000 to Grover Cleveland's successful campaign for President. He was rewarded with an appointment as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Italy on October 20, 1893, but declined the appointment, owing to public disapproval. He was also rumored to have been appointed the United States Ambassador to Great Britain under President Cleveland. His father became wealthy from real estate, which he inherited upon his death in 1886. In 1919, he sold his house at 15 East 65th Street in Manhattan, to Rufus L. Patterson, due to his opposition to Prohibition. He then lived abroad, spending most of his time at a villa in Cannes, France, from February 1920 until his death. In 1919, Van Alen stated: > I know of lots of people that will leave the United States and make their > home in countries where the laws are not so strict.\\" In 1921, Van Alen sold eight three-story Harlem Houses in the 130th Street block, 28 to 42 West 130th Street, each on a lot 25 by 100 feet, between Fifth and Lenox Avenues to James H.

After his property and stock was given to his son, and taxes were paid, the residual estate was valued at $2,061,617 (). His will provided trust funds of $500,000 () each for his daughters, Mary and Sarah, the principal to go to their descendants. His son, James, received all real estate, property, and life estate in the residue and his grandson, James H. Van Alen, a surviving life estate.

Biography Pavel Derevyanko was born in the city of Taganrog, Rostov Oblast, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. His parents, Yuri Pavlovich and Tatiana Vasilievna Derevyanko, worked all their life at a factory in Taganrog. He studied in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR. Afterwards, Pavel moved to Moscow where he entered the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts. He studied there from 1996 until 2000. He was noticed by director Alexander Kott as a sophomore of the GITIS (course of Leonid Kheyfets) when Pavel with other students staged the performance Overstocked Packaging Barrels. When Alexander Kott began shooting his film Two Chauffeurs were Driving, he tracked down Derevyanko. At that time Pavel was rehearsing in Oleg Menshikov's theatrical project \\"Kitchen\\", but he did not wish to refuse the proposal of Alexander Kott to star in a film. The film Two Chauffeurs were Driving was warmly received by the audience, and the role of Kolka Snegirev brought the beginning actor his first fame. The young actor appeared then in the following films - Nine Lives of Nestor Makhno (2006), Antikiller 2 and the TV series Strafbat. Derevyanko is also well-known for acting in the comedies Hitler goes Kaput! (2008) and Rzhevsky versus Napoleon (2012). In 2013, the actor was nominated for the Golden Eagle Award for Best Actor in Television for the role of Mikhail Solovyov in the television series The Dark Side of the Moon. In the spring of 2015, he acted in the music video of Vasil Oblomov for the song \\"Mnogochodovochka\\". In the fall of 2015, a clip of the group Uma2rman \\"Toxins\\" with Pavel was released. He starred in a lead role (Peter III) in the TV series Catherine the Great (2015), along with Yuliya Snigir (Catherine II).

Nikephoros' accession in 802 resulted in a resumption of warfare between Byzantium and the Abbasid Caliphate. In late summer 804, the Abbasids had invaded Byzantine Asia Minor for one of their customary raids, and Nikephoros set out to meet them. He was surprised, however, at Krasos and heavily defeated, barely escaping with his own life. A truce and prisoner exchange were afterwards arranged. Despite his defeat, and a massive Abbasid invasion the next year, Nikephoros persevered until troubles in the eastern provinces of the Caliphate forced the Abbasids to conclude a peace. Background The deposition of Empress Irene of Athens (r. 797‚Äì802) in October 802, and subsequent accession of Nikephoros I, signalled a more violent phase in the long history of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine Wars. Following a series of destructive annual raids across Asia Minor by the Caliphate, Irene seems to have secured a truce with Harun al-Rashid in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of tribute, repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce following Harun's first large-scale campaign in 782... Nikephoros, on the other hand, was more warlike and determined to refill the imperial treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute.. Harun retaliated at once, launching a raid under his son al-Qasim. Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced an ultimately unsuccessful revolt of the Asian army under its commander-in-chief, Bardanes Tourkos. After disposing of Bardanes, Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out himself to meet a second, larger invasion under the Caliph himself. After Harun raided the frontier region, the two armies confronted each other for two months in central Asia Minor, but it did not come to a battle; Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters, until the Emperor arranged for a withdrawal and a truce for the remainder of the year in exchange for a one-off payment of tribute.. Battle In August 804, Harun dispatched another raid under his general Ibrahim ibn Jibril. The Arabs crossed into Asia Minor through the Cilician Gates and raided freely. Nikephoros set out to meet them, but was forced to return before he could do so due to some unspecified event at his back (Warren Treadgold surmises news of a possible conspiracy). On his march home, however, the Arabs launched a surprise attack at Krasos in Phrygia and defeated his army. The exact location of Krasos is unknown, but it was said to be a small plain along a road. According to al-Tabari, the Byzantines lost 40,700 men and 4,000 pack animals, while the Emperor himself was wounded three times. The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor confirms that the imperial army lost many men and that Nikephoros was almost killed himself; saved only by the bravery of his officers.; .. Aftermath Preoccupied with trouble in Khurasan, Harun now accepted tribute and made peace. An exchange of prisoners was also arranged and took place during the winter at the two empires' border, on the Lamos River in Cilicia; some 3,700 Muslims were exchanged for the Byzantines taken captive in the previous years. During Harun's absence in Khurasan, however, Nikephoros used the opportunity to rebuild the destroyed walls of the towns of Safsaf, Thebasa, and Ancyra. The following summer he launched the first Byzantine raid for two decades; into the Arab frontier district (thughur) in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided and took prisoners as it went, even capturing the major Abbasid stronghold of Tarsus. At the same time, another Byzantine force raided the Upper Mesopotamian thughur and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of Melitene, while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in Cyprus.; . Harun retaliated with a massive invasion in 806, which forced Nikephoros to come to terms,. but the Byzantine ruler soon violated them and prevailed over the Abbasid expeditions sent against him in 807.. Following renewed trouble in Khurasan, a peace treaty was signed in 808 which left the Byzantine frontier zone intact and ended the payment of tribute to the Caliphate..

It is a contributing property to the Schenley Farms National Historic District and the City of Pittsburgh Oakland Civic Center Historic District. The building was acquired by the university in mid-December, 2009. and has since been renovated to house academic and student activity programs. History The staircase on the renovated first floor On January 21, 1874, a group of prominent German Jews, mostly members of the Rodef Shalom Congregation, met for the purpose of organizing a private club in Pittsburgh, \\"to promote social and literary entertainment among its members.\\" The small group establishing the Jewish social club voted to host it at a private residence on Pittsburgh's North Side and voted Judge Josiah Cohen to be its first president. The popularity of the Club called for a move to larger quarters on Stockton Street on the North Side. It was at this location that a conference of eighteen rabbis met at the Club in November 1885 to sign the defining document of American Reform Judaism termed the Pittsburgh Platform. The creation of this document is commemorated by a historical marker placed by the state of Pennsylvania near the location of the Club at the time. The Club's growing acceptance encouraged a second move to the present quarters in Oakland, designed by a leading Pittsburgh architect, Charles Bickel. Characterized by the press as \\"a handsome facility,\\" the new quarters opened formally on December 25, 1913. The membership rolls of the club over the years included Pittsburgh Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss, industrialist Leon Falk Jr., and department store magnate Edgar J. Kaufmann. Eventually, the club began including eastern European Jews, and in more recent years membership was open without regard to gender, race, ethnicity or religion. When Concordia moved into its building on O'Hara Street in 1913, it was described as one of city's most opulent with notably elegant china, crystal and linens along with profuse flower arrangements. A 1915 article in the Jewish Criterion commented that the new club was \\"entirely complete with billiard rooms, banquet hall, rest and lounging parlors, reading quarters and sleeping accommodations.\\" Later the club would add to its interior by installing elaborate dark-stained oak paneling rescued from the lower level and bar of the 1905 constructed Fort Pitt Hotel at 10th Street and Penn Avenue, Downtown when it was demolished in 1967. At its peak the club had nearly 300 members, but in the face of declining membership and a shortage of cash, club members voted July 16, 2009 to approve the sale of their historic building to the University of Pittsburgh who will pay $2.1 million for the structure. The club continued its normal activities until the sale closed on December 14, 2009. Restoration and use Oak paneled studying and meeting space The University of Pittsburgh undertook $5.8 million in upgrades, preservation, and renovations that were completed in April, 2011 and provided almost of space in order to help alleviate shortages in student group event, meeting, and office space at the William Pitt Union. Upgrades included tearing out walls, updating the heating and cooling systems, replacing the roof, and upgrading the lighting. The first floor contains the oak paneled space for studying or socializing as well as a dining room that can double as a meeting room. A staircase, with original wood railings, leads to a second floor contains a 450-person capacity, sound system-equipped ball room that includes an open balcony, arched windows, and a small stage. From a previous renovation more than 50 years ago, the ballroom contains three chandeliers, one larger than the others, and a number of sconces. Renovations to the ball room included restoring access to the balcony, applying gold leaf trim to the wall panels, and a restoration of the chandeliers, including replacement of the light bulbs with LEDs, by the original lighting fabricator located in Pittsburgh's Strip District. The basement of the Student Center is used as a storage area for student groups. The facility also houses the Math Assistance Center, the Freshman Studies Program, and the student Writing Center.

All but one of the brick buildings were demolished around 2000 to make way for a storage locker facility. The bricks and tiles were saved for use in any future restoration of the spared building at 1100 Easton Avenue in Somerset, NJ, and the Marconi facility in Belmar, New Jersey. The station used a huge antenna supported by eight steel masts. In June 1918 an Alexanderson alternator was installed, the invention of the General Electric engineer, with an output power of 200 kilowatts and looking like an ordinary power station generator. Its frequency was around 17 kHz, which made its wavelength around 17,500 meters.

History In 1960, a practicing surgeon put up a small medical clinic at Daet, Camarines Norte. Initially the clinic attended to varied cases. Barely two years, after its establishment, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital expanded to 25 bed capacity. In 1965, it further expanded its bed capacity to 40 and in 1977 into a 100 bed capacity hospital. Dr. Abundio Palencia, saw the need of opening a school Midwifery which he envisioned would help produce the manpower resources urgently needed by various health agencies. Nineteen seventy seven (1977) saw the birth of the Our Lady of Lourdes College Foundation School of Midwifery with an initial enrolment of eighty (80) and a faculty force of ten (10). The school of midwifery made a name for the school by producing board topnotchers through the years: 69% School Passing Average (S.P.A) in 1988; 79.7% S.P.A., 62% National Passing Average (N.P.A), in 1992; 88% S.P.A in 1993. Our Lady of Lourdes Foundation embarked on the offering of other para-medical courses in 1989, namely: Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and Certificate in Health-Aide. The year 1989 was a milestone in the life of OLLCF. The three- storey concrete school building was put up on a four-hectare lot at Vinzons Avenue 600 meters away from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, the original school site. By 1991 the whole school transferred to the new site. Now with more than enough classrooms and campus space, Administration was further challenged to open more courses. Nineteen ninety two marked the opening of more courses namely: B.S. Medical Technology, B.S. Physical Therapy (5 years), B.S. Radiologic Technology, Associate in Radiologic Technology, B.S. Computer Science, B.S. Commerce, B.S. Secondary Education, B.S. Elementary Education, B.S. Tourism, B.S. Secretarial Administration, Associate in Computer Science, Computer Secretarial and in 1993, the High School Department was born with General Science and Computer Oriented Classes (I-IV). In June 1993, the first batch of Nursing Graduates passed the National Board Exam with a School passing average of 73% (the national passing averaged is 63%) and in December 1993, the second batch of graduates made it again with a school passing average of 89.9% while the national passing average was 64%. In 1994, the College of Midwifery made it again to the 13th Board Topnotcher, with S.P.A. of 72% while the N.P.A. is 53%. The passing average of the School of Midwifery in the 1995 Board Examination, first batch was 93%. The school produced a second Placer. The College of Nursing produced a thirteenth placer in the June 1995 Board Examination. In 1995, Bachelor of Science in Criminology was offered to provide opportunities to the youth of Camarines Norte who are aspiring to be a part of the country‚Äôs peacemaking process. Two years after, the construction of a new building to accommodate both the pre- school and elementary departments was started. When the construction was finally completed in 1998, the institution pioneered the opening of a pre- school Montessori department. The department offers socialized tuition fees to accommodate those who want to avail of quality Montessori education but cannot afford its cost. The first batch of criminology graduates took the board exams in August 1999 and ranked First Place throughout the Bicol Region in the 15-25 Examinees category. School year 1999-2000 marked the opening of the Elementary Department. A graduate school in consortium with the Philippines Women‚Äôs University was also opened. The department offered one Doctoral and four master's degrees. The construction of the first ever private Gymnasium was started in 2002. After its completion, it not only catered to the needs of the institution but was opened for public use as well. In 2004, Our Lady of Lourdes College Foundation was able to forge stronger ties with the University of the Philippines by becoming the testing center for the graduate and certificate programs of the University of the Philippines Open University. In the same year, CHED granted the institution the permit to operate Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation and Bachelor of Science on Marine Engineering Programs. To attain international recognition especially by the International Maritime Organization, OLLCF applied for and was granted ISO 9001:2000 certification on January 2005. In line with its physical plant development program, the institution continued to expand its land area which has reached 12 hectares in 2006. This provided for ample space where the basic Education building was constructed and where the academic square is being developed.

Biography =Early life= Kazakevich was born at Kremenchuk in Ukraine (then part of Imperial Russia) in 1913 and received training as an engineer at Kharkiv. In the early 1930s he moved to the Jewish autonomous region of Birobidzhan on the Amur River, where he became the chairman of a local kolkhoz and also ran a theatre. During these years he began writing and publishing poems and stories in Yiddish. In 1941 he was in Moscow, taking part in the defence efforts of the capital and later joining the regular Red Army for frontier service. His war service brought him close to some of the major battles of 1943-45 and finally into the battle for Berlin; by this time he had become assistant director of intelligence in one of the armies involved. =Career= After 1945 Kazakevich began writing in Russian, and his debut novel Zvezda (The star, 1947, adapted into a film in 1949 (remake - film 2002)) was an instant success. The novel describes an army intelligence unit during WW2 and their raid behind enemy lines. The book showcases some of his later recurrent traits: the sharp, lyrical evocation of nature, the interest in moral conflicts and ambiguities, often relating to the transition between war and peace, the sense of humour and psychological observation. Many of his later stories are set during or shortly after the Second World War. The novella \\"In the Light of Day\\" (1960) explores ambiguities of guilt, bravery and memory as a soldier makes a visit to the widow of his fallen friend and unit officer. During the fifties, Kazakevich reached high positions in the Soviet Association of Writers and was aligned with the efforts of de-Stalinization. He kept picking up potentially sensitive subjects, and during his last years may have been working on a major novel about Lenin during the revolutionary years. The short novel Sinyaya tetrad (The Blue notebook) appeared in 1961; it is set during Lenin's stay on the Karelian isthmus in the summer of 1917 and brings Lenin face to face both with ordinary people and with Grigory Zinovyev, who was still considered a traitor or at best a dubious figure at the time of writing. While Kazakevich, in the end, makes Lenin refute Zinovyev's fears and allegations, there is no attempt to show the latter as an evil or insincere person, which would have been a given for most Soviet writers at the time. Kazakevich continued with Lenin as a main character in another story, \\"Enemies\\", written in his last year, and it is likely that he was planning to bring them together within a larger novel about Lenin. However, his sudden passing away in the summer of 1962 meant that those plans were left unfulfilled.

He was one of the first makers of the Brescian school and a contemporary of Gasparo da Sal√≤. He was born in Montichiari, the son of Zanetto Micheli, and for 65 years he carried out a very long and rich career as a music instrument maker, specializing in strings, learned from Zanetto. He started with violas; then in the 1550s he worked with violins and in the 1570s also in ceteras. The first record of his activity is in 1548, when he was 28 years old. In 1568 he was called \\"maestro di strumenti da sonar\\" (master of instrument for playing) a special qualification in common with da Sal√≤ that testifies to the variety of the items made by the maker: viols, violas, violones, lyras, double basses, violins, ceteras. The last record is in 1606 where Pellegrino is mentioned like \\"citharedi\\". He became a very rich man like da Sal√≤ and Costanzo Antegnati. The name has been misunderstood as Pellegrino Zanetto or Zanetto Pellegrino for the fact that in his labels he named himself \\"Peregrino . q(uondam). m(agistro).

After a failed Byzantine attempt to recover the Emirate of Crete in the previous year, the Abbasids launched a raid into Asia Minor. The Byzantine regent, Theoktistos, headed the army that went to meet the invasion but was heavily defeated, and many of his officers defected to the Arabs. Internal unrest prevented the Abbasids from exploiting their victory, however. A truce and a prisoner exchange were consequently agreed in 845, followed by a six-year cessation of hostilities, as both powers focused their attention elsewhere. Background Following the restoration of the veneration of icons in March 843, the Byzantine Empire's government, headed by the Empress-regent Theodora and the logothetes Theoktistos, embarked on a sustained assault on the Byzantines' main political and ideological foe, the Abbasid Caliphate and its dependencies. This aggressive stance was on the one hand facilitated by the internal stability that the end of the Iconoclasm controversy brought, and on the other encouraged by a desire to vindicate the new policy through military victories against the Muslims... The first such campaign, an attempted reconquest of the Emirate of Crete led by Theoktistos in person, made initial gains, but ultimately ended in disaster. After scoring a victory over the Arabs in Crete, Theoktistos learned of a rumour that Theodora intended to name a new emperor, possibly her brother Bardas. Theoktistos hurried back to Constantinople, where he discovered that the rumour was false, but in his absence, the Byzantine army in Crete was routed by the Arabs... Battle In 844, according to Byzantine sources, Theoktistos learned of an Arab invasion of Byzantine Asia Minor, led by a certain 'Amr, probably the semi-autonomous emir of Malatya, Umar al-Aqta. The Arab sources do not make explicit mention of this campaign. The Russian scholar Alexander Vasiliev, however, identified it with an expedition recorded in the poems of Abu Tammam and Buhturi, which was led by general Abu Sa'id and took place during the regency of Theodora. Umar al-Aqta's participation is likely, as he often aided the Abbasids in their raids against the Byzantines.. According to Arab accounts, the troops led by Abu Sa'id comprised men from the border emirates of Qaliqala (Erzurum) and Tarsus. The Arab forces united at Ardandun (possibly the border fort of Rhodandos) before raiding through the Byzantine themes of Cappadocia, Anatolikon, Boukellarion, and Opsikion. Sa'id's troops sacked Dorylaion and even reached the shore of the Bosporus.. Theoktistos led the Byzantine army against the invaders, but was heavily defeated at Mauropotamos (\\"Black River\\"). The location of the latter, if indeed it is a river and not a simple toponym, is disputed; it was most likely a tributary of the Sangarius in Bithynia or of the Halys in Cappadocia. Not only did the Byzantines suffer heavy casualties, but many senior Byzantine officials defected to the Arabs... Theoktistos returned to Constantinople, where he blamed Bardas for the recent defeats and had him exiled from the capital... Aftermath The Abbasids were unable to exploit their success due to the internal instability of the Caliphate. Likewise, the Byzantines preferred to focus their strength against the ongoing conquest of Sicily by the Aghlabids. Thus, a Byzantine embassy was sent to Baghdad in 845, which was warmly received. The Abbasids reciprocated with an embassy to Constantinople, where the two states agreed on a truce and a prisoner exchange, which was held at the River Lamos on 16 September 845. A winter raid by the Arab governor of Tarsus shortly after failed disastrously, after which the Arab-Byzantine frontier remained quiet for six years.; .

Life and work Emilio Caraffa was born in Catamarca, Argentina, in 1862. His family relocated to Rosario, where he attended the local National College (a system of public college preparatory schools), and learned to draw and sketch. He received lessons in painting in Buenos Aires from 1883 to 1884, an experience which earned him a scholarship from the Minister of Justice and Culture, Eduardo Wilde. Caraffa attended art academies in Naples and Rome, as well as in Madrid's Royal Fine Arts Academy of San Fernando, where he studied under Francisco Pradilla and was inducted into the Order of Charles III, in 1887.Parker, William Belmont.

Returning to Argentina in 1890, Caraffa relocated to C√≥rdoba, where in 1896, he received authorization from the progressive Governor of C√≥rdoba Province, Jos√© Figueroa Alcorta, to establish the Provincial Fine Arts Academy.Secretar√≠a de Cultura de C√≥rdoba: Emilio Caraffa Caraffa was appointed a professor at the C√≥rdoba National University in 1900. Head of a Jewish Man, oil on canvas. His earlier works were largely landscape art, a popular genre locally, at the time; after 1900, however, his art tended towards post- impressionism - a largely overlooked genre among Argentine art patrons which Caraffa, who enjoyed strong official support, arguably helped popularize in Argentina. Among his best-known early works from this period in his career was Head of a Jewish Man, which he exhibited at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, earning a silver medal. Remaining active in the C√≥rdoba cultural sphere, he obtained funding for the province's first official art museum in 1911, and the institution opened in 1916.Museo Caraffa: colecci√≥n Untitled, oil on canvas. Caraffa was commissioned to lead the decoration of the ceilings of the C√≥rdoba Cathedral, a work completed in 1914. Over time, he developed a painting style of a markedly romanticist bent, and created numerous landscapes, portraits and works of historic and religious art for government bureaus and churches. The prolific painter died suddenly in his atelier in the scenic town of La Cumbre, in 1939. Eleven years after his death, the provincial museum he helped establish was renamed the Emilio Caraffa Provincial Fine Arts Museum. His works, besides those gracing private homes, churches and government offices, can be found in numerous Argentine museums, among them the Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum (Rosario) and the National Fine Arts Museum (Buenos Aires).

Acintya is equivalent to the metaphysical concept of Brahman of Indian Hinduism, and is the Supreme God in traditional wayang (shadow puppet) theatre. All gods, goddesses and existence are believed to be the manifestation of the Acintya in Balinese Hinduism. Role Empty throne to the Supreme God Acintya corresponds to a rather recent trend towards monism in Bali, according to which there is one supreme deity, and that all other gods are only manifestations of him. Acintya is emptiness, and considered as the origin of the Universe, all other divinities emanating from him. He is often associated to the sun god, and depicted in human form with flames around him. His nakedness expresses that \\"his consciousness is no longer carried away by his sense-faculties\\". Prayers and offerings are not made directly to Acintya, but also to the other manifestations of the deity. He is often not even represented, in which case he is only evoked by an empty throne on top of a pillar (the Padmasana, lit. \\"lotus throne\\"), inside Balinese temples. The introduction of the Padmasana as an altar to the Supreme God, was the result of a 16th-century Hindu reformation movement, led by Dang Hyang Nirartha, the priest of the Gelgel King Batu Renggong (also Waturenggong), at the time when Islam was spreading from the west through Java. Dang Hyang Nirartha built temples in Bali, and added the Padmasana shrines to the temples he visited. Political aspects Statuette of Acintya, Bali Museum Since the end of World War II and the Indonesian War of Independence, the Republic of Indonesia has adopted the political philosophy of Pancasila (literally, \\"The five principles\\"), which allows for freedom of religion. The statute, however, requires that the religion in question be monotheistic, i.e., based upon the belief in a single, omnipotent deity. Under this system, six religions are recognised: Islam, Buddhism, Catholicism, Protestantism, Hinduism and later on Confucianism. To comply with regulations, Balinese Hindus have felt the need to reinforce the monotheistic component of the faith, thus the more emphasised role of Acintya.McDaniel, June (2013), A Modern Hindu Monotheism: Indonesian Hindus as ‚ÄòPeople of the Book‚Äô. The Journal of Hindu Studies, Oxford University Press, To refer to him, they selected the term Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa (glossed as \\"God Almighty\\"), which although coined in the 1930s by Protestant missionaries to describe the Christian God, was thought to be well- adapted to describe the Hindu supreme deity. This is thus the name which is now more commonly used by modern Balinese.

The Beckler River originates near Jack Pass and flows southeast about where it is joined by the Rapid River, its principal tributary. The Beckler then flows generally south for about to empty into the South Fork Skykomish River. The upper portion of the Beckler River flows through a narrow, steep, and densely forested valley with slopes rising and higher over the valley floor. Over its lower course the river valley widens slightly. In its last half-mile the valley opens out into the South Fork Skykomish valley. The only community in the region is Skykomish. Nearly all the Beckler River's tributaries, with the notable exception of Rapid River, exhibit steep mountain character with numerous cascades and rapids in narrow channels, boulders, and rocky bottoms. The Rapid River is similar in its upper portion, but moderates in its final . Much of the Rapid River's drainage basin has been logged. Much of the Beckler River's drainage basin is within the Wild Sky Wilderness, although the main river itself is not. The Rapid River's basin is within the Wild Sky Wilderness and the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness. Parts of the main Rapid River itself are in both wildernesses. Both wildernesses are part of Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Forest Service Road 65, the Beckler River Road, runs north from U.S. Route 2 following the river to Jack Pass and connecting to Forest Service Road 63, the North Fork Skykomish Road. Course The Beckler River originates south of Jack Pass, west of Frog Mountain and east of Bear Mountain, in the central North Cascades. It flows generally south, picking up the tributary Evergreen Creek from the east and passing San Juan Hill on the west. Boulder Creek, flowing from Boulder Lake, joins from the west. Bullbucker Creek joins from the east. A longer tributary, Fourth of July Creek, joins from the west, having comes many miles from Fourth of July Lake near Townsend Mountain and Burley Mountain. Shortly downstream from the Fourth of July confluence the Beckler is joined from the east by its main tributary, the Rapid River. Below that the Beckler River is joined by Johnson Creek then Harlan Creek from the east. The river passes by Eagle Rock to the west and Beckler Peak to the east. Eagle Creek joins from the west. Eagle Creek flows for many miles from its source near Eagle Lake, just upstream from Paradise Meadow. Eagle Lake and Paradise Meadow are separated by a fairly low but rough pass from Barclay Lake, a popular hiking destination near Mount Baring. Below Eagle Creek the Beckler River valley broadens. Beckler River Campground is on the banks of the lower river. Shortly below that the Beckler River empties into the South Fork Skykomish River near the town of Skykomish.General course info mainly from USGS topographic maps accessed via the \\"GNIS in Google Map\\" feature of the USGS Geographic Names Information System website. History The Beckler River is named for Elbridge H. Beckler, who was the chief engineer of the Pacific extension of the Great Northern Railway from 1889 to 1893. Nearby Beckler Peak is also named for him. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries USGS undertook a massive mapping project in the Cascade Mountains north of Snoqualmie Pass. The Beckler River area was surveyed for this project in 1902 by W.C. Guerin. Prospectors had already thoroughly explored the region by the 1890s. Mineral discoveries prompted booms in the late 19th century, especially at Monte Cristo. The main route to Monte Cristo, before alternate routes were found, was north from Index via the North Fork Skykomish River. The Beckler River offered another route, over Jack Pass to the North Fork Skykomish River. Prospectors explored the Beckler River region during the early 1890s. Natural history The Beckler River supports Chinook and coho salmon. Chinook spawning takes places mainly in the Beckler and lower Rapid River. Coho use shallower side channels of the Beckler River and a few small tributaries. Adult salmon benefit from a trap-and-haul operation that transports them over a barrier on the lower South Fork Skykomish River.

He was the head of the Iran section at the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office between 1998‚Äì2000.  Personal life and family  Michael Axworthy was born in Woking on 26 September 1962. He spent his childhood in West Kirby, Radyr, Ilkley and Chester, where he attended The King's School. Axworthy visited Iran frequently during holidays as a teenager because his father, Ifor, was involved in a project there with the Midland Bank. He recalled leaving the capital, Tehran, around September 1978 soon after the first large demonstrations against the soon-to-be-deposed Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, had taken place in the city. While studying history at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in the 1980s, Axworthy was greatly influenced by historians and other academics with interests in the history of ideas, such as Tim Blanning, Maurice Cowling, and Martin Golding. He graduated with a BA degree in 1985 and was awarded an MA in 2002. He lived with his wife, Sally (n√©e Hinds), whom he married in 1996, at Morwenstow, Cornwall. He died of cancer at his house in Rome on 16 March 2019 and was survived by his son and three daughters.  Career  An inability to get a grant to study for a Ph.D. led Axworthy to apply for work at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), a department of the UK government where he thought he would be able to indulge in his desire for a challenging job that involved living abroad. He stayed with the FCO until 2005, and was its Head of Iran Section in Tehran between 1998‚Äì2000 after spells working in Germany and Malta. Axworthy took leave from the FCO in 2000 and in 2005 he resigned his position. He later said: Axworthy became a Research Fellow at the Centre for Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, University of Durham, in December 2001. From 2005, he taught Middle East history at Exeter University. He was appointed director of the university's newly established Centre for Persian and Iranian Studies in 2008 and since 2012, when he was awarded a Ph.D., was a senior lecturer in the university's Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies. He acknowledged the irony that the bureaucracy he tried to escape by leaving the FCO had now resurfaced in his academic life. He was a critic of the target-led UK higher education system ‚Äì \\"Everybody is hyper-incentivised to pursue research grant applications and so on when everybody knows, including the Treasury and research councils, that presumably 90 per cent of that effort is completely wasted\\" ‚Äì but accepted that there is probably no perfect solution. Axworthy was refused entry to Iran in his later years, during the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He was uncertain of the reasons for this, having been variously told that it was because of general relationship issues involving Iran and the UK and that it was due to the content of his own writings. On one occasion, in 2008, he and his family were all refused a visa at a time when his wife was due to take up the post of deputy head of mission for the FCO in Tehran; on another, in 2012, he was eventually granted a visa but was turned back at the border.  Writings, broadcasts and consultancy  In 2006, Axworthy took part in The Doha Debates, successfully arguing against the motion that \\"This House believes that Iran poses the greatest threat to security in the region.\\" His first book, The Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from Tribal Warrior to Conquering Tyrant, was published in the same year and his second, Empire of the Mind: A History of Iran, was published in the following year. 2013 saw publication of Axworthy's book titled Revolutionary Iran: A History of the Islamic Republic, which was described by James Buchan as a \\"calm and literary portrait\\". A review by Ervand Abrahamian raised several criticisms, including Axworthy's subscription to what he, Abrahamian, believes to be a \\"royal myth\\", and that the book deals better with contemporary events than it does with history. Nonetheless, Abrahamian says \\"If you were to read only one book on present-day Iran you could not do better than this.\\" Axworthy wrote articles for academic journals and for publications such as The Guardian, Prospect and The Independent, and appeared on broadcast programmes such as Start the Week, Sky News, Today and A History of the World in 100 Objects, as well as on the Peterhouse team in the 2018 Christmas series of University Challenge. He was also an editor. Other work undertaken by Axworthy included consultancy for organisations such as Credit Suisse and Citibank. He also worked with the governments of the Netherlands, Norway, UK and United States, as well as NATO, for all of whom he gave briefings and other speaking engagements.  Recognition  Axworthy was a Fellow both of the Royal Asiatic Society (2007) and the Royal Society of Arts. He was elected to the governing council of the British Institute of Persian Studies in 2017.

Historical inscriptions of circa 200 BCE indicate the oldest known place in Satara district in Maharashtra is Karad (mentioned as Karhakada). It is also believed that the Pandavas stayed in Wai, then known as 'Viratnagari', in the 13th year of exile. The empire of Chandragupta II, known as Mahendraditya Kumargupta I, extended as far as Satara district in Deccan when he ruled between 451 and 455 CE. The Mauryan empire in the Deccan was followed by the rules of \\"Satvahans\\" for about two centuries between 550 and 750 CE. The first Muslim invasion of the Deccan took place in 1296. In 1636 the Nizam Shahi dynasty came to an end. In 1663 Shivaji conquered Parali and Satara fort. After the death of Shivaji, Aurangzeb conquered Satara fort later won by Parshuram Pratinidhi in 1706. In 1708 Shahu I was crowned within the Satara fort. The direct descendants of the great Maratha King Chh. Shivaji continue to live in Satara. The current king of Satara, Chh. Udayanraje Bhonsale is the 13th descendant of Shivaji. After their victory in the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1818, the British Empire annexed most of the Maratha territory to Bombay Presidency, but restored the titular Raja Pratap Singh, and assigned to him the principality of Satara, an area much larger than the present district. As a result of political intrigues, he was deposed in 1839, and his brother Shahji Raja was placed on the throne. When this prince died without a male heir in 1848, Satara was annexed by the British government and added to Bombay Presidency.  Muslim Rule  In 1429 Bahmani Sultanate's Malik-ut-Tujjar, the Subedar or governor of Daulatabad, with the hereditary officers or deshmukhs, went through the country restoring order. Their first operations were against some Ramoshis in Khatav Desh and a body of banditti that infested the Mahadev hills. The army next marched to Wai and reduced several forts. So entirely had the country fallen waste that the old villages had disappeared and fresh villages had to be formed, which generally included the lands of two or three old villages. Lands were given to all who would till them, free of rent for the first year and for a horse-bag of grain for the second year. This settlement was entrusted to Dadu Narsu Kale, an experienced Brahman, and to a Turkish eunuch of the Court [Grant Duff's Marathas, Vol. I p. 51.]. In 1453, Malik-ut-Tujjar, who was ordered to reduce the sea coast, of Konkan forts, fixed his headquarters at Chakan, a small fort eighteen miles north of Poona, and, after reducing several chiefs, laid siege to a fort whose chief was named Shirke who he speedily obliged to surrender, and to deliver himself and family into his hands. Malik-ut-Tujjar insisted that Shirke should embrace the Muhammedan faith or be put to death. Shirke on this, assuming an air of great humility, represented that there existed between him and Sharikar Ray of Khelna or Vishalgad in Kolhapur a family jealousy, and that should he become a Muhammedan, his rival, on Malik-ut-Tujjar's retreat, would taunt him with ignominy and excite his own family and subjects to revolt. He further promised to accept the Muhammedan faith if Malik-ut-Tujjar would reduce his rival, and agreed to guide him and his forces through the woody and very difficult country to Shahkar's dominions. Malik-ut-Tujjar marched against the chief of Khelna but was treacherously surrounded and killed in the woods by Shirke[Briggs' Ferislita, III. pp. 438‚Äì39.]. In 1481, on the death of Mahmud Gavan, his estate of Bijapur including Satara was conferred on Yusuf Adil Khan the future founder of the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur Yusuf Adil Shah of Bijapur was a Turk, a son of Amurath Sultan (1421‚Äì1451) of Constantinople. At the same time the Nizam Shahi dynasty under Ahmad Nizam was established at Ahmadnagar (1490‚Äì1636), the Kutb Shahi dynasty under Sultan Kutb-ul-mulk at Golkonda (1512‚Äì1609), and the Barid Shahi under Kasim Barid at Bedar (1492‚Äì1609). The principal Maratha Chiefs in Satara under the Bijapur government were Chandrarao More of Jaoli, about thirty-five miles northwest of Satara, Rav Naik Nimbalkar of Phaltan about thirty-five miles north-east of Satara. Junjharrav Ghatge of Malavadi about twenty-seven miles east of Satara, Daphale of Jath about ninety miles south-east of Satara, Mane of Mhaswad about sixty miles east of Satara, and the Ghorpade of Kapshi on the Varna about thirty miles south of Karad. A person named More, originally a Karnatak chief was appointed in the reign of Yusuf Adil Shah (1490‚Äì1510) to the command of a body of 12,000 Hindu infantry sent to reduce the strong tract between the Nira and the Varna. More was successful. He dispossessed the Shirkes and completely suppressed the depredations of their abettors, the chiefs of whom were Gujar, Mamulkar, Mohite, and Mahadik. More was dignified with the title of Chandrarav and his son Yeshvantrav, having distinguished himself in a battle fought with the troops of Burhan Nizam Shah (1508‚Äì1553), in which he captured a green flag, was confirmed in succession to his father as Raja of Javli and had permission to use the banner he had won. Rav Naik Nimbalkar or Phaltanrav was the Naik of Phaltan. His original surname was Pawar; he had taken the name of Nimbalkar from Nimbalik or Nimlak where the first Nimbalkar lived. The family is considered one of the most ancient in Maharashtra as the Nimbalkar was made sardeshmukh of Phaltan before the middle of the seventeenth century by one of the Bijapur kings. The deshmukh of Phaltan is said to have become a polygar or independent chief and to have repeatedly withheld the revenues of the district. Vangoji or Jagpalrav Naik Nimbalkar who lived in the early part of the seventeenth century was notorious for his restless and predatory habits. Dipabai the sister of Jagpalrav was married to Maloji Bhonsle, Shivajis grandfather who was one of the principal chiefs under the Ahmadnagar kingdom. Jagpalrav Naik seems to have been a man of great influence. It is said that it was through his exertions that the marriage of Maloji's son Shahaji and Jijabai, Lukhdev Jadhavrav's daughter, was brought about against the wishes of the girl's parents. One of the Phaltan Naiks was killed in 1620 in a battle between Malik Ambar and the Moghals. Nimbalkar never exchanged his ancient title of naik for that of Raja. Junjharrav Ghatge, the deshmukh of Malavadi was the head of a powerful family whose founder Kam Raje Ghatge had a small command under the Bahamani kings. His native country Khatav was separated from that of the Nimbalkar by the Mahadev Hills. The Ghatges were deshmukhs and sardeshmukhs of the pargana of Man. In 1626 Nagoji Ghatge was given the title of sardeshmukh as an unconditional favour by Ibrahim Adil Shah II, together with the title of Jhunjarrao. The head of the Mane family was deshmukh of Mhaswad, adjoining the district of the Ghatges. The Manes were distinguished shiledars or self-horsed cavaliers under Bijapur, but were nearly as notorious for their revengeful character as the Shirkes. The Ghorpades, who were originally Bhonsles, according to then-family legend acquired their present surname during the Bahamani times from having been the first to scale a fort Khelna or Vishalgad in 1471. See Sherwani II. K., Bahamanis of Deccan, p. 298.] in the Konkan which was deemed impregnable by fastening a cord round the body of a ghorpad or iguana. They were deshmukhs under the Bijapur government and were divided into two distinct families, one of Kapshi near the Varna river and the other of Mudhol near the Ghatprabha in the Karnatak. Under Bijapur the Kapshikar Ghorpades were known as the navkas or nine-touch Ghorpades and the Mudholkars as the satkas or seven-touch Ghorpades, a distinction which the two families maintain. The head of the Mudholkar Ghorpades was the patil of a village near Satara. The Ghorpades seem to have signalized themselves at a very early period. The high Musalman titles of Amir-ul-umra or Chief of the Nobles was conferred on one of the members of the Kapshi family by the Bijapur kings. The first Ghorpade that joined Shivaji was one of the Kapshikars while the Mudholkars were his bitter enemies. The Daphales were deshmukhs of the pargana of Jath. Their original name was Chavhan and they took the surname of Daphle from their village of Daphlapur of which they were hereditary patils. They held a command from the Bijapur kings [Grant Duff's Marathas, Vol. I, pp. 69‚Äì71.].  Shivaji Era - 1627-1680  In 1636 the Nizam Shahi dynasty came to an end. In 1637 Shahaji Bhonsle, the son of Maloji Bhonsle, who had taken a considerable part in Nizam Shahi affairs during the last years of the dynasty, nwas allowed to retire into the service of Mahmud Adil Shah of Bijapur (1636‚Äì1656). In 1637, besides giving Shahaji his jagir districts in Poona, Mahmud Adil Shah conferred on Shahaji a royal grant for the deshmukhi of twenty-two villages including Masur [Patrasar Sangraha No. 885.] in the district of Karad, the right to which had by some means devolved on government [Grant Duff's Marathas, Vol. I, p. 96.]. Before the middle of the 17th century, Shahaji's son Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha empire, had begun to establish himself in the hilly parts of Poona in the north where he had been put in possession of his father's estate of Poona and Supa. By 1648 he obtained control over the strong forts of Torna [According to jadunalli Sarkar the fort of Torna was captured in 1646 and Kajgad was a new fort built by Shivaji in the same year (Jadnnath Sarkar -Shivaji, p. 34). The date of acquisition of Koudana is not known. At this time the south of the Nira, as far east as Shirval and as far south as the range of hills north of the Krshna, was farmed by the hereditary deshmukh of Hirdas Maval, a Maratha named Bandal, and the fort of Rohida was committed, to his care, he early entertained a jealousy of Shivaji and kept a strong garrison and carefully watched the country round Purandhar. The deshpdnde of the place was a Prabhu. Wai was the station of a Bijapur Mukasadar or manager who had charge of Pandugad, Kamalgad and several other forts in the neighbourhood. Chandrarav More, Raja of Javli, was in possession of the Ghatmatha from the Krsna to the Varna [Grant Duffs Marathas, Vol. I, p. 109.]. The Bijapur government being impressed with the idea that Shivaji was incited by Shahaji, caused him to be imprisoned, and at the same time sent an army under Fateh Khan to attack Shivaji; but Shivaji proved more than a match for him and killed him in the battle of Belsar near Purandhar. Shahaji was subsequently released in the same year, and an effort was made to bring about reconciliation between him and Baji Ghorpade, the Mudhol Chief who had been instrumental in his capture. To induce both parties to forget what had passed, Mahmud Adil Shah made them exchange their hereditary rights and inams as deshmukhs. Baji Ghorpade thus obtained from Shahaji the deshmuki rights of twenty-two villages in Karad which Shahaji had acquired in 1637 from Bijapur [Grant Duffs Marathas, Vol. I, p. 115.]. This agreement however was not acted upon. Shivaji turned his attention to the Mores of Javli who were very powerful in that region. Afzal- Khan killed, 1659. Afzal Khan, an officer of high rank, volunteered to command the expedition, and in his public leave- taking, in the vaunting manner particularly common to Deccan Muhammedans of those days, pompously declared that he should bring back the insignificant rebel and cast him in chain under the footstool of the throne. To avoid impediments which presented themselves on the straight route from Bijapur and the heavy rains which seldom subsided in the neighbourhood of the hills till the end of October, the army proceeded in September 1659 from Bijapur to Pandharpur and thence marched towards Wai. Shivaji, on its approach, took up his residence in Pratapgad and sent the most humble messages to Afzal Khan. He pretended to have no thought of opposing so great a personage, and seemed only anxious to make his peace with the Bijapur government through the Khan's mediation; he affected the utmost sorrow for his conduct, which he could hardly persuade himself would be forgiven by the king, even if the Khan should receive him under the shadow of his protection; and he would surrender the whole of his country to the Khan were it possible to assure himself of his favour. Afzal Khan, who had all the vanity of a Muhammedan noble, had also a thorough contempt for his enemy. At the same time as he had formerly been in charge of the Wai district he was aware of the exceeding difficulty of an advance through the wild country which he must penetrate. With such considerations and mollified by Shivaji's submission, Afzal Khan in answer to repeated applications despatched a Brahman in his own service named Gopinathpant with suitable attendants to Pratapgad. On his arrival at Par, a village below the fort, Shivaji came down to meet him. The Brahman stated that the Khan, his master, and Shahaji were intimate friends, that the Khan bore no enmity towards his son, but on the contrary would prove his desire to aid him by interceding for his pardon, and even endeavouring to get him confirmed as jagirdar in part of the territory he had usurped. Shivaji acknowledged his obligation although his reply at the public meeting was not couched in the same humble strain he had used in his message. He said that if he could obtain a part of the country in jagir it would be all he could expect, that he was the king's servant and that he had been of considerable use to his government in reducing several chiefs whose territory would now come under the royal authority. This was the substance of what passed at their first interview. Shivaji provided accommodation for the envoy and his suite, but assigned a place for the Brahman at some distance from the rest. In the middle of the night Shivaji secretly introduced himself to Gopinathpant. He addressed him as a Brahman, his superior. He represented that all he had done was for the sake of Hindus and the Hindu faith, that he was called on by the Goddess Bhavani herself to protect Brahmans and cows, to punish the violators of their temples and their gods, and to resist the enemies of their religion, that it became Gopinathpaht as a Brahman to aid a course which Bhavani had sanctioned, and that if he did, he should ever after live among his caste and countrymen in comfort and wealth. Shivaji seconded his arguments with presents, and the solemn promise to bestow the village of Hivra on him and his posterity for ever. The Brahman envoy could not resist such an appeal seconded by such an inducement and swore fidelity to Shivaji, declared he was his for ever, and called on the goddess to punish him if he severed from any task Shivaji might impose. They consulted on the fittest means for averting the present danger. The Brahman, fully acquainted with Afzal Khan's character, suggested tempting him to a conference and Shivaji at once approved of the scheme. He sent for Krishnaji Bhaskar, a confidential Brahman, informed him of what had passed, and of the resolution which he had adopted. After fully consulting on the subject they separated as secretly as they had met. After holding some interviews and discussion for the purpose of masking their design, Krshnaji Bhaskar as Shivaji's agent was despatched with Gopinathpant to the camp of Afzal Khan. Gopinathpant represented Shivaji as in great alarm; but if his fears could be overcome by the personal assurance of the Khan, he was convinced that he might easily be prevailed on to give himself up. With a blind confidence Afzal Khan trusted himself to Gopinathpant's guidance. An interview was agreed on, and the Bijapur troops with great labour moved to Javli Shivaji prepared a place for the meeting below the fort of Pratapgad; he cut down the jungle, and cleared a road for the Khan's approach but every other avenue to the place was carefully closed. He ordered Moropant and Netaji Palkar from the Konkan with many thousands of the Mavli infantry. He communicated his whole plan to these two and to Tanaji Malusare. Netaji was stationed in the thickets a little to the east of the fort, where it was expected that part of the Khan's retinue would advance, and Moro Trimal with a body of old and tried men was sent to hide himself in the neighbourhood of the main body of the Bijapur troops which as had been agreed remained near Javli. The preconcerted signal for Netaji was the blast of a horn, and the distant attack by Moro Trimal was to begin on hearing the fire of five guns from Pratapgad which were also to announce Shivaji's safety. Fifteen hundred of Afzal Khan's troops accompanied him to within a few hundred yards of Pratapgad, where, at Gopinathpant's suggestion they were desired to halt to dispel any doubt and fear that Shivaji had professed about Khan's preparations. Afzal Khan, dressed in a thin muslin garment, armed apparently only with his sword, and attended, as per mutual agreement only by two armed soldiers, Bada Sayyad or Sayyad Banda and another, advanced in his palanquin to' a well-decorated reception tent set up for the occasion, about halfway up the ascent of the fort. Shivaji while preparing himself to meet the Khan for peaceful negotiations, had taken complete precautions to meet any contingency. It was Thursday, 10 November 1659. On that day after a morning bath and usual worship and prayers, Shivaji took his meals and bid a hasty but affectionate farewell to his friends, committing his son Sambhaji to their care. He rose, put on a steel chain cap under his turban and chain armour under his cotton gown, held Bhavani sword in his right hand, concealed a crooked dagger or bichva in his left sleeve, and put on a shield to cover his back. Thus armed he slowly descended from the fort. The Khan had arrived at the place of meeting before him, and expressed his jealous indignation at the lavish grandeur of decoration of the mandap which surpassed something that could be observed at Bijapur and which the son of a sardar of Bijapur should be in a position to display. By that time Shivaji was seen advancing, attended by two of his companions Jiva Mahala and Sambhaji Kavji. Shivaji viewing Afzal Khan at a distance expressed fear for the presence of Bada Sayyad and requested Khan, through Pantaji Gopinath that Bada Sayyad be kept a few paces away, to which Afzal Khan readily agreed and as if to dispel fear, even handed over his sword to Krshnaji Bhaskar who was standing nearby. Khan however, was not left completely unarmed; for he had a dagger fixed by his right side near the waist. With characteristic over-confidence Afzal Khan took no objection to Shivajis companions although they had possessed their usual arms with them, a circumstance which might have passed unnoticed, being common amongst Marathas. He advanced two or three paces to meet Shivaji; they were introduced to each other by Pantaji Gopinath and further in the midst of the customary embrace, the tall and mighty Khan was able to hold the neck of comparatively short statured Shivaji under his left arm. As the Khan tried to press it, he took out his dagger from his waist on the right side and tried to hit the left side of Shivaji. As Shivaji was clad in armour, the steel weapon only made a sharp rubbing sound against his side but did not hurt him. Thereupon Shivaji, ever on his guard hit the bichva in his left hand on the right side of the Khan. Unfortunately the Khan wore no armour and therefore the hit proved singularly effective and ripped open his bowels [The story told by Sabhasad and reproduced by Grant Duff, that Shivaji fixed Vaghnakhs or steel tiger's claw on his fingers and used the weapon for killing Afzal Khan, is not supported by Shiva Bharat, which is a contemporary and a comparatively more reliable evidence. That Vaghnakhi were found in the collection possessed by the later Chhatrapatis of Satara is however true. In 1827 Raja Pratapsinh then Chief of Satara (1810‚Äì1839) gave the Vaghnakhs to Mr. Elphinstone. They were most formidable steel hooks and attached to two rings fitting the fingers and lay concealed in the inside of the hand. Colbrooke's Elphinstone. II 188. See also Scott Waring's Marathas, 69,]. Khan uttered the words 'treachery' 'treachery' and shouted for help. Khan's hold on Shivajis neck by this time was naturally slackened and Shivaji having made himself free quickly thrust his sword right through Afzal Khan's stomach and in a moment Afzal Khan lay dead on the ground. Krishnaji Bhaskar who possessed Afzal Khan's sword tried to rescue him but was held at bay by Shivaji who with another stroke of his sword separated the head of the Khan from the trunk of his body. At this moment Sayyad Banda rushed forth and tried to attack Shivaji but Jiva Mahala finished him. The palanquin bearers of Khan tried to take away the body putting it in the palanquin but Sambhaji Kavji hit at their legs, seized the head of the Khan and marched towards the gate of the fort. The sharp shrill sound of the bugle- like horn was a signal to Netaji Palkar and the Mavalas lying in concealment, who fell upon Khan's army, that was resting at the foot of the hill. Moro Trimal also, began his operations on hearing the sound of five guns fired from Pratapgad on Shivaji coming out safe. Few of the Bijapur soldiers had time to mount their horses or stand to their arms. Netaji Palkar gave no quarter; but orders were sent to Moropant to' spare all who submitted. Shivajis humanity to his prisoners was conspicuous on this as on most occasions. Many of those that had attempted to escape were brought in several days afterwards in a state of great wretchedness. Their reception and treatment induced many of the Maratha prisoners to enter Shivaji's service. The most distinguished Maratha taken was Jhunjharrav Ghatge whose father had been the intimate friend of Shahaji, but Shivaji could not induce him to depart from his allegiance to Bijapur. At his own request he was allowed to return, and was honourably dismissed with valuable presents. The son and family of Afzal Khan were taken by one of Shivaji's officers, but on being offered a large bribe he agreed to guide them to a place of safety, and led them by unfrequented paths across the mountains and along the banks of the Koyna, until he safely lodged them in Karad. When this treachery came to Shivaji's knowledge he was condemned to death and at once executed. In 1662 when Shivaji thought of making Raigad in Kolaba his capital he held the Konkan Ghatmatha that is the hilly west Deccan from the Bhima to the Varna [Grant Duff's Marathas, 147.]. In 1665, in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Purandhar by which Shivaji ceded to the Moghals the forts which he had taken from them and twenty others taken or built by him in the old Nizam Shahi territory and obtained the right of levying the chauth and sardeshmukhi over the Bijapur dominions and to co-operate with the Moghals to subdue Bijapur, Shivaji with a body of 2,000 horse and 8,000 infantry joined Jaisingh and the combined army marched about November. Their first operations were against Bajaji Naik Nimbalkar a relation of Shivaji and jagirdar of Bijapur. Phaltan was reduced and the fort of Tathvad scaled by Shivaji's Mavlis. All the fortified places in their route were taken. Ali Adil Shah had prepared his troops, but endeavoured to prevent the invasion by promises of settling the demands of the Moghals. But Jaysingh continued his advance and met with little opposition until near Mangalvedha in Sholapur [Grant Duff's Marathas, 165.] In 1668 Shivaji obtained a yearly payment of money from the Bijapur Government in lieu of a levy of the Chauth and Sardeshmukhi over the Bijapur dominions and in spite of the narrowing of his territory by the Purandhar treaty he still retained the western Satara hills. = Shivaji's institutions = The years 1668 and 1669 were of greatest leisure in Shivaji's life. Some of his contemporaries, speculating on the future, supposed from his apparent inactivity that he would sink into insignificance, but he employed this interval in revising and completing the internal management of his government, which with his various institutions are the key to the forms of government afterwards adopted by every Maratha state. Shivaji's regulations were gradually formed and enlarged, but after a certain period underwent no change by the extension of his territory until he assumed the ensign of royalty. Even then the alterations were rather in matters of form than in rules. The plans of Maratha expansion which were afterwards pursued so successfully by his nation may be traced from a very early period and nothing is more remarkable in regard to Shivaji than the foresight with which some of his schemes were laid and the fitness of his arrangements for the genius of his countrymen. The foundation of his power was his infantry; his occupation of the forts gave him a hold on the country and a place of deposit for his plunder. His cavalry had not yet spread the terror of the Maratha name; but the rules of formation and discipline for his troops, the interior economy of his infantry and cavalry, the regulations for his forts, his revenue and judicial arrangements, and the chief offices through which his government was administered were fully developed. Shivaji's Infantry was raised in the West Deccan and Konkan; the men of the West Deccan tract were called Malis or westerners, those of the Konkan, Hetkaris or southerners. These men brought their own arms and required nothing but ammunition. Their dress, though not uniform, was generally a pair of short drawers coming halfway down the thigh, a strong narrow band of considerable length tightly girt about the loins, a turban, and sometimes a cotton frock. Most of them wore a cloth round the waist, which likewise answered the purposes of a shawl. Their common arms consisted of a sword, shield and matchlock. Some of the Hetkaris, especially the infantry of Savantvadi used a species of firelock, the invention of the lock for the flint having been early received from the Portuguese. Every tenth man, instead of firearms, carried a bow and arrows which were useful in night attacks and surprises when firearms were kept in reserve or forbidden. The Hetkaris excelled as marksmen but they could seldom be brought to the desperate sword-in-hand attacks for which the Mavails were famous. Both of them had unusual skill in climbing, and could mount a precipice or scale a rock with ease, where men of other countries must have run great risk of being dashed to pieces. Every ten men had an officer called a Naik and every fifty a Havaldar. The officer over a hundred was termed Jumladar and the commander of a thousand was styled Ek-hazari. There were also officers of five thousand, between whom and the Sarnobat or chief commander there was no intermediate step. The Cavalry was of two kinds. Bargirs, literally bridlemen or riders who were supplied with horses and shiledars who were self-horsed; Shivaji's bargirs were generally mounted on horses, the property of the state. A body of this description was termed pagah or household troops, and Shivaji always placed more dependence on Bargirs than on the Shiledars or any horse furnished on contract by individuals; with both he had a proportion of his pagah mixed, to overawe the disobedient and to perfect his system of intelligence which abroad and at home penetrated into a knowledge of the most private circumstances, prevented embezzlement, and frustrated treachery. The Maratha horsemen were commonly dressed in a pair of tight breeches covering the knee, a turban which many of them fastened by passing a fold of it under the chin, a frock of quilted cotton, and a cloth round the waist, with which they generally girded on their swords in preference to securing them with their belts. The horseman was armed with a sword and shield; a proportion in each body carried matchlocks, but the great National weapon was the Spear, in the use of which and in the management of their horses they showed both grace and skill. The Spearmen had generally sword and sometimes a shield; but the shield was unwieldy, and was carried only in case the spear should be broken. Over every twenty-five horsemen Shivaji had a havildar. To one hundred and twenty- five there was a jumladar, and to every five jumlas or six hundred and twenty- five was a Subhedar. Every Subha had an accountant and auditor of accounts appointed by Shivaji, who were liable to be changed and were invariably Brahmans or Prabhus. To the command of every ten subhas or six thousand, two hundred and fifty horse, which were rated at only five thousand, there was a commander styled Panch-hazari with whom were also stationed a Muzumdar or Brahman auditor of accounts and a Prabhu registrar and accountant called Amin. These were government agents. Besides these, every officer, from the jumladar upwards, had one or more karkuns or writers paid by himself as well as others in the pay of government. Except the Sarnobat or chief, no officer was superior to the commander of five thousand There was one sarnobat for the cavalry and one for the infantry. Every jutnla, subha, and panch-hazari had an establishment of news-writers and spies besides secret intelligencers. Shivajis head spy was a Ramoshi named Bahirji Naik. The Marathas are peculiarly roused from indolence and apathy when charged with responsibility. Shivaji at the beginning of his career personally inspected every man who offered himself, and obtained security from some persons already in his service for the fidelity and good conduct of those with whom lie was not acquainted. This system of security must soon have made almost every man answerable for some of his comrades; and although it could have been in most instances but a form, owing to the ease with which the responsibility could be evaded, the demand of security was always a part of Shivajis instructions to his officers. The Mavlis sometimes enlisted, merely on condition of getting a subsistence in grain; but the regular pay of the infantry was 1 to 3 pagodas [A pagoda was equal to from Rs. 3 to Rs. 4.] a month; that of the bargis or riders, was 2 to 5 pagodas and that of the shiledars or self-horsed cavaliers 6 to 12 pagodas a month. All plunder as well as prizes was the property of government. It was brought at stated times to Shivajis darbar or place of public audience and individuals formally displayed and delivered their captures. They always received some small proportionate compensation; they were praised, distinguished, and promoted according to their success. In fact to collect plunder from the enemy's ranks was usually regarded by the Marathas to express a victory, of which in their estimation it could be the only tangible proof. The horses, especially at an advanced period of Shivaji's history, were subsisted during the fair season in the enemy's country; during the rains they were generally allowed to rest, and were cantoned in different places near kurans or pasture lands, under the protection of some fort, where the grass of the preceding season was stacked and grain prepared by the time they returned. For this purpose persons were appointed to whom rentfree lands were hereditarily assigned. The system was preserved when many of Shivaji's institutions were neglected, and it proved a great aid to the success of his countrymen. Shivaji kept the Hindu festival of the Dasara with great pomp. It falls in October at the end of the south-west rains, and was particularly convenient for a general muster and review of his troops previous to their taking the field. At this time each horse was examined and an inventory and valuation of each soldier's effects were taken to be compared with what he brought back or eventually to be made good. If a horseman's effects were unavoidably lost, his horse killed, maimed, or destroyed in government service they were on due proof replaced. On the other hand, all plunder or articles discovered, of which no satisfactory account could be given, were carried to the credit of government, either by confiscating the article or deducting the amount from the soldier's arrears. It was at the option of the captors to keep almost any articles if fairly brought forward, valued, and paid for. The, accounts were closed every year, and balances due by government were paid either in ready money or by bills on the collectors of revenue in favour of the officers, but never by separate orders on villages. The only exceptions to plunder made by Shivaji were in favour of cows, cultivators, and women; these were never to be molested. His system of intelligence was the greatest check on every abuse, and his punishments were rigorous. Officers and men who had distinguished themselves, who were wounded, or who had suffered in any way, were always gratified by promotion, honour or compensation. Shivaji did not approve of the jagir or estate system; he confirmed many, but, with the exception of the establishment for his forts, he seldom bestowed new military estates and gave away very few as personal assignments, Inam Lands were granted by him as well in reward of merit as in conformity with the tenets of his faith; a gift of land, especially to Brahmans, being of all charities the most acceptable to the divinity. Shivaji's discipline, which required prompt obedience to superiors in every situation, was particularly strict in his forts. The chief person or Killedar in the command of a fortress was termed Havaldar and under him there was one or more sarnobats. In large forts there was a sarnobat to each face. Every fort has a head clerk and a commissary of grain and stores; the head clerk, a Brahman was termed Sabnis; the commissary was commonly of the Prabhu caste and was called Karkhannis. The orders regarding ingress and egress, rounds, watches, and patrols, care of water, grain, stores, and ammunition were most minute, and the head of each department was furnished with distinct rules for his guidance from which no deviation was allowed. A rigid economy characterised all Shivaji's instructions regarding expenditure. The garrison was sometimes partly composed of the common infantry. Independent of them, each fort had a separate and complete establishment. They were maintained by permanent assignments of rent- free lands in the neighbourhood of each fort, which with the care of the fort passed from father to son. The Ramoshis and Mahars were employed on outpost duty. They brought intelligence, watched all the paths, misled inquiries, or cut off hostile stragglers. This establishment while new and vigorous was admirably suited to Shivaji's purpose as well as to the genius of the people. The Gadkaris described the fort as the mother that fed them, and among other advantages, no plan could better provide for old or deserving soldiers. Shivaji's revenue arrangements were founded on those of Dadoji Konddev, Shahaji's Brahman manager, to whom Shivaji's education in Poona was entrusted (1641) [D.V. Kale: Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj p. 27.]. The assessments were made on the actual state of the crop, the proportionate division of which is stated to have been three-fifths to the husbandmen and two fifths to government. As soon as Shivaji got permanent possession of any territory, every species of military contribution was stopped, all farming of revenue ceased, and the collections were made by agents appointed by himself. Every two or three villages were superintended by karkun under the tarafdar or Talukdar who had charged of a small district, and was either a Brahman or a Prabhu. A Maratha havildar was stationed with each of them. Over a considerable tract there was a Subhedar or Mamlatdar who had charge of one or more forts in which his collections both of grain and money were secured. Shivaji never permitted the deshmukhs and deshpandes to interfere in the management of the country; nor did he allow them to collect their dues until their amount had been ascertained, when an order was annually given for the amount. The patil's, khots and kulkarnis were strictly superintended, and Shivaji's government though popular with the common cultivators, would have been unpopular with village and district officers, of whom Shivaji was always jealous, had it not been for the recourse which all had of entering his military service. The method which the Brahman ministers of the Maratha government afterwards adopted, of paying the military and civil servants by permanent assignments on portions of the revenue of villages, is said to have been early proposed to Shivaji. He objected to it, not only from fear of immediate oppression to the husbandmen, but from apprehending that it would in the end cause such a division of power as must weaken his government and encourage the village and district authorities to resist it as they frequently did that of Bijapur. With the same view he destroyed all village walls and allowed no fortification in his territory which was not occupied by his troops. Religious establishments were, carefully preserved, and temples for which no provision existed had some adequate assignments granted to them, but the Brahinans in charge were obliged to account for the expenditure. Shivaji never sequestrated any allowance fixed by the Muhammedan government for the support of tombs, mosques, or saints' shrines. The revenue regulations of Shivaji were simple and judged by the standards of those times undoubtedly judicious. People were encouraged to clear the jungles, raise crops and revive the village panchayats. They were further assured that the authorities would not take anything more than whatever be due according to law. This persistent effort to foster the rule of law and create an atmosphere of security endeared him to his people, it is just possible, however, that his judicious measures may not have been attended with immediate improvements and prosperity to the people as is sometimes alleged; for his districts were frequently exposed to great ravages, and he never had sufficient leisure: to complete his arrangements by that persevering superintendence which alone can perfect such institutions. The Muhammedan writers, and Fryer, a contemporary English traveller describe his country as in the worst possible state, and the former only mention him as a depredator and destroyer. Still those districts taken by him from Bijapur which had been under the management of farmers or direct agents of government undoubtedly experienced great benefit by the change. The judicial system of Shivaji in civil cases was that of panchayat or council which had invariably obtained in the country. Disputes among his soldiers were settled by their officers. He drew his criminal law from the Hindu sacred works or Shastras; but as the former rulers were Musalmans they had naturally introduced changes which custom had sanctioned and perpetuated. This accounts for the difference that long afterwards persisted between Hindu law and Maratha usage. To aid in the conduct of his government, Shivaji established eight offices; 1st the Peshwa or head manager whose office was held by Moro Pant or Moreshvar Trimbak Pingle; second the Muzumdar or general superintendent of finance and auditor general of accounts, whose office was held by Abaji Sondev, Subhedar of the province of Kalyan; third the Surnis or general record-keeper, superintendent of correspondence, examiner of letters; the office was held by Annaji Datto; fourth the Vanknis or private record- keeper and superintendent of the household troops and establishment; the office was field by Dattajipant; fifth the Sarnobat or chief captain of whom there were two, Prataprao Gujar over the cavalry and Yesaji Kank over the infantry; sixth the Dabir or minister for foreign affairs, an office held by Somnathpant; seventh the Nyayadhish or superintendent of justice, an office managed by Niraji Ravji and Gomaji Naik; and eighth the Nyaya Shastri or expounder of Hindu law, an office held first by Shambhu Upadhya and afterwards by Raghunathpant. The officers at the head of these civil situations, except the Nyayadhish and Nyaya Shastri, held military commands and frequently had not leisure to superintend their duties. All therefore were aided by deputies called Karbharis who often had power to fix the seal or mark of their principals on public documents. When so empowered they were styled Mutaliks. Each department and every district establishment had eight subordinate officers under whom were an adequate staff of assistants. These officers were. 1st the Karbhari, Mutalik or Divan; 2nd the Muzumdar or auditor and accountant; 3rd the Fadnis or Fadruvis deputy auditor and accountant; 4th the Sabnis or clerk sometimes styled Daftardar: 5th the Karkhannis or commissary; 6th the Chitnis or correspondence clerk; 7th the Jamdar or treasurer in charge of all valuables except cash; and 8th the Potnis or cashkeeper. Attached to himself, Shivaji had a treasurer, a correspondence clerk, and an accountant besides a Farisnis or Persian secretary. His clerk was a Prabhu named Balaji Avji, whose astuteness and intelligence were remarked by the English at Bombay on an occasion when he was sent there on business. Balkrshnapant Hanmante, a near relation of Shahajis head manager was Shivajis accountant. On Shivaji's enthronement at Raygad in 1674 the names of such offices as were formerly expressed in Persian were changed to Sanskrt and some were marked by higher sounding titles. There was only one Sarsenapati or commander-in-chief for the infantry and cavalry and one Nyayadhish or judge [Grant Duffs Marathas, 206'-:207. Shivaji's Ministers in 1674 with New Titles were, Moropant Pingle - Mukhya Pradhan, Ramchandrapant Bavdevkar - Pant Amatya, Annaji Datto - Pant Sachiv, Dattajipant - Mantri, Hambirrao Mohite - Senapati, Janardanpant Hanmunte - Sumant, Balajipant - Nyayadhish, Raghunathpant - Panditrav. In May 1673 a detachment of Shivaji's Mavlis surprised Parali about four miles south- west of Satara. Its capture put the Musalman garrisons on the alert, and Satara, a fort that had always been kept in good order by the Bijapur government, which was next invested, sustained a siege of several months and did not surrender till the beginning of September. It is remarkable that this fort which had long, perhaps before the Adil Shahi Dynasty, been used as a slate prison, often became the prison of Shivaji's descendants in later years. The forts of Chandan, Vandan, Pandavgad, Nandgiri, and Tathvad all fell into Shivaji's hands before the fair season [Grant Duffs Marathas, 202. Satara was captured on 27 July and after the capture of Satara Shivaji installed his Guru in the neighbouring hill for of Parali or Sajjangad, and guides still point out the tourists the seat on the top of the Satara hill from which Shivaji used to hold conversation with the saint across 4 miles of the space (Sarkar- Shivaji p. 193 and p. 363).]. In 1675 Shivaji again possessed himself of all the forts between Panhala in Kolhapur and Tathvad. As soon as he was occupied in Konkan and had carried down all the infantry that could be spared, Nimbalkar and Ghatge, the deshmukhs of Phaltan and Malavdi, attacked Shivaji's garrisons, drove out the posts and recovered most of the open country for Bijapur [Grant Duff's Marathas, 208.]. In 1676 Shivaji for the third time took possession of the open country between Tathvad and Panhala. To prevent future inroads by neighbouring proprietors Shivaji gave orders to connect the two places by a chain of torts, which he named Vardhangad, Bhushangad, Sadashivgad, and Machhindragad. Although of no great strength they were well chosen to support his intermediate posts and to protect the highly productive tract within the frontier which they embraced. While engaged in this arrangement Shivaji was overtaken by a severe illness which confined him at Satara for several months. During this period he became extravagantly rigid in the observance of religious forms, but he was at the same time planning the most important expedition of his life, the invasion of the Madras Karnatak [Grant Duff's Marathas, 209.]. The discussion of his legal claim to share in half his father's Karnatak possessions and the possibility of making this a cloak for more extensive acquisitions in the south was a constant subject of consultation [Grant Duff's Marathas, 213.]. While Shivaji was in the Karnatak a body of horse belonging to Ghatge and Nimbalkar laid waste Panhala in the south and retired plundering towards Karad. A detachment from Shivaji's army under Nilaji Katkar overtook them at Kurli, attacked and dispersed them, recovering much valuable property, which, as it belonged to his own subjects, Shivaji scrupulously restored [Grant Duff's Marathas, 221]. In 1679, Shivaji's son Sambhaji joined \\"the Moghals [According to Sardesai, Sambhaji joined the Moghals in 1678 but the fort was captured in 1679 (Sardesai-New History of Marathas Vol. 1 p. 251 and Sarkar-Shivaji p. 317).]. Diler Khan the Moghal general, intent on making Sambhaji the head of a party in opposition to his father, sent a detachment of his army from before Bijapur which they had invested, accompanied by Sambhaji as Raja of the Marathas, and took Bhupalgad in the Khanapur sub-division Shivaji's easternmost outpost [ Grant Duffs Marathas, 225.]. At the time of his death in 1680, Shivaji, who during the last two years of his life had become an ally of Bijapur against the Moghals, possessed that part of Satara of which the line of forts built from Tathvad to Panhala distinctly marked the eastern boundary Shinganapur in the Man sub- division in the east with the temple of Mahadev was his hereditary inam village given by one of the Ghatges to his father Shahaji [Grant Duffs Marathas, 231.]. Ramdas Svami, Shivaji's guru or spiritual guide, whose life and conduct seem to have deserved the universal praise of his countrymen, a few days before his death in 1682 January wrote to Sambhaji his elder son from Parali an excellent and judicious letter, advising him for the future rather than upbraiding him for the past, and pointing out the example of his father yet carefully abstaining from personal comparison [Grant Duffs Marathas, 238.]. The name of Ramdas Swami is closely associated with many places in Satara region. On the completion of his all India pilgrimage he settled at Masur north of Karad near the river Krshna, in about 1644. After staying there for about three or four years he shifted to Chaphal where he continued his practice of celebrating the annual Ramnavmi festival for which Shivaji, is reported to have made an annual grant of 200 hons or about Rs. 700. There is some controversy as to the nature of relationship between Ramdas and Shivaji as also about the exact year in which they met each other, one side advocating that Ramdas met Shivaji as early as in 1649 and initiated him into his favour, while the other advocating that the two could not have met each other earlier than in 1672 [G. S. Sardesai: New History of Marathas, Vol. I, p. 266.]. Even accepting the later year i.e. 1672 as the one of their actual meeting it should be taken into account that their spheres of activity in which they worked for over thirty years, overlapped each other. Under the circumstances it is highly improbable that they might not have heard of each other. In fact there is ample indirect evidence to believe that the two held each other in high respect [G. S. Sardesai: New History of the Marathas Vol. I, p. 265,]. There is however no first hand evidence to prove that Shivaji ever took his inspiration from Ramdas for his political mission. Similarly there is also no first hand evidence to show that Ramdas's teaching which had been first purely religious, developed a secular and political character later because he was influenced by Shivajl's activities. It must be remembered that Ramdas started collating his famous Dasbodh in 1654, the piece-meal composition of which must have been done much earlier[Patra-Sar-Sangraha-1039.]. In 1676 Samarth Ramdas at the request of Shivaji came to stay at Parali which soon came to be known as Sajjangad [Patra-Sar-Sangraha, 1864.]. On Shivaji's return from the Karnatak campaign in 1678 Shivaji was apprised of the misconduct of his son Sambhaji whereupon Shivaji asked him to go to Samarth Ramdas at Sajjangad and stay with him for some time, hoping of course that the association of the saint would bring about the required change in his son's conduct. Unfortunately the hope was not realised, for Sambhaji soon chose a moment to escape from Sajjangad with the object of joining Diler Khan. After Shvaiji's death. Rajaram his younger son was placed on the throne at Raygad by his mother Soyarabai, who was supported by Shivaji's confidential secretary Balaji Avji.  Post 1848  The present district of Satara owes its administrative evolution to the several changes that took place, first during the British rule, and subsequently during the post-independence period till as late as the year 1960. The core of the district was supplied by the Satara Principality after its lapse in the year 1848. Several boundary and sub-divisional adjustments were later on made with the neighbouring districts, like Solapur district, and with the lands of the neighbouring Indian princes. With the merger of the Princes' territories in 1947, the district was enlarged and divided into North Satara and South Satara. in 1960, the North Satara reverted to its original name Satara, South Satara being designated as Sangli district. The district, accordingly, has eleven talukas and petas.

Goapele is known to incorporate messages of politics, love, romance, and struggle into her music. The second single, \\"Right Here,\\" is a love song produced by Drumma Boy. On August 28, 2011, Goapele released the third single, \\"Play,\\" a sensual song produced by Dan Electric & Teddy Thunderbolt. Recording Break of Dawn was recorded at the Zoo in Downtown Oakland, California, home of Goapele‚Äôs Skylight Studios.

She said that she was liberating herself a little more and claims while there was something very empowering about appearing in a T-shirt without make-up on the cover of her first internationally distributed album, Even Closer, there is something equally empowering about shedding her fears of music-industry exploitation and strutting confidently into more brazen territory.

Structure Senior executives come in two echelons: *First level: Directors Generals and Chief of Departments (about 400 executives) *Second level: Directors of Division and heads of peripheral units (about 3,500 executives) First and second level positions are identified in each ministry. Management responsibilities (supervision of one or more bureaux) determine whether or not someone is an executive, not qualifications. This objective approach shows the exact number of first level executives and permits the development of a database with up-to-date information about age, seniority, gender, level and ministry. In each ministry, second level positions are further classified accordingly to the responsibilities attached to their offices position, corresponding to the classification adopted by the ministry. Until October 2002, the Senior Civil Service was meant to be an inter-ministerial homogeneous body, managed by a pool known as the \\"Ruolo Unico dei Dirigenti\\" (Uniform Register). The creation of this structure, under the supervision of the Prime Minister, was the backbone of the reform conducted from 1993 till 2001. It was underpinned by a database of jobs and profiles. This tool allowed the government to publish available positions in real time and to establish a labour market for managers. The new text adopted in 2002 has replaced inter-ministerial management of executives with ministerial management. However, the inter- ministerial database and the labour market for first level executives have been kept. Other public bodies, at national and local level, have their Senior Civil Services. Today senior civil servants are grouped into eight different contractual areas: * I (Ministries), * II (Regions and Territorial Autonomies), * III (National Health Service - administrative), * IV (National Health Service - medical), * V (School), * VI (Fiscal and economic Agencies), * VII (University), * VIII (Prime Minister's Office). Civil servants below executive level have a different contract with separate grading and pay arrangements. Recruitment Executives are normally recruited through competitions. There are two types of competition: *the ‚ÄúFast Stream Programme‚Äù (‚ÄúCorso-Concorso di Formazione Dirigenziale‚Äù) is for people who join the Public Administration School (\\"Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione\\") after a highly selective national exam, immediately getting a senior rank position. The curriculum of this school covers 30 months of alternating theoretical training - mostly in organisational sociology - and practical training - with many hands-on problems - and internships, often at the European Commission or other international bodies. On completion, students have to pass another examination. Depending on their results, graduates select their future ministry. The level required for every applicant is a master's. Applicants may be students, Italian or foreign government executives or private sector managers. The Public Administration School actively encourages the emergence of a team spirit in all basic training programmes. Graduates from the first classes have set up an association whose aim is to disseminate innovation in the public administration. Moreover, courses are not only taught by government executives but also by academic researchers, which leads to training partnerships with the universities; *the second type is a competition organised by the ministries. The prerequisites and training standards are less strict than as for the first type. Candidates who pass this competition follow a programme of almost one year at the Public Administration School. The executive group is increasingly targeting people from the private sector, universities and regional entities, which currently account for 10% of first level executives and 8% of second level. External candidates can only be hired for a fixed term. Appointment and tenure The status of executives has been governed by private law since 1998. A collective bargaining agreement (drafted by ARAN, the agency representing the public employer and the executives' trade union), stipulates the management conditions required in individual contracts. In other words, a senior executive signs two contracts: *a permanent contract with the ministry where he is employed; *a fixed-term contract with his or her supervisor (secretary-general of the ministry for first level executives, and first level executives for second level executives). Fixed-term contracts may not exceed three years for first level executives and five years for executives. These contracts set out the remuneration terms. In 2002, the minister was given the job of setting objectives, which must be very precise, reducing the role of the contract. Achievement of the objectives is nevertheless verified every year based on management control and strategic- planning results. First level SEOs must be confirmed by every new government, or they lose their position. Performance assessment and pay The pay structure emphasizes workload, merit and work performance (\\"pay for performance\\"), while it has no regard to seniority and length of service. Pay is based on: *a fixed wage (60% of the remuneration); *a portion (20%) linked to the responsibility attached to the position, corresponding to different pay grades adopted by the ministry (three levels at the Civil Service Ministry - A-B-C - and five at the Finance Ministry - A-B-C-D-E). This classification is transparent and published by every ministry; *a percentage (20%) tied to the achievement of objectives. Executives are subjected to an annual assessment based on achievement of objectives, the adequacy of actions implemented in compliance with ministerial directives and the information supplied by the management-control and strategic-assessment service. Executives whose contract expires are assessed to determine whether to keep and/or to promote them. Assessment disputes are reviewed by an appeal committee. When an executive cannot immediately find a new position on termination of a fixed-term contract, he /she keeps part of his fixed wage (60% of the remuneration). Promotion and mobility An executive's career does not follow a straight line. On completion of a fixed-term contract, he or she can move from a grade C position to a grade A position if assessment results are highly satisfactory. In order to encourage both internal promotion and competition, 40% of the positions of director generals may be filled by second level executives and 10% by non-government personalities. When the \\"rotation\\" obligation was formally withdrawn in the decree of October 2002 (probably because of shorter contracts), the principle of mobility was preserved. It is supported by an inter-ministerial database with real-time vacancies at every ministry. Five-year stints in the private sector and international organisations are also encouraged. These do not affect the executive's career. Training and learning Continuing education is covered by a directive from 2001 whose purpose was to galvanise training plans, considered a primary tool for leading change at government services. Today, training must be mentioned in resumes published in the interministerial database. The purpose of this requirement is to give executives a strong incentive to get trained. In order to promote the use of management methodologies and recognition of international concerns in executive actions, executives are now entitled to work for up to five years in the private sector or in international organisations with the right to return to the executive group without loss of prerogatives. Lastly, line managers can become researchers. A plan launched by the Public Administration School allows interested executives to research useful government modernisation themes under research teachers. History =Background of reforms= In February 1993, a founding legislative decree introduced contracts for officials who are now employed under general labour laws. *a new agency, ARAN, which represents the public employer in negotiations with unions and is responsible for drafting collective bargaining agreements; *a separation between political responsibilities (indirizzo politico) and administrative responsibilities (responsabilit√† dirigenziale ); *a new senior management profile: new values, new responsibilities, new management methods; *the development of an inter-ministerial pool of executives responsible \\"for the results of the activity managed by their offices and the execution of programmes and projects entrusted to them in the light of productivity objectives and for financial, technical and administrative management results, including organisational and personnel management decisions.\\" =Reform initiatives and results= While the decree of 1993 remains the basis for every senior management reform, three periods can be distinguished, each of which raised contractualisation to a new level: a) 1993 to 1998: the \\"privatisation\\" recommended in the working note did not yet apply to first level executives. Their appointments and performance obligations remained the minister's responsibility. Their pay reflected standard scales. Other managers were governed by collective bargaining agreements. b) 1998 to 2002: collective bargaining agreements became applicable to first level executives. They signed fixed-term contracts under private law specifying objectives and pay. The reform created an inter- ministerial management structure. In principle, all executives should have been lumped in this pool, which the ministries could have sourced for needed profiles. In fact, the ministries remained in control, trying to keep their best executives. Mobility was boosted by the development of an inter- ministerial database with the resumes of all first level executives and a list of available positions updated in real time. The years ahead can be expected to lead gradually to the creation of a genuine labour market. c) Since October 2002: the appointment and objectives of first level executives are fixed by decree (unilateral public act). Their pay is negotiated bilaterally and laid down in a private contract signed for the term of their appointment (3 years or less). The \\"ruolo unico dei dirigenti\\" has made way for ministerial pools but the inter-ministerial database continues to be used. The objective remains to promote mobility. =Objectives and new competencies= The newly organised \\"dirigenza\\" became the launch pad for the modernisation of public management. The new management of senior management has made the civil service more politically neutral and, as such, has clarified the respective roles of politics and the civil service. The main purpose of the newly created dirigenza was to remedy the lack of professionalism and the political bias of the hallowed senior public service by fostering a culture of excellence within the government and promoting close relations based on shared principles combining the founding values of the civil service - integrity, neutrality and impartiality - with the more pragmatic qualities demanded from managers. This ethics of accountability remains the cornerstone of all texts adopted since 1993.

History Adams County was formed in 1797 as the fourth county of the Northwest Territory which would soon form the state of Ohio. The first county seat was in Manchester but no courthouse was ever built at that location. The first official county seat of the territory was Adamsville and the county officials met in various locations, as, like Manchester, no courthouse was constructed. The Ohio General Assembly moved the county seat to West Union, the current county seat, and plans for a courthouse were drafted. This first courthouse was a simple log structure of oak, poplar, walnut and blue ash. The courthouse stood two stories high and had a footprint of 30 feet by 24 feet. This structure was replaced in 1811 by a stone and brick building. This building also stood two stories high with a pitched roof resting on an unadorned entablature. A cupola rose from the roof line and could be seen around the town. The building remained until 1876 when a new courthouse was constructed. It was around this time that Manchester unsuccessfully petitioned to be named the county seat. The present courthouse replaced the courthouse of 1876 after a fire wiped out the structure and all of the court records. Constructed from 1910 to 1911 by architect T.S. Murray, the building was built from a bond passed that raised $50,000. Exterior The building was built with yellow bricks with unadorned rectangular windows. The entrances were lined with red brick pilasters supporting a pediment roof. The roof was flat with a balustrade. A rectangular tower rises from the center of the building and is crowned with four arches supporting a dome. The dome is relatively unadorned and houses a four-faced clock. Renovation in 1975 saw a northern addition containing a courtroom, jail, office space, and the county sheriff's living quarters (which was formally retired in the late 1990s). The front portico was also added and includes four bottom pilasters supporting a balcony, with four pilasters supporting the pediment above. Interior The main entrance contains a unique decoration, a mounted head of the white-tailed deer commonly found throughout Ohio. The 27-point buck was found frozen in a creek by local boys Steven & Donnie Swayne and Tommy Dryden, who then carried the head of the deer back to town. The find caused much debate, as the wildlife officer for Adams County claimed the buck was found dead and did not belong to anyone. After much debate and petitions, the head made its way to the courthouse in 1976 and has been proudly displayed in the courthouse ever since.http://www.osegsportsmens.com/html/adams_county_courthouse_buck.html Gallery File:AdamsCountyOHCourthouse2.JPGCowboy Copas Ohio Historical Marker File:AdamsCountyOHCourthouse3.JPGCowboy Copas Ohio Historical Marker File:AdamsCountyOHCourthouse4.JPGHowitzer on courthouse lawn File:AdamsCountyOHCourthouse5.JPGBell from second Adams County Courthouse 1811 - 1876 File:AdamsCountyOHCourthouse6.JPGAdams County War Memorial File:AdamsCountyOHCourthouse7.JPGHowitzer on courthouse lawn File:AdamsCountyOHCourthouse8.JPGDeer head above main entrance References Further reading *Thrane, Susan W.; County Courthouses of Ohio, Indiana University Press; Indianapolis, Indiana 2000 *Marzulli, Lawrence J.; The Development of Ohio's Counties and Their Historic Courthouses; Gray Printing Company; Fostoria, Ohio 1983 *Stebbins, Clair; Ohio's Court Houses; Ohio State Bar Association; Columbus, Ohio 1980 External links *Description of courthouse *Picture of courthouse before portico addition circa 1930 Category:Buildings and structures in Adams County, Ohio Category:County courthouses in Ohio Category:Georgian architecture in Ohio Category:Government buildings completed in 1911 Category:Clock towers in Ohio Category:1911 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Adams County Courthouse (Ohio)"},{"id":"23858788","text":"V≈°echovice is a village and municipality (obec) in P≈ôerov District in the Olomouc Region of the Czech Republic.

Contents taken from Sarasvati's Children article, written by Joe Lobo, the President of the Goan Catholic Association in Florida. This article has been borrowed mainly from Alan Machado's above book. While most Goan Catholics remained in Goa, some did not accept the leadership of the Portuguese and emigrated to many British colonies of India. History Goans first worked for the British in 1779 at the time of the French Revolution, when the naval fleet of the British India Government was stationed in Goa. The British found the Christian Goans were eminently suitable because of their Western dress, diet and customs and when the fleets withdrew from Goa some time afterward, the Goans went with them. Goans who trained at the medical school also moved to other Portuguese colonies around 1842 after the first medical school was created Goans migrated to British India as well where there were more opportunities and economic development was occurring, which led to a demand for English language schools for these migrants which surpassed that of those educated in Portuguese. However, such was the demand that Goans began sending their children to neighbouring cities such as Bombay, Poona and Belgaum. Employment opportunities also arose in Karachi, Pakistan.

He specializes in landscapes, using traditional techniques of Chinese ink-wash painting, but he has also devoted much time to oil paintings. He is a retired professor of the Department of Fine Arts, Sichuan Normal University and has been invited to teach and paint in Japan, France, Thailand and Germany. In 2007 he painted The Lenten Veil for the German Catholic charity Misereor. He has exhibited several times with the French Jesuit Beno√Æt Vermander (aka: Bendu), including in the R√©fectoire des Jacobins (Toulouse, 1996), the European Parliament (Strasbourg, 1996), the National Gallery (Beijing, 1997) and the Sichuan Gallery (Chengdu, 1997). In 1995-1996, at the invitation of the Regional Council, he conducted a series of paintings of landscapes of the Midi-Pyrenees region (Toulouse and surrounding areas). A number of these paintings were reassembled in the Veilleur De Jour collection, published in Toulouse in 1996. In 2000-2001, for the four hundredth anniversary of the presentation of the missionary Matteo Ricci to the Chinese Emperor (1601), Li Jinyuan departed from Macerata, to follow the trail to Beijing taken by the Italian Jesuit. The resulting series of paintings inspired an exhibition at Sophia University in Tokyo in December 2001. Between 1995 and 1999, his time spent in France and also in Thailand enhanced the brightness and variety on his palette. From about 1999, he began a stylistic transformation, creating experimental works that mixed Chinese ink with golden acrylic. The oil paintings he created from 2002-2003 were characterized by a scarce use of colour and the application of aesthetic principles of contemporary wash painting. The paintings are strikingly dramatic as they were often inspired by the landscapes of ethnic minority areas in Sichuan, which is an economy remarked for its methods of expression.

Gallipoli, Italy, cross over skull and crossbones in the church Oratorio Confraternale delle Anime del Purgatorio (1660). Actual skulls and bones were long used to mark the entrances to Spanish cemeteries (campo santo). The practice, dating back many centuries, led to the symbol eventually becoming associated with the concept of death. Some crucifixes feature a skull and crossbones beneath the corpus (the depiction of Jesus' body), in reference to a legend that the place of the crucifixion was also the burial place of Adam or, more likely, in reference to the New Testament statement (King James Version: Matthew 27:33, Mark 15:22, and John 19:17) that the place of his crucifixion was called \\"Golgotha\\" (tr. \\"the Place of a Skull\\"). Today, an example of a real skull and crossbones may be seen in the 1732 Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar church overlooking the famous Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It contains several altars rescued from other early Spanish churches in South America. One of these has twenty rectangular window boxes arrayed behind and above the altar, five wide by four tall. The size of these glass window boxes is such that the femurs of the priests thus interred are a bit too long to lie flat and so must be leaned up in an \\"X\\" formation. The other bones fill in the spaces around the femurs with the skull sitting prominently on top of the bone pile centered above the \\"X\\".

She made her first on-screen appearance on 21 September 2009 and was introduced by series producer Lucy Allan as a new student at Hollyoaks Community College. Kingston was given the role after she entered and won an online competition run by Hollyoaks Desperately Seeking. In November 2010, it was announced that India would be murdered. India was murdered by Silas Blissett on 23 December 2010. India returned in 2011 when Texas portrayed her in a reconstruction of her death. India again returned in 2012. Kingston has stated that she was happy to leave the show before being typecast in the role. India has been portrayed as a \\"posh bird\\" and is narrow- minded, having a tendency to \\"rub people up the wrong way\\". She is also described as sensible and \\"strait-laced\\". Many of India's early storylines revolved around her wanting to \\"fit in\\" among her fellow students, sleeping with Archie Carpenter (Stephen Beard), feuding with Hayley Ramsey (Kelly-Marie Stewart) and a \\"will-they-won't-they\\" relationship with Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood). The relationship led to jealousy between Josh and his brother Rhys (Andrew Moss) resulting in India fighting for her life after a car crash caused by Josh. India's later storylines involved the arrival of her sister Texas (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove), sleeping with Jamil Fadel (Sikander Malik) and a brief relationship with homosexual Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan) who used her to hide his sexuality. Her most prominent and final storyline saw her online dating and despite being vigilant to begin with, agreeing to meet with a man named Cameron, which led to her being murdered by Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle), who had been posing as him. India returned on 10 August 2011 when Silas saw Texas as India. On 5 and 10 July 2012, India again returned, appearing in her sisters nightmares. Character creation and casting In June 2009, it was announced that the Hollyoaks producers were looking for an actress to play the role of India Longford. The search was organised by Hollyoaks production house Lime Pictures through Hollyoaks Desperately Seeking, in the hope of discovering the show's \\"next Roxanne McKee\\" who successfully gained the role of Louise Summers after winning competition Hollyoaks: On The Pull in 2004. Women aged between 18 and 30 were invited to download an audition script and upload a video of themselves performing the script to the official Hollyoaks Desperately Seeking website. Speaking of the project, Hollyoaks series producer Lucy Allan said: \\"We are very excited about opening the audition process to a wider audience and hope to find that special raw talent that we found in Roxanne and Marcus [Patric] (who portrayed Ben Davies) in the ‚ÄòOn The Pull‚Äô series.\\" In June 2009, the competition closed and Desperately Seeking announced that they had received 1679 votes. Three finalists were picked; Sophie Louise Craig, Brooke India Burfitt-Dons and Beth Kingston. On 4 July 2009, Sonny Flood (who portrayed Josh Ashworth) appeared on T4 live to announce that Kingston had been cast in the role of India. She began filming her scenes on 10 July. Kingston said \\"I was really excited and elated to get down to the last 25, never mind the last six, then three then go on to win. I've been bonding with the girls all week coordinating what we were going to wear on T4! I wasn't nervous up until the point we walked into the T4 studio and when they shouted my name out, I couldn't believe it. I was in pure shock. I can't wait to tell my family. When I was told that I was starting filming with Hollyoaks on Monday, I realised how quick a turnaround it is working on a soap! I'm just elated.\\" Character development Unlike her fellow students, India appeared to have a dislike for partying, drinking alcohol and eating junk food. Due to her being from an upper-class family, this made it hard for India to settle in, especially with Hayley Ramsey. Hollyoaks producer Henry Swindell spoke to Digital Spy about the character's personality: \\"India's well-to-do, a little naive and in a world that she's not used to. But more than that, she's quite good at saying the wrong thing, rubbing people up the wrong way without realising it. A key part with the role of India is that she's got to fit in well with the rest of the student group.\\" During December 2010, Hollyoaks producers announced a murder plot involving India. In the plot, India would begin online dating and be murdered by Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle) after agreeing to meet a man named Cameron. The Hollyoaks team worked closely with the University of Central Lancashire's Cyberspace Research Unit to raise awareness of internet safety. Dr Jo Bryce of the university spoke of India's murder, saying, \\"If the storyline can remind one young person to protect themselves when engaging in online activity, then that can only be a positive thing. Too many youngsters think they are immune to online risks and this storyline is a reminder that you don't always know who you're talking to online.\\" Series producer Paul Marquess also commented on the plot: \\"This is a terrifying murder that highlights the dangers of meeting strangers online\\". The storyline, which launches at Christmas, will take us right through 2011 and audiences will be gripped to find out if the dangerous killer will strike again.\\" Discussing her exit, Kingston said, \\"It's going to be very upsetting because it comes as such a shock in the episode. She is in such a happy mood, she thinks she's found the one and she's talking about the future and is really hopeful about everything. And it's such a horrible thing that happens.\\" Storylines India first appears as a new student in Hollyoaks College, where she moves into the Halls with Josh Ashworth, Dave Colburn, Charlotte Lau and Hayley Ramsey. She makes a bad first-impression on Charlotte and Hayley, who feel India is stuck up. India makes inappropriate comments about Charlotte's sexuality and is also accused by Hayley of stealing her food. Despite India protesting her innocence, Hayley places laxatives in her pizza. India and Dave decide to get revenge on Hayley by eating her food. India eats the pizza and subsequently the laxatives. In a competition held by Neville Ashworth to win a car, India, Josh, Dave, Charlotte and Hayley are all inside trying to win it, when India begins to suffer as a result of Hayley's trick. She wins the car, despite her embarrassment, for being the last person left touching it. She later makes up with Hayley but leaves the college. India returns a few weeks later at Halloween, where she begins playing practical jokes on the students. Once she reveals herself, she explains that her parents told her she should return to college and face her bullies. India and Dave then befriend mentally disabled Spencer Gray, who quickly develops a crush on her. India grows close to Josh. However, both are using one another to make Calvin Valentine and Hayley jealous. India kisses Calvin, who is hesitant due to his feelings for Mercedes Fisher. During a Christmas party, India kisses Josh. During a night out at the loft Josh and India kiss again they both then decide to go on to another party along with Dave and Sasha Valentine Josh drives them all unaware his brother Rhys Ashworth had been spiking his orange juice with vodka due to this Josh crashes the car India is the only one left unconscious by the crash and is rushed to hospital fighting for her life while Josh is arrested. India recovered soon after, and along with Rhys' help, made a full recovery and they soon developed feelings for each other. India admitted her feelings to Rhys and they began going out as they both feel special with one another, little did India know that Rhys was the one that actually spiked Josh's drink, nearly killing her in the process. India and Rhys begin a short relationship which ends when Rhys realises his brother needs him. In May, India, and the rest of the students visit a mansion which hosts a murder mystery game to celebrate India's 20th birthday, where the students dress up as stereotypical American horror film characters; India plays a cheerleader. However, the game is never completed as Charlotte, who is meant to play the murderer, runs away with Molly, the game host, and the pair sleep together. India's sister, Texas Longford, turns up and they both end up leaving the mansion with Dave in a car which India thinks they stole, leaving Charlotte and the other students behind. India is relieved to discover the car actually belongs to Texas. Upon leaving the mansion, India, Texas and Dave arrive back in Hollyoaks to witness the fatal shooting of Calvin Valentine on his wedding day. In the aftermath of the shooting, India is left in shock, having seen someone die right in front of her. India currently works at Cindy Hutchinson's boutique shop. Texas returns to Hollyoaks, and India and Texas' grandfather, Alistair Longford also arrives. Cindy Hutchinson saves Alistair from choking, and he proposes to her. Alistair has stopped providing money for India and Texas, the latter of whom is skint. After her grandfather and Cindy get married and move off, India has new bosses in Heidi Costello and Gabby Sharpe. As both of her bosses have different styles, India finds it difficult to please both and usually ends up pleasing none. Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan) begins flirting with India in order to hide his homosexuality. However, he ends up mocking her. India gets even more fed up when her friends begin online dating and encourages them to be safe by writing down some tips and advice and places it on the fridge. But out of curiosity, she tries online dating herself and starts talking to a good looking man who claims to be called Cameron through the internet. She is on her way to meet him when she spots a middle aged man (Silas Blissett) whose car has broken down. Shortly after she lends him her phone to call for breakdown assistance, she soon realises he is Cameron, when he says her name. A struggle then ensues when she tries to fend him off attempting to escape from him, but he murders her. He then wraps her body in an old carpet, drives into a nearby woods and dumps her body into a pit. To cover up his tracks, he steals her ring and then texts Nancy who sends a text to India's phone asking if she was fine, making it clear that she is not. At the end of the episode the camera pans to the fridge, showing India's online safety advice, noting to viewers that India has completely ignored her own advice that has cost her life. Her body is then found the next day on Christmas Eve by Jack Osborne and Duncan Button. Texas films a reconstruction of India's murder Silas sees Texas as India. When Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) is murdered, Texas has dreams and visions about India.

They are named for Hudson Street, which runs adjacent to Mapfre Stadium in Old North Columbus. History In 1996, half brothers Grant Thurmond and Cord Andrews and their friend Drew Abdalla were children when they watched Major League Soccer team Columbus Crew SC's first season. When the three men entered Ohio State University, they continued walking down Hudson Street to reach the stadium. Their enthusiasm for the team had not waned despite the soccer team's unexceptional performance which dissuaded people from attending their games. In 2006, to reinvigorate Columbus Crew SC's fan base, Thurmond, Andrews, and Abdalla formed the independent supporters' group Hudson Street Hooligans. In a 2012 interview with The Lantern, Andrews said, \\"We called ourselves the Hudson Street Hooligans because we had to walk up Hudson to get to the stadium.\\" Beginning in 2006, the club met at the local bar Ruby Tuesday (not the restaurant) during game days. In July 2010, HSH had 500 members. In August 2011, the club grew to nearly 1,000 members. Hudson Street Hooligans Club In 2009, as HSH membership significantly increased, it was decided that the group's leadership would open a private, member's only bar. The group opened a pub, the Hudson Street Hooligans Club, in June 2010. The pub was formed as a private club so that liquor license would be less expensive. In August 2011, the club had around 700 members who supported the group with dues. To drink at the pub, members paid $10 for a social membership and $20 for full membership, which included a T-shirt and embroidered patch. The Columbus Dispatch noted in 2011 that the \\"Hooligans pub is thought to be the only private, licensed club in the state created solely for the purpose of supporting a professional sports team\\". Although they opened their own pub, the club members intended to sustain their patronage at Ruby Tuesday. In July 2011, the city of Columbus withdrew the pub's certificate of occupancy, citing code violations that rendered the building hazardous for a pub and gathering place. One code violation was the lack of firewalls to stop fires from traveling from the club to neighboring businesses and apartments on top of it. Another was that the club did not have several exits and exit signs, which could be problematic if there was an emergency.

Benson's popularity was such that she was caught 63 times in 13 years, although the accessibility that made her popular was also the cause of controversy among angling's elite. She has also been referred to as \\"the people's fish\\" and was voted by readers of Angler's Mail as Britain's Favourite Carp in 2005. The fish, who was female, was originally one of a pair: her original companion, Hedges, disappeared in a flood of the River Nene in 1998. Both fish were named due to a hole in Benson's dorsal fin that resembled a cigarette burn, in a reference to Benson & Hedges. At her peak weight, in 2006, she weighed . Benson died on 4 August 2009, aged 25. At the time of her death, she weighed the same as a large dog and was worth ¬£20,000. The owner of the lake where she lived alleged that she was accidentally poisoned by anglers using uncooked tigernuts as bait, though evidence points to the contrary (see section on death below). Another possible cause of death was the complications during egg production. Fame Benson lived in the Kingfisher Lake at the Bluebell Lakes complex, at Tansor just outside Oundle in Northamptonshire. She was one of approximately 150 carp in Bluebell Lakes, which are managed \\"to provide the best environment for growth potential of the fish\\". Steve Broad, editor of UK Carp magazine, ascribed Benson's fame to \\"her accessibility\\": However, this very accessibility made the fish controversial among the sport's elite: \\"Everyday anglers loved her because there was a chance they could have their photo taken with one of the big fish ... some serious anglers did not like her because she was open to everyone.\\" Benson's record of being caught so often masks her unpredictability. \\"There was a period when Benson was caught every Monday for six weeks. Then it seemed that she disappeared for the next 12 months.\\" Death The Daily Telegraph reported in August 2009 that the fish had been \\"poisoned\\": Benson's successor as a popular and very large common carp may not live too far away from the fish's former haunt. \\"The same complex where Benson lived boasts a lot of promising 40 lb fish. There's one‚Äîthe Z-Fish‚Äîthat is ounces under 50 lb and still growing.\\" It has since been confirmed that the most likely cause of death was not nut poisoning, but rather reproductive complications due to gravidity.

Seksualiti Merdeka features a programme of talks, forums, workshops, art, theatre and music performances, interactive installations, and film screenings, organised by a coalition of Malaysian NGOs, artists and individuals. Merdeka is the name for Malaysia's Independence Day (Aug 31), hence Seksualiti Merdeka can be loosely translated as \\"Sexuality Independence\\". Overview The first Seksualiti Merdeka was held in August 2008, coinciding with Merdeka celebrations. It drew a crowd of about 400‚Äì500 people. The theme of Seksualiti Merdeka 2009 is ‚ÄúOur Bodies, Our Rights,‚Äù which reflects the organisers' wish to tie LGBT rights into the larger framework of human rights, based in part on the Yogyakarta Principles. It drew a crowd of 800‚Äì1000 people. In November 2011, the festival was banned on the grounds that it could cause public disorder. Background Seksualiti Merdeka was founded by arts programmer Pang Khee Teik and singer-songwriter Jerome Kugan in 2008. Pang and Jerome have previously been involved in LGBT advocacy, for example, in 2003, together with Shanon Shah, Tan Beng Hui, Toni Kasim, Jac SM Kee, and others, they were involved in the handing of a Memorandum to the Human Rights Commission on the negative portrayal of effeminate men and masculine women in the Malaysian media. As writers, they have also regularly written and read their gay stories in public. In 2008, Clarence Singham, co- founder of Singapore's pride festival IndigNation, invited Pang to organise a Malaysian programme within it. Pang then organised a segment called \\"Heartbreak Heroes: Four Malaysians on surviving love, loss & a hostel in Singapore\\", in which Pang, Kugan, activist Jac SM Kee and historian Farish A. Noor read their original writings. The experience inspired Pang and Kugan, who both work for The Annexe Gallery, to organise a similar kind of event within their arts space. Seksualiti Merdeka 2008 The first Seksualiti Merdeka took place on 29‚Äì31 August 2008, with the tagline \\"If one of us ain't free, none of us are!\\".

It did not fly well and the biplane configuration was out-dated at completion; the only one constructed was later turned into a monoplane and led to the Handley Page H.P.54 Harrow. Design and development In 1928 Imperial Airways issued two sets of tenders, one for a large four-engined airliner and the other for a smaller, three-engined one. The first led to the very successful Handley Page H.P.42 but the second type did not get beyond the design stage as Imperial later decided that they did not want it. Nonetheless, when Air Ministry specification C.16/28 was issued, calling for a replacement bomber-transport for the Handley Page Clive and Vickers Victoria, Handley Page offered a design which used the tri-motor's wings and engine mountings married to a new monocoque fuselage with gun positions and a revised tail. The Air Ministry ordered a prototype with the proviso that it should have a more familiar fabric covered and gauze windowed fuselage of tubular construction. This aircraft was the H.P.43. Only two other manufactures had submitted types in competition: the Vickers Type 163 was accepted as a private venture only and the Gloster TC.33 prototype was ordered after the specification had been widened to include four-engined types. Like the H.P.42, the H.P.43 was an unequal-span biplane with unswept and unstaggered wings of constant chord. Both used a Warren girder biplane construction, with two pairs of strongly outward-leaning struts linked by an inward-leaning pair on each wing. This layout avoided the need for bracing wires. Both types had dihedral on upper and lower outer wing sections, combined with marked anhedral in the centre section of the lower wing, a feature that optimised the view from the passenger aircraft because the wing was attached to the top of the fuselage and kept the single-wheeled undercarriage legs, mounted at the end of the centre section, short and widetrack. The lower pair of engines were also mounted at this point, on top of the wing. Both types carried ailerons and leading edge slots on the upper wing only. In contrast, not only did the H.P.43 have a smaller span (114 ft compared with 130 ft on the H.P.42) but the upper and lower planes had nearly equal chord, unlike the sesquiplane H.P.42. The H.P.43's third Bristol Pegasus IM3 radial engine was mounted centrally on the upper wing with bracing to the upper fuselage longerons. The H.P.43 fuselage was slab-sided, tapering slightly to the tail. The nose extreme housed an open gunner's position with a bomb aimer's window below, immediately in front of an enclosed, side-by-side cockpit for the pilot and navigator. There was a wireless operator's position behind them. The H.P.43 was required to be a 30-seat troop carrier, so there were seats, windows and a port side door amidships. The tail gunner sat in another open position at the end of the fuselage, aft of a twin-finned monoplane tail unit. The elevators were large and projected well beyond the fixed horizontal tail. The H.P.43 flew for the first time at Radlett on 21 June 1932. After some modifications it went to RAF Hendon in June 1933, where it was not well received by pilots from RAF Martlesham Heath who found it lacking performance and heavy on the controls. During its construction the RAF saw the H.P.43 as outmoded and set to be replaced by monoplane bomber and transport designs; surprisingly the H.P.43 took part in this transition when its fuselage and empennage were adapted to take a high monoplane wing bearing two engines and emerge as the H.P.51, the forebear of the Harrow.

History The first note about the village comes from 1518, but the village is probably older because a note from 1531 refers to a parish church, and parish churches were situated in locally older settlements. It is speculated that original village's name was Odendorf and was later renamed for unknown reason.

A settlement in the place existed before this date but it was not officially recognized and was considered to be a part of Nov√© Losiny. A history of Jind≈ôichov was started in 1862 when a paper mill and an apartment building for workers were built. An investor was Joseph Abraham Winternitz. The place was chosen because of the rich water source the Brann√° River and deep forests which can be exploited for cellulose. A railway access with rest of Austria-Hungary was opened in 1888 as well as an access with Prussia via Hlucholazy what caused a growth of factory production and thus building of new workers' apartments and necessary infrastructure. The factory had 750 employees in 1920. Its functioning caused strong pollution of Brann√° river. Because the Communist government wasn't really interested in environmental problems, the situation went better in the late 1990s. During the communist era from 1948-1989, the number of employees increased again. An eight-floor-high block of flats was erected for the workers' accommodation and was described by known Czech architect David V√°vra as \\"the purest example of total incomprehension of place ‚Äì of a deep High Ash Mountains valley.\\" He also said: \\"The block of flats was designed in 80‚Äôs by Stavoprojekt company and it looks as a devil illusion till nowaday.\\"≈†umn√° mƒõsta TV show, episode of ≈†umn√Ω ≈†umperk The paper mill was closed in 2011 due financial problems. Thus caused enormous unemployment. The new owner, The Kar Group, announced that he wanted to start production again; however, just tens of people will be hired. Economy The economy of the village has always been connected with the paper mill. The factory's closure in 2011 caused a high unemployment rate, which was 31,7% in 2012. For comparison, the rate was 14,7% in 2008 when the factory was going well.http://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo/tabparam.jsp?voa=tabulka&cislotab;=AGTPR6010PU_OB1.164&vo;=null Remoteness of Jind≈ôichov and bad public transport connection don't help residents with finding jobs.

Demography Eccentric block of flats Jind≈ôichov village has never been a separate statistical unit, and thus all dates are population numbers from Jind≈ôichov together with the population from nearby villages without self- administration. 1310 people lived in the area administered by Jind≈ôichov in 2012.

First Story's strap line is 'Changing Lives Through Writing'. Its stated mission is to empower young people from low-income communities to find their own voices and, in doing so, to thrive in education and in life. The charity primarily works in state secondary schools serving low-income communities and its operating regions are Greater London, the East Midlands and the North of England. First Story's flagship programme places professional writers into schools for one or two terms. These Writers-in-Residence work intensively with a group of students and their teachers to develop confidence, creativity and writing ability. The programme culminates in the publication of an anthology of students' writing, edited by their Writer-in-Residence. First Story professionally produces over 60 new publications every year and each anthology has a unique cover design and ISBN. In addition to its core programme offer, the charity also runs creative writing competitions and events for programme participants. The charity's current Chief Executive is Antonia Byatt, a former head of arts organisations English PEN and the Cheltenham Literature Festival. Its current Chair of Trustees is Ed Baden-Powell and Patron is Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall. In the 2018-19 academic year, First Story worked in 73 schools across England and 1,565 students (aged 11-16) completed its intensive Writer-in-Residence programme. History First Story was founded in London in 2008 by a former Teach First teacher, Katie Waldegrave, and a professional writer, William Fiennes, to provide young people in state education with extra-curricular support to develop their confidence, creativity and writing ability. Fiennes and Waldegrave met in 2007, when she was a history teacher at Cranford Community College in west London, and he was the Writer-in-Residence at the fee-paying American School in London. Together they developed a plan to bring Fiennes' creative writing expertise into Waldegrave's less well- resourced state school. Based on the success of this pilot project, a year later the pair founded First Story. The organisation's registered charitable objectives are: # To advance the education of students in secondary schools in low-income communities by providing facilities for education in creative writing that aren‚Äôt required to be provided by the local education authority. # To help young people advance in life by providing support, opportunities and activities which foster their creativity, literacy and talent, in order to build self-confidence, skills and aspiration so they may grow to full maturity as individuals and members of society. # To promote the arts and, in particular, literature, poetry and creative writing, by inviting, commissioning and maintaining the services of British writers (whether such services require payment or otherwise), and by encouraging and assisting in the promotion, advancement and publication of the works of British writers. As First Story's first Executive Director, Katie Waldegrave oversaw the charity's growth from one school in London, to more than 50 participating schools nationally. She stepped-down from day-to-day running of the organisation in 2014, but remains actively involved as a trustee. The organisation still adhere's to Fiennes' philosophy and creative writing pedagogy and he remains close to the organisation as a trustee.

Held by tradition to mark the birthplace of St David, the ruin cannot be accurately dated but is unusual in that it is aligned north-south rather than the usual east-west. Near to the ruined chapel is a retreat, a modern chapel and a holy well. The site was protected in the 1950s and is now the responsibility of the Welsh Heritage organisation Cadw. History The ruined Chapel of St. Non is close to the Pembrokeshire Coast Path a few miles from the city of St David's. According to Christian tradition, Saint Non (also known as Nonna or Nonnita) was born around AD 475 and was a daughter of Lord Cynyr Ceinfarfog who lived as a nun at Ty Gwyn near Whitesands Bay until she was raped by Prince Sant of Ceredigion. She gave birth at Caerfai to a boy, who became the patron saint of Wales, St David. The ruin is thought to be on the site of St Non's house and to be one of the oldest Christian buildings in Wales. In medieval times the chapel was one of the main sites visited by Christian pilgrims. Following the Protestant Reformation, pilgrimages stopped and the chapel was converted into a house before being used as a garden. The Grade II listed site was taken over by the Welsh Heritage organisation Cadw in the 1950s. St Non's Cross St Non's Cross A large stone standing in the corner of the ruined chapel, inscribed with a cross within a circle, is known as St Non's Cross. The stone was found in the same field as the chapel and is either a grave or an altar stone. The stone is dateable to the 7th to 9th century, but there is no firm evidence that it originally came from the site. Standing stones In the chapel field there are a number of standing stones which may be evidence of an Iron Age settlement. It is possible that the chapel was built within an original pagan circle of standing stones. Holy well Shrine at St Non's Chapel A holy well close to the chapel () was thought to have healing properties, and to this day visitors throw coins into the well for luck. Records of a survey of St. David's by Browne Willis in 1717 state that \\"there is a fine Well beside it [St. Non's Chapel], cover'd with a Stone-Roof, and enclos'd within a Wall, with Benches to sit upon round the Well. Some old simple People go still to visit this Saint at some particular Times, especially upon St. Nun's Day (March 2nd) which they kept holy, and offer Pins, Pebbles, Etc at this well\\", and reports from 1811 state that \\"the fame this consecrated spring has obtained is incredible and it is still resorted to for many complaints\\". It was thought to be particularly effective for eye problems and was restored in 1951 by the Catholic Church, which also erected a shrine using stones from nearby ruins. The vaulting over the well replaced ruins of medieval stonework in the 18th century. Water from the well was used by Pope Benedict during his visit to Britain. Modern chapel Chapel of Our Lady and St Non A modern chapel () was built near the ruin in 1934 by Cecil Morgan-Griffiths, a solicitor from Carmarthen, using stone from ruined local chapels. He had built a house (now used as a retreat) overlooking the sea, and the nearest Catholic church was over sixteen miles away, so he decided to build one on the historic site. The new chapel is the most westerly in Wales and is also one of the smallest, as it is only 25 feet long by 12 feet wide. It has stained glass windows representing St Non, St David, St Bride, St Brynach and St Winifred. The stoup at the door is all that remains of the Chapel of the Fathoms, and the altar uses a white stone from the altar of St Patrick's Chapel. The window over the altar is in the school of William Morris. Cecil Morgan-Griffiths died the year after the new chapel was completed. Retreat Behind the modern chapel is St Non's Retreat (). Owned by the Passionist Fathers (a religious institute founded by Saint Paul of the Cross)Catholic Encyclopedia Article and run as a registered charity by the Sisters of Mercy, the retreat offers a place of sanctuary and reflection, as well as workshops and sessions ranging from yoga to support for bereaved parents.

The consortium is referred to as \\"Deep Vision\\". The aim is to improve the economics of geothermal energy production. Its strategy is to look at the usefulness of supercritical hydrothermal fluids as an economic energy source. This necessitates drilling to depths of greater than in order to tap the temperatures of more than . The drilling is at a rifted plate margin on the mid-oceanic ridge. Producing steam from a well in a reservoir hotter than ‚Äîat a proposed rate of around should be sufficient to generate around 45 MW. If this is correct, then the project could be a major step towards developing high-temperature geothermal resources. \\"Deep Vision\\" recognized at its inception that much research would be needed regarding the poorly understood supercritical environment and as such sought to promote inclusion of the wider scientific community. Funding has come from the members of the consortium, the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program and the US National Science Foundation. This project has also been used for purposes such as university research. Researchers from UC Davis, UC Riverside, Stanford University, and the University of Oregon have taken the opportunity to collaborate with each other and the IDDP. They have aimed their investigation to gain information about extracting energy from hot rocks on land. To do this, they have been gathering important information from the borehole they sunk where seawater circulates through deep, hot rock. This should give important new clues about black smokers, hydrothermal vents that spew minerals and superheated water deep below the ocean. These support unique microorganism communities living within them. First Well, IDDP-1 The 49th Volume of the journal Geothermics, released in January 2014, is entirely dedicated to the first well of the IDDP. The borehole of this well was unintentionally drilled into a magma reservoir in 2009. The hole was initially planned to drill down to hot rock below , but drilling was ceased when the drill struck magma at only deep. This same occurrence has only been recorded once, in a Hawaiian geothermal well in 2007, but in that instance, it resulted in the sealing and abandonment of the hole. In IDDP-1 the decision was made to continue the experimental well, and upon inserting cold water into the well, which was over . The resultant well was the first operational Magma-EGS, and was at the time the most powerful geothermal well ever drilled. While not producing electricity on the grid, it was calculated that the output of the well would have been sufficient to produce 36 MW of electricity.http://iddp.is/wp- content/uploads/2014/01/News-in-English-16-01-2014.pdf World's first magma-EGS system created, 16 January 2014 The well was eventually shut down after a valve failure occurred while attempting to connect the output to a central generator.  Second Well (continuation of an old borehole), IDDP-2  Five years before IDDP-1 was made, a borehole was drilled at Reykjanesvirkjun. It was named RN-15 or REY H015 (Reykjanes-15) and is just one of many geothermal boreholes drilled in the Reykjanes peninsula since 1956. It reached a maximum depth of 2.5 km (1.55 mi).https://www.hsveitur.is/images/2007.pdf It was always known that RN-15 could be deepened, after a good result of the drilling.http://iddp.is/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/SAGA_REPORT_2006.pdf About 10 years later, IDDP decided to continue drilling under the project name IDDP-2.http://iddp.is/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SAGA-REPORT-No-10.pdf The plan was to reach a maximum depth of 5 km (3.11 mi) before the end of 2016, making it by far the deepest borehole in Iceland. Scientists were hoping to reach a temperature of ,http://iddp.is/wp- content/uploads/2016/09/Uppl%C3%BDsingaskilti_rev.pdf which would be the hottest blast of any hole in the world, breaking the former record of the IDDP-1 Krafla borehole. Drilling began on August 11, 2016, and was completed 167 days later on January 25, 2017. The final depth was , with a temperature of and fluid pressure of . Core samples were taken, showing rocks at the bottom that appeared to be permeable, and fluids in supercritical conditions were successfully reached, accomplishing all of the main objectives of the drilling operation.

From 1920, the village is named as Ruda nad Moravou, literally \\"Ore above Morava river\\" to make the name more specific. In old Latin sources, the municipality is named Ferreus Mons, Iron Mountain. Germans called the village as Eisenberg with meaning the Iron Mountain as well. History The first written mention about Ruda nad Moravou is from 1350 when iron ore was mined. Lord Bernard ze ≈Ωerot√≠na built a renaissance ch√¢teau in the early 17th century which is abandoned today and in poor condition. The village was heavily stroke by events of Thirty Years' war. In 1896, the settlement was divided to two parts, the Czech Horn√≠ Ruda (Upper Ruda) and the Sudeten German Doln√≠ Ruda (Lower Ruda). This two villages were united again in 1920. Distillery was established in 1838, operating to 1934. Its architecturally valuable Empire building has been preserved. During the interwar period, manufactories producing sweets, gingerbread and buttons as well as a tannery were situated in the municipality. About 120 Sudeten Germans lived in Ruda nad Moravou in 1930, all of them were expelled after World War II. In 1960 the village of Hostice was joined to the Ruda nad Moravou municipality.

Pimsleur and Trish Donnally, articles.sfgate.com, September 24, 1997 and fashion retailer. She was a proponent of the art to wear movement and featured one-of-a-kind creations at her boutique Obiko, co-founded in 1972 on Sacramento Street, San Francisco, with Kaisek Wong, Alex Mate and Lee Brooks.Surface Newsletter, Volumes 9-12, p. 61 (1995) at She sought to showcase the work of artists she met in the San Francisco Bay Area. A Japanese-American, she was known for being an \\"exquisitely dressed\\" \\"dynamo\\" and traveled in the Far East. Her apartment included displayed some the goods she found in her travels. Background Sakata was born in Watsonville, California in 1940. She spent her early years in the Poston internment camp in Arizona. Sakata graduated from California State University, Chico and received a teaching certificate from the University of Hawaii. She worked as a flight attendant for Pan Am for six years before returning to San Francisco. In the mid-1970s she \\"found her true metier\\" and became a boutique owner. The Obiko boutique featured avantgarde window displays and sold the works of many San Francisco designers. Items sold included tie-dyed dresses, handwoven scarves, hand-painted jackets and handcrafted jewelry. \\"I had met so many talented artists in San Francisco, and I wanted to showcase their work\\", Sakata recounted in a 1995 interview. \\"I didn't want to just line the clothes up on a rack. I created a total environment of paintings, antiques, sculpture and flowers to set a mood for the clothing and jewelry.\\" Sakata played an important role in promoting the wearable art movement. She inspired designers to produce jewelry, hand knits, woven fabrics, and hand-dyed silks inspired by ethnic influences worldwide that are emblematic of the \\"art-to-wear\\" movement. These designs were included at the flagship store, located on Sutter Street near Union Square. She expanded her Obiko boutique in 1983 with an outpost at the Bergdorf Goodman store in New York, which closed in 1997.

The species was first described by Johann Siegfried Hufnagel in 1767. Subspecies Subspecies Scopula rubiginata ochraceata Staudinger, 1901 is mostly treated as a species, Scopula ochraceata. Etymology The Latin species name rubiginata means \\"rusty\\", with reference to the coloration of the wings. Distribution and habitat This species is present from the Iberian Peninsula up to the Ural. In the North its range extends to Denmark and Southern Sweden and Finland. It is not present in most of the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula (with the exception of Gibraltar), Sicily and the southern Greek islands. In Morocco it is found in the Atlas mountains. Furthermore, it is also present in North Turkey, the Caucasus and the Crimea. Eastwards, its range stretches through southern Siberia, the northern central Asian mountains up to Mongolia. These moths preferably inhabit sandy terrain, such as sand dunes dry-warm environment, grasslands and heath, at an elevation up to above sea level. A live specimen of Scopula rubiginata Description Scopula rubiginata has a wingspan of 16‚Äì22 mm. These moths are rather small in size in comparison to other geometrids. They present a rather high variability in basic color and drawings. The basic color depends on the humidity. Arno Bergmann: Die Gro√üschmetterlinge Mitteldeutschlands. Band 5/1, Spanner Verbreitung Formen und Lebensgemeinschaften. Urania-Verlag, Jena 1955. As a matter of fact wings may be tawny, pale brown, violet-reddish, greyish or straw-coloured, with darker brown or darker reddish, transverse and slightly wavy markings (hence the common name of the species) on the upper sides. The inner transverse line is missing on the hind wings. Similar markings are present on the under sides. The apex of the forewings is rounded. The hindwing margin is uniform, almost round. The fringes are paler than the basic color. The eggs are approximately cylindrical. The surface is covered with 16 distinct longitudinal ribs. The caterpillars are relatively slender and a bit thicker towards the rear end. The color is variable, ranging from yellowish, brownish, slightly reddish to gray. The ventral side is greenish. The back shows a relatively thin line, but darker than the basic color, The head is relatively small, roundish and slightly reddish. The pupa is brown, with fine bristles. This species is quite similar to Idaea ochrata, but this last species shows a dented hindwing margin. Biology The moths fly in one (June to August), two (May to June and July to September) or three (in overlapping generations from April to October) generations depending on the location. These moths are day and night active, but especially from dusk onwards. At night, they come to artificial light sources. The moths were observed on the flowers of the following plants: figworts (Scrophularia canina), small rattle- pail (Rhinanthus minor), yellow mignonette (Reseda lutea), hoary ragwort (Senecio erucifolius), broad-leaved thyme (Thymus pulegioides), alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and carrot (Daucus carota). The larva feeds on various herbaceous plants, including knotgrass (Polygonum), Thymus glabrescens, Calluna vulgaris, Artemisia campestris, Rumex acetosella, Thymus serpyllum, Medicago lupulina, Vicia, Lotus, Trifolium, Cytisus scoparius, Thalictrum, Galium, Taraxacum officinale and Convolvulus arvensis. The partly grown larvae hibernate in the sward. Later they pupate in a cocoon amongst debris. References *Axel Hausmann: The Geometrid moths of Europe, 2. Sterrhinae.

The KBW contested the general elections in 1976 and 1980 in West Germany and was rated as the strongest of the German Maoist parties from 1974 until 1981. After 1982 the KBW was virtually inactive and was finally dissolved completely in 1985.  History  The KBW was formed at a conference held in Bremen in June 1973 as a fusion of various local communist groups from Heidelberg,Kommunistische Gruppe (Neues Rotes Forum), KG (NRF) Bremen,Kommunistischer Bund Bremen, KBB G√∂ttingen,Kommunistischer Bund G√∂ttingen FreiburgBund Kommunistischer Arbeiter, BKA etc. At its inaugural conference the KBW adopted a programme advocating the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism and the bourgeois state and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat in order to achieve a classless society and communism.See: Programme of the Kommunistischer Bund Westdeutschland In its programme the KBW demanded the arming of the people (‚ÄùAllgemeine Volksbewaffnung‚Äú). One of the main efforts of the KBW was the struggle against the Bundeswehr (Federal Armed Forces). It organized youth camps dedicated to ideological and practical training for the revolutionary struggle. Members of the KBW participated in violent demonstrations against nuclear power plants in West Germany (Brokdorf, Grohnde). On September 21, 1975 the KBW and his Committees against ¬ß 218 organized a demonstration of 25,000 people in Bonn against the German law prohibiting abortion. The KBW contested the general elections in 1976 and 1980 and several state (German Bundesland) and local elections. The organization obtained 20,018 votes or 0,1% in the 1976 elections21,414 first ballot votes (8,285 votes 1980). It won one seat in the Heidelberg city council in 1975 which was lost later. Strongholds of the KBW were university towns. The KBW headquarters moved from Mannheim to Frankfurt am Main in April 1977. When the Minister-President of Lower Saxony, Ernst Albrecht, proposed a ban on three maoist groups in 1977,German ban proposed on three groups, in: The Times, Sep 27, 1977; pg. 5 KBW, the maoist Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (KPD/AO) and the Communist Party of Germany/Marxist-Leninist (KPD/ML) demonstrated together in Bonn with about 16,000 supporters. The Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) was supported in its armed struggle by contributions from the KBW.Motto: Gewehre f√ºr die Jugend Zimbabwes (Rifles for the youth of Zimbabwe) ZANU politicians Ndabaningi Sithole, Robert Mugabe and Edgar Tekere visited West Germany several times at invitation of the KBW. The organization split in the summer of 1980 when about a quarter of the membership formed the League of West German Communists (Bund Westdeutscher Kommunisten; BWK), which continued to work on the basis of the KBW programme of 1973. In 1982 the KBW abandoned its objective of establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat and started to infiltrate The Greens (Die Gr√ºnen). Andreas K√ºhn: Stalins Enkel, Maos S√∂hne : die Lebenswelt der K-Gruppen in der Bundesrepublik der 70er Jahre. Campus Verlag. Frankfurt. 2005. p. 302ff. The official weekly KVZ and the theoretical organ KuK ceased publication at the end of 1982. Their successor, the monthly Kommune was not a KBW magazine anymore.  Structure  The organizational principle of the KBW was democratic centralism. Since 1977 the organization was divided into three regional (Nord, Mitte, S√ºd) and 40 district units. It had in the beginning a 13-member (later expanded) Central Committee and a five-member Standing Committee (St√§ndiger Ausschuss). The KBW had 900 members in 1973 and about 5,000 (with affiliated organizations) in 1977. Membership declined later due to the high demands the party made on their members, lack of success and the dramatic changes in the politics of the People's Republic of China. Secretary of the Central Committee's Standing Committee from 1973 until 1982 was Joscha Schmierer.  Activity  For a KBW activist a normal week looked as follows: Monday from 5.30am-7.30am the selling of the weekly Communist Peoples Newspaper (KVZ) in front of a factory gate or at the railway station, followed by a branch meeting on Monday evening. Tuesday started early again with KVZ sales, as did Wednesday. On Wednesday evening there was usually a training course based on an article from the theoretical organ \\"Communism and Class Struggle\\". On Saturday there was various public activity (mostly information stands with newspaper sales), and the whole of Sunday was devoted to the study of Marxist-Leninist classics. On free afternoons leaflets were distributed and more extensive training courses took place.  Electoral work  The KBW also took part in elections. In general elections, the KBW only got around 0.1 percent of the votes. More important was the actual number of people voting for the KBW (20,018). This gave a relative good indication of how many people of the time actually approved of the violent overthrow of the capitalist system . Other smaller revolutionary parties also got about 25,000 votes at this time (1976). The KBW had its biggest success in the communal elections of Baden-W√ºrttemberg in April 1975, when Helga Rosenbaum was voted onto the Heidelberg city council and used this as a platform to call for the violent overthrow of the Federal Republic. On September 16, 1976 she was expelled from this body by a vote of the majority parties.Intercontinental Press Vol. 14, No 41 of November 1, 1976 p. 1572  Finances  Contrary to most political parties, KBW had no major financial problems, with KVZ and other publications giving the party a healthy income. Another important factor was financial contributions from party members. There were no set party dues as such, rather, in each cell it was specified, what the individual member had to pay. Members in employment generally contributed one-third of their income. Added to that were the various donations that came in. Individual members brought in entire fortunes and inheritances. In the mid-1970s annual contributions and donations amounted to around 5 million DM and the income from the sales of the various publications was a further 2 million DM.  Orientation  The KBW subscribed to the ideas of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, whose writings were distributed through KBW bookshops (or later party offices). It sided with the politics of the Communist Party of China until 1980.

In April 1977, General Telephone and Electronics launched the first optical network, in Southern California. The next month, Bell launched an optical telephone system in Chicago. Since the 1970s, fiber networks have grown to service over 80% of the world‚Äôs data and voice traffic. Fiber optic cable is critical for 5G cellular networks. Through 5G, stakeholders in the wireless networking sector hope to achieve a multitude of performance gains over 4G. Achieving these goals requires denser fiber infrastructure. According to a Market Study Report, the 5G fiber optic cable market is expected to grow to $1.346 billion by the end of 2020.  Modern fiber management  Fiber optic network management is used to: Most organizations use software-based platforms, databases, and spreadsheets to execute these activities. With these tools, managers and installers can store data related to network components, connections, and tests that are valuable for planning future developments or troubleshooting issues as they arise. Fiber optic management systems can generate reports that describe various network data points, including cable section lengths, loss budgets, network capacity, optical loss, splice and termination locations. Operators can also store geospatial data and documents if GIS capabilities are available. Software-based fiber optic network management platforms with GIS features allow network managers to visualize cable routes and evaluate surrounding environments. There are many software-based fiber management systems today, such as:  Fiber maps  A fiber map is a visual representation of a fiber optic network. Fiber maps are often used in fiber optic network management. Most fiber mapping is done digitally using web-based, server-based, or desktop-based GIS platforms. GIS fiber mapping enables users to assess how networks are spatially distributed across real-world landscapes. Network operators can layer network data on different GIS basemaps to study how certain environmental factors impact network performance. Fiber maps can store thousands of data points describing different elements, including cables, patches, and termination points.

Solving this problem has been motivated by the desire to understand the motions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and visible stars. In the 20th century, understanding the dynamics of globular cluster star systems became an important -body problem.See references cited for Heggie and Hut. The -body problem in general relativity is considerably more difficult to solve. The classical physical problem can be informally stated as the following: The two-body problem has been completely solved and is discussed below, as well as the famous restricted three-body problem.A general, classical solution in terms of first integrals is known to be impossible. An exact theoretical solution for arbitrary can be approximated via Taylor series, but in practice such an infinite series must be truncated, giving at best only an approximate solution; and an approach now obsolete. In addition, the -body problem may be solved using numerical integration, but these, too, are approximate solutions; and again obsolete. See Sverre J. Aarseth's book Gravitational -Body Simulations listed in the References.  History  Knowing three orbital positions of a planet's orbit ‚Äì positions obtained by Sir Isaac Newton from astronomer John Flamsteed. A popularization of the historical events and bickering between those parties, but more importantly about the results they produced. ‚Äì Newton was able to produce an equation by straightforward analytical geometry, to predict a planet's motion; i.e., to give its orbital properties: position, orbital diameter, period and orbital velocity.See Having done so, he and others soon discovered over the course of a few years, those equations of motion did not predict some orbits correctly or even very well.Rudolf Kurth has an extensive discussion in his book (see References) on planetary perturbations. An aside: these mathematically undefined planetary perturbations (wobbles) still exist undefined even today and planetary orbits have to be constantly updated, usually yearly. See Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, prepared jointly by the Nautical Almanac Offices of the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Newton realized that this was because gravitational interactive forces amongst all the planets was affecting all their orbits. The above discovery goes right to the heart of the matter as to what exactly the -body problem is physically: as Newton realized, it is not sufficient to just specify the initial position and velocity, or three orbital positions either, to determine a planet's true orbit: the gravitational interactive forces have to be known too. Thus came the awareness and rise of the -body \\"problem\\" in the early 17th century. These gravitational attractive forces do conform to Newton's laws of motion and to his law of universal gravitation, but the many multiple ( -body) interactions have historically made any exact solution intractable. Ironically, this conformity led to the wrong approach. After Newton's time the -body problem historically was not stated correctly because it did not include a reference to those gravitational interactive forces. Newton does not say it directly but implies in his Principia the -body problem is unsolvable because of those gravitational interactive forces.See Principia, Book Three, System of the World, \\"General Scholium\\", page 372, last paragraph. Newton was well aware that his mathematical model did not reflect physical reality. This edition referenced is from the Great Books of the Western World, Volume 34, which was translated by Andrew Motte and revised by Florian Cajori. This same paragraph is on page 1160 in Stephen Hawkins, On the Shoulders of Giants, 2002 edition; is a copy from Daniel Adee's 1848 addition. Cohen also has translated new editions: Introduction to Newton's Principia, 1970; and Isaac Newton's Principia, with Variant Readings, 1972. Cajori also wrote History of Science, which is online. Newton said in his Principia, paragraph 21: Newton concluded via his third law of motion that \\"according to this Law all bodies must attract each other.\\" This last statement, which implies the existence of gravitational interactive forces, is key. As shown below, the problem also conforms to Jean Le Rond D'Alembert's non-Newtonian first and second Principles and to the nonlinear -body problem algorithm, the latter allowing for a closed form solution for calculating those interactive forces. The problem of finding the general solution of the -body problem was considered very important and challenging. Indeed, in the late 19th century King Oscar II of Sweden, advised by G√∂sta Mittag-Leffler, established a prize for anyone who could find the solution to the problem. The announcement was quite specific: In case the problem could not be solved, any other important contribution to classical mechanics would then be considered to be prizeworthy. The prize was awarded to Poincar√©, even though he did not solve the original problem. (The first version of his contribution even contained a serious errorFor details of the serious error in Poincare's first submission see the article by Diacu.). The version finally printed contained many important ideas which led to the development of chaos theory. The problem as stated originally was finally solved by Karl Fritiof Sundman for .  General formulation  The -body problem considers point masses in an inertial reference frame in three dimensional space moving under the influence of mutual gravitational attraction. Each mass has a position vector . Newton's second law says that mass times acceleration is equal to the sum of the forces on the mass. Newton's law of gravity says that the gravitational force felt on mass by a single mass is given byMeyer 2009, pp. 27‚Äì28 :\\\\mathbf{F}_{ij} = \\\\frac{G m_i m_j}{\\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q}_j - \\\\mathbf{q}_i\\\\right\\\\^2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{q}_j - \\\\mathbf{q}_i\\\\right)}{\\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q}_j - \\\\mathbf{q}_i\\\\right\\\\} = \\\\frac{G m_i m_j \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{q}_j - \\\\mathbf{q}_i\\\\right)}{\\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q}_j - \\\\mathbf{q}_i\\\\right\\\\^3}, where is the gravitational constant and is the magnitude of the distance between and (metric induced by the norm). Summing over all masses yields the -body equations of motion: : m_i \\\\frac{d^2\\\\mathbf{q}_i}{dt^2} = \\\\sum_{j=1 \\\\atop j e i}^n \\\\frac{G m_i m_j \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{q}_j - \\\\mathbf{q}_i\\\\right)}{\\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q}_j - \\\\mathbf{q}_i\\\\right\\\\^3} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}_i} where is the self-potential energy :U = -\\\\sum_{1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n} \\\\frac{G m_i m_j}{\\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q}_j - \\\\mathbf{q}_i\\\\right\\\\}. Defining the momentum to be , Hamilton's equations of motion for the -body problem becomeMeyer 2009, p. 28 : \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{q}_i}{dt} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{p}_i} \\\\qquad \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{p}_i}{dt} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}_i}, where the Hamiltonian function is :H = T + U and is the kinetic energy :T = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{p}_i \\\\right\\\\^2}{2m_i}. Hamilton's equations show that the -body problem is a system of first-order differential equations, with initial conditions as initial position coordinates and initial momentum values. Symmetries in the -body problem yield global integrals of motion that simplify the problem.Meyer 2009, pp. 28‚Äì29 Translational symmetry of the problem results in the center of mass :\\\\mathbf{C} = \\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \\\\mathbf{q}_i}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i} moving with constant velocity, so that , where is the linear velocity and is the initial position.

Rotational symmetry results in the total angular momentum being constant :\\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{q}_i \\\\times \\\\mathbf{p}_i, where √ó is the cross product. The three components of the total angular momentum yield three more constants of the motion. The last general constant of the motion is given by the conservation of energy . Hence, every -body problem has ten integrals of motion. Because and are homogeneous functions of degree 2 and ‚àí1, respectively, the equations of motion have a scaling invariance: if is a solution, then so is for any .Chenciner 2007 The moment of inertia of an -body system is given by : I = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \\\\mathbf{q}_i \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{q}_i = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{q}_i\\\\right\\\\^2 and the virial is given by . Then the Lagrange‚ÄìJacobi formula states thatMeyer 2009, p. 34 :\\\\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} = 2T - U. For systems in dynamic equilibrium, the longterm time average of is zero. Then on average the total kinetic energy is half the total potential energy, , which is an example of the virial theorem for gravitational systems.

Special cases  = Two-body problem = Any discussion of planetary interactive forces has always started historically with the two-body problem. The purpose of this section is to relate the real complexity in calculating any planetary forces. Note in this Section also, several subjects, such as gravity, barycenter, Kepler's Laws, etc.; and in the following Section too (Three-body problem) are discussed on other Wikipedia pages. Here though, these subjects are discussed from the perspective of the -body problem. The two-body problem () was completely solved by Johann Bernoulli (1667‚Äì1748) by classical theory (and not by Newton) by assuming the main point-mass was fixed, is outlined here.See Bate, Mueller, and White, Chapter 1: \\"Two-Body Orbital Mechanics\\", pp 1‚Äì49. These authors were from the Department of Astronautics and Computer Science, United States Air Force Academy. Their textbook is not filled with advanced mathematics. Consider then the motion of two bodies, say the Sun and the Earth, with the Sun fixed, then: :\\\\begin{align} m_1 \\\\mathbf{a}_1 &= \\\\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r_{12}^3}(\\\\mathbf{r}_2-\\\\mathbf{r}_1) &&\\\\quad\\\\text{Sun‚ÄìEarth} \\\\\\\\\\\\ m_2 \\\\mathbf{a}_2 &= \\\\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r_{21}^3}(\\\\mathbf{r}_1-\\\\mathbf{r}_2) &&\\\\quad\\\\text{Earth‚ÄìSun} \\\\end{align} The equation describing the motion of mass relative to mass is readily obtained from the differences between these two equations and after canceling common terms gives: , where * is the vector position of relative to ; * is the Eulerian acceleration ; *. The equation is the fundamental differential equation for the two-body problem Bernoulli solved in 1734. Notice for this approach forces have to be determined first, then the equation of motion resolved. This differential equation has elliptic, or parabolic or hyperbolic solutions.For the classical approach, if the common center of mass (i.e., the barycenter) of the two bodies is considered to be at rest, then each body travels along a conic section which has a focus at the barycenter of the system. In the case of a hyperbola it has the branch at the side of that focus. The two conics will be in the same plane. The type of conic (circle, ellipse, parabola or hyperbola) is determined by finding the sum of the combined kinetic energy of two bodies and the potential energy when the bodies are far apart. (This potential energy is always a negative value; energy of rotation of the bodies about their axes is not counted here) *If the sum of the energies is negative, then they both trace out ellipses. *If the sum of both energies is zero, then they both trace out parabolas. As the distance between the bodies tends to infinity, their relative speed tends to zero. *If the sum of both energies is positive, then they both trace out hyperbolas. As the distance between the bodies tends to infinity, their relative speed tends to some positive number.For this approach see Lindsay's Physical Mechanics, Chapter 3: \\"Curvilinear Motion in a Plane\\", and specifically paragraphs 3‚Äì9, \\"Planetary Motion\\"; pp. 83‚Äì96. Lindsay presentation goes a long way in explaining these latter comments for the fixed two-body problem; i.e., when the Sun is assumed fixed.Note: The fact a parabolic orbit has zero energy arises from the assumption the gravitational potential energy goes to zero as the bodies get infinitely far apart. One could assign any value to the potential energy in the state of infinite separation. That state is assumed to have zero potential energy by convention. It is incorrect to think of (the Sun) as fixed in space when applying Newton's law of universal gravitation, and to do so leads to erroneous results. The fixed point for two isolated gravitationally interacting bodies is their mutual barycenter, and this two-body problem can be solved exactly, such as using Jacobi coordinates relative to the barycenter. Dr. Clarence Cleminshaw calculated the approximate position of the Solar System's barycenter, a result achieved mainly by combining only the masses of Jupiter and the Sun. Science Program stated in reference to his work: Real motion versus Kepler's apparent motion The Sun wobbles as it rotates around the galactic center, dragging the Solar System and Earth along with it. What mathematician Kepler did in arriving at his three famous equations was curve-fit the apparent motions of the planets using Tycho Brahe's data, and not curve-fitting their true circular motions about the Sun (see Figure). Both Robert Hooke and Newton were well aware that Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation did not hold for the forces associated with elliptical orbits.See. I. Bernard Cohen's Scientific American article. In fact, Newton's Universal Law does not account for the orbit of Mercury, the asteroid belt's gravitational behavior, or Saturn's rings. Newton stated (in section 11 of the Principia) that the main reason, however, for failing to predict the forces for elliptical orbits was that his math model was for a body confined to a situation that hardly existed in the real world, namely, the motions of bodies attracted toward an unmoving center. Some present physics and astronomy textbooks do not emphasize the negative significance of Newton's assumption and end up teaching that his mathematical model is in effect reality. It is to be understood that the classical two-body problem solution above is a mathematical idealization. See also Kepler's first law of planetary motion. = Three-body problem = This section relates a historically important -body problem solution after simplifying assumptions were made. In the past not much was known about the -body problem for .See Leimanis and Minorsky's historical comments. The case has been the most studied. Many earlier attempts to understand the Three-body problem were quantitative, aiming at finding explicit solutions for special situations. *In 1687, Isaac Newton published in the Principia the first steps in the study of the problem of the movements of three bodies subject to their mutual gravitational attractions, but his efforts resulted in verbal descriptions and geometrical sketches; see especially Book 1, Proposition 66 and its corollaries (Newton, 1687 and 1999 (transl.), see also Tisserand, 1894). *In 1767, Euler found collinear motions, in which three bodies of any masses move proportionately along a fixed straight line. The Euler's three-body problem is the special case in which two of the bodies are fixed in space (this should not be confused with the circular restricted three-body problem, in which the two massive bodies describe a circular orbit and are only fixed in a synodic reference frame). *In 1772, Lagrange discovered two classes of periodic solution, each for three bodies of any masses. In one class, the bodies lie on a rotating straight line. In the other class, the bodies lie at the vertices of a rotating equilateral triangle. In either case, the paths of the bodies will be conic sections. Those solutions led to the study of central configurations, for which for some constant . *A major study of the Earth‚ÄìMoon‚ÄìSun system was undertaken by Charles-Eug√®ne Delaunay, who published two volumes on the topic, each of 900 pages in length, in 1860 and 1867. Among many other accomplishments, the work already hints at chaos, and clearly demonstrates the problem of so-called \\"small denominators\\" in perturbation theory. *In 1917, Forest Ray Moulton published his now classic, An Introduction to Celestial Mechanics (see references) with its plot of the restricted three-body problem solution (see figure below).See Moulton's Restricted Three-body Problem for its analytical and graphical solution. An aside, see Meirovitch's book, pages 413‚Äì414 for his restricted three-body problem solution.See Meirovitch's book: Chapters 11: \\"Problems in Celestial Mechanics\\"; 12; \\"Problem in Spacecraft Dynamics\\"; and Appendix A: \\"Dyadics\\". chaotic behaviour Moulton's solution may be easier to visualize (and definitely easier to solve) if one considers the more massive body (such as the Sun) to be stationary in space, and the less massive body (such as Jupiter) to orbit around it, with the equilibrium points (Lagrangian points) maintaining the 60¬∞ spacing ahead of, and behind, the less massive body almost in its orbit (although in reality neither of the bodies are truly stationary, as they both orbit the center of mass of the whole system‚Äîabout the barycenter). For sufficiently small mass ratio of the primaries, these triangular equilibrium points are stable, such that (nearly) massless particles will orbit about these points as they orbit around the larger primary (Sun). The five equilibrium points of the circular problem are known as the Lagrangian points. See figure below: Restricted three-body problem In the restricted three-body problem math model figure above (after Moulton), the Lagrangian points L4 and L5 are where the Trojan planetoids resided (see Lagrangian point); is the Sun and is Jupiter. L2 is a point within the asteroid belt. It has to be realized for this model, this whole Sun-Jupiter diagram is rotating about its barycenter. The restricted three-body problem solution predicted the Trojan planetoids before they were first seen. The -circles and closed loops echo the electromagnetic fluxes issued from the Sun and Jupiter. It is conjectured, contrary to Richard H. Batin's conjecture (see References), the two are gravity sinks, in and where gravitational forces are zero, and the reason the Trojan planetoids are trapped there. The total amount of mass of the planetoids is unknown. The restricted three-body problem that assumes the mass of one of the bodies is negligible. For a discussion of the case where the negligible body is a satellite of the body of lesser mass, see Hill sphere; for binary systems, see Roche lobe. Specific solutions to the three-body problem result in chaotic motion with no obvious sign of a repetitious path. The restricted problem (both circular and elliptical) was worked on extensively by many famous mathematicians and physicists, most notably by Poincar√© at the end of the 19th century. Poincar√©'s work on the restricted three-body problem was the foundation of deterministic chaos theory. In the restricted problem, there exist five equilibrium points. Three are collinear with the masses (in the rotating frame) and are unstable. The remaining two are located on the third vertex of both equilateral triangles of which the two bodies are the first and second vertices. = Four-body problem = Inspired by the circular restricted three-body problem, the four-body problem can be greatly simplified by considering a smaller body to have a small mass compared to the other three massive bodies, which in turn are approximated to describe circular orbits. This is known as the bicircular restricted four-body problem (also known as bicircular model) and it can be traced back to 1960 in a NASA report written by Su-Shu Huang. This formulation has been highly relevant in the astrodynamics, mainly to model spacecraft trajectories in the Earth-Moon system with the addition of the gravitational attraction of the Sun. The former formulation of the bicircular restricted four-body problem can be problematic when modelling other systems that not the Earth-Moon-Sun, so the formulation was generalized by Negri and Prado to expand the application range and improve the accuracy without loss of simplicity. = Planetary problem = The planetary problem is the -body problem in the case that one of the masses is much larger than all the others. A prototypical example of a planetary problem is the Sun‚ÄìJupiter‚ÄìSaturn system, where the mass of the Sun is about 100 times larger than the masses of Jupiter or Saturn. An approximate solution to the problem is to decompose it into pairs of star‚Äìplanet Kepler problems, treating interactions among the planets as perturbations. Perturbative approximation works well as long as there are no orbital resonances in the system, that is none of the ratios of unperturbed Kepler frequencies is a rational number. Resonances appear as small denominators in the expansion. The existence of resonances and small denominators led to the important question of stability in the planetary problem: do planets, in nearly circular orbits around a star, remain in stable or bounded orbits over time?Chierchia 2010 In 1963, Vladimir Arnold proved using KAM theory a kind of stability of the planetary problem: there exists a set of positive measure of quasiperiodic orbits in the case of the planetary problem restricted to the plane. In the KAM theory, chaotic planetary orbits would be bounded by quasiperiodic KAM tori. Arnold's result was extended to a more general theorem by F√©joz and Herman in 2004.F√©joz 2004 = Central configurations = A central configuration is an initial configuration such that if the particles were all released with zero velocity, they would all collapse toward the center of mass . Such a motion is called homothetic. Central configurations may also give rise to homographic motions in which all masses moves along Keplerian trajectories (elliptical, circular, parabolic, or hyperbolic), with all trajectories having the same eccentricity . For elliptical trajectories, corresponds to homothetic motion and gives a relative equilibrium motion in which the configuration remains an isometry of the initial configuration, as if the configuration was a rigid body.See Chierchia 2010 for animations illustrating homographic motions. Central configurations have played an important role in understanding the topology of invariant manifolds created by fixing the first integrals of a system. = -body choreography = Solutions in which all masses move on the same curve without collisions are called choreographies.Celletti 2008 A choreography for was discovered by Lagrange in 1772 in which three bodies are situated at the vertices of an equilateral triangle in the rotating frame. A figure eight choreography for was found numerically by C. Moore in 1993 and generalized and proven by A. Chenciner and R. Montgomery in 2000. Since then, many other choreographies have been found for .  Analytic approaches  For every solution of the problem, not only applying an isometry or a time shift but also a reversal of time (unlike in the case of friction) gives a solution as well. In the physical literature about the -body problem (), sometimes reference is made to the impossibility of solving the -body problem (via employing the above approach). However, care must be taken when discussing the 'impossibility' of a solution, as this refers only to the method of first integrals (compare the theorems by Abel and Galois about the impossibility of solving algebraic equations of degree five or higher by means of formulas only involving roots). = Power series solution = One way of solving the classical -body problem is \\"the -body problem by Taylor series\\". We start by defining the system of differential equations: :\\\\frac{d^2\\\\mathbf{x}_i(t)}{dt^2}=G \\\\sum_{k=1 \\\\atop k eq i}^n \\\\frac{m_k \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}_k(t)-\\\\mathbf{x}_i(t)\\\\right)}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{x}_k(t)-\\\\mathbf{x}_i(t)\\\\right^{3}}, As and are given as initial conditions, every is known. Differentiating results in which at which is also known, and the Taylor series is constructed iteratively. = A generalized Sundman global solution = In order to generalize Sundman's result for the case (or and ) one has to face two obstacles: #As has been shown by Siegel, collisions which involve more than two bodies cannot be regularized analytically, hence Sundman's regularization cannot be generalized. #The structure of singularities is more complicated in this case: other types of singularities may occur (see below). Lastly, Sundman's result was generalized to the case of bodies by Qiudong Wang in the 1990s. Since the structure of singularities is more complicated, Wang had to leave out completely the questions of singularities. The central point of his approach is to transform, in an appropriate manner, the equations to a new system, such that the interval of existence for the solutions of this new system is . = Singularities of the -body problem = There can be two types of singularities of the -body problem: *collisions of two or more bodies, but for which (the bodies' positions) remains finite. (In this mathematical sense, a \\"collision\\" means that two pointlike bodies have identical positions in space.) *singularities in which a collision does not occur, but does not remain finite. In this scenario, bodies diverge to infinity in a finite time, while at the same time tending towards zero separation (an imaginary collision occurs \\"at infinity\\"). The latter ones are called Painlev√©'s conjecture (no- collisions singularities). Their existence has been conjectured for by Painlev√© (see Painlev√© conjecture). Examples of this behavior for have been constructed by Xia and a heuristic model for by Gerver. Donald G. Saari has shown that for 4 or fewer bodies, the set of initial data giving rise to singularities has measure zero.  Simulation  While there are analytic solutions available for the classical (i.e. nonrelativistic) two-body problem and for selected configurations with , in general -body problems must be solved or simulated using numerical methods. = Few bodies = For a small number of bodies, an -body problem can be solved using direct methods, also called particle‚Äìparticle methods. These methods numerically integrate the differential equations of motion. Numerical integration for this problem can be a challenge for several reasons. First, the gravitational potential is singular; it goes to infinity as the distance between two particles goes to zero. The gravitational potential may be softened to remove the singularity at small distances: :U_\\\\varepsilon = \\\\sum_{1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n} \\\\frac{G m_i m_j}{\\\\sqrt{ \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q}_j - \\\\mathbf{q}_i\\\\right\\\\^2 + \\\\varepsilon^2 }}. Second, in general for , the -body problem is chaotic,Alligood 1996 which means that even small errors in integration may grow exponentially in time. Third, a simulation may be over large stretches of model time (e.g. millions of years) and numerical errors accumulate as integration time increases. There are a number of techniques to reduce errors in numerical integration. Local coordinate systems are used to deal with widely differing scales in some problems, for example an Earth‚ÄìMoon coordinate system in the context of a solar system simulation. Variational methods and perturbation theory can yield approximate analytic trajectories upon which the numerical integration can be a correction. The use of a symplectic integrator ensures that the simulation obeys Hamilton's equations to a high degree of accuracy and in particular that energy is conserved. = Many bodies = Direct methods using numerical integration require on the order of computations to evaluate the potential energy over all pairs of particles, and thus have a time complexity of . For simulations with many particles, the factor makes large-scale calculations especially time consuming. A number of approximate methods have been developed that reduce the time complexity relative to direct methods: * Tree code methods, such as a Barnes‚ÄìHut simulation, are collisionless methods used when close encounters among pairs are not important and distant particle contributions do not need to be computed to high accuracy. The potential of a distant group of particles is computed using a multipole expansion of the potential. This approximation allows for a reduction in complexity to . * Fast multipole methods take advantage of the fact that the multipole-expanded forces from distant particles are similar for particles close to each other. It is claimed that this further approximation reduces the complexity to . * Particle mesh methods divide up simulation space into a three dimensional grid onto which the mass density of the particles is interpolated. Then calculating the potential becomes a matter of solving a Poisson equation on the grid, which can be computed in time using fast Fourier transform techniques. Using adaptive mesh refinement or multigrid techniques can further reduce the complexity of the methods. *P3M and PM-tree methods are hybrid methods that use the particle mesh approximation for distant particles, but use more accurate methods for close particles (within a few grid intervals). P3M stands for particle‚Äìparticle, particle‚Äìmesh and uses direct methods with softened potentials at close range. PM-tree methods instead use tree codes at close range. As with particle mesh methods, adaptive meshes can increase computational efficiency. *Mean field methods approximate the system of particles with a time-dependent Boltzmann equation representing the mass density that is coupled to a self-consistent Poisson equation representing the potential. It is a type of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics approximation suitable for large systems. = Strong gravitation = In astrophysical systems with strong gravitational fields, such as those near the event horizon of a black hole, -body simulations must take into account general relativity; such simulations are the domain of numerical relativity. Numerically simulating the Einstein field equations is extremely challenging and a parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), such as the Einstein‚ÄìInfeld‚ÄìHoffmann equations, is used if possible. The two-body problem in general relativity is analytically solvable only for the Kepler problem, in which one mass is assumed to be much larger than the other.Blanchet 2001  Other -body problems  Most work done on the -body problem has been on the gravitational problem. But there exist other systems for which -body mathematics and simulation techniques have proven useful. In large scale electrostatics problems, such as the simulation of proteins and cellular assemblies in structural biology, the Coulomb potential has the same form as the gravitational potential, except that charges may be positive or negative, leading to repulsive as well as attractive forces.Krumscheid 2010 Fast Coulomb solvers are the electrostatic counterpart to fast multipole method simulators. These are often used with periodic boundary conditions on the region simulated and Ewald summation techniques are used to speed up computations.Board 1999 In statistics and machine learning, some models have loss functions of a form similar to that of the gravitational potential: a sum of kernel functions over all pairs of objects, where the kernel function depends on the distance between the objects in parameter space.Ram 2010 Example problems that fit into this form include all-nearest-neighbors in manifold learning, kernel density estimation, and kernel machines. Alternative optimizations to reduce the time complexity to have been developed, such as dual tree algorithms, that have applicability to the gravitational -body problem as well.

The Catostomidae are almost exclusively native to North America. The only exceptions are Catostomus catostomus, found in both North America and Russia, and Myxocyprinus asiaticus found only in China. In the Ozarks they are a common food fish and a festival is held each year to celebrate them. Ictiobus cyprinellus can reach an age up to 112 years, making it the oldest known freshwater teleost. Description and biology The mouth of this fish is located on the underside of its head (subterminal), with thick, fleshy lips. Most species are less than in length, but the largest species (Ictiobus and Myxocyprinus) can surpass . They are distinguished from related fish by having a long pharyngeal bone in the throat, containing a single row of teeth. Catostomids are most often found in rivers, but can be found in any freshwater environment. Their food ranges from detritus and bottom-dwelling organisms (such as crustaceans and worms), to surface insects, crayfish, small terrestrial vertebrates, and other fish. Fossil record Catostomidae have been uncovered and dated to the Middle Eocene in Colorado and Utah. An enormous gap (36.2 million years) in the fossil record occurs from the Late Eocene to Early Pleistocene.Paleobiology database. As food Northern hogsucker, Hypentelium nigricans They can be taken by many fishing methods, including angling and gigging. Often, species such as Catostomus commersonii and Hypentelium nigricans are preferred for eating. They can be canned, smoked, or fried, but small incisions often must be made in the flesh (termed \\"scoring\\") before frying to allow small internal bones to be palatable. Suckers were an important source of food for Indigenous Americans across the continent. Many fishing methods were employed with the most elaborate being stone fish traps constructed on spawning rivers, remnants of these traps can be seen today in Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park where the Achomawi people trapped Sacramento suckers. In the west these relationships became even more important after the decline in salmon runs due to damming and habitat destruction, some groups of native people relied on seasonal sucker runs for a significant amount of their food until the 1950s. In China there is a significant aquaculture industry dedicated to raising Myxocyprinus asiaticus for food.Lin, Y.; Y. Gong; Y. Yuan; S. Gong; D. Yu; Q. Li; and Z. Luo (2012).

The parish includes the central section of Etobicoke where two much earlier Catholic missions once served as the first Roman Catholic places of worship in Etobicoke.  History  ;Mission Churches As the Township of Etobicoke was first settled by British military families there were few Catholics in the municipality and the area was technically in the early Catholic Parish of St Patrick's, Dixie (near Toronto's present day airport) although early Catholic residents of southern Etobicoke found the early parish of St Helen's in Toronto's western suburb of Brockton more convenient. The Diocese of Toronto established, at different times in the late 19th century, two mission churches of St Patrick's, Dixie, in Etobicoke; St Joseph's and St Rita's. Both these early missions were on Dundas Street West in the centre of Etobicoke, an area now within the boundaries of Our Lady of Sorrows Parish.Our Lady of Sorrows Church : Etobicoke, Ontario : 50th anniversary 1940-1990 In the early 20th century, southern Etobicoke began to rapidly urbanise and new municipalities were formed out of Etobicoke which left the rest of the township a rural municipality centred on the Islington postal village at Dundas and Bloor. The first permanent Catholic parishes were founded in the independent Lakeshore municipalities of Mimico (St Leo's) and New Toronto (St Teresa's). ;Founding of the Parish Central Etobicoke was planned for development as a more exclusive residential neighbourhood than those that had separated from the township to the south, by Robert Home Smith, which eventually led to the creation of the first parish to remain in Etobicoke; Our Lady of Sorrows, in 1940.The Toronto Star 'NEW ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH SERVES GROWING KINGSWAY', Nov. 20, 1940 Pg 8 Founded during the Second World War, the first years of the parish were very active with parishioners organising to aid wartime charitiesThe Toronto Star 'GUILD OF OUR LADY OF SORROWS WILL AID WAR CHARITIES', Oct. 29, 1941 Pg 8 and the construction of Our Lady of Sorrows Elementary School, which opened in 1942http://www.tcdsb.org/ourladyofsorrows/Brief_History/index.html as Etobicoke's first permanent Catholic school which was quickly followed just to the west by the first Catholic high schools in the Township: St Joseph's Islington in 1949 (girls school run by the Sisters of St. Joseph) and Michael Power in 1947 (boys school run by the teaching Basilian Order of priests, named after Toronto's first catholic Bishop). For many years the pastor of Our Lady of Sorrows, Msgr, later Bishop Francis Allenhttp://www.archtoronto.org/archives/auxbishops/allen.htm worked in the parish, even after his espicopal ordination, concentrating on the need to establish catholic schools in the rapidly developing township. ;Recent Changes In 1967, the independent 'Lakeshore Municipalities' to the south, rejoined Etobicoke to form the Borough of Etobicoke, leaving St Leo's church as the oldest catholic church in the township. Our Lady of Sorrows Parish originally included much of Etobicoke to the north which only slowly separated into new parishes as Etobicoke urbanised and redevelopment of Dundas Street cut the area off from Our Lady of Sorrows parish. However, the parish continues to serve Catholics in The Kingsway and Islington; the neighbourhoods at the historic commercial and administrative centre of Etobicoke. In 1958 the Etobicoke municipal offices moved to the developing area around the new highway 427, the amalgamated Michael Power/St. Joseph High School following the move west in 1993 while to the south, the former Kingsmill Public Secondary School was reopened by the catholic school board as Bishop Allen Academy. The parish celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1990 by publishing a history which makes clear the central role the parish has played in the history of all Catholic communities in Etobicoke. The 50th anniversary of Our Lady of Sorrows Elementary School followed shortly after although tinged by controversy as the old school was replaced by a modern building which was completed in 2003. Our Lady of Sorrows Parish remains a strong presence in the heart of Etobicoke and has developed a strong musical tradition.  Pastors  *Rev. Gregory F. Kelly, 1940 ‚Äî 1952 *Most Rev.

Whilst some parts of the centre opened in 1981, Woolworths being the first on 23 November,Bexleyheath observer 26 November 1981 https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/540/32477541576_88d1e8c752_b.jpg the centre was opened in its current form by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on the thirteenth of March 1984 and underwent an extensive refurbishment in 2007. It had been due to form part of a wider regeneration of the surrounding area of Bexleyheath over the coming years, which would have seen additional retail amenity, Bexley Council offices, a library and residential development adjacent to the existing building.Bexley Council However, in 2010, following the sale of the centre, its new owners confirmed the major expansion plan would not be going ahead, though a small extension to the existing site remains a possibility. There are 59 retail shop units considered to be within the Mall building (including several premises where public access is from the Broadway itself)The Mall Bexleyheath floor plan from The Mall website (note some changes have been made since this map was produced) and additional smaller retailers in 'RMUs' (small, freestanding kiosk-like units). In the early years of the centre's existence, the site was known as the Broadway Shopping Centre; its owners included Norwich Union. In the early 21st century the building was acquired by the Mall Fund, becoming one of their network of centres under the generic \\"The Mall\\" branding. The Mall Fund subsequently purchased the neighbouring Broadway Square, and ran it alongside The Mall. In 2009, The Mall Fund's parent company Capital & Regional agreed a deal to sell the centre to Jones Lang LaSalle. As a result of its departure from the network, use of the Mall corporate material declined, though some elements (such as signage and branding) remained under The Mall identity, being replaced over a period of time. Other centres which have been sold off by The Mall Fund (such as The Ashley Centre) have reverted to their former names following their sale. Some marketing materials for the centre, as of Spring 2010, began to appear bearing the names 'Broadway' or 'Broadway Shopping Centre' in plain text. In September 2010, new signage bearing the name \\"Broadway Shopping Centre Bexleyheath\\", with the centre's new red-and-white logo, began replacing the Mall-branded elements. The full rebranding of the centre was timed to coincide with the opening of major new H&M; and New Look stores on the former Woolworths site. Following the sale of the centre, it was removed from The Mall's corporate website;The Mall Bexleyheath website removal notice initially, it did not have a dedicated website of its own as a replacement. However, JLL subsequently established one at broadwayshoppingcentre.com - with signs promoting this URL appearing in the centre from September 2010. In April 2016, Jones Lang LaSalle concluded the sale of the Bexleyheath complex to NewRiver Retail.  Information and location  The Mall is located in a rectangular building in the centre of Bexleyheath. The boundaries of the centre are the Broadway to the north, Townley Road to the west, Albion Road to the south and Norwich Place to the east. Norwich Place and the Broadway are now pedestrianised; the Broadway having been pedestrianised in 1993, and Norwich Place - partly closed off in the 1993 changes - was fully paved as part of the Broadway Square changes of 2001. Access to the malls is via pedestrian entrances at three sides of the mall (Broadway, Townley Road and Norwich Place), and vehicle access to the centre (for parking and deliveries) is via ramping at Albion Road. The centre is a four-storey building; public access to the retail stores is on the ground level; the first floor contains primarily 'service' (delivery bays), office space including the centre management suite, and the customer toilets; and the upper floors are car parking. There are two levels of parking - Upper and Lower - and each is divided into three sectors (East, West and Central), with associated lifts and stairs linking each sector to the mall level. Marks & Spencer, W H Smith and BHS have since opening offered some of their retail activity on the first floor, accessed via lifts/stairs/escalators within the relevant store; the 2010 H&M; and New Look stores, and the 2011 River Island store, introduced retail space on the first floor as part of the remodelling process to develop their retail space. Additionally, some stores have used internal mezzanine ceilings to create a 'false' upper level in their stores, though none are currently open using this format; the former HMV, Next and Waterstones (later JD Sports) stores did this, though the stores which replaced them do not - Select, Deichmann and EE having reverted these units to trading on a single retail level. The building encompasses three covered malls of shops which converge on a central square, and also includes a row of shops facing onto the Broadway itself (the shops between Marks & Spencer and Thomson (inclusive) are considered part of the Mall, though their postal addresses are given as being on the Broadway). The sloping nature of the land in the centre of Bexleyheath means that the Broadway entrance leads to a mall which is inclined until it meets the central square, and the Townley Road entrance is the only entrance of the three to be connected to the street level by steps/ramping.  History and design  The Mall opened in its current form in 1984, although outer sections fronting the Broadway opened earlier. Woolworths being the first, opening their new store at 93 - 105 Broadway on Monday 23 November 1981. The centre was built on a site previously largely occupied by Hides department store,\\"Changing Times - Shops\\", bexley.gov.uk, retrieved June 2012 the Lord Bexley Arms pub and neighbouring smaller buildings. The design of the new mall was a rectangular building facing onto Broadway, anchored by large stores at either end - Marks & Spencer at the eastern end and British Home Stores at the westernmost end - with accommodation around the centre for further large stores including a supermarket (Presto, later Safeway) and WH Smith and Woolworths all three of which opened both onto Broadway itself and into the new centre, and a large Boots store inside the mall, alongside smaller units providing capacity for around fifty further retail stores. The interior colour scheme of the mall, until the 2007 revamp, was in hues of brown, gold and cream, with marbled pillars, brown tiling in selected areas, cream and brown marble effect floor tiles and copper-coloured ceiling tiles and strips. The 2007 revamp altered this, most significantly in replacing the entire ceiling with a new white and grey one. The exterior of the building is principally brick, with dark brown roof tiles; a glazed white frontage was added to the main Broadway entrance area and the Townley Road entrance area as part of the 2007 alterations. In addition to the main retail units, small kiosks have featured within the centre to offer additional retail space within the malls; currently there are a number of kiosks in the 'RMU' format also used in a number of the Mall Fund's other centres. The inaugural winner of the Mall Fund's 'Make Your Mark' competition for new retailers was 'Daisy's Dog Deli', a pet food RMU based at The Mall, Bexleyheath. This firm has since relocated to trade from a kiosk at the Bluewater regional shopping mall.  Developments and redevelopments  = Broadway Square = In 2001, a new shopping development adjacent to the Mall was opened, having been under development for some time. Broadway Square uses a 'strip mall' format to offer a pub and six large retail units, with an associated two-level (basement and ground) car park. Broadway Square was initially independent of the neighbouring covered centre, until it was subsequently acquired by The Mall Fund and run in conjunction with the main Mall. Retailers currently trading from Broadway Square (as at June 2012) are TK Maxx, JD Sports, Poundland, Poundworld/DiscountUK, Wilko and Sainsbury's, along with The Furze Wren (a J D Wetherspoon pub). It was not initially clear whether the sale of the Mall to JLL also included Broadway Square, as the two buildings retained their separate identities under Mall Fund ownership, but new centre maps installed by JLL in September 2010 included the Square stores as well as the main centre, suggesting the whole site had indeed been sold. = 2007 revamp = In late 2006 work began on a major refurbishment of the Mall. The lavatory facilities were revamped, and as part of this the men's toilet was relocated, with the previous men's room becoming a baby changing and feeding area. The mall level was also revamped, with the copper ceiling strips and tiles, which had been in place since the centre's opening, removed, and replaced by a new white and grey ceiling. Several new skylights were also cut into the roof of the centre to allow more natural light in - due to the design of the building, with the mall level at the bottom of a four-storey development, access to natural light had been limited prior to the changes. There were also new glazed entrances developed at two of the three pedestrian entrances. The revamp also allowed space for Mall TV displays (monitors broadcasting a loop of information and promotional material) and advertising hoardings. Some of The Mall branded elements introduced in the revamp remained in the centre briefly following the sale to JLL but have now largely been replaced. = Previous developments of major stores = Due to the location and design of the building, historically bounded by roadways on all four sides (albeit with two of these later pedestrianised), it has not been possible to extend or materially alter the Mall. However, there have been a small number of changes to the configuration of units in the centre, which have made a limited number of new units available. Two of these changes involved the division of the centre's original Woolworths store. When the centre opened in 1984, a large Woolworths was located at the eastern side of the centre close to Marks & Spencer. In 1990 this was cut in half, creating three new units - one which was initially occupied by Miss Selfridge, then by HMV from 1994 to 2013, and then by fashion retailer Select from 2014; one for Superdrug, which was at the time under common ownership with Woolworths; and one for Argos facing onto Broadway. The remainder continued as a smaller Woolworths. In 2000, Woolworths moved to the former Safeway unit on the western side of the centre (near to W H Smith), where they would remain until the UK Woolworths chain collapsed in 2008: this move saw the vacated smaller Woolworths divided again; this allowed Superdrug and Argos to extend to their current sizes, and also allowed the development of three new shop units, taken up by GAME, Phones4U and Sussex Stationers. Former office space above Woolworths was let to Reed, with public access to this space created by converting a former Woolworths fire exit. Following the move of Reed out of the centre and the collapse of Phones4U, these areas were pulled together, with the removal of the staircase at the former Reed entrance, in 2015 to form a single store for Footasylum. Following the closure of Woolworths at the end of 2008, its later (ex-Safeway) premises were extensively remodelled and divided into two new retail units. Posters were subsequently applied to the hoardings which confirmed New Look would be taking up a portion of the redeveloped space, relocating from their smaller existing store in the centre; subsequently, a strap appeared on another section of the hoarding confirming an H&M; store would be occupying that section of the space from September: this would be H&M;'s first presence in Bexleyheath. The New Look store opened in late August 2010, followed by the H&M; in early September. The relocation of New Look in turn allowed their former premises to be relet to The Entertainer. The only other major store to have changed its configuration since the mall opened was Boots, which expanded to its current size in 2001 by taking over a vacant single store (formerly occupied by Instep Sports) neighbouring their original unit. Deichmann opened in a double-fronted store by joining the former Next premises within the mall to the neighbouring former Sussex Stationers store (which had prior to 2000 been part of Woolworths). Morleys Stores opened a 50,000sq ft department store in the centre in spring 2017, taking the space vacated by the collapse of British Home Stores. In 2018 construction work began to install a gym above Morley's, this will be operated by The Gym Group and open in winter 2018-19. = Forthcoming and proposed developments = The Mall Company backed a scheme as part of a proposed redevelopment of Bexleyheath town centre. The scheme would have seen Bexley Magistrates' Court, which currently neighbours the Mall on its south-eastern side, moved to the current Central Library site, and the Broadway Square car park replaced by a new parking facility on part of the current Civic Offices site. The existing Magistrates' Court, Broadway Square car park and the remainder of the Civic Offices site would then have been redeveloped with two levels of retail stores (linked into the existing Mall at ground level), with new council offices, a new library and a series of residential blocks located above this. This development was approved by Bexley Council in 2009 and was expected to be developed between 2010 and 2012.The Mall's redevelopment plans on Bexley Council's website (pdf) The plans were submitted to the council by Capital & Regional (as The Mall Fund) prior to the sale of The Mall to JLL; it was not immediately clear what effect the sale would have on the redevelopment plans, or if JLL would take over the project in its existing form. In 2010 it was confirmed that the large-scale redevelopment proposed by C&R; would not be going ahead: the library and magistrates' court would remain in their existing locations, with the council selling the civic offices site to a large food store (as had been proposed by construction firm John Laing in the rival bid for the original development plan). JLL may redevelop and extend their mall site in a smaller way, most likely by extending the building onto the Broadway Square car park which neighbours the existing building. Bexley Council subsequently came to an agreement with Tesco, which had earlier bought the former Woolwich Building Society offices on Erith Road and had planned a supermarket for the site; under this deal, the Civic Offices would transfer their operations to the former Woolwich site, with the current Civic Offices to be replaced with a Tesco store. The relocation of Civic Offices functions to the former WBS building and the demolition of the prior offices went ahead as planned, but Tesco subsequently included the Bexleyheath site among a list of over 40 new stores which would now not be going ahead; the future use of the former Civic Offices site is now unclear. Metro Bank has applied to Bexley Council for permission to convert units at the Broadway entrance of the mall to create a new bank branch, likely to open in 2016;Cushman & Wakefield to enable this development to go ahead, in late 2015 the stores then trading in the affected units - Carphone Warehouse, Thomas Cook and Sblended Milkshakes - were relocated to alternative spaces within the building, with Sblended moving to an in-mall kiosk and the others taking then-vacant units.  Stores  Below are just a few of the many stores trading within the buildings, as of 2016; Ann Summers, Argos, Boots, Card Factory, Clarks, GAME, Greggs, H&M;, Marks & Spencer, New Look, Superdrug, W H Smith  Former retailers  Retailers which have formerly traded at the Broadway Shopping Centre but no longer do so include Dixons, Topshop and Topman, HMV, Miss Selfridge, Woolworths, Safeway, Rosebys, Radio Rentals, Our Price, Dolcis, JJB Sports, Waterstone's, The Link, Rumbelows, Krisp, Principles, Bay Trading Company, Next, and Birthdays/Pure Party. Some of these firms are still trading elsewhere in the country, though others are now defunct or dormant: see the retailers' pages for more detailed information about each firm. JD Sports traded inside the mall for a time (in what is now T-Mobile) after their merger with First Sport, which previously occupied the unit, but subsequently closed this small store to focus on their larger and more recent Broadway Square site. Mothercare and Early Learning Centre were located in separate stores inside the shopping centre for a number of years, but relocated in September 2010 to a former Aldi store on Market Place, outside the centre's boundaries. (In 2018, this store was included on a list of sixty Mothercare stores earmarked for closure as part of the retailer's restructuring plan; as at August 2018 it remains open and trading.) The Greenwich & Bexley Community Hospice (formerly Cottage Hospice) charity operated a retail store at various store locations within the mall building from 2009, generally taking short-term lets of then-vacant units and relocating as and when required to release stores for new regular tenants. The hospice's final store location within the building during this run closed in June 2011 and was not replaced; the hospice's other charity shops elsewhere continued to trade as normal. A new Hospice charity shop opened (in the former Hype store) in November 2011, moving to the former Pure Party premises in 2012, and this store closed in early 2013. Peacocks traded from Broadway Square from the unit's opening in 2001 until the firm's collapse in 2012; it was not one of the stores rescued by Edinburgh Woollen Mill. In its later years Peacocks had operated a Bonmarche concession on its upper level; this too has closed. In May 2012, Poundworld took over the Peacocks premises, installing its own sister firm DiscountUK in the former Bonmarche space. (This store closed in summer 2018 along with all other Poundworld stores, its future use unclear.) In spring 2015, Peacocks included the former (pre-2011) River Island premises within the main centre on its list of new and forthcoming stores; when opened, the new Peacocks in fact combined the ex-River Island site with the neighbouring former Harris's. Local ladieswear boutique Honeybee closed in 2012 having been located in the same position in the centre for over 25 years. Its place was taken by Gosh relocating from its previous site. As of 2018 this store is occupied by Smiggle, who carried out the most thorough refurbishment of the space undertaken since the Honeybee era. Footwear retailer Harris's took up the former ELC store inside the mall in December 2010, then moved to the former La Senza store site on the Broadway, outside the centre's boundaries, in 2013. The former ELC/Harris's store is now absorbed as part of the 2015 Peacocks store.

It was founded on a riverside site by Anglo-Saxons at the start of the 10th century, possibly on the site of a 5th-century predecessor. Some Saxon- era structural elements remain despite 12th-century additions made when Shoreham became prosperous, further extension in the 14th century and a Victorian restoration. The cruciform structure, with its solid central tower, features some unusual Norman-era carving. English Heritage has listed it at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance. History According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, √Ülle, an Anglo-Saxon bretwalda (overlord), came ashore at a place called Cymenes ora on the English Channel coast in 477. He defeated the native inhabitants and became the first king of the South Saxons. The location of the landing place is not known for certain, and historic claims that it was near Shoreham are now considered unlikely, but a church may have been founded inland next to the River Adur in 481. Later in the Saxon era, a large church was definitely built on the site. It had a prominent tower and was more than long. Most sources date its construction to 900 or slightly earlier. William de Braose, a Norman nobleman who participated in the Norman conquest of England, was awarded large areas of land in Sussex, including the Rape of Bramber, in 1073. This area included the Saxon church and its surrounding village, which at the time was mostly agricultural (although prosperous, as indicated by the size of the church). In about 1080, he granted the advowson to an abbey in the French town of Saumur which was linked to a locally important priory in Sele (near modern-day Upper Beeding), further up the River Adur. Sele Priory became the church's patron in its own right in the early 13th century; it then passed into the control of Magdalen College, Oxford before being transferred to the Bishop of Chichester in 1948. The church was significantly altered in about 1140, but parts of the Saxon structure were retained: the west and north walls of the nave are distinguished from the Norman-era work by their thickness, and there is a blocked doorway. Otherwise, the nave was rebuilt, the old tower was removed and a new central tower replaced it, north and south transepts were added (each incorporating a chapel), and a chancel and apse were built at the east end. The main entrance moved to the south transept, where an ornate doorway was provided. The tower was provided with a substantial crossing and arches with carvings of bizarre faces: these include King Stephen (the monarch at the time) and his wife Matilda, a cat, an elf and another human figure, conjectured to be the stonemason responsible for the carvings. All of these characters have \\"sad or angry expressions\\"; other faces elsewhere are said to have an \\"elongated, very French look\\". The chancel was altered again in the 14th century: it was given a tie-beamed roof, and was extended to form two bays and its apsidal east end was replaced with a straight wall with a new window. The chapel in the north transept was also extended at this time, and a trefoil-headed rood screen was installed. This survives, although not in its original condition. The next significant work was carried out between 1839 and 1840 by John Mason Neale who opened out the interior, rebuilt the transepts (the north transept and its chapel, in particular, were ruinous at that time) and added a new arch, built vestries and replaced most of the windows. At the same time J.C. Buckler restored the chancel. The changes gave the church a more Norman appearance than it originally had, according to Ian Nairn. Benjamin Ingelow made further changes in 1895‚Äì96. Architecture crossing towards the altar St Nicolas Church is a large cruciform building with a central tower. This is a common plan in Sussex: central towers are often seen, and the cruciform layout (nave to the west, chancel to the east and transepts to the north and south) is commoner than the linear alternative without transepts. The main building material is flint rubble-work; some walls have stone dressings. These are the most common structural materials used for ancient churches in Sussex. The roof is tiled with slabs of Horsham stone‚Äî another common feature in the area. The nave is of three bays, and incorporates flintwork from the original 10th-century church, a blocked Saxon doorway on the north side and another on the south side dating from the 12th- century reconstruction. The two-bay chancel is in the Early English style; its east window has an example of reticulated (grid-pattern) tracery. The Norman tower has three arches on each face‚Äîthe central one open and slightly larger, flanked by two closed arches‚Äîbelow paired oeils-de-boeuf. Inside, the large crossing and tower arches dominate. Each arch features well-preserved Norman carving, as do the arches of the transepts: as well as the royal figures, the cat and the elf, there are other human faces, shells, rosettes and chevron patterns. The church today St Nicolas Church was listed at Grade I by English Heritage on 8 May 1950. Such buildings are defined as being of \\"exceptional interest\\" and greater than national importance. As of February 2001, it was one of seven Grade I listed buildings, and 119 listed buildings of all grades, in Adur district. The parish of St Nicolas, which covers nearly , is smaller now than when it was established. St Mary de Haura Church, founded in the 11th century when the new Port of Shoreham was established on the English Channel coast, was part of the parish until about 1250, when it gained independence and its own parish. In the 20th century, land was taken from the east of the parish to form a new parish for St Giles' Church, newly built in neighbouring Kingston by Sea. The western boundary of the present-day parish is formed by the River Adur, and the northern boundary cuts across the lower slopes of the South Downs; Parkside, Eastern Avenue, Ham Road and Mill Lane form the urban boundaries.

The law relating to indictments evolved during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and became lengthy, confusing and highly technical to the point where some barristers specialised entirely in drawing up indictments. During the nineteenth century several Acts were passed by Parliament to correct this problem, but none were entirely successful. In 1913 Lord Haldane created a committee to draw up a draft bill reforming the law of indictments, which became the Indictments Act 1915. Coming into force on 1 April 1916, the Act established rules on how indictments are to be drafted, and provided methods to amend and alter faulty indictments in court. Most importantly it simplified the layout of indictments and provided a list of items it had to contain, such as \\"such particulars as may be necessary for giving reasonable information as to the nature of the charge.\\" While the Act has been significantly amended over the years, several sections are still in force, and the indictment rules given form the basis of the Indictment Rules 1971 (S.I. 1971/1253) which replace the Indictment Rules 1915 (S.R. & O. 1915/1235). Background An indictment is a document formally accusing an individual of a criminal offence.Alexander (1916) p.236 Indictments have been used in English law from at least 1362,Alexander (1916) p.237 but the system was mainly developed during the seventeenth and eighteenth century. During this period indictments became lengthy, confusing and highly technical, firstly because of the large number of new criminal offences created and secondly because of the back-and-forth between counsel for the defence and the prosecution, one attempting to spot loopholes in the indictment and the other attempting to close them.Alexander (1916) p.238 A slight misspelling on the indictment rendered it invalid, and all errors were taken in favour of the prisoner.Winfield (2007) p.51 An additional contributory factor was that the indictments were drafted by clerks of assize who were only paid once per set of indictments ‚Äì if the indictment was not valid they had to write a new one for free, and they therefore had a vested interest in making them as detailed and complex as possible to avoid subtle flaws. By the turn of the 20th century indictments were so complex that some barristers such as Archibald Bodkin had a practice specialising in writing them. The 19th century saw significant changes made to English criminal law in an attempt to simplify and modernise it, and Acts of Parliament reforming the law surrounding indictments were passed in 1826, 1828, 1848, 1849 and 1851. Only the Criminal Procedure Act 1851 dealt with indictments directly ‚Äì the others simply amended the law around it ‚Äì but it was not an unqualified success. J.F. Stephen wrote \\"In 1851 an Act was passed which went further in the way of removing technicalities but it did so by an enumeration of them so technical and minute that no one could possibly understand it who had not first acquainted himself with the technicalities which it was meant to abolish\\". The Act did get rid of the idea that minor flaws in an indictment sunk it entirely, and Stephen later wrote that \\"a general impression has been produced that quibbles about indictments have come to an end\\".Alexander (1916) p.240 Nothing else was done to reform the law relating to indictments until the early 20th century. In 1913 Lord Haldane created a committee led by Mr Justice Avory to draft a bill reforming the law of indictments.Alexander (1916) p.241 The draft bill was finished and introduced to Parliament by 1915, and it was given the Royal Assent on 23 December 1915, coming into force on 1 April 1916 as the Indictments Act 1915. Omissions Despite being the first Act to amend the law relating to indictments in over 50 years, it at no point formally defines what an indictment is. Section 1 - Rules as to indictments Section 1 of the Act provides: The words \\"by the rule committee\\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/5-6/90/section/1/enacted were repealed by section 19(4)(b) of the Criminal Justice Administration Act 1956. The First Schedule to the Act was repealed by rule 2 of the Indictment Rules 1971. The original format also allows the rules to be changed by the Rules Committee, something removed when the Act was amended by the Criminal Justice Administration Act 1956.Criminal Justice Administration Act 1956 s.19(4)b The original rules remained in force until 1971, when they were significantly reformed as the Indictment Rules 1971. Section 2 - Powers of rule committee This section created a rule committee made up of the Lord Chief Justice, a judge of the High Court of Justice, a Clerk of the Peace, a Clerk of Assize, a Chairman of the Quarter Sessions, a Recorder and \\"another person having experience in criminal procedure\\".Indictments Act 1915 s.2(1) The committee had the power to suggest changes to the rules governing indictments, which would be placed before Parliament for forty days and passed as a Statutory Instrument if no objections were raised.Indictments Act 1915 s.2(3) This was a more powerful version of the rules committee established by the Poor Prisoners' Defence Act 1903.Alexander (1916) p.242 This section was repealed by the Criminal Justice Administration Act 1956 and the Courts Act 1971, and the rules are now amended by the Crown Court Rule Committee. Section 3 - General provisions as to indictments This section lays out what an indictment is required to contain. It must include a statement of the offence the defendant is being charged with \\"together with such particulars as may be necessary for giving reasonable information as to the nature of the charge.\\"Indictments Act 1915 s.3 The second part of this caused problems, because prosecution barristers would give the smallest amount of information possible to make the defence counsel's job more difficult. This was a significant problem, particularly in complex fraud cases where by the 1960s it was normal for the defence attorney to receive several thousand pages of witness statements, documents and pieces of evidence with only a vague, general indictment tying them together. Section 4 - Joinder of charges in the same indictment This section allowed an indictment for both felonies and misdemeanors at once, but gave the defendant the right to treat both as if they were felonies and allowed him to challenge the jurors.Indictments Act 1915 s.4 This was amended by the Criminal Law Act 1967 to remove the right to challenge jurors (and felonies were abolished).Criminal Law Act 1967 (c. 58), section 1 and Sch. 3 Pt. III Section 5 - Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial This section allows the court to amend an indictment at any point before trial, unless to do so would cause an \\"injustice\\".Indictments Act 1915 s.5(1) It also allows them to postpone a trial for the purpose of amending the indictment and separate felonies and misdemeanors into different indictments.Indictments Act 1915 s.5 Section 6 - Costs of defective or redundant indictments This section allowed the court to award costs to the prosecution for defective or unnecessarily lengthy indictments. It was repealed by section 31(6) of, and Schedule 2 to, the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/5-6/90/section/6 Section 7 - Saving This section formerly provided that nothing in the Act prevents the challenge of an indictment if it fails to comply with the Vexatious Indictments Act 1859. This was amended by the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933, and the section now provides that nothing in the Act prevents a challenge if the indictment fails to comply with \\"any other enactment\\".Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933 (c. 36), Sch. 3 Section 8 - Savings and interpretation This section provides that similarly the Act does not intend to alter the jurisdiction of courts or places where an individual can be tried, and that the Act applies to all appeals against indictments.The Indictments Act 1915, section 8 Section 9 - Repeal, extent, short title and commencement This section provides that the Act does not apply in Scotland or Northern Ireland, and that it came into force on 1 April 1916. It also amends and repeals several other bits of legislation with the Second Schedule, including some of the Quarter Sessions Act 1849.Indictments Act 1915, section 9 This schedule was itself repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1927. First Schedule This Schedule contained rules relating to indictments, which could be cited as the Indictment rules 1915. It was repealed by rule 2 of the Indictment Rules 1971. The rules created by this Schedule are replaced by new rules under that instrument. The rules set out the form an indictment was meant to take.Birks (1995) p.61Indictments Act 1915 sch.1 Rule 1(2) provided that each sheet on which an indictment was set out was to be not more than 12 and not less than 6 inches in length, and not more that 14 and not less than 12 inches in width, and that if more than one sheet was required, that the sheets were to be fastened together in book form. The Appendix to the Rules, as enacted, contained specimen forms of indictment for a number of offences: *Form 1 - Murder *Form 2 - Accessory after the fact to murder *Form 3 - Manslaughter *Form 4 - Rape *Form 5 Count 1 - Wounding with intent, contrary to section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 Count 2 - Wounding, contrary to section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 *Form 6 - Cruelty to a child, contrary to section 12 of the Children Act 1908 *Form 7 - Larceny, contrary to section 67 of the Larceny Act 1861 *Form 8 - Robbery with violence, contrary to section 42 of the Larceny Act 1861 *Form 9 Count 1 - Larceny after a previous conviction Count 2 - Receiving stolen goods, contrary to section 91 of the Larceny Act 1861 *Form 10 - Burglary and larceny, contrary to section 60 of the Larceny Act 1861 *Form 11 - Sending threatening letter, contrary to section 46 of the Larceny Act 1861 *Form 12 - Obtaining goods by false pretences, contrary to section 88 of the Larceny Act 1861 *Form 13 - Conspiracy to defraud *Form 14 Count 1 - Arson, contrary to section 2 of the Malicious Damage Act 1861 Count 2 - Arson, contrary to section 3 of the Malicious Damage Act 1861 *Form 15 - A.B., arson, contrary to section 3 of the Malicious Damage Act 1861; C.D., accessory before the fact to same offence *Form 16 Count 1 - Offence under section 35 of the Malicious Damage Act 1861 Count 2 - Obstructing railway, contrary to section 36 of the Malicious Damage Act 1861. *Form 17 Damaging trees, contrary to section 22 of the Malicious Damage Act 1861 *Form 18 Count 1 - Forgery, contrary to section 2(1)(a) of the Forgery Act 1913 Count 2 - Uttering forged document, contrary to section 6(1)(2) of the Forgery Act 1913 *Form 19 - Uttering counterfeit coin, contrary to section 9 of the Coinage Offences Act 1861 *Form 20 - Uttering counterfeit coin, contrary to section 12 of the Coinage Offences Act 1861 *Form 21 - Perjury, contrary to section (1)(i) of the Perjury Act 1911 *Form 22 - Libel (i.e. defamatory libel) *Form 23 Count 1 - Publishing obscene libel Count 2 - Procuring obscene libel [or thing] with intent to sell or publish *Form 24 - A.B., undischarged bankrupt, obtaining credit, contrary to section 155 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914; C.D., being accessory to same offence *Form 25 - Counts 1 and 2:Falsification of accounts, contrary to section 1 of the Falsification of Accounts Act 1875 *Form 26 Count 1 - Fraudulent conversion of property, contrary to section 1(1)(a) of the Larceny Act 1901 Count 2 - Fraudulent conversion of property, contrary to section 1(1)(b) of the Larceny Act 1901 By rule 4(5), the forms set out in the appendix to the rules or forms conforming thereto as nearly as may be had to be used in cases to which they were applicable, and in other cases forms to the like effect or conforming thereto as nearly as may be had to be used, the statement of offence and the particulars of offence being varied according to the circumstances in each case.

Born and educated in Liverpool, Pappworth graduated as a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1932 from Liverpool University. After working in a series of junior medical positions, his applications for more senior posts were rejected because of his Jewish parentage. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Having been unsuccessful in achieving a post in any well known London hospital after the war, he set up in London as an independent medical consultant and tutor. Pappworth's teaching of postgraduate students had a profound effect on the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) examination pass rate, and his contact with junior doctors led him to investigate the ethics of medical research on humans. The publication of Human Guinea Pigs, which examined unethical medical research practices, exposed the subject to a wider audience and led to Pappworth's becoming persona non grata within the medical establishment for much of his career, but ultimately helped lead to stricter codes of practice for human experimentation . Early life and education Born Maurice Henry Papperovitch on 9 January 1910, Pappworth was the seventh child in a family that included three sons and six daughters. He graduated from Liverpool University's medical school in 1932 as Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery, after previously studying at the Birkenhead Institute. In 1936, he received his medical doctorate and passed the MRCP exam, after which he worked in several Liverpool hospitals in junior roles‚Äîincluding as a registrar under Henry Cohen. Before the Second World War, Pappworth sought a medical consultant role only to suffer from anti-Semitic discrimination, being told that \\"no Jew could ever be a gentleman\\" when he applied for a post in 1939. That position eventually went to a student whom he had coached for the MRCP exam. From 1941 to 1946, he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel and serving in Africa, Italy, Greece and finally India, where he ran a British general hospital. In 1946, Pappworth moved to London, where his applications for prominent medical positions were rejected. He turned down several lesser posts before setting up as an independent consultant. In 1953, he married Jean Goldberg; the couple went on to have three daughters. Postgraduate teaching In the 1950s, the pass rate for the MRCP examination seldom topped fifteen percent, partly due to the medical establishment's need to restrict the number of applicants to senior positions, but also‚ÄîPappworth maintained‚Äîbecause of low teaching standards in medical schools. Almost no preparation for the MRCP exam was given to postgraduates, so Pappworth resolved to tutor qualified doctors in the particulars of medicine and patient examination that the exam required. Charging one pound‚Äîthen not inconsiderable‚Äîfor a two-hour class, Pappworth began teaching in his consulting rooms, later moving the classes to a public hall in London. He also staged mock examinations in nearby mental hospitals for a higher cost. The pass rate for Pappworth's students was \\"outstandingly good\\"; sometimes more than half of those who passed the exam had been taught by him. Over the course of his career, Pappworth tutored more than 1,600 doctors, many of whom were from overseas. He claimed that 75 percent of the successful New Zealand and Australian candidates could trace their success to his teaching. Many working consultants in the United Kingdom admit Pappworth's influence on the success of their careers. While recognized as the best medical teacher in the country, Pappworth was unafraid of speaking his mind about the medical establishment; equally, the Royal College of Physicians did not withhold criticism of Pappworth's unwanted encroachment into its affairs. In 1960, Pappworth's lectures were published as A Primer of Medicine. It ran to three editions, but lacked the comprehensive and incisive nature of his spoken lectures. He is credited with coining the term \\"diagnostic greed\\"; ‚Äúoverwhelming evidence is not essential for correct diagnosis, and the absence of some expected symptom or sign often does not invalidate an otherwise reasonable diagnosis.‚Äù Human Guinea Pigs In the 1950s and 1960s, Pappworth became concerned by descriptions in medical journals of unethical experiments on human subjects in the United Kingdom and United States; his growing awareness of the issue was reinforced by the concerns of his postgraduate students, who sometimes had no choice but to facilitate and participate in such experiments or face career ruin. The experiments went against the principles set out in the Nuremberg Code, so Pappworth began writing letters to medical journals that had presented the research. Many of these went unprinted, so in 1962 he published fourteen of the letters as Human Guinea Pigs: A Warning in a special edition of Twentieth Century magazine. Pappworth made plans to publish an extended version of his article as a book. Human Guinea Pigs: Experimentation on Man named those responsible for the research and fully cited its sources. It detailed experiments on children and inmates of mental and penal institutions, and included 78 examples of research that had been carried out on patients who were at National Health Service hospitals for routine surgery. Some of these patients had been subjected to cardiac catheterisation‚Äîthe insertion of a catheter into a chamber or vessel of the heart‚Äîwithout informed consent. Pappworth believed the reasons for the experiments to be purely for the career advancement of those involved. Pappworth was advised by the medical establishment to keep quiet on the issue, but he refused. The first publishers he approached declined the book on legal grounds, but Human Guinea Pigs was eventually published in 1967 by Routledge and Kegan Paul. The book's publication provoked an immediate storm; newspaper and television coverage of the issue followed, as well as questions in Parliament. Pappworth's American contemporary Henry K. Beecher, with whom Pappworth had corresponded before and after Human Guinea Pigs publication, had published similar findings in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1966, but had not named those involved. Despite official disinterest and professional impedance, Pappworth's and Beecher's work eventually led to the introduction of stricter codes of practice for human experimentation and the establishment of research ethics committees, which would have come much later had it not been for their expos√©s. Later career and personal life It has been suggested that the unintended consequence of this exposure was Pappworth's becoming persona non grata within the medical establishment. His critical nature may have been partly to blame for this, as he not only continued to admonish Royal College of Physicians, but also alienated some of those in the medical establishment that were sympathetic to his cause; Pappworth's personal comments about specific consultants quickly distanced his audience when he was invited to speak to the residents at Hammersmith Hospital, whose medical school he had criticised in Human Guinea Pigs for its unethical methods. Pappworth's attitude towards students could also leave them feeling \\"ignorant, foolish, and humiliated\\". Towards the end of his life, he wrote an article in the British Medical Journal that included his view that \\"those who dirty the linen and not those who wash it should be criticised. Some do not wash linen in public or in private and the dirt is merely left to accumulate until it stinks\\". Pappworth continued to be disregarded by the medical establishment. For example, election to a fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians is usually a formality awarded after passing the MRCP‚Äîwhich Pappworth did in 1936‚Äîand after being in practice for ten to fifteen years. He was not awarded a fellowship until 1993, when changes in the corridors of power made this possible. Pappworth's interests outside medicine included photography, fine art and watercolours, philosophy, religion, and politics. He died on 12 October 1994 of coronary heart disease at his London home; he was survived by his wife and three daughters. Publications *A Primer of Medicine.

It follows on from the previous Federal government's Northern Territory National Emergency Response. The A$647 million program proposes to construct over 750 houses and refurbish another 2,500 houses in 73 communities across the Northern Territory, as well as providing essential urban infrastructure to support the new houses. Major capital works are proposed in 16 communities, pending the establishment of long-term leases. A key focus of the program is the aim to provide jobs and training opportunities for Indigenous Australians. The Federal Government announced in May 2009 that work under the program had started in three locations, Groote Eylandt, the Tiwi Islands and Tennant Creek. The government has announced that at least 20 per cent of the local workforce will be indigenous, with the aim of creating longer-term employment outcomes for communities. Work at Tennant Creek includes providing electricity, water, sewerage and roads to the town camps. The program has been criticised by indigenous leaders such as Alison Anderson and Galarrwuy Yunupingu for what they claim is excessive bureaucracy and overheads. Yunupingu said in August 2009 \\"I keep hearing that, two years on, not one house has been built and I see it, too. Not one house. I keep getting the complaint that all the companies are doing is consulting and consulting, getting their daily fees and disappearing again.\\", adding \\"It's a system designed to profit non-Aborigines while nothing gets done.\\" The local federal member of parliament, Damian Hale had earlier defended the program, citing the remoteness of the areas where the houses are proposed to be built. Hale commented that \\"It will not be fixed in 20 months but what we can fix is have the land lease arrangements in place properly, the alliances are put in place\\" and stated that \\"[W]e're not building in Sydney or Melbourne, we're building in remote parts of Australia.\\" A briefing to Anderson, a Northern Territory parliamentarian, by the administrator of the program, was said to have indicated that as few as 300 houses may be built; this briefing was later described as \\"inaccurate\\". Anderson challenged the administration charge claimed by the Territory governmentinitially $100 million, 15 per cent of the project budgetclaiming it was excessive, and was successful in pushing for cost savings of $50 million. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Paul Henderson, has pledged that the program would construct the 750 houses, with construction of 55 new homes to be underway by the end of 2010.

Springer, New York, New York. 428 pp. A classic, well-documented example of a roof pendant is the strata that comprise Mount Morrison within the Sierra Nevada in Mono and Fresno counties, California. It lies midway between Mono Lake on the north and Bishop, California, on the south. Mount Morrison consists of a roof pendant that underlies an area of . This roof pendant consists of a 15,000 m- (50,000 ft-) thick sequence of complexly folded and faulted metasedimentary strata and metavolcanic strata. The eastern two-thirds of this roof pendant consists of Cambrian to Silurian and Pennsylvanian to Permian metasedimentary strata. Metavolcanic rocks of Mesozoic age comprise the western third of the roof pendant. Mesozoic granitic rocks enclose and intrude the pendant rocks. These granitic rocks consist predominantly of quartz monzonite and granodiorite with local, minor, scattered bodies of granite, aplite, diorite and gabbro. These pendants are part of a discontinuous, -long, northwest-trending belt of roof pendants that are preserved within the granitic plutons of Sierra Nevada.Greene, DC, and CH Stevens (1999) Stratigraphy, depositional history, and tectonic evolution of Paleozoic continental-margin rocks in roof pendants of the eastern Sierra Nevada, California.

Design  Lap√©rouse was built at Brest, France. She was laid down in 1875 and launched in 1877. Her main armament was mounted in barbettes. The unarmoured cruisers of the Lap√©rouse class were wooden-hulled ships with iron beams. These ships had plough bows with a forecastle, a displacement of 2,363 tons, a speed of 15 knots and had a complement of 264 sailors. Armament was fifteen M1870M guns later replaced in Primauget with Quick Firing Conversions. Each ship also had eight 1-pounder revolving cannons.  Career  Lap√©rouse was part of the Far East Squadron under Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet. On 31 July 1898, she was anchored in Fort-Dauphin's Bay at Anosy, Madagascar, waiting for coal for a voyage in which she was to provide transport for the Governor of Madagascar, General Joseph Gallieni, when a storm hit. A sudden gust of wind broke her two anchor chains, and she drifted toward the coast, ran aground, and was wrecked. All hands were saved.

The name was invented in 2003 by G. Assanto. and used thereafter Nematicons are generated by a special type of optical nonlinearity present in NLC: the light induced reorientation of the molecular director (i.e. the average molecular orientation). This nonlinearity arises from the fact that the molecular director (i.e., the optic axis of the corresponding uniaxial) tends to align along the electric field of light. Nematicons are easy to generate (with mW optical power or less ) because the NLC dielectric medium exhibits the following properties: * A very large nonlinear response : the effective nonlinearity is typically eight orders of magnitude larger than that of carbon disulfide. This means that much lower optical powers are necessary to obtain the same refractive index variation (increase) or self-focusing to balance out diffraction. * A nonlocal response : the nonlinear response is not limited to the location of the optical field. Instead the response profile is wider than the light beam. A high nonlocality allows for stable soliton propagation even in the case of two transverse dimensions. Higher or lower powers than the exact value required for a soliton to exist lead to breathing solitons. The difference between a nonlocal and a local response. In a local medium a pointwise intensity peak such as a Dirac delta gives rise to an equally sharp spatial response in refractive index. In a nonlocal medium the refractive index change extends well past the source, similar to a diffusive system. * A saturable all-optical response: the director of the liquid crystal tends to align along the electric field of the light beam. For powerful beams the molecular director becomes parallel to the field and no further reorientation is possible. Response saturation also stabilizes two-dimensional solitons. Since the reorientational optical nonlinearity of nematic liquid crystals is accompanied by an electro-optic response to low-frequency electric fields, i.e. applied voltages, nematicons and the associated waveguides can be steered in angle and routed in space by the application of an external bias, leading to reconfigurable interconnects. In waveguide arrays where discrete solitons are knows to form, discrete nematicons have also been demonstrated See also * Soliton (optics) * Liquid crystals References External links * Spatial optical solitons in liquid crystals, a short introduction (Ghent University).

As a member of the Constituent Assembly and the Jacobin Club, he campaigned for universal manhood suffrage and the abolition both of celibacy for the clergy, and slavery. In 1791, Robespierre became an outspoken advocate for the citizens without a political voice, for their unrestricted admission to the National Guard, to public offices, and for the right to carry arms in self-defence. He played an important part in the agitation which brought about the fall of the French monarchy on 10 August 1792 and the summoning of a National Convention. His goal was to create a united and indivisible France, equality before the law, to abolish prerogatives and to defend the principles of direct democracy.Robespierre by Patrice Gueniffey, p. 306. In: A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution. Edited by Fran√ßois Furet and Mona Ozouf As one of the leading members of the insurrectionary Paris Commune, Robespierre was elected as a deputy to the French Convention in early September 1792 but was soon criticised for trying to establish either a triumvirate or a dictatorship. In April 1793, Robespierre urged the creation of a sans-culotte army to enforce revolutionary laws and sweep away any counter-revolutionary conspirator, leading to the armed Insurrection of 31 May ‚Äì 2 June 1793. In July he was appointed as a member of the powerful Committee of Public Safety, and reorganized the Revolutionary Tribunal. In October, after Robespierre proposed in vain to close the convention, the Committee declared itself as revolutionary government. Those who were not actively defending France became his enemy.Revolutionary Career of Maximilien Robespierre by David P. Jordan He exerted his influence to suppress the Girondins to the right, the H√©bertists to the left and then the Dantonists in the centre. Robespierre is best known for his role as a member of the Committee of Public Safety as he personally signed 542 arrests, especially in spring and summer 1794.Walter, G. (1961) Robespierre, p. 91-93. In: Robespierre, vol. II. L‚Äô≈ìuvre, part III. Gallimard. The question of how responsible Robespierre was for the law of 22 Prairial remains controversial.R.R. Palmer (1973) The Twelve who ruled, p. 402. Princeton University Press Coming into effect at the height of the Reign of Terror, the law removed the few procedural guarantees still afforded to the accused, vastly expanded the power of the tribunal, and ultimately resulted in the number of executions in France to rise dramatically. Although Robespierre always had like-minded allies, the politically motivated bloodshed that he incited disillusioned many. Moreover, the deist Cult of the Supreme Being that he had founded and zealously promoted generated suspicion in the eyes of both anticlericals and other parties who felt he was developing grandiose delusions about his place in French society.Gueniffey : ¬´Robespierre incarne d'une fa√ßon chimiquement pure l'id√©e de la table rase¬ª Published on June 16, 2016 in Le FigaroVoxMan of the people. Finding the real Robespierre by Patrice Higonnet Robespierre was eventually undone by his obsession with the vision of an ideal republic and his indifference to the human costs of installing it, turning both members of the Convention and the French public against him. The Terror ended when he and his allies were arrested in the Paris' town hall on 9 Thermidor. Robespierre was wounded in his jaw, but it is not known if it was self-inflicted or the outcome of the skirmish. About 90 people, including Robespierre, were executed in the days after, events that initiated a period known as the Thermidorian Reaction. After his beheading, Robespierre, who in the public consciousness had embodied the civil war and the Terror was denied burial in the Panth√©on and was instead interred in a common grave in Errancis Cemetery with many of his associates. Robespierre's legacy and reputation have since remained matters of academic and popular debate.Peter McPhee, \\"The Robespierre Problem: An Introduction,\\" H-France Salon, Vol 7 no, 14, 2015, page 9. online To some, Robespierre was the Revolution's principal ideologist and embodied the country's first democratic experience, marked by the often revised and never implemented French Constitution of 1793. To others, he was the incarnation of the Terror that followed during Year II of the French Revolutionary calendar. Early life Maximilien de Robespierre was born in Arras in the old French province of Artois. His family has been traced back to the 15th century in Vaudricourt, Pas-de-Calais; one of his ancestors, Robert de Robespierre, worked as a notary in Carvin the mid-17th century.Lavoine, A.

In: Revue du Nord, tome 5, n¬∞18, May 1914. p. 114. His paternal grandfather, also named Maximilien de Robespierre, established himself in Arras as a lawyer. His father, Fran√ßois Maximilien Barth√©l√©my de Robespierre, was a lawyer at the Conseil d'Artois who married Jacqueline Marguerite Carrault, the daughter of a brewer, when she fell pregnant with his child. Maximilien was the eldest of four children. His siblings were Charlotte (1760‚Äì1834), Henriette (1761‚Äì1780), and Augustin (1763‚Äì1794).Lavoine, A.

In: Revue du Nord, tome 5, n¬∞ 18, May 1914. p. 135 Early in July 1764, Madame de Robespierre gave birth to a stillborn daughter; she died twelve days later, at the age of 29. Devastated by his wife's death, Fran√ßois de Robespierre left Arras around 1767. His two daughters were brought up by their paternal aunts, and his two sons were taken in by their maternal grandparents. Already literate at age eight, Maximilien started attending the coll√®ge of Arras (middle school). In October 1769, on the recommendation of the bishop :fr:Louis-Hilaire de Conzi√©, he received a scholarship at the Coll√®ge Louis-le-Grand. His fellow pupils included Camille Desmoulins and Stanislas Fr√©ron. In school, he learned to admire the idealised Roman Republic and the rhetoric of Cicero, Cato and Lucius Junius Brutus. In 1776 he was awarded first prize for rhetoric. He also studied the works of the Genevan philosophe Jean-Jacques Rousseau and was attracted to many ideas, written in his \\"Contrat Social\\". Robespierre became intrigued by the idea of a \\"virtuous self\\", a man who stands alone accompanied only by his conscience. His study of the classics prompted him to aspire to Roman virtues, but he sought to emulate Rousseau's citizen-soldier in particular.Hippler, Thomas (2008) Citizens, soldiers and National Armies, p. 28-45 Robespierre's conception of revolutionary virtue and his programme for constructing political sovereignty out of direct democracy came from Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Mably.Sonenscher, M. (2008) Sans-Culottes, an eighteenth-century emblem in the French Revolution, p. 231 With Rousseau, Robespierre considered the \\"volont√© g√©n√©rale\\" or the general will of the people as the basis of political legitimacy.The Enlightenment that Failed: Ideas, Revolution, and Democratic Defeat ... By Jonathan I. Israel, p. 465-467 Early politics The house where Robespierre lived between 1787 and 1789, now on Rue Maximilien de Robespierre Robespierre studied law for three years at the University of Paris. Upon his graduation on 31 July 1780, he received a special prize of 600 livres for exemplary academic success and personal good conduct. On 15 May 1781, Robespierre gained admission to the bar. The bishop of Arras, Hilaire de Conzi√©, appointed him as one of the five judges in the criminal court in March 1782. Robespierre soon resigned, owing to discomfort in ruling on capital cases arising from his early opposition to the death penalty. His most famous case took place in May 1783 and involved a lightning rod in St. Omer. His defence was printed and he sent Benjamin Franklin a copy. On 15 November 1783, he was elected a member of the literary Academy of Arras. In 1784 the Academy of Metz awarded him a medal for his essay on the question of whether the relatives of a condemned criminal should share his disgrace, which made him a man of letters. He and Pierre Louis de Lacretelle, an advocate and journalist in Paris, divided the prize. Robespierre attacked inequality before the law, the indignity of natural children, the lettres de cachet (imprisonment without a trial) and the sidelining of women in academic life (Robespierre had particularly Louise-F√©licit√© de K√©ralio in mind). As president of the academy he became acquainted with the revolutionary journalist Gracchus Babeuf, the young officer and engineer Lazare Carnot and with the teacher Joseph Fouch√©, all of whom would play a role in his later life. Robespierre also claimed to have seen Rousseau, shortly before he died.The Revolutionary Ascetic: Evolution of a Political Type by Bruce Mazlish, p. 86 In August 1788, King Louis XVI announced new elections for all provinces and a gathering of the Estates-General for 1 May 1789 to solve France's serious financial and taxation problems. Robespierre participated in a discussion regarding how the French provincial government should be elected, arguing in his Address to the Nation of Artois that if the former mode of election by the members of the provincial estates was again adopted, the new Estates-General would not represent the people of France. In late February 1789, France saw a pressing crisis due to its desire for a new constitution, according to Gouverneur Morris. Boilly, c. 1783 (Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille) In his electoral district, Robespierre began to make his mark in politics with his Notice to the Residents of the Countryside of 1789 in which he attacked the local authorities. With this, he secured the support of the country electors. On 26 April 1789, Robespierre was elected as one of 16 deputies for Pas-de-Calais to the Estates-General; others were Charles de Lameth and Albert de Beaumetz.Liste des noms et qualit√©s de messieurs les d√©put√©s et suppl√©ants √† l'Assembl√©e nationale.

On 13 June, Robespierre joined the deputies, who would call themselves the National Assembly representing 96% of the nation.Hibbert, C. (1980) The French Revolution, p. 55. On 9 July, the Assembly moved to Paris. It transformed itself into the National Constituent Assembly to discuss a new constitution and taxation system.

While the Constituent Assembly occupied itself with male census suffrage, Robespierre and a few more deputies opposed the property requirements for voting and holding office. In December and January Robespierre succeeded in attracting the attention of the excluded classes, particularly Protestants in France, Jews, blacks, servants and actors. As a frequent speaker in the Assembly, Robespierre voiced many ideas in support of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789) and constitutional provisions for the Constitution of 1791 but rarely attracted a majority among fellow deputies, according to Malcolm Crook. Robespierre, who never gave up wearing a culotte and always 'poudr√©, fris√©, et parfum√©', seems to have been nervous, timid and suspicious. Madame de Sta√´l described Robespierre as 'very exaggerated in his democratic principles'. He supported the most absurd propositions with a coolness that had the air of conviction.

Robespierre associated with the new Society of the Friends of the Constitution, commonly known as the Jacobin Club. Originally, this organization (the Club Breton) comprised only deputies from Brittany, but after the National Assembly had moved to Paris, the Friends admitted non- deputies, supporting the changes in France. As time went on, many of the more educated artisans and small shopkeepers joined the Jacobin club. Among these 1,200 men, Robespierre found a sympathetic audience. Equality was the keystone of the Jacobin ideology. In January he held several speeches in response to the decision making the exercise of civil rights dependent on a certain sum in the tax. During the debate on the suffrage, Robespierre ended his speech of 25 January 1790 with a blunt assertion that ‚Äòall Frenchmen must be admissible to all public positions without any other distinction than that of virtues and talents‚Äô.P.

It was regarded as too aristocratic. He demanded the reconstitution of the National Guard on a democratic basis.

Article III specifically recognised the right of active citizens to meet together to draw up petitions and addresses and present them to municipal authorities. On 16‚Äì18 May when the elections began, Robespierre proposed and carried the motion that no deputy who sat in the Constituent assembly could sit in the succeeding Legislative assembly. The principal tactical purpose of this self-denying ordinance was to block the ambitions of the old leaders of the Jacobins, Antoine Barnave, Adrien Duport, and Alexandre de Lameth, aspiring to create a constitutional monarchy roughly similar to that of England.N.

On 11 June, he accepted the function of the public prosecutor in Paris.Peter McPhee, ¬´ ¬´ Mes forces et ma sant√© ne peuvent suffire ¬ª. crises politiques, crises m√©dicales dans la vie de Maximilien Robespierre, 1790-1794 ¬ª, Annales historiques de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, 371  2013, 137-152. On 13 June L'Ami du Roi, a royalist pamphlet, described Robespierre as a \\"lawyer for bandits, rebels and murderers\\". On 14 June, the abolition of the guild system was sealed; the Le Chapelier Law prohibited any kind of workers' coalition or assembly. (It concerned in the first instance as much collective petitioning by the political clubs as trade associations.) Proclaiming free enterprise as the norm upset Jean-Paul Marat, but not the urban labourer nor Robespierre. On 15 June, P√©tion became president of the \\"tribunal criminel provisoire\\", after Duport refused to work with Robespierre. After Louis XVI's failed flight to Varennes, the Assembly decreed that the king be suspended from his duties on 25 June until further notice. Between 13 and 15 July the Assembly debated the restoration of the king and his constitutional rights.

Alarmed at the progress of the Revolution, the moderate Jacobins in favour of a constitutional monarchy founded the club of the Feuillants on the next day, taking with them 264 deputies. In the evening, the King was restored in his functions. On Saturday 17 July, Bailly and La Fayette declared a ban on gathering followed by martial law.Discours de Danton, p. 152J. Israel (2014) p. 206 After the Champ de Mars massacre, the authorities ordered numerous arrests. Robespierre, who attended the Jacobin club, did not dare to go back to the rue Saintonge where he lodged, and so asked Laurent Lecointre if he knew a patriot near the Tuileries who could put him up for the night. Lecointre suggested Duplay's house and took him there. Maurice Duplay, a cabinetmaker and ardent admirer, lived at 398 Rue Saint-Honor√© near the Tuileries. After a few days, Robespierre decided to move in permanently, although he lived in the backyard and he was constantly exposed to the sound of working. He was motivated by a desire to live closer to the Assembly and the meeting place of the Jacobins in the rue Saint-Honor√©. According to his friend, the surgeon Joseph Souberbielle, Joachim Vilate, and Duplay's daughter √âlisabeth, Robespierre became engaged to Duplay's eldest daughter √âl√©onore, but his sister Charlotte vigorously denied this; also his brother Augustin refused to marry her.M√©moires de Charlotte Robespierre sur ses deux fr√®res, pp. 90‚Äì91 On 3 September, the French Constitution of 1791 was installed. On 29 September, the day before the dissolution of the Assembly, Robespierre opposed Jean Le Chapelier, who wanted to proclaim an end to the revolution and restrict the freedom of the clubs. Robespierre had been carefully preparing for this confrontation and it was the climax of his political career up to this point. P√©tion and Robespierre were brought back in triumph to their homes. (On 16 November 1791 P√©tion was elected mayor of Paris in a contest against Lafayette.) On 16 October, Robespierre held a speech for the Jacobins in Arras; one week later in B√©thune and Lille. On 28 November, he was back in the Jacobin club, where he met with a triumphant reception. Collot d'Herbois gave his chair to Robespierre, who presided that evening. Opposition to war with Austria Portrait of Robespierre (1792) by Jean-Baptist Fouquet. By using a physiognotrace a \\"grand trait\\" was produced within a few minutes. This life-size drawing on pink paper was completed by Fouquet.Collection Mus√©e de Versailles As Marat, Danton and Robespierre were not elected in the new legislature thanks to the Self-Denying Ordinance, oppositional politics often took place outside the Assembly. On 18 December 1791, Robespierre gave a (second) speech at the Jacobin club against the declaration of war. Robespierre warned against the threat of dictatorship stemming from war, in the following terms: On 25 December, Guadet, the chairman of the Assembly, suggested that 1792 should be the first year of universal liberty. Jacques Pierre Brissot stated on 29 December that a war would be a benefit to the nation and boost the economy. He urged that France should declare war against Austria. Marat and Robespierre opposed him, arguing that victory would create a dictatorship, while defeat would restore the king to his former powers; neither end, he said, would serve the revolution. This opposition from expected allies irritated the Girondins, and the war became a major point of contention between the factions. In his third speech on the war, Robespierre countered in the Jacobin club, \\"A revolutionary war must be waged to free subjects and slaves from unjust tyranny, not for the traditional reasons of defending dynasties and expanding frontiers...\\" Indeed, argued Robespierre, such a war could only favour the forces of counter-revolution, since it would play into the hands of those who opposed the sovereignty of the people. The risks of Caesarism were clear, for, in wartime, the powers of the generals would grow at the expense of ordinary soldiers, and the power of the king and court at the expense of the Assembly. These dangers should not be overlooked, he reminded his listeners; \\"...in troubled periods of history, generals often became the arbiters of the fate of their countries.\\" Already, Robespierre knew that he had lost, as he failed to gather a majority. His speech was nevertheless published and sent to all clubs and Jacobin societies of France.

He began by assuring his audience that everything he intended to propose was strictly constitutional. He then went on to advocate specific measures to strengthen, not so much the national defences as the forces that could be relied on to defend the revolution. Not only the National Guard but also the people had to be armed, if necessary with pikes. Robespierre promoted a people's army, continuously under arms and able to impose its will on Feuillants and Girondins in the Constitutional Cabinet of Louis XVI and in the Legislative Assembly.Cobb, R. (1987) The People's Armies, p. 22. Yale University Press The Jacobins decided to study his speech before deciding whether it should be printed. The Girondins planned strategies to out-manoeuvre Robespierre's influence among the Jacobins. He was accused by Brissot and Guadet of trying to become the idol of the people.V. Aulard (1892) Jacobins, III, p. 526 On 26 March, Guadet accused Robespierre of superstition, relying on divine providence; being against the war he was also accused of acting as a secret agent for the Austrian Committee. When in Spring 1792, under pressure from the Assembly, the king accepted a few Girondin ministers into his cabinet, according to Louvet it was only due to a smear campaign by Robespierre and his followers that he was not also appointed.Arnold Heumakers (1988) Een homme de lettres in de Franse Revolutie: de ‚ÄòM√©moires‚Äô van Jean- Baptiste Louvet de Couvray (1760-1797), p. 17. In: Maatstaf. Jaargang 36 On 10 April, Robespierre resigned the post of public prosecutor, which he had officially held since 15 February. He explained his resignation to the Jacobin Club, on 27 April, as part of his speech responding to the accusations against him. He threatened to leave the Jacobins, claiming he preferred to continue his mission as an ordinary citizen.H. Leuwers (2014) Robespierre, p. 211 On 17 May, Robespierre published the first issue of his journal Le D√©fenseur de la Constitution (The Defender of the Constitution), in which he attacked Brissot and publicised his scepticism over the whole war movement. The journal served multiple purposes: to print his speeches, to counter the influence of the royal court in public policy, to defend him from the accusations of Girondist leaders and to give voice to the economic and democratic interests of the broader masses in Paris and defend their rights.Lang, Timothy, \\"Rousseau and the Paradox of the Nation-State\\" (2018).

Davidson, p. 86 On 23 April Robespierre demanded Marquis de Lafayette to step down. Robespierre responded by working to reduce the political influence of the officer class and the king. While arguing for the welfare of common soldiers, Robespierre urged new promotions to mitigate the domination of the officer class by the aristocratic and royalist √âcole Militaire and the conservative National Guard. Along with other Jacobins, he urged in the fifth issue of his magazine the creation of an \\"arm√©e r√©volutionnaire\\" in Paris, consisting of at least 20,000 men, to defend the city, \\"liberty\\" (the revolution), maintain order in the sections and educate the members in democratic principles; an idea he borrowed from Jean- Jacques Rousseau. According to Jean Jaures, he considered this even more important than the right to strike. On 29 May 1792, the Assembly dissolved the Constitutional Guard, suspecting it of royalist and counter-revolutionary sympathies. In early June 1792, Robespierre proposed an end to the monarchy and the subordination of the Assembly to the General will. Following the king's veto of the Assembly's efforts to suppress nonjuring priests on 27 May, on proposal of Carnot and Servan in the Assembly to raise a (permanent) militia of volunteers on 8 June,Robespierre, Oeuvres compl√®tes, volume 4, p. 138, 143 and the reinstatement of Brissotin ministers dismissed on 18 June, the monarchy faced an abortive demonstration of 20 June. Sergent-Marceau and Panis, the administrators of police, were sent out by P√©tion to urge the Sans- culottes to lay down their weapons, telling them it was illegal to present a petition in arms (to demand the king to apply the constitution, accept the decrees, and recall the ministers). Their march to the Tuileries was not banned. They invited the officials to join the procession and march along with them.Taine, H. (2011) The Origins of Contemporary France, p. 298. Because French forces suffered disastrous defeats and a series of defections at the onset of the war, Robespierre and Marat feared the possibility of a military coup d'√©tat. One was led by the Lafayette, head of the National Guard, who at the end of June advocated the suppression of the Jacobin Club. Robespierre publicly attacked him in scathing terms: On 2 July, the Assembly authorized the National Guard to go to the Festival of Federation on 14 July, thus circumventing a royal veto. On 11 July, the Jacobins won an emergency vote in the wavering Assembly, declaring the nation in danger and drafting all Parisians with pikes into the National Guard. (Meanwhile, F√©d√©r√©s entered the city for the celebration of 14 July; P√©tion was reinstalled.) On 15 July, Billaud-Varenne in the Jacobin club outlined the program following the uprising; the deportation of all the Bourbons, the cleansing of the National Guard, the election of a Convention, the \\"transfer of the Royal veto to the people\\", the deportation of all \\"enemies of the people\\" and exemption of the poorest from taxation. This sentiment reflected the perspective of more radical Jacobins including those of the Marseille Club, who wrote to the mayor and the people of Paris, \\"Here and at Toulon, we have debated the possibility of forming a column of 100,000 men to sweep away our enemies... Paris may have need of help. Call on us!\\" A few days later the news of the Brunswick Manifesto began sweeping through Paris. It was frequently described as unlawful and offensive to national sovereignty.\\"The Myth of the Foreign Enemy? The Brunswick Manifesto and the Radicalization of the French Revolution,\\" French History 25, no. 2 (2011): 188-213 by Elisabeth Cross On 1 August the Assembly voted on Carnot's proposal and ordered the municipalities that pikes should be issued to all citizens, except vagabonds, etc.Lazare Carnot, republican patriot, by Huntley Dupre, p. 48Le Logographe, 1 a√¥ut 1792; Gazette nationale ou le Moniteur universel, 2 ao√ªt 1792Collection Compl√®te des Lois, D√©crets, Ordonnances, R√©glements, p. 330 On 3 August the mayor and 47 sections demanded the deposition of the king. On 4 August the government planned to evade; during the night volunteers from Marseille moved into the Cordeliers Convent. On 5 August Robespierre announced the uncovering of a plan for the king to escape to Ch√¢teau de Gaillon. On 7 August P√©tion suggested to Robespierre to contribute to the departure of F√©d√©r√©s to appease the capital.Max Gallo (2007) Robespierre, p. 169 The Council of Ministers suggested arresting Danton, Marat and Robespierre if they visited the Jacobin club.R. Cobb, p. 150 On 9 August, when the Assembly refused to impeach LaFayette, the tocsin called the sections into arms.N. Hampson (1978) Danton, p. 72 In the evening the \\"commissionaires\\" of several sections (Billaud- Varenne, Chaumette, H√©bert, Hanriot, Fleuriot-Lescot, Pache, Bourdon) gathered in the town hall. At midnight the municipal government of the city was dissolved. Sulpice Huguenin, head of the sans-culottes of the Faubourg Saint- Antoine, was appointed provisional president of the Insurrectionary Commune. Early in the morning on (Friday, 10 August) 30,000 F√©d√©r√©s (volunteers from the countryside) and Sans-culottes (militants from the Paris sections) led a successful assault upon the Tuileries; according to Robespierre a triumph for the \\"passive\\" (non-voting) citizens. The frightened Assembly suspended the king and voted for the election of a National Convention to take its place.N. Hampson (1978) Danton, p. 74 On the night of 11 August Robespierre was elected to the Paris Commune as a representative for the \\"Section de Piques\\"; the district where he lived. The governing committee called for the summoning of a convention chosen by universal male suffrage, to form a new government and reorganize France. On 13 August Robespierre declared himself against the strengthening of the d√©partments.I. Davidson, p. 109 On 14 August Danton invited him to join the Council of Justice. Robespierre published the twelfth and last issue of \\"Le D√©fenseur de la Constitution\\", both an account and political testament. On 16 August, Robespierre presented a petition to the Legislative Assembly from the Paris Commune to demand the establishment of a provisional Revolutionary Tribunal that had to deal with the \\"traitors\\" and \\"enemies of the people\\". The next day Robespierre was appointed as one of eight judges, but he refused to preside over it. He declined any position that might take him out of the political arena. (Fouquier-Tinville was appointed as president.) The Prussian army crossed the French frontier on 19 August. The Paris armed sections were incorporated in 48 battalions of the National Guard under Santerre. The Assembly decreed that all the non-juring priests had to leave Paris within a week and the country within two weeks.Le Moniteur universel, t. XIII, n¬∞ 241, du 28 a√¥ut, p. 540 On 27 August, in the presence of almost half the population of Paris, a funeral ceremony was held on Place du Carrousel for the victims who were killed during storming the Tuileries.Rachel Rogers (2012) Vectors of Revolution: The British Radical Community in Early Republican Paris, 1792‚Äì1794, p. 467 The passive citizens still strived for acceptance and the supply of weapons. Danton proposed that the Assembly should authorize house searches ‚Äòto distribute to the defenders of the \\"Patrie\\" the weapons that indolent or ill-disposed citizens may be hiding‚Äô. The section Sans-culottes organized it self as surveillance committee, conducting searches and making arrests all over Paris.R. Dupuy (2010) La Garde nationale 1789-1872. Paris, Gallimard, The gates were closed to prevent (royalist) suspects and deputies would leave the city. The raids began on 29 August which seem to have gone on for another two days. Marat and Robespierre both disliked Condorcet who proposed that the \\"enemies of the people\\" belonged to the whole nation and should be judged constitutionally in its name. A sharp conflict developed between the Legislative and the Commune and its sections. On 30 August the interim minister of Interior Roland and Guadet tried to suppress the influence of the Commune because the sections had exhausted the searches. The Assembly, tired of the pressures, declared the Commune illegal and suggested the organization of communal elections. Robespierre was no longer willing to cooperate with Brissot, who promoted the Duke of Brunswick, and Roland, who proposed that the members of the government should leave Paris, taking the treasury and the king with it. On Sunday morning 2 September the members of the Commune, gathering in the town hall to proceed the election of deputies to the National Convention, decided to maintain their seats and have Rolland and Brissot arrested. Madame de Sta√´l who tried to escape Paris was forced by the crowd to go to the town hall. She noted that Robespierre was in the chair that day, assisted by Collot d'Herbois and Billaud-Varenne as secretaries. The National Convention Imaginary meeting between Robespierre, Danton and Marat (illustrating Victor Hugo's novel Ninety-Three ) by Alfred Loudet On 2 September 1792 French National Convention election began. At the same time, Paris was organizing its defence, but it was confronted with a lack of arms for the thousands of volunteers. Danton delivered a speech in the assembly and possibly referring to the (Swiss) inmates: \\"We ask that anyone who refuses to serve in person, or to surrender their weapons, is punished with death.Assembl√©e NationaleJ.

Oliver, p. 112 On 21 September P√©tion was elected as president of the convention; nearly all members were lawyers. The Jacobins and Cordeliers took the high benches at the back of the former Salle du Man√®ge, giving them the label the \\"Montagnards\\", or \\"the Mountaineers\\"; below them were the \\"Man√®ge\\" of the Girondists, moderate Republicans. The majority the Plain was formed by independents (as Bar√®re, Cambon and Carnot) but dominated by the radical Mountain.J.F. Bernard (1973) Talleyrand: a biography, p. 106 On 25 and 26 September, the Girondists Barbaroux and Lasource accused Robespierre of wanting to form a dictatorship. Danton was asked to resign as minister as he was also a deputy. Rumours spread that Robespierre, Marat and Danton were plotting to establish a triumvirate to save the First French Republic. (From October 1791 until September 1792 the French Legislative Assembly saw an unprecedented turnover of four ministers of Justice, four ministers of Navy, six ministers of the interior, seven ministers of foreign affairs, and eight ministers of war.The French Legislative Assembly of 1791 by C. J. Mitchell, p. 174) On 30 September Robespierre advocated for better laws; the registration of marriages, births and burials was withdrawn from the church. On 29 October, Louvet de Couvrai attacked Robespierre. He accused him of star allures, and have done nothing to stop the September massacre; instead, he had used it to have more Montagnards elected. Robespierre, who seems to have been sick was given a week to respond. On 5 November, Robespierre defended himself, the Jacobin Club and his supporters in and beyond Paris: Turning the accusations upon his accusers, Robespierre delivered one of the most famous lines of the French Revolution to the Assembly: In November 1792 Condorcet considered the French Revolution as a religion and Robespierre had all the characteristics of a leader of a sect,The Works: With Memoirs of His Life and Writings by Robert Anderson, Volume 3 by John Moore, p. 377-379The Enlightenment that Failed: Ideas, Revolution, and Democratic Defeat ... By Jonathan I. Israel, p. 483 or a cult.The French Revolution: Faith, Desire and Politics by Noah Shusterman, p. 147 As his opponents knew well, Robespierre had a strong base of support among the women of Paris. John Moore (Scottish physician) was sitting in the galleries, and noted that the audience was ‚Äòalmost entirely Ô¨Ålled with women‚Äô. He is a priest who has his devotees but it is evident that all of his power lies in the distaff. Robespierre tried to appeal to women because in the early days of the Revolution when he had tried to appeal to men, he had failed. The Girondines called on the local authorities to oppose the concentration and centralization of power. =Execution of Louis XVI= De S√®ze, Valaz√© √† l'assembl√©e de la Convention, salle du Man√®ge, palais des Tuileries, 26 d√©cembre. Engraving by Reinier Vinkeles The convention's unanimous declaration of a French Republic on 21 September 1792 left the fate of the former king open to debate. A commission was therefore established to examine the evidence against him while the convention's Legislation Committee considered legal aspects of any future trial. Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, while the Girondins were more divided concerning how to proceed, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others for clemency, and others advocating lesser punishment or banishment. On 13 November Robespierre stated in the Convention that a Constitution which Louis had violated himself, and which declared his inviolability, could not now be used in his defence. Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support Saint-Just, a former colonel in the National Guard, who gave his first major speech to address and argue against the king's inviolability. On 20 November, opinion turned sharply against Louis following the discovery of a secret cache of 726 documents consisting of Louis's personal communications with bankers and ministers. At his trial, he claimed not to recognize documents clearly signed by himself.Hardman, John (2016) The life of Louis XVI, p. ? With the question of the king's fate now occupying public discourse, Robespierre delivered on 3 December a speech that would define the rhetoric and course of Louis's trial. All the deputies from the Mountain were asked to attend. Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety: In arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of Jean-Baptiste Mailhe, who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war. While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the Dauphin of France, Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment: On 4 December the Convention decreed all the royalist writings illegal.William J. Murray (1986) The right-wing press in the French Revolution 1789-792 Royal Historical Society Studies in History 44, p. 1 26 December was the day of the last hearing of the King. On 14 January 1793, the king was unanimously voted guilty of conspiracy and attacks upon public safety. On 15 January the call for a referendum was defeated by 424 votes to 287, which Robespierre led. On 16 January, voting began to determine the king's sentence and the session continued for 24 hours. During this time, Robespierre worked fervently to ensure the king's execution. Of the 721 deputies who voted, at least 361 had to vote for death. The Jacobins successfully defeated the Girondins' final appeal for clemency.P. McPhee (2016) Liberty or Death, p. 172 On 20 January 1793 Robespierre defended the September massacres as necessary.Oeuvres de Maximilien Robespierre, Band 9 by Maximilien Robespierre,p. 263-264 The next day Louis XVI was guillotined at the Place de la R√©volution. =Destruction of the Girondists= Journ√©es des 31 Mai, 1er et 2 Juin 1793, an engraving of the Convention surrounded by National Guards, forcing the deputies to arrest the Girondins and to establish an armed force of 6,000 men.

The scene takes place in front of the Deputies Chamber in the Tuileries. The depiction shows Marie-Jean H√©rault de S√©chelles and Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud. After the execution of the king, the influence of Robespierre, Danton and the pragmatic politicians increased at the expense of the Girondins who were largely seen as responsible for the inadequate response to the Flanders Campaign they had themselves initiated. At the end of February, more than a thousand shops were plundered in Paris. Protesters claimed that the Girondins were responsible for the high prices.L. Moore, p. 172 On 24 February the Convention decreed the first, but unsuccessful Lev√©e en Masse as the attempt to draft new troops set off an uprising in rural France. The Montagnards lost influence in Marseille, Toulon and Lyon. On 10 March 1793, a provisional Revolutionary Tribunal was established; the Convention appointed Fouquier-Tinville as the public prosecutor and Fleuriot-Lescot as his assistant. On 12 March Charles-Fran√ßois Dumouriez criticized the interference of officials of the War Ministry which employed many Jacobins.I. Davidson, p. 108, 150 The Jacobin leaders were quite sure that, after the Battle of Neerwinden (1793), France had come close to a military coup mounted by Dumouriez and supported by the Girondins. On 18 March Bar√®re proposed to establish a Committee of Public Safety. On 22 March Dumouriez urged the Duke of Chartres to join his plan to dissolve the convention, to restore the French Constitution of 1791, the restoration of a constitutional monarchy and to free Marie-Antoinette and her children.P.C.

(1961) Robespierre √† la tribune, p. 280-281. In: L‚Äô≈ìuvre, vol. II, part IV. Gallimard. He left the committee after eight days, not willing to cooperate with Girondins. On 3 April Robespierre declared before the Convention that the whole war was a prepared game between Dumouriez and Brissot to overthrow the Republic. On 5 April the Convention substantially expanded the power of the Tribunal r√©volutionnaire; the Montagne raised the stakes by sending out a circular from the Jacobin Club in Paris to all the sister Jacobin clubs across France, appealing for petitions demanding the recall ‚Äì that is, the expulsion from the convention ‚Äì of any deput√©s who had tried to save the life of ‚Äòthe tyrant‚Äô. On 6 April the Committee of Public Safety was installed with deputies from the Plaine and the Dantonists but no Girondins or Robespierrists.Davidson, I. (2016) The French Revolution, p. 155-156. PROFILE BOOKS LTD. Kindle Edition. Robespierre who was not elected was pessimistic about the prospects of parliamentary action and told the Jacobins that it was necessary to raise an army of Sans-culottes to defend Paris and arrest infidel deputies, naming and accusing the Duke of Orleans, Brissot, Vergniaud, Guadet and Gensonn√©.I. Davidson, p. 157 There are only two parties according to Robespierre: the people and its enemies. Robespierre's speeches during April 1793 reflect the growing radicalization. \\"I ask the sections to raise an army large enough to form the kernel of a Revolutionary Army that will draw all the sans-culottes from the departments to exterminate the rebels ...\\" \\"Force the government to arm the people, who in vain demanded arms for two years.\\" Suspecting further treason, Robespierre on 13 April invited the convention to vote the death penalty against anyone who would propose negotiating with the enemy.N. Hampson (1978) Danton, p. 118 On 15 April the convention was stormed by the people of from the sections, demanding the removal of the Girondins. Till 17 April the Convention discussed the Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1793, a French political document that preceded that country's first republican constitution. On 18 April the Commune announced an insurrection against the convention after the arrest of Marat. On 19 April Robespierre opposed article 7 on equality before the law; on 22 April the Convention discussed article 29 on the right of resistance.Walter, G. (1961) Le vaincu du neuf Thermidor, p. 51-52, 63. In: L‚Äô≈ìuvre, vol. II, part III. Gallimard. On 24 April 1793 Robespierre presented his version with four articles on the right of property. Robespierre was in effect questioning the individual right of ownership.Fair Shares for All: Jacobin Egalitarianism in Practice by Jean-Pierre Gross, p. 37 He advocated a progressive tax and fraternity between the people of all the nations.

Robespierre pressed ahead with his strategy of class war.Davidson, Ian. The French Revolution, p. 159. On 8 and 12 May in the Jacobin club, Robespierre restated the necessity of founding a revolutionary army to be funded by a tax on the rich and would be intended to defeat aristocrats and counter-revolutionaries inside both the Convention and across France. He said that public squares should be used to produce arms and pikes. After hearing these statements, the Girondins became concerned. On 18 May Guadet called for the closing of all the political institutions in Paris and to examine the \\"exactions\\" and to replace municipal authorities.The Cambridge Modern History, Band 8, p. 271 got no support, the Convention decided instead to set up a commission of inquiry of twelve members, with a very strong Girondin majority. H√©bert, the editor of Le P√®re Duchesne, was arrested for attacking its members. The next day, the Commune demanded that H√©bert be released. Maximin Isnard, who had enough of the tyranny of the municipality, then threatened with the destruction of Paris. On 24 May the Twelve proposed reinforcing the National Guard patrols round the convention.N. Hampson (1978) Danton, p. 113 On 26 May, after a week of silence, Robespierre delivered one of the most decisive speeches of his career. He openly called at the Jacobin Club \\"to place themselves in insurrection against corrupt deputies\\". Isnard declared that the convention would not be influenced by any violence and that Paris had to respect the representatives from elsewhere in France. The Convention decided Robespierre would not be heard and Isnard hindered him to speak. The atmosphere became extremely agitated; some deputies were willing to kill if Isnard dared to declare civil war. On 28 May the Commune accepted the creation of a sans-culottes army to protect the revolution and enforce revolutionary laws. Robespierre called for an armed insurrection against the majority of the convention. On 29 May, the delegates representing 33 of the Paris sections formed an insurrectionary committee. On 30 May several new members were added to the Committee of Public Safety: Saint-Just, Couthon and H√©rault- Seychelles.R.R. Palmer (1973) The Twelve who ruled, p. 32. Princeton University Press Early in the morning of Friday 31 May the tocsin in the Notre-Dame was rung and the city gates were closed. Hanriot ordered to fire a cannon on the Pont-Neuf as a sign of alarm. Vergniaud suggested to arrest Hanriot. Robespierre attacked Vergniaud and accused the Girondins of royalism. He urged the arrest of the Girondins, who had supported the installation of the Commission of Twelve. Around ten in the morning 12,000 armed citizens appeared to protect the Convention against the arrest of Girondin deputies. In the afternoon the Commune demanded the creation of a Revolutionary army of sansculottes in every town of France, including 20,000 men in Paris.Davidson, Ian. The French Revolution, p. 160 On Saturday 1 June the Comit√© insurrectionnel ordered the arrest of Roland and √âtienne Clavi√®re. Hanriot declared he would not stop the people if the 26 Girondins were not arrested. It ordered Hanriot, to surround the Convention ‚Äòwith a respectable armed force‚Äô.Davidson, Ian. The French Revolution, p. 161 In the evening 40,000 men surrounded the convention to force the arrest. The attack on the representatives was led by Marat. He called for the arrest of the deputies, who in January had voted against the execution of the King and since then paralyzing the convention.Roger Dupuy (2010) La Garde nationale 1789-1872. Paris, Gallimard, The commune declaring itself duped demanded and prepared a \\"Supplement\\" to the revolution. The next day Hanriot was ordered to march his National Guard from the town hall to the National Palace. In the early evening on 2 June, a large force of armed citizens, some estimated 80,000 or 100,000, but Danton spoke of 30,000 souls,Le R√©publicain fran√ßais, 14 septembre 1793, p. 2 surrounded the convention with artillery. \\"The armed force\\", Hanriot said, \\"will retire only when the Convention has delivered to the people the deputies denounced by the Commune.\\" The Girondins believed they were protected by the law, but the people on the galleries called for their arrest. The accused Girondins attempted to exit, walked around the palace in a theatrical procession and confronted on all sides by bayonets and pikes, returned to the meeting hall and submitted to the inevitable. Twenty-two Girondins were seized one by one after some juggling with names. They finally decided that 31 deputies were not to be imprisoned, but only subject to house arrest.Davidson, Ian. The French Revolution, p. 161-162 The Montagnards now had unchallenged control of the convention; according to Couthon the citizens of Paris had saved the country.Walter, G.

James (1938) The Black Jacobins: Toussaint L'Ouverture, p. 138 Within two weeks and for three months almost fifty departments were in rebellion. During the insurrection of 31 May ‚Äì 2 June 1793 Robespierre had scrawled a note in his memorandum-book: On 3 June French the Convention decided to split up the land belonging to √âmigr√©s and sell it to farmers. On 13 July Robespierre defended the plans of Le Peletier to teach revolutionary ideas in schools. On the following day the Convention rushed to praise Marat - who was murdered in his bath tube - for his fervor and revolutionary diligence. Opposing Pierre-Louis Bentabole Robespierre simply called for an inquiry into the circumstances of his death. On 17 or 22 July the √âmigres were expropriated by decree; proofs of ownership had to be collected and burnt.

Artist unknown After the fall of the Girondins, the French government faced serious internal challenges, when four provincial cities‚ÄîCaen, Bordeaux, Lyon, and Marseille‚Äîrebelled against the more radical revolutionaries in Paris. In July France threatened to plunge into civil war, attacked by the aristocracy in Vend√©e and Brittany, by federalism in Lyon, in Le Midi and in Normandy, in a struggle with all Europe and the foreign factions. On 27 July 1793, Robespierre was added to the Committee of Public Safety and replaced Gasparin the only member of a sleeping subcommittee of war.Histoire de la revolution Fran√ßaise, Volume 8 by Jules Michelet, p. 37 It was the second time he held any executive office to coordinate the war effort. It may seem Robespierre behaved as a kind of Minister without Portfolio, apparently as the unofficial prime-minister but the committee was non-hierarchical.Raphael Matta Duvignau, \\"The Committee of public safety (6th April 1793 ‚Äî 4th brumaire an IV)\\", The French Revolution [online], 3  2012, online since 20 December 2012, accessed 25 February 2019. DOI : 10.4000/lrf.773 On 4 August the French Constitution of 1793 which included universal suffrage passed through the convention. Article 109 stated: All Frenchmen are soldiers; all shall be exercised in the use of arms.FRENCH CONSTITUTION of the twenty-fourth of June, 1793 From the moment of its acceptance, it was made meaningless, first by the Convention itself, which had been charged to dissolve itself on completion of the document, then by the construction of the working institutions of the Terror. On 21 August Robespierre was elected as president of the convention.Mandats √† l‚ÄôAssembl√©e nationale ou √† la Chambre des d√©put√©s On 23 August Lazare Carnot was appointed in the Committee; the provisional government introduced the Lev√©e en masse against the enemies of the republic. Robespierre was particularly concerned that the public officials should be virtuous. He sent his brother Augustin (and sister Charlotte) to Marseille and Nice to suppress the federalist insurrection. On 4 September, the Sans- culottes again invaded the convention. They demanded tougher measures against rising prices and the setting up of a system of terror to root out the counter-revolution, despite the amount of assignats in circulation doubled in the previous months. On 5 September the Convention decided on a proposal of Chaumette, supported by Billaud and Danton to form a revolutionary army of 6,000 men in Paris to sweep away conspirators, to execute revolutionary laws and to protect subsistence.Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 22; R.R. Palmer (1970) The Twelve who ruled, p. 47-51 The next day the ultra's Collot d'Herbois and Billaud-Varenne were elected in the Committee of Public Safety. The Committee of General Security which was tasked with rooting out crimes and preventing counter-revolution began to manage the country's National Gendarmerie and finance. On 8 September, the banks and exchange offices were closed to prevent the exchange of forged assignats and the export of capital.Macroeconomic Features of the French Revolution by Thomas J. Sargent and Fran√ßois R. Velde. In: Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 103, No. 3 (Jun. 1995). Published by: The University of Chicago Press. pp. 504‚Äì05 On 11 September the power of the Comit√© de Salut Public was extended for one month. On 17 September, the Law of Suspects was passed, which authorized the imprisonment of vaguely defined \\"suspects\\" within 24 hours. Jacques Thuriot, a firm supporter of Danton, resigned on 20 September because of irreconcilable differences with Robespierre and became one of the bolder opponents of Maximilien Robespierre.Davidson, Ian. The French Revolution, p. 188 The Revolutionary Tribunal was reorganized and divided into four sections, of which two were always active at the same time.

Robespierre called for the dissolution of the convention; he believed they would be admired by posterity. The president Cambon replied that was not his intention; applause followed and the session was closed.Le Moniteur Universel 11/10/1793, p. 2 After the Siege of Lyon Couthon entered the city, the centre of a revolt.

Palmer (1973) The Twelve who ruled, p. 55 quit politics and set off to Arcis-sur-Aube with his 16-year-old wife, who pitied the Queen since her trial began. On 12 October when H√©bert accused Marie-Antoinette of incest with her son, Robespierre had dinner with Bar√®re, Saint-Just and Joachim Vilate. Discussing the matter, Robespierre broke his plate with his fork and called H√©bert an \\"imb√©cile\\". According to Vilate Robespierre then had already two or three bodyguards. One of them was his neighbour, the printer Nicolas. The verdict of the former queen, pronounced by the jury of the Revolutionary Tribunal, on the 16th, at four o'clock in the morning, was executed at noon.LAST LETTER OF MARIE-ANTOINETTE Centre historique des Archives nationale On 25 October the Revolutionary government was accused of doing nothing. At the end of the month, several members of the General Security Committee assisted by arm√©es revolutionnaires were sent into the provinces to suppress active resistance against the Jacobins. Fouch√© and Collot d'Herbois halted the revolt of Lyon against the National Convention, Jean-Baptiste Carrier ordered the drownings at Nantes; Tallien succeeded in feeding the guillotine in Bordeaux; Barras and Fr√©ron went to Marseille and Toulon and Joseph Le Bon in Somme and Pas-de-Calais. Saint-Just and Le Bas visited the Rhine Army to watch the generals and punish officers for the least sign of treasonous timidity, or lack of initiative.Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 23 On 31 October Brissot and 21 Girondins were guillotined in 36 minutes. On 8 November the director of the manufacture of assignats and Manon Roland were executed. On the morning of 14 November, Fran√ßois Chabot burst into Robespierre's room dragging him from bed with accusations of counter-revolution and a foreign conspiracy, waving a hundred thousand livres in assignat notes, claiming that a band of royalist plotters gave it to him to buy Fabre d'Eglantine's vote, along with others, to liquidate some stock in the French East India Company. Chabot was arrested three days later; Courtois urged Danton to return to Paris immediately. On 25 November, the remains of Comte de Mirabeau were removed from the Pantheon and replaced with those of Jean-Paul Marat. It was on the initiative of Robespierre when it became known that in his last months the count had secretly conspired with the court of Louis XVI. On 3 December Robespierre accused Danton in the Jacobin club of feigning an illness with the intention to emigrate to Switzerland. Danton showed too often his vices and not his virtue. Robespierre was stopped in his attack. The gathering was closed after applause for Danton.Le Moniteur Universel 6/12/1793 On 4 December, by the Law of Revolutionary Government, the independence of departmental and local authorities came to an end, when extensive powers of Committee of Public Safety were codified. This law, submitted by Billaud, implemented within 24 hours, was a drastic decision against the independence of deputies and commissionaires on a mission; coordinated action among the sections became illegal.Non-Violence and the French Revolution: Political Demonstrations in Paris ... by Micah Alpaugh, p. 158 The Commune of Paris and the revolutionary committees in the sections had to obey the law, the two Committees and the convention.Le Moniteur Universel de 5 d√©cembre 1793, p. 4 On 7 December all the arm√©es revolutionnaires in France were dismissed within 24 hours (except the ones authorized by the convention as in Paris).Le Moniteur Universel de 9 d√©cembre 1793, art. XVIII On 12 December the Indulgents mounted an attack on the Committee of Public Safety being murderers. Under intense emotional pressure from Lyonnaise women, Robespierre suggested that a secret commission be set up to examine the cases of the Lyon rebels, to see if injustices had been committed by Collot d'Herbois and Fouch√©. This is the closest Robespierre came to adopting a public position against the use of terror. =The \\"enemy within\\"= Triumvirate of : (L-R) Saint-Just, Robespierre, and Couthon Cartoon showing Robespierre guillotining the executioner after having guillotined everyone else in France. On 5 December the journalist Camille Desmoulins launched a new journal, Le Vieux Cordelier. He defended Danton and warned not to exaggerate the revolution. He compared Robespierre with Julius Caesar and arguing that the Revolution should return to its original ideas en vogue around 10 August 1792. In the third issue he change tone. Robespierre made a counterproposal, to set up a Committee of Justice to examine some of the cases under the Law of Suspects.Davidson, Ian. The French Revolution, p. 211 In the fourth issue Desmoulins took up the cause of the 200,000 defenseless civilians and had been detained in prisons as suspects.Press in the French Revolution by John Thomas Gilchrist, p. 19 A Committee of Grace had to be established. Desmoulins addressed Robespierre directly, writing, \\"My dear Robespierre... my old school friend... Remember the lessons of history and philosophy: love is stronger, more lasting than fear.\\"Scurr, 298 Desmoulins counselled Robespierre not to attempt to build the Republic on such a rare quality as virtue. On the next day, December 25, thoroughly provoked by Desmoulins‚Äô insistent challenges, Robespierre produced his Report on the Principles of Revolutionary Government. Robespierre replied to the plea for an end to the Terror, justifying the collective dictatorship of the National Convention, administrative centralization, and the purging of local authorities. He said he had to avoid two cliffs: indulgence and severity. He could not consult the 18th century political authors, because they had not foreseen such a course of events. He protested against the various factions [H√©bertists and Dantonists] that threatened the government.Construire une nouvelle cat√©gorie politique: Robespierre et la th√©orie du gouvernement r√©volutionnaire par Herv√© Leuwers, p. 12 Robespierre strongly believed that the Terror should be increased in intensity, rather than diminished; \\"the Government has to defend itself\\" [against conspirators] and \\"to the enemies of the people it owes only death.\\"G. Rud√© (1967) Robespierre, p. 58‚Äì67 According to R.R. Palmer and Donald C. Hodges, this was the first important statement in modern times of a philosophy of dictatorship.R.R. Palmer, p. 264[Hodges, Donald Clark (25 April 2003). Deep Republicanism: Prelude to Professionalism. Lexington Books. pp. 91‚Äì92. ‚Äì via Google Books.] In his Report on the Principles of Political Morality of 5 February 1794, Robespierre praised the revolutionary government and argued that terror and virtue were necessary: > If virtue is the spring of a popular government in times of peace, the > spring of that government during a revolution is virtue combined with > terror: virtue, without which terror is destructive; terror, without which > virtue is impotent. Terror is only justice prompt, severe and inflexible; it > is then an emanation of virtue; it is less a distinct principle than a > natural consequence of the general principle of democracy, applied to the > most pressing wants of the country ... The government in a revolution is the > despotism of liberty against tyranny. Aulard sums up the Jacobin train of thought, \\"All politics, according to Robespierre, must tend to establish the reign of virtue and confound vice. He reasoned thus: those who are virtuous are right; error is a corruption of the heart; error cannot be sincere; error is always deliberate.\\"Rude, George (ed.), Robespierre, (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1967), p. 136. From 13 February to 13 March 1794, Robespierre had withdrawn from active business on the Committee due to illness. (On 19 February, Maximilien decided therefore to return to the Duplays.L. Jacob (1960) H√©bert, Le P√®re Duchesne. Chef des sans- culottes, p. 326.) In a speech at the Cordeliers Club, H√©bert attacks both the factions of Danton and Robespierre. On 15 March, Robespierre reappeared in the convention. Subsequently, he joined Saint-Just in his attacks on H√©bert. H√©bert, the voice of the Sans-culottes, had been using the latest issue of Le P√®re Duchesne to criticize Robespierre. (There were queues and near-riots at the shops and in the markets; there were strikes and threatening public demonstrations; and some of the H√©bertistes and their friends were calling for a new insurrection.Davidson, Ian. The French Revolution, p. 215) On the night of 13‚Äì14 March, H√©bert and 18 of his followers were arrested on charges of complicity with foreign powers and guillotined on 24 March. Their death was a sort of carnival, a pleasant spectacle according to Michelet's witnesses. The leaders of the \\"arm√©es r√©volutionnaires\\" were denounced by the Revolutionary Tribunal as accomplices of H√©bert.The Morning Chronicle (18 August) and Gazette Nationale ou Le Moniteur Universel (29 July) On 25 March Condorcet was arrested as he was seen as an enemy of the Revolution; he committed suicide two days later. On 29 March Danton met again with Robespierre privately; afterwards, Marat's sister urged him to take the offensive.N. Hampson (1878) Danton, p. 160-161 On 30 March the two committees decided to arrest Danton and Desmoulins after Saint-Just became uncharacteristically angry. On 31 March Saint-Just publicly attacked both. In the Convention criticism was voiced against the arrests, which Robespierre silenced with \\"...whoever trembles at this moment is guilty.\\"History of the French Revolution by Adolphe Thiers, p. 426 Legendre suggested to hear Danton in the convention but Robespierre replied \\"It would be violating the laws of impartiality to grant to Danton what was refused to others, who had an equal right to make the same demand. This answer silenced at once all solicitations in his favour.\\"Annual Register, Band 36. Published by Edmund Burke, p. 118. No friend of the Dantonists dared speak up in case he too should be accused of putting friendship before virtue. On 2 April the trial began on charges of conspiracy with the Duke of Orl√©ans and Dumouriez. Corruption and a financial scandal involving the French East India Company provided a \\"convenient pretext\\" for Danton's downfall.W. Doyle (1990) The Oxford History of the French Revolution, pp. 272‚Äì74.Gazette nationale ou le Moniteur universel 5 April 1794 The Dantonists were not serving the people. They had become false patriots, who had preferred personal and foreign interests to the welfare of the nation. \\"Danton had been a traitor from the beginning of the Revolution and the emergency law voted to stifle his resounding voice make this one of the blackest moments in the whole history of the Revolution.\\"A People's History of the French Revolution by √âric Hazan, p. 361-362, 19N. Hampson (1878) Danton, p. 72-73, 163 The defendants, of whom nine were d√©put√©s of the convention, were removed from the room before the verdict was delivered. Fouquier-Tinville asked the tribunal to order the defendants who \\"confused the hearing\\" and insulted \\"National Justice\\" to the guillotine. Desmoulins struggled to accept his fate and accused Robespierre, the Committee of General Security and the Revolutionary Tribunal. He was dragged up the scaffold by force. On the last day of their trial Lucile Desmoulins was imprisoned. She was accused of organizing a revolt against the patriots and the tribunal to free her husband and Danton. She admitted to having warned the prisoners of a course of events as in September 1792, and that it was her duty to revolt against it. Remarkably Robespierre was not only their eldest friend but also witnessed at their marriage in December 1790, together with P√©tion and Brissot.Jean-Joseph Gaume (1856) La R√©volution, recherches historiques, Quatri√®me partie, Paris, Gaume fr√®res, pp. 136‚Äì37 On 1 April Lazare Carnot proposed the provisional executive council of six ministers be suppressed and the ministries be replaced by twelve Committees reporting to the Committee of Public Safety. The proposal was unanimously adopted by the National Convention and set up by Martial Herman on 8 April. When Barras and Fr√©ron paid a visit to Robespierre, they were received extremely unfriendly. (Robespierre was without the spectacles he usually wore in public.) At the request of Robespierre, the Convention orders the transfer of the ashes of Jean-Jacques Rousseau to the Panth√©on. On 16 April, it was decreed to centralize the investigation of court records and to bring all the political suspects in France to the Revolutionary Tribunal to Paris; the two committees received the power to interrogate them immediately. Foreigners were no longer allowed to travel through France or visit a Jacobin club. On 22 April Malesherbes, a lawyer who had defended the king and the deput√©s Isaac Ren√© Guy le Chapelier and Jacques Guillaume Thouret, four times elected president of the Constituent Assembly were taken to the scaffold. On 23 April a General Police Bureau was set up, independent of the Committee of General Security, tasked with gathering information and mostly report directly to Robespierre.The French Revolution: From Enlightenment to Tyranny by Ian Davidson, p. xiv Robespierre took over the running and expanded its remit within a week when Saint-Just left Paris for the army in the north. On 5 June Fran√ßois Hanriot ordered to detain every baker in Paris who sold his bread to people without (distribution) card or from another section.Le republicain francais, 8 juin 1794; Mercure universel, 24 juin 1794 On 10 June Georges Couthon introduced the drastic Law of 22 Prairial. The Tribunal became a simple court of condemnation refusing suspects the right of counsel and allowing only one of two verdicts ‚Äì complete acquittal or death and that based not on evidence but on the moral conviction of the jurors.Gazette nationale ou le Moniteur universel, 11 juin 1794, p. 4 The courtroom was renovated to allow sixty people to be sentenced simultaneously. The guillotine was moved to the Faubourg Saint-Antoine in order to stand out less. The amount of death sentences doubled. Within three days, 156 people were sent in batches to the guillotine; all the members of Parliament of Toulouse were executed.Geschichte Der Franz√∂sischen Revolution von Jules Michelet, p. 119 The commune had to solve serious problems on the cemeteries because of the smell. Mid-July two new mass graves were dug at Picpus Cemetery in the impermeable ground. Abolition of slavery Throughout the Revolution, Robespierre (at times ambivalently and at others outspokenly) opposed slavery on French soil or in French territories and he played an important role in abolishing it. On 12 May the National Assembly gave citizenship to mulattos, but the colonial whites refused to implement the decree.I. Davidson, p. 81 Robespierre argued passionately in the National Assembly against the Colonial Committee, dominated by slaveholders in the Caribbean. The colonial lobby declared that political rights for Black people would cause France to lose her colonies. Robespierre responded, \\"We should not compromise the interests humanity holds most dear, the sacred rights of a significant number of our fellow citizens,\\" later shouting, \\"Death to the colonies!\\" Robespierre was furious that the assembly gave \\"constitutional sanction to slavery in the colonies,\\" and argued for equal political rights regardless of skin colour. Robespierre did not argue for slavery's immediate abolition, but slavery advocates in France regarded Robespierre as a \\"bloodthirsty innovator\\" and a traitor plotting to give French colonies to England. Only months later, hundreds of thousands of slaves in St Domingue led a revolution against slavery and colonial rule. In the following years, the slaves of St. Domingue effectively liberated themselves and formed an army to oppose re-enslavement. Robespierre denounced the slave trade in a speech before the Convention in April 1793 about Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1793 On June 4, 1793, a delegation of sans-culottes and men of color, led by Chaumette, presented to the convention a petition requesting the general freedom of the Blacks in the colonies. On 6 July Marat was elected to the board of the colonial Convention.[Jean-Daniel Piquet, ¬´ Robespierre et la libert√© des noirs en l‚Äôan II d‚Äôapr√®s les archives des comit√©s et les papiers de la commission Courtois ¬ª, Annales historiques de la R√©volution fran√ßaise [En ligne], 323  janvier-mars 2001, mis en ligne le 16 mars 2006, consult√© le 01 octobre 2020. URL : http://journals.openedition.org/ahrf/1822 ; DOI : https://doi.org/10.4000/ahrf.1822] The radical 1793 constitution supported by Robespierre and the Montagnards, which was ratified by a national referendum, granted universal suffrage to French men and explicitly condemned slavery. However, the French Constitution of 1793 was never implemented. On 17 November 1793, Robespierre insulted the people who denied the existence of the French republic, calling them imbeciles, the deputies from the Gironde, calling them pygmies,Journal des d√©bats et des d√©crets, 22 novembre 1793, p. 24; Le Moniteur Universelle, 20 novembre 1793 and criticized the former Governor of Saint-Domingue L√©ger-F√©licit√© Sonthonax and √âtienne Polverel, who had freed slaves on Ha√Øti, but then proposed to arm them. Robespierre denounced the French minister to the newly formed United States, Edmond-Charles Gen√™t, who had sided with Sonthonax, and informed the Committee not to count on the whites to manage the colony.L'√©mancipation des noirs dans la r√©volution fran√ßaise: 1789-1795 by Jean-Daniel Piquet, p. 287, 292, 303, 409 By 1794, French debates concerning slavery reached their apogee. The discussions focused on the question if the colonies had to impose the same laws as in France. In late January, a small delegation of mixed color, representing the slaveholders, their opponents, as well as a former slave arrived in France. After being briefly imprisoned, the member opposing slavery was freed on the orders of the Committee of Public Safety. The National Convention then passed a decree banning slavery on 4 February and examine the behavior of Sonthonax and Polverel.Journal des d√©bats et des d√©crets, 17 Pluvi√¥se 1794, p. 239 On the day after the emancipation decree, Robespierre delivered a speech in the Convention arguing that terror and virtue were necessary. He praised the French as the first to \\"summon all men to equality and liberty, and their full rights as citizens,\\" using the word slavery twice but without specifically mentioning the French colonies. Despite petitions from the slaveholding delegation, the Convention decided to endorse the decree in full. However, the decree was only implemented and applied in Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe and French Guyane. Several weeks later, in a speech before the Committee of Public Safety, Robespierre linked the cruelty of slavery with serfdom: He attended a meeting of the Jacobin club in June 1794 to support a decree ending slavery, and later signed orders to ratify it. The decree led to a surge in popularity for the Republic among Black people in St-Domingue, most of whom had already freed themselves and were seeking military alliances to guarantee their freedom. Cult of the Supreme Being Stage of the Festival of the Supreme Being (8 June 1794) The Festival of the Supreme Being, by Pierre-Antoine Demachy (1794) Robespierre's desire for revolutionary change was not limited only to the political realm. He also opposed the Catholic Church and the pope, particularly their policy of clerical celibacy. Having denounced the Cult of Reason and other perceived excesses of dechristianization undertaken by political opponents in France, he sought to instil a spiritual resurgence across the nation predicated on Deist beliefs. On 6 May 1794 Robespierre announced to the Convention that in the name of the French people, the Committee of Public Safety had decided to recognize the existence of God and the immortality of the human soul. Accordingly, on 7 May, Robespierre delivered a long presentation to the Convention ‚Äòon the relation of religious and moral ideas to republican principles, and on national festivals‚Äô. Robespierre supported a decree that the Convention passed to establish an official state religion called the Cult of the Supreme Being. The notion of the Supreme Being was based on the creed of the Savoy chaplain that Jean- Jacques Rousseau had outlined in Book IV of Emile. In the afternoon of 8 June (also the Christian holiday of Pentecost) a \\"Festival of the Supreme Being\\" was held. Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony. The ominous and symbolic guillotine had been moved to the original standing place of the Bastille. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with their babies were specifically invited to walk in the procession which started at the Tuileries. (Joachim Vilate had invited Robespierre to have lunch in the Pavillon de Flore, but he ate little.) The festival was also Robespierre's first appearance in the public eye as a leader for the people, and also as president of the convention, to which he had been elected only four days earlier. Witnesses state that throughout the \\"Festival of the Supreme Being\\", Robespierre beamed with joy. He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession. According to Michelet: \\"Robespierre, as usual, walked quickly, with an agitated air. The Convention did not move nearly so fast. The leaders, perhaps maliciously and out of perfidious deference, remained well behind him, thereby isolating him.\\"Michelet, J. The History of the French Revolution (Charles Cocks, trans., 1847 online. The procession ended on the Champ de Mars. The Convention climbed to the summit, where a liberty tree had been planted. (The choirs were composed by √âtienne-Nicolas M√©hul and Fran√ßois-Joseph Gossec, with lyrics from the obscure poet Th√©odore D√©sorgues.) Robespierre delivered two speeches in which he emphasized his concept of a Supreme Being: > Is it not He whose immortal hand, engraving on the heart of man the code of > justice and equality, has written there the death sentence of tyrants? Is it > not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all > peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour > the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, > to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, > pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood. He created the universe > to proclaim His power. He created men to help each other, to love each other > mutually, and to attain to happiness by the way of virtue. Robespierre came down the mountain in a way that resembled Moses as the leader of the people. To offset his small stature (5‚Äô3\\" = 160 cm), he wore elevated shoes with silver buckles. While for some it was exciting to see him at his finest, other deputies agreed that Robespierre had played too prominent a role. Someone was heard saying, \\"Look at the blackguard; it's not enough for him to be master, he has to be God\\". On 15 June, the president of the Committee of General Security Vadier on behalf of the two committees presented a report on a new conspiracy by Catherine Th√©ot, Christophe Antoine Gerle and three others. He insinuated that Robespierre fitted her prophecies. His speech caused much laughter in the convention. Robespierre felt ridiculed and demanded on the 26th that the investigation of Th√©ot be stopped and Fouquier- Tinville replaced.R.R. Palmer (1970), p. 368 Robespierre with his ‚Äòtyrannical habit of judging‚Äô demanded the heads of nine people, who opposed his republic of virtue. According to Madame de Sta√´l, it was from that time he was lost.G. Rud√© (1967) Robespierre, p. 127 Downfall The Committee of General Security was located in H√¥tel de Brionne on the right; it gathered on the first floor. (The Tuileries Palace, which housed the convention, is on the left) On 9 Thermidor Tallien threatened in the convention to use his dagger if the National Convention had not the courage to order the arrest of Robespierre. Collot d'Herbois The Fall of Robespierre in the convention on 27 July 1794 On 20 May, Robespierre personally signed the warrant for Theresa Cabarrus' arrest. Never did Robespierre pursue a victim more remorselessly.L. Moore, p. 287 On 23 May, C√©cile Renault was arrested after having approached Robespierre's residence with two penknives and a change of underwear in her bag. She said the fresh linen was for her execution.A Peoples' History 1793 ‚Äì 1844 from the newspapers. The Bombay Courier, Sat 18th Oct. 1794 Dressed in a red smock she was executed together with her parents (and 52 others) one week later. Robespierre refused to reunite husbands, wives and children dispersed in different prisons in a common detention house.Walter, G. (1961) Robespierre, p. 113. In: L‚Äô≈ìuvre, vol. II, part III. Gallimard. He used this assassination attempt against him as a pretext for scapegoating the British. On 10 June, the Law of 22 Prairial was introduced without consultation from the Committee of General Security, which deepened the conflict between the two committees. It doubled the number of executions; the so-called \\"Great Terror\\" had begun. Collot d'Herbois, Fouch√© and Tallien feared for their lives, due to the excesses carried out by them in various regions of France to stamp out opposition to the revolutionary government.Jean Jaur√®s, \\"The Law of Prairial and the Great Terror (Fall, year IV)\\", in Socialist History of the French Revolution (translated by Mitchell Abidor), Marxists.org Almost all the deputies agreed it had become dangerous. On 11 June Robespierre attacked Fouch√©, accusing him of leading a conspiracy. On 24 June Carnot foresightedly despatched a large part of the Parisian artillery to the front.Lazare Carnot, republican patriot, by Huntley Dupre, p. 185-187 Meanwhile the Austrian Netherlands were almost entirely occupied. At the end of June, Saint-Just arrived in Paris and discovered that Robespierre's political position had degraded significantly. Carnot and Cambon proposed to end the terror. Carnot described Saint-Just and Robespierre as \\"ridiculous dictators\\". On 1 July, Robespierre spoke in the Jacobin club: \\"In London, I am denounced to the French army as a dictator; the same slanders have been repeated in Paris.\\" On 3 July he left the Committee slamming the door and shouting \\"Then save the country without me\\".Petites Chroniques #14 : La R√©volution fran√ßaise ‚Äî 1790 √† 1794 ..., Band 14 He attacked Tallien and had him excluded from the Jacobins on 11 July. On 14 July Robespierre had Fouch√© expelled. To evade arrest, which usually took place during the night, about fifty deputies avoided staying at home. To escape the heat it seems he occasionally went to Maisons-Alfort, 12 km outside of Paris, and stayed on a farm, owned by Fran√ßois-Pierre Deschamps, his courrier. Robespierre walked through the fields or along the Marne, perhaps with his dog. On 22 and 23 July, the two committees met in a plenary session. Both committees were responsible for suppressing counterrevolution but ended targeting each other. Saint-Just declared in negotiations with Bar√®re that he was prepared to make concessions on the subordinate position of the Committee of General Security.Albert Soboul (1974) The French Revolution, 1787‚Äì1799: From the Storming of the Bastille to Napoleon, pp. ? Couthon agreed to more cooperation between the two committees. For Robespierre, the Committee of General Security had to remain subordinate to the Committee of Public Safety. He wanted to take away the authority of the Committee of General Security. On 23 July the Commune published a new maximum, limiting the wages of employees (in some cases by half) and provoking a sharp protest in the sections.Rude, George (1967) The crowd in the French Revolution, p. 136.

Robespierre decided to make himself clear in a new report, hoping to be reelected in the Committee of Public Safety for another year. On Saturday 26 July, Robespierre reappeared at the convention and delivered a two-hour-long speech on the villainous factions. Dressed in the same sky-blue coat and nankeen trousers which he had worn on the proclamation of the Supreme Being, he defended himself against charges of dictatorship and tyranny and then proceeded to warn of a conspiracy against the Committee of Public Safety. Calumny, he charged, had forced him to retire for a time from the Committee of Public Safety; he found himself the most unhappy of men. He gave the impression that no one was his friend, that no one could be trusted.R.R. Palmer, p. 373 He complained of being blamed for everything; and that not only England but also members of the Committee of General Security were involved in intrigue to bring him down. (When he was interrupted Robespierre accused the Convention of limiting the freedom of speech; Billaud Varennes replied they all wanted that.Gazette nationale ou le Moniteur universel 27 July 1794) Specifically, he railed against the bloody excesses he had observed during the Terror. \\"I'm made to fight crime, not to govern it\\", he exclaimed.C√©cile Obligi (2016) La l√©gende noire de Robespierre Intoxicated with his virtue, Robespierre announced a new wave of purification. \\"Punish the traitors, purge the bureau of the Committee of General Security, purge the Committee itself, and subordinate it to the Committee of Public Safety, purge the Committee of Public Safety itself and create a unified government under the supreme authority of the Convention\\". When called upon to name those whom he accused, he simply refused. Joseph Cambon flew to the rostrum. \\"One man paralyzes the will of the National Convention\\". His vehemence changed the course of the debate.Davidson, Ian. The French Revolution, p. 228 The Convention decided not to have the text printed, as Robespierre's speech had first to be submitted to the two committees. It contained matters sufficiently weighty that it needed to first be examined.Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 175, 183 Robespierre was surprised that his speech would be sent to the very deputies he had intended to sue. In the evening, Robespierre delivered the same speech, which he regarded as his last will, at the Jacobin Club, where it was very well received. He spoke of drinking hemlock, and David, the painter, cried out: \\"I will drink it with you.\\" Collot d'Herbois and Billaud-Varenne were driven out because of their opposition to the printing and distribution of the text. Billaud managed to escape before he was assaulted, but Collot d'Herbois was knocked down. They set off to the Committee of Public Safety, where they found Saint-Just working. They asked him if he was drawing up their bill of indictment. Saint-Just promised to show them his speech before the session began.R.R. Palmer (1970), p. 375 Gathering in secret, nine members of the two committees decided that it was all or nothing; after exactly one year in power Robespierre had to be voted off. Barras said they would all die if Robespierre did not. (The Convention lost 144 delegates in 13 months; 67 were executed, committed suicide, or died in prison.) Now extremists and indulgents joined against him. Laurent Lecointre was the instigator of the coup, assisted by Bar√®re, Fr√©ron, Barras, Tallien, Thuriot, Courtois, Rov√®re, Garnier de l‚ÄôAube and Guffroy. (Fouch√© was no longer involved and had hidden.G. Rud√© (1967) Robespierre, p. 110) Each one of them prepared his part in the attack. They decided that Hanriot, his aides-de- camp, Lavalette and Boulanger,Cobb, Richard, The people's armies: the arm√©es r√©volutionnaires: instrument of the Terror in the departments, April 1793 to Flor√©al Year II, trans.

Google Scholar the public prosecutor Dumas, the family Duplay and the printer Charles-L√©opold Nicolas had to be arrested first, so Robespierre would be without support. At noon, Saint-Just went straight to the convention, prepared to blame everything on Billaud, Collot d'Herbois and Carnot. He began: \\"I am from no faction; I will contend against them all.\\" After a few minutes, Tallien ‚Äî having a double reason for desiring Robespierre's end, as, on the evening before, Robespierre refused to release Theresa Cabarrus ‚Äî interrupted him and began the attack. \\"Yesterday a member of the government was left quite isolated and made a speech in his own name; today another one has done the same thing.\\" He continued \\"Yesterday, the president of the revolutionary tribunal [Dumas] openly proposed to the Jacobins that they should drive all impure men from the Convention.\\" Billaud-Varennes complained about how he was treated in the Jacobin club on the evening before and that Saint-Just had not kept his promise the show his speech before the meeting. Since March they had organized a spy system among the representatives in the Convention whom they wanted to destroy. He better stop talking about justice and virtue. Billaud would use his dagger if Robespierre was not arrested.Le Moniteur, 29 July 1794 Tallien demanded the arrest of Dumas, Hanriot and Boulanger. According to Bar√®re, the committees asked themselves why there still existed a military regime in Paris; why all these permanent commanders, with staffs, and immense armed forces? The committees have thought it best to restore to the National Guard its democratic organization.Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 190‚Äì191, 195, 196 As the accusations began to pile up, Saint-Just remained silent. Robespierre rushed toward the rostrum, appealed to the Plain to defend him against the Montagnards, but his voice was shouted down. Robespierre rushed to the benches of the Left but someone cried: \\"Get away from here; Condorcet used to sit here\\". He soon found himself at a loss for words after Vadier gave a mocking impression of him referring to the discovery of a letter under the mattress of the illiterate Catherine Th√©ot. When Garnier witnessed Robespierre's inability to respond, he shouted, \\"The blood of Danton chokes him!\\" Robespierre then finally regained his voice to reply with his one recorded statement of the morning, a demand to know why he was now being blamed for the other man's death: \\"Is it Danton you regret? ... Cowards! Why didn't you defend him?\\"Korngold, Ralph 1941, p. 365, Robespierre and the Fourth Estate Retrieved 27 July 2014 =Arrest= Saint-Just and Robespierre at the H√¥tel de Ville on the night of 9 to 10 Thermidor Year II.

The whole Convention agreed including the two other members of the triumvirate, Couthon and Saint-Just. Le Bas decided to join Saint-Just. Robespierre shouted that the revolution was lost when he descended the tribune. The five deputies were taken to the Committee of General Security and questioned. At around 3 p.m. Hanriot was ordered to appear in the convention; he or someone else suggested to only show up accompanied by a crowd. (Dumas was already arrested at noon and at four taken to Sainte-P√©lagie Prison, as well as members of the family Duplay.Ratineau Fabienne. Les livres de Robespierre au 9 thermidor.

La Garde nationale (Folio Histoire) (French Edition). Editions Gallimard. What had happened was not very clear to their officers; either the convention was closed down or the Paris Commune. Nobody explained anything. The Paris Commune ordered to close the gates (and to ring the tocsin) and summoned an immediate meeting of the sections to consider the dangers threatening the fatherland.Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 212 For the Convention that was an illegal action without permission of the two committees. It was decreed that anyone leading an \\"armed force\\" against the convention would be regarded as an outlaw. At around 7 p.m. the five deputies were taken in a cab to different prisons. Robespierre to the Palais du Luxembourg, Couthon to \\"La Bourbe\\" and Saint-Just to the \\"√âcossais\\". Augustin was taken from Prison Saint-Lazare to La Force Prison, like Le Bas who was refused at the Conciergerie. The Paris Commune was in league with the Jacobins to bring off an insurrection, asking them to send over reinforcements from the galleries, ‚Äòeven the women who are regulars there‚Äô. At some time Hanriot appeared at the Place du Carrousel in front of the convention but he was taken prisoner. According to Eric Hazan: \\"Now came the turning-point of this journ√©e: instead of taking advantage of its superiority, in both guns and men, to invade the nearby hall where the Convention was sitting, the column, lacking orders or leaders, returned to the Maison-Commune.\\" After 9 p.m. the vice-president of the Tribunal Coffinhal went to Committee of General Security with 3,000 men and their artillery.Fouche & Robespierre, le 9 thermidor by Arnaud Louis Raoul Comte de Martel, p. 238-239 As Robespierre and his allies had been taken to a prison in the meantime he succeeded only in freeing Hanriot and his adjutants.Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 235 How the five deputies escaped from prison was disputed. According to Le Moniteur Universel the jailers refused to follow the order of arrest, taken by the convention.Gazette nationale ou le Moniteur universel 30 July 1794 According to Courtois, and Fouquier-Tinville the police administration was responsible for any in custody or release.Fouquier-Tinville, p. 117 Nothing could be done without an order of the mayor.Gazette nationale ou le Moniteur universel 16 August 1794, p. 4 Escorted by two municipals Robespierre the younger was the first to arrive at the town hall. An administrator of the police, who happened to be at the Luxembourg palace took Robespierre the older around 8 p.m. to the police administration on √éle de la Cit√©; Robespierre insisted being received in a prison.Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 223 He hesitated for legal reasons for possibly two hours. At around 10 p.m. the mayor appointed a delegation to go and convince Robespierre to join the Commune movement. Robespierre was taken to the town hall. At around 11 p.m. Saint-Just was delivered, after which Le Bas and Dumas were brought in. (Couthon arrived as the last one in the town hall, but after midnight.E. Hamel, p. 333Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 219) The Convention declared the five deputies (plus the supporting members) to be outlaws. It then appointed Barras and ordered troops (4,000 men) to be called out. After a whole evening spent waiting in vain for action by the Commune, losing time in fruitless deliberation, without supplies or instructions, the armed sections began to disperse. According to Colin Jones apathy prevailed with most of them drifting back to their homes. Around 400 men from three sections seem to have stayed on the Place de Gr√®ve according to Courtois. At around 2 a.m. Barras and Bourdon accompanied by several members of the Convention arrived in two columns. Barras deliberately advanced slowly, in the hope of avoiding conflict by a display of force.Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 225 Then Grenadiers burst into the H√¥tel de Ville; 51 insurgents were gathering on the first floor. Robespierre and his allies had withdrawn in the smaller \\"secr√©tariat\\". There are many stories what happened then. Le Bas killed himself with a pistol, handing another to Robespierre, who shot himself in the jaw.R.R. Palmer (1970), p. 379 According to Barras and Courtois Robespierre tried to commit suicide,Edme Bonaventure COURTOIS, Rapport fait au nom des comit√©s de Salut public et de S√ªret√© g√©n√©rale sur les √©v√©nements du 9 thermidor an II ..., Paris, imprimerie nationale, an IV, p. 202L.

According to Bourdon the soldier M√©da wounded Robespierre from a short distance and then succeeded hitting Couthon's helper in his leg.Pr√©cis historique in√©dit des √©v√©nemens de la soir√©e du 9 Thermidor An II by Charles- Andr√© M√©da, p. 384-385L.

Hamel, pp. 337‚Äì38 Couthon was found lying at the bottom of a staircase in a corner, having fallen from the back of his gendarme. In order to avoid capture, Augustin Robespierre took off his shoes and jumped from a broad cornice.Arrest of Robespierre by G. Lenotre (Th√©odore Gosselin) He landed on some bayonets resulting in a pelvic fracture and several serious head contusions, in an alarming state of \\"weakness and anxiety\\". The unperturbed Saint-Just gave himself up without a word. According to M√©da Hanriot tried to escape by a concealed staircase to the third floor.C.A. M√©da, p. 385 Most sources say that Hanriot was thrown out of a window by Coffinhal after being accused of the disaster. (According to Ernest Hamel it is one of the many legends spread by Bar√®re.E. Hamel, p. 342) Anyhow, Hanriot landed in a small courtyard on a heap of glass. He had strength enough to crawl into a drain where he was found twelve hours later and taken to the Conciergerie. Coffinhal who succeeded escaping was arrested seven days later, totally exhausted. =Execution= Lying on a table, wounded, in a room of the convention, Robespierre is the object of the curiosity and quips of Thermidorians, painting by Lucien-√âtienne M√©lingue (Salon de 1877)(Mus√©e de la R√©volution fran√ßaise) Robespierre on the day of his execution; Sketch by Jacques Louis David socket when he was arrested. For the remainder of the night, Robespierre was laid in an antechamber of the Committee of General Security. He lay on the table with his head on a deal (pine) box, bleeding profusely. At 5 a.m. his brother and Couthon seem to have been taken to the nearest hospital, H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris, to see a doctor. Barras denied that Robespierre was sent there too; the circumstances did not permit it.Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 227 A military doctor was invited and removed some of his teeth and fragments of his broken jaw. Robespierre was then placed in the cell in the Conciergerie and deposited on the bed in which Danton had slept while detained. In the afternoon of 10 Thermidor (28 July, a d√©cadi, a day of rest and festivity) the Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Robespierre and 21 \\"Robespierrists\\" (his followers or supporters among which 13 members of the insurrectionary Commune) to death by the rules of the law of 22 Prairial, only verifying their identity at the trial. Halfway through the proceedings, Fouquier-Tinville, who did not want to pass judgment on his friend the mayor Fleuriot-Lescot, took off his official robe.Fouquier-Tinville, pp. 120‚Äì22 In the late afternoon, the convicts, whose average age was 34, were taken in three carts to the Place de la R√©volution to be executed along with the cobbler Antoine Simon, the jailer of the Dauphin. A mob screaming curses followed them right up to the scaffold. His face still swollen, Robespierre kept his eyes closed throughout the procession. He was the tenth called to the platform and ascended the steps of the scaffold unassisted. When clearing Robespierre's neck, executioner Charles-Henri Sanson tore off the bandage that was holding his shattered jaw in place, causing him to produce an agonising scream until the fall of the blade silenced him. Sanson's grandson wrote that while his grandfather did this carefully, Robespierre nevertheless roared like a tiger in response. After he was beheaded, applause and joyous cries arose from the crowd and reportedly persisted for fifteen minutes. Robespierre and his guillotined associates were later buried in a common grave at the newly opened Errancis Cemetery near what is now the Place Prosper-Goubaux. Legacy and memory Though nominally all members of the committee were equal, during the Thermidorian Reaction Robespierre was presented as the most responsible by the surviving protagonists of the Terror, especially by Bertrand Bar√®re, a prominent member of the Plain. The day after his death, Bar√®re described him as the \\"tyrant\\" and \\"the Terror itself\\". On that day about 70 members of the Paris commune (288 or 144 members?) were sent to the guillotine;OCR A Level History: The French Revolution and the rule of Napoleon 1774-1815 by Mike Wells) meanwhile 35 sections congratulated the convention, some marched through the hall.Non-Violence and the French Revolution: Political Demonstrations in Paris ... by Micah Alpaugh, p. 245-246 On Thuriot's proposal, the Revolutionary Tribunal was suspended and replaced by a temporary commission. On 30 July Courtois took in custody Robespierre's books by Corneille, Voltaire, Rousseau, Mably, Locke, Bacon, Pope, articles by Addison and Steele in The Spectator, an English and Italian dictionary, an English grammar and a bible.Ratineau Fabienne.

URL : http://www.laviedesidees.fr/L-epuisement-de-Robespierre.html On 1 August the Law of 22 Prairial was abolished. Mid August Courtois was appointed by the convention to collect evidence against Robespierre, Le Bas and Saint-Just, whose report has a poor reputation, selecting and destroying papers.A Letter from Danton to Marie Antoinette by Carl Becker. In: The American Historical Review, Vol. 27, No. 1 (Oct. 1921), p. 29 Published by: Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Historical Association At the end of the month, Tallien stated that all that the country had just been through was the \\"Terror\\" and that the \\"monster\\" Robespierre, the \\"king\\" of the Revolution, was the orchestrator. In fact, a whole new political mythology was being created. To preach terrorism after Thermidor was to expose oneself to suspicions of Robespierrism, suspicions which above all other had to be avoided. The Robespierre legend grew, or rather two distinct legends, portraying a Robespierre whose irresponsible ambition had led to calamity, and a Robespierre who was an early friend of the proletariat, about to embark on economic revolution when he fell.R.R. Palmer (1970) The Twelve who ruled, p. 383, 395 Robespierre's reputation has gone through several cycles of re- appraisal. His name peaked in the press in the middle of the 19th century, between 1880-1910 and in 1940. On 5 February 1791 Robespierre declared: True religion consists in punishing for the happiness of all, those who disturb society.Walter, G. (1961) Robespierre √† la tribune, p. 225. In: Robespierre, vol. II. L‚Äô≈ìuvre, part IV. Gallimard. The laborious Buchez, a democratic mystic, was producing volumes (forty in all) in which the Incorruptible rose up as the Messiah and sacrificial being of the Revolution.R.R. Palmer (1970) The Twelve who ruled, p. 396 For Jules Michelet, he was the \\"priest Robespierre\\" and for Alphonse Aulard Maximilien was a \\"bigot monomaniac\\" and \\"mystic assassin\\".Annie Duprat, \\" C√©cile Obligi, Robespierre.

URL : http://journals.openedition.org/ahrf/12537 In the 1920s the influential French Marxist Albert Mathiez argued that he was an eloquent spokesman for the poor and oppressed, an enemy of royalist intrigues, a vigilant adversary of dishonest and corrupt politicians, a guardian of the French Republic, an intrepid leader of the French Revolutionary government, and a prophet of a socially responsible state. Fran√ßois Crouzet collected many interesting details from French historians dealing with Robespierre.Fran√ßois Crouzet (1999) Historians and the French Revolution: the case of Maximilien Robespierre, p. 256-261 According to Marcel Gauchet Robespierre confused his private opinion and virtue. By making himself the embodiment of virtue and of total commitment, Robespierre took control of the Revolution in its most radical and bloody phase: the Jacobin republic. His goal in the Terror was to use the guillotine to create what he called a \\"republic of virtue\\", wherein virtue would be combined with terror. > Robespierre's main ideal was to ensure the virtue and sovereignty of the > people. He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the > nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly > fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the > deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his > ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France. He became a > threat to what he had wanted to ensure and the result was his downfall. In 1941 Marc Bloch, a French historian, sighed disillusioned (a year before he decided to join the French Resistance): \\"Robespierrists, anti-robespierrists ... for pity's sake, just tell us who was Robespierre?\\" Soboul argues that Robespierre and Saint-Just \\"were too preoccupied in defeating the interest of the bourgeoisie to give their total support to the sans-culottes, and yet too attentive to the needs of the sans-culottes to get support from the middle class.\\" According to R.R. Palmer: the easiest way to justify Robespierre is to represent the other Revolutionists in an unfavourable or disgraceful light. This was the method used by Robespierre himself.R.R. Palmer (1970) The Twelve who ruled, p. 400 For Peter McPhee, Robespierre's achievements were monumental, but so was the tragedy of his final weeks of indecision. The members of the committee, together with members of the Committee of General Security, were as much responsible for the running of the Terror as Robespierre.\\" They may have exaggerated his role to downplay their own contribution and used him as a scapegoat after his death.Annie Jourdan, ¬´ Robespierre, An Indecisive Revolutionary ¬ª, Books and Ideas, 18 May 2017. . URL : http://www.booksandideas.net/Robespierre-the-Indecisive.html J-C. Martin and McPhee interpret the repression of the revolutionary government as a response to anarchy and popular violence, and not as the assertion of a precise ideology. Martin keeps Tallien responsible for Robespierre's bad reputation, and that the \\"Thermidorians\\" invented the \\"Terror\\" as there is no law that proves its introduction. Many historians neglected Robespierre's attitude towards the French National Guard from July 1789 till August 1792, and promoting civilian armament between July 1792 and 2 June 1793. Within a year, Carnot the minister of war reversed several measures and became the enemy of Saint-Just. Also Bar√®re changed his mind; the voluntary Guards and militant Sans-culottes lost influence quickly. In the Soviet era, Communist historians, following Lenin, portrayed Robespierre as an heroic exemplar of a model Revolutionary.Robert Mayer, \\"Lenin and the Jacobin Identity in Russia\\" Studies in East European Thought 51#2 (1999), pp. 127-154 online Peter McPhee stated in 2015 there is a long line of historians \\"who blame Robespierre for all the less attractive episodes of the Revolution.\\"Peter McPhee, \\"The Robespierre Problem: An Introduction\\" H-France Salon'] Volume 7 (2015), Issue 14, #1 at p. 9. Thus Jonathan Israel is sharply critical of Robespierre for repudiating the true values of the radical Enlightenment. He argues, \\"Jacobin ideology and culture under Robespierre was an obsessive Rousseauiste moral Puritanism steeped in authoritarianism, anti-intellectualism, and xenophobia, and it repudiated free expression, basic human rights, and democracy.\\" He refers to the Girondin deputies Thomas Paine, Condorcet, Daunou, Cloots, Destutt and Abb√© Gregoire denouncing Robespierre's ruthlessness, hypocrisy, dishonesty, lust for power and intellectual mediocrity.The Enlightenment that Failed: Ideas, Revolution, and Democratic Defeat ...by Jonathan I. Israel, 482 According to Hillary Mantel: He could not survive if he trusted nobody, and could not work out who to trust. Colin Haydon and William Doyle report that, \\"Robespierre remains as controversial as ever, two centuries after his death.\\"Colin Haydon and William Doyle, eds. Robespierre (Cambridge University Press, 2006) p.10. James Friguglietti says that the eminent French scholar Georges Lefebvre (1874‚Äì1959) believed Robespierre to be a \\"staunch defender of democracy, determined opponent of foreign war, saviour of the Republic and man of integrity and vision.\\"James Friguglietti, \\"Rehabilitating Robespierre: Albert Mathiez and George Lefebvre as Defenders of the Incorruptible.\\" in Haydon and Doyle, eds. Robespierre, p 217. However the Marxist approach that portrayed him as a hero has largely faded away.Haydon and Doyle, eds. Robespierre, pp 278‚Äì281. Fran√ßois Furet was especially critical of the \\"Marxist line\\" of Albert Soboul .Donald Sutherland, \\"An Assessment of the Writings of Fran√ßois Furet.\\" French Historical Studies (1990) 16#4: 784-791. =Public memorials= Libert√© √âgalit√© Fraternit√©\\".  Street names  Robespierre is one of the few revolutionaries not to have a street named for him in the centre of Paris. At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March√©-Saint-Honor√© ‚ÄòPlace Robespierre‚Äô, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However, in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called ‚ÄòRed belt‚Äô bear his name, e.g. at Montreuil. There is also a Metro station ‚ÄòRobespierre‚Äô on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S√®vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the Popular Front. There are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.  Plaques and monuments  The Soviet Union built two statues of him: one in Leningrad and another in Moscow (the Robespierre Monument). The monument was commissioned by Vladimir Lenin, who referred to Robespierre as a Bolshevik before his time. Due to the poor construction of the monument (it was made of tubes and common concrete), it crumbled within three days of its unveiling and was never replaced. The Robespierre Embankment in Saint-Petersburg across Kresty prison is now called Voskresenskaya Embankment.Vladimir Tatlin, et al. \\"Memorandum from the Visual Arts Section of the People's Commissariat for Enlightenment to the Soviet of People's Commissars: Project for the Organization of Competitions for Monuments to Distinguished Persons (1918).\\" Design Issues (1984): 70-74 online. = Arras = * On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787‚Äì1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen's museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum. * In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa√ßade of the Carrauts‚Äô brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents. * An Art Deco marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former Abbey of Saint-Vaast. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the H√¥tel de Ville. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc√©e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990. = Paris and elsewhere = * Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays‚Äô house, now 398 rue Saint-Honor√©, the other, erected by the Soci√©t√© des √©tudes robespierristes in the Conciergerie. * In 1909, a committee presided over by Ren√© Viviani and Georges Clemenceau proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the Tuileries, but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment. However, Robespierre is recognisable in Fran√ßois-L√©on Sicard‚Äôs marble Altar of the National Convention (1913), originally intended for the gardens of the Tuileries and now in the Panth√©on. * A stone bust by Albert S√©raphin (1949) stands in the square Robespierre, opposite the theatre in Saint-Denis, with the inscription: \\"Maximilien Robespierre l'Incorruptible 1758-1794\\".See Ren√© & Peter van der Krogt, Statues ‚Äì Hither & Thither for photographs: https://statues.vanderkrogt.net/object.php?webpage=ST&record;=frif030 * Charles Correia's 1980s bronze sculptural group at the Coll√®ge Robespierre in √âpinay-sur-Seine depicts him and Louis Antoine de Saint-Just at a table, working on the 1793 Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights.See Seine- Saint-D√©nis Atlas de l‚Äôarchitecture et du patrimoinefor photographs by Agn√®s Paty: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id;_document=1028036 A mural in the school also depicts him.See D√©partement Seine-Saint-D√©nis Atlas de l‚Äôarchitecture et du patrimoine: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id;_document=1028019 * In 1986, Claude-Andr√© Deseine‚Äôs terracotta bust of 1791 was bought for the new Mus√©e de la R√©volution fran√ßaise at Vizille. This returned to public view Robespierre's only surviving contemporary sculpted portrait. A plaster cast of it is displayed at the Conciergerie in Paris, and a bronze cast is in the Place de la R√©volution Fran√ßaise in Montpellier, with bronzes of other figures of the time.See Nella Buscot, sculpteur, Sculptures √† Montpellier: http://www.nella-buscot.com/jardins_montpellier_prf_2.php  Resistance units  In the Second World War, several French Resistance groups took his name: the Robespierre Company in Pau, commanded by Lieutenant Aurin, alias Mar√©chal; the Robespierre Battalion in the Rh√¥ne, under Captain Laplace; and a maquis formed by Marcel Claeys in the Ain.

From the second half of the 1940s, she gradually built up her leading position in the Czech jazz scene. Pr≈Øchov√° was the mother of the renowned Czech-American pianist and composer Jan Hammer.  Biography  Pr≈Øchov√° was born to Czech parents who worked in Ru≈æomberok, Slovakia at that time. She was baptised by the Slovak priest Andrej Hlinka. At the end of 1938, the family was forced to leave Slovakia, and they resided in Prague. Following the Second World War, Pr≈Øchov√° had her first experience with jazz music. At the Filmov√© ≈ænƒõ (Film Harvest Festival) in Zl√≠n she attended the performance of the \\"ensemble of swing stars\\" Elit Club.Dor≈Ø≈æka (2002), p. 429 Among the members of the band was also her future husband, Jan Hammer Sr. She later saw their performances in the Prague palace Metro, where the band played in the \\"swing pub\\" Akvarium. From her youth, she showed a musical talent in singing and Jan Hammer Sr. finally persuaded her to join the band. In 1947, she began to perform in the first Prague jazz club, Pygmalion. The band was renamed Rytmus 47. In the same year she married Hammer. Pygmalion was closed in 1949 and following that Pr≈Øchov√° sang in the legendary Prague dance-hall Lucerna Palace. At the same time she also collaborated with significant Czech jazz instrumentalists Ludƒõk Hulan, Ferdinand Havl√≠k and others.V√≠≈°ek (2006), album notes In the 1950s, Pr≈Øchov√°  as a member of the Karel Krautgartner Orchestra  became one of the most successful participants of the Czechoslovak song competition Hled√°me p√≠sniƒçku pro v≈°edn√≠ den (In Search of a Song for the Weekday). In 1952, she was voted the best Czech jazz woman singer in the poll of the samizdat Boptime. At the beginning of the 1960s, Pr≈Øchov√° continued her concert career together with her husband, the cardiologist and musician Jan Hammer Sr. Their children, Jan and Andrea, occasionally joined them on piano and drums.Dor≈Ø≈æka (2002), p. 430 Their flat became a place of regular jam sessions with fellow musicians. On one of these occasions, in 1965, she invited the American jazz singer and trumpeter Louis Armstrong for dinner, and they jammed together. In 1968, during the dramatic events of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the whole family moved to the United States. Jan Hammer Sr. received a one-year research fellowship in Washington, D.C., and Jan Hammer Jr. began to study at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. Their stay in the USA was entirely legal but the return to the Czechoslovakia brought them considerable problems. Jan Hammer Jr. remained in the United States, but his father's career in medicine was stopped. Andrea was not admitted to study at the Prague Conservatory. The one-year stay in a Western country was too suspicious for Czechoslovak communist regime. Pr≈Øchov√° was affected by communist state too. Although she was allowed to perform in the Prague clubs, she was prevented from making new recordings for more than twenty years. She was forced to find a new band for her performances at clubs and regional jazz festivals. Thus began her co-operation with young exponents of the Czech jazz scene, Emil Viklick√Ω, and later with the pianist Zdenƒõk Zdenƒõk.Dor≈Ø≈æka (2002), p. 431 Jan Hammer Sr. died on 2 May 1989, a few months before the Czechoslovak Velvet Revolution. Pr≈Øchov√° appeared on the stage afterwards, in the 1990s and in the early years of the new millennium. She died on 16 June 2006 in Prague.  Style  Pr≈Øchov√° was one of the pioneers of the Czech jazz singing. Her musical style encompasses various genres from jazz standards and swing to bebop. In the 1950s and 1960s she also influenced the style of the Czech pop music with her specific phrasing and diction. She represents a part of the continuity of the Czech jazz in the second half of the 20th century.Dor≈Ø≈æka (2002), p. 432 In her later years Pr≈Øchov√° rarely changed her repertoire, she is considered an exponent of the \\"classical jazz singing\\". The Czech musicologist Lubom√≠r Dor≈Ø≈æka called her \\"a key person of the Czech jazz singing\\" in one of his specialised jazz publications.Dor≈Ø≈æka (1990), p. 259 Anton√≠n Matzner and Igor Wasserberger compared her to the American jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald in their book Jazzov√© profily (Jazz Profiles).Matzner (1969), p. 133 Pr≈Øchov√° even adopted a part of Fitzgerald's standard repertoire. Pr≈Øchov√° also appeared also in film. In 1951, she played a singer in the crime film V trestn√©m √∫zem√≠ (In the Penalty Area). In 2001, she appeared in the documentary Mil√Ω spoleƒçn√≠k aneb Blues pro Luƒèka Hulana (A pleasant Companion or Blues for Ludƒõk Hulan).

Being 100% compatible with CompactPCI, PICMG 2.30 defines a migration path to the future CompactPCI Serial standard. It defines a fixed rear I/O pin assignment that focuses on modern, fast serial point-to-point connections. The new technology succeeding parallel CompactPCI comprises both CompactPCI Serial and CompactPCI PlusIO. History The CompactPCI standard uses one main bus connector, J1, and defines user I/O pins and a 64-bit extension for the legacy PCI bus on connector J2. J1 and J2 are the only connectors on 3U single Eurocards. The CompactPCI definition for 6U double Eurocards includes additional connectors (J3, J4, J5) for rear I/O. A true rear I/O standard, however, exists only for J3 ‚Äì through the PICMG 2.16 CompactPCI Packet Switching Backplane specificationPICMG 2.16 that defines Ethernet interfaces at the backplane of 6U cards. Fast serial point-to-point connections have become the state-of-the-art technology and are gradually replacing the classic bus architecture in computers. Also, 3U-based systems are very popular because of their small footprint. This is especially true for modular embedded applications, for example in the field of communications. As a result, several manufacturers tried to implement their own rear I/O concepts using the J2 connector, but had no standard to make their J2 pin assignments compatible with other cards. Another approach to realize serial high-speed interfaces were so-called switched fabrics, which used additional switches and bridges to connect to each other. This involved higher costs and still provided solutions that were too specialized to be compatible with each other. The CompactPCI standard as it is does not offer a standardized solution for the kind of modular connectivity requested for the future. The additional PICMG 2.30 CompactPCI PlusIO specification provides this connectivity on the well-known platform of CompactPCI. It stays compatible with but extends the existing standard by a new definition of the rear J2 connector, adding a number of serial interfaces to provide fast and standardized rear I/O also on 3U format. Through these serial point-to-point connections, CompactPCI PlusIO also bridges the gap between parallel CompactPCI and the serial CompactPCI Serial standard. Interfaces PICMG 2.30 CompactPCI PlusIO standardizes the following interfaces at the rear J2 connector: * 4 x PCI Express (one lane each) * 2 x Ethernet 1000BASE-T * 4 x USB 2.0 * 4 x SATA/SAS Backplane Connectors The PICMG 2.30 extension introduces a new J2 connector type on the plug-in board, an Ultra Hard Metric (UHM) connector with virtual coaxial box shielding technology, which reduces crosstalk at high speeds. This connector supports high frequencies of 5 Gbit/s, even when mated with the CompactPCI-standard unshielded 2-mm hard-metric headers. The matching P2 backplane connector remains the same as for CompactPCI, as do the J1/P1 connectors. Compatibility with Legacy CompactPCI and CompactPCI Serial PICMG 2.30 gives the J2 pins a fixed interface functionality. This makes 64-bit bus communication impossible. The new J2 connector type itself is 100% compatible with the legacy one. The J1 bus connector conforms with the CompactPCI definition. In all, CompactPCI PlusIO is 100% compatible with legacy 32-bit CompactPCI in 3U and 6U format (single and double Eurocards). At the same time, its serial rear I/O connectivity and higher-speed connector form a bridge towards future CompactPCI Serial system architecture. Hybrid backplanes support several cards of the three different standards PICMG 2.0, 2.30, and CPCI-S.0.

It is based on the established PICMG 2.0 CompactPCI standard,PICMG 2.0 which uses the parallel PCI bus for communication among a system's card components. In contrast to this, CompactPCI Serial uses only serial point-to-point connections. CompactPCI Serial was officially adopted by the PCI Industrial Computer Manufacturers Group PICMG as PICMG CPCI-S.0 CompactPCI Serial in March 2011. Its mechanical concept is based on the proven standards of IEEE 1101-1-1998IEEE 1101-1-1998, IEEE Standard for Mechanical Core Specifications for Microcomputers Using IEC 60603-2 Connectors and IEEE 1101-10-1996IEEE 1101-10-1996, IEEE Standard for Additional Mechanical Specifications for Microcomputers Using the IEEE 1101.1-1998 Equipment Practice (19\\" technology). CompactPCI Serial includes different connectors that permit very high data rates. The new technology standard succeeding parallel CompactPCI comprises another specification called PICMG 2.30 CompactPCI PlusIO. This is why CompactPCI Serial and CompactPCI PlusIO as a whole were also called CompactPCI Plus. PICMG's first working title of CompactPCI Serial was CPLUS.0. (See also #Compatibility and Migration.) CompactPCI Serial backplanes and chassis are developed by Schroff, Elm–∞, and Pixus Technologies companies, as for the CompactPCI Serial board level electronics ‚Äì they are developed by MEN Mikro Elektronik, Fastwel, EKF, Emerson Embedded Computing, ADLINK, and Kontron. History Fast serial point-to-point connections have become the state-of- the-art technology and are gradually replacing the classic bus architecture in computers. The CompactPCI standard as it is now does not offer a standardized solution for the kind of modular, serial connectivity requested for the future. This is why CompactPCI Serial was defined as the new future standard. It introduces a serial topology while keeping the proven basic concepts of CompactPCI. Star Topology Thanks to modern chipset architecture, the structure of computers is slowly changing from bus-based interconnections between interface controllers to a star topology built up of serial point-to- point connections. CompactPCI Serial incorporates this star architecture: one system slot can control up to eight peripheral slots. Two of these connections can be PCI Express x8 fat pipes. At the same time, CompactPCI Serial does not need bridges, switched fabrics, or special backplanes. The star connection by standard includes PCI Express, SATA/SAS, and USB. Ethernet Full Mesh Architecture CompactPCI Serial can connect a total of nine cards in a system (one system slot, eight peripheral) through a full Ethernet mesh that supports the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard. In this way the new specification is optimized for symmetrical multiprocessing and redundant system topologies. Interfaces The PICMG CPCI-S.0 system slot supports the following interfaces at the backplane connectors: * 8 x PCI Express  6 x4 links  2 x8 links (fat pipes)  2 dedicated I¬≤C high-speed buses for the fat pipes  Optional serial RapidIO * 8 x SATA/SAS  Supported by SGPIO bus (SFF-8485 specification) for hot swapping * 8 x USB 2.0 * 8 x USB 3.0 * 8 x Ethernet 10GBASE-T * Optional hot swap support by one dedicated I¬≤C bus * Optional IPMI support by one dedicated I¬≤C bus The PICMG CPCI-S.0 peripheral slot supports the following interfaces at the backplane connectors: * 1 x PCI Express  Up to 8 lanes per link * 1 x SATA  Supported by a dedicated SGPIO bus (SFF-8485 specification) * 1 x USB 2.0 * 1 x USB 3.0 * Up to 8 Ethernet 10GBASE-T interfaces * Geographical addressing Power Supply of CompactPCI Serial PICMG CPCI-S.0 defines a single 12-V power supply both for system slots and peripheral slots. Backplane Connectors of CompactPCI Serial The PICMG subcommittee drafting the standard has proposed a new, denser backplane connector type with a 2 mm x 1.4 mm pitch that supports higher transfer rates of up to 12 Gbit/s without a need for bridges or switches. It offers up to 184 pin pairs on a 3U board. A major difference compared to CompactPCI is that with CompactPCI Serial the plug connector is on the board, while the receptacle is on the backplane. This approach is intended to make the standard more robust by avoiding twisted pins on the backplane: If a pin fails, only the plug-in board must be exchanged. The system slot of CompactPCI Serial has six connectors: P1 to P6. On peripheral boards only P1 is mandatory, while P2 to P6 are optional. Rear I/O Concept A peripheral CompactPCI Serial slot only has a small connector with 6 rows of contacts for power and signals. The remainder of a 3U single Eurocard is free for user-defined I/O and offers a total of 128 differential contact pairs or 384 contacts. This is significantly more than in 32-bit CompactPCI. 6U double Eurocards provide the entire upper section of the board for user-defined I/O, as do PICMG 2.0 CompactPCI boards of this size. An advantage of the new architecture is that front and rear I/O boards are inserted directly into one another. By contrast to CompactPCI, no midplane or transfer connector is needed here, which reduces costs and increases system flexibility. Compatibility and Migration The mechanical specification of PICMG CPCI-S.0 CompactPCI Serial is 100% compliant with PICMG 2.0 CompactPCI except for its new backplane connectors. Since the two standards have a different topology, there is no direct \\"bus compatibility\\". For this reason, PICMG has also created an extension to CompactPCI: PICMG 2.30 CompactPCI PlusIO. This standard is intended as a migration path from CompactPCI to CompactPCI Serial. It is 100% compatible with CompactPCI but includes a fixed definition of fast serial I/O interfaces at its backplane J2 connector. Also, it has a new J2 connector that is compatible but supports higher data rates compared to CompactPCI. Hybrid backplanes support several cards of the three different standards PICMG 2.0, 2.30, and CPCI-S.0.  CompactPCI Serial Space  In August 2017, PICMG ratified the CompactPCI Serial Space specification CPCI-S.1 R1.0, which provides a highly-ruggedized implementation of CompactPCI Serial. It is used in satellites as the payload controller as well as ground-based control systems.

Yambasu was a Bishop of the United Methodist Church who died in a road accident on August 16, 2020. He was elected Bishop in 2008 and became one of Sierra Leone's \\"most illustrious religious personalities.\\" In 2019 he was instrumental in negotiating a proposed agreement to resolve conflicts in the worldwide church, but because of COVID-19 the proposal had not yet been approved before his death. Early life and career John Yambasu was born in Bo in southern Sierra Leone and received his Secondary education at the Moyamba Boys Secondary school (MBSS) one of the United Methodist (UMC) mission schools in Sierra Leone West Africa. He earned a bachelor's degree in agriculture from Njala University College in Sierra Leone. His Master of Theology degree was completed at Candler School of Theology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia in 1999. Yambasu was ordained a Deacon in the United Methodist Church in 1987, and an Elder in 1990. He served as Associate Pastor at Trinity U.M. Church in Moyamba, acting pastor and circuit minister at Musselman U.M. Church in Freetown, and acting pastor at Mayenkineh U.M. Church in Freetown. These ministries continued during the Sierra Leone civil war of 1991 to 2002. Yambasu also taught in many schools in Sierra Leone, including the denomination's Harford School for Girls in Moyamba, southern Sierra Leone, where he was senior teacher and school chaplain from 1982 to 1990. He was the Director for Christian Education and Youth Ministries of the Sierra Leone Conference (1992‚Äì98). He also founded the Child Rescue Centre in Sierra Leone, serving as its Executive Director, 1999-2000. His work had a particular focus on providing ministry to young people affected by war. Service as Bishop Yambasu was elected Bishop on December 20, 2008, succeeding Joseph C. Humper, who served during 1993-2008. After his election, he said ‚ÄúWhen I get back to Sierra Leone, the first thing I want to do is to engage in the peace-building process. I want to begin building a new relationship with my bishop, whom I am succeeding, and then the two of us will work together to make sure that the whole church is reconciled.‚Äù He became one of Sierra Leone's \\"most illustrious religious personalities.\\" Yambasu provided critical leadership during the deadly 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak that killed more than 11,000 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, and a 2017 landslide that killed hundreds after torrential rains and flooding in Freetown. Long-time friend Rev. Tom Berlin said, ‚ÄúI never trust people who say they are Christians but are sour. John was just the opposite. John‚Äôs joyful spirit would enable us to see the trust he had in the Lord.‚Äù As President of the Council of Churches in Sierra Leone, Bishop Yambasu in 2018 said Sierra Leone is \\"a MESS state‚ÄîMisery and Evil Side by Side.\\" He also implored, ‚ÄúPresident Julius Maada Bio, you diligently served well in the Army where you left an indelible mark. Now as a democratic leader, you must reflect your true color to end impunity and fight corruption for a better society.‚Äù Globally, the UMC struggled for many years to reconcile conflicts over gender, race, sexuality, language, and colonialism. United Methodists can be loosely described as traditionalist, centrist, or progressive on these issues. The most heated conflicts were expressed around LGBTQ inclusion and further amplified approaching the denomination‚Äôs General Conference each four years. Regular conferences in 2012 and 2016 and a special conference in 2019 addressed opposing proposals that each group considered critical for true Christian faith, and each conference brought the denomination closer to schism. A majority of US delegates tended to favor progressive changes to the Book of Discipline, while a minority of US and most African delegates favored reinforcing traditionalist positions. The church is organized in about 40 nations around the world. Bishop Yambasu preaching in 2016 at Portland, Oregon At the 2016 General Conference in Portland Oregon, Yambasu shared his story of growing up poor in Africa. \\"I know through and through what poverty is. I have slept with it, and I have woken up with it. Countless times, I went to bed without food. I have not only experienced poverty, but for almost 10 years, I had to wrestle with it. Today in Sierra Leone, I live side by side with poverty and misery.‚Äù From that context, he declared, ‚ÄúI am totally fed up! I am fed up! We need to engage each other! We need to embrace each other! We need to talk to each other! Red and yellow, black and white, poor and rich, haves and have-nots, gay or straight, bisexual or homosexual, polygamists, we all need to engage one another. We need to shake this place. We need to shake our churches. We need to torment God with our prayers and give us sleepless nights until we can look at each other in the face and say, ‚ÄòWe are brothers and we are sisters.‚Äô‚Äù He concluded with a challenge to the whole church ‚Äúto dismantle the demons of all sorts of inequalities in our world. We are called to do so with passion. But even more so, we must do so with compassion. Therefore, go!‚Äù Yambasu described the 2019 special conference as a ‚Äúcatastrophe‚Äù and a ‚Äúpoor witness of who we are as United Methodists.‚Äù He said he returned to Sierra Leone ‚Äúdevastated.‚Äù American United Methodists had presented a ‚Äúgalaxy of plans, but none of these plans to us seem to provide the answer to the situation.‚Äù That summer, still hoping for a solution, he called a meeting of several bishops from outside the United States and leaders from several advocacy groups. Following his leadership, a small group negotiated with the help of a professional mediator through the remainder of the year, finally agreeing unanimously on a proposal to resolve the major conflicts by restructuring the church through separation. The agreement would allow each part of the Church to remain true to its theological understanding, while recognizing the dignity, equality, integrity, and respect of every person. The agreement was to be presented for possible approval at the next General Conference, originally scheduled for May 2020, until the COVID-19 pandemic interfered. At the date of Yambasu‚Äôs death, the proposal had not yet been approved. Bishop Yambasu was president of the Africa College of Bishops of The United Methodist Church. He had been elected Chancellor of Africa University shortly before his death. Africa University announced the establishment of an endowment for scholarships in memory of Bishop Yambasu, to support at least one student each year in the area of peace, leadership and governance. Personal life and death John Yambasu was married to Millicent Yambasu. They have five children: Rebecca, Adima, John, Emmanuel and Elizabeth. Their daughters Adima, Rebecca, and Elizabeth as well as foster daughter Janet Kalma Thorley each earned degrees from Africa University between 2014 and 2020. On August 16, 2020, while Bishop Yambasu was traveling to preach at the funeral of a retired colleague, an oncoming vehicle collided head-on, killing him and severely injuring his driver. The other driver, Mohamed Allie Saw, was a mechanic taking a Toyota Land Cruiser to be serviced in a garage across town, according to police reports. Saw lost control of the vehicle, which jumped the median and slammed into Yambasu‚Äôs car. Saw was not injured and fled the scene, but members of the Toyota owner's family brought him to police later and he was charged with several offenses. The bishop‚Äôs driver, Abdul T. Kamara, was discharged from hospital to recover at home.

The airfields were used by the United States Army Air Force Fifteenth Air Force as part of the strategic bombardment campaign against Nazi Germany in 1944 and 1945, as well as the Twelfth Air Force, the Royal Air Force and the South African Air Force during the Italian Campaign (1943‚Äì1945). History Before World War II, the Italian Royal Air Force Regia Aeronautica constructed a series of airfields in the Foggia area. They consisted of hard-surfaced runways and taxiways, concrete parking areas and permanent buildings for the support units and barracks. After the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces in September, 1943 these airfields were seized by the German Luftwaffe. While under Axis control, the airfields were heavily bombed by the United States Army Air Force and Royal Air Force in 1943 before being seized by the British Eighth Army in October 1943 during the Italian Campaign. After the area was captured, the facilities were repaired by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (COE) to make them usable for heavy bomber operations by the new Fifteenth Air Force and the Royal Air Force. Weather in southern Italy was much better than in England where the Eighth Air Force was conducting daylight strategic bombing of Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany. Using the Foggia Airfield Complex for strategic bombing missions would allow Allied heavy bombers to attack targets in France, Germany, Austria and the Balkans which were inaccessible from England. In addition to the air forces, Foggia was a major Allied command center for ground forces in southern Italy and naval forces operating in the Adriatic Sea, with numerous headquarters being assigned. In addition to the captured airfields, several temporary and semi- permanent airfields were constructed for operations by both Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Force and RAF units. These airfields, by and large, consisted of grass or Pierced Steel Planking (PSP) runways and parking and dispersal areas, with support structures quickly constructed out of wood or tents, along with (if needed) a temporary steel control tower. Six-man tents were used for billeting, lined up in rows with the orderly room and the mess hall at one end. There was one, dimly lit, light bulb at the center of each tent. The tent floor was grass or more commonly, dirt. Eventually plywood was scavenged for flooring, wooden cots were used for beds, and ubiquitous 55-gallon drums were converted into stoves and other items. As many of these airfields were captured from the Italians and Germans, wrecked enemy aircraft were a common sight, with metal from their fuselages and wings, glass and other useful parts finding their way into the support areas. By mid-1944, about two dozen airfields were in operation in the Foggia area supporting strategic bombing missions; escort missions; tactical fighter operations, reconnaissance and air defense missions. Albert Speer, Hitler's Minister for Armaments, declared: With the end of the war in May 1945, most of the airfields were abandoned and the land returned to the owners, or the Italian government. Today, most of the airfields are long since returned to agriculture, and little or no evidence remains of their use as wartime airfields. A few, however, still exist as commercial airports and one is still used by the Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare). Airfields and units The airfield complex consisted of the following major airfields. In addition, there were numerous axillary landing airstrips not listed. =Amendola Airfield= Amendola Airfield, 1944 Now Amendola Air Base Located approximately 16km northeast of Foggia.

He studied Philosophy, Mathematics, Language and Communication Coach in Enterprises. From 1978-2004 he lived and worked in Fribourg, Switzerland, and also studied philosophy, mathematics, language and Communication Coach in Enterprises, and was member of the Committee of the Art Laboratory Belluard Bollwerk International. Design career His career as a designer started in 1986, with the first construction of a metal furniture's based on recycled materials from the industry. In 1988 he founded the Atelier En-Fer and work with Cristina Lanzos until 1999. In 2004 he transferred the Atelier En-Fer to the old town of Utrecht, The Netherlands. The peculiar characteristic of his work is that the furniture, objects and interiors are based on used materials and reuse former or hidden functions of the recycled materials. The transformations are made with complex materials (industry), but also with cheap trash (packaging). The metamorphose of the materials should be useful and comfortable, surprising and make smile. His projects bring to the houses the sober beauty of industrial objects but simultaneously take profits from their former function: a spring damps weights (banc, office chair), a car seat has a good ergonomics (arm chair, sofa, reception room), a chain tracks and stays flexible (arm chair, bed, couch) and a supermarket trolley rolls and can be pushed together for storage (seat, child car, coat rack). The main topics related to his work are: research recycling and function reuse (studies and constructions re-using functions in new objects), furniture prototypes (authentic materials for personalised use), interior design, international projects (collaboration with designers and artists in Brazil).  Fascination for inventions and industrial materials  As a child he was always drawing and inventing machines and collected a lot of thrown objects. Since this time he has visited scrap yards and factories and collected interesting used materials. Searching for a new life for those objects, he started in 1985 with the construction of furniture prototypes. These principles are also applied for bigger installations: kitchen (Spain, Switzerland), bathroom (Spain), bar (Fribourg), reception (Bern), office (Fribourg), jewellery shop (Zurich), flower shop (Fribourg). Serial production and new row materials - For Chesterfield he developed a recycling ashtray and produced 1001 pieces for sponsored trendy restaurants, bars and concert rooms. Later he started to use also other recycled row materials in combination with metals: rubber, wood, glass and animal bones.

Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as Dihi Panchannagram and Belgachia was one of them.

Designed by Joe Johnston for the movie Star Wars (1977), she has subsequently appeared in The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983), The Force Awakens (2015), The Last Jedi (2017), Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019). The starship, or a similar one, also has a cameo in Revenge of the Sith (2005). Additionally, the Falcon appears in a variety of Star Wars expanded universe materials, including books, comics, and games; James Luceno's novel Millennium Falcon focuses on the titular ship. It also appears in the 2014 animated film The Lego Movie in Lego form, with Billy Dee Williams and Anthony Daniels reprising their roles of Lando Calrissian and C-3PO, and Keith Ferguson voicing Han Solo. Solo: A Star Wars Story depicts the YT-1300 Corellian light freighter being embodied by L3-37 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). The ship is primarily commanded by smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford and Alden Ehrenreich) and his Wookiee first mate, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew and Joonas Suotamo), and was previously owned by gambler con-artist Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams and Donald Glover). Described as being one of the fastest vessels in the Star Wars canon, the Falcon looks like a worn-out junker, but despite her humble origins and shabby exterior, the Millennium Falcon has played a critical role in some of the greatest victories of the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic. Origin and design The ship originally had a more elongated appearance, but this design's similarity to the Eagle Transporters in Space: 1999 prompted Lucas to change the Falcons design. The original model was modified, re-scaled, and used as Princess Leia's ship, Tantive IV. Modelmaker Joe Johnston had about four weeks to redesign the Falcon, and Lucas' only suggestion to Johnston was to \\"think of a flying saucer\\". Johnston did not want to produce a \\"basic flying saucer\\", so he created the offset cockpit, forward cargo mandibles, and rear slot for the engines. It was also said that the shape of the ship was roughly based on a hamburger with an olive-on-the- side cockpit. The design was simple enough to create in the four-week window. Johnston called production of the new Falcon design one of his most intense projects. The sound of the ship traveling through hyperspace comes from two tracks of the engine noise of a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, with one track slightly out of synchronization with the other to introduce a phasing effect. To this, sound designer Ben Burtt added the hum of the cooling fans on the motion-control rig at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM). =Models and sets= Harrison Ford and Peter Mayhew in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon during the making of a scene from the Star Wars Holiday Special Visually, the Millennium Falcon was represented by several models and external and internal sets. For Star Wars, a partial exterior set was constructed and the set dressed as Mos Eisley's Docking Bay 94 and the Death Star hangar. Besides the functional landing gear, an additional support held up the structure and was disguised as a fuel line. The interior set included the starboard ring corridor, the boarding ramp, cockpit access tunnel, gun turret ladder, secret compartments, and the forward hold. The cockpit was constructed as a separate set that could be rocked when the ship was supposed to shake. Several inconsistencies exist between the internal set and the external set, the cockpit access tunnel angle being the most noticeable. The effects models for Star Wars matched the design of the exterior set. The primary model was five feet long and detailed with various kit parts. The ship was represented by a matte painting when Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) sees it for the first time, showing the full upper surface. For the 1997 \\"Special Edition\\", a digital model replaces the effects model in several shots, and is used in a new shot of the Falcon lifting off from Docking Bay 94. For The Empire Strikes Back, a new external set was constructed. In spring 1979, Marcon Fabrications, a heavy engineering firm that served the UK's petrochemical and oil industries, was hired to build a movable full-scale external model capable of \\"moving as if it were about to take off.\\" Built in secrecy under the project code name Magic Roundabout, the company leased the 1930s Western Sunderland Flying Boat hangar in Pembroke Dock, West Wales. The model, which took three months to construct, weighed over , measured in diameter and high, and used compressed air hover pads for up to of hover-height movement around the set. It was then disassembled and shipped to Elstree Studios, Hertfordshire, for filming. Today, the Pembroke Dock museum has an exhibit about the project. Along with the full-size mock-up of the Falcon, a new miniature model was created for Star Wars: Episode V ‚Äì The Empire Strikes Back to allow ILM to film more intricate in-flight rolls and pitches that were not possible with the five- foot model. This model was able to be mounted on a gimbal that allowed ILM to simulate very difficult maneuvers as the ship attempted to outrun Imperial TIE fighters during the asteroid-field-escape scene from the film. The new model, which measured at approximately 32 inches in length, had several surface features that differed from the five-foot model including updated landing gear and different surface greebles. The 32\\" model was the version of the Millennium Falcon most depicted in toys, model kits, and promotional materials for the Star Wars universe prior to the release of The Force Awakens. The model was reused for Star Wars: Episode VI ‚Äì Return of the Jedi. At the end of this production, the model was destroyed. As in Star Wars, the location set was changed around the ship set. The only major design change was to add landing gear where the disguised fuel line had been in Star Wars. As this set included the port side, that gave the set seven landing gears. The internal set was slightly refitted from A New Hope and featured a sliding cockpit door, a larger cargo hold, an additional corridor to port, and an equipment room. The cockpit was rebuilt slightly larger to allow more actors to fit comfortably; shots were apparently slightly cropped in later releases of the film to hide this alteration. Two new interior sets were created that are not shown to connect to the rest of the set: a top hatch that Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) uses to rescue Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and the compartment where Luke rests on a bunk. The effects model from Star Wars was modified to reflect the additional landing gear, and several new models were built, including one roughly the size of a U.S. Quarter Dollar. For the 1997 Special Edition, a CGI model replaced the effects model during the approach and landing on Cloud City. No new models or sets were created for Return of the Jedi. A portion of the full-scale ship was used for a scene cut from the film in which several characters board the Falcon in a sandstorm on Tatooine. In the scene when Han exacts a promise from Lando not to damage the Falcon, the Falcon is represented by a backdrop painting. It is also in a matte painting of the entire hangar bay. The internal and external sets were scrapped after filming on Return of the Jedi ended. The effects models were kept by Lucasfilm and some have been on display from time to time. A digital version of the Falcon appears briefly on Coruscant in Revenge of the Sith (2005). Lucas has confirmed that the ship is the Falcon and not another ship of similar design. A CGI version of the vessel also appears in the Disney attraction Star Tours: The Adventures Continue. On June 3, 2014, TMZ confirmed that the Falcon would return for Star Wars: The Force Awakens when it leaked a photo from the set of the film, showing a full-scale version of the Falcon being built. An effects shot of the Falcon appears in the teaser trailer for The Force Awakens, released on November 28, 2014. This version of the ship is a digital recreationNovember 16, 2015, Let's all nerd out about our Millennium Falcon Star Wars cover Wired.com of the original 1977 five-foot model, with additional detailing reflecting the passage of time. The most noticeable change is the rectangular sensor array above the top hull, which replaces the circular dish from the first three films. Depiction Han Solo won the Millennium Falcon from Lando Calrissian in the card game 'sabacc' several years before the events of the film A New Hope. In Star Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) charter the ship in the Mos Eisley cantina to deliver them, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), and the stolen Death Star plans to Alderaan. When the Falcon is captured by the Death Star, the group conceal themselves in smuggling compartments built into the floor to avoid detection during a search of the ship. Solo later collects his fee for delivering them to the hidden Rebel base and departs under bitter circumstances, but returns to assist Luke in destroying the Death Star. Solo pilots the Falcon, with Chewbacca, Leia, and C-3PO aboard, to elude the Imperial Starfleet in The Empire Strikes Back, wherein they take refuge at Cloud City, where Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) captures Solo. Lando Calrissian helps the others escape and, at the film's end, he departs in the Falcon to track down Solo and his captor, Jabba the Hutt. Calrissian again captains the Falcon during the climax of Return of the Jedi, with Nien Nunb as co-pilot, to destroy the second Death Star. Before the second Death Star is destroyed, Lando accidentally damages the ship by hitting the circular sensor rectenna dish on a random pipe or circuit in the second Death Star. Lando and the others still have success in destroying the Galactic Empire. In Star Wars: The Force Awakens, set some 30 years after Return of the Jedi, the Falcon is in the possession of a scrap dealer named Unkar Plutt on the desert planet Jakku, having been stolen from Solo and Chewbacca some years prior. Scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) and former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) steal the Falcon in order to escape from an attack by the First Order, having been targeted for having the droid BB-8 in their possession. They are captured by a smuggling freighter, which turns out to be piloted by Solo and Chewbacca, who reclaim the Falcon. Forced to escape in the Falcon from an ambush by parties to whom Solo is heavily in debt, Solo reluctantly agrees to help Rey and Finn return BB-8 to the Resistance. After Rey is captured by the First Order, Solo agrees to take Finn in the Falcon to the First Order's new Starkiller Base‚Äîa planet that has been converted into the next generation of 'Death Star'‚Äîby attempting a risky maneuver of bypassing the planet's defences by exiting hyperspace in its atmosphere. When Solo is killed by his son, the rebels escape the destructing Starkiller Base. Later, Rey uses a newly-assembled map to travel to Ahch-To, the site of the first Jedi temple, to make contact with the long- lost Luke Skywalker, travelling in the Falcon in the company of Chewbacca and R2-D2. The Falcon appears again in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, still on Ahch-To with Rey and Chewbacca. Later in the film, Chewbacca and Rey take the Falcon to the planet Crait, where the Resistance is under attack by the First Order. The Falcon loses its sensor dish for the third time on Crait, after it is shot off by a TIE fighter, but still manages to single-handedly take out most of the First Order's fighters on the planet while Luke distracts Kylo Ren. After the battle, surviving Resistance personnel leave Crait aboard the Falcon. In The Last Jedi, Rey uses the Falcons escape pod to board Supreme Leader Snoke's ship. Director Rian Johnson noted that he wanted its design to resemble a coffin, inspired by C.S. Lewis' Perelandra. The escape pod was monogrammed to say \\"Property of Han Solo\\". In the film Solo: A Star Wars Story, it is revealed that Lando modified the Falcon by putting an escape pod between the frontal 'mandibles', which Han jettisons to escape a gravity well. =Kessel Run= In the initial film, Solo brags that the Falcon \\"made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs\\". As the parsec is a unit of distance, not time, different explanations have been provided. In the fourth draft of the script, Kenobi \\"reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation.\\" Lucas acknowledged the misnomer in 1977, saying that Han modified \\"the navigational system to get through hyperspace in the shortest possible distance\\". On the film's DVD audio commentary, Lucas further explained that in the Star Wars universe, traveling through hyperspace requires careful navigation to avoid stars, planets, asteroids, and other obstacles,Commentary track on Star Wars DVD and that because no long-distance journey can be made in a straight line, the \\"fastest\\" ship is the one that can plot the \\"most direct course\\", thereby traveling the least distance. In The Force Awakens, Rey references the Kessel Run but describes it as being completed in fourteen parsecs, after which Solo corrects her. In Solo: A Star Wars Story, Solo's Kessel Run is depicted in detail, providing an explanation for the \\"twelve parsec\\" boast. Solo has to make many calculated jumps to avoid killing the crew. After integrating the memory module of Lando's damaged L3 droid into the ship's navigation, Solo is able to take a \\"shortcut\\" (which is dangerously close to a black hole). Chewbacca indicates the real distance was closer to 13 parsecs, but Solo insists, \\"Not if you round down,\\" implying that the claim of \\"less than twelve parsecs\\" is slightly exaggerated. =Ownership= The Falcon has been depicted many times in the franchise, and its ownership and command have changed several times. * Prior to Star Wars, the Falcon was in the possession of Lando Calrissian. He lost it to Han Solo in payment of a gambling debt. This is depicted in Solo: A Star Wars Story, as well as the integration of Lando's droid L3-37 with the ship's computer. * After the events of The Empire Strikes Back, Leia, Chewbacca and Lando take possession of the Falcon after Solo's hibernation in carbonite and capture by the Empire and Boba Fett. * During Return of the Jedi, Solo leaves Tatooine aboard the Millennium Falcon, and on arrival at the rendezvous for the Rebel fleet he lends the Falcon to Calrissian, who pilots it during the Battle of Endor and the destruction of the second Death Star. * After the events of Return of the Jedi, the Falcon is stolen from Solo, ending up on the planet Jakku under the ownership of a scrap dealer, Unkar Plutt, 30 years after the Battle of Endor. In The Force Awakens, Rey and Finn commandeer the ship to escape the planet, only to be found by Solo and Chewbacca, who immediately reclaim the ship. * After the death of Solo, Rey pilots the Falcon, with Chewbacca as her co-pilot. The novelization of The Force Awakens states that Chewbacca willingly abdicates captaincy of the Falcon to Rey. * After the events of The Last Jedi, the ship becomes the base of operations for the remaining members of the Resistance. * After the events of The Rise of Skywalker the Falcon is again piloted by Lando Calrissian with Chewbacca. Cultural influence Joss Whedon credits the Millennium Falcon as one of his two primary inspirations for his Firefly television show. The Falcon and the Falcon's distinct shape appear in Star Trek: First Contact, Blade Runner, Spaceballs, and Starship Troopers. The manga series Berserk includes a Millennium Falcon arc. SpaceX states that their launch vehicles (except Starship) are named after the Millennium Falcon. =Biology= The middle Cambrian arthropod Cambroraster falcatus is named after the Millennium Falcon =Toys= Hot Wheels Millennium Falcon toy Kenner, Hasbro, Steel Tec, Master Replicas, Code 3 Collectibles and Micro Machines have all released Millennium Falcon toys and puzzles, including a Transformers version of the ship. Hot Wheels has made a model of the ship for their Star Wars starship line and a version of it as a car. It is also available as a Hot Wheels playset. Lego has released multiple versions of the Millennium Falcon in varying sizes. The 5,195-piece Lego model (part of the Star Wars \\"Ultimate Collectors Series\\") was physically the largest Lego set sold by the company, until it was topped in 2008 by the Lego Taj Mahal. In September 2017, Lego released an updated Millennium Falcon set in the Star Wars \\"Ultimate Collectors Series\\". With the new interior and more details compared to the 2007 model, the 7,541-piece model is the largest and most expensive commercially available Lego set. Lego has also made a version of the Falcon to tie in with the Star Wars film, Solo. It is called the Kessel Run Millennium Falcon. Theme park attractions Full size replica at Galaxy's Edge On May 31, 2019, a full sized replica of the Falcon was opened to the public along with the rest of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, along with a flight simulator attraction, Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run, in which riders take control of the Falcon from inside the iconic cockpit. An identical version of the attraction opened on August 29, 2019, at Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. A third incarnation of the attraction has been announced for Walt Disney Studios Park at the Disneyland Paris Resort in Marne-la-Vall√©e, France.

The station was positioned just after the railway crossed Hospital Hill and had two platforms and a brick built station building. History The station was planned as part of the South Eastern Railway's attempt to connect the military base at Shorncliffe with the railway network. A secondary reason was to develop the village of Seabrook as a coastal holiday resort. It was ceremonially opened on 9 October 1874, and opened fully the next day. An extension to was planned, but this was never implemented. By 1910, the station was being served by 15 trains a day from Sandling, with the journey taking around 8 minutes. Being inland of the town it served, the station was never popular and with increased bus traffic cutting the already small passenger numbers, it was closed on April Fool's Day 1931. The station building was demolished a few months after closure and a bus depot was built on the site which operated until 6 September 1980. The station area has since been completely redeveloped with housing.

Although Hungarian kings viewed Bosnia as part of Hungarian Crown Lands, the Banate of Bosnia was a de facto independent state, for most of its existence. It was founded in the mid-12th century and existed until 1377 with interruptions under ≈†ubiƒá family between 1299 and 1324. In 1377 it was elevated to kingdom. The greater part of its history was marked by a religiopolitical controversy revolving around the native Christian Bosnian Church condemned as heretical by the dominant Nicene Christian churches, namely the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox, with the Catholic church being particularly antagonistic and persecuting its members through the Hungarians. Historical background In 1136, B√©la II of Hungary invaded upper Bosnia for the first time and created the title \\"Ban of Bosnia\\", initially only as an honorary title for his grown son Ladislaus II of Hungary. During the 12th century, rulers within the Banate of Bosnia acted increasingly autonomously from Hungary and/or Byzantium. In reality, outside powers had little control of the mountainous and somewhat peripheral regions which made up Bosnian Banate. History = Early history and Kulin = Ban Boriƒá appears as the first known Bosnian ruler in 1154, as an Hungarian vassal, who participated in the Siege of Braniƒçevo as part of the Hungarian King forcesMladen ANƒåIƒÜ, 1997, Putanja klatna.

(1997), Bizantska vlast u Dalmaciji od 1165. do 1180. godine, http://darhiv.ffzg.unizg.hr/id/eprint/6319/#page=18 In 1167 He was involved in offensives against the Byzantines when he provided troops for Hungarian armies War ended with the retreat of Hungarian army in Battle of Sirmium, near Belgrade in 1167. Boriƒá's involvement in the war indicates that Bosnia was part of the Hungarian kingdom at that time. The Hungarians sued for peace on Byzantine terms and recognised the empire‚Äôs control over Bosnia, Dalmatia, Croatia south of the Krka River as well as the Fru≈°ka Gora.. Bosnia was part of Byzantium from 1167 to 1180, but as Bosnia was distant land, rule over it was probably nominal. In the time of emperor Manuel I Komnenos death (1180), Bosnia was governed by Ban Kulin who managed to free it from Byzantine influence through the alliance to Hungarian king B√©la III, and with help of Serbian ruler Stefan Nemanja and his brother Miroslav of Hum, with whom he successfully waged a war in 1183 against the Byzantines. Kulin secured peace, although it continued as a nominal vassal to Hungarian king. but there is no evidence that Hungarians occupied areas of central Bosnia. The Pope emissaries of that time reached to Kulin directly and referred to him as \\"lord of Bosnia\\". Kulin was often referred as \\"veliki ban bosanski\\" (Great Bosnian Ban) by contemporaries, and by his successor Matej Ninoslav. He had a powerful effect on the development of early Bosnian history, under whose rule an age of peace and prosperity existed. In 1189, Ban Kulin issued the first written Bosnian document, now known as the Charter of Ban Kulin, in Bosnian Cyrillic, diplomatic document regarding the trade relations with the city of Ragusa (Dubrovnik). Kulin's rule also marked the start of a controversy involving the indigenous Bosnian Church (a branch of Bogomilism), a Christian sect considered heretical by both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church. Under him, the \\"Bosnian Age of Peace and Prosperity\\" would come to exist. = Heresy and Bilino Polje abjuration = Kulin Ban's plate from 1193, found in Biskupiƒái In 1203, Serbian Grand Prince Vukan Nemanjiƒá accused Kulin of heresy and lodged an official appeal to the pope. At Bilino Polje Kulin signed abjuration stating that he was always a faithful Catholic, and saved Banate of Bosnia from outside intervention. In 1203, Kulin moved to defuse the threat of foreign intervention. A synod was held at his instigation on 6 April. Following the Abjuration of Bilino Polje, Kulin succeeded in keeping the Bosnian Diocese under the Ragusan Archdiocese, thus limiting Hungarian influence. The errors abjured by the Bosnian nobility in Bilino Polje seem to have been errors of practice, stemming from ignorance, rather than heretical doctrines. Kulin also reaffirmed his allegiance to Hungary, but despite this, Hungary's authority remained only nominal. Andrew II in 1225 gave Bosnia to Pope who expected that king as lord of Bosnia do cleaning of heretics but it is transferred to Archbishop Ugrin Cs√°kMladen ANƒåIƒÜ, 1997, Putanja klatna.

Zavod za povijesne znanosti Hrvatske akademije znanosti i umjetnosti u Zadru. https://www.bib.irb.hr/40904#page=60 Hungarian king's ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204. Kulin's policy was poorly continued since the Ban's death in 1204 by his son and heir, Stjepan Kuliniƒá, who seems to have remained aligned with the Catholic Church. Stjepan was eventually deposed in 1232. The Bosnian Church forcibly replaced Kuliniƒá with a nobleman called Matej Ninoslav (1232‚Äì50). This caused bad relations with Serbia as the previous ruler was related to the Nemanjiƒá dynasty.. Around this time, a relative of Ninoslav, Prijezda I, converted back to Catholicism (he previously switched to the Bosnian Church for a short period of time). Ninoslav eventually became a protector of the Bosnian Church. In 1234 Hungarian king Andrew II gave the Banate of Bosnia to Duke Coloman. To make matters worse, the legitimate successor for the Bosnian throne of the Kuliniƒá dynasty, count Sibislav of Usora, son of former Ban Stjepan, started to attack Ninoslav positions, attempting to take Banate for himself. Pope Gregory IX replaced the heretical Bosnian bishop in 1235 with John of Wildeshausen, then Master General of the Dominican Order and later declared a saint, and confirmed Duke Coloman as the new legitimate Ban of Bosnia. = Bosnian Crusade = alt= The Bosnian Crusade led by bishop John and Coloman lasted for five full years. The war only funnelled more support to Ninoslav, as only Sibislav took the Pope's side in the Crusade. Ninoslav issued an edict to the Republic of Ragusa on 22 May 1240, stating that he placed it under his protection in case of an attack by Serbian king Stefan Vladislav. The support from Ragusa was essential to support Matej Ninoslav warfare. The only significant impact the Bosnian Crusade had was augmenting the anti-Hungarian sentiment among the local population, a major factor in politics that contributed to the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia in 1463 and lasted beyond it. It was also a response due to the very bad relations between Bosnia and Serbia, as Serbia sent no aid to Ninoslav contrary to the traditional alliance. Coloman passed the governorship of Bosnian Banate to Ninoslav distant cousin, Prijezda, who only managed to hold it for two or three years. In 1241, the Tatars invaded Hungary, so Coloman had to fall back from Bosnia. Matej Ninoslav immediately retook control, while Prijezda fled to Hungary in exile. King Bela IV was on the retreat which enabled Ninoslav to restore control over most of Bosnia. The Tartars were fought off by the Croats, sending them back across Bosnia, bringing more destruction to the land. The edict to Ragusa was re-issued in March 1244. Ninoslav was involved in the civil war that erupted in Croatia between Trogir and Split, taking Split's side. King Bela IV of Hungary was greatly frustrated and considered this a conspiracy, so he sent a contingent to Bosnia, but Ninoslav subsequently made peace. In 1248, Ninoslav cunningly saved his lands from yet another papal crusade requested by the Hungarian archbishop. The remainder of his reign, Ban Ninoslav Matej dealt with inner matters in Bosnia. His death after 1249, possibly in 1250, brought some conflicts over the throne; as the Bosnian Church desired someone from their own sphere of interest, and the Hungarians side desired someone that they could easily control. Eventually, King Bela IV conquered and pacified Bosnia and succeed in putting Ninoslav 's Catholic cousin Prijezda as the Bosnian Ban. Ban Prijezda ruthlessly persecuted the Bosnian Church. In 1254 the Croatian Ban shortly conquered Zahumlje from Serbian king Stefan Uro≈° I during Hungary's war against Serbia, but peace restored Zahumlje to Serbia. Another Hungarian campaign was launched against Bosnia in 1253, but there was no evidence that they reached the Bosnian Banate. However, Hungary did control northern regions of Usora and Soli through their vassal rulers. Bosnian banate continued to exist as de facto independent entity even after Ninoslav. = Kotromaniƒá dynasty = Prijezda I's realm (founder of Kotromaniƒá dynasty) was significantly smaller than Ninoslav's, the northern regions of Usora and Soli having been detached by the Hungarian crown. In 1284 this contiguous territory was granted to King Ladislaus IV of Hungary's brother-in-law, the deposed Serbian king Dragutin. The same year Prijezda arranged the marriage of his son, Stephen I, with Dragutin's daughter Elizabeth. The marriage had great consequences in the subsequent centuries, when Stephen and Elizabeth's Kotromaniƒá descendants claimed the throne of Serbia. Prijezda was forced to withdraw from the throne in 1287 due to his old age. He spent his last hours on his estate in Zemljenik. Hungarians reasserted their authority over territories as Soli, Usora, Vrbas, Sana in the early 13th century. Territory that Ban Prijezda, a loyal Hungarian vassal, controlled was possibly in northern parts of today's Bosnia between rivers Drina and Bosna. Banate of Bosnia to the south remained independent, but we do not know its rulers, successors of ban Ninoslav. He was inherited by Prijezda II who ruled independently from 1287‚Äì1290, but later together with his brother Stephen I Kotromaniƒá. = Restoration and Expansion = Tvrtko with his mother, brother and cousin Elizabeth at the deathbed of his uncle Stephen, as depicted on the 205x205px During the end of 13th and about first quarter of 14th century, till the Battle of Bliska Bosnian banate was under rule of Croatian bans from ≈†ubiƒá family. After defeat in Battle of Bliska, Mladen II was captured by Charles I who took him to Hungary, which sparked Kotromaniƒá dynasty restoration.Mladen ANƒåIƒÜ, 1997, Putanja klatna.

Zavod za povijesne znanosti Hrvatske akademije znanosti i umjetnosti Zadru.https://www.bib.irb.hr/40904#page=103 Stephen II was the Bosnian Ban from 1314, but in reality from 1322 to 1353 together with his brother, Vladislav Kotromaniƒá in 1326‚Äì1353. By 1326 Ban Stephen II attacked Serbia in a military alliance with the Republic of Ragusa and conquered Zahumlje (or Hum)[25], gaining more of Adriatic Sea coast, from mouth of the Neretva to Konavle, with areas significant Orthodox population under Archbishopric of Ohrid and mixed Orthodox and Catholic population in coastal areas and around Ston. He also expanded into Croatian Zavr≈°je, including the fields of Glamoƒç, Duvno and Livno. Immediately after the death of Serbian King Stefan Uro≈° II Milutin in 1321, he had no problem in acquiring his lands of Usora and Soli, which he fully incorporated in 1324. In 1329, Ban Stephen II Kotromaniƒá pushed another military attempt into Serbia, assaulting Lord Vitomir of Trebinje and Konavle, but the main portion of his force was defeated by the Young King Du≈°an who commanded the forces of King Stefan Deƒçanski at Priboj. The Ban's horse was killed in the battle, and he would have lost his life if his vassal Vuk had not given him his own horse. By doing so, Vuk sacrificed his own life, and was killed by the Serbian troops in open battle. Thus the Ban managed to add Nevesinje and Zagorje to his realm. Throughout his reign in the fourteenth century, Stephen ruled the lands from Sava to the Adriatic and from Cetina to Drina. He doubled the size of his state, and achieved full independence from surrounding countries. Ban Stephen II played Venice and Hungarian kings against each other, slowly ruling more and more independently and soon initiated a conspiracy with some members of the Croatian and Hungarian nobility against his Hungarian liege and father-in-law. In 1346 Zadar finally returned to Venice, and the Hungarian King, seeing that he had lost the war, made peace in 1348. Ban of Croatia Mladen II ≈†ubiƒá was greatly opposed to Stephen II's policy, accusing him of treason and the relations between the two Bans worsened ever afterwards. By 1342 the Franciscan Vicariat of Bosnia was established. During the reign of Stjepan II Kotromaniƒá all three churches (Bosnian Church, Ortodox, Catholic) were active in Bosnian Banate. = Tvrtko I reign = Mo≈°tre Tvrtko, however, was only about fifteen years old at the time, so his father Vladislav governed as regent. Soon after his accession, Tvrtko traveled with his father throughout the realm, to settle relations with his vassals. Jelena ≈†ubiƒá, Tvrtko's mother, replaced Vladislav as regent upon his death in 1354. She immediately traveled to Hungary to obtain consent to Tvrtko's accession from King Louis I, his overlord. Following her return, Jelena held an assembly (stanak) in Mile, with mother and son confirming the possessions and privileges of the noblemen of \\"all of Bosnia, Donji Kraji, Zagorje, and the Hum land\\". At the start of his personal rule the young Ban somehow considerably increased his power. Although he constantly emphasized his subordinance to the King, Tvrtko started regarding the loyalty of the Donji Kraji noblemen to Louis as treachery against himself. In 1363, a conflict broke out between the two men. By April, the Hungarian King had begun amassing an army An army led by Louis himself attacked Donji Kraji, where the nobility was divided in its loyalties between Tvrtko and Louis. A month later an army led by the Palatine of Hungary Nicholas Kont and the Archbishop of Esztergom Nicholas Ap√°ti struck Usora. Vlatko Vukoslaviƒá deserted to Louis and surrendered to him the important fortress of Kljuƒç, but Vukac Hrvatiniƒá succeeded in defending the Soko Grad fortress in the ≈æupa of Pliva, forcing the Hungarians to retreat. In Usora, the Srebrenik Fortress held out against a \\"massive attack\\" by the royal army, which suffered the embarrassment of losing the King's seal. The successful defense of Srebrenik marked Tvrtko's first victory against Hungarian king. The unity of the local magnates waned as soon as the Hungarians were defeated, weakening Tvrtko's position and that of a united Bosnia.alt=The anarchy escalated, and in February the following year, the magnates revolted against Tvrtko and dethroned him. He was replaced by his younger brother Vuk, Tvrtko and Jelena took refuge at the Hungarian royal court, where they were welcomed by Tvrtko's former enemy and overlord, King Louis. Tvrtko returned to Bosnia in March and reestablished control over a part of the country by the end of the month, including the areas of Donji Kraji, Rama (where he then resided), Hum, and Usora. Throughout the following year, Tvrtko forced Vuk southwards, eventually compelling him to flee to Ragusa. Sanko, Vuk's last supporter, submitted to Tvrtko in late summer and was allowed to retain his holdings. Ragusan officials made an effort to procure peace between the feuding brothers, and in 1368, Vuk asked Pope Urban V to intervene with King Louis I on his behalf. Those efforts were futile; but by 1374, Tvrtko had reconciled with Vuk on very generous terms. The death of Du≈°an the Mighty and the accession of his son Uro≈° the Weak, in December 1355, was soon followed by the breakup of the once-powerful and threatening Serbian Empire. It disintegrated into autonomous lordships that, by themselves, could not resist Bosnia. This paved the way for Tvrtko to expand towards the east, but internal problems prevented him from seizing the opportunity immediately. By the mid-14th century, Bosnian banate reached its peak under young ban Tvrtko Kotromaniƒá who came into power in 1353, and had himself crowned on 26 October 1377. Economy  alt= The second Bosnian ruler, Ban Kulin strengthened the country's economy through treaties with Dubrovnik in 1189 and Venice. Charter of Ban Kulin was a trade agreement between Bosnia and the Republic of Ragusa that effectively regulated Ragusan trade rights in Bosnia written on 29 August 1189. It is one of the oldest written state documents in the Balkans and is among the oldest historical documents written in Bosanƒçica.Franz Miklosich, Monumenta Serbica, Viennae, 1858, p. 8-9. The export of metal ores and metalwork (mainly silver, copper and lead) formed the backbone of the Bosnian economy, as these goods along others like wax, silver, gold, honey and rawhide were transported over the Dinaric Alps to the seashore by Via Narenta, where they were bought chiefly by the Republics of Ragusa and Venice. Access to Via Narenta was crucial for Bosnian economy, which was possible only after ban Stephen II managed to took control of the trading route during his conquests of Hum. Main trading centres were Fojnica and Podvisoki. Religion  Bishop of Bosniaalt=315x315px Christian missions emanating from Rome and Constantinople started pushing into the Balkans in the 9th century, Christianizing the South Slavs and establishing boundaries between the ecclesiastical jurisdictions of the See of Rome and the See of Constantinople. The East‚ÄìWest Schism then led to the establishment of Roman Catholicism in Croatia and most of Dalmatia, while Eastern Orthodoxy came to prevail in Serbia. Lying in-between, the mountainous Bosnia was nominally under Rome, but Catholicism never became firmly established due to a weak church organization and poor communications. Medieval Bosnia thus remained a \\"no-man's land between faiths\\" rather than a meeting ground between the two Churches, leading to a unique religious history and the emergence of an \\"independent and somewhat heretical church\\". While Bosnia remained at least nominally Catholic in the High Middle Ages, the Bishop of Bosnia was a local cleric chosen by Bosnians and then sent to the Archbishop of Ragusa solely for ordination. Although the Papacy already insisted on using Latin as the liturgical language, Bosnian Catholics retained Church Slavonic language. The Franciscans order arrived in Bosnia in the later half of the 13th century, aiming to eradicate the teachings of the Bosnian Church. The first Franciscan vicariate in Bosnia was founded in 1339/40. Stephen II Kotromaniƒá was instrumental in establishing of the vicariate. By 1385. they had four monasteries in Olovo, Mile, Kraljeva Sutjeska and La≈°va.

The racial violence was ignited by political, social, and racial tensions following the American Civil War, in the early stages of Reconstruction.Zuczek, Richard (ed.). 2006. Encyclopedia of the Reconstruction Era: Memphis Riot (1866). After a shooting altercation between white policemen and black veterans recently mustered out of the Union Army, mobs of white residents and policemen rampaged through black neighborhoods and the houses of freedmen, attacking and killing black soldiers and civilians and committing many acts of robbery and arson. Federal troops were sent to quell the violence and peace was restored on the third day. A subsequent report by a joint Congressional Committee detailed the carnage, with blacks suffering most of the injuries and deaths by far: 46 black and 2 white people were killed, 75 black people injured, over 100 black persons robbed, 5 black women raped, and 91 homes, 4 churches and 8 schools (every black church and school) burned in the black community.United States Congress, House Select Committee on the Memphis Riots, Memphis Riots and Massacres, 25 July 1866, Washington, DC: Government Printing Office (reprinted by Arno Press, Inc., 1969) Modern estimates place property losses at over $100,000, suffered mostly by black people. Many black people fled the city permanently; by 1870, their population had fallen by one quarter compared to 1865. Public attention following the riots and reports of the atrocities, together with the New Orleans massacre of 1866 in July, strengthened the case made by Radical Republicans in U.S. Congress that more had to be done to protect freedmen in the Southern United States and grant them full rights as citizens.Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866\\" (1977), p. 243. The events influenced passage of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which granted full citizenship to African Americans, as well as the Reconstruction Act, which established military districts and oversight in certain states.Waller, \\"Community, Class, and Race\\" (1984), p. 233. Investigation of the riot suggested specific causes related to competition in the working class for housing, work, and social space: Irish immigrants and their descendants competed with freedmen in all these categories. The white planters wanted to drive freedmen out of Memphis and back to plantations, to support cotton cultivation with their labor. The violence was a way to enforce white supremacy after the end of slavery.Hardwick, \\"Your Old Father Abe Lincoln Is Dead And Damned\\" (1993), p. 123. Quote: \\"The Memphis riot was a brutal episode in the ongoing struggle that continued well past the actual moment of emancipation to establish the boundaries around and possibilities for action by black people. The rioters asserted dominance over black people and attempted to establish limitations on black behavior. Where one cultural code had governed racial interaction under slavery, another, more appropriate to the new black status, had to be established after black people claimed their freedom.\\" Background  The cotton trade collapsed in the first year of the war, precipitating economic problems in West Tennessee. After the capture of Memphis by Union forces in 1862 and occupation of the state, the city became a center for contraband camps and a haven for refugee slaves seeking protection from former masters. In Shelby County and the four adjacent counties around the city, the total slave population in 1860 was 45,000. As escaped and freed slaves migrated to the city, the black population of Memphis increased from 3,000 in 1860 to nearly 20,000 in 1865.Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866\\" (1977), p. 244. The total population of Memphis in 1860 was 22,623 and, while it was growing rapidly, the thousands of black people had a major effect. By 1870 the city totaled 40,226. While some black people lived in the camps, families of the 3rd Artillery, a black unit that had been stationed there, built cabins and shacks. They settled beyond the city limits near Fort Pickering, near what was called South Memphis. Many of their families moved to the same area.Hardwick, \\"Your Old Father Abe Lincoln Is Dead And Damned\\" (1993), p. 112. Quote: \\"Once large numbers of black soldiers came to be stationed at Memphis, members of their families began to settle there as well.\\" Unique among the states because of the long-term military occupation, during the war Tennessee created a kind of de facto Black Code, which depended on the complicity of police, lawyers, judges, jailers, etc.Forehand, \\"Striking Resemblance\\" (1996), pp. 12‚Äì13. Slaveholders of Tennessee and the Memphis area struggled with a labor shortage due to slaves escaping to freedom behind Union lines, and they could no longer rely on profits from forced labor. White people resented and were alarmed at the many freedmen at large in Memphis and urged the military to force black people to work. The military took into custody black people classified as vagrants and forced them to accept labor contracts on plantations.Hardwick, \\"Your Old Father Abe Lincoln Is Dead And Damned\\" (1993), pp. 113‚Äì115. Quote: \\"Major William Gray, one of Dudley's officers, remarked in September, that 'I am daily urged by influential persons in the city' to compel freedmen and women to accept plantation jobs.' Dudley's attitude regarding the status of freedmen is apparent in a letter that same month, in which he wrote 'worthless, idle, persons have no rights to claim the same benefits arising from their freedom that the industrious and honest are entitled to.' In October he ordered that the streets be patroled by soldiers from Fort Pickering to pick up 'vagrants' and force them to accept labor contracts with rural planters. To some, and especially to black people, this policy seemed akin to the reimposition of slavery.\\" To General Nathan Dudley, who established this labor policy for the Memphis Freedmen's Bureau, local Reverend T. E. Bliss wrote: > How is it that the colored children in Memphis even with their spelling > books in their hands are caught up by your order & taken to the same place & > there insolently told that they 'had better be picking cotton.' Is it for > the purpose of conciliating' their old rebel masters & assisting them to get > help to secure their Cotton Crop? Has it come to this that the most Common > rights of these poor people are thus to be trampled upon for the benefit of > those who have wronged them all their days?Quoted in Hardwick, \\"Your Old > Father Abe Lincoln Is Dead And Damned\\" (1993), p. 115. Black soldiers counteracted efforts to force their people back to the plantations. General Davis Tilson was head of the Memphis Freedmen's Bureau prior to Dudley. Referring to activities of the soldiers dispatched to threaten idle people to return to work on the plantations, he said that \\"colored soldiers interfere with their labors and tell the freed people that the statements made to them ... are false, thereby embarrassing the operations of the Bureau.\\"Hardwick, \\"Your Old Father Abe Lincoln Is Dead And Damned\\" (1993), p. 116. Note: Tilson is discussing \\"the soldiers employed to visit the Freed people in and about Memphis and inform them that none but those having sufficient means or so permanently employed as to be able to take care of themselves will be allowed to remain.\\" = Irish residents = Prior to the war, Irish immigrants had constituted a major wave of newcomers to the city: ethnic Irish made up 9.9 percent of the population in 1850, when there were 8,841 people in the city. The population expanded at a rapid rate by 1860 to 22,623, and the Irish constituted 23.2 percent.Carriere, Marius. (2001), \\"An Irresponsible Press: Memphis Newspapers and the 1866 Riot,\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly 60(1):2Bordelon, John. (2006), \\"'Rebels to the Core:' Memphians under William T. Sherman,\\" Rhodes Journal of Regional Studies 3:7Walker, Barrington. (1998), \\"'This is the White Man's Day:' The Irish, White Racial Identity, and the 1866 Memphis Riots,\\" Left History, 5(2), p. 36 They encountered considerable discrimination, but by 1860, they occupied most positions in the police force, and had gained many elected and patronage positions in city government, including the mayor's office.Congress (1866), Memphis Riots and Massacres, p.6 But the Irish also competed with free black people for lower-class jobs rejected by white people, contributing to animosity between the two groups (similar animosity between working class white people, including Irish immigrants, and free black people competing for jobs were among the causes of acts of violence in the North, also, including the 1863 New York City draft riots). Most of the Irish had arrived beginning mid-century, since the Great Famine of the 1840s. Many settled in South Memphis, a new and ethnically diverse neighborhood constructed on two bayous. South Memphis was home mostly to families of craftsmen and semi-skilled workers. When the Army occupied Memphis, they took over nearby Fort Pickering as a base of operations. The Freedmen's Bureau also set up an office in this area.Waller, \\"Community, Class, and Race\\" (1984), p. 235. \\"It was one of several neighborhoods in Memphis whose residents could have entertained reasonable hopes for social and economic mobility, but whose precarious position within the social structure made them most vulnerable to economic fluctuation. ... While the entire economy of Memphis suffered from the complete collapse of the cotton trade in the first year of the war, it was this new, economically precarious neighborhood which was most directly confronted in with the dramatic social and demographic changes which accompanied the capture of Memphis by Union forces on June 6, 1862.\\" Black refugee settlement was concentrated further to the South and outside city limits. In the early years of the occupation, the Union Army permitted civil government, while prohibiting known Confederate veterans from taking office. Because of this, many ethnic Irish gained office during this period. General Washburne dissolved the city government in July 1864, but it was restored after the end of military occupation in July 1865.Art Carden and Christopher J. Coyne, \\"An Unrighteous Piece of Business: A New Institutional Analysis of the Memphis Riot of 1866\\", Mercatus Center, George Mason University, July 2010, accessed 1 February 2014 = Rising tensions = The Daily Avalanche was one of the local papers that exacerbated tensions toward black people, as well as against the federal Reconstruction efforts after the war.Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866\\" (1977), p. 245. The report by the Freedmen's Bureau after the riot described the long \\"bitterness\\" between the black people and the \\"low whites,\\" aggravated by some recent incidents between them. Having been told by the mayor and citizens of Memphis in 1866 that they could keep order, Major General George Stoneman had reduced his forces at Fort Pickering, and had only about 150 men assigned there. They were used to protect the large amount of mat√©riel at the fort. Social tensions in the city were heightened when the US Army used black Union Army soldiers to patrol Memphis. There was competition between the military and local government as to who was in charge; after the war, the developing role of the Freedmen's Bureau added to the ambiguity. Through early 1866, there were numerous instances of threats and fighting between black soldiers going about the city, and white Memphis policemen, who were 90% Irish immigrants. Numerous witnesses testified to the tensions between the ethnic groups. Officials of the Freedmen's Bureau reported that police arrested black soldiers for minor offenses and usually treated them brutally, in contrast to their treatment of white suspects. \\"One historian described the composition of the police force as being like \\"taking a troop of lions to guard a herd of unruly cattle\\"(U.S. House 1866:143).\\" Police were used to interacting with black people under Tennessee's slave laws and resented seeing armed black men in uniform.Hardwick, \\"Your Old Father Abe Lincoln Is Dead And Damned\\" (1993), p. 118. \\"Such behavior on the part of black soldiers was fundamentally challenging to the Memphis police, who prior to the war had been charged with enforcing the local slave codes. The soldier's conduct was disorderly, but it was flagrantly so by comparison with the expectations of black public behavior under slavery.\\" Incidents of police brutality mounted. In September 1865 Brigadier General John E. Smith banned \\"the public entertainments, balls, and parties heretofore frequently given by the colored people of this City.\\" Police sometimes violently intervened in black gatherings, and on one occasion attempted to arrest a group of women on grounds of prostitution; they were married to the soldiers at the gathering. Soldiers prevented the arrest and an armed standoff ensued.Hardwick, \\"Your Old Father Abe Lincoln Is Dead And Damned\\" (1993), pp. 117‚Äì118. Police shoved and beat black people in the street for the social crime of \\"insolence.\\"Hardwick, \\"Your Old Father Abe Lincoln Is Dead And Damned\\" (1993), p. 119. = The day before the riots = Officers commended black soldiers for restraint in these cases. But rumors spread among the white community that black people were planning some type of organized revenge for such incidents. Trouble was anticipated after most black Union troops (the Third United States Colored Heavy Artillery Regiment) were mustered out of the army on April 30, 1866. The former soldiers had to remain in the city for several days while they waited to receive their discharge pay; the Army took back their weapons, but some of the men had gained private ones. They passed the time by walking around town, drinking, and celebrating. On the afternoon of April 30, a street fight broke out between a group of three black soldiers and four Irish policemen. After taunting on both sides and a physical collision, a police officer hit a soldier in the head with a firearm, hard enough to break his weapon. After more fighting, the two groups went their separate ways. News of the incident spread across town.Ash, Massacre in Memphis (2013), pp. 93‚Äì94. \\"Three black men in military uniform, walking south on the sidewalk, have encountered four policemen going in the opposite direction. The black people have given way to the officers, but words have been exchanged, the two parties have halted, and there is trouble of some sort. One of the black persons dashes into the muddy street, trips, and falls. A policeman follows, collides with him, and also falls. Both get up and return to the sidewalk. All the men are angry, white and black people cursing one another. The officers pull out revolvers. \\"Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866\\" (1977), p. 246. \\"That very afternoon an incident in which black people fought against their tormentors provided an ominous foreshadowng of the next day's riots. Four Irish policemen and three or four former soldiers battled briefly with fists and bricks in the middle of Causey Street. After several minutes both parties separated, threatening each other with pistols and knives.\\"  Riots  = Conflict with black soldiers = On May 1, 1866, a large group of black soldiers, women, and children gathered in a public space, forming an impromptu street party. At about 4 PM, City Recorder John Creighton ordered four police officers to break up the group. The police obeyed, although the area was outside their jurisdiction, and Creighton was outside their chain of command.Ash, Massacre in Memphis (2013), p. 96. Tension escalated as the soldiers refused to disperse. The four officers, being outnumbered, retreated and called for reinforcements.Ash, Massacre in Memphis (2013), p. 97. The soldiers gave chase and gunfire broke out. Officer Stevens accidentally shot himself in the leg while drawing his firearm. His injury was blamed on the soldiers; it served as a rallying cause for police reinforcements and other participants in the riot. The conflict escalated and Officer Finn was shot and killed on Avery Street.\\"Report of an investigation of the cause, origin, and results of the late riots in the city of Memphis made by Col.

Creighton and O'Neill left the scene to report that two police officers had been shot. A force of city police and angry white residents assembled to engage the black soldiers.Ash, Massacre in Memphis (2013), pp. 99‚Äì100. Several soldiers were shot and killed early in the evening, including some who were fleeing and wounded, and one who was already under arrest.Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866\\" (1977), p. 248 General George Stoneman was asked to use military force to restore order; he declined and suggested that Sheriff Winters create a posse.Ash, Massacre in Memphis (2013), p. 103. Stoneman authorized Captain Arthur W. Allyn to deploy two units of soldiers from Fort Pickering. They patrolled Memphis from about 6 to 10 or 11 PM, by which time most of the black soldiers had retired. Stoneman also ordered all black soldiers returning to Fort Pickering to be disarmed and kept on base.Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866\\" (1977), p. 247. = Mob violence = Finding no soldiers in the late evening, the white mob that had formed turned to attack various black homes in the area, looting and assaulting the people they found there.Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866\\" (1977), pp. 247‚Äì248. \\"Finding the streets empty, the crowd divided into smaller bands. Some members, including Sheriff Winters, returned to their homes. Others, led by the city police, invaded the black community under pretext of seeking arms. Once inside the homes of the Negroes, the white men often robbed, beat or raped the inhabitants. They also ' ... commenced an indiscriminate slaughter of innocent, unoffending and helpeless negroes wherever found, and without regard to age, sex or condition; the crowd set fire to their houses and tried- to force the inmates to remain there until they should be consumed by flames, or, if they attempted to escape, shooting them as wild beasts.'\\"Hardwick, \\"Your Old Father Abe Lincoln Is Dead And Damned\\" (1993), p. 120. \\"About ten o'clock Allyn's troops left South Memphis, and some time thereafter a larger \\"posse\\" arrived in the area. Finding no organized resistance, this new group split up into small groups to look for black soldiers. Under the pretext of searching for arms, and led by policemen and local community leaders, these men entered the homes of many black people, beating and killing the inhabitants, robbing them, and raping a number of black women.\\" They attacked houses, schools and churches, burning many, as well as indiscriminately attacking black residents, killing many. Some died when the mob forced them to stay in their burning homes. These activities resumed on the morning of May 2 and continued for a full day. Police and firefighters made up one third of the mob (24% and 10%, respectively, of the total group); they were joined by small business owners (28%), clerks (10%), artisans (10%) and city officials (4.5%).Waller, \\"Community, Class, and Race\\" (1984), p. 237. John Pendergast and his sons Michael and Patrick, reportedly played a key role in organizing the violence, and used their grocery store at South St. & Causey St. as a base of operations. One black woman reported that Pendergast told her, \\"I am the man that fetched this mob out here, and they will do just what I tell them.\\"Waller, \\"Community, Class, and Race\\" (1984), p. 238. \\"At the center of the riot, the intersection of South and Causey Streets, the grocery-saloon keeper mentioned most often as leader operated his business. ... Many witnesses corroborated the fact that Pendergast and his two sons, Michael and Patrick, were the chief organizers and planners of the riot, that their grocery store was a sort of headquarters where rioters gathered to collect ammunition and make plans.\\" Freedmen's schoolhouse burned. After the first day, as General Stoneman later said, the black people did not act aggressively in the riot and struggled to survive.Congress (1866), Memphis Riots and Massacres, p.4 At the site of the initial incident, City Recorder John Creighton incited a white crowd to arm and go to kill the black people and drive them from the city. Rumors of an armed rebellion of Memphis' black residents were spread by local white officials and rabble-rousers. Memphis Mayor John Park was suspiciously absent (said to be intoxicated); General Runkle, head of the Freedmen's Bureau, had insufficient forces to help. General George Stoneman, the commander of federal occupation troops in Memphis, was indecisive in trying to suppress the early stages of the rioting. His inaction resulted in an increase in the scale of damages. He declared martial law on the afternoon of May 3 and restored order by force. Tennessee Attorney General William Wallace, deputized to lead a posse of 40 men, allegedly encouraged them to kill and burn.Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866\\" (1977), pp. 250‚Äì251.Herbert Shapiro, White Violence and Black Response: From Reconstruction to Montgomery; University of Massachusetts Press, 1988; p. 7. = Casualties and cost = In total, 46 black and 2 white people were killed (one wounded himself and the other was apparently killed by other white people), 75 persons injured (mostly black), over 100 robbed, 5 black women reported being raped and testified to the subsequent congressional hearing committee, and 91 homes burned (89 held by black people, one held by a white and one by an interracial couple). Four black churches and 12 black schools were burned. Modern estimates place property losses at over $100,000, including pay taken from black veterans by the police in the first encounters.Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866\\" (1977), p. 249. Confederate veteran Ben Dennis was killed on May 3 for conversing with a black friend in a bar.Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866\\" (1977), p. 250. The results showed that the mob focused its violence against the homes (and wives) of black soldiers. Arson was the most common crime committed.Waller, \\"Community, Class, and Race\\" (1984), p. 240. The mob singled out certain households while sparing others, due to perceived subservience of the occupants.Hardwick, \\"Your Old Father Abe Lincoln Is Dead And Damned\\" (1993), pp. 121‚Äì123. \\"It is clear, however, that while the rioters were very much concerned with disarming black people, they sought more fundamentally to subjugate the black community and especially community members with Union military connections. Aftermath The Daily Avalanche praised Stoneman for his actions during the events, commenting in an editorial: \\"He has acted upon the idea that if troops are necessary here to protect the rights of the black people ever, white troops can do this with less offense to our people than black ones. He knows the wants of this country and sees that the negro can do the country more good in the cotton field than in the camp.\\"Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866\\" (1977), p. 252. The Avalanche also professed its faith that the violence would restore the old social order: \\"The chief source of all our trouble being removed, we may confidently expect a restoration of the old order of things. The negro population will now do their duty ... Negro men and negro women are suddenly looking for work on country farms ... Thank heaven, the white race are once more rulers in Memphis.\\"Hardwick, \\"Your Old Father Abe Lincoln Is Dead And Damned\\" (1993), p. 123. = Legal responses = No criminal proceedings took place against the instigators or perpetrators of the Memphis riots. The United States Attorney General, James Speed, ruled that judicial actions associated with the riots fell under state jurisdiction. But, state and local officials refused to take action, and no grand jury was ever invoked. Although criticized at the time for his inaction, General Stoneman was investigated and ultimately exonerated by a congressional committee. He said that he was reluctant initially to intervene, as the people of Memphis had said they could police themselves. He needed direct communication and a request from the mayor and council. On May 3, when they asked for his support in putting together a posse, he told them he would not permit that. He imposed martial law, refused to allow groups to assemble, and suppressed the riot. Stoneman moved to California, where he was later elected as governor, serving 1883‚Äì87. = Investigation by Freedmen's Bureau= The Memphis riot was investigated by the Freedmen's Bureau, aided by the Army and the Tennessee Inspectors General, who gathered affidavits from those involved. In addition, there was investigation and report by a Congressional committee, which reached Memphis on May 22 and interviewed 170 witnesses including Frances Thompson, gathering extensive oral histories from both black and white people.Congress (1866), Memphis Riots and Massacres, p.1 = Political effects = The outcome of the Memphis riot and a similar incident (the New Orleans massacre of 1866 in July 1866) was to increase support for Radical Reconstruction. Reports of the riot discredited President Andrew Johnson, who was from Tennessee and had been military governor of Tennessee under Lincoln. Johnson's program of Presidential Reconstruction was blocked, and the Congress moved toward Radical Reconstruction. The Radical Republicans swept the congressional elections of 1866, obtaining a veto-proof majority in Washington. Subsequently, they passed key pieces of legislation, such as the Reconstruction Acts, Enforcement Acts, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution which guaranteed citizenship, equal protection of the laws, and due process to former slaves. The change in political climate, catalyzed by response to the race riots, ultimately enabled former slaves to obtain the full rights of citizenship.\\"Memphis Race Riot\\", Tennessee EncyclopediaAsh, Massacre in Memphis (2013), p. 187. For the Tennessee Assembly, the riot highlighted the lack of state laws defining the status of freedmen.Forehand, \\"Striking Resemblance\\" (1996), pp. 44‚Äì47. = Memphis = Many black people left the city permanently because of the hostile environment. The Freedmen's Bureau continued to struggle to protect remaining residents. By 1870, the black population had declined by one-quarter from 1865, to about 15,000,Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866\\" (1977), p. 254. out of a total city population of more than 40,000. The black community continued to resist; on May 22, 1866, dock workers at the river held a strike and marched for higher wages. (All strikers were arrested.) Over the summer, the black Sons of Ham fraternal organization held demonstrations for black suffrage.Ash, Massacre in Memphis (2013), pp. 184‚Äì185. They gained it in the 19th century, but at the turn of the 20th century, Tennessee joined other Southern states in creating barriers to voter registration and voting, effectively excluding most black people from the political system for more than six decades. The state legislature took over control of the city's police force.Lovett, Bobby L. (1979). \\"Memphis Riots: White Reaction to Blacks in Memphis, May 1865-July 1866\\", Tennessee Historical Quarterly 38: 9-33 It passed a law that also overhauled the Memphis criminal punishment system, which went into effect on July 1, 1886.Ash, Massacre in Memphis (2013), p. 185.

The National Weather Service estimated that between of rain fell across the city in less than one hour, breaking all previous one-hour rainfall records in the area. Most of the downtown area was underwater, with the deluge reaching deep in places. The flood was the third major disaster to strike the region in less than one year. (Winds from Hurricane Ike knocked out the electrical grid, an ice storm took out the electrical grid, then the flash flood.) Early damage estimates were in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The University of Louisville and the Louisville Public Library's main branch each sustained millions of dollars in damage. On August 12, Governor of Kentucky Steve Beshear requested the federal government declare all of Jefferson County, Kentucky a major disaster area. Storm A slow moving cluster of thunderstorms descended from central Indiana into south-central Indiana and north-central Kentucky. As it entered the region at the head of a cold front, the storm strengthened significantly and began producing hail, strong winds, and heavy rain. As the storm moved into the Louisville Metropolitan Area, it continued to strengthen as a torrential downpour inundated the area. Within a one-hour period more than of rain fell on parts of the region, breaking all previous rainfall records for a one-hour period. By the end of the day, more rain fell than is normal for the entire month of August. Downtown Louisville, New Albany, Jeffersonville, and Clarksville were particularly hard hit with water depth surpassing four feet in some areas, resulting in the first ever flash flood emergency being issued for those areas at 9:35 am EDT. Creeks and streams quickly flooded many neighborhoods, and flash floods rendered numerous streets and areas impassable. Severe lightning and wind that accompanied the storm led to more widespread damage.Courier Journal, p. A-1 Rain continued throughout the day, letting up at around 1 pm EDT. The ground had already been saturated from rains in the preceding days causing water levels to drop slower than normal. By 3 pm EDT a light rain resumed, but most of the flood waters had receded in the higher elevations of the city. Deep pools of standing water remained in isolated areas of the city until August 5. Travel impact The Louisville International Airport was closed and flights were diverted to Lexington, Kentucky until 1 pm EDT. Northbound Northwest Airlines flight 2287, traveling from Knoxville to Minneapolis, passed through the storm over Louisville and experienced severe turbulence, injuring two passengers and forcing the plane make an emergency landing at Lexington. The underground levels of all the city parking garages were completely underwater, destroying hundreds of automobiles. TARC, the city's public transportation system, was paralyzed with most buses abandoning their routes. Partly due to debris washing onto the roadways, numerous automobile accidents, and people abandoning their vehicles because of rising waters, caused I-71, I-64, I-65, and part of the Watterson Expressway (I-264) and The Gene Snyder Freeway (I-265) were shut down. Surrounding cities of New Albany, Jeffersonville, and Clarksville, Indiana were also affected. In New Albany, several parked cars were washed into the Ohio River. Additionally, most city streets were rendered impassable and several other important roadways were closed for hours. Across both Indiana and Kentucky, the massive amount of water entering the cities' underground viaducts caused a pressure build-up, blowing off a number of man-hole covers, which created dangerous road hazards. Emergency response Emergency response during the flooding, at 10th in Spring at Jeffersonville As of 10 am, additional rain up to a total of was predicted and many downtown areas began to voluntarily evacuate away from the Ohio River and onto the higher levels of buildings. Police and city officials considered ordering an evacuation of the entire downtown area as the city declared a flood emergency, but ordered people to remain in their homes and the highest point possible. Police and emergency responders began rescuing people trapped in cars and homes. Reports were made of people and bodies in the floodwaters during the deluge, but no deaths or injuries were confirmed. Police and emergencies responders from around the region were called in to assist in the relief efforts.Courier Journal, p. A-3 Governor of Kentucky Steve Beshear dispatched two fast water boats to assist in water rescues. By 3 pm EDT, Governor of Indiana Mitch Daniels sent two companies of the Indiana National Guard to assist with cleanup among the communities on the Indiana side of the Ohio River. Over two hundred people were rescued from their cars during the course of the day, with about fifty people being rescued from their homes. Most people were able to escape rising waters to higher ground without emergency help. Assistance was also provided to the downtown area to help tens of thousands of people in leaving. Damage The National Weather Service in Louisville was struck by lightning at about 9:20 am EDT, halting all operations at the location. The local emergency broadcast tower was also hit, briefly stopping all emergency communication in the city. The WDRB television news studio had water rise into the building during its newscast, prompting a makeshift water barrier to be erected during the broadcast.Courier Journal, p. A-2 At 9Àê55 am EDT, a Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued until 4 pm EDT and at about 10:40 am EDT, the National Weather Service extended the Flood Warning for the city until 1 pm EDT due to new and heavy bands of thunderstorms entering the area. Lightning struck an apartment complex in the Hurstborne neighborhood, starting a fire that consumed most of the sixteen unit building. A second apartment in the west-end of Louisville was struck by lightning and destroyed by the fire caused by the strike.Courier Journal, p. A-5 The University of Louisville, which was closed and evacuated at about 10:45 am EDT because of rising water on the campus, was among the worst hit. The university sustained over $15 million in damages with five campus buildings sustaining significant flood damage and at least four others sustaining minor damage. The main branch of the Louisville Public Library was under three of water destroying tens of thousands of books, including the newly purchased books and donations being sorted in the basement, and destroying dozens of computers; in total causing over $1 million in damage. Many people were stuck in buildings for hours because of high water in surrounding areas. The main branch sustained just over $5 million in damage and was closed for a month of repairs, outlying branches also sustained damage but to a lesser extent. Numerous other buildings went underwater and had to be evacuated including the Cancer Society, Churchill Downs and the horse barns were under three feet of water at varying points. The trackside barns remained above the water level and 35 horses were moved there. Water rose so high on the south side of Louisville that most cars parked on the street were completely submerged. At least 20,000 LG&E; customers had power service disrupted in Kentucky. Most LG&E; power terminals were underground and at least a dozen were flooded, including the terminal powering their headquarters. Four thousand Duke Energy customer lost power in southern Indiana. Norton Hospital was closed and patients evacuated to upper levels. Three local animal shelters were flooded killing at least nine animals. Hundreds of homes received major water damage in both Indiana and Kentucky including the U.S. Census Bureau building. Most of downtown New Albany was under of water. Thousands of cars were destroyed around the city, with early damage estimates in the hundreds of millions of dollars. During the first half of August damages were still being calculated. To get assistance for damaged households, Governor Bershear requested Jefferson County be declared a major disaster area by the federal government on August 12.Courier Journal. August 12, 2009 edition. Section A-1 News coverage The storm and flood received uninterrupted local radio and television coverage beginning around 9:15 am and continued into the afternoon hours. About 1:15 pm EDT the flood began to be reported on the national news networks. First on CNN, and later on the evening newscasts of the major networks.

In particular, their pre-Cenozoic evolution is very similar to that of the Eastern Alps, and they constitute a transition between the Eastern Alps and the Eastern Carpathians. The geological evolution of individual parts of the chain is complex, a result of tectonic processes like folding, thrusting and the formation of sedimentary basins of various types during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. These processes sometimes affected not only the sedimentary fill of the basins, but also, in some cases, the former basement. Many aspects of the geological structure of the Western Carpathians have not been completely studied and are subject to ongoing research and debate. The appropriate classification of a number of specific tectonic units is still not clear.  Geological definition  Geological position of the Western Carpathians in the Alpide belt. The Western Carpathians are separated from the Alps by the valley of the river Danube (only from the geographical point of view; the geological boundary is the so-called Carnuntum gate) and the Raaba line.M√≠sa≈ô, Z., 1987: Region√°ln√≠ geologie svƒõta. Academia, Praha, 708 pp. To the east, the boundary with the Eastern Carpathians is placed formally in the valley of the river Uzh, but many tectonic divisions consider the Horn√°d fault system on the line Ko≈°ice ‚Äì Pre≈°ov the real geological boundary. The northern boundary is the thrust front that separates the nappes from the Carpathian Foredeep. In Bohemia the line Znojmo-P≈ôerov-Karvin√° approximately forms the western boundary of the Western Carpathians. The southern boundary is not distinct (because of the interfingering boundary between the Carpathians and lowlands of the Pannonian Basin). According to some views it is south of the B√ºkk and M√°tra mountains in Hungary.  Geological structure  There are several interpretations of the tectonic structure of the Western Carpathians. For quite a long time, the triple division has been used (Outer, Central and Inner Western Carpathians),Mi≈°√≠k, M., Chlup√°ƒç, I., Cicha, I., 1984: Historick√° a stratigrafick√° geol√≥gia.

Tectonic division applied in this article is based on the division of Pla≈°ienka and others in 1997, later modified in 1999 and in 2002 together with Kov√°ƒç,Kov√°ƒç, M., Pla≈°ianka, D., 2002: Geological structure of the Alpine-Carpathian-Pannonian junction and neighbouring slopes of the Bohemian Massif. Comenius University, Bratislava, 88 pp. although it cannot be considered definitive. The three main areas of the Inner, Central, and Outer Western Carpathians are divided by two sutures. The Meliata suture is an area of closure of the Triassic-Jurassic Meliata Ocean during the Kimmerian phase. It constitutes the boundary between the Central and Inner Western Carpathians. The position of the boundary is disputable; different authors place the Meliata suture in different areas. It is identified with the Ro≈æ≈àava line, Luben√≠k-Margecany Line, or possibly placed even more to the South. The second important suture is called the Peri- Pieninic lineament, roughly copying the structure of Pieniny Klippen Belt. This important dislocation divides the Central and Outer Western Carpathians. Deeper under the sediments it constitutes the boundary between the Central Carpathian basement rocks and the foreland ‚Äì the Bohemian Massif and East European craton (Podolia platform). Since the 1980s the dividing line has been considered the suture of the Vahic Ocean ‚Äì the Eastern continuation of the Piemont-Liguria Ocean. Tectonic map of the Western Carpathians = Foreland = The foreland of the Western Carpathians in the West and North is composed of the Bohemian Massif and Cracow Plateau. In the Northeast it is formed by the rock of the East European craton. These areas were consolidated earlier than the Carpathians. The Bohemian Massif, which is the youngest part of the foreland, evolved during the Hercynian orogeny about 200 million years before the orogeny in the Carpathians. = Outer Western Carpathians = The Outer Western Carpathians were formed during orogeny that took part since the Upper Cretaceous (Senonian) and Miocene periods, which is later than the Central Western Carpathians. Pieniny Klippen Belt was affected by thrusting together with the Central Carpathians and later folded and thrusted again together with the Flysch Belt.  Foredeep  Thrust of the Carpathians on their foreland caused a flexure of the lower continental plate under the frontal part of the nappes. This flexured area, called the Carpathian Foredeep, was filled by thick formations of molasse, prevailingly marls, sandstones and conglomerates that were formed in the Oligocene to Miocene periods by erosion of the growing Carpathians. Nevertheless, the foredeep is not generally folded; flysch nappes thrusted from the south partially folded the rock underneath. The whole zone of the foredeep is developed in the foreland of the Alps, and runs through the Moravia to the Ostrava Basin and further East to Poland, Ukraine, and Romania.  Flysch Belt  Crossection through the Western Carpathians The Flysch Belt was named after a characteristic alteration of sandstone and claystone, so called flysch, occurring in the Cretaceous to Paleogene (possibly Miocene) age in the area. The belt is the accretionary wedge of the Carpathians. The Flysch Belt also contains a small volume of Cenozoic volcanic rocks. The zone originally consisted of a set of more sedimentary basins that were in constant tectonic transformation. Raised parts of the basins formed elevations, which were eroded and supplied deeper parts of the basin with clastic sediments that were brought by turbidity currents. Orogeny affected the area at the end of the Paleogene and in the beginning of the Neogene in the so-called Savian phase. Other portions were also affected by the Styrian phase, which caused partial thrusting over the Foredeep. Nappes were formed by gradual compression of the sedimentary basins that caused their inversion and separation of sedimentary successions from their basement and their movement for distance of 20 ‚Äì 30 km, and possibly more. Nappes were formed in two phases: the outer (Northern) or lower group of nappes called the Silezia-Krosno Belt, and the overriding internal (Southern) Magura Belt. Nappes are thrust over their foreland in the form of tectonic slices. At least part of the Flysch Belt was an Eastern continuation of the Alpine Penninic Zone, probably the Valais branch. A direct continuation of the Alpine Rhine-Danube Flysch can be seen. The Flysch Belt continues through Bohemia, Slovakia, and Poland, and joins the Moldavian Flysch in the Ukraine and Romania. = Central Western Carpathians = The Central Western Carpathians, sometimes referred as the Slovakocarpathian system, are a zone bounded by the Pieniny Klippen Belt from the North and the Meliata Belt from the South. The Pieniny Klippen Belt is a relatively thin but important dividing line separating the Outer Western Carpathians from the internal zones of orogeny. Together with the similar units of the Peri-Klippen zone it constitutes the Pova≈æie-Pieniny Belt. The largest portion of the Western Carpathians consists of the zone built of granitic and metamorphic rock (that metamorphic grade is generally higher in the North and lower in the South), and sedimentary cover overridden by thrust nappes of Mesozoic carbonate rocks. The zone consists of the Tatra-Fatra Belt of core mountains, the Vepor Belt, and the Gemer Belt. In their predominantly crystalline basement zones called the Tatric, Veporic, and Gemeric, thrusting (thick-skinned) is also present, but not as apparent. Geophysical investigation confirmed that the Gemeric is thrusted over the Veporic, and the Veporic over the Tatric.Tomek, ƒå., 1993: Deep crustal structure beneath the central and inner West Carpathians. Tectonophysics, 226, pp. 417‚Äì431 The Central Western Carpathians formerly constituted a portion of the East European craton continental shelf, and were situated more to the West, in the area of the present Switzerland, laterally joining the Outer Carpathians (represented by the Oravic). During the release of tension within the Alpine collision tectonic events, the stress was released to the flanks of the thrust belt, which caused the tectonic escape of the material. Central Western Carpathians were consequently pushed in the Northeast direction from the Alpine to Carpathian domain.  Pova≈æie-Pieniny Belt  The Pova≈æie-Pieniny Belt has a complicated imbricated structure, represented especially by the Pieniny Klippen Belt. It consists of Oravic, Gossau Group, and Magura units, as well as Inner-Carpathian units (e.g. Man√≠n and Drietoma unit etc.). Placement of the Pieniny Klippen Belt into the Central Western Carpathians is ambiguous, because most authors consider Pieniny Klippen Belt as part of the Outer Carpathians. The Pova≈æie-Pieniny Belt is divided into three zones: the Brezov√°, Peri-Klippen, and Klippen zones. Trzy Korony, one of the largest klippes of the Kysuca-Pieniny unit, Poland. Relatively thin and complicated, the Pieniny Klippen Belt creates a boundary, a tectonic suture, between the Outer and Central Western Carpathians. Only rock younger than the Triassic is known in this zone. Exclusively nonmetamorphic sedimentary successions are composed especially of limestones and marls. In the Jurassic period, the ocean that opened in the area of the Pieniny Klippen Belt is called the Vahic Ocean (or the South Penninic). Its preserved sedimentary successions are in the present erosion cut known only from the Vahic unit. The Vahic domain was bounded from the North by the slopes of the Oravic, and from the South by the Tatric unit. The subsiding part of the Oravic unit formed the Kysuca Basin. The most shallow part of the Oravic unit was characterized by deposition of shallow water limestones of Czorsztyn unit. To the South, closer to the deep water Kysuca Basin, other transitional units were deposited. In the deepest part of the Kysuca Basin, sediments of Kysuca-Pieniny unit were deposited. The Vahic domain had extended and deepened during its history. In the Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene, the thrusting of the southern units of Tatric caused inversion or subduction of the Vahic Ocean that was followed by collision of the Oravic and Tatric units. As a result of these processes, deformation and North vergent thrusting of the Oravic units in the form of nappes occurred. After the end of compression, marly and flysch-like sedimentation (so-called klippe envelope sediments) continued on the top of the nappe stack. Later in the Paleogene, another phase of orogeny affected the Pieniny Klippen Belt. It squeezed the former nappe stack and the rocks of different rheology (competent limestones, soft flysch, and marls) were deformed in different ways, which caused the rupture of more dense rock and ductile deformation of the less dense rock. Complicated arrangement of particular tectonic units was later affected by strike-slip motion in the area of the Peri-Pieniny Lineament in the Miocene. Consequent erosion dissected the rigid limestone tectonic lenses to the shape of protruding klippes (e.g. Vr≈°atsk√© bradl√° in Western Slovakia). The zone of klippes stretches almost uninterrupted from the Podbranƒç in Western Slovakia to the Poiana Botizei in Northeastern Romanian.  Tatra- Fatra Belt of core mountains  thumbrightSimplified cross-section through the Core mountain: South of the Pieniny Klippen Belt, the zone of core mountains is present. The core is formed by the Tatric unit composed predominantly by Paleozoic metamorphic rock, younger plutonic rock, and Carboniferous to Mesozoic sedimentary cover. Basement rock was formed during the Hercynian orogeny when a strong regional metamorphism affected the area. Paragneisses and amphibolites are most abundant, but low grade metamorphic rock is also present. Later, at the end of Hercynian orogeny in the Carboniferous and Permian, the area was intruded by granitic rock and strongly affected by erosion, which affected even the deeply situated granites. The autochthonous Carboniferous, Permian and most commonly Mesozoic sediments are onlaping the crystalline basement. They are represented by greywackes, quartz sandstones, shales, limestones, and marls. Sedimentary cover of the Tatric unit is overridden by Mesozoic nappes. Nappes are large slabs of the Mesozoic carbonate rock with similar sedimentary sequence as present in the Tatric cover. There are two so-called Subtatric nappes: the lower called the K√≠≈æna nappe (or the Fatric) and the upper called Choƒç nappe (or the Hronic). The Fatric is characterised by the occurrence of thicker formations of the Carpathian Keuper. The Hronic is typical with the occurrence of Permian andesitic-basalts (so called Ipoltica Group) and a larger thickness of variable Triassic carbonate rock. Thrusting of the nappes took place in the Upper Cretaceous, probably during the Turonian. The whole area was not so rangy as it is today. Uplift of the mountains took place at the end of the Oligocene and in the Miocene. It caused the uplift of the horsts, usually asymmetric, on the South flank, steeply bounded by normal faults and slightly declining to the North flank. The crystalline basement is usually uncovered on the South flank of the horsts. The horsts form two rows of mountains. The northern (outer) row consists of the Mal√© Karpaty Mts. (Pezinok part and Hainburg Mts.), Pova≈æsk√Ω Inovec Mts., Str√°≈æovsk√© vrchy Mts., Mal√° Fatra Mts., and Tatra Mts. The Southern row of core mountains includes the Tr√≠beƒç Mts., ≈Ωiar Mts., Veƒæk√° Fatra Mts., Choƒçsk√© vrchy Mts., The Eastern part of N√≠zke Tatry Mts. (so called ƒéumbierske Tatry) and Branisko Mts..Pla≈°ienka, D. 2006: Princ√≠py regionaliz√°cie geologickej stavby Mal√Ωch Karp√°t a Pova≈æsk√©ho Inovca. In: Kov√°ƒç, M., Dub√≠kov√°, K., Nov√© met√≥dy a v√Ωsledky v geol√≥gii Z√°padn√Ωch Karp√°t. Zborn√≠k 2006, pp. 51 ‚Äì 56  Vepor Belt  The Vepor Belt is a zone South of the belt of core mountains. The dividing line is called the ƒåertovica line. A characteristic feature of the Vepor belt is medium Alpine regional metamorphism. The largest area of this zone is formed by the Veporic unit. Crystalline basement rock is most abundant in this area, and the largest granitic pluton in the Western Carpathians is present here. It was formed during the Hercynian orogeny. Mesozoic sedimentary cover is preserved only locally. The Veporic unit was the root area of the Kr√≠≈æna nappe (Fatric) that was formerly situated in the inverted Zliechov Basin on the northern rim of the Veporic, close to the Tatric. Inversion of the basin took place in the Upper Cretaceous and was accompanied by intrusion of a small body of granite. In addition to nappe outliers of the Choƒç nappe (Hronic) and part of the Kr√≠≈æna nappe (Fatric), there is also a large body of Mur√°≈à nappe (Silicic unit). The Veporic is partially thrusted over the Tatric and lies under the Gemeric unit. The nappe stack of the Veporic and Gemeric later collapsed and evolved in the Veporic metamorphic core complex. The Vepor Belt forms the Eastern part of the N√≠zke Tatry Mts. (Kr√°ƒæovohoƒæsk√© Tatry), Vepor Mts., Kozie chrbty Mts., southern portion of the Branisko Mts. and ƒåierna hora Mts.. On the South it is divided from the Slovak Ore Mountains by the Luben√≠k-Margecany Line that is a gently dipping thrust fault.  Gemer Belt  The Gemer Belt is a zone of predominantly crystalline rock, partially thrusted over the Veporic. The most important portion of the zone is the Gemeric unit, unlike the other Carpathian units with signs of low grade (greenschist facies) Hercynian metamorphic overprint. The Gemeric is the uppermost basement- involved unit of the Central Western Carpathians. It is made by phyllites, quartzites, porphyrys and limestones commonly metamorphosed to siderite and magnesite. Granites are less abundant. Permian volcanic activity formed the uraninite mineralization. Later, during the Mesozoic, limestones and dolomite were deposited. In the Upper Jurassic, after the closure of the Meliata Ocean, nappes of the Meliatic and Tornaic were thrust from the South. In the Upper Cretaceous, Silicic nappe was thrust over the previous. At the end of Paleogene, the Gemeric Belt was deformed and uplifted. This zone forms the Slovak Ore Mountains, Galmus, and Slovak Karst. = Internal Western Carpathians = The Internal Western Carpathians are divided from the Central Western Carpathians by the Ro≈æ≈àava line, which is partly covered by the d√©collement nappes. The Ro≈æ≈àava line is largely a conceptual one and is perceived differently by different authors. According to assumptions, the fault joins the Raaba-Hurbanovo line on the West. Other problem of exact definition of boundary between the Internal and Central Western Carpathians are views of the structure of the Meliatic unit. The Internal Western Carpathians are composed generally of the tectonic units originating from the area of the former Meliata-Halstatt Ocean or South of it. This zone is built of the Meliata, B√ºkk, Transdanubian, and Zempl√≠n Belt. There are large nappes of Mesozoic carbonates (Silicic, Meliatic, Tornaic), which are not affected by metamorphism and are characteristic with typical affinity to the South Alps- Dinaride facies.  Meliata Belt  The Meliata Belt is a remnant of the Triassic-Jurassic Meliata ocean (or back-arc basin). The principal structural unit of the belt is Meliatic, composed of rocks of the subduction m√©lange ‚Äì deep water shales, radiolarites, basalts of oceanic type and marbles. The unit of the uncertain arrangement, which is according to some authors part of the Meliatic, is the B√¥rka Nappe, composed of the obducted blueschists. The Silicic and Tornaic unit probably originate from the Southern continental shelf of the Meliata Ocean. The Silicic is the nappe characteristic with larger thickness of shallow water limestones of Wetterstein facies. The Tornaic nappe was probably a transitional area between the Silicic and Meliatic. Nappes in the Meliata Belt were thrust to the North and now consist mostly of outliers lying on the Gemeric and Veporic units, constituting the Slovak Karst and Aggtelek Karst on the Slovak-Hungarian border.  B√ºkk Belt  To the south of the previous area there is the B√ºkkic unit, which bears the signs of the transitional zone between the Western Carpathians and the Dinarides. Rock of the B√ºkkic occurs in the north Hungarian mountain B√ºkk. It consists generally of the Paleozoic shales, carbonates, and sandstones, but also overlying younger Mesozoic carbonates and volcanic rocks. Sedimentation continued to the Jurassic when the nappes of unclear vergence were thrust. The zone was later in the Cretaceous affected by low grade metamorphism. During the subduction of the Meliata-Halstatt Ocean in the Upper Jurassic, the back- arc basin evolved. This basin was later inverted and it was probably the root zone of the M√≥nosb√©l-Szarvask≈ë nappe.  Transdanubian Belt  The Transdanubian or the Bakony Belt principal tectonic unit called the Transdanubicum occurs in the Transdanubian Mountains (Bakony, Gerecse, V√©rtes, and Buda Mountains). It consists of the low grade metamorphic Paleozoic and Mesozoic rock and Cenozoic sedimentary cover.  Zempl√≠n Belt  A tectonic unit of uncertain position is the Zemplinic in the horst of the Zempl√≠n Mts., emerging from the Cenozoic sedimentary fill of the Eastern Slovakia Basin. The Zemplinic is according to some authors either assigned to the separate belts (Zempl√≠n Belt or Sub-Vihorlat Belt) or considered as a part of the separate terrane Tisia-Dacia. Some geologists assign it to the Southern Veporic,Voz√°rov√°, A., Voz√°r, J., 1988: Late paleozoic in Western Carpathians. Geologick√Ω √∫stav Dion√Ωza ≈†t√∫ra, Bratislava, 303 pp. the Gemeric unit, or even to the Eastern Carpathians. The Zemplinic is the only place of occurrence of the Precambrian rock in the Western Carpathians. They are composed of the paragneisses, amphibolites, and migmatites, together with Post-Hercynian Carboniferous and Permian conglomerates and thin beds of black coal. = Post- nappe units = The Jurassic-Cretaceous tectonic structure was later changed by various types of the overstep complexes: the Central Carpathian Paleogene Basin, Buda Paleogene Basin, Vienna Basin (Neogene, pull-apart type), Pannonian Basin (or the Danube Basin), and the volcanic complexes: Neogene volcanics of Carpathians (or just Neovolcanis).  Volcanism  = Paleozoic and Mesozoic volcanism = Permian andesitic-basalt with agate, so called melaphyry. The oldest forms of volcanism, which affected the area of the Western Carpathians, are hardly recognized because of later tectonic processes and destruction by erosion. Significant volcanic activity took place in the Lower Paleozoic in the Mal√© Karpaty Mts., where the relicts are seen in the rock of the Pernek Group with typical basic volcanism.Puti≈°, M., Hrdliƒçka, M. a Uher, P., 2004: Litol√≥gia a granitoidn√Ω magmatizmus star≈°ieho paleozoika Mal√Ωch Karp√°t. Mineralia Slovaca, 36, pp. 183 ‚Äì 194 Large volumes of volcanic rock, considered a product of stratovolcanos, significantly changed by metamorphism, are present in the Gemeric. Basic volcanism is recognized in the Carboniferous and Permian rock. Among the Permian rock the Ipoltica Group of the Hronic nappe is best known. The lower part of the group is called the Malu≈æin√° Formation. It is characteristic of synsedimentary dacite to andesite volcanism in the lower part and andesitic-basalts close to the Tholeitic type in the upper part. Nodules of hydrothermal agate are common in the cavities of these rocks, widely known as the melaphyres. According to some authors, Permian volcanism in Hronic has polyphase linear character. Mesozoic volcanic processes are more distinct and known from all zones of the Western Carpathians. There are Triassic effusives in the rock of Fatric and Hronic of the Mal√° Fatra Mts. and N√≠zke Tatry Mts. Picrites are known around Bansk√° Bystrica. Cretaceous tƒõ≈°√≠nites (subvolcanic alcalic gabbro) were found in the Slesian zone of the Flysch Belt.Hovorka, D., 1990: Sopky. Veda, Bratislava, 147 pp. Remnants of destructed ophiolites with N-MORB basalts in the upper part are present in the rock of the Meliatic.Ivan, P., 2002: Relics of the Meliata ocean crust: Geodynamic implications of mineralogical, petrological and geochmical proxies. Geologica Carpathica, 53, 4, s. 245‚Äì256 = Cenozoic volcanism = \\"Basalt waterfall\\" at ≈†omo≈°ka castle, Cerov√° vrchovina. Typical basaltic parting. Post nappe volcanic activity in the Carpathians is simply called Neovolcanism. It took place from the Neogene (Lower Badenian) to the Quaternary, mostly in the internal portion of the Carpathian arc (on a smaller scale also in the external Carpathians). Three main phases of the volcanic activity are distinguished: * Acid volcanism ‚Äì began in the lower Miocene in northern Hungary and later extended into the territory of present Slovakia. It is represented by rhyodacite to rhyolitic rock. This type of volcanism is called the areal type, because of its large areal extent. In central Slovakia, volcanic rock formed the Poƒæana, Kremnica, and Vt√°ƒçnik Mts.. Rhyodacite tuffs in sediments of Lower Badenian are known in the Zempl√≠n region of Eastern Slovakia.Koneƒçn√Ω, V., Lexa, J., ≈†imon, L., Dublan, L., 2001: Neog√©nny vulkanizmus stredn√©ho Slovenska. Mineralia Slovaca 33, pp. 159‚Äì178 * Intermediate volcanism ‚Äì started in the Lower Badenian, and from a petrological point of view it represents calc-alcaline andesites to dacites, related to subduction of the ocean floor in the Flysch Belt and related formation of the volcanic arc. Volcanism started in a sub-aquatic environment near the ≈†ahy-Lysec zone of the Krupina Plain. Later a massive stratovolcano of the Poƒæana, Javorie, Lysec, ƒåelovce, and particularly the ≈†tiavnica stratovolcano and volcano in the Kremnica Mountains. After a period of strong erosion, the volcanic activity restored in Upper Badenian. Restored volcanism was more explosive. In the Slovak Ore Mountains (in the area of Tisovec and Rimava Basin) significantly eroded remnants of former stratovolcanoes comparable to the Central Slovakia ones were found. In the lower Sarmatian, a subduction process in the present Eastern Slovakia resulted in the formation of a line of geomorphologically simple stratovolcanoes of the Slansk√© vrchy Mts.. Volcanoes of this phase are found also in Romania. The younger phase of volcanism is known in the area of Vihorlat Mts. * Basic volcanism ‚Äì represented by alcaline rock, is found in Central and Southern Slovakia and Hungary. The prevailing rock type is basalt with phenocrysts of olivine or nepheline (basalts in the area of Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica). There were lava flows in the vicinity of the Ostr√° L√∫ka near Zvolen and Deviƒçie near Krupina, lava flows and maars in the vicinity of Pincin√°, Jel≈°ovec, lava flows, necks, dikes, and maars in Cerov√° vrchovina, and the youngest cinder cone, the Putikov v≈ï≈°ok, near the Nov√° Ba≈àa.  Metamorphism  The occurrence of metamorphosed crystalline rock in the Western Carpathians is known from the Tatric, Veporic, Gemeric, and Zemplinic zones. Existing research has clearly demonstrated traces of the Hercynian and Alpine orogeny. Although some authors suggest the possible presence of the older Cadomian or Caledonian metamorphic cycles,Puti≈°, M., Segeev, S., Ondrejka, M., Larionov, A., Siman, P., Spi≈°iak, J., Uher, P., Paderin, I., 2008: Cambrian-Ordovician metaigneous rocks associated with Cadomian fragments in the West-Carpathian basement dated by SHRIMP on zircons: a record from the Gondwana active margin setting. Geologica Carpathica, 59, 1, pp. 3‚Äì18 existence of the Precambrian metamorphic cycles was not confirmed because of the later metamorphic overprint.Krist, E., Kriv√Ω, M., 1985: Petrol√≥gia. Alfa, Bratislava, 464 pp. Caledonian metamorphism has not been clearly proved, but some signs are present in amphibolites of the Mal√© Karpaty Mts. (about 395 million years old) or the granite of Sihla type in the Veporic (about 370‚Äì380 million years old). More common is the Hercynian metamorphism, which is associated with regional and periplutonic metamorphism caused by intrusions of granitic rock, diapthoresis and low grade metamorphism of volcanosedimentary formations of several tectonic units to the greenschist facies. Signs of the Alpine metamorphism, which took place 75‚Äì107 million years ago, are well preserved in the Mesozoic formations of the Tatric, Gemeric, and especially Veporic.Krist, E., Korikovskij, S.P., Puti≈°, M., Jan√°k, M., Faryad, S.W, 1992: Geology and petrology of metamorphic rocks of the Western Carpathian crystalline complexes.

Earthquakes  The Western Carpathians are from the neotectonic point of view part of the ALCAPA block. Main earthquakes in the ALCAPA were located in the subduction arc of the Hellenides and Calabrids. Deep focus earthquakes are known only from the zone of Vrancea, where the subduction is still active. No deep focused earthquakes related to subduction were recorded in the Western Carpathians. A period of significant continental collision and shortening of the crust affected the area in the Miocene.Marko, F., 2004: Fault controlled evolution of the ALCAPA region. Geolines, 17, pp. 68‚Äì69 Later, primarily extensional and strike-slip movement in the Neogene generated new or reactivated older faults. There are five principal earthquake zones located in the area of the Western Carpathians: the Pezinok-Pernek zone, which is a continuation of the faults responsible for formation of the Vienna Basin, the Dobr√° Voda zone with the most intensive and most shallow earthquakes around the Dobr√° Voda fault, the Kom√°ro zone of earthquakes, which joins the R√°ba-Hurbanovo-Darn√≥ fault (also known as Raaba linie), separating the Pelso unit from the Inner Carpathian crystalline basement, the ≈Ωilina zone of earthquakes, related to the ongoing collision and strike-slip movement in the Pieniny Klippen Belt, and the Central Slovakia zone, which is probably the result of tectonic activity of the Central Slovak fault.

He entered Oriel College, Oxford, as a servitor in 1610 and matriculated 19 April 1611, at the age of sixteen. He graduated B.A. 1 February 1615, M.A. 4 February 1618, and B.D. 7 November 1633. Having taken orders about 1615, he preached in the neighbourhood of Oxford, till he was appointed master of the grammar school in College Green, Bristol. In 1619 he was instituted vicar of All Saints', Bristol, and preferred in 1626 to the vicarage of St. Nicholas, Bristol. He was made a chaplain to Charles I about 1633. On 20 February 1645 he was sequestered from his vicarage for opposing the parliamentary government. He was several times imprisoned under severe conditions, was ordered to be shot, and then reprieved. Gaining his liberty, he retired to Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire. After some years, through the mediation of Archbishop James Ussher, he began to preach at Kingswood Chapel, near Wotton, and was soon after presented to the neighbouring rectory of Tortworth. On the Restoration he returned to St. Nicholas, Bristol, invited by the parishioners. He was installed, 25 August 1660, in the sixth prebend in Bristol Cathedral, to which he had been nominated before the civil war; and was sworn chaplain to Charles II. In 1664 he was presented to the vicarage of Weare, Somerset. On 1 May 1667 he succeeded Henry Glemham as dean of Bristol, and in October 1671 he was offered the bishopric, vacant on the death of Gilbert Ironside, but declined it. He died on 21 April 1683, in his eighty-ninth year, and was buried in the north aisle of the choir of the cathedral. He published two sermons in 1643, another in 1676. By his wife Elizabeth he had sons Richard and William; his grandson Richard (son of Richard) was prebendary of Bristol (30 July 1685) and vicar of Bitton (1685), Olveston (1697), and Winterbourne (1698), all in Gloucestershire.

Vishal was born in Kolkata but was raised in Mumbai where he began his training in western dance at the age of ten. His talent and leadership skills were tapped immediately by his mentor Shiamak Davar making him one of the most sought after performer, choreographer, and instructor in the core group of SDIPA. His potential as a gifted dancer and being an avid learner took him to the world's most renowned dance institution: The Broadway Dance Center in New York City, USA. Under the tutelage of Frank Hatchett, Hollywood's ace choreographer for four months, Vishal got the rare and golden opportunity of performing solo at the annual Student Showcase event at Broadway in 2006 which spearheaded his journey as an entrepreneur in the entertainment field and landed him on the cover page of India Today's Kolkata edition in August 2006. Biography Born to industrialists Mr. Shriprakash Kanoi and Mrs. Pratibha Kanoi, Vishal is the third child and the youngest member of his family. He is preceded by an older brother Mr. Vikaas Kanoi and an elder sister Mrs. Nikita Bajaj. He completed his higher secondary education from Arya Vidya Mandir School (Juhu), Mumbai and went on to attain a baccalaureate degree in commerce from MMK College of Commerce and Economics located in Mumbai, India. Along with being proficient in academics, Vishal's skills in extracurricular activities (skating and swimming) always kept him in the limelight but not many knew that this child prodigy was actually a dancing star in the making. His parents saw the spark in their son and it became evident to the world when a ten-year-old Vishal danced to a standing ovation from over a thousand people at his cousin's wedding which inspired them to enroll him into India's leading choreopraher: Shiamak Davar's Institution of Performing Arts for formal training in western dance. Fortunately for Vishal, Shiamak Davar spotted his gifted feet the very next day and after an incredible impromptu extempore performance in front of the whole class Vishal was invited into the children dance troupe of SDIPA. Performer Vishal‚Äôs induction into the core group of SDIPA in 1994 gave him opportunities galore to perform on stage, small and big screen and show off his creative streak in dancing, singing, choreographies, and other aspects of entertainment. In 1996, merely two years after joining classes, Vishal was chosen to perform on ‚ÄòChak Dhum Dhum‚Äô song alongside Bollywood superstars Shahrukh Khan and Madhuri Dixit in the National Award Winning Film Dil Toh Pagal Hai produced and directed by Bollywood's legendary director Mr. Yash Chopra. His debut on big screen was followed by yet another feat in 1998 where he sang and danced to the tunes of soundtrack ‚ÄòHakuna Matata‚Äô from Lion King in the Walt Disney Show, Mumbai with various other artists. The new millennium brought brighter and bigger platforms for Vishal. From acting in the Coca-Cola commercial with heartthrob Hrithik Roshan and Mrs. World Aditi Gowitrikar, to performing for the small screen at the Indian Television Awards Ceremony, Vishal had started creating a niche for himself as an ace dancer. In 2001, Vishal made a brief appearance in the Lux Soap commercial featuring Urmila Matondkar; was invited by the Egyptian government to perform at the 7th Cairo Song Festival and assisted Shiamak in conceptualizing events like Femina Miss India. Vishal was growing from strength to strength and in 2002 he hit a career high as dancer when he performed alongside Bollywood legends Amitabh Bachchan and Sushmita Sen at the glamorous IIFA Awards 2002, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Toured the country with India‚Äôs first reality show all girls pop band VIVA for their debut album ‚ÄòHum Naye Geet Sunaye‚Äô, performed ballet in Sahara TV‚Äôs epic show Ramayana, and to top it all performed at the World Aids Day in the presence of Hollywood great Richard Gere.

Selectric Can Accommodate Six Print Fonts, New York Times, 1August 1961, \\"An electric typewriter that eliminates type bars and movable carriages and that can use six interchangeable type faces was introduced by the International Business Machines Corporation yesterday...\\" Instead of the \\"basket\\" of individual typebars that swing up to strike the ribbon and page in a typical typewriter of the period, the Selectric had an \\"element\\" (frequently called a \\"typeball\\", or less formally, a \\"golf ball\\") that rotated and pivoted to the correct position before striking. The element could be easily changed so as to use different fonts in the same document typed on the same typewriter, resurrecting a capability which had been pioneered by typewriters such as the Hammond and Blickensderfer in the late 19th century. The Selectric also replaced the traditional typewriter's horizontally moving carriage with a roller (platen) that turned to advance the paper but did not move horizontally, while the typeball and ribbon mechanism did. The Selectric mechanism was notable for using internal mechanical binary coding and two mechanical digital-to-analog converters, called whiffletree linkages, to select the character to be typed. Selectrics and their descendants eventually captured 75 percent of the United States market for electric typewriters used in business. IBM replaced the Selectric line with the IBM Wheelwriter in 1984 and transferred its typewriter business to the newly formed Lexmark in 1991. By its 25th anniversary, in 1986, a total of more than 13 million machines had been made and sold.  History, models, and related machines  IBM Selectric I = Original Selectric = The Selectric typewriter was introduced on July 31st 1961. Its industrial design is credited to influential American designer Eliot Noyes. Noyes had worked on a number of design projects for IBM; prior to his work on the Selectric, he had been commissioned in 1956 by Thomas J. Watson, Jr. to create IBM's first house style: these influential efforts, in which Noyes collaborated with Paul Rand, Marcel Breuer, and Charles Eames, have been referred to as the first \\"house style\\" program in American business. = Selectric II = IBM Selectric II (with dual Latin/Hebrew element and keyboard). The switch to the right of the backspace key shifts the machine to right-to-left typing, as is required for Hebrew. Note also the two typing position scales, one numbered left to right, the other right to left. Selectric II dual Latin/Hebrew Hadar element The Selectric remained unchanged until 1971 when the Selectric II was introduced. The original design was thereafter referred to as the SelectricI. These machines used the same 88-character typing elements. However they differed from each other in many respects: * The Selectric II was available with a Dual Pitch option to allow it to be switched (with a lever at the top left of the \\"carriage\\") between 10 and 12 characters per inch, whereas the SelectricI was ordered with one \\"pitch\\" or the other. Separate elements were available for each pitch. In a few cases the same typeface was available in both pitches, for example, \\"Courier 72\\" was the 10-pitch variant of \\"Courier 12\\". * The Selectric II had a lever (at the top left of the \\"carriage\\") that allowed characters to be shifted up to half a space to the left (for centering text, or for inserting a word one character longer or shorter in place of a deleted mistake), whereas the SelectricI did not. This option was available only on dual pitch models. * Stylistically, the Selectric II was squarer at the corners, whereas the Selectric I was rounder. = Correcting Selectric II = In 1973 the Correcting Selectric II was announced. It added an internal correction feature to the SelectricII, intended to eliminate the need for typists to use cover-up tape, \\"white-out\\" correction fluid, or typewriter erasers. The carriage on this machine held both the main typing ribbon cartridge and two small spools for a correction ribbon. A new ribbon type, the Correctable Film ribbon, was introduced at the same time. This produced typing quality equal to the carbon film ribbon, but with a pigment designed to be easily removed from paper. There were two types of correction tapes: the transparent and slightly adhesive \\"Lift-Off\\" tape (for use with the correctable film ribbon), or the white \\"Cover-Up\\" tape (for cloth, Tech-3, and carbon film ribbons). The correction tape was changed independently from the typing ribbon. The correction key (an extra key at the bottom right of the keyboard) backspaced the carriage by one space and also put the machine in a mode wherein the next character typed would use the correction tape instead of the normal ribbon, and furthermore would not advance the carriage. The typist would press (and release) the correction key and then re-type the erroneous character, either lifting it off of the page or (if using other than the correctable ribbon) covering it with white-out powder, then type the correct character. Any number of mistakes could be corrected this way, but the process was entirely manual, as the machine had no memory of the typed characters. = Selectric-based machines with data storage = In 1964 IBM introduced the \\"Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter\\" and in 1969, a \\"Magnetic Card Selectric Typewriter\\". These were sometimes referred to as the \\"MT/ST\\" and \\"MC/ST\\", respectively. The MC/ST was also available in a \\"communicating\\" version which could emulate an IBM 2741 terminal or run its native Correspondence Code. These featured electronically interfaced typing mechanisms and keyboards and a magnetic storage device (either tape in a cartridge, or a magnetic-coated card the same size as an 80-column punched card) for recording, editing, and replaying typed material at ca. 12‚Äì15 characters per second. These machines were among the first to provide word processing capability in any form. They used the same elements as ordinary office Selectrics. In 1972, the \\"Mag Card Executive\\" was offered. Like IBM's earlier typebar-based \\"Executive\\" models this offered proportional spacing, but unlike them, based on multiples of a 1/60\\" unit size with up to seven units per character, instead of a unit size of 1/32\\", 1/36\\", or 1/45\\", depending on the size of the typestyle, with up to five units per character as was used on the original \\"Executive\\" typewriters. Unlike the various \\"Selectric Composer\\" models, there was no provision for setting the machine to vary the letter and word spacing to create justified copy. Some of the fonts originally offered with the Mag Card Executive would later be made available for the Model 50 electronic typewriter, which supported proportional spacing with 96-character elements. In April 1973 the IBM Mag Card II Typewriter was announced, providing space for up to 8,000 characters in electronic memory. IBM also sold a tape reader (IBM 2495) that could be connected to 360 series mainframes, and would read the MT/ST tapes. Thus a document typed on an MT/ST Selectric could also be entered into a mainframe data file. = Selectric Composer = IBM Magnetic Card In 1966, IBM released the Selectric Composer.A preface and 13 articles on the philosophy and construction of the Composer were published in the IBM Journal of Research and Development, issue 1, January 1968, available at http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5391916, consulted August 3, 2015. This highly modified (and much more expensive) Selectric produced camera-ready justified copy using proportional fonts in a variety of font styles from eight points to fourteen points. Material prepared on a properly adjusted machine by a skillful operator and printed onto baryta (barium sulfate-coated) paper \\"would take an expert to tell... [that it] was not the product of a Linotype or Monotype machine\\". Characters were proportionally spaced, three to nine units wide, the size of a unit being selectable as either 1/72\\", 1/84\\" or 1/96\\" to allow for the three sizes of type. (A monospaced \\"Typewriter Font\\", in which all characters occupied four units, was available for brief imitations of conventional typed text.) Tab stops could be positioned only at intervals of one-sixth of an inch, or one pica. To support backspacing over previously typed characters, the spacing code for the last forty or so characters typed was mechanically stored by small sliding plates in a carrier wheel. Like the Varityper with which it competed, the original machine required that material be typed twice if the output was to be justified. The first time was to measure the length of the line and count the spaces, recording measurements read from a special dial on the right margin. The second time it was typed, the operator set the measurements into the dial to set justification for each line. The process was tedious and slow, but did provide a way to get camera-ready, proportionally spaced, justified copy from a desk-sized, affordable machine. Sample of IBM Magnetic Card Composer output (Press Roman 10pt font family) The elements for the Selectric Composer would physically fit on a Selectric and vice versa, but were not interchangeable. The characters were arranged and positioned differently around the element. Selectric Composer elements can be distinguished by their colored index arrow (the color indicated which of the three type sizes) and a series of letters and numbers identifying the font, size, and variation, for example \\"UN-11-B\\" for Univers 11-point bold (Adrian Frutiger had adapted his Univers font specifically for the Selectric Composer). In addition to Univers, a Century, Times Roman, and later an \\"Aldine\\" font (Bembo) were available, as was a Symbols font. However, the Composer, with its relatively small market, never had anything like the variety of typefaces available as there were for the Selectric (see below). Each font required separate elements for italic and bold versions, and a separate set of roman/italic/bold balls was required for each font size. Not all typefaces were available in bold and italic in every size for every font. Bold italic, condensed, and light fonts were not available. The need to change elements frequently, sometimes multiple times in the same sentence, slowed work down and was a source of owner dissatisfaction. (In typical use, Selectric elements were changed infrequently.) The small plastic balls were themselves somewhat fragile and not designed to resist frequent handling. The following font families were available for the Composer. Italic and bold were available for some but not all families. Up to three sizes existed for each size and variety. In contrast with the Selectric, to change type style usually required purchase of a family of type balls, rather than just one. Just as in the days of metal type no printing shop had every typeface, it was rare for a user firm to possess a complete set, but no user needed to: a publication that could use the somewhat bookish, academic Aldine Roman would probably not have much use for the Classified News or Copperplate Gothic (used most often for formal invitations and business cards). * Aldine Roman (similar to Bembo) * Baskerville * Bodoni * Century (similar to Century Schoolbook)Fonts In Use, https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/76054/century-ibm, consulted March 11, 2018. * Classified News (similar to News Gothic) * Copperplate Gothic * Journal Roman (similar to Janson) * Orator (a sans-serif for documents to be read aloud, enlarging letters to the maximum possible on the font element) * Press Roman (similar to Times Roman); includes Press Roman Symbol (Greek, Mathematical, Technical) * Pyramid (a slab-serif similar to Rockwell) * Theme (a sans-serif with stroke contrast, similar to Optima) * Univers * Ruling FontLuc Devroye, http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-59656.html, consulted August 3, 2015. In contrast with the Selectric, only IBM made elements for the normal typefaces usually used with the Composer. GP, which made elements for the Selectric, did make one Composer element in an Old English typeface. In 1967, a \\"Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer\\" appeared, and in 1978, a \\"Magnetic Card Selectric Composer\\". The \\"Electronic Composer\\" (with approximately 5000 characters of internal memory, similar to the later Magnetic Card model but without external storage) was marketed from 1975. All these models used the same Selectric Composer as output (printing) mechanism. However, due to the magnetic or internal storage, they avoided the need to type justified text twice or to manually set the mechanism for justification of each line. Furthermore, tapes or cards originally recorded on the much less expensive and easier to operate Selectric typewriter versions, the MT/ST or MC/ST, could be read by the \\"Composer\\" equivalents. For a number of years after its introduction, the Selectric Composer was considered a highly desirable, powerful desk-sized cold type setting system, affordable by small businesses and organizations. It was usually leased, including a service contract for the skilled labor required to fix and adjust it. The Selectric Composer was accorded respect and affection among small publishers, unrivaled until the appearance of the Apple Macintosh, laser printer, and desktop publishing software. Ultimately the system proved a transitional product, as it was displaced by cheaper phototypesetting, and then in the 1980s by word processors and general-purpose computers. = Selectric III = In 1980, IBM introduced the Selectric III, followed by several other Selectric models, some of them word processors or typesetters instead of typewriters, but by then the rest of the industry had caught up, and IBM's new models did not dominate the market the way the first Selectric had. This was to be expected, as by the late 1970s the Selectric typewriter's dominance was under assault from both 35-45 character per second proportional-spacing electronic typewriters with inbuilt memory (e.g. the 800 from Xerox based on Diablo's \\"daisywheels\\" and from OEMs of Qume who had a similar printwheel technology) and CRT-based systems from AES, Lexitron, Vydek, Wang and Xerox (see the Word Processor article for further details of these brands). In addition, IBM had already (c. 1977) brought to market the CRT-based Office System/6 (from Office Products Division) and 5520 (from IBM General Systems Division (GSD)) both of which used the new 6640 inkjet printer capable of 96 characters per second with two paper trays and sophisticated envelope handling, and was about to introduce Qume-based printers for the existing System/6 range and the new Displaywriter launched in June 1980 and described by IBM as \\"not your father's Selectric\\". Nevertheless, IBM had a large installed base of Selectric typewriters and to retain customer loyalty it made sense to introduce updated models. The Selectric III featured a 96-character element vs. the previous 88-character element. IBM's series of \\"Electronic Typewriters\\" used this same 96-character element. The 96-character elements can be identified by yellow printing on the top plastic surface and the legend \\"96\\", which always appears along with the font name and pitch. The 96- and 88-character elements are mechanically incompatible with each other (they won't fit on each other's machines) and 96-character elements were not available in as many fonts as the older 88-character types. Most Selectric IIIs and Electronic Typewriters had keys only for 92 printable characters; the 96-character keyboard was an optional feature. Fitting the additional keys onto the keyboard required shrinking the Return and Backspace keys. This was annoying to many typists, so it was not the default configuration. The keytops on SelectricIII and Electronic Typewriters were larger and more square than those on earlier Selectrics. Some versions of the Electronic Typewriter, the original Model 50, and the later Model 65 and 85, could use 96-character elements with proportionally-spaced typestyles in addition to 10-pitch and 12-pitch typestyles. This proportional spacing was based on a unit of 1/60 of an inch, since 10-pitch characters took six such units, and 12-pitch characters took five such units. (Many daisywheel typewriters, offering similar capabilities, also had daisywheel elements for 15-pitch typing, using four units per character.) The proportional typestyles offered for these typewriters had previously been offered, along with some others, on 88-character elements for a little-known variant of the MC/ST called the Mag Card Executive. = Replacement = IBM Wheelwriter 15, SeriesII IBM introduced the IBM Wheelwriter in 1984 as a replacement for the Selectric. The Wheelwriter featured a replaceable daisy wheel cartridge, had electronic memory, and offered many word processing features. = Eavesdropping = There is at least one known case of the Selectric exploited as a covert listening device of the type known as a \\"keyboard logger\\". In 1984, bugs were discovered in at least 16 Selectric typewriters in the US Embassy in Moscow and the US Consulate in Leningrad. The highly sophisticated devices were planted by the Soviets between 1976 and 1984, and were hidden inside a metal support bar. Information was intercepted by detecting the movements of metal bars inside the typewriter (the \\"latch interposers\\") by means of magnetometers. The data were then compressed and transmitted in bursts. Geoffrey Ingersoll. \\"Russia Turns To Typewriters To Protect Against Cyber Espionage\\". 2013\\\\. The bugs were installed in Selectric II and III models.Sharon A. Maneki. \\"Learning from the Enemy: The GUNMAN Project\\" . 2012.  Keyboard layout  American typewriter keyboard layout Selectric III keyboard layout The Selectric's keyboard layout put the underscore, hyphen, and single and double quote characters as pairs on their own keysan arrangement which had already been used on many earlier electric typewriters, including IBM's own Model A onwards. The traditional layout of mechanical typewriters had offered these characters as shifts from digit keys. Electric typewriter designers had made this change because smaller characters need to hit the paper with less force than most, and pairing these characters in this way avoided needing to adjust the force based on shift state. About a decade later, this character pairing was formalized in the American Standards Association X4.14-1971 standard as typewriter pairing (colloquially a typewriter-paired keyboard), along with bit-paired keyboards. Typewriter pairing became the only supported arrangement in the successor X4.23-1982 standard. The Selectric also added a dedicated key for \`1\` / \`!\`. The typist no longer had to use a lowercase \`L\`, nor overstrike the single quote and period characters, as had been the practice on most earlier typewriters. These changes were later copied by the IBM Model D electric typewriter (1967), and later still by DEC's VT52 terminal (1975) and the original IBM PC (1981). Typewriter pairing was seen on many other computer keyboards, particularly the influential Model M (1985). The new layout was not universal, however. Internationally, many layouts kept the bit-paired arrangement. This is easily visible in yielding \`\\"\`, as on the standard UK layout. The bit-paired symbols are also retained in the Japanese keyboard layout.  Selectric mechanism  Slow-motion video of whiffletree linkage in Selectric mechanism Mechanically, the Selectric borrowed some design elements from a toy typewriter produced earlier by Marx Toys. IBM bought the rights to the design. The element and carriage mechanism was similar to the design of the Teletype Model 26 and later, which used a rotating cylinder that moved along a fixed platen. The mechanism that positions the typing element (\\"ball\\") takes a binary input, and converts this to character offsets using two mechanical digital-to-analog converters, which are \\"whiffletree\\" linkages of the type used for adding and subtracting in linkage-type mechanical analog computers. (The nomenclature used by IBM Office Product Customer Engineers and in IBM maintenance publications for the machine's \\"whiffletrees\\" is \\"Rotate and Tilt Differentials\\".) Every character position on the element has a two-part binary code, one for tilt and one for rotate. The motor at the back of the machine drives a belt connected to a two-part shaft located roughly halfway through the machine. The cycle shaft on the left side powers the tilt and rotate mechanism. The operational shaft on the right side powers functions such as spacing, backspacing, and case shifting, as well as serving as a governor, limiting the left-to-right speed with which the carrier moves. A series of spring clutches power the cams which provide the motion needed to perform functions such as backspacing. When the typist presses a key, a pawl on the key lever depresses a matching metal bar (interposer) for that key. The interposer, which is oriented front to back in the machine, has one or more short projections (lugs) protruding from its bottom edge. Each interposer has a unique combination of lugs, corresponding to the binary code for the desired character. Each interposer also has a tab that slots in between loose steel balls in a race, the size of balls and race selected precisely to leave a total gap barely larger than the width of the interposer tab, such that only one interposer tab can fit in the free space and thus only one letter can be selected at a time. When the interposer is depressed, it engages a metal bar (cycle clutch latch link) that connects the clutch on the cycle shaft for one cycle, providing power to the filter shaft, whose lobes thrust the interposer towards the front (operator end) of the machine. When the interposer moves, each of its lugs engages one of a set of bars (selector bails) that run from left to right across the keyboard mechanism. In a machine with a North American keyboard, there are five \\"negative logic\\" selector bails (two for tilt and three for rotation), and one \\"positive logic\\" bail (called \\"minus five\\") for accessing characters in the opposite direction of rotation. Each negative logic selector bail that is displaced by the interposer in turn pulls a latch interposer and link which causes a selector latch near the cycle shaft to be pulled away from the latch bail. The latches pulled away in this manner are disengaged for the rest of the cycle, while the remaining latches take part in character selection, hence the term \\"negative logic\\". The minus five selector bail pulls an interposer and link which causes a latch to disengage from a cam, allowing it to move an additional input into the whiffletree that subtracts five units of rotation from any negative logic inputs. An additional \\"low velocity\\" selector latch is also engaged by certain keys (e.g. period and underscore) which require a reduced striking force so as not to cut the paper; this selector latch engages the low velocity control cam follower, which pulls the low velocity cable connected to the cam in the carrier, causing the low velocity lobe to be used instead of the usual high velocity lobe. Additionally, punctuation marks are deliberately placed about the ball so the maximum amount of energy is used to position the element prior to striking, further reducing the impact. The selector latches that remain engaged with the latch bail cause cams on the drive shaft (which is rotating) to move the ends of the links in the whiffletree linkage, which sums (adds together) the amounts (\\"weights\\") of movement corresponding to the selected bits. The sum of the weighted inputs is the required movement of the typing element. There are two sets of similar mechanisms, one for tilt, one for rotate. The typing element has four rows of 22 characters. By tilting and rotating the element to the location of a character, the element can be thrust against the ribbon and platen, leaving an imprint of the chosen character. Tilt and rotate movements are transferred to the carrier (the mechanism that supports the element), which moves across the page, by two taut metal tapes, one for tilt and one for rotate. The tilt and rotate tapes are both anchored to the right side of the carrier. They both wrap around separate pulleys at the right side of the frame; the tilt pulley is fixed, while the rotate pulley is attached to the shift arm, actuated by the Shift and Caps Lock keys. The tapes extend across the machine behind the carrier, and then wrap around two separate pulleys at the left side of the frame. The tilt tape is then anchored to a small, quarter-circle pulley which, through a link, tips the tilt ring (the device to which the element is connected) to one of four possible locations. The rotate tape is wrapped around a spring-loaded pulley located in the middle of the carrier. The rotate pulley under the tilt ring is connected through a universal joint (called a \\"dog bone\\", which it resembles) to the center of the tilt ring. The element is spring-latched onto that central post. The element rotates counter-clockwise when the rotate tape is tightened. The spiral \\"clock\\" spring underneath the rotate pulley rotates the element in the clockwise direction. As the carrier moves across the page (such as when it returns), the tapes travel over their pulleys, but the spring-loaded pulleys on the ball carrier do not pivot or rotate. To position the ball, both of the pulleys on the left side of the frame are moved by their whiffletree linkages, actuated by the selected drive shaft cams. When the rotate pulley is moved to the right or left, the rotate tape spins the element to the appropriate location. When the tilt pulley is moved, it tips the tilt ring to the appropriate location. When it moves, the tape rotates the spring-loaded pulley on the ball carrier independent of the carrier's location on the page. Case is shifted from lowercase to uppercase (and associated shifted punctuation symbols) by rotating the element by exactly half a turn. This is accomplished by moving the right-hand rotate pulley via the shift arm, using a cam mounted on the end of the operation shaft; the additional cable tension adds 180¬∞ to any rotation from the whiffletree. After a character is struck onto the paper, the mechanism is reset, including replacing all latches on their bails and moving the interposer back into position. If the key that was pressed is still down at this time, the interposer rotates the keylever pawl out of the way to prevent key repeat until the key is released and depressed again, starting the next cycle. The complex Selectric system was highly dependent upon lubrication and adjustment, and much of IBM's revenue stream came from the sale of Service Contracts on the machines. Repair was fairly expensive, so maintenance contracts were an easy sell. Both Selectric and the later Selectric II were available in standard-, medium-, and wide-carriage models and in various colors, including red and blue, as well as traditional neutral colors.  Ribbons  In addition to the \\"typeball\\" technology, Selectrics were associated with several innovations in ink ribbon design. The original Selectric had to be ordered to use either cloth reusable ribbon or one-time carbon film ribbon; the same machine could not use both. This was also true of the original, non-correcting SelectricII. IBM had used a similar carbon film ribbon on their earlier Executive series of typewriters. As with these older machines, the carbon film ribbon presented a security issue in some environments: It was possible to read the text that had been typed from the ribbon, seen as light characters against the darker ribbon background. The Correcting Selectric II used a new ribbon cartridge mechanism. The cartridge contained both supply and take-up spools, permitting both easy ribbon changes and the use of several types of ribbon on one machine. The ribbons were wider than had been used previously, giving more typed characters per inch of ribbon. Successive characters were staggered vertically on the ribbon, which incremented less than a full character position each time. Different types of ribbons had different-depth holes in the bottom of the cartridge, which set the mechanism to advance the ribbon by the amount appropriate for the type of ribbon. Three types of ribbons were initially available for the Correcting Selectric II: Reusable cloth ribbon (essentially the same as had been used on typewriters for decades); carbon film ribbon, like that used on earlier Selectrics; and the new Correctable (carbon) Film ribbon. The latter used a carbon pigment similar to that on the regular carbon film ribbon, but its binder did not permanently adhere to the paper. This permitted the use of the adhesive Lift-Off correction tape in the new machine, producing a very \\"clean\\" correction. The other types of ribbons required Cover-Up tape, which deposited a white ink on top of the characters being corrected. This complicated corrections on paper colors other than white. Shortly after the machine was introduced, a \\"Tech-3\\" ribbon appeared. It essentially replaced the cloth ribbon, as it offered typing quality close to the film ribbon but at a use cost comparable to the reusable cloth. Like the cloth ribbon, Tech-3 ribbons incremented only a fraction of the character width after being struck. Unlike the cloth ribbon, the Tech-3 ribbon provided high quality impressions for several characters from each spot on the one-time-use ribbon. Because characters overstrike each other on a Tech-3 ribbon several times it could not be easily read to discover what had been typed. The Tech-3 ribbon offered equivalent security to the carbon film ribbon, as its impressions were permanent as soon as they were struck. The Tech-3 ribbon was used with the same cover-up tape that worked with the other non-correctable ribbons. The thumb wheel on the ribbon cartridge and the correction tape spools were color- coded so they could be easily identified and matched with the appropriate correction tapes: Yellow for the correctable film ribbon and Lift-Off tape; gray, pink, and blue for cloth, carbon film, and Tech-3, respectively. Later another type of correctable film ribbon and lift-off tape appeared, both color-coded orange. The yellow meant the ribbon was a higher quality and would produce a better quality type image. Orange was a lower-cost ribbon for everyday typing. The yellow and orange coded lift-off tapes would work with either ribbon type. The slightly adhesive Lift-Off tape would sometimes damage more delicate paper surfaces. A less \\"sticky\\" version of these tapes was eventually offered, but some people believed it did not remove the ink as well. Some typists found that a piece of adhesive tape such as \\"Scotch\\" tape could be used in place of lift-off tape. Some colored ribbons (such as brown) were also available. The ribbon cartridge mechanism did not allow two-color ribbons, such as black and red which had been common on earlier typewriters.  Type elements and fonts  ‚Ç¨2 coin for scale The Selectric I, Selectric II, and all the \\"Magnetic Card\\" and \\"Magnetic Tape\\" variations except for the Composers, use the same typing elements. These are available in many fonts, including: symbols for science and mathematics, OCR faces for scanning by computers, cursive script, \\"Old English\\" (fraktur), and more than a dozen ordinary alphabets. The Israeli typographer Henri Friedlaender designed the Hebrew fonts Hadar, Shalom & Aviv for the Selectric. The SelectricIII and \\"Electronic Typewriters\\" used a new 96-character element. IBM also produced computer terminals based on the Selectric mechanism, some of which (all models of the IBM 1050 series, and IBM 2741 models using \\"PTTC/BCD\\" code) used a different encoding. Though the elements were physically interchangeable, the characters were differently arranged, so standard Selectric elements could not be used in them and their elements could not be used in standard Selectrics. On the other hand, IBM 2741s using \\"correspondence coding\\" used standard office Selectric elements. The IBM 1130 computer used a Selectric mechanism as the console printer. There were two visibly different styles of mechanical design for the elements. The original models had a metal spring clip with two wire wings that were squeezed together to release the element from the typewriter. Later models had a plastic lever molded around a metal axle which pried apart the now-internal spring clip. This had a tendency to break where the lever joined the axle. The Selectric element was later redesigned to have an all-plastic lever. The font size was measured not in points but in pitches; that is, the number of letters per one inch of the typed line. As a result, 12-pitch fonts (12 letters per inch) were actually smaller than 10-pitch fonts (10 letters per inch), and roughly corresponded to the 10pt and 12pt traditional typographic font sizes. Some of the interchangeable typing elements available for the Selectric models included: = Small (12-pitch) fonts = * Elite 72 * Auto Elite * Large Elite (12) * Prestige Elite 72 * Prestige Elite 96 Adjutant * Artisan * Contempo * Courier (12) * Courier Italic * Courier Italic 96 Forms * Letter Gothic * Letter Gothic 96 Light Italic * Olde World * Oriental * Presidential Elite * Report 96 (12) Scribe * Scribe 96 Script * Symbol = Large (10-pitch) fonts = * Advocate * Boldface * Bold Courier (10) * Bookface Academic 72 * Bookface Academic 96 Business Script * Courier (10) * Courier 96 (10) * Delegate * Delegate 96 Manifold 72 * OCR * Orator (a large sans-serif font, like Univers, for documents to be read aloud) * Orator 96 Orator Presenter 96 Pica 72 * Pica 96 Presidential Pica * Prestige Pica 72 * Report 96 (10) Sunshine Orator * Title Starred fonts were 96-character elements made for the Selectric III. Many of the fonts listed here came in several sub-varieties. For example, in the early years of the Selectric, typists were used to using the lower-case letter \\"L\\" for the numeral \\"1\\", as many previous typewriters lacked a dedicated numeral \\"1\\" key. The Selectric had a dedicated key for \\"1\\"/\\"!\\", but this was also marked \\"[\\"/\\"]\\", as many of the early elements had square brackets in these positions. Using such an element required the typist to continue the old convention. Later elements tended to have the dedicated numeral \\"1\\" and exclamation point characters instead. Some moved the square brackets to the positions formerly occupied by the 1/4 and 1/2 fractions, while others lost them completely. Some put a degree symbol in place of the exclamation point. IBM would furthermore customize any element for a fee, so literally endless variations were possible. Such customized elements were identified by a gray plastic flip-up clip instead of a black one. Many specialized elements were not listed in IBM's regular brochure, but were available from IBM provided the right part number was known. For example, the element for the APL programming language was available. This element was really intended for use with the IBM 2741 printing terminal. The IBM 1130 also used this element when running APL\\\\1130.  Features and uses  The ability to change fonts, combined with the neat regular appearance of the typed page, was revolutionary, and marked the beginning of desktop publishing. Later models with dual pitch (10/12) and built-in correcting tape carried the trend even further. Any typist could produce a polished manuscript. The possibility to intersperse text in Latin letters with Greek letters and mathematical symbols made the machine especially useful for scientists writing manuscripts that included mathematical formulas. Proper mathematical typesetting was very laborious before the advent of TeX and done only for much-sold textbooks and very prestigious scientific journals. Special elements also were released for the Athabaskan languages, allowing Navajo and Apache bilingual programs in education to be typed for the first time.Christal, Mark. \\"Virtual Museum Projects for Culturally Responsive Teaching in American Indian Education\\". Dissertation. 2003: The machine had a feature called \\"Stroke Storage\\" that prevented two keys from being depressed simultaneously. When a key was depressed, an interposer, beneath the keylever, was pushed down into a slotted tube full of small metal balls (called the \\"compensator tube\\") and spring latched. These balls were adjusted to have enough horizontal space for only one interposer to enter at a time. (Mechanisms much like this were used in keyboards for teleprinters before World War II.) If a typist pressed two keys simultaneously both interposers were blocked from entering the tube. Pressing two keys several milliseconds apart allows the first interposer to enter the tube, tripping a clutch which rotated a fluted shaft driving the interposer horizontally and out of the tube. The powered horizontal motion of the interposer selected the appropriate rotate and tilt of the printhead for character selection, but also made way for the second interposer to enter the tube some milliseconds later, well before the first character had been printed. While a full print cycle was 65 milliseconds this filtering and storage feature allowed the typist to depress keys in a more random fashion and still print the characters in the sequence entered. The space bar, dash/underscore, index, backspace and line feed repeated when continually held down. This feature was referred to as \\"Typamatic\\". = Use as a computer terminal = Home computer hobbyist with a Selectric printing terminal (1978) Due to their speed (14.8 characters per second), immunity to clashing typebars, trouble-free paper path, high quality printed output, and reliability, Selectric-based mechanisms were also widely used as terminals for computers, replacing both Teletypes and older typebar-based output devices. One popular example was the IBM 2741 terminal. Among other applications, the 2741 (with a special typing element) figured prominently in the early years of the APL programming language. Despite appearances, these machines were not simply Selectric typewriters with an RS-232 connector added. As with other electric typewriters and electric adding machines of the era, Selectrics are electromechanical, not electronic, devices: the only electrical components are the cord, an on-off switch, and the motor. The keys are not electrical pushbuttons such as those found on a computer keyboard. Pressing a key does not produce an electrical signal as output, but rather engages a series of clutches which couple the motor power to the mechanism to turn and tilt the element. A Selectric would work equally well if hand-cranked (or foot-powered, like treadle powered sewing machines) at sufficient speed. The original Selectric mechanism was designed and manufactured by the office equipment division of IBM and was not engineered for use as a computer terminal. Adapting this mechanism to the needs of computer input/output was not simple. Microswitches were added to the keyboard, solenoids were added to allow the computer to trigger the typing mechanism, and interface electronics were also needed. Several mechanical components, in particular the motor and the main clutch, had to be upgraded from the typewriter versions to reliably support continuous operation. Additional microswitches had to be added to sense the state of various parts of the mechanism, such as case (upper vs. lower). Even after adding all those solenoids and switches, getting a Selectric to talk to a computer was a complicated project. The Selectric mechanism had many peculiar requirements. If commanded to shift to upper case when it was already in upper-case, the mechanism locked up and never signaled \\"done\\". The same applied to shifting the ribbon direction or initiating a carriage-return. These commands could be issued only at particular times, with the Selectric in a particular state, and then not again until the terminal signaled the operation was complete. In addition the Selectric mechanism natively used a unique code based on the \\"tilt/rotate\\" commands to the golf ball. That and the bit-parallel interface and peculiar timing requirements meant the Selectric could not be directly hooked up to a modem. Indeed, it needed a relatively large amount of logic to reconcile the two devices, and the interface logic often outweighed the printing mechanism in the early years. The optimum data rate used to drive the Selectric mechanism turned out to be equivalent to 134.5 baud, which was a highly unusual data rate before the appearance of the mechanism. Driving the Selectric mechanism at the more-standard rate of 110 baud appeared to work well, although at a slightly slower speed. However, driving the mechanism at a non-optimal rate would soon result in its failure, by forcing an internal start-stop clutch to actuate for each character typed, thus wearing it out very rapidly. Continuous typing at the proper 134.5 baud rate would engage the clutch only at the beginning and end of a long sequence of characters, as designed. The popularity of the Selectric mechanism caused computer manufacturers, such as Digital Equipment, to support the 134.5 baud data rate on their serial computer interfaces, enabling connection of IBM 2741 terminals. The 2741 was available with two different seven-bit codes (Correspondence and PTT/BCD). Code choice affected the font elements which could be used. The host computer had to translate the 2741 code into the host's internal code (usually ASCII or EBCDIC). Dedicated hardware was also built to drive Selectric printers at 134.5 baud. Particularly vexing was the Selectric's lack of a full ASCII character set. The late Bob Bemer wrote that while working for IBM he lobbied unsuccessfully to expand the typing element to 64 characters from 44. The Selectric actually provided 44 characters per case, but the point remains that with 88 printable characters it could not quite produce the full printable ASCII character set. Selectric typing element, with a daisywheel printer element in the foreground Since the keyboard was mechanically connected directly with the printer mechanism, keyboard character inputs were immediately typed by the printer mechanism, behavior called half-duplex by most of the computer industry. However, IBM insisted on calling this behavior full duplex, causing much confusion. If the computer system in turn echoed the typed input, having been configured to expect a full-duplex terminal, each character would be doubled. A further discussion of this terminology can be seen in the article on terminal emulation and elsewhere. Another odd feature of the Selectric terminals was the \\"keyboard lock\\" mechanism. If the computer system a user was communicating with was too busy to accept input, it could send a code to mechanically interlock the keyboard so the user could not press any keys. The keyboard was also locked when the computer was typing, to avoid damaging the mechanism or interleaving user input and computer output in a confusing manner. Though done to protect the print mechanism from damage, an unexpected keyboard lock activation could cause minor injury to a typist with a heavy touch. There was little obvious warning that the keyboard had locked or unlocked, other than a faint click from the interlock solenoid, easily drowned out by the printer and fan noise in many computer facilities. There was a small indicator light, but this was of little help to fast touch typists whose gaze was fixed on copy they were transcribing. The 2741 Selectric also had a special \\"print inhibit\\" feature. When the terminal received such a command from a host computer, the element still operated, but did not print on the paper. This feature was used to avoid printing computer login passwords, and for other special purposes. In spite of all these idiosyncrasies, between 1968 and about 1980, a Selectric- based printer was a relatively inexpensive and fairly popular way to get high- quality output from a computer. A minor industry developed to support small businesses and leading-edge hobbyists who would obtain a Selectric mechanism (which cost much less than a full-fledged 2741 terminal) and modify it to interface with industry-standard serial data communications. The 96-character element introduced with the Selectric III and Electronic Typewriter series could (with some customizations) handle the full ASCII character set, but by that time the computer industry had moved on to the much faster and mechanically simpler daisy wheel mechanisms such as the Diablo 630. The typewriter industry followed this trend shortly afterward, and even IBM replaced their Selectric lineup with the daisy wheel-based \\"Wheelwriter\\" series. Similar machines referred to as the IBM 1050 series were used as the console printers for many computers, such as the IBM 1130 and the IBM System/360 series. The IBM 1050 was also offered in a remote terminal configuration, similar in use to the 2741. These were designed and manufactured for this purpose, including the necessary electrical interfaces, and incorporated more rugged components than the office Selectric or even the 2741.  In popular culture  * Capitalizing on the then-new Selectric typewriters, the IBM Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair was a large theater shaped and styled to look somewhat like a giant Selectric element. * Notable Selectric users include Isaac Asimov, Hunter S. Thompson, David Sedaris, P. J. O'Rourke,\\"I do all my writing on an ancient IBM Selectric. [...] If I had a computer I would do nothing but play with it all day.\\" Stephen J. Cannell, and Philip K. Dick. * The 1963 Perry Mason story \\"The Case of the Elusive Element\\" turned on the fact that the typing element in Selectric typewriters could easily be switched, making it impossible to know which machine had actually been used to type a message. * Similarly, in the 1976 Columbo story \\"Now You See Him\\", Jack Cassidy's perfect murder is foiled when the detective reads the killer's motive on the victim's used SelectricII carbon film ribbon. * The title sequence of Gerry Anderson's 1970 TV series UFO featured close-ups of a Selectric-based machine. * In the TV series Mad Men, which is set during the early- to mid-1960s, SelectricII typewriters are featured prominently on the secretaries' desks, even though they were not introduced until 1971. In addition, the first season was set in 1960 when no Selectric model at all was yet available. In his 2008 DVD commentary, creator Matthew Weiner said the Selectric was chosen for his show for aesthetic reasons and because of the difficulty of assembling the required number of period-appropriate conventional electric typewriters. * In Philip Roth's novel The Anatomy Lesson, character Nathan Zuckerman dismisses the self-correcting SelectricII as \\"smug, puritanical, workmanlike\\" compared to his old Olivetti portable. * In R√©gis Roinsard's 2012 film Populaire about a boss training his secretary to become the 1959 world speed typing champion, he also invents the \\"golf ball\\" typewriter mechanism, which his American friend pitches to American typewriter manufacturers with the words \\"America for business, France for love\\". * In the TV series Fringe a quantum entangled typewriter from the Selectric 251 series, which doesn't officially exist, is used by agents from a parallel universe to communicate with \\"the other side\\".

It was founded as an Acadian village in 1698 and destroyed in 1755. The current settlement has a population of approximately 20, and is located just off the coast of Shepody Bay. History By 1701, poitevin Pierre Thibaudeau and members of his family (four sons and a friend) moved from Port Royal to Shepody, inaugurating another cluster of Acadian settlements here and on the Petitcodiac River. After that, his friend, Guillaume Blanchard and his two sons, founded and established themselves in Petitcodiac. In August 1755, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Monckton sent Captain Sylvanus Cobb to deport the population of Chipody. The English soldiers were sent to Beaubassin, Petitcodiac, Chipody, and Memramcook to take the Acadians prisoners. However, through guidance by the local missionary, Father LeGuerne, the Acadians hid in the woods. Then, on 26 August, Lieutenant Boish√©bert of Miramichi and 125 soldiers and a group of Micmacs, surprised 200 Englishmen, under the command of Major Joseph Frye. The English had set fire to the church of Chipoudy and 181 homes, as well as 250 houses in Petitcodiac. Boish√©bert gave the order to attack at the moment that the English were setting fire to the church of Petitcodiac. After three hours of fierce fighting, the English retreated, leaving behind 50 dead, and around 60 wounded. It was thus that 200 families were able to escape the deportation.ARSENAULT, Bona, Histoire des Acadiens, Biblioth√®que nationale du Qu√©bec. 1978.

Biography He was the son of the painter Adriaan Verwilt of Antwerp and was apprenticed to Cornelius van Poelenburgh (1586‚Äì1667) in Utrecht together with Jan van der Lijs, among others.Fran√ßois Verwilt in the RKD He is considered part of the \\"Poelenburch landscape school\\". According to Houbraken, who mentioned him as a pupil of Van Poelenburch, he painted the flesh tones of his figures in the manner of another Poelenburch pupil from The Hague, Daniel Vertangen. Fran√ßois Verwilt Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Houbraken commented however that Joachim von Sandrart claimed he had been a pupil of Kornelio van Bojo Leubourys. Cornelis de Bie wrote a poem about his figures drawn in the manner of Poelenburch that tempted Princes, Kings, and Dukes.See Het Gulden Cabinet, page 405 Works According to the RKD he lived mostly in Rotterdam, but is registered in Zeeland, where he worked in Vlissingen, Middelburg, and Veere. He became a member of the Guild of St. Luke in Middelburg in 1661, and became a member of the Veere guild in 1667, probably to sell paintings in those towns. Most of the pieces currently attributed to him are portraits and genre works, including village scenes of daily life. Verwilt became a versatile painter in many genres including historical, mythical and biblical landscapes, genre works, portrait, still life and contemporary interiors of farming and urban middle class life. His colors range from the style of Poelenburgh in his landscapes to the chiaroscuro of Rembrandt in depictions of Dutch contemporary life. His paintings are represented in many museums, including museums in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Haarlem, Budapest, Leningrad, Mainz, Osnabr√ºck, Paris, Vienna and elsewhere. There are no biographies or monographs of his works. Verwilt lived most of his life in Rotterdam and his pupils were Cornelis Cingelaar and Pieter Hovius. He died in 1691 in Rotterdam.

The daily launched on May 30, 1908. The New York Call was a socialist daily newspaper published in New York City from 1908 through 1923. The Call was the second of three English-language dailies affiliated with the Socialist Party of America, following the Chicago Daily Socialist (1906-1912) and preceding the Milwaukee Leader (1911-1938). History =Political background= In 1899 a bitter factional fight swept the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP), pitting loyalists to the party's English-language newspaper, The People, and its intense and autocratic editor, Daniel DeLeon, against a dissident faction organized around the party's German-language paper, the New Yorker Volkszeitung. In addition to personal antipathy, the two sides differed on the fundamental question of trade union policy, with the DeLeon faction favoring a continuation of the party's policy of establishing an explicitly socialist union organization and the dissidents seeking to abandon the course of dual unionism so that closer relations to the established unions of the American Federation of Labor could be forged. A bitter split had ensued, with the dissident wing ‚Äî pejoratively called \\"Kangaroos\\" by the DeLeonist SLP Regulars ‚Äî attempting to appropriate the name of the organization and its English- language newspaper for themselves. The matter ended up in the courts, with SLP Executive Secretary Henry Kuhn, Daniel DeLeon, and the Regulars victorious in the legal battle. The losers were forced by the court to change their name and the name of their publication so that no electoral or commercial confusion would result from the factional dualism.William Morris Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, 1908-1918: A History of the New York Call To Commemorate the Tenth Anniversary of Establishment, May 30th, 1918. New York: New York Call, 1918; pg. 5. On April 28, 1901, the losing side in the litigation, the so-called \\"Socialist Labor Party\\" headquartered in Rochester, New York, headed by Henry Slobodin, relaunched their weekly New York City newspaper with a new name ‚Äî The Worker.Walter Goldwater, Radical Periodicals in America, 1890-1950. New Haven, CT: Yale University Library, 1964; pg. 46. Old numbering used previously for their version of The People was carried forward, with the first issued under the new banner designated \\"Volume 11, Number 4.\\" The paper was edited by Algernon Lee, assisted by Horace Traubel, Joshua Wanhope, and others. =Fundraising efforts= The working title for the New York Call during the earliest phase of fundraising was the Daily Globe, an allusion to the logo of the Socialist Party. Even before the split there had been an effort by New York members of the SLP to establish an English-language daily newspaper. In November 1900 a meeting was held in Clarendon Hall on East 13th Street and it determined to revive an essentially defunct organization founded in 1886 for the purpose of starting a newspaper, the Workingmen's Co-operative Publishing Association (WCPA), with a goal of publishing an English daily as soon as a fund of $50,000 was accumulated for the task.Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, pp. 5-6. After a search, Julius Gerber managed to locate six surviving members of the old WCPA who remained interested in starting a new socialist newspaper were located and the organization was thus relaunched on its new task.Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, pg. 6. Fundraising proved neither quick nor easy. In November 1901 a fair was held for the benefit of the Volkszeitung, raising several thousand dollars over a four-day period so in the fall of 1902 the WCPA decided to repeat this idea to raise funds for the English daily the next spring.Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, pp. 8-9. The fair was held in March 1903; during its 16-day duration a linotype machine was put into action as a practical demonstration and a sample newspaper called the Daily Globe was produced.Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, pg. 8. Raffles were conducted, amusements held, food and drink sold, and several thousand dollars were raised for the future English daily, which was planned to be revisit the name New York Daily Globe on a permanent basis. This idea came to naught, however, when another New York paper changed its name to the Globe early in the spring of 1904. Suggestions were made for a new name for the forthcoming publication and the Daily Call was decided upon, with a launch date of September 1, 1904 targeted. The WCPA and its project lost its fundraising mojo, however, owing to the excitement and expense of the 1904 Presidential campaign of Eugene V. Debs and New York Socialist Party stalwart Ben Hanford.Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, pg. 10. By the end of June it had become clear that the drive to raise even the more modest sum of $35,000 would be met in failure and the birth of the Daily Call was necessarily postponed. While another successful fundraising fair was held in 1905, a growing range of new projects among New York Socialists, including the Rand School of Social Science, the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, the Christian Socialist Fellowship, and New York City elections in 1907 robbed the project to establish a daily Socialist newspaper of active supporters. By the fall of 1907, the number of people actively working on the project of establishing a daily paper was down to just six people, including future chief of the New York organization Julius Gerber and past National Executive Secretary of the Springfield wing of the Social Democratic Party William Butscher.Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, pg. 11. A decision was made to hold one more fundraising fair and then to launch the paper on May Day, 1908, regardless of whether or not the desired nest egg of $50,000 had been accumulated. The fair proved a financial success, the proposed May Day launch of the Call was moved back to Memorial Day, and the daily newspaper was born. =Launch of the daily= Former Socialist Party of America Executive Secretary William Mailly was the first Managing Editor of the New York Call. On May 30, 1908, the new socialist daily newspaper was launched ‚Äî the New York Call.Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, pg. 4. While the Yiddish-language and German-language socialists of New York City had long had daily newspapers of their own, The Call was remarkable as the first such effort for English-speaking radicals.The Yiddish daily was Abend Blatt, edited by Philip Krantz, Abraham Cahan, and Benjamin Fiegenbaum; the German daily the New Yorker Volkzeitung, edited by Herman Schlueter and Alexander Jonas. See: Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, pg. 4. Editorial offices were established at 6 Park Place in New York City, in a building subsequently removed and replaced by the massive Woolworth Building.Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, pg. 12. Veteran journalist George Gordon was named the first editor of the publication and former Socialist Party Executive Secretary William Mailly the paper's managing editor. Other key members of the early editorial and writing staff included W. J. Ghent, Louis Kopelin, and Algernon Lee. At the end of October 1908, nationally famous muckraking journalist Charles Edward Russell was brought aboard as associate editor, having recently joined the Socialist Party.Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, pg. 18. The Call became the second English-language socialist daily in America, following the Chicago Daily Socialist, established in 1906,\\"Chicago Daily Socialist,\\" Chicago: Workers' Publishing Society, 1906-1912. Master negative microfilm held by the Wisconsin Historical Society. but preceding the long-running Milwaukee Leader, which launched in 1911.\\"Milwaukee Leader,\\" Milwaukee: Milwaukee Social-Democratic Pub. Co., 1911-1938. Master negative microfilm held by the Wisconsin Historical Society. The daily papers of the Socialist Party were dominated ideologically by the organization's dominant \\"constructive socialist\\" alliance, with the Chicago Daily Socialist in the hands of editor A. M. Simons, the Milwaukee Leader under the general editor control of party founder and U.S. Congressman Victor L. Berger, and the Call firmly in the hands of loyalists to Morris Hillquit.David A. Shannon, The Socialist Party of America: A History. New York: Macmillan, 1955; pg. 68. The party's revolutionary socialist Left Wing was left to find other vehicles for its ideas, such as the monthly magazine published by Charles H. Kerr, the International Socialist Review as well as a small handful of weekly papers. Despite the Call's importance to the American socialist movement and to later historians of American radicalism as a \\"newspaper of record,\\" the publication was never a circulation powerhouse in the vein of J.A. Wayland's Appeal to Reason. In 1916, with Socialist Party membership waning from its peak four years earlier, circulation of the New York Call stood at an unimpressive 15,000 copies per issue ‚Äî less than half of the average circulation of the Milwaukee Leader.Daniel Bell, Marxian Socialism in the United States. (1952). Paperback edition. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1967; pg. 97. Fundraising to support the cost of a daily newspaper proved an ongoing battle for New York City Socialists, with future member of the SPA's National Executive Committee Anna A. Maley given a full- time job as fundraiser for the publication. Throughout its history proved essential for the Call to raise additional operating revenue supplementary to the funds generated by newsstand sales and advertising. =Key content (\\"Jimmie Higgins\\")= The Call was very much a New York City newspaper, featuring news of the city and the world at the front of the paper, editorial comment and news of party affairs towards the back. The paper featured a \\"Women's Department\\" overseen by the high-profile activist wife of a \\"millionaire Socialist,\\" Rose Pastor Stokes.Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, pg. 15. Editorial cartoons were given a prominent place, with material contributed by Ryan Walker and others. One of the contributions to the paper of lasting impact was a short story written by New York Socialist Ben Hanford in 1909, at a time when he was dying of cancer. The story, \\"Jimmie Higgins,\\" was a salute to the rank-and-file Socialist everyman, a committed volunteer who loyally performed the myriad of unpublicized and unglamorous laborious tasks that were essential to the successful functioning of any political organization.For the text of Hanford's story, see: Upton Sinclair (ed.), The Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest. [1915] n.c. [Pasadena, CA]: Upton Sinclair, 1921; pp. 809-811. The Higgins character proved enduring, being further immortalized in a 1919 novel by Upton Sinclair, Jimmie Higgins: A Story.Upton Sinclair, Jimmie Higgins: A Story. Pasadena, CA: Upton Sinclair, 1919. Whittaker Chambers refers to himself using that term in his 1952 memoir: > One day, shortly after we had met, Sam Krieger proposed that I should do > \\"Jimmie Higgins work.\\" He explained to me patiently that Jimmie Higgins is a > character in one of Upton Sinclair's novels or stories with a passion for > lowly jobs. I shared no such passion, but I readily agreed, for I wanted to > know the party from the ground up. I began with the Daily Worker, but not on > its editorial staff... He set me to doing the task that nobody else would > do‚Äî newsstand collections for the Daily Worker.Whittaker Chambers, Witness. > New York: Random House, 1952; pp. 209-211. The Call also provided substantial original coverage of various labor disputes, such as the New York shirtwaist strike of 1909 and disasters such as the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911.Fiegenbaum, Ten Years of Service, pp. 22-25. =Opposition to World War I= In April 1917, President Woodrow Wilson, who had recently won re-election to a second four-year term of office behind the slogan \\"He Kept Us Out of War\\", asked Congress for a declaration of war against imperial Germany. That same month, with emotions running high, elected delegates of the Socialist Party of America gathered at their 1917 Emergency National Convention to determine party policy on the war. The organization reaffirmed its staunchly anti-militarist stance, declaring its opposition to the European war and American participation in it. In June 1917, as part of the move of the United States government to military conscription, so-called \\"Espionage Act\\" legislation was passed making the obstruction of military recruitment a crime.Bell, Marxian Socialism in the United States, paperback edition, pg. 103. Mere opposition to the American war effort via public speech or the printed word was interpreted by the Wilson Administration, and affirmed by the courts, as a violation of the law and a wave of prosecutions and administrative actions followed, including action by Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson to ban offending newspapers from the mail. Mailing privileges of the New York Call were quickly revoked as part of a general offensive against the Socialist Party's press.The number of Socialist papers and magazines affected was significant. In addition to the Call, Daniel Bell mentions the official American Socialist and the privately owned Milwaukee Leader, Jewish Daily Forward, The Masses, the former National Rip-Saw, International Socialist Review, and \\"several German, Russian and Hungarian socialist dailies.\\" Many of these publications did not survive their ban from the mails. See: Bell, Marxian Socialism in the United States, paperback edition, pg. 103. Charles Ervin, managing editor of the Call during this period, decided that, beginning on Monday, December 3, 1917, the paper would be printed in the evenings and would handle its own distribution. The paper continued to be distributed outside of New York by first class mail at this time. At a meeting announcing the decision, Ervin was asked about the paper's attitude towards the U. S. Government and the war. He said that his criticism of the war was not to be understood as criticism of the government. In particular, Ervin told a New York Times reporter that: > I have always attacked Kaiserism. I attacked the German Kaiser and his > militarism in 1913 when The New York Times was praising him. I am not a > pacifist. I am a fighter, and my ancestors fought in the civil war. Just > now, however, I believe it most important for me personally to fight > capitalism and Kaiserism in this country. The Call was forced to make do for the duration of the war primarily with door-to-door sales by carriers and at newsstands. The paper did not have its second-class mailing privileges restored until June 1921. =Response to the Russian Revolution of 1917= With the advent of the Bolshevik Revolution in the fall of 1917, the Call was taken by surprise. On December 26, 1917, the paper editorialized that events in Russia had \\"got clean away from us\\" and that the editors could \\"make nothing of it at present, nor predicate anything for its future from present reports.\\"New York Call, Dec. 26, 1917, pg. 6. Quoted in Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking Press, 1957; pg. 112. The paper made its columns available both to supporters and critics of the Bolsheviks in Soviet Russia, but were generally supportive of the Russian Revolution in its earliest phase.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pg. 112. As with The Jewish Daily Forward, later a bastion of anti- communism in the Socialist Party, The Call was not severely critical of V.I. Lenin, Leon Trotsky and their regime until after the end of the Russian Civil War and the destruction of the internal left wing political opposition in 1921. As historian Theodore Draper noted: > \\"Many months after it happened, the Bolshevik revolution was still a very > hazy and contradictory phenomenon. It was not simple and clear even to the > participants. In its first stage, the Bolshevik regime consisted of a > coalition between the Bolsheviks, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, and > minor groups. Long-time Marxists and anarchists pulled together against the > common enemy... > > \\"Thus it was possible for the American Left Wing to see the Bolshevik > revolution in its own image. It could make itself believe that the Soviets > were merely Russian equivalents of 'industrial socialism' or 'industrial > unionism'...\\"Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pp. 112-113. Only in its last years, well after the 1919 departure of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party to establish the nascent American Communist movement, would the Call become consistently critical of the excesses of the Russian Communist Party. =Termination and legacy= By the early 1920s the Socialist Party was in severe membership decline and funding of the New York Call became correspondingly tenuous. In a last-ditch effort to save the paper, it was reorganized in the fall of 1923 to include non-Socialists in its management. On October 1, 1923 the name of the paper was formally changed to the New York Leader as a reflection of this new orientation and pacifist minister Norman Thomas, formerly of The World Tomorrow, was named as editor of the publication. Heber Blankenhorn became managing editor, Evans Clark business manager, and Ed Sullivan sportswriter. This effort to stabilize the daily newspaper's funding was unsuccessful, however, and the New York Leader was terminated just six weeks later. New York socialists, facing the prospect of no English-language paper in the city for the first time in more than three decades immediately met and made plans for a new weekly, to be called The New Leader in memory of the recently terminated daily. James Oneal, a former member of the New York Call staff, was made editor of this new publication. A complete run of the New York Call is available via master negative microfilm from the New York Public Library in New York City.\\"New York Call,\\" New York: Workingmen's Cooperative Pub.

She was a member of the Lebanese Parliament for almost ten years (2009-2018), representing the district of Achrafieh. Tueni is the CEO of one of Lebanon's most famous newspaper, Annahar. Tueni is a fourth generation journalist. An Nahar was established by her great-grandfather, Gebran Tueni, in 1933. Her grandfather, Ghassan Tueni, ran the newspaper for decades. She is heiress along with her siblings to the newspaper dynasty and currently a member of the Board and the Deputy General Manager of An Nahar. She is also a board trustee of the Mentor Arabia, a non-governmental regional organization that promotes drug prevention and raises awareness on various issues among Arab youth. Early life Nayla Tueni was born in Achrafieh on 31 August 1982. Her family is a prominent Orthodox Christian clan in Lebanon. She pursued her primary education at Coll√®ge Louise Wegman and went to high school at Coll√®ge Notre-Dame de Nazareth in Achrafieh. In 2005, she obtained a bachelor of arts degree in journalism from the Lebanese University. Then she received a master's degree from the Jean Monet Faculty in Paris. In 2003, she worked as a trainee for An Nahar and then wrote in the Education and Youth section of the newspaper. Political views and March 14 alliance Nayla Tueni is a secular Greek Orthodox Christian. At the time of her political campaign, she stood for belief in Christian preservation, as well as her stance against Hezbollah, brought her the support of conservative Christians of the Lebanese Forces and Kataeb party. However, she is also an advocate for secular reforms in the Lebanese sectarian system. In a reportage broadcast by Al Jazeera about the power struggle of Lebanon's Christian clans, Tueni stated in Arabic: \\"The current system means I only represent my sect. I would rather represent my country and not my sect and hope that one day Lebanese politics will not be based on sect\\". Among the 48 points she has listed in her political platform are her opposition to the foreign occupation of Lebanon by Israel or Syria, the support of a free democratic Lebanon and political pluralism. She also wishes to see Lebanon remain aside from regional tensions and conflicts, which have turned it into a battlefield for the wars others fight against each other. Tueni also wants to see Lebanese prisoners released from Syrian jails. She supports the securing of borders to prevent arms smuggling, and equal rights for Lebanese women, from voting to participating in the Army. Post 2009 period Prior to the election Nayla Tueni made a promise the Lebanese Forces (LF) block that she would join their block. However, she has yet to make this concession and so far LF do not have a representative in Achrafieh, their heartland. After the election in August 2009, Nayla married the Lebanese television presenter of the LBC program Ahmar bel Khat al-Arid, Malek Maktabi in a civil ceremony in Cyprus, since Lebanon does not recognize civil marriage yet within Lebanese territory. Tueni is an Orthodox Christian and Maktabi a Shiite Muslim. Reactions to the pairing were mixed as interfaith marriage is still unpopular among many Lebanese noting sectarian tensions still apparent in Lebanese society. In April 2010, she gave birth to a baby boy Gebran Malek Maktabi. Their second son Sharif was born in 2013 followed by their first daughter Nour in 2015.https://www.annahar.com/article/277536-ŸÜŸàÿ±-ŸÖÿßŸÑŸÉ-ŸÖŸÉÿ™ÿ®Ÿä References External links * Tueni, Nayla. \\"How Lebanon has become immoral.\\" (Opinion) Al Arabiya.

Olenhauer ordered his men to round up selected males with the aim of forcing them to march towards Rethymno. The villagers refused to conform, hence fifty were taken hostage in retribution. While on its way to Rethymno, the column was ambushed by local ELAS guerrillas,Kokonas, Nikos A., The Cretan Resistance 1941 - 1945, 1992, pp 91-94, who attacked the German detachment at a location called Sfakaki (Œ£œÜŒ±Œ∫Œ¨Œ∫Œπ), freeing the hostages and killing all the Germans.

However, in the light of events in Anogeia, he instead set out to waylay the inevitable response before the German troops left their transport and deployed, so that Anogeia might be saved. He chose an ambush site by a bridge in the Damastos location, one kilometer west of the village of Damasta and mined it with Hawkins grenades, preparing for the German reaction. After destroying various passing vehicles, among which was a lorry carrying military mail to Chania, the German force on its way to target Anogeia finally appeared. It consisted of a truck of infantrymen backed up by an armoured car. Moss and his group attacked the German troops. Moss crawled up to the back of the armoured car and dropped a grenade into the hatch. In total 35 Germans and 10 Italians were killed, as well as one Russian partisan, and 12 Axis prisoners taken in the clash that followed. Cretan partisan Manolis Spithouris (Ntampakomanolis) was seriously wounded in the abdomen.Œ§Œø œÉŒ±ŒºœÄŒøœÑŒ¨Œ∂ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒîŒ±ŒºŒ¨œÉœÑŒ±œÇ 62 œáœÅœåŒΩŒπŒ± ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨, Œ†Œ±œÑœÅŒØœÇ onLine, 7 ŒëœÖŒ≥ŒøœçœÉœÑŒøœÖ 2006; archived here: part 1, part 2 Nevertheless, he was rescued in \\"extremely brave action\\" by Kostas Kephaloyannis (Kountokostas) and treated by fellow andartes, as well as Moss and Georgios Tyrakis, managing to survive. Moss argued on his return to Cairo that Kephaloyannis should be decorated for his action. The operation is described in detail in Moss's book A War of Shadows and commemorated at Damasta and the Historical Museum of Crete. Aftermath The expediency of the ambush in Damasta has been strongly disputed. General M√ºller had replaced General Bruno Br√§uer, as commander of Fortress Crete on 1 July 1944. Br√§uer had not instigated reprisals after the Kidnap of General Kreipe as no one had been killed, and the result of the abduction had been a loss of face for the Germans rather than of personnel. This contrasted with General M√ºller and the almost instant execution of 50 Cretans after the SBS raid in May/June 1942 and the destruction of Viannos by M√ºller in September 1943 in reprisal for andartes's attacks in the Kato Simi area. Whilst Moss had hoped that the ambush might have saved Anogeia, M√ºller, now the German commander in Crete, had further strategic reasons for reprisals and terror across Crete in order to assist the German planned evacuation from much of the island to Chania as well as not wishing to let Anogeia go unpunished for years of resistance. Anogeia dwellers had been actively involved in, and given refuge to, the resistance for many years, had killed the Sergeant Commander Olenhauer and the garrison from Yeni-Gave and had also provided shelter to the abductors of General Heinrich Kreipe. His order of the day to destroy Anogeia was specific and retrospective.Ogden, Alan, Sons of Odysseus, SOE Heroes in Greece, Bene Factum Publishing Ltd, London, 2012, , page 309 His order reads:- As a result of M√ºller's order, about 30 residents of Anogeia were executed, the village was systematically pillaged for more than 20 days and eventually razed to the ground. On August 21, the Germans executed 30 men from the village of Damasta after accusing them as accomplices for not having given warning about the ambush and swept their village away. M√ºller was convicted for this and other war crimes. He was sentenced to death on 9 December 1946 and executed by firing squad 20 May 1947. Memorial Monument The monument was designed by two architects from Heraklion, Nikos Scoutelis and Flavio Zanon, and built in 1994 with funds given by the families of the village of Damasta. The monument includes an extract from a poem written by Odysseus Elytis, the Greek poet and winner of the 1979 Nobel Prize for Literature. The poem, called To Axion Esti (\\"Worthy It Is\\"; Eng. trans.) is a long poem in which the speaker explores the essence of his being as well as the identity of his country, Greece, and people.Œ§Œø ŒÜŒæŒπŒøŒΩ ŒïœÉœÑŒØ (1959); archived here The translation of the part of the poem engraved on the monument is: THEY STRIKE (MY STONE) WITH A HEAVY AXE THEY PIERCE IT WITH A HARDENED SCALPEL THEY CARVE MY STONE WITH A BITTER CHISEL AND THE MORE TIME ERODES MATTER THE CLEARER THE ORACLE COMES OUT OF MY FACE: FEAR THE WRATH OF THE DEAD AND THE STATUES OF THE ROCKS!

Rapp had been awarded the commission to design a new Scottish Rite Cathedral. A few months later, in July of the same year, it printed a perspective by Rapp showing a grand Neo-classical styled design for the Temple. Only a week later the same paper printed that Rapp's plans had been considered to be \\"not satisfactory\\".Sheppard, Carl D., Creator of the Santa Fe Style: Isaac Hamilton Rapp, Architect, University of New Mexico Press, 1988. pp. 60‚Äì62. Shortly afterwards it was announced that the Los Angeles architectural firm of Hunt and Burns had been employed instead. They produced a Moorish Revival style structure based loosely on one of the gatehouses to the Court of the Lions at the Alhambra in Spain. Sumner P. Hunt and Silas Reese Burns were well known for their designs in the California Spanish Mission Revival architecture style, but decided instead to base their design on a connection between the Spanish building tradition of New Mexico and that of the Moors in southern Spain.Wilson, Chris, The Myth of Santa Fe: Creating a Modern Regional Tradition, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1997. pp. 115‚Äì116. There are also obvious similarities with the Southwest Museum, in Los Angeles, which was being designed by Hunt and Burns around the same time, including the tower, without the Islamic entry. Still somewhat shocking today is that the building was, and still is (as of 2014) clad in pink colored stucco. That Isaac Rapp did not get the commission was not a huge loss to him as he was to build his design in 1913 as the Las Animas County Court House, in Trinidad, Colorado.Sheppard, Carl D., Creator of the Santa Fe Style: Isaac Hamilton Rapp, Architect, University of New Mexico Press, 1988. pp. 66‚Äì68.

Early life The seventh of ten children, Jean-Marie Odin was born in Hauteville, in the neighborhood of Ambierle, to Jean and Claudine Marie (n√©e Seyrol) Odin. He showed a strong inclination toward religion from an early age, and was sent at 9 to study Latin under his uncle, the pastor of Noailly, whose death soon ended this period of instruction.Randolph, Bartholomew. \\"John Mary Odin.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 22 November 2017 After two years at home, he studied the classics at Roanne and Verri√®res before beginning his studies in philosophy at L'Argenti√®re and Alix. Odin, while attending the Sulpician seminary in Lyon, accepted an appeal from Bishop Louis Dubourg in 1822 to join the missions in Louisiana. St. Mary's of the Barrens (before 1907) After arriving in New Orleans in July 1822, he was sent to complete his theological studies at St. Mary's of the Barrens Seminary in Perryville, Missouri, on the outskirts of St. Louis. He entered the Congregation of the Mission (also known as the Lazarists or Vincentians) on November 8, 1822, and was later ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Dubourg on May 4, 1823. Priesthood Odin then did missionary work in New Madrid and among the Native Americans along the Arkansas River, also serving as a professor and later president of St. Mary's Seminary. He accompanied Bishop Joseph Rosati of St. Louis to the Second Provincial Council of Baltimore in 1833 as theologian, and briefly served as pastor of Cape Girardeau, where he opened a Catholic school in 1838. The Holy See established the Apostolic Prefecture of Texas on October 24, 1839, with Odin assigned as Vice-Prefect Apostolic under Rev. John Timon. He there labored among Catholics, many of whom had fallen away amid the disorders accompanying the change of government, as well as non-Catholics and Native Americans. He was later named Coadjutor Bishop of Detroit, Michigan, in December 1840 but declined the appointment in May 1841. Texas In 1841 Odin was appointed the first Vicar Apostolic of Texas and Titular Bishop of Claudiopolis in Isauria by Pope Gregory XVI on July 16, 1841. He received his episcopal consecration on March 6, 1842, from Bishop Antoine Blanc, with Bishops Michael Portier and John J. Chanche, P.S.S., serving as co-consecrators, at New Orleans. France had recognized the Republic of Texas, and with the assistance of the French charg√© d'affaires, Alphonse Dubois de Saligny, successfully negotiated the government's confirmation of the church's title to fifteen acres in San Antonio. During his tenure, the Texan Congress returned several of the ancient churches to their original uses, schools were opened, and the Ursuline nuns (the first religious community in Texas) were introduced to care for them.Meehan, Thomas. \\"Galveston.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 22 November 2017 On May 21, 1847, Odin was named the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Galveston, which encompassed the entire state of Texas. He secured the services of communities of the Brothers of Mary and Oblates of Mary, to whom he gave charge of St. Mary's University at Galveston (which he established in 1854). He also completed arduous visitations into the more remote parts of Texas, and twice visited Europe to secure priests and material help for the diocese. By the end of his tenure, he had increased the number of priests to 84 and the number of churches to 50; for his many efforts he has been called the father of the modern Catholic Church in Texas. New Orleans Following the death of Archbishop Blanc in June 1860, Odin was appointed the second Archbishop of New Orleans on February 15, 1861. He arrived in New Orleans soon after the outbreak of the Civil War (1861-1865), which largely defined his tenure. Like other Southern bishops and the great majority of his clergy, Odin supported the Confederate cause, worked to alleviate the suffering caused by the war, and spoke out continually of the need for peace. He was one of Pope Pius IX's main contacts in his unsuccessful attempts to bring about peace. More than a half dozen of Louisiana's clergy served as Confederate chaplains throughout the South, and numerous nuns and laywomen served in hospitals assisting war victims; the Daughters of Charity not only continued their work at Charity Hospital in New Orleans, but also volunteered for city and battlefield hospitals in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Virginia. Following the war, he made serious efforts to secure adequate ministration and education to freed slaves, but was largely unsuccessful. He was also forced to close the diocesan seminary in 1867 due to lack of funds resulting from the war.Points, Marie Louise. \\"New Orleans.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 22 November 2017 Outside of the war, Odin issued financial regulations for the debt-laden archdiocese in January 1863 to save it from bankruptcy; these regulations initially met with opposition. The archdiocese was incorporated on August 15, 1866, as \\"The Roman Catholic Church of the Diocese of New Orleans,\\" and the diocesan newspaper, The Morning Star, was founded in February 1868. He appealed for priests from Europe and, in early 1863, forty seminarians and five Ursulines arrived; during the nine years of his administration, he nearly doubled the number of his clergy and churches.

The Shattariyya are members of a Sufi mystical tariqah that originated in Persia in the fifteenth century C.E. and developed, completed and codified in India. Later secondary branches were taken to Hejaz and Indonesia. The word Shattar, which means \\"lightning-quick\\", \\"speed\\", \\"rapidity\\", See Appendix II: The Rapidness. First published in 1964. or \\"fast-goer\\" Eight-volume set. shows a system of spiritual practices that lead to a state of \\"completion\\", but the name derives from its founder, Sheikh Sirajuddin Abdullah Shattar (d. 1406 CE). Unlike other Sufis, the Shattariyya do not subscribe to the concept of fana (annihilation of the ego). \\"With the sect of Shattaris, the Salik (seeker, aspirant) descends, of himself, in his own knowledge - there is no annihilation of self with them\\". Quoting Khaja Khan's book on Tasawwuf. ShattƒÅrƒ´ya order Idries Shah, writing in The Sufis, states that the Shattari technique or \\"the Rapidness\\" originated with the Naqshbandi Sufi Order. Many of the later Shattaris, especially those of Medina, were initiated into the Naqshbandiyya, and among the Mazhariyya branch of the Naqshbandiyya the shaikhs were also authorised to start into the Shattariya and other turuq. True to its name, shattari mode is the quickest. On entering shattari path the master (Pir) lifts the disciple (Mureed) from the base Maaqam (station) of Shariyat and promotes him to Tariqat in one go. Then, depending upon capacity of each disciple, he is carefully guided and made to progress through advanced stages of Haqiqat and Maarifat. Shattaris claim to hold the key to the secret meaning and mysteries of the Qur'an and possess the veiled knowledge of \`Hurf-e-Muqattiyat‚Äô (The secret alphabets). It is prohibited to disclose this knowledge publicly as this is \`Baar-e-Amaanat‚Äô (a trusted confidential deposit) of Sher-e-Khuda Maula Mushkil kusha Ali and Muhammad. Any breach of trust and misuse of this knowledge is the greatest of sins (Gunaah-e-Kabira). History The spiritual lineage of this order is a chain of transmission (silsila) said to pass from Muhammad through Bayazid Bastami (753-845 CE). v. 1-5 - 1950, p56. The Shattari order is thus a branch of the Tayfuri Khanwada. It was reputedly founded by Sheikh Sirajuddin Abdullah Shattar (d. 1406 CE), great grandson (fifth generation) of Sheikh Shihabuddin Suhrawardi. (Founder of Suharwardiya Khaanwad). He was seventh lineage disciple to Bayazid Bustami and was honored with Khilafat (Spiritual Deputyhood) from all of the 14 Sufi Tayfuriya orders (Khanwaads or Gharaanaas). Shattar was deputized and given the honorific \\"Shattar\\" by his teacher Sheikh Muhammad Taifur in recognition of the austerities he faced in achieving this station (maqam). Originating in Persia, the order and its teachings were later brought to India by Sheikh Abdullah Shattar. No ISBN. ASIN: B0006ERVCA. According to Idries Shah, Shattar made India his home in the fifteenth century . He used to judge disciples even with their eating habits and would extend his teachings only to those who did proper justice to the food. Dressed in royal robes he used to travel on streets beating drums and invite people to witness God in his presence, wandering from one monastery to another, and made known the method. His procedure was to approach the chief of a Sufi group and say, 'Teach me your method, share it with me. If you will not, I invite you to share mine.'\\" Khilafat was further passed on to Abul Fatah Hidayatullah Sarmast (d 1538) (12th Shawwal 944 hijri) His shrine is located in a small village near Vaishali, Hajipur, around 20 kilometers from Patna, Bihar. India. This Village is situated on the banks of Ganga River. He was the third son of Allauddin Kaazan Shattari. Famous Mughal Emperor Humayun was a dedicated follower of Abul Fatah Hidayatullah Sarmast and took his advice on worldly, political and spiritual issues. A future successor was Wajihuddin Alvi (d. 1018 AH / 1609 CE), also known with the title 'Haider Ali Saani‚Äô. He was born in Champaner, an ancient city of Eastern Gujarat. He later moved to Ahmedabad where he received and latter imparted knowledge in Islamic studies. He became a prominent scholar of his times and became a Mufti. Royals of that time came to him for an opinion on complex religious issues. Fatwa of Mohammed Ghaus Gwaliori was also referred to him by Mughal ruler of that time, Sultan Mehmud. He lived a simple life and always kept humble profile. He used to share whatever came to him with the poor and the needy. He was buried at Wajihuddin's Tomb, built by one of his follower, Syed Murtuza Khan Bukhari, in Khanpur, Ahmedabad. He was a great saint who wrote many books and founded an educational institution (madrasa). One of the order's distinguished masters was the 16th century Sufi, See google book search. Shah Muhammad Ghawth (d. 1562/3 C.E.)(14th Ramadan 970 hijri). Hereditarily, he belonged to the noble family and was direct descendant of Imam Ali through the poet Attar. He was a son of Sayyid Hazir al-din (misspelled Khatir al-Din) Bayazid son of Classical Sufi poet Fariduddin Attar son of Sima Wasil son of Ahmad al-Sadiq son Najibuddin Taqiyuddin son of Nur Allah Abu Bakr al-Ajli son of Ismail son of Ja'far al-Sadiq son of Muhammad al-Baqir son of Zayn al-Abidin son of Husayn son of Ali ibn Abi Talib. Greatness and fame of the Shattari order reached new height during the era of Shah Sultan Haji Hameed Mohammed Ghouse/Gwauth Gwaliori Shattari . Shah Ghawth developed the Shattariyya more fully into a \\"distinctive order\\"; and also taught the Mughal Emperor Humayun, See google book search. He wrote the book Jawahir-i khams, (The Five Jewels). See the chapter Persecution and Circumspection in Shattari Sufism by Carl W. Ernst The influence of the Shattari Order grew strong during Ghawth's leadership and spread through South Asia. See Google book search. Royals like Babur, Humayun, and Akbar held him in very high esteem. He was a pioneer in adapting ancient Indian yogic practices and meditative techniques in folds of Sufism and was instrumental in promoting secular values in lives of royals and commoners around him. He authored many books such as Jawahar-e-Khamsa, Bahrul Hayat, Aurad-e-Ghosia, Risala-e-Mehraajiya, Jamaya, Kabid Makhajan, Kanjul Vahida, etc. His other scholarly works includes a hand written \`Koran‚Äô (translated in Persian language) which is over 400 years old and has been passed down through generations (Currently the same is in the custody of Khalifaa va Sajjada Sufi Saeed Ali Shah, Mumbai). He earned extraordinary spiritual revelations and meditative powers spending 13 years in solitude of forest (jungle of chinaar) and devoted all his life in quest of the ultimate truth, in deep meditation and continues remembrance of GOD. His famous claim of experiencing the mystical journey \`mehraaj‚Äô thrice brought him trouble from extremist Islamic fronts to which he remained immune. Angered with this, Prominent and learned mufti of that time Shah Wajihuudin Gujrati (Ahmedabad) came to issue fatwah against this claim but after witnessing his spiritual station (maqaam), surrendered and become a worthy disciple of Mohammed Ghouse Gwaliori. Ghawth, an unparallaled mystic philosopher and a supremely accomplished music maestro, became the tutor of the Mughal emperor Akbar's favorite and legendary musician, Tansen as well. Although Tansen was a Hindu by birth, Shah Ghawth adopted him as an orphan and tutored him in both Sufism and music, appointing him as one of the Khalifa (spiritual deputy) of Mohammed Ghouse. Tansen was buried in Ghawth's tomb complex. Ghouse's magnificent tomb in Gwalior is a well-known tourist attraction, regarded as an excellent example of Mughal Architecture, dating from c.1565,is the most famous Sufi monument in Gwalior, renowned for its beautiful perforated stone screen (jalis), which forms around the verandah surrounding the tomb's central chamber. Each Jali is designed in unique beautiful pattern. The tomb is square stone building with a large central dome, which was originally covered with blue tiles, and hexagonal corner towers crowned by chhatris(Pavilions). Due to some unforeseen reasons, the Maqbara was closed from 1947 to 1965. Sayyed Sufi Mohammed Shah Husaini Qadri Shattari Hashmi (Father of present Sajjadanashin - Sufi Saeed Ali Shah) got spiritual orders from Mohammed Ghouse to reopen the Maqbara. In 1965, he along with some of his beloved Khalifa Sufi Hidayatullah Shah and some followers travelled to Gwalior and with the help of Shah Saheb ( Khadim ) reopened, cleaned the Maqbara and started the tradition of annual Urs (14th Ramazan). On this occasion, a White Cotton cloth (called Lattha in local languages) on which Sandalwood paste is applied by all the followers, also known as \\"Gillaf\\" is offered. This tradition has been going on for last many years by then Sufi Hidayatullah Shah and now his Khalifa Sufi Saeed Ali Shah. In 1972, a damaged marble grill of Taveez was renovated by Sufi Hidaytullah Shah along with his Khalifa's(Sufi Saeed Ali Shah & Sufi Shafi Ali Shah). The stones & the skilled labours were called in from Agra & Jaipur. This work went on for 6 months with the approval from ASI officer Mr. Dixit. Sufi Mohammed Saeed Ali Shah was Born on 5 May 1942 in Bombay, he is the son of Mohammed Shah Husaini Kadri Shattari. (A renowned Shattari Saint ‚Äì discussed in above passages). He graduated in science (B. Sc) from Jai Hind College in 1965 with distinction. He was extremely hard working since childhood. His hard work and honesty rewarded him with extremely successful career. He got married in 1969. He became murid of Sufi Hidayatullah Shah Husiani in 1969 at Gwalior inside the dargah of Mohammed Ghouse Gwaliori. He was blessed with Khilafat in 1975 and was crowned as Sajjada nashin in 1981. He resigned from the job and devoted all his energies towards the welfare of Shattari Silsila. He remained a torch bearer of Shattari lineage ever since the responsibility of Khilafat and Sajjadagi was bestowed upon him by Sufi Hidayatullah Kadri Shattari who loved him more than his own children. For more than 40 years he gave selfless service and has completely offered his being to the cause of Shattari Silsila. His contribution to this Silsila has been all round including financial, spiritual, ethical and social support. Sufi Gafoor Shah Dargah trust was formed by him in 1988 and introduced Sufi Shattari Jamaat in 2003. He left for heavenly abode in the year 2017 and his resting place has been built in Pune - India. This primary Shattari Lineage is presently headed and guided by Khalifa va Sajjada Sufi Raees Ali Shah who also happens to be the 18th Khalifa in line (if counted from Mohammed Ghouse). He is grandson of Sufi Hidayatullah Husaini and Khalifa of Sufi Mohammed Saeed Ali Shah also known with the title\`Sufi Saheb‚Äô by many of his followers. In the late sixteenth/early seventeenth century C.E.the secondary branch of Shattariyya was introduced to Medina by Sibghatallah ibn Ryuhallah al-Sindi al-Barwaji (d.1606 C.E.), a Naqshbandi shaykh. His disciple Abu'l-Mawahib al-Shinnawi (d. 1619)Suha Taji-Farouki; A Prayer for Spiritual Elevation and Protection By Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi. continued the order there. The Shattaris went on to play an important role in Medina through the seventeenth century C.E. under Ahmad al-Qushashi, al Shinnawi's successor, and then Ibrahim Kurani (d. 1689 C.E.) who was also initiated into other orders including the Naqshbandiyya, Qadiriyya and Chishtiyya. Kurani's disciple Abd al Ra'uf Singkel was authorised by him to introduce the Shattariyya to Indonesia. The Shattariyya became popular in Aceh and Java, particularly in Pamijahan and Cirebon (where it became closely associated with the court). Ibrahim Kurani's son, Muhammad Abu'l Tahir Kurani (d.1733 C.E.) inherited his father's position as head of the Medina Shattariyya as well as the role of teacher in the Prophet's mosque and Shafi'i mufti in the city. Among his students was the great Indian Naqshbandi reformer Shah Waliullah Dihlawi (d.1763 C.E.). Abu'l Tahir initiated Shah Waliullah into the Naqshbandiyya in Medina. He also initiated him into the Shadhiliyya, Shattariyya, Suhrawardiyya and Kubrawiyya. Method The Shattariyya subscribed to six fundamental principles: (i) One should not believe in self- negation but adhere to self-affirmation. (ii) Contemplation is a waste of time. (iii) Self-effacement is a wrong idea: one must say nothing except \\"I am I.\\" Unity is to understand One, see One, say One and to hear One. A Sufi of this order must say \\"I am one\\" and \\"There is no partner with me.\\" (iv) There is no need to oppose to the ego (nafs) or of mujaheda (struggle, participation in jihad with oneself). (v) There is no such state as annihilation (fana) since this would require two personalities, one wishing for annihilation and the other in whom annihilation takes place, which is dualism and not unity. (vi) One should not abstain from eating certain foods but instead should consider one's ego, its attributes and actions as identical with those of the Universal Ego. The animal soul is not an obstacle for reaching God. The Shattariyya held to the principle of wahdat al-wujud (Unity of Existence) expounded by Ibn Arabi. Abu'l Mawahib al Shinnawi was an outspoken adherent of this doctrine. And Shinnawi's successor, Ahmad al-Qushashi was described by the contemporary Damascene scholar Muhammad Amin al Muhibbi as \\"The Imam of those who expound the unity of existence\\". \`Irfan‚Äô or secret wisdom of Shattari order is transmitted \`Sina ba Sina‚Äô heart to heart from the \`pir‚Äô (master) to deserving \`Mureeds‚Äô (disciples). Genuine Shattaris are the custodians of this esoteric and mystical treasure including \`Zaat e Mohammedi‚Äô \`Hurf e Muqateat‚Äô \`Kalima‚Äô and genuine hidden understanding to Quran. Due to matured and controversial nature of the matter it is disclosed to selective few people of understanding who have the appetite and the capacity to digest this advanced philosophy of truth. This knowledge is forbidden to the masses and novice by Ali Maula Mushkil Kusha. Some aspects of Shattari teaching sought to utilize parts of Nath Yoga and other forms of yogic mystical practice to give rise to highly sophiscated, distinct and intense 'mystical' Sufi method of India (a trait shared by Naqshbandi, Sarwar Qadiri, Suhrawardi, Shadhlli and Chisti orders and many other which were based in Indian ) as comparaed to usual and less intense 'jurist' Sufi methods or orders of Iraq, Arabia, Turkey and northern Africa. Sheikh Baha' al-Din Shattari (d. 1515 C.E.) incorporated Indian spiritual practices into his Risala-i Shattariyya (The Shattari Treatise). Later The Pool of Nectar (traced by Carl Ernst to the Hindu Amrtakunda), was translated into Persian by Muhammad Ghawth. This translation was a systematic account of yogic mantras and visualization practices, assimilated and incorporated into the conceptual structure of Sufi tradition, and included an account of the chakras together with the practices required to activate them, with Sufi wazifas substituted for the traditional yogic mantras.

Although today tropical rock is usually associated with southern Florida and the Gulf Coast of the United States, tropical rock has its roots in calypso, rock, and country by artists such as Jerry Jeff Walker. Jimmy Buffett and his Coral Reefer Band helped create a tropical sub-culture beginning in the early to mid-1980s, along with other artists including Bertie Higgins. Some mainstream artists have songs in the tropical rock genre. Description Instrumentation is usually based around an acoustic guitar (as well as electric instrumentation), and often includes steel drums, congas, marimbas, vibraphones, steel guitars, or other percussion instruments to create an \\"island sound\\". While country and other musical styles focus on falling in love/falling out of love themes, Trop Rock's main focus is on \\"escapism\\"‚Äîa laid back lifestyle, tropical places, boating, simplifying and having fun. Jimmy Buffett is often referred to as the \\"Pop of Trop Rock\\". Buffett and his Coral Reefer Band helped create a tropical sub-culture beginning in the early to mid-1980s, along with other artists including Bertie Higgins. Mainstream artists Jack Johnson, Zac Brown Band, Alan Jackson and Kenny Chesney have songs in the genre. History In 2005 the Margarita M.A.F.I.A. (music, artists, fans in alliance) was established because founders Tom & Michelle Becker, as well as many others, wanted a united voice regarding Trop Rock music. Two years later an annual awards show was created (now known as the TRMA Music Awards) to recognize the artists, songwriters, musicians, radio stations, fans and others in the genre. In 2012 the Margarita M.A.F.I.A. changed its name to the Trop Rock Music Association (TRMA) to better describe its overall purpose. Due to the significant growth of the genre, in 2018 the organization decided to further expand by creating a new Board of Directors, logo, website, mission statement, and establishment as a 501(c)6 nonprofit organization. https://troprock.org/ Events The Official Jimmy Buffett Fan Club called \\"Parrot Heads in Paradise's (PHiP's) Meeting of the Minds\\", the national parrot head convention attended by members from all over the world is held each November in Key West, Florida at the Casa Marina Resort. This event now 29 years old features Jimmy Buffett's Coral Reefer Band as well as people associated with Jimmy Buffett's music. There are many trop rock musicians on multiple stages at this event. The annual gathering attracts close to 5,000 fans as well as thousands to the lower Keys area. Other than PHiP's Meeting Of The Minds in Key West, there are many other Trop Rock Music Festivals that take place throughout the year, from coast to coast. https://troprock.org/events/  Trop Rock Radio  In 2000, WBWC-FM, Dennis King of Island Time Radio began programming this format on the air in Cleveland, Ohio and streaming worldwide on Monday nights. Radio Margaritaville, available on Sirius XM Radio, also plays many of the genre's hits. As the genre flourished with the guidance of the Trop Rock Music Association independently owned internet radio stations began to rise to popularity within the \\"trop rock\\" genre to include Radio Trop Rock, Beachfront Radio, Songwriter's Island Radio, Tiki Pod Radio, Tiki Man Radio, Permanent Vacation Radio, Beach Bar Radio,Shore Life Radio, and Oyster Radio. https://troprock.org/radiostations/  References  Category:Rock music genres Category:Country music genres Category:Pop music genres Category:American rock music genres Category:American styles of music ","title":"Tropical rock"},{"id":"23862693","text":"Mettupalayam taluk is a taluk of Coimbatore rural district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

It is well known as a serious pest of tomato crops in Europe, Africa, western Asia and South and Central America. T. absoluta was originally described in 1917 by Edward Meyrick as Phthorimaea absoluta, based on individuals collected from Huancayo (Peru). Later, the pest was reported as Gnorimoschema absolutaClarke JF (1962) New species of microlepidoptera from Japan. Entomol News 73:102, Scrobipalpula absoluta (Povolny), or Scrobipalpuloides absoluta (Povolny), but was finally described under the genus Tuta as T. absoluta by Povolny in 1994Barrientos ZR, Apablaza HJ, Norero SA, Estay PP (1998) Temperatura base y constante t√©rrmica de desarrollo de la polilla del tomate, Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). Ciencia e Investigaci√≥n Agraria 25:133‚Äì137. Its life-cycle comprises four development stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. Adults usually lay eggs on the underside of leaves or stems, and to a lesser extent on fruits. After hatching, young larvae penetrate leaves, aerial fruits (like tomato) or stems, on which they feed and develop. Pupae (length: 5‚Äì6 mm) are cylindrical in shape and greenish when just formed becoming darker in color as they are near adult emergence. Adults are 6‚Äì7 mm in length and present filiform antennae and silver to grey scales Coelho MCF, Franc¬∏a FH (1987) Biologia e quemotaxia da larva e descri√ß√£o da pupa e adulto da tra√ßa-do- tomateiro. Pesqui Agropecu Bras 22:129‚Äì135. Black spots are present on anterior wings, and the females are wider and more voluminous than the males. The pest mainly presents nocturnal habits, and adults usually remain hidden during the day, showing greater morning-crepuscular activity with adults dispersing among crops by flying. Among a range of species within the Solanaceae, tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Miller) appear to be the primary host of T. absoluta. Biology The larva feeds voraciously upon tomato plants, producing large galleries in leaves, burrowing in stalks, and consuming apical buds and green and ripe fruits. It is capable of causing a yield loss of 100%.Apablaza J, 1992. La polilla del tomate y su manejo. Tattersal 79, 12‚Äì13. Tomato is the main host plant, but T. absoluta also attacks other crop plants of the nightshade family, including potato, eggplant, pepino, pepper and tobacco. It is known from many solanaceous weeds, including Datura stramonium, Lycium chilense, and Solanum nigrum. The adult moth has a wingspan around one centimeter. In favorable weather conditions eight to ten generations can occur in a single year. Global spread This moth was first known as a tomato pest in many South American countries. In 2006, it was identified in Spain Urbaneja A, Vercher R, Navarro V, Garc√≠a Mar√≠ F, Porcuna JL (2007) La polilla del tomate, Tuta absoluta. Phytoma Espa√±a 194:16‚Äì23.. The following year it was detected in France, Italy, Greece, Malta, Morocco, Algeria and Libya. In 2009 it was first reported from Turkey. The advance of T. absoluta continued to the east to reach Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Iraq and Iran. Further advances southward reached Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman and the rest of the Persian Gulf states. In Africa, T. absoluta moved from Egypt to reach Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia from the east and to reach the Senegal from the west. It was reported in Nigeria and Zambia in 2016. An up-to-date global distribution map is available on the Tuta absoluta information network.In India, Maharashtra state tomato cultivation more affect in Nov.2016.

The use of pheromone products in combination with a yellow delta trap has been recorded in South Africa. This concept is used to monitor populations of T. absoluta in tomato orchards. The combined use of pheromones as well as specific light frequency proved to be effective in suppressing the T. absoluta population and keeping it within the economic threshold as it disclosed by Russell IPM in a United Kingdom patent.United Kingdom Patent No. GB2474274 Also the use of electric mosquito traps give good results.

Prelude After the Ottoman Empire's entry into the First World War, Britain dispatched Indian Expeditionary Force D to seize control of the Shatt al Arab and the port of Basra in order to safeguard British oil interests in the Persian Gulf. Eventually, the Anglo-Indian force's mission evolved into the capture of Baghdad. However, despite victories at Qurna, Nasiryeh, and Es Sinn, the primary offensive component of I.E.F. \\"D\\", the 6th (Poona) Division withdrew southwards after the Battle of Ctesiphon. The Ottoman forces in the region, reinforced and emboldened by the withdrawal from the gates of Baghdad, pursued the Anglo-Indian force to the town of Kut-al-Amara. Strategically situated at the confluence of the Shatt al-Hayy and the Tigris River, the commander of the Poona Division decided to defend the town. On 15 December 1915, Ottoman troops had surrounded the Anglo- Indian force of about 10,000 men at the town of Kut-al-Amara. The British commander Major General Charles Townshend called for help, and the commander of the Mesopotamian theatre General Sir John Nixon began assembling a force of 19,000 men to relieve the besieged forces. This relief force, designated as the Tigris Corps, initially consisted of 2 divisions: 3rd (Lahore) Division and 7th (Meerut) Division, as well other units available in the region.Tucker, Spencer and Roberts, Priscilla Mary. World War I: encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO, 2005. . p. 1047 This relief force, commanded by Lieutenant General Fenton Aylmer, suffered two setbacks during its initial January 1916 offensive (see the Battle of Wadi). After these defeats, the relief force (now reduced to around 10,000 men) was ordered once again to attempt to break through the Ottoman lines and continued its movement up the Tigris until it encountered 30,000 men of the Ottoman Sixth Army, under the command of Khalil Pasha, at the Hanna defile, 30 miles downriver of Kut-al-Amara.Tucker, Spencer and Roberts, Priscilla Mary. World War I: encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO, 2005. . p. 538 Battle After a short bombardment on 20 and 21 January 1916, the 7th Division charged the Ottoman lines. In an advance across 600 yards of flooded no-man's land, the British sustained 2,700 casualties. The well prepared Ottoman positions, notably the well-sited machine gun nests, forced them to abandon the assault and withdraw the relief force to the base of Ali Gharbi. Aftermath Medical care was practically nonexistent, and the night after the attack saw freezing temperatures. Many British wounded suffered unnecessarily, and morale plummeted. The besieged garrison in Kut-al-Amara could hear the distant sound of the fighting relief force, and when it remained distant morale there suffered as well.Tucker, Spencer and Roberts, Priscilla Mary.

It is located at Loyola University Chicago School of Law in Chicago, Illinois. The School of Law created the institute in 1994 at the direction of then-dean Nina S. Appel, Professor Jane H. Locke, and a variety of other supporters. Funding for the institute was provided via a cy pres award from the late United States District Judge Hubert Will with funds remaining from a large antitrust settlement.Superior Beverage Co. v. Owens-Illinois, 827 F. Supp. 477, 482-83 (N.D. Ill. 1993). In 2009, the institute celebrated its 15th anniversary. Beginning in 2000, Professor Spencer Waller became director of the institute. Professor Waller has authored numerous scholarly articles and several books on the subject of antitrust. Prior to joining the institute, Professor Waller served as associate dean at Brooklyn Law School. In addition to teaching, Professor Waller practiced with the United States Department of Justice Antitrust and Criminal Divisions and with the Chicago law firm of Freeborn & Peters. Shaping the Future of Competition and Consumer Law and Policy, an online brochure, lists the antitrust- and consumer protection-focused courses offered at Loyola University Chicago School of Law, detailed descriptions of the Student Fellow and Senior Research Fellow programs, and also chronicles the institute's involvement with the local and international competition communities.  Fellowship  =Student Fellowship Program= The institute promotes the study and discussion of consumer and competition law issues through its Student Fellowship Program, which began in January 2001. Fellows are law students chosen from among applicants who meet certain minimum requirements, including academic achievement (fellows must be in the top one- third of their class), an interest in pursuing a career in antitrust or consumer protection, and complete requisite coursework.[3] The institute provides fellows with a stipend. Fellows attend all institute events as well as special programs designed to inform them of current topics of interest in competition law, practice and policy. These special programs introduce the fellows to the key policymakers in the public and private sectors. Each year, the institute sends fellows to the ABA Section of Antitrust Spring Meeting.

Facilities This halt serves the nearby holiday cottages in the Groudle Glen valley and provides an alternative access stop for the Groudle Glen Railway on the other side of the valley. It is serviced by a modern bus-type shelter which was installed in 1999 in line with the management policy of the era. This shelter provides a dual purpose, as a limited bus route also operates on the road that runs parallel to the tram line formation. When the shelter was installed a short section of lineside was faced with tarmacadam to allow access to it, and advertisements for both railways appear therein. Location On foot, the request stop is located at the junction of the King Edward Road (that which parallels the railway) and the Groudle Lane, from which it gains its name. The lane runs (one-way towards the railway) commencing at Groudle Road in the local village of Onchan near to the King Edward Bay Golf Club which was once known as Howstrake Golf Club, given its close proximity to the area; it was renamed in the early 1990s to reflect its newly found status as a more up-market club upon completion of the club house and restaurant. Holiday Cottages Groudle Glen Holiday Cottages (From King Edward Road) The primary purpose of the halt is to serve the holiday village which was first established in the late 1970s across the road from the halt in the valley; the basic bungalows are of basic chalet construction. Since this time, the top close (cul-de-sac) of bungalows have been modified for residential use whilst the more popular bungalows towards the beach area are retained for letting purposes and remain in regular use by tourists and visitors to the island. There is also a larger detached house above the holiday village known as \\"Settler's Hollow\\", once home to the complex's owners and operators, which commands views over the glen and narrow gauge railway. The road which gives access to the development is a public one, which gives car access to the beach and its own car park. It was once a pack- horse lane, and today forms part of the island's Raad Ny Foillan coastal footpath. The stony beach is a popular destination with locals, and was once also accessible from the nearby holiday camp on the adjacent headland.

William Lisle Bowles's poetry was introduced to Coleridge in 1789 and Bowles had an immediate impact on Coleridge's views of poetry. The sonnet celebrates Bowles's status as a poet. It also discusses Bowles's political beliefs, which helped shape Coleridge's ideas on government and politics. Background Bowles had an important part in Coleridge's early poetry; he served as a model Coleridge. This influence can be traced to when Coleridge was given a copy of Bowles's Sonnets, Written Chiefly on Picturesque Spots, During a Tour in 1789. Later, Coleridge dedicated a poem to Bowles in order to praise him. The poem \\"To Bowles\\" was the seventh of his Sonnets on Eminent Characters series. It was first printed on 26 December 1794 in the Morning Chronicle and rewritten for Coleridge's 1796 collection of poems. As a footnote, Coleridge explained that Bowles was \\"Author of Sonnets and other Poems, published by Dilly. To Mr. Bowles's Poetry I have always thought the following remark, from Maximus Tyrius, peculiarly applicable [...] 'I am not now treating of that Poetry, which is estimated by the pleasure it affords to the ear‚Äîthe ear having been corrupted and the judgment-seat of the perceptions; but of that which proceeds from the intellectual Helicon, that which is dignified, and appertaining to human feelings, and entering into the soul.\\"‚ÄîThe 13th Sonnet [...] the 19th [...] and the 25th [...] are compositions of, perhaps, unrivalled merit. Yet, while I am selecting these, I almost accuse myself of causeless partiality; for surely never was a Writer so equal in excellence!\\" Coleridge's quoting of Maximus Tyrius leaves out part of Maximus's quote that suggests the sentence is describing music. Poem The original version reads: The 1796 version of the poem reads: Themes The sonnet praises Bowles's abilities as a poet while comparing him to other poets. This occurred in many of Coleridge's works including a comparison of Bowles with William Cowper in a December 1796 letter to John Thelwall: \\"But do not let us introduce an act of Uniformity against Poets‚ÄîI have room enough in my brain to admire, aye & almost equally, the head and fancy of Akenside, and the heart and fancy of Bowles, the solemn Lordliness of Milton, & the divine Chit chat of Cowper.\\" This was followed in Biographia Literaria with a claim that the two poets that were, \\"the first who combine natural thoughts with natural diction; the first who reconciled the heart with the head\\". Most of the Sonnets on Eminent Characters is devoted to those Coleridge considered heroes. Although Coleridge praises Bowles for \\"soft Strains\\", Coleridge was to turn to flashy type of poetic model as he developed as a poet. However, the sonnets as a whole were not just about poetry but about Coleridge's political beliefs.

While he was a memorable teacher at Washington and Lee University, and as judge of the United States District Court for the Virgin Islands ordered that woman voters must be registered, he later came to hold what some thought were eccentric views on religion. Levitt was born in Maryland; at the age of 17 he joined the Army and served seven years, rising to the rank of sergeant. He then went to seminary and obtained a degree. After World War I broke out, he twice served, once in the ambulance corps for the French and back in the U.S. Army once the United States joined the war. After the war, he returned to school, obtaining two legal degrees, and joined the Bar. He had a number of teaching positions at various universities, and served briefly as a Federal judge in the Virgin Islands. While there, he issued decrees forcing reluctant local election officials to allow women to vote. Levitt published a number of books on religion, and ran for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in California in 1950. He finished sixth out of six behind the winner, Richard Nixon, three cross-filing Democrats, and another fringe candidate who would be convicted of bigamy the following year. He died in 1968. Early life Levitt was born on March 14, 1887, in Woodbine, Maryland. At the age of seventeen, he joined the United States Army and served seven years, rising to the rank of sergeant. After leaving the Army, he attended Meadville Theological School, which was run by the Unitarians, and received his Bachelor of Divinity in 1911. In 1913, he received a B.A. from Columbia University. Levitt served as a lecturer at Columbia after his graduation, but in 1915 crossed the Atlantic and joined the American Ambulance Corps in the French Army in 1915. He returned to the United States, where he spent a year teaching philosophy at Colgate University. When the United States joined the war in 1917, he joined the army again and served from 1917 to 1919 as a chaplain. During his time on the Western Front, he was both wounded and gassed. Harvard and the ERA Levitt had spent a brief period at Harvard as an ROTC instructor; he returned there as a law student in 1919 and received his LL.B. the following year. While at Harvard, he came to view Dean Roscoe Pound as his mentor, and, in part due to his romantic relationship to women's activist Elsie Hill, became affiliated with the National Woman's Party. Women's rights leader Alice Paul consulted both Pound and Levitt in seeking to draft what became known as the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), to give equality to women without eroding special protections. Dean Pound was willing to help, so long as his involvement was not publicized. Levitt, seeking to avoid conflict with existing laws protecting women, drafted at least 75 versions of the ERA for Paul. He also consulted with future Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, who was then counsel to the Washington, D.C. Minimum Wage Board, who commented on various drafts, feeling that any version of the ERA would have the side effect of eviscerating current legal protections for women. Levitt attempted to change Frankfurter's mind, but was unsuccessful. He wrote to Paul, \\"The net result of the interview is nothing.\\" Although both Pound and Frankfurter had given Levitt advice on condition that their names not be used, NWP activists falsely claimed that they had approved the text of the ERA as suitable for either legislation or constitutional amendment. Levitt apologized to both, and wrote Paul that he could not now consult anyone he trusted about the ERA for fear of being betrayed again. Nevertheless, influenced by Hill, he continued his work for Paul until the end of 1921. On December 24, 1921, by now working at the University of North Dakota, he married Hill in Chicago. (fee for article) Legal and teaching career Levitt served a year teaching assignments in law at George Washington University and the University of North Dakota before returning to school himself at Yale University, receiving his J.D. in 1923. From 1923 to 1924, he served as a Special Assistant Attorney General. In 1924, he was hired as assistant professor of law at Washington and Lee University. He made a deep impression there as, according to the school's web site, \\"likely the most unusual, colorful, and, some would contend, eccentric law teacher in the history of Washington and Lee\\" but also as a \\"teacher of great ability\\". His wife retained her maiden name and their daughter was known by the surname \\"Hill-Levitt\\", unconventional for the conservative southern town of Lexington, Virginia. Levitt also was involved in conflict with the law school dean, and when his contract expired in 1927, it was not renewed. Levitt next taught law at St. Lawrence University and followed that up with a stint at the New York University School of Commerce and changed coasts to teach at the Hastings School of Law. Governmental, political, and judicial career Levitt was for many years a resident of Connecticut and involved himself in affairs there, getting the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut to order the state's attorney general to take action against railroads for failure to eliminate at-grade crossings as required by law. Levitt ran in 1932 for Governor of Connecticut as an Independent Republican, but failed to receive the nomination. (fee for article) From 1933 to 1935, Levitt again served as a special assistant attorney general. In 1935, Levitt was appointed as judge of the District Court for the Virgin Islands. He stated in an interview that he did not intend to be a public spectacle, but to live a lonely life. Levitt was interviewed by the local paper, which indicated that he brought a dog and a special supply of tropical dog food for him to assuage the loneliness. He was sworn in on October 17. (fee for article) He also brought Elsie Hill, who busied herself with local women's affairs and was outraged to learn that under Danish Colonial Law, still mostly in force in the Virgin Islands, local women could not vote. According to one local woman, Hill told women activists that if they brought suit, her husband would uphold the right of women to vote in the possession. Hill obtained a prominent New York attorney to represent the islanders without fee, and in November, Judge Levitt ruled the disenfranchisement unconstitutional under the Nineteenth Amendment. The local electoral board still refused to register women, and the following month, Judge Levitt issued a writ of mandamus, forcing the board to comply. In 1936, Judge Levitt, in response to the Governor's pardon (which included a lengthy harangue against the judge) of a convict he had sentenced, resigned from his post and returned to his position at the Justice Department, where he remained until 1937. Levitt arrives at the Supreme Court to challenge the seating of Hugo Black, October 3, 1937 In 1937, Levitt filed a petition in the Supreme Court of the United States, seeking to block the seating of new appointee, Senator Hugo Black. Levitt argued that as Black's predecessor on the Court, Justice Willis Van Devanter, had only retired, and not resigned (a new law had permitted retirement), there was no vacancy, and as that the retirement law had increased the emoluments of the office, Black was ineligible under the Incompatibility Clause of the Constitution. In the decision, Ex parte Levitt, the Court found that Levitt's standing, as a citizen and member of the Supreme Court Bar, was not sufficient to allow him to challenge the seating of Black. When he heard of the decision, Levitt quoted from the Book of Job: \\"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him; but I will maintain my own ways before Him.\\" In 1956, Levitt wrote to Justice Black that although he opposed the nomination he admired Black and was grateful to Black for his \\"continuous defense and elucidation of our civil rights.\\"Levitt to Black, December 9, 1956, Hugo Black Papers, Library of Congress, Box 38 Later life Levitt ran twice for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate. He ran in California in 1950, on an anti-Catholic platform. He finished sixth out of sixth in the primary, behind the winner, Congressman Richard Nixon, three cross-filing Democrats, and another fringe candidate. In 1960, Levitt, running unsuccessfully for the Senate from New Hampshire, telegraphed Pope John XXIII and asked him to clarify whether Senator John F. Kennedy, a Catholic who was seeking the Democratic nomination for President, owed political allegiance to the Vatican or to the United States. According to Levitt's research, some 150 principles of the Roman Catholic Church conflicted with the Constitution. There is no record of any reply by the Pope. Levitt divorced Elsie Hill in 1956, and later remarried. He died in 1968.

It collects and correlates events from existing disparate security devices and information systems (video, access control, sensors, analytics, networks, building systems, etc.) to empower personnel to identify and proactively resolve situations. PSIM integration enables numerous organizational benefits, including increased control, improved situation awareness and management reporting. Ultimately, these solutions allow organizations to reduce costs through improved efficiency and to improve security through increased intelligence. A complete PSIM software system has six key capabilities: # Collection: Device management independent software collects data from any number of disparate security devices or systems. # Analysis: The system analyzes and correlates the data, events, and alarms, to identify the real situations and their priority. # Verification: PSIM software presents the relevant situation information in a quick and easily digestible format for an operator to verify the situation. # Resolution: The system provides standard operating procedures (SOPs), step-by-step instructions based on best practices and an organization‚Äôs policies, and tools to resolve the situation. # Reporting: The PSIM software tracks all the information and steps for compliance reporting, training and potentially, in-depth investigative analysis. # Audit trail: The PSIM also monitors how each operator interacts with the system, tracks any manual changes to security systems and calculates reaction times for each event. PSIM-based integration A key differential between PSIM based integration and other forms of physical security system integration is the ability for a PSIM platform to connect systems at a data level, contrasting other forms of integration which interface a limited number of products. PSIM allows use of open technologies which are compatible with a large number of manufacturers. These PSIM products offer more opportunities for expansion and can reduce implementation costs through greater use of existing equipment. PSIM solutions in general are deployed to centralize information to single or multiple control hubs. These are referred to as control rooms or command and control centres (CCC, C4I, etc.). To be connected with other technologies, is an important feature of any basic PSIM as is the capability to integrate with Open Industry Standards such as (PSIA, ONVIF, ODBC, etc.) Security systems typically integrated into a PSIM solution include: * Access control systems * Automated barriers and bollards * Building management systems like Heating, HVAC, lifts/elevators control, etc. * CCTV (closed circuit TV) * Computer Aided Dispatch systems * Electronic article surveillance (EAS) * Fire detection * GIS mapping systems * Intercom and IP phone * Intrusion detection system * Intrusion systems * Lighting control system * Perimeter intrusion detection systems * Power monitoring system * Radar-based detection and perimeter surveillance radar * Security alarm * Video content analysis * Video wall Operator guidance PSIM solutions manage all of the data produced by the various security applications (where the security application manufacturers API or SDK allows), and aggregates them to produce meaningful intelligence. This in turn is converted to create graphical situation management content; combining relevant visual intelligence, workflow based on on-screen guidance and automated tasks (also referred to as a Common Operating Interface). This is used for both event management and for day to day security operations. Some of the more advanced PSIM products offer dynamic guidance, which can be changed according to the perceived threat level. This threat level is governed by both external intelligence, such as DHS advice and internal intelligence, such as the number of attempted breaches. This level of dynamic guidance again relies on the level of integration achieved with any given manufacturers API or SDK. Typical deployments PSIM solutions can be found in a wide range of industry and government sectors across the globe. The following are industries where PSIM deployments can be found; * Corporate enterprise * Critical national infrastructure protection * Education * Energy, oil & gas * Healthcare * Homeland defense * Industrial & manufacturing * Law enforcement * Retail & distribution * Safe Cities * Travel & transportation Examples of PSIM deployments: * Atlanta Police Foundation and the Atlanta Police Department: Operation Shield Video Integration Center * British Transport Police * City of Baltimore: CitiWatch video surveillance program * Ventura Police Department: Video Camera Community Partnership Program * Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) IT convergence A key reason for the increased deployment of this technology has been its ability to bridge the gap between the security and information technology functions within organisations. Security applications and devices have until very recently been only available on proprietary technologies, which reduce the ability to use multiple vendors and have created vendor lock in pricing strategies. This opposes IT standards, where plug and play technology has allowed a greater choice of hardware and has helped reduce hardware costs. PSIM enables a greater degree of this type of interoperability, and comes at a time when security applications and devices are moving from analogue to network based connectivity. The combined effect has seen PSIM solutions score highly with IT departments globally, especially those that are database independent and simple to update with new devices and users. Security at board level The function of security departments has traditionally been to secure people and buildings, and has been slow to absorb new technology, relying more on manned guards and physical barriers. As Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) evolves to address all security and legislative risks across all stakeholders, physical security departments have come under increased scrutiny. Numerous examples of physical security breaches leading to major organizational losses, both in terms of assets and brand damage have led to physical security reporting to board level. Globally, new roles have been created within large organizations where Chief Information Security Officers (CISO), have responsibility for ERM, including physical security. Subsequently, management reporting, policy compliance and KPIs have entered the physical security function, requiring more efficient working practices and monitoring tools. Again PSIM software addresses these organizational requirements, and is therefore being stipulated by CISOs.

A pre-war Regia Aeronautica Italian Air Force base, the airfield was a primary objective of the Operation Husky landings. After being secured, it was used by the United States Army Air Forces Twelfth Air Force 31st Fighter Group, equipped with three squadrons (307th, 308th 309th) of Supermarine Spitfires. Later, it was a command and control base for the 52d Troop Carrier Wing from 1 September 1943-13 February 1944. The airfield is also notable because many Italian Air Force airplanes landed at Agrigento in the days immediately following the armistice between Italy and the Allied armed forces in early September 1943. The Regia Aeronautica 8¬∞ Gruppo Macchi C.200 fighters landed at Agrigento on 13 September. Most were worn out and obsolete, no longer useful for combat, however Italian crews scrounged any parts that they could to keep their aircraft flying against the Germans. Later, the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force (ICBAF or ACI) was formed and incorporated these aircraft. After the American use of the base ended, it was turned over to the Italian Air Force for its use. Today, the site of the airfield is abandoned, although several runways and what appears to be a former sports facility (also abandoned) is visible at the former airfield site.
