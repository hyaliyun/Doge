It was once two adjacent reserves formally known as Hudson Park and Angophora Reserve, however the two were merged and are now referred together under the one title of Angophora Reserve. It borders the suburbs of Avalon, Clareville and Taylors Point and provides a refuge for native fauna and flora and serves as a wildlife corridor. The reserve also contains an Aboriginal shelter site that holds both archaeological and cultural significance and is one of the most important of such sites in the Sydney region.  History  Angophora Reserve was purchased as a bushland sanctuary by the Wildlife Preservation Society in 1937. The reserve's original purpose was to preserve a giant Angophora Red Gum tree, which is estimated to be 1,000 years old. The tree still stands today but is now dead. Sir Philip Whistler Street officially opened the reserve on 19 March 1938 during an opening ceremony that took place under the giant Angophora tree. The adjoining Hudson Park was established as a public reserve in 1957. The Angophora Reserve and Hudson Park Management Committee was formed in 1976 to aid in the management of the neighbouring reserves. It remained active until it was disbanded after the Council elections in September 1991 and was succeeded by the Pittwater Reserves and Bushland Management Committee following the creation of the Pittwater Council. In 1989 Angophora Reserve and Hudson Park were registered on the now defunct Register of the National Estate in 1987 due to it being a bushland sanctuary of significant social, recreational and educational value to the Northern Beaches region.

Serving first as a soldier in the First World War, Adams joined the newly formed RAF in 1918, serving in the RAF for over 25 years. His career as a first-class cricketer with the Royal Air Force cricket team ran from 1928-1932, prior to that he had represented his native Dorset at minor counties level. Early life, WWI and inter-war years Adams was born to Blanche Annie Adams and Lionel Lincoln Adams at Parkstone, Dorset. He was educated at Parkstone Grammar School. Having served from 1915 in the British Army during World War I, Adams joined the newly formed Royal Air Force in July 1918 as a second lieutenant in the General Duties Branch. After the war, he gained the rank of probationary pilot officer in August 1919, with promotion to flying officer coming the following month. In 1922, Adams began playing minor counties cricket for Dorset. He played for Dorset in the Minor Counties Championship on 21 occasions from 1922-1928. Adams' minor counties career was intermittent due to his RAF service, which saw him overseas serving in Iraq Command in 1925. In January 1927, Adams achieved the rank of flight lieutenant. He made his debut in first-class cricket for the Royal Air Force against the Royal Navy at The Oval in 1928, making five first- class appearances for the Royal Air Force from 1928-1932. He totalled 173 runs and 11 wickets across his five match first-class career. By 1936, Adams was the commanding officer of No. 15 Squadron, having achieved the rank of squadron leader at some point prior to 1936. In 1938, he was serving at Bomber Command, with promotion to wing commander coming in January of the following year, where upon he was placed in position as commanding officer of No. 38 Squadron in February 1939. WWII and post-war With the onset of World War II, No. 38 Squadron became part of No. 3 Group RAF. Adams obtained the rank of acting group captain in 1940, a rank he would retain for the remainder of the war. He held several commands during the war, including RAF Kemble, RAF Oakington, RAF Abingdon, RAF Marston Moor, and RAF North Luffenham. In November 1941, Adams was commended for bravery when a plane crashed on the airfield he was serving in. Circling the airfield in his car at the time, Adams arrived first on the scene and proceeded to enter the burning plane, rescuing a seriously injured airman aboard and recovering the body of another. As a result, he was awarded an OBE for gallantry. In July 1945, with the war in Europe over, Adams was transferred to British India, where he commanded RAF Santacruz in Bombay until 1946, by which time he had achieved the rank of acting air commodore. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1948 New Year Honours. He achieved the full rank of air commodore on 16 November 1949, retiring from the RAF the next day. He died at Milford on Sea, Hampshire, on 19 August 1988. Beyond playing cricket for the RAF, he also represented it in rugby union and athletics. He married three times during his life, with his first marriage producing two children.

The Sengwer are sometimes portrayed as a component of the Marakwet people but are a distinct ethnic grouping. The Sengwer people are currently a marginalized community and face significant threats to their identity and ancestral lands. International and human rights organizations including the United Nations, Amnesty International and the Kenya Human Rights Commission recognize the Sengwer as indigenous peoples whose claim to the area goes back hundreds of years and have repeatedly raised concerns about human rights violations against them. History Pre-19th century =Etymology= Following his Juba expedition, MacDonald (1899) noted of the 'Senguer' who previously 'dwelt on the Guash Ngishu plateau' stating that 'As \\"l\\" and \\"r\\" are interchangeable, \\"Senguer\\" of the Juba expedition is evidently the same word as \\"Jangwel\\", a term which Mr. C. Hobley found was applied by the Nandi to designate their tribe\\". In recorded accounts of the colonial era in Kenya, the people today known as Sengwer usually referred to themselves as such. Other accounts on the etymology consider the name a derivation from Karimajong. The Karimajong came to refer to them by the name of the cowrie shell ornament that Sengwer women of the 1700s and 1800s adorned themselves with - a dangling cowrie shell referred to as esigirait, pl. ngisigira in Karimojong. They thus came to be known as Siger, Sigerai, Segelai and Losegelai in some accounts. =Territory= At its largest extent, Sengwer territory covered the northern parts of Uasin Gishu, as well as parts of Elgeyo-Marakwet, Trans Nzoia and a southern section of West Pokot; =Way of life= The Sengwer prior to the 19th century herded a distinctive type of long-horned black cattle, postulated by Lamphear (1994) as being a cervicothoraic-humped Sanga crossbreed. During this period, social groupings similar in concept to clans seem to have played a role in the social organisation of the Sengwer. One of these 'clans' was known as the Kacepkai. This clan was displaced during the Turkana invasion of Moru Assiger and were said to have become the diviners of a number of different peoples in the Mt. Elgon region. The Sengwer are credited with great mystical abilities and divination appears to have played a large role in their culture. The confederacy gave rise to the Meturona line of diviners among the Turkana, the Kachepkai diviners of the Pokot and the Talai diviners of the Uas Nkishu Maasai, the Nandi and Kipsigis. The most notable element of Sengwer culture was an adornment of a single cowrie shell attached to the forelock of Sengwer women, a hairstyle that was also common to the Oropom who neighbored them to the west and north-west. This dangling cowrie shell was referred to as esigirait, pl. ngisigira and it is from this cultural feature that the Sengwer are said to have derived their name. 19th century Towards the end of the 18th century, a drought captured in folklore as the Aoyate - the long dry time, struck. It appears that the factors that resulted in famine combined to decimate Sengwer identity. The long-horned cattle that the Sengwer kept were devastated by the Aoyate drought. The drought decimated the Sengwer herds and the community disintegrated. Many famine refugees who tried to push eastwards died of starvation near Moru Eris, though some found refuge with the Dassanetch, Pokot and Karimojong. To the north, Ateker societies, notably the emerging Turkana who lived on the borders of Sengwer territory, began encroaching on Sengwer highland pastures. These societies led a radically different way of life to the Sengwer, a spartanly pastoral world view based on their early possession of hardy thoraic-humped Zebus that were much more resistant to heat stress, drought and disease. The Turkana had bordered the Sengwer for some time and their initial interactions had been peaceful though conflict, likely spurred by the drought, developed towards the end of the 18th century. Large parts of the Sengwer community, already decimated by the drought, were absorbed into the growing Turkana identity, becoming a territorial section known as Siger and probably forming several new Turkana clans, including the Siger, Swalika and Ngoleroto clans. According to Maasai tradition, the Chemngal were attacked by an alliance of the Uasin Gishu and Siria Loikop communities. To the east, rivalry was also developing with the Loikop (also known as 'Kor'), a Maa-speaking alliance that lived in close associations with various Cushitic-speaking peoples. Like the Turkana, the Kor kept some of the hardy Zebus which allowed them to withstand the Aoyate a lot better than the Sengwer and to absorb members of the community as their society collapsed. To the south, some refugees were fleeing Turkana advances, who were raiding south into the Uasin Gishu where they were known as Kakesira, and can be associated with the Losegelai (Siger = Sigerai = Segelai) Maasai of the late 19th and early 20th century. Small numbers of Sengwer retreated into the forests and into small enclaves among the emerging Marakwet society where they retained elements of their identity. The Maasai coined a derogatory term for the Sengwer after they lost their cattle. 20th century By the early 20th century, Recent history The Sengwer continues to be a marginalized community that is facing separate and significant threats to both its identity and ancestral lands in the present time. By 1980, the pressures of population growth of forest dwelling communities in Kenya, among them the Sengwer, came against the governments desire and efforts to control the forests. Repeated eviction attempts have been carried out since then. On 16 January 2018 herder Robert Kirotich was shot and killed and David Kipkosgei Kiptilkesi was injured by Kenya Forest Service officers. The Sengwer men were herding their cattle at the time. Both were unarmed. As of January 17, 2018, the European Union suspended its financial support for the Kenyan Government's Water Towers Protection and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Programme (WATER), as a result of ongoing abuses of the human rights of indigenous people in the conservation areas. On 22 January 2018, a court in Eldoret issued an injunction requiring the government to stop the evictions until the Sengwer community's case was heard on 27 February 2018. As of October, 2018, the Sengwar were preparing an international petition to be taken to the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights in Arusha, Tanzania.

The monument is 2.3 m high and consists of a circular hole near its base measuring 43 cm in diameter. The megalithic stone is located in the garden of Tolvan Cross Cottage, near the village of Gweek in Cornwall, England. The holed stone is the largest of its kind in Cornwall. Description The Tolvan holed stone is a large triangular-shaped standing stone. It measures 2.3 m high, 2.3 m wide at the base, and is 0.3 m thick. Near the base of the monument is a circular hole, approximately 43 cm in diameter. The standing stone is located about 800 m north of the village of Gweek in Cornwall, England, behind the farmhouse at Tolvan Cross. The megalith is not in its original location, but was moved to its current position in 1847 A cottage was later built at the site. The Tolvan stone is the largest holed stone in Cornwall. History Holed stones are rare Neolithic monuments. It has been suggested that the large standing stones were part of megalithic structures, used as entrance passages to the burial chambers of portal dolmens. These standing stones are believed to have been constructed in the Early and Middle Neolithic period (3500 - 2600 BC). At least 20 portal dolmens exist in Britain, and the majority of these burial monuments are found in west Cornwall. \\"Tolvan\\" originated from the term, \\"Tol- vean\\", meaning holed stone. The Tolvan holed stone is mentioned in historical records in Cornwall in 1649, and is referred to as the \\"Main-toll great stone\\". The triangular standing stone was moved from its original position to its current location in 1847. At the time, the stone was 2.6 m high by 2.7 m wide, but was modified to fit through gateposts when it was transported. At the stone's original location, a stone-lined circular pit, 1.5 m diameter, and covered with a large slab was discovered before 1864. The pit was lined with slabs and held quartz stone and pottery fragments. Historians at the time determined that the pit was a grave, and the holed stone was part of an ancient dolmen. Next to the circular pit was a trough-shaped stone called the \\"Cradle\\", which was subsequently destroyed. In 1885, it was recorded that one of the local traditions concerning the stone involved passing sick children through the hole in the Tolvan stone in hopes of curing their illness.

According to Quaker researcher Jenny Madeline, William John Baker was a trustee for the Quaker Burial Ground established at Rookwood Necropolis in 1902 following the resumption of the Devonshire Street Cemetery for Central railway station. He had had another house built to the design of Nixon and Allen at 37 Kuringai Ave Turramurra in 1897.Reith and Madeline, 2006 Cossington Smith later would say that the house at Turramurra had been designed for \\"'Mr Baker the Quaker' as a dwelling that could also function as a Quaker lodge, a kind of church\\".Thomas, 2005, 157 *1910 Cossington Smith attends art classes with Dattilo Rubbo in Sydney. *1912-14 Cossington Smith travels to Europe, attending art classes in England and Germany. *1913 Ernest and Grace Smith rent the house at 43 Ku-Ring-Gai Ave Turramurra from Mr Baker. *1914 Cossington Smith rejoins her family in the new home at Turramurra. She would live at Cossington for the next 65 years. *1914 Cossington Smith's father builds a small studio in the garden for her to paint in, as she recalled: \\"father was a dear, so was my mother; both of them were keen about my painting, and my father built me that dear little studio down at the bottom of the garden, a perfect studio\\".Hart, 2005, 11 *1915 Cossington Smith exhibits \\"The Sock Knitter\\", an important early work of modern Australian art, based on her sister Madge seated at Cossington. It is later described by Daniel Thomas as \\"perhaps the first fully Post Impressionist work painted in Australia\\".Johnson, 1995, p.451 *1920 Ernest Smith buys the Turramurra house, renaming it Cossington. Ernest and Grace had also given this name to their first house in Wycombe Road Neutral Bay - \\"in memory of the Leicestershire parish where Grace Fisher's father had been Rector\\".Modjeska, 1999, 214 *1928 At the age of 36 Cossington Smith holds her first solo art exhibition at the Grosvenor Galleries. From 1932 she would hold a further 18 solo exhibitions at the Macquarie Galleries in Sydney. She would also participate in many group exhibitions and be awarded the Order of the British Empire and appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia. *1931 Cossington Smith's mother passes away. *1938 Cossington Smith's father passes away on 29 September. *1939 Grace and two sisters move out to lodgings in a house nearby in Womerah Street for a few months while \\"a large well-lit studio was added to the house, to which other minor alterations were also made by the architect Bertram Chisholm\\".Thomas, 1973 and Thomas, personal communication, 2006 The studio in the garden gradually deteriorates (considered to be in dangerous state of ill- repair by the late 1970s, it is demolished by Cossington Smith's niece after 1979). The original door from the garden studio is moved to the house-based studio. *1962 Cossington Smith's last surviving sibling Charlotte passes away, leaving Cossington to live alone at Cossington for the next 17 years. *1973 A major retrospective exhibition of Cossington Smith's work is curated by Daniel Thomas at the Art Gallery of New South Wales and tours nationally in all mainland states. *1979 Cossington Smith moves from Cossington to live in a nursing home in Roseville. *1984 Cossington Smith passes away on 20 December. She leaves Cossington to her brother's three children, one of which, Ann Mills, has already been living there since 1979. Ann's brother and sister sell their shares of the house to Ann, happy to keep the house within the family. *2005 A major retrospective of Cossington Smith's work is curated by Deborah Hart at the National Gallery of Australia and tours nationally. Comments by art historians  Description  Cossington entrance, pictured in 2005. A Federation period home with fine timber detailing and an unusual timber lined meeting room.National Trust listing card, 1985 A large single storey Federation style house constructed of red open kiln bricks with blue brick dressings along the line of the window ledges and above the windows. Mitre slate roof with lead ridging. There are four decorative chimneys of red and blue bricks. Strong veranda details include turned posts, delicately incised timber brackets and lattice valance. The interior features an impressive kauri board lined central meeting room with a fine cedar screen with decorative leadlight panels and a rough hewn stone fire surround. The house stands in a mature garden of dense-leafed evergreens, pines, azaleas and camellias, with a wide gravel brick-edged drive in good condition. The front fence repeats the style and structure of many fences in Ku-Ring-Gai Avenue, with overlapping palings and squared timber coping. There are heavy wrought iron gates in rectangular and diamond pattern. The door from the new kitchen (previous spare bedroom) to the back veranda is original and unusual in that the joinery makes the shape of a cross (this may be a remnant of significance to the original Quaker occupants). The door into Cossington Smith's former studio (in the south eastern corner of the house) is significant as it had been the door to her studio in the garden and was moved to its new position when she moved the studio into the house. =Moveable heritage= The major dark wood furniture in the dining room is largely the same as when Cossington Smith lived there - a large bookcase with many art books that had been owned by Cossington Smith, the dining table and chairs and the large sideboard, as well as the mantle clock over the original fireplace. This room also contains its original french doors leading from the living room to the back veranda, making it perhaps the most intact room in the house. In the living room, the original fireplace is graced with its original mantle clock and two period drawings of GCS's forebears titled \\"Great grandfather Smith\\" and \\"Great grandmother\\". Modifications since 1979 are minor and largely reversible if desired. = Modifications and dates = *1899 - House built, used for Quaker meetings. *1913 - House first rented by Ernest and Grace Smith, who renamed it \\"Cossington\\" when Ernest bought it in 1920. Between 1913 and his death in 1938 Ernest added a verandah and entrance vestibule to the front facade of the house, moving the front door from the south side of the house to the west side; added a tennis court to the back yard; and built a studio for Cossington Smith to work in, in the north eastern corner of the back garden. *1938 to 1979 - Cossington Smith moves her studio into the house, extending the south side of the house in 1939 to incorporate it as a new room, and at the same time extending the bedroom on the other side of the hall (\\"Madge's bedroom\\"). These minor modifications are designed by the architect Bertram Chisholm.Thomas, Daniel. 2006 Cossington Smith and her sisters sell the second block of land behind the house which was depicted in \\"Bonfire in the Bush\\" 1937. A large liquid amber tree is now situated in about the same place as where the three sisters stood in the painting. *1979 to 2006 - Cossington Smith moves to a nursing home and her niece Ann Mills moves into the house with her family. The Mills demolish a garage on the north front facade, add a car port on the south front facade and put in a circular drive. They also demolish Cossington Smith's derelict studio in the back garden, not having been used for 40 years. The kitchen is moved from the north western corner of the house to the north eastern corner of the house, replacing what had been a spare bedroom known as the Blue Room (or sewing room) plus laundry, linen cupboard and hall. On the advice of insurers the Mills replace the French doors in the bedrooms with windows. A new doorway is cut into the main bedroom, which had been Cossington Smith's room, to give access to the bathroom. To make room for a double bed in this room, the fireplace is also removed and a built-in wardrobe added. The room behind the car port, which had been Cossington Smith's studio, is extended and glass sliding door added. The tennis court is enlarged and its grass surfacing replaced with artificial surface. The original back veranda is raised 18 inches (40 cm) to meet Council regulations. In 1991 a large gumtree in the back garden falls over in a huge storm, without major damage to property. In recent years, the wooden lining of the Quakers' Room (the living room and dining room) has been extensively cleaned (after appearing nearly black after a century collecting soot from the fireplaces); also the doors and leadlighting have been carefully restored. The slate roof has been restored. The back veranda has been extended.  Heritage listing  As at 27 September 2006, as the adult home of Grace Cossington Smith and the subject of many of her finest paintings, Cossington is of State heritage significance for its association with this outstanding twentieth century Australian artist. Cossington is also of State significance for its association with women's history in NSW in so far as Cossington Smith's art works represent an especially feminine perspective on Australian culture - as viewed from the interior of an upper middle-class suburban house. Cossington is also of local heritage significance for its unusual timber-lined meeting room originally used for Quaker meetings, for its associations with Cossington Smith's eminent lawyer father Ernest Smith, for its architectural qualities as a Federation bungalow designed by Nixon & Allen, and for its garden contributing to the streetscape. \\"I am not sure there is another artist in the entire history of Australian art for whom there can be the same two-fold association of firstly, a house in which the artist lived for entirety of a career - more than six decades - and secondly, where the interior structure itself - ie the rooms inside - formed the basis of subject matter pursued with magnificent and profoundly spiritual dedication over that time.\\" Cossington was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 August 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Cossington is likely to be of State heritage significance for its association with women's history in NSW. Cossington Smith's art works represent a widespread but especially feminine perspective on Australian culture - as viewed from the interior of an upper middle-class suburban house. Cossington is also likely to be considered of at least local heritage significance for its historical relationship with the Quakers in NSW. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. As the adult home of Grace Cossington Smith and the subject of many of her finest paintings, Cossington is of State heritage significance for its association with this leading twentieth century Australian artist. Cossington is also of local heritage significance for its previous use as a Quaker meeting house, still apparent in the wooden lined ceilings in the room now used as living room and dining room. Cossington is also of local heritage significance for its association with Cossington Smith's father Ernest Augustus Smith, a lawyer who was the NSW Solicitor General 1891-1894 (before buying the house). He also led his professional association of notaries the for a time. \\"The profession, and the community service, might be considered characteristic of those who lived in the highland suburbs on the North Shore Line\\". The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Cossington is of local heritage significance for its architectural qualities as a Federation bungalow designed by Dixon & Adam, and for its garden and contribution to the streetscape. The room that was the Quaker meeting room is also of aesthetic significance for its impressive kauri-board ceilings with fine cedar screen and decorative leadlight panels, as well as its rough hewn stone fireplaces. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As the long-time home of one of Australia's leading artists and the subject of many of her finest paintings, Cossington is of State significance with respect to its research potential for art historians.

It was designed by Arthur Baldwinson and built from 1958 to 1962 by George M. Koch. It is also known as Simpson Lee House. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 November 2009.  History  =The House= Simpson-Lee House I Wahroonga was commissioned by Professor Geelum and Mrs. Sheila Simpson-Lee and designed by Arthur Baldwinson in 1957. Construction took place in two stages, the first during 1958 and again in 1962. The house was small and built in two stages as it was built utilising loans available under the University Housing Scheme. The house represents the evolution of Baldwinson's thinking beyond his earlier European influenced designs into a more site-responsive, locally adapted modernism which in this case, particularly flowed through the co- operation of literate, informed clients.Robert Moore Assessment, 2000 The design of the house reflects the needs and sensibility of the clients and their own sophisticated understanding of architecture even though they had no formal architectural training. The Simpson-Lees originally were drawn to the work of Sydney Ancher however Geelum's sister who worked for the Institute of Architects suggested they might like the work of Arthur Baldwinson who also happened to work with Geelum at Sydney University. Professor and Mrs Simpson- Lee have lived in the house since it was built. Professor Simpson-Lee died but Mrs Simpson Lee remains in the house and it is retained much as it was when it was first built, including the majority of the contents. The garden has also been maintained as was originally designed. =The architect= Arthur Baldwinson (1908 -1969) is one of Australia's first generation of prominent modernist architects who experienced the European modernist movement first hand. From 1932 until 1937 Baldwinson spent time in London where he worked for Maxwell Fry and as a full-time assistant to Walter Gropius, developing a unique and intimate understanding of the theories of modern architecture. This experience of working in London with two of the early twentieth century's most important architects, greatly influenced Baldwinson' s design philosophy for the remainder of his professional life working in architecture. Baldwinson returned to Australia in 1937 determined to plant the flag of \\"the new architecture\\". Before the 1939-45 War he played a pioneer role in the formation of an Australian MARS (Modern Architecture Research Society) group, the Design and Industries Association (DIA) and the design of modernist houses drawing on his London experience. During World War II, Baldwinson worked for the Commonwealth Aircraft Factory designing and constructing buildings for the manufacture of the Beaufort Bomber. By 1943, he was Chief Architect for the Beaufort Division. Baldwinson later developed an all-steel pre-fabricated \\"Beaufort\\" house for post-war sale to the Victorian Housing Commission in 1946. He also had his own practice and in 1938 designed the ground breaking Collins house at Palm Beach. According to Greg Holman ( Author of Thesis on Baldwinson) only the Prevost house by Sydney Ancher exhibited a similar level of understanding of the modern movement at time. Commencing practice with Eric Gibson, an engineer in 1946, Baldwinson soon began designing what became known as the \\"Artists\\" houses. He designed houses and studios for Douglas Annand, William Dobell, Max Dupain, Geoff and Dahl Collings, Alistair Morrison, Brett Porter, Elaine Haxton, Desiderius Orban and Russell Drysdale. He concluded his partnership with Gibson in 1950 and formed a partnership with Charles Vernon Sylvester-Booth in 1953; later Charles Peters joined them in 1956 to form Baldwinson, Booth and Peters. This practice lasted until 1958. Their Hotel Belmont, in the Newcastle suburb of Belmont won the 1956 NSW RAIA Sulman Award for a public building. Baldwinson also designed the Mandl House, Wahroonga (1953) and the Simpson-Lee House, Wahroonga (1958) during this partnership. Supported by his teaching salary, Baldwinson designed and built his own residence at 79 Carlotta Street, Greenwich (1954). Baldwinson formed a new partnership with recent Sydney University graduate Geoffrey Twibill which was to last until late 1959. In 1960, Baldwinson closed his formal practice but continued to work on commissions. He designed the Hauslaib House, Point Piper (1960), the Pennington House, Whale Beach (1960), the Robinson House, Castle Cove (1963) and his last completed house for the artist Desiderius Orban, Northwood (1968) He became a Senior Lecturer in the University of Sydney architecture faculty In 1952 where he remained until his death. In his later years, Baldwinson devoted himself to teaching and travel. In 1969 he died in Sydney from congestive heart failure. A member of the first Australian generation of modernist architects, his contemporaries include Roy Grounds (1905-1981) and Frederick Romberg (1910-1992) in Victoria and Sydney Ancher (1904- 1979) and Walter Bunning (1912-1977) in NSW. Their respective Australian architectural careers in modernism began in the late 1930s. Baldwinson's palette of materials was consistent throughout his practice: bagged brick, weatherboard or horizontal tongue & groove cladding, irregular ashlar-laid sandstone and concrete. Although his practice was occasionally involved in commercial commissions, his greatest accomplishments lie in the adaptation of the principles and materials of European modernism for the small-scale suburban Australian house. He helped to pioneer free-plan concepts, the \\"scientific kitchen\\", flat roof treatments and function-derived placement of windows and doors. (RAIA Nomination) Baldwinson is an important Australian architect, taking his place with the best of twentieth century Australian architects, such as Sydney Ancher and Harry Seidler.  Description  Rear elevation Rear deck with handrail seat Approach to the house Glenn Murcutt's description of the site for Ku-Ring-Gai Council, 1998: = Condition = As at 4 June 2009, the house is well-maintained and extraordinarily intact, retaining its wealth of original Baldwinson detail including the original colour scheme. Excellent, sound and intact condition. = Modifications and dates = The building is intact down to its original finishes and furnishings. The roof membrane has been replaced. = Further information = The original documentation for the house including architectural drawings, specifications and colour schemes are held in the Caroline Simpson Library of the Historic Houses Trust. There is a complete collection of Arthur Baldwinson papers in the Mitchell Library.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Dating from 1957, Simpson-Lee House I Wahroonga is of State significance as an excellent and intact example of the work of early modernist architect Arthur Baldwinson. One of the earliest proponents of modernism in NSW, Baldwinson was responsible for bringing the sophistication of European modernism to Australia and developing it into a locally adapted, site responsive architecture. Having worked as assistant to international architects Walter Gropius and Maxwell Fry whilst in London, Baldwinson gained an understanding of modernism which he then translated into the Australian environment. Through his architecture and the establishment of the Modern Architecture Research Society (MARS) which he founded with Walter Bunning, Morton Herman and others he influenced his contemporaries and future generations of Australian architects. The Simpson-Lee house represents an excellent example of Baldwinson's architecture and is likely to be the most intact of all his buildings. Demonstrating an innovative approach to the incorporation of outdoor spaces, sensitive to the environment and place, it is a benchmark house for the manner in which the interior and exterior is integrated. Simpson-Lee House I is likely to be of State significance for its research value as a resource that demonstrates many features of modernist architecture and design in theory and practice, and especially for its capacity to illuminate the work of Baldwinson. It is also likely to be of State significance for being an excellent representative example of mid twentieth century Australian modernist residential design, complete with intact interiors and garden setting. Simpson-Lee House I Wahroonga is highly regarded as an outstanding work of architecture by the architectural profession, a house which was aesthetically distinctive for its time and now exemplifies an architectural style. Simpson-Lee House I was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 November 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Simpson-Lee House I Wahroonga is of State significance for its role in the history of Australian architecture and house design. As an exemplary piece of modernism springing from first hand experience with European modernism but adapted so successfully to the Australian climate it reflects changing attitudes to architecture at a residential level in mid twentieth century NSW. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Simpson-Lee House I Wahroonga is of State significance for its historical associations with the prominent modernist architect Arthur Baldwinson. One of the earliest proponents of modernism in NSW Baldwinson was responsible for bringing the sophistication of European modernism to Australia and developing it into a locally adapted, site responsive architecture. Having worked as assistant to international architects Walter Gropius and Maxwell Fry whilst in London, Baldwinson gained an understanding of modernism which he then translated into the Australian environment. Through his architecture and the establishment of the Modern Architecture Research Society (MARS) which he founded with Walter Bunning, Morton Herman and others he influenced his contemporaries and future generations of Australian architects. Also significant is the association with Geelum and Sheila Simpson-Lee, the clients, who are historically important for their role as patrons of modern architecture. The Simpson-Lee's commissioned both the house in Wahroonga by Baldwinson and a house in Mount Wilson by Glenn Murcutt which has emerged as one of his finest works to date, a factor he attributes to the contribution of his clients. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Simpson-Lee House I Wahroonga is of State significance as an excellent and intact example of the work of early modernist architect Arthur Baldwinson. It is an excellent example of mid twentieth century modern domestic architecture in Australia. It has aesthetic value arising from its design, setting and completeness in presentation. The house represents the evolution of Baldwinson's thinking beyond his earlier European influenced designs into a more site-responsive, locally adapted Modernism. Demonstrating an innovative approach to the incorporation of outdoor spaces, sensitive to the environment and place, it is a benchmark house for the manner in which the interior and exterior is integrated - a theme developed by followers throughout the 1960s. Simpson-Lee House I Wahroonga is highly regarded as an outstanding work of architecture by the architectural profession, a house which was aesthetically distinctive for its time and now exemplifies a style. Glenn Murcutt has written: 'Spatially, the house is an excellent example of a work holding to the principles of the \\"Modern Movement\\" in architecture and an exemplar of Arthur Baldwinson's architectural contribution to this country. The house sits so quietly and it is entirely unpretentious.' The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Does not meet this criteria. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Simpson-Lee House I Wahroonga is of State significance for its research value as a resource that demonstrates many features of modern architecture and design in theory and practice, and especially for its capacity to illuminate the work of Baldwinson. The house also has educational potential because it is held in such high esteem by the Australian architectural fraternity including eminent architects such as Glen Murcutt who has commented on Baldwinson's achievements. There is also research potential for studying the productive relationship between the architect and the clients. Glen Murcutt has suggested that the Simpson-Lees are amongst his most knowledgeable, architecturally fluent clients. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Does not meet this criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Simpson-Lee House I Wahroonga is of State significance as an excellent, intact mid twentieth century example of Australian modernist residential design, complete with interiors which reflect its clients' knowledge and interest in design. Simpson-Lee House I Wahroonga is an excellent, representative and intact example of the residential work of Arthur Baldwinson, one of the first generation of Australia's prominent modernist architects. It is a defining example of the outstanding design skills of a well regarded Australian architect and which clearly demonstrates his integration of the lessons of European modernism in an Australian setting.

After finishing fifth on her only appearance as a two- year-old she developed into a high-class performer in the following year when she won the Lancashire Oaks. She reached her peak as a four-year-old in 2007 when she defeated male opposition to take the Henry II Stakes, Goodwood Cup and Prix Royal-Oak. Although she was less successful in 2008 she added a final major victory in the Park Hill Stakes. Background Allegretto is a chestnut mare with a narrow white blaze bred in Ireland by the partnership of Kirsten Rausing and the Airlie Stud. In October 2004 the yearling filly was consigned to the Tattersalls sale and was bought for 415,000 guineas by the Cheveley Park Stud. She was sent into training with Michael Stoute at Newmarket, Suffolk. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo became a very successful breeding stallion and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland five times. His other progeny included Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found, Minding and Ruler of the World. Allegretto's dam Alleluia was a high-class staying mare who won the Doncaster Cup as a three-year-old in 2001. She was a daughter of Alruccaba (foaled 1983) whose other descendants have included Yesterday, Alborada, Quarter Moon, Aussie Rules (Poule d'Essai des Poulains) and Albanova (Preis von Europa). Racing career =2005: two-year-old season= Allegretto made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over one mile (eight furlongs) at Doncaster Racecourse on 21 October in which started at odds of 25/1 and finished fifth, beaten nine and a half lengths by In Dubai. =2006: three-year-old season= Allegretto began her second season in the Cheshire Oaks over one and a half miles at Chester Racecourse on 10 May and came home sixth of the twelve runners behind the John Dunlop-trained Time On. The filly was then dropped back in class for a maiden at Chepstow Racecourse on 16 June in which she was ridden by Kieren Fallon and recorded her first victory, coming home a length and a half in front of Nimra at odds of 30/100. She then stepped back up in class to contest the Group 2 Lancashire Oaks at Haydock Park on 8 July in which she was ridden by Ryan Moore and started the 13/2 third choice in the betting behind Princess Nada (Ballymacoll Stud Stakes) and Guilia (fifth in the Epsom Oaks). After tracking the leaders, Allegretto went to the front approaching the final furlong and won by three lengths from the 66/1 outsider Local Spirit. In the Group 1 Yorkshire Oaks over one and a half miles at York Racecourse in August Allegretto finished third of the six runners behind Alexandrova and Short Skirt. On her final appearance of the season the filly was moved up in distance and matched against older fillies and mares in the Park Hill Stakes which was run that year at York as Doncaster racecourse was closed for redevelopment. She was among the leaders from the start but was unable to make progress in the closing stages and finished third behind Rising Cross and Anna Pavlova. =2007: four-year-old season= In 2007, Allegretto competed in long-distance races, and faced male opposition on most occasions. After finishing fifth behind Sergeant Cecil in the Yorkshire Cup she contested the Henry II Stakes over two miles at Sandown Park on 29 May in which she was equipped with a visor for the first time. Ridden by Seb Sanders she started at odds of 12/1 in a seven-runner field which included Tungsten Strike (winner of the race in 2006), Mount Kilimanjaro (Further Flight Stakes) and Under The Rainbow (Zetland Stakes). After racing in third place she took the lead inside the final furlong and kept on \\"gamely\\" to win by three quarters of a length from Balkan Knight. In the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot on 21 June she started at odds of 14/1 and came home ninth of the fourteen runners behind Yeats who was winning the race for a second time. In the Goodwood Cup over two miles at Goodwood Racecourse on 2 August, the filly was ridden by Moore and started the 8/1 third-choice in the betting alongside Balkan Knight in a fifteen-runner field. Geordieland (runner-up in the Ascot Gold Cup) was the 6/4 favourite ahead of Distinction (winner of the race in 2005), while the others included Veracity (second in the Queen's Vase) and Tungsten Strike. After being restrained towards the rear she began to make steady progress when switched to the outside three furlongs from the finish. She overtook Veracity well inside the final furlong and won by half a length, with the front-running Finalmente three quarters of a length back in third. Ryan Moore commented \\"They went very fast and I always thought I would pick them off as they were coming back to us and she stays very well. I thought she had a bit to find with Geordieland and a few others beforehand, but this is her third Group Two win now\\". Allegretto was dropped back in distance in August for a second crack at the Yorkshire Oaks but was beaten into second place by the Irish three-year-old Peeping Fawn. In the following month she ran third behind Septimus and Geordieland in the Doncaster Cup. For her final run of the year the filly was sent to France to contest the Prix Royal Oak over 3100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 28 October. Ridden by Moore, she was made the 5.2/1 third choice behind Varevees (Prix Gladiateur) and Lord du Sud (Prix Kergorlay) in an eleven-runner field which also included Le Miracle (Prix du Cadran), Anna Pavlova (Prix de Royallieu), Macleya (Prix de Pomone) and Soapy Danger (Princess of Wales's Stakes). Alegretto raced towards the rear and turned into the straight in ninth place before making a sustained run on the outside. She gained the advantage 70 metres from the finish and took the prize by a short neck from Macleya with Ponte Tresa, Le Miracle, Brisant and Anna Pavlova close behind. After the race Moore said \\"We went a good pace, which was useful as she needs to stretch out and likes to pass horses. She idled a bit once she got her nose in front and has just done enough\\". =2008: five-year-old season= Allegretto began her fourth season by finishing last of the eight runners behind Finalmente in the Henry II Stakes and then came home a distant fourth behind Yeats in the Ascot Gold Cup. In her third attempt to win the Yorkshire Oaks (run that year at Newmarket) she finished fourth behind the three-year- olds Lush Lashes, Dar Re Mi and Michita. On 11 September the mare ran for the second time in the Park Hill Stakes and started the 7/4 favourite against seven opponents including Gravitation (Lillie Langtry Stakes), Gull Wing (Further Flight Stakes) and Under The Rainbow. After tracking the leaders, Allegretto took the lead approaching the last quarter mile any pulled clear to win \\"easily\\" by six lengths from the outsider Perihelion. On her final racecourse appearance she attempted to repeat her 2007 success in the Prix Royal-Oak and produced one of her best performances as she finished second of the eleven runners, beaten one and a half lengths by Yeats. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Allegretto was retired to become a broodmare for the Cheveley Park Stud. Her foals include: *Baihas, a bay colt (later gelded), foaled in 2010, sired by Nayef. Won one race. *Alla Breve, bay filly, 2012, by Dansili. Won one race. *Allegramente, bay filly, 2015, by Dansili *Jeweller, colt, 2016, by Mastercraftsman Pedigree *Allegretto was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree.

The emblem is identical to the emblem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.  History  The 11th Extraordinary Congress of the Soviets of Karelia on 16-17 June 1937 adopted the Constitution of the Karelian ASSR in 17 June 1937. The Chapter 10 of the Constitution contained the description of the symbols of the republic. The coat of arms of the Karelian ASSR was similar to the emblem of the Russian SFSR. The only difference is that the inscriptions were in Russian, Karelian, and Finnish. = First revision = At a meeting of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Karelian ASSR on 29 December 1937, it was decided to remove the Finnish language inscription in the emblem. This happened due to the reprisals against the Finns in the Karelian ASSR on the second half of 1937. = Promotion to SSR and re-demotion to ASSR= On 8 July 1940, the Karelian ASSR was re-organized as the Karelo-Finnish SSR. The SSR was given a new emblem. On 16 July 1956, the Karelo-Finnish SSR was demoted into the Karelian ASSR. = Second revision = The coat of arms of the Karelian ASSR was described in the Article 111 of the Constitution of 1956, which was adopted on 20 August 1956, at the 4th session of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelian ASSR. The emblem was similar with the emblem of the Russian SFSR, but was supplemented with the motto in Finnish : Kaikkien maiden proletaarit, liittyk√§√§ yhteen! The Finnish language was restored as the official language as the Karelian ASSR, replacing the Karelian language. = Third revision = The 1978 Constitution of the Karelian ASSR confirmed the emblem and the flag of the republic on the article 157 and 158. Some changes were made to the inscriptions, with the name of the Karelian ASSR in Finnish was added. Regulations on the emblem were adopted by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelian ASSR in 1981.

The B-side was \\"Teacher\\", an alternate version of which later appeared on the US release of the album Benefit. In the United States the single was released on the Reprise label. Background The song was recorded at Morgan Studios, London on 19 December 1969. It was intended to be a follow-up to the group's two previous singles, \\"Living in the Past\\" and \\"Sweet Dream\\", which had been top ten hits. Musically, it developed from the style heard on the group's previous album, Stand Up, discarding the blues influences that the band had started with, and steered towards folk. The single was the first recording to feature keyboardist John Evan, who would be a key member of Jethro Tull throughout the 1970s. He was sharing a flat with frontman Ian Anderson at the time, and agreed to perform as a session musician. This led to an offer to join the band full-time. The track is one of the few recorded by Jethro Tull to feature the Mellotron, a tape replay keyboard that could emulate a string section, and the only single released by the band to feature the instrument. \\"The Witch's Promise\\" was intended to be the last standalone single from the group, that was not taken from an LP.

It was designed by Walter Burley Griffin and built from 1935 to 1936. It is also known as Coppins and Crompton. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.  History  Robert Pymble, a settler and orchardist, was granted by the Crown in the parish (as later defined) of Gordon in 1823. Unlike many grantees of his time, Pymble became a permanent resident and pioneer of the region. He retained most of his estate for most of his life. It was not until 1882, when the district was beginning to expand to accommodate upper class dwellers from the city, that large-scale alienation of the Pymble properties took place. The projected building of the North Shore railway (begun in 1887 and opened from St Leonards to Hornsby in 1890) was a powerful incentive for development. In 1883, Pymble sold two large blocks, totalling , on Lane Cove Road and on the junction of a government road (later Telegraph Road). The subject block of on Telegraph Road was sold to a medical doctor, Dr Walter O'Reilly, in 1883. O'Reilly and his wife and family heirs retained the land, building on a portion of it, until they began to dispose of it in the 1920s. In 1922 O'Reilly's widow and sons sold the Graham Avenue portion to James Kebblewhite, merchant. Kebblewhite's widow and son sold it to Eric Herbert Pratten in 1934. The adjacent portion (in respect of its south section) was acquired by Pratten in 1939. Eric Pratten's father, Frederick was a printer, engineer and politician who had settled in Telegraph Road.Cable in Tropman & Tropman, 2002, 3 Herbert Pratten and his half brother Frederick had migrated from England to Australia and started Pratten Brothers Printing. They were a successful firm, and were also involved in mining and manufacturing. Herbert Pratten became a leading national politician. He built a large house for his family in Telegraph Road. After Frederick's two sons, Eric and David had married in the early 1930s, their father gave them land in Telegraph Road and funds to build a house to their own design. It is believed that the two brothers were inspired after seeing Cameron House in Marion Street, Killara, designed by Walter Burley Griffin (completed in 1933). Both Eric and David Pratten commissioned Griffin to design their houses. In 1935, before the second (and final) set of plans for Eric's house were completed, Griffin left Australia for India where, after an extraordinary burst of creativity, he died in 1937. Eric's house, known as Coppins, was finished and construction supervised by Griffin's partner and former assistant, Eric Nicholls. Although a disciple of Griffin and a sharer of his Anthroposophical beliefs, Nicholls was obliged to modify some of Griffin's symbolism for the client. It seems to be accepted opinion that the result is similar to work that Griffin had done in Frank Lloyd Wright's studio in Chicago, reminiscent of the Prairie School (of architecture). The David Pratten house at the corner of Telegraph Road and Mona Vale Road, opposite his uncle Herbert's family house, was the third Griffin design for the site. The first two schemes were single storey flat roofed residences with stone rubble walls featuring typical Griffin design elements such as projecting panels of stonework over the window openings. The client eventually approved a more conventional design with a low-pitched hip and gable ended roof form. Nicholls also supervised the construction of this house after Griffin's departure for India. The David Pratten house features a circular lounge which projects as a single storey bay from the rectangular plan. The curved bay of the lounge is reflected in the semi circular terrace, which extends the house into the garden. Unfortunately this house has since been remodelled with loss of much of the original Griffin decorative treatment. Authorities are divided on the place of these last houses designed by Griffin in Australia. To Peter Harrison (1995), they \\"did not afford Griffin much satisfaction...far removed from the domestic retreats in which he delighted.\\" A more sympathetic estimate is in the Powerhouse Museum volume: 'although designed at the highpoint of Griffin's Steiner phase and incorporating some Steiner motifs, [the Eric Pratten House] is in fact a reprise of the central design problem of the Griffins' Chicago years: how to create a radical house for a conservative client.'.Weirick, 1998, p82 =Landscape= The gardens of the estate include several formal and informal garden elements that result from a landscape concept for the estate. There is a deliberate and considered relationship between these elements and the design of the main house. The layout of the large garden elements are arranged in response to the house's planning and fenestration. These elements, e.g.: the swimming pool terrace, the rose garden and the sunken courtyard, are aligned along significant axes with the house. The development and construction of the estate was progressive, with the final large elements, i.e.: the swimming pool, being constructed approximately 15 years after completion of the house. Following an interview with the original owners, it has since been learnt that the initial garden was done in collaboration with a designer named Campbell from New Zealand. It appears that the garden design and spatial arrangement was worked out with the construction of the house. The later larger elements were designed by John Suttor of Suttor & Cox. It is very possible that Suttor used design details from Griffin's work on the house, stone wall and entry gate to tie in these later garden elements to the house and the original garden features. The design of the house is evidence that the initial siting of the house and the planned outlook of the rooms, were designed by Griffin to take command of the site, as well as to focus on the house as the principal feature of the landscape. The house was deliberately located with its back to the west, on a knoll at the corner where the two original lots met. This was the only position allowing the house and the rooms within to interact with all areas of the site, while taking advantage of the views. The location of the house was also likely to have considered the future uses of the various areas of the garden, and catered to the formal/public and private needs of the various users.Tropman & Tropman, 2002, 7 The place conveys the stylistic cohesiveness notable in Griffin's work, and is particularly significant as the house stands within large formal grounds with a sunken garden, tennis court and pool - even the dog kennel was designed by Griffin. Many mature trees, most considered to be part of the original planting layout, have survived. Griffin scholars believe that the complexity of the garden layout suggests that Marion Mahony, Griffin's wife, may have been responsible for its design.Nicholas, 2001, 5 The house was sold after Eric Pratten died in the mid 1960sand was purchased by the Denning family who occupied it until 2000. During that time little fundamental change was made to the house although some of the bathrooms and the kitchen were up-dated. The gardens were also amended somewhat without changing the main features of the house and its relationship to the garden. In December 2000 the property was subdivided and placed on the State Heritage Register. It was subsequently sold in 2001 to property developer Michael Kwok. In 2010 Kwok tried to sell it for over $8.5m. In June 2012 the estate was listed for sale by HSBC Bank after Kwok's bankruptcy. Among his failed Australian business ventures was the Fairmont Resort at Leura. In February 2013 one of the two blocks in this estate ( with the house and pool) sold. The other \\"garden\\" block (, with tennis court, outbuildings and rear drive) remains on the real estate market.SMH, 22-23/2/2013  Description  The house is set within a large corner site of on two titles. The Telegraph Road section of the site is fairly level, but Graham Avenue falls about from Telegraph Road. The house is sited near the western boundary on the highest part of the site. It is approached via a long gravel drive. The drive terminates at the stone and tile garage, which has similar detail to the main house. There is a secondary pedestrian entrance from Telegraph Road along a path behind the house to the kitchen and garage. The south-eastern part of the site drops off and a large pool is located there. It is not visually obvious from the house or the entrance. To the west of the pool and behind the garage is a private courtyard area defined by stone walls and largely screened from view due to the fall of the site. The site contains many large mature trees, believed to be part of Griffin's original planting layout. The site is located behind a high stone wall, which is covered by a vine. The house is almost totally obscured from view due to the number of large mature trees on the site and also on the footpath along Telegraph Road. The design elements of the house demonstrate some of Steiner's ideas about spirituality and the concepts of anthroposophy. The house is formed from carefully articulated sandstone masses with battered walls, angular prows and deep reveals set beneath a series of sailing roofs in a re-interpretation of the Wrightian Prairie house. The ground floor window reveals, cut into the stone batters, have lintels dressed in a low triangular motif. The effect is somewhat Tudor Gothic, but is also reminiscent of the trapezoidal windows, which characterize Steiner's work. The Eric Pratten house is designed at the high point of Griffin's Steiner phase incorporating some of Steiner's motifs. =Landscape= The gardens of the estate include several formal and informal garden elements that result from a landscape concept for the estate.

The swimming pool terrace and tennis court feature extensive sandstone battered walling and there is a pump room and boiler next to the sandstone retaining wall below the swimming pool next to the semi-circular apse; * a productive garden including a glass house, various sheds, vegetable/fruit beds and composting pits south of the garage; * various structures south of the garage - i.e.: the dog kennel and run, various aviaries, a timber bird house and various garden sheds; * a service entry corridor from Telegraph Rd. located along the western boundary on the western side of the house, leading to the rear kitchen entry to the house; * windmill and a header water tank on a tall stand west of the garage and house; * a gardener's lodge located next (west) to the tennis court; * a grazing paddock with tall forest trees, to the west of the tennis court and gardener's lodge; * remnants of a rear driveway, i.e.: sandstone edging and split-face pavers from the garage to the south-west corner of the site; * various sandstone retaining walls; * sandstone boundary walls, set with wrought iron pedestrian gates, and topped with wrought iron fences.Tropman & Tropman, 2002, 5 = Condition = As at 28 August 2006, no known archaeological potential.

The gardens were also amended somewhat *2002: unapproved works undertaken:  a new (non) boundary fence built (potentially a new boundary fence);  new plants planted and established (altering current boundary structures);  new watering system installed; and  five bathrooms gutted. = Further information = Nominated by Ku-ring-gai Council with support of Walter Burley Griffin Society.  Heritage listing  As at 9 January 2008, the Eric Pratten house is important as Griffin's largest domestic commission in Australia. It was one of his last works before leaving Australia for India and completed by his associate, Nicholls. It is one of three large Griffin houses in Ku-ring-gai. The Eric Pratten house is important as a large Griffin designed residence, which includes the house within its garden setting. It is rare, as the majority of his residential commissions in Australia are relatively small houses, typically one storey. The house demonstrates a high level of technical competence and excellence, particularly related to stone construction in Australia during the 1930s. Eric Pratten House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Eric Pratten house is important as Griffin's largest domestic commission in Australia. It was one of his last works before leaving Australia for India and completed by his associate, Nicholls. It is one of three large Griffin houses in Ku-ring- gai. Griffin is one of the most influential architects to work in Australia, coming here after his winning design for Canberra. Griffin had a very prolific career in Australia, designing a wide range of buildings from small shelters, houses, utilitarian buildings such as incinerators, major buildings such as Newman College, whole suburbs and towns. A noted characteristic of his work is a close connection with the Australian landscape. His later work is influenced strongly by Steiner's philosophies and the belief in anthrosophy. Donald Lesley Johnson, in his book \\"The Architecture of Walter Burley Griffin\\", holds the view that this house is a disappointment because it seems antithetical to the philosophies of architecture, landscape design and planning Griffin formulated and practised during his stay in Australia. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Eric Pratten house is important as a large Griffin designed residence, which includes the house within its garden setting.

The house, formed from carefully articulated sandstone masses with battered walls, angular prows and deep reveals set beneath a series of sailing roofs in a re-interpretation of the Wrightian Prairie house. The design elements of the house demonstrate Griffin's ideas about spirituality influenced by Steiner and the concepts of anthroposophy. The Eric Pratten house is designed at the high point of Griffin's Steiner phase. The house demonstrates a high level of technical competence and excellence, particularly related to stone construction in Australia during the 1930s.

This species produces airborne spores and is an endophyte of several plant species in North America, South America and in the Middle East.  History of taxonomy  Photomicrograph of Tritirachium oryzae in Nomarski Differential Interference Contrast microscopy Original illustration of Tritirachium oryzae (as Beauveria oryzae) by M.-F. Vincens Tritirachium oryzae was first described as Beauveria oryzae by Vincens in 1923 in a study of fungi on rice in the French Vietnamese colony of Cochinchina. The species epithet, \\"oryzae\\" derives from the Latin, orza, meaning rice. In 1940, Limber created the genus Tritirachium based on the zig- zag nature of the conidiom bearing cells that resembled the flowering rachis ofTriticum. Saccas independently rediscovered the fungus and named it Beauveria heimii in 1948. In 1972, de Hoog re-evaluated these fungi and confirmed the correct name to be Tritirachium oryzae. The fungus is a member of the phylum, Basidiomycota, distantly related to the rust fungi.  Morphology  Tritirachium oryzae is an asexual fungus that grows well at 25-28 ¬∞C aerobically. It develops distinctly purple colonies with a velvet- like surface and pale to dark reddish-brown reverse coloration. Colonies consist of pale to brown smooth thin-walled hyphae. Conidia-bearing hyphae branch off and taper to form long and flat thick-walled arms, which have a characteristic zig-zag form. Conidia are 2.5 x 2.1 Œºm with a glassy-like appearance and are formed in spirals on conidiogenous cells The microorganism resembling wheat flowering heads. Conidia readily break free of the bearing cells and become airborne. Identification can be readily established using either morphological or molecular genetic methods.  Ecology  Tritirachium oryzae is commonly found on soil and decaying plant material and has been reported on maize and other crops. The fungus has been isolated from paper, vegetable fibres, textiles and adhesives, and is infrequently found in insulation materials, wood and ceiling tiles. This fungus has been reported globally in Iran, Pakistan, India, Brazil, and the United States.  Pathogenicity  Tritirachium oryzae can either act as a symbiont such as in is in Himalayan blue pine and other plants, or as an opportunistic pathogen of insects and humans. Human infection has been recorded multiple times under nails, in the cornea, and in the scalp, but produces little pathological substances harmful to humans. These infections are readily treated by azole topical drugs such as ketoconazole, itraconazole and posaconazole. The fungus is potentially active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and is active against the plant pathogen Ceratocystis fimbriata and Staphylococcus aureus.

Ball, the chief designer of C&C; Design and first built in 1979. The Landfall series, begun with the Landfall 42, was part of a trend within C&C; Yachts to develop more cruising-oriented designs under company president George Cuthbertson's direction during the later 1970s and early 1980s. The Landfall 38 is a development of the C&C; 38-2 and used the same hull molds for construction, but was built with shallower keel and shorter rig, plus a totally different interior. Production The design was built by the Canadian company, C&C; Yachts, at their Rhode Island, United States plant between 1979 and 1985, but it is now out of production. A total of 185 examples were completed. Design The Landfall 38 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with a balsawood cored deck and hull and with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a raked stem, a raised and almost vertical transom, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar 3HM or 3QM diesel engine of . The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The design has a hull speed of . Operational history John Kretschmer, writing in Sailing Magazine in 2008 said of the design: \\"The prime reason why the C&C; Landfall 38 is a desirable used boat is because of the way it sails. It points high and tracks well. It has a soft motion in a seaway and accelerates nicely off the wind. The rudder is located well aft, providing good steering control while reaching. Most sail controls are within arm's reach of the helm, making the boat user-friendly. It's nimble enough under power and can be conned into tight slips without too much fuss. Many years ago I delivered a Landfall 38 south from New England to Fort Lauderdale. We encountered a pretty serious blow off Cape Lookout. We were reduced to forereaching with a deeply furled headsail and double reefed main. I was impressed how well the Landfall handled the steep seas. We didn't pound and we didn't miss a meal. My only complaint was that when the gale blew through we were becalmed and had to resort to motoring, which is definitely not the Landfall's best \\"point of sail.\\" ... If I was looking for a boat for a yearlong Caribbean sabbatical and had less than $70,000 to spend, I'd put the C&C; Landfall 38 at the top of my list. It is well built, cleverly designed both on deck and below, and sails nicely. It is also handsome. And it also has a great name.\\" Practical Sailor magazine describes the design, \\"The Landfall 38 is stiff and well-balanced under sail. Owners report that she is as fast or faster than similar boats of the same size. The Landfall 38‚Äôs PHRF rating, for example, is 120, squarely between the 114 of the Cal 39 and the 126 of the Tartan 37‚Äî two boats to which the Landfall 38 will inevitably be compared in size, type, and price ... To our way of thinking, performance cruising is what it‚Äôs all about. It‚Äôs all well and good to have a heavy, underrigged boat if you‚Äôre cruising around the world. Most people‚Äôs cruising, however, is limited to a few weeks a year, with moderate distances between ports, and schedules that have to be met. A boat that will get you there fast, safely, and in comfort is a highly desirable type of boat for this kind of cruising. From a performance viewpoint, the Landfall 38 meets those requirements.\\" ... \\"General design and construction are excellent. The hull is a proven design, the rig is efficient and strong. There are a number of design details that should be improved for serious cruising, notably the companionway, cockpit protection, life raft storage, and provision for shorthanded handling under sail ... A serious cruising boat must function as well bashing to windward for days on end as it does at the dock. Above all, it must keep its crew dry and comfortable. We have yet to find the perfect cruising boat, but many of the things we‚Äôd look for are found in the Landfall 38. We wish they were all there, but the fact that they aren‚Äôt is what keeps designers and builders in business.\\" See also * List of sailing boat types Related development *C&C; 38-2 Similar sailboats *Alajuela 38 *C&C; 38 *Catalina 38 *Catalina 375 *Columbia 38 *Eagle 38 *Farr 38 *Hunter 38 *Hunter 380 *Hunter 386 *Sabre 38 *Shannon 38 *Yankee 38 References External links * Original Factory Brochure - C&C; Landfall 38 * Original Factory Brochure - C&C; Landfall 38 * Original Factory Brochure - C&C; Landfall 38 with Sail Plan and Accommodations Layouts Category:Keelboats Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Landfall 38"},{"id":"58542739","text":"Carl Strommen (born May 7, 1939) is an American composer, music pedagogue and conductor.

It was built in 1870. It is also known as Gordon Post Office. The property is owned by the Uniting Church in Australia and is within the perimeter fence of the Ravenswood School for Girls. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1860 residents of Lane Cove, (present Gordon area), petitioned the Postal Department successfully for a local post office, Previously letters, papers etc. were carried from Sydney and later from St. Leonards, by residents travelling along the road. The dwelling chosen was the cottage of Mrs Eliza Edwards (granddaughter of Robert Pymble). The Edwards family has strong associations with the development of the North Shore. The grandfather, Robert Pymble was a pioneer of the North Shore and recipient of a grant of in 1823 in the area known as Pymble. He supplied timber to Sydney and was the pioneer orchardist of the area. he was instrumental in having the railway constructed to Old Hornsby (Pearce's Corner) and particularly in having a rail station established at what came to be called Killara. The name Killara was Edwards' choice. Miss Eliza (who preferred Elizabeth) Edwards was appointed Post Mistress, with a salary A‚Ç§12 per year. Her sureties were neighbours Robert and George MacIntosh, orchardists. The post office business was conducted in a bedroom at the rear of the cottage. The mail came once a week, later on, twice, the mail carrier was first Michael Fagan, later Foley and Porter names were given. It was customary to leave Sydney at 7am and deliver mail at Gordon, camp there and the next day continue with the mail to Hornsby and Gosford, first by road and after 1890 by train. In 1879 the name of the Post Office name was changed to Gordon Post Office. Miss Edwards report in the 1880s says 'from Chatswood to Pearce's Corner (Wahroonga) people rode or walked or sent for their mail.\\" In 1885 two brick rooms were added to the front of the original cottage and most probably the existing verandah structure giving the cottage its present appearance. On 10 January 1890 Miss Edwards advised the General Post Office that she considered the best way to serve the interests of Upper Gordon would be to establish a \\"receiving office\\" at Mr Filley's store on the corner of Gordon and Irish Town Roads. Later a bag could be made up at Sydney or St. Leonards and left Pymble platform. In 1887 as the construction of the railway from St. Leonards to Pearce's Corner, Miss Edwards made an application to the General Post Office to include the sale of money orders in view of changes to come with the population increase, since they were situated near the approved site of Gordon Station. In 1894 Miss Edwards' resigned because of ill-health. In the same year the Post Office was moved to the Gordon railway station. Miss Edwards continued to live in the dwelling with her children until her death in 1902. The cottage continued to be occupied by Miss Edwards family until 1952. Ravenswood School for Girls purchased the property between 1952 and 1955. In 1980 proposals to demolish the cottage for tennis courts were considered. On 11 July 1980 an Interim Conservation Order was placed over the property. On 2 April 1999 it was transferred to the State Heritage Register.  Description  Modest single story brick building with iron roof. Verandah at front and simple chamfered wood posts.  Heritage listing  As at 9 August 2013, the cottage is one of the earliest dwellings in the district. As a post office from 1860 to 1894 it played an important part in the everyday lives of early settlers of the North Shore. The use of the cottage as a post office between 1860 and 1894 allocates its place in the historical geography of New South Wales.

It is a Grade I listed building. Originally a late 16th-century half-H house built by John Clerk it was substantially rebuilt in the 17th century by George William Brydges, who added the service courtyard and banqueting hall. It was then refronted in the late 18th century by James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos. In 1848 Sir John Shelley added a conservatory. The building is now constructed of brick and blue with slate and lead roofs. The half-H main block is in two storeys with a 13-bay frontage, of which the central 5 bays are recessed. History Avington Park was granted to Edmund Clerk by Henry VIII. It was bought in 1664 by George Rodney Brydges, who married the infamous Anna Maria Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury and was a Groom of the Bedchamber to Charles II. It passed to his son George William Brydges who carried out the major remodelling. He had no children and left most of his estate to Henry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos, after which it descended to his son, the courtier James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos, who improved the gardens and parkland. The estate then descended to the 3rd Duke's only surviving daughter, Lady Anne Elizabeth Brydges, who married Richard Temple-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos and in turn to their son Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges- Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, the Lord Privy Seal. He sold it in 1847 to Sir John Shelley, the younger brother of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. In 1961 it was bought by Lt. Col and Mrs Hickson and put in trust for their family. Although privately owned, the house, grounds and tea bar are open to the public on selected days during the summer. It is also available for wedding ceremonies, private and corporate parties, meetings, conferences and private group tours.

Its mission is to help young people become avid and skilled readers, writers, and inquirers through research, curriculum development, and in-school professional development. TCRWP develops methods and tools for the teaching of reading and writing through research, curriculum development published through Heinemann, and professional development with teachers and school leaders. TCRWP supports the Reading Workshop and Writers Workshop approaches through its Units of Study curriculum. The project involves thousands of schools and teachers in New York and around the country in an ongoing, multi-faceted in-service community of practitioners engaged in the application and continual refinement of approaches to helping children become effective writers and readers.  Curriculum and research  TCRWP was founded by Lucy Calkins in 1981. Prior to founding the Project, Calkins was a researcher working with Donald Graves on the first research study on writing funded by the National Institute of Education. After founding the Project, Calkins developed methodologies designed to increase the amount of writing in classrooms, such as the use of texts as models for writing. In its early years, the work of the Project was focused primarily on supporting writing instruction, later this focus widened to include reading and support for all components of balanced literacy. By 2013, the Project had affiliations with over 600 schools and an extensive involvement in New York City's education system, working with hundreds of districts and whole cities such as Chicago, Albany, and Seattle, as well as internationally in Israel, Sweden, Jordan, and others. Curriculum developed by Project staff supports a balanced literacy approach to reading and writing instruction that is in wide use across the United States. Calkins and TCRWP have tailored the approach to the Common Core Standards by increasing the amount of nonfiction, including more discussion of difficult texts and decreasing the amount of time devoted to personal writing. The \\"Writer's Workshop\\" model is based on the idea that children are natural writers. According to the New York Times, TCRWP and Lucy Calkins have been \\"architects\\" of New York City's balanced literacy program in schools. New York Magazine referred to Calkins as \\"looked upon nationally as a godmother of whole- language learning.\\" Balanced Literacy took off under Mayor Michael Bloomberg who mandated the approach in 2003, and turned to Lucy Calkins as an early advocate of the approach, which factored into the \\"Reading Wars\\" nationally in the debate between phonics vs. whole-language instruction. The Units of Study have been adopted and implemented by some of the lowest-performing schools in the city, \\"Renewal Schools,\\" through an initiative by Chancellor Carmen Farina to help schools meet Common Core standards. In New York City schools that work closely with TCRWP, 20% more students performed at or above standards on the state's English Language Arts test in 2016. At least 10,000 New York City teachers have attended Project workshops and TCRWP holds millions of dollars in city contracts. The TCRWP has published Units of Study in Writing for Grades K-8, Units of Study in Reading for Grades K-8, and Units of Study in Phonics for Grades K-1. The Units of Study curriculum guide books and \\"workshop\\" model centers on independent student work in combination with teacher modeling and one-on-one and small-group guidance. The Project has also published a Classroom Library Series through Heinemann, which includes books for grades K-8 from more than 50 different publishers. These books are designed for students who read both on grade level and below, and each library contains between 450 and 700 titles spanning from fiction and nonfiction genres such as classics, sports, science, mystery, fantasy, biography, and history, and features a strong social justice component. The Project also jointly operates Reading Rescue, a literacy intervention program, in hundreds of school in New York City.  Professional development  The Project creates learning progressions for students through curricular calendars provided to schools and works weekly with principals, literacy coaches, and teachers to bring the curriculum to life. TCRWP also provides training at Teachers College, Columbia University year-round including multi-day training institutes and one-day workshops for teachers and school leaders. TCRWP works in thousands of classrooms and schools around the world. More than 170,000 teachers have attended the Project's week-long institutes, and over 4,000 participants return each year for Saturday Reunions. Over 4,000 teachers attend summer institutes and TCRWP works during the year with about a third of the city's 80,000 teachers.

He was best known for his extensive photo documentation of the everyday life of Jewish immigrants in the 1930s. The only photographs of Israel's declaration of independence by David Ben Gurion in 1948 are by Weissenstein, who built a collection of over a million negatives. Biography Rudi Weissenstein was born in 1910 in the Bohemian-Moravian town of Jihlava and grew up as one of four children. From 1929 to 1931 he completed an apprenticeship as a book printer at the Graphische Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt in Vienna. He then completed his military service in the Czechoslovak army and then worked as a photographer at the Prague and Vienna newspapers. Since 1934 Weissenstein planned his emigration to Palestine and he left Europe in the late 1935, reaching Haifa in January 1936. He continued to work as a photographer and journalist and in 1940 married Miriam Arnstein (1913-2011), who had studied dance and acrobatics in Vienna and had emigrated to Palestine before Weissenstein. Together they opened Photo House Pri-Or in Tel Aviv on Allenby street in 1940. Weissenstein documented the Jewish everyday and cultural life in Tel Aviv, including numerous prominent personalities - artists and politicians, such as Marc Chagall, Max Brod, Eleanor Roosevelt, Isaac Stern and the painter Nahum Gutman. He photographed for the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra since the first concert conducted by Arturo Toscanini. Weissenstein's most well-known photograph is that of the Declaration of Independence of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948, by David Ben Gurion, where he was the only accredited photographer. Legacy Rudi Weissenstein died in 1992 and his estate - a photo archive of more than 250,000 negatives was managed and maintained by his widow until her death in 2011. Since 2011, the archive and Photo House is managed by his grandson Ben Peter Weissenstein in a new store on Tshernichovski Street, received from the Tel Aviv municipality. Miriam Weissenstein and Ben Peter Weissenstein were part of the documentary film \\"Life In Stills\\" by Tamar Tal, dealing among other things with the history of the photo house, which Rudi Weissenstein had opened. =Exhibitions= Weissenstein's photographs have been shown and awarded numerous prizes in Israel and abroad, among others in 1961 with the award at the International Photography Exhibition in Moscow for the recording \\"Working Hands\\". His works were exhibited in Heussenstamm Gallery in Frankfurt, Germany; Eckhart Gallery, The Hague; The Jewish Museum in Munich, Germany. The last exhibition in Germany \\"Your happy eyes\\" in 2010 was opened by Miriam Weissenstein. Bibliography * Dvir Ori: Rudi Weissenstein. Israel Early Photographs.

Built in 1866, it is a distinctive local example of Italianate architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. It is now home to the American Silver Museum, which is generally open by appointment or on special occasions. Description and history The Franklin Johnson House is located in a residential area south of Wallingford's central business district on the west side of South Main Street south of Prince Street. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of brick that has been finished with stucco-like concrete scored to resemble stone. It is covered by a low-pitch hip roof, at whose center is a square cupola. The roof eaves are decorated with large carved brackets, and the cupola, a reproduction of the building's original one (lost in the New England hurricane of 1938) also exhibits Italianate features. The main facade is three bays wide, and its first floor is sheltered by a porch with tapered and fluted round columns separated by iron balustrades. Windows are set in rectangular openings that have pink granite lintels and sills. To the rear of the property there is a multi-seat outhouse, built with stylistically similar materials. With The house was built in 1866 for Franklin Johnson, a local man active in real estate. It remained in residential use until about 1980, at which time it was converted to professional office use. It has since been adapted to house the American Silver Museum. The house is a distinctive example of Italianate architecture, in the style promoted by New Haven architect Henry Austin; its designer is unknown.

Robinson (1910‚Äì88), first published in 1967. The story follows Anna, a young girl who temporarily moves to Norfolk to heal after becoming ill. There she meets a mysterious girl named Marnie who lives in a house overlooking the marshes. In 2014, it was adapted by Studio Ghibli as an animated film of the same name. Background The book was inspired by a house in Burnham Overy and the character of Anna was based on Robinson's own experiences as a child. Plot summary The novel follows an adopted girl named Anna. Her foster mother, Mrs Preston, anxiously bids farewell as Anna boards a train to Norfolk; she had been invited by an old couple, Mrs Pegg and Sam, to stay at their home after learning she is ill. During her journey, she apathetically reflects on her loneliness, and Mrs Preston's overwhelming concern for her. She arrives, later walking to the nearby staithe that opens into a creek inset a marsh. There, she observes an old house across the water‚Äîthe Marsh House. Over the days she spends time outdoors, finding quiet company with a local fisherman, Wuntermenny. She visits the Post Office where a local girl, Sandra, mocks her, viewing Anna as socially inept. Anna angrily runs off, upset. Anna secretly leaves the house that night, finds a boat, and rows towards the Marsh House where outside she encounters a blonde haired girl, Marnie. Anna explains she is a visitor to the area, and Marnie explains she lives in the Marsh House. The two agree to keep their meeting secret and they meet again next evening, asking more questions. The next day Mrs Pegg scolds Anna, having learned that she'd quarrelled with Sandra. Feeling disturbed, Anna spends the daytime alone outdoors. That night, Anna rows to the Marsh House. Marnie finds Anna, disguising her as a beggar girl and bringing her indoors to a lavish party, enchanting Anna. Thereafter, they meet regularly: Marnie explains her parents are regularly absent, and that she's supervised by two maids. Anna explains she is adopted, tearfully confiding that her foster parents are paid a care allowance, doubting she's sincerely loved. Marnie consoles her, promising she will love her forever. Marnie admits her maids abuse her, and threaten to lock her in the nearby, dilapidated windmill, and that she has an older cousin, Edward, who she alternately spends time with. Although Marnie had reassured Anna she loves her the most, Anna privately becomes intimidated by knowledge of Edward. Anna visits the windmill alone, believing she can later reassure Marnie that it's not frightening, a gesture Edward could not offer. Inside she finds Marnie in extreme terror and is unable to calm her. Anna falls asleep and wakes up to find Marnie is gone. Heartbroken, she runs out and collapses. Anna spends days bedridden, angered that Marnie had left her. Anna goes out to shun Marnie, who apologises to Anna and says she cannot see her any more. Anna forgives her, and then collapses in the marsh. Wuntermenny rescues her, and she returns to being bedridden. After recovering, Anna realises her memories of Marnie are no longer lucid. Thereafter she begins to actively socialise, interacting with locals. She meets a family, The Lindsays, who are moving into the Marsh House, and becomes acquainted with a girl, Scilla. Scilla explains she found a diary at the Marsh House. They read the diary, which details Marnie's daily life. Scilla's mother, Mrs Lindsay, interprets the archaic language and events, estimating the diary dates to The Great War. The diary is shown to a family friend of The Lindsays, Gillie, who narrates the diary to Anna and The Lindsays: Gillie reveals Marnie, a childhood friend of hers, grew up to marry Edward and have a daughter, Esm√©. Edward died and Esm√© was sent to boarding school, becoming estranged from Marnie. Esm√© eloped and had a daughter named Marianna, before dying in a car crash. Marianna briefly came into the care of Marnie, who died several years ago. Marianna was then adopted; it is revealed Anna, renamed from Marianna, was Marnie's granddaughter. Anna finds closure in this story, and spends the next days with The Lindsays. Before going home, Anna goes outside to say goodbye to Wuntermenny, and then turns to the mansion to see Marnie at the window waving goodbye to her. Adaptations In 1971, BBC One London adapted the novel to television for the children's book reading programme Jackanory. The book was read by Ann Bell, with filming and photography staged in Burnham Overy. It ran as five episodes, each 15 minutes, from November 8 to 12. In 2006, BBC Radio 4 adapted the novel as a radio play for an episode of The Saturday Play. It was dramatised by Beaty Rubens and directed by David Hunter, and included voices of Georgina Hagen (Anna) and Juliet Aaltonen (Marnie). In 2014, Studio Ghibli released an animated adaption of the book, with the story set in Hokkaido. The anime was directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi. Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki had previously recommended the book. The anime won the Chicago International Children's Film Festival, and an Oscar nomination in 2015.

Life and career Garbutt was born in 1925 in Middlesbrough. During the Second World War, he served as a naval gunner; as a crew member of a rescue ship at the Dunkirk evacuation, he himself had to be rescued when his ship sank. After the war he played football for South Bank East End and was on Middlesbrough's books as an amateur before his single appearance for Whitby Townhe scored four goals in a Northern League match against Shildon in September 1947earned him a professional contract with Manchester City. He was unable to break through to City's first team, and at the end of the season joined Spennymoor United of the North Eastern League. He signed for Watford of the Third Division South in 1950, and made his Football League debut on 30 August in a 1‚Äì0 defeat away to Reading. In ten months with the club, he scored 8 goals from 23 appearances before being swapped for Brighton & Hove Albion's centre forward Cyril Thompson. He scored 17 goals in 20 months for Brighton, at better than a goal every two games, but never established himself as a regular in the side, and moved on to Workington in November 1952. He fell out with the club over money, and left at the end of the season having played only eight times; Workington retained his registration for several years.

The group follows the ideology of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky.  Formation  The seeds of the Marxist politics was planted in 1980 in Netherlands, when a number of leftist Pakistani activists who had fled Pakistan to escape Zia‚Äôs repression found themselves in Amsterdam in the cold November 1980. The country was ruled by the notorious General Zia. These leftist Pakistani activists were Farooq Tariq, Tanvir Gondal (now better known as Lal Khan), Muhammed Amjad and Ayub Gorya who Brainstormed ideas and strategies to oppose Zia while in exile and came up with the concept for a progressive organisation they dubbed the Struggle Group which would keep the flame of protest alive, even in exile. In November 1980, the Struggle group decided to start a monthly Urdu magazine called Jidd-o-jehed or The Struggle€î The Struggle magazine soon developed a cult status among the Pakistani diaspora, and poets like Habib Jalib, Ahmad Faraz and Faiz Ahmed Faiz started contributing to the magazine by writing revolutionary and anti-dictatorship Urdu poems for the magazine. In December 1984, the magazine published a poem Main Baaghi Hoon, written by Khalid Javaid Jan. The poem became a staple in popular culture due to its revolutionary tone and was used in underground protests as a weapon against Dictator Zia. The Struggle group continued their activism in exile against military dictatorship in Pakistan and went on to organise a mass funeral for Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in front of the Pakistani embassy in Holland with nearly 500 participants. The charged environment also saw participants throw stones at the embassy‚Äôs windows and Farooq was briefly arrested by Dutch police. Arrests, activism and attempts by Pakistani authorities to get them arrested made them popular with leftist and progressive movements in Europe. They campaigned on worker issues, against racism, immigrant issues and anti-nuclearisation with local left parties. The group was also in contact with the Committee for a Workers International (CWI), a Trotskyist ‚Äúinternational.‚Äù = Pakistan base = In 1986, the Struggle group started working from Pakistani soil when Farooq Tariq and Lal Khan returned to Pakistan. The Struggle followed a strategy known as Entryism, a theory that small militant groups should join mainstream workers‚Äô parties in order to pull them to the left. The strategy is employed in an attempt to expand influence and was advocated by Trotsky. The Struggle at this stage was the official section of CWI in Pakistan and thus worked within PPP. In early 1990s, the Committee for a Workers International (CWI) split in two over the question of Entryism. Peter Taaffe, a prominent member of English section of the CWI advocated an ‚ÄúOpen Turn,‚Äù implying the building of an independent organization and an end to ‚ÄúEntryism‚Äù. Whereas, another faction led by Ted Grant wanted to maintain its ‚Äúentrist‚Äù strategy. The Struggle also suffered the split and Farooq Tariq, along with perhaps one dozen Struggle members, followed Peter Taaffe‚Äôs lead and went on to build an independent political party for workers in Pakistan. The other faction, led by Lal Khan, continued with its \\"entryism\\" inside the Pakistan People‚Äôs Party (PPP). According to this theory a small militant groups should join mainstream workers‚Äô parties in order to pull them to the left. The strategy is employed in an attempt to expand influence and was advocated by Trotsky. In 2016 Lal Khan is expelled from International Marxist Tendency over differences on entryism inside the Pakistan People's Party.  Current Work  Lal Khan addressing The Struggle congress. Lal Khan continued to be the editor of the Struggle magazine and leader of the Struggle group. He also wrote articles regularly for the Daily Timeshttp://dailytimes.com.pk/search/test/%C2%A0/483/Lal%20Khan and Dunya. Khan criticized the partition of India and advocated for Indian reunification through a common revolution, which he said would heal continuing wounds and solve the Kashmir conflict. His views are described his book published by The Struggle, \\"Crisis in the Indian Subcontinent, Partition: Can it be Undone?\\" in which Khan stated that \\"revolutionary transformation of the economies and societies is an essential prerequisite for the reunification of the subcontinent.\\" After death of Mr Khan, they had their successful 38th annual Congress at Lahore and vowed to carry our revolutionary work. The Struggle group has their own publication agency and has published numerous books and leaflets on topics including Marxist ideology, history of Marxist struggle in Pakistan, and various books covering history of Bolshevik revolution. Some of the books are: Partition ‚Äì Can it be undone?, Pakistan's Other Story ‚Äì The Revolution of 1968‚Äì69,http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C12%5C30%5Cstory_30-12-2008_pg11_9 and Kashmir, A revolutionary way out.

On centenary of Russian revolution; a 1,200-page translation of Leon Trotsky‚Äôs classic work, History of the Russian Revolution has been published into Urdu language by The Struggle group. The Struggle's trade union front is known as Pakistan Trade Union Defence Campaign (PTUDC), and multiple other fronts working among Youth, including Unemployed Youth Movement. In 2015, youth and students fronts of the Struggle started a campaign to bring together prominent left-wing students and youth organizations from across the country on a single platform.

Description and history The Theophilus Jones House stands in a residential area southwest of downtown Wallingford, on the west side of Jones Road south of Apple Tree Lane. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the center entrance. The second floor has a slight overhang over the first floor, and windows on both levels butt against eaves. The entrance is simply framed, with a multilight transom window above. The interior is a combination of original, recycled, and reproduction finishes. With The house was built about 1740 by Theophilus Jones, whose grandfather William was one of the original settlers of the New Haven Colony. The house and farm holdings around it remained in the Jones family until 1914, after which the farmland was progressively sold off for residential development. The house was purchased in 1937 by Charles F. Montgomery, a leading authority on American decorative arts. Montgomery lived here until 1950, during which period he undertook an extensive restoration of the property to its 18th-century appearance, removing many layers of 19th and early 20th-century finishes, reproducing some elements, and apparently relocating others.

Biography Lenzner was born in Manhattan, the son of Eleanor (Falk), a homemaker, and Joseph Lenzner, a dentist. His paternal grandparents were from Lithuania. He was raised in a secular Jewish family in Manhattan and attended Philips Exeter Academy. He graduated with a B.A. from Harvard University and with a J.D. from Harvard Law School. After school in 1964, following the advice of attorney Lloyd K. Garrison, he worked for the civil rights division of the Justice Department where he investigated the murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi. He then worked as an assistant U.S. attorney under Bob Morgenthau in the organized crime unit in New York before becoming the director of the federal office of Legal Services in the Richard Nixon administration. In 1971, he served on a team under U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark that defended the Harrisburg Seven and in 1973, under Samuel Dash, as the chief counsel on the Senate Watergate Committee. =Investigative Group International= In 1984, he founded Investigative Group International, an investigation agency with seven offices in the US as well as in London, Sydney, Australia, and Wiesbaden, Germany. IGI activities range from conducting background investigations, corporate takeovers, internal fraud investigations and \\"opposition research\\". In 1994, the law firm of Williams & Connolly, which was representing President Bill Clinton, retained his firm to investigate the source of the financing for Paula Jones' sexual misconduct lawsuit against the president. President Clinton also used the firm to investigate monies contributed by Yah Lin \\"Charlie\\" Trie to Clinton's legal defense fund. Although he did work for Republicans at times, he mostly worked for Democrats and was a close personal friend of Clinton lawyer Mickey Kantor. Several former IGI employees have links to the Clinton administration including Ricki Seidman; Interior Department official Brooke Shearer (wife of Clinton's United States Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott); undersecretary of the Treasury Raymond W. Kelly, and Howard Shapiro, general counsel to the FBI. Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr subpoenaed Lenzner (along with Sidney Blumenthal) regarding allegations that his firm was paid to find negative information regarding Starr's team and possibly \\"obstructing justice\\"; after failing to demonstrate attorney‚Äìclient privilege, Lenzner testified that his firm was doing \\"nothing inappropriate\\" with the research he was doing for Clinton. In 1994, The Clinton administration was criticized for awarding IGI a no-bid grant from the State Department to train police officers in Haiti (sending its then president, former New York City police chief, Raymond Kelly). Over the years he has been retained by numerous high profile clients to conduct opposition research. In 1991, the firm was retained in investigating United Way president William Aramony. Also in 1991, Mike Tyson used the firm to investigate the activities of his accusers and whether his jurors acted appropriately. In 1994, he was retained by Senator Ted Kennedy to investigate his opponent, which stoked some controversy when the Kennedy campaign denied employing the firm and when no record of payments to IGI were found. It was discovered that Washington lawyer James Flug had hired IGI and was reimbursed by the campaign. In 1993, he was hired by tobacco giant Brown & Williamson to investigate whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand. In 1997, the Democratic National Committee used IGI to audit political contributions. In 1996, Republican Senate candidate Robert Monks hired him to investigate his opponent's alleged sexual assault. In 1997, Lenzner was asked to find derogatory information on Republican Senator Don Nickles and his wife; Senator Joseph Lieberman criticized Lenzner's tactics as an \\"intrusion into the system.\\" Ivana Trump hired him to investigate Donald Trump's relationship with Marla Maples and to determine his financial assets. Personal life Lenzner was married to Margaret Rood Lenzner; they had three children: Jonathan Lenzner, Emily Lenzner, and William Lenzner.

It includes aspects of physics, physiology and oceanography. The practice of scientific work while diving is known as Scientific diving. These topics are covered to a greater or lesser extent in diver training programs, on the principle that understanding the concepts may allow the diver to avoid problems and deal with them more effectively when they cannot be avoided. A basic understanding of the physics of the underwater environment is foundational to the understanding of the short and long term physiological effects on the diver, and the associated hazards of the diving environment and their consequences which are inherent to diving.  Physics  Diving Physics are the aspects of physics which directly affect the underwater diver and which explain the effects that divers and their equipment are subject to underwater which differ from the normal human experience out of water. These effects are mostly consequences of immersion in water; buoyancy, the hydrostatic pressure of depth, the effects of the pressure on breathing gases and gas spaces in the diver and equipment, the inertial and viscous effects on diver movement, and the heat transfer effects. Other effects are the physical influences of the underwater environment on human sensory perception. An understanding of the physics is useful when considering the physiological effects of diving, the hazards and risks of diving, the working of underwater breathing apparatus, buoyancy control and buoyant lifting. Other foundational knowledge of physics for diving include the properties of gases and breathing gas mixtures under variations of absolute pressure and temperature, and the solubility of gases in fluids.  Physiology  The human physiology of underwater diving is the physiological influences of the underwater environment on human divers, and adaptations to operating underwater, both during breath-hold dives and while breathing at ambient pressure from a suitable breathing gas supply. It, therefore, includes both the physiology of breath-hold diving in humans, and the range of physiological effects generally limited to human ambient pressure divers either freediving or using underwater breathing apparatus. Several factors affect the diver, including immersion, exposure to the water, the limitations of breath-hold endurance, variations in ambient pressure, the effects of breathing gases at raised ambient pressure, effects caused by the use of breathing apparatus, and sensory impairment. All of these may affect diver performance and safety. Immersion affects fluid balance, circulation and work of breathing. Exposure to cold water can result in the harmful cold shock response, the helpful diving reflex and excessive loss of body heat. Breath-hold duration is limited by oxygen reserves, and the risk of hypoxic blackout, which has a high associated risk of drowning. Large or sudden changes in ambient pressure have the potential for injury known as barotrauma. Breathing under pressure involves several effects. Metabolically inactive gases are absorbed by the tissues and may have narcotic or other undesirable effects, and must be released slowly to avoid the formation of bubbles during decompression. Metabolically active gases have a greater effect in proportion to their concentration, which is proportional to their partial pressure, which for contaminants is increased in proportion to absolute ambient pressure. Work of breathing is increased by increased density of the breathing gas, artifacts of the breathing apparatus, and hydrostatic pressure variations due to posture in the water. High work of breathing and large combinations of physiological and mechanical dead space can lead to hypercapnia, which may induce a panic response. The underwater environment also affects sensory input, which can impact on safety and the ability to function effectively at depth. Other physiological effects become apparent at greater depths and where alternative breathing gas mixtures are used to mitigate some of these effects. Nitrogen narcosis occurs under high partial pressures of nitrogen, and helium is substituted to avoid or reduce this effect. High pressure nervous syndrome affects divers breathing helium mixes during rapid compression to high pressures, Compression arthralgia can also affect divers during rapid compression to high pressures. Long decompression times can be reduced by higher oxygen content of breathing gas, but this can expose the diver to oxygen toxicity effects, and changing from helium to nitrogen diluted gases during decompression can cause isobaric counterdiffusion problems. Toxicity of breathing gas contaminants is proportional to partial pressure, and a gas which may have no effect at the surface can be dangerously toxic at higher ambient pressure. Hypoxia of ascent can affect freedivers and rebreather divers, and in occasional circumstances scuba and surface-supplied divers, and can be a killer, as the diver can lose consciousness without warning and consequently drown or asphyxiate.  Environment  The ocean and aquatic environment is described by oceanography and limnology. These are directly influenced by aspects of geology, weather and climate. The underwater environment is inhabited by organisms of great diversity, some of which may be hazardous to the diver, or affect the dive in some way. Sufficient knowledge and a basic understanding of the expected environment for an intended dive allow the diver to predict the conditions which may reasonably be expected during the dive, and allow reasonable estimation of hazards and associated risk, which allows effective dive planning. There are a range of environmental hazards which should be considered during dive planning. The other side of understanding of the environment by divers is the impact of diving activity on the environment. The environmental impact of recreational diving on the popular tropical coral reef environment has been extensively studied, and there are known adverse effects due to poor diving skills and lack of environmental awareness, which can be addressed by training and education. While commercial diving operations can also have significant environmental impact, they are less frequent, and where environmental impact is expected to be an issue it should be considered in the environmental impact study for the specific contract or project. Similarly, scientific diving environmental impact should be estimated during planning, and be subject to acceptance by the relevant ethics committee.

He published some 125 books in many genres including travel books, children's stories, and biographies, many with his own illustrations and photographs. Early life and marriage Clifton Johnson was born on January 25, 1865 in the village of Hockanum in Hadley, Massachusetts. He was the oldest child of Chester S. Johnson and Jeanette (n√©e Reynolds) and had three siblings: two brothers, Charles (b. 1867) and Henry R. (b. 1868), and one sister, Jeanette L., known as Nettie (b.1872). He attended a local, one room schoolhouse, and then, the Hopkins Academy in Hadley. He dropped out at age 15 and spent five years working at the Bridgman & Lyman bookstore in Northampton before moving to New York City to study at the Art Students League of New York.(1940, January 23) Clifton Johnson of Hockanum Dies in Brattleboro. \\"Springfield Republican\\", p.1. Connecticut River in Hadley The Johnson family farm was located on the shore of the Connecticut River and, as a boy, Johnson enjoyed all that the river offered; boating, fishing, bathing, and skating in winter. Along with other boys, he enjoyed freeing logs that were caught in the river's curving shores after they were sent down-current from Canadian forests. During his early life, he barely traveled outside of Hockanum which \\"was hardly big enough to deserve the name ‚Äòvillage,‚Äô\\"Hartt, M.B. (1901). \\"Clifton Johnson and His Pictures of New England Life\\" The New England Magazine, Vol. 24, p.662. and he only traveled as far as Holyoke or Northampton to peddle berries. He was a self-described \\"hoodlum\\" and along with his friends \\"[w]e just delighted to steal apples, watermelons, and everything else.\\"LeBlanc, B. (July 21, 1981). Hadley's Clifton Johnson: chronicler of his times. Daily Hampshire Gazette, p. 10. As a student, he disliked mathematics and classics preferring history and natural science, especially botany for which he had a great passion and allowed him to be outdoors. Married Anna Tweed McQueston, a local school teacher, on May 25, 1896 and went on a honeymoon (which doubled as a work trip for Clifton) to England, Scotland, Ireland, and France. The couple had six children: Margaret (b. 1898), Arthur (b. 1900), Roger (b. 1901), Irving (b. 1905), later a sailor and captain of the \\"Charmian\\" as well as his own three ships all named Yankee, on which he and his wife Electa circumnavigated the world seven times, Katherine (b. 1911), and Oliver (December 15, 1902 ‚Äì March 10, 1903) who died in infancy.Nelson, A. (Ed.). (1928). Who's Who in America 1928‚Äì1929 (Vol. 15), p. 1149. Career Even though he received little formal education, Johnson became an accomplished author, photographer, artist, editor, and folklorist. The anthropologist Carl Withers considered him a \\"skillful and often graceful writer, and ‚Ä¶ a foremost pioneer photographer of folk life ‚Ä¶ He was gifted to extraordinary degree with a ‚Äòlistener's ear.‚Äô Johnson's involvement with folklore, as collector and reporter and as editor of folktale collections for children, is that of a social anthropologist interested in American folkways and folklore.\\"Johnson, C. (1963) Introduction. What they say in New England. In C. Withers (Ed.) New York: Columbia University Press, pp. vii‚Äìviii. His first commission, to illustrate Wonderful deeds and doings of little giant Boab and his talking raven Tabib, a children‚Äôs book by Ingersoll Lockwood, came in 1890, followed by Little Captain Doppelkop by the same author a year later. Also starting in 1890, an ambitious project by the Northampton, MA based Wade, Warner and Co. Publishers asked Johnson to supply photographs for Picturesque Hampshire, to which he contributed hundreds of photographs and drawings.Johnson, C. (1963) Introduction. What they say in New England. In C. Withers (Ed.) New York: Columbia University Press, p.x. Five volumes followed in the series. The 1890s were also filled with books about country life in New England, a topic close to Johnson's heart and in which he was immersed all his life. The New England Country (1892) was successful enough to bring commissions from different publishers which resulted in The Farmer's Boy (1894), The Country School in New England (1895), and What They Say in New England (1896). His Old-time Schools and School-books (1904) was a scholarly study of early educational methods and materials based on examination of many early textbooks and especially Puritan Massachusetts. Writing in 1999, Martin Br√ºckner referred to it as \\"old but still useful\\" when \\"a more detailed publishing history of geographic literature circulating in the early republic\\" was required.Br√ºckner, M. (1999 June). Lessons in Geography: Maps, Spellers, and Other Grammars of Nationalism in the Early Republic. American Quarterly Vol.51, No.3, p. 339. His first few books prompted publishers to send Johnson on trips to England, Scotland, and Ireland to take photographs for reissues of classic popular books by the likes of J. M. Barrie, Jane Barlow and Ian Maclaren. On his second trip in 1896, he also visited France. He returned with hundreds of photographs, drawings, and notebooks filled with impressions, and, with the exception of France, folklore he gathered from the locals. From these he produced books about each country: Among English Hedgerows (1899), Along French Byways (1900), The Isle of the Shamrock (1901), and The Land of Heather (1903) as well as magazine articles. A special emphasis in the English books is put on children, their games, festivals, and everyday activities. Writing A photograph of a man drinking out of a jug with a corresponding illustration in Along French Byways, 1900.Clifton Johnson had an interest for everyday life of people in the countryside and did oral history before the term existed. He arrived at writing through photography. He wrote \\"to explain the pictures.\\"Crawford, M. C. (November 20, 1904). An artist turns author to explain his pictures. Sunday Boston Herald, p.6. Clifton Johnson published articles for the Daily Hampshire Gazette and the Springfield Republican before publishing his first book, The New England Country (1892). He wrote travel guides, children's books, and biographies. His series of travel books, Highways and Byways of America, published in the first two decades of the 20th century and covering forty-eight states focused especially on rustic life. He preferred byways to the highways as he stated in the preface to New England and its Neighbors: \\"The general title of Highways and Byways, adopted for the American series, indicates very well the writer's itinerary; but, as for the highways, it is their humbler features I love best, and it is these I linger over in my pictures and descriptions. Wherever I go the characteristic and picturesque phases of the local farm environment always appeal strongly to me, and in what I have written I have tried to convey to others the same interest I have felt, and at the same time have endeavored to give a clear and truthful impression of the reality\\".Johnson, C. (1902). New England and its Neighbors, p. xv. Elsewhere he writes: ‚ÄúMy rambling has been in the fields and woodlands, my stopping-places in the little villages and scattered farmhouses, and I write almost wholly of rustic life and nature as I saw them in my desultory journeyings.‚ÄùJohnson, C. (1905) Highways & Byways of the South, p. xv. He also wrote books on New England country life, including The Country School (1893), The Farmer's Boy (1894), What They Say in New England (1897), which Herbert Halpert described as \\"excellent,\\"Halpert, H. (1947). American Regional Folklore. The Journal of American Folklore, Vol.60, No.238, p. 357. and New England: a Human Interest Geographical Reader(1917). Referring to his writing, Johnson highlighted his approach of simply talking with people: ‚ÄúMy method? Oh, it is all simple enough. I go out a good deal like a reporter, though I do not so proclaim myself, and talk along with the people I meet, getting friendly with them, you know, until suddenly they say something which is unusual or picturesque. Then out comes my notebook. Sometimes they ask me why I am writing down what they have said, and I tell them it is because it has interested me. Usually that suffices.‚ÄùCrawford, p.6. According to Carl Withers, his travel books showed evidence of the life history method and read \\"like the field records of an anthropologist.\\" He had a keen ear for details of speech patterns which he recreated in his notes, and showed great skill in suggesting differing social levels of speech and dialects. He used the same method when writing the biographies of John Burroughs, Hudson Maxim, and George M. Stearns.Johnson, What They Say in New England, pp. xiv‚Äìxv. Cover of the 1912 editionJohnson's interest in folklore and his natural ability to talk to children and create an understanding with them led to creating works in the growing and lucrative children's market. Similarly patterned to and perhaps inspired by the works by Andrew Lang, he created a series named for trees: The Oak Tree Fairy (1905), The Birch Tree Fairy Book (1906), The Elm Tree Fairy Book (1908), and The Fir Tree Fairy Book (1912). He followed these with a fifteen volume series of Bedtime Wonder Tales. Despite their appeal as well written stories, Johnson‚Äôs moralistic tales tend to reflect his own Puritan values and prevailing educational standards although he highlights the progressive system which sought to be more attractive to children rather than education by ‚Äúrote and rod.‚ÄùWithers, Carl. (1963 Fall). ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Been Reading What They Say in New England.‚Äù Columbia University Forum. Vol.6 No.4, pp. 39‚Äì42. Inspired by Felix Adler's sentiment that ‚Äúfalsehood, gluttony, drunkenness, and evil‚Äù should not be a significant part of children's tales, Johnson edited out many cruelties. In his version of the Little Red Riding Hood, the wolf is killed by grandma with an axe and Little Red Riding Hood is not harmed. His Mother Goose Tales My Children Love Best (1917) omits some harsh sentiments and are supplanted with rhymes that seem to have come from the New England folklore. Despite these changes and differences, Carl Withers found \\"his versions sound more like oral, rather than literary narratives,\\" and even though \\"[p]resent standards regarding anthologies and the simplification of great literature and folktales for the children's book market are different from his (but only rarely better.)\\"Johnson, What They Say in New England, pp. xix‚Äìxx. Photography Clifton Johnson with his camera An avid photographer, Johnson photographed life with a focus on country life and people. The focus on rustic life made his photographs especially valuable. He bought his first camera in 1888 as an aid to his drawings but after a publisher purchased his photographs, Johnson decided to focus on them as much as on drawings. He especially focused on his native Hadley and the New England states but also took photographs in the forty eight continental states as well as numerous cities and villages in France, England, Scotland, and Ireland. He illustrated a number of well-known books including Charles Dickens's Child's History of England (1898), three-volume White's Natural History of Selborne (1895), R. D. Blackmore's Lorna Doone (1900), and David Thoreau's Cape Cod (1908), Maine Woods (1909), and Walden (1910).Who's who in American art 1564‚Äì1975 (1999). Sound View Press, (Vol. 2), p.1738.Who Was Who in America 1897‚Äì1942. (1942). The A. N. Marquis Company, vol. 1, p.637. For Johnson, \\"art for art's sake\\" was not the supreme motive and his interest and passion in New England life, as well as folk life in general, gave his work a unity of meaning and his photographs show significant purpose as well as beauty. Instead of focusing on the unlikely, the exceptional, or surprising, his camera chose the usual, the everyday, and perhaps even the mundane which he turned into a visual poetry.Hartt, 664. Rural life in Hadley, MA photographed by Johnson. Johnson viewed photography in similar terms to painting and composed his photographs in that fashion. He stated that he selected subjects in the same fashion as he would for paintings and posed them in a way that represent \\"naturalness of life as I see it.\\" Once the prints were developed, he would \\"paint on them with great care, blot out, put in, get all the art and suggestion I can into them. Sometimes I paint over almost the entire surface‚Ä¶ if you go about it in the right way you can get at realities and the heart of things as you can by no other method.\\"(January 1897)Chronicle and Comment. ‚Äô‚ÄôThe Bookman ‚Äì A Literary Journal, p.408-409. Even though the technical shortcomings of cameras of the late 19th century required that the subjects pose for photographs, the people in Johnson's works are in their natural environment performing the same tasks as before Johnson asked them for a photograph. According to Mary Bronson Hartt, his photography was \\"[r]elieved by its very aims from the strain of the quest for sensation, Johnson's work is singularly restful to eyes long wearied by the monotony of surprise.\\" His approach of foregoing studio models made his photographs \\"of life,\\" not \\"from life,\\" and his models were \\"not only alive, but living.\\"Hartt, 664. Johnson treated a print as a rough draft and at times retouched them by adding clouds and birds, toning down whites and heavy blacks, or even removing details or objects to make the photograph \\"tell its story more simply and gracefully.\\"Johnson, What they say in New England, p.xiv. Because of this compositional simplicity, Johnson framed one aspect, whether a person or event in a way that easily draws the eye while the environment does not pine for supremacy bewildering the senses. Using impressionist techniques and approaches, he would use a light blur to soften the hard and dim distinctness of details like grasses or forests. In this his photographs show \\"not things as they are, but things as they look.\\"Hartt, 666-7. He preferred to work on hazy and misty days so as to more naturally come upon the effect of graduated blur unlike clear and sunny days which \\"makes his pictures unideally sharp and hard, and fills them with broken glitters of light and scattered flecks of shadow, which fritter away effect.\\" During a misty day, mist, smoke, or even dust softened the dazzling contrasts and subdued the overall appearance of his photographs.Hartt, 668. Johnson took photographs towards the sun, rather than away from it, because subjects lighted from behind were given \\"solidity and mass and the appearance of enveloping air,\\" whereas subjects lighted from the front looked \\"shallow and weak and thin, and they do not separate themselves from the background.\\"Hartt, pp. 668‚Äì669. Tours of United States and Europe Anna McQueston Johnson standing under an arched entryway in the ruins of Logie House in Scotland. Johnson took expansive trips across the United States and Europe to illustrate and photograph each geographical area for commissioned works and his own books. In 1895, D. Appleton and Company sent him to England to illustrate a new edition of White's Natural History of Selborne, followed by an 1896 trip commissioned by Dodd, Mead and Company to illustrate Ian Maclaren's Bonnie Brier Bush (1896) and ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Days of Auld Lang Syne‚Äô‚Äô (which the New York times predicted would appeal to the reading public and prove popular as gifts),(1896, December 12). The Book Stores: A Tour of Shelves and Counters ‚Äì What Each House Has to Show ‚Äì A Guide and Directory. The New York Times, p.A10. as well as Barrie‚Äôs Window in Thrums (1896). On his third trip to Great Britain (1897), Johnson took photographs for an illustrated edition of Charles Dicken's Illustrated History of England (1898). He traveled by train, stagecoach, river boat, canal barge, hired horse or even by foot. He liked to stay in small towns and villages rather than cities and preferred to sleep in farmhouses which he felt gave him a better chance to observe habitual behavior and talk of everyday life. He disliked large cities as too cosmopolitan to be authentic and on one occasion he arrived in London with the intention of remaining there for several days but \\"the big town seemed so dingy and commonplace, and there was so much of crowds and noise, that I changed my mind and toward evening took a train that carried me northward.\\"Johnson C.

Johnson‚Äôs Bookstore In April 1893, Henry and Clifton bought a small stationery and notion shop at 318 Main Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, owned by Miss S. I. Cooley with Clifton providing financial backing for the endeavor. The 800 square foot location was named ‚Äò‚ÄôHenry R. Johnson‚Äôs Blank Books.‚Äô‚Äô Henry was Clifton‚Äôs younger brother and dropped out of Hopkins Academy to take the ferry to Northampton and work at College Bookstore to help pay off the family mortgage in 1885.

Clifton designed the store‚Äôs logo, a shallop, a type of boat that operated on the Connecticut River by early settlers that moved north from Wethersfield, Connecticut. The design followed the store as it relocated to ever larger locations several times and served as the logo of the store until its closure in 1998. When Johnson was not travelling, he visited the store every Tuesday and Friday and even though Henry was the owner, the two were close and Clifton served as an advisor and silent partner. Clifton sponsored art exhibits featuring many artists. Edward Walton who managed the art supplies department co-maintained the gallery. Johnson‚Äôs two sons, Arthur and Roger bought the store from Henry in 1922 becoming the first members of the second generation to own the store which remained in the family until its closure in 1998.Humberston, M., Cheek, Z. & Johnson, C.

Retrieved from Springfield Museums Philanthropic work and community involvement Johnson donated time and money to a number of local endeavors. Beside sitting on the school committee and writing an account of the local one-room schoolhouse (The Country School, 1895), he published a book on the history of his town, Historic Hadley: quarter millennial souvenir, 1659‚Äì1909 (1909) and made numerous donations to the local First Congregational Church including a $10,000 (well in excess of $100,000 in 2018) donation he made for the church's renovations without mentioning the gift to his family.LeBlanc, p.10. Clifton and Henry collaborated to open a farm museum in 1930 after Henry's collection of farm- related antiques outgrew his house, garage, and Clifton's barn spaces. The two brothers wanted to showcase items significant to labor in the fields. Dr. James Huntington of Boston, who spent his summers in Northern Hadley on his family's estate, offered his family's 53 x 66 ft. barn dating back to 1782 as a gift. Against the recommendations of architects and experts, instead of disassembling and reassembling the barn in its new location, the brothers moved the building as a whole over winter and spring. The building was dedicated on May 27, 1930, supposedly on the date of its raising in 1782, with ceremonies held at the meetinghouse.Johnson C. (July 1932).

The following year she obtained a Masters in Social Science at the Institute of Psychology, Uppsala University in Sweden, where she worked with Gunnar Jansson on haptic/tactile perception in blind individuals. Holmes received her Doctorate in Clinical Psychology at Royal Holloway University of London in 2000, under the supervision of Chris Brewin. Her research with Brewin focused on PTSD and intrusive memories. Holmes received her PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Cambridge University in 2005, mentored by Andrew Mathews. Her research with Mathews demonstrated the powerful role of mental imagery in generating emotional responses. Holmes was awarded the prestigious Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship in 2005 in support of her research at the University of Oxford. In 2010, Holmes was awarded a Wellcome Trust Clinical Fellowship and was appointed Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Oxford. From 2012-2016 Holmes was a Program Leader at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences unit at Cambridge University.  Research  Holmes's major interest is in mental imagery, its effect on emotion, and how it can be used in cognitive behavior therapy to increase the effectiveness of treatments for anxiety and mood disorders. With Andrew Matthews, Holmes outlined three different ways that mental imagery alters emotional experiences. First, mental imagery engages the same neurocircuitry that underlies the processing of sensory signals, which serves to direct attention towards potentially threatening stimuli, for example. Second, as a consequence of the overlapping neurocircuitry, one is able to mentally place oneself in an emotionally arousing situation and experience heightened emotions as if the situation were real. Third, the act of remembering past experiences may bring up emotions as if one were reliving the experience (autonoetic consciousness). Holmes leads the Experimental Psychopathology and Cognitive Therapy Research Group (EPaCT) at the University of Oxford. EPaCT members have developed computerized technologies (including computer games) for psychotherapy to modify people's existing cognitive biases, change negative thinking styles, and reduce the impact of intrusive memories. Holmes is part of a research team aimed at developing inexpensive yet effective therapies to help refugees recover from PTSD and other trauma-related psychological disorders.

Between September 2010 and February 2014, he killed five girls aged between 11 and 22 in the Kamchatka Krai. In the media, he received the nickname \\"Kamchatka Chikatilo\\". He was detained on February 17, 2014 and charged with murder, as well as raping his underage stepdaughter. On February 19, 2016, the Kamchatka Regional Court sentenced him to life imprisonment, with the Supreme Court of Russia upholding the verdict without change. On August 5, 2016 while he was being transferred to the colony on Ognenny Ostrov, Tushinsky suddenly died.  Biography  Tushinsky was born on September 14, 1976. In 1997, he was convicted of theft and beatings, and according to some media reports, was nicknamed \\"Bald\\" in the colony. After his release, he married, and along with his wife and her daughter from her first marriage, moved to the Pionersky settlement in the Yelizovsky District; a son was born there soon after. In the autumn of 2009, he got a job as a fuel supply engineer in boiler room No. 3 of JSC Kamchatskenegro in the Mokhovaya micro-district of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. According to the investigators, in 2005, Tushinsky raped his 11-year-old stepdaughter, Julia, and then continued to coerce her into cohabitation for four years. The girl did not dare for a long time to tell anybody what happened. In 2009, when she turned 16, she moved to the mainland, where her parents lived.  Murders  After his stepdaughter was able to leave Tushinsky, investigators believe that because of his inability to satisfy his \\"pathological sexual desire\\", a hatred for women arose. He began to drive around Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in his Toyota 4Runner in search of lone girls resembling his stepdaughter, and would offer them a ride. Once under his control, he would kill them either by stabbing or strangulation. The first victim was 22-year-old Ulyana Nikiforova, who worked as a saleswoman in one of the shopping centers of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky; she was killed on September 12, 2010. The offender, who used a knife, inflicted numerous blows to the face, head and body. The body was found in the tall grass next to the road connecting Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and Yelizovo. Tushinsky committed the next murder a month later. In the evening of October 10, 15-year-old Natalya Moiseyeva stood by a \\"BAM\\" shop waiting for the bus, where she was seen by the criminal. Shortly before her disappearance, the schoolgirl phoned her parents and said that she could not go home, because there was no bus; after 20 minutes her phone was out of range. The remains of the girl were found two years later by a woman who was collecting mushrooms in the Mokhovaya micro- district. On November 18, 2010, the criminal killed 11-year-old Olga Besprozvannaya, a high school student in Yelizovo, and then buried her corpse. Her parents told the police about her disappearance after she did not return to the village of Dvurechye after the end of the school day. For several weeks police and volunteers were looking for her, but they could only find her mobile phone, broken into pieces. On January 9, 2011, Tushinsky killed 16-year-old Christina Orlova. The search operation again did not give any results, because, as in the Besprozvannaya case, the criminal carefully buried the body in a secret place. The last murder Tushinsky committed was on February 16, 2014 in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. He offered to give a ride to 20-year-old Irina Khodos, but she refused. \\"I just stopped and in a friendly way offered to give her a lift, and she became rude. She took out her phone, and threatened to call the police. I got scared, got in the car, but then I thought that she could blame me\\", the murderer later told.–°–µ–¥–æ–≤ –í. –£–±–∏–π—Ü–∞ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–ª –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç—É —Å–ª–∞–≤—ã, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å –º–∞–Ω—å—è–∫–æ–º // –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∫–æ–º—Å–æ–º–æ–ª–µ—Ü : –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞. ‚Äî ‚Ññ 26471 (6 –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ 2014). He inflicted more than 20 knife wounds on the girl, after which she died. He left the body at the \\"Stepnaya\\" bus stop, where it was later discovered. = Arrest = After the murder of Irina Khodos, the investigators contacted the locals through the media for help, counting on the fact that among them there might have been witnesses of the crime. After a while a man came to the regional department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, passing a stop with his car when, according to him, the murder was committed. The DVR camera captured the Toyota 4Runner parked near the murder site; the registration numbers were not visible, however, the inscription \\"PICK UP\\" on the cockpit was visible. Law enforcement agencies discovered that the car belonged to Tushinsky, and on February 17, he was arrested. In the trunk of Tushinsky's car was an axe, taser, air gun, as well as female tights and an artificial vagina. After examining the car, traces of blood and hair from Khodos were found. Under the pressure of increasing evidence, the killer began to give confessions: he not only confessed to the last murder, but also to his previous crimes, and subsequently pointed out the burial sites of the bodies of Besprozvannaya and Orlova. During the search of Tushinsky's apartment, video records were found on his computer, on which he committed violent acts against his minor stepdaughter. Soon the court gave Tushinsky a measure of restraint in the form of imprisonment, thus satisfying the petition of the investigation. A criminal case was initiated against him on the basis of crimes such as violent acts of a sexual nature, rape and murder of the Criminal Code of Russia.  Trial  In early September 2015, Tushinsky's case, along with the indictment were referred to the court for examination. Previously, experts conducted more than 60 examinations, including complex forensic psycho-sexual ones, which revealed that the man showed signs of pedophilia, but was declared sane. At the same time, the investigators failed to find evidence that the murderer's victims had been sexually assaulted. The trial itself began on October 7, 2015 in the Kamchatka Regional Court. During the judicial investigation, more than 70 volumes of the criminal case were examined. On January 27, 2016, the judicial debate began. The state prosecutor asked the court to appoint a final sentence in the form of life imprisonment to the defendant. Family members of the victims, who also spoke in the debate, supported the position of the prosecution. Tushinsky's lawyer asked for a softer punishment towards his client. After the end of the debate, the court decided to appoint the last word of the defendant on February 9, but on the appointed day Tushinsky was not ready, as a result of which the meeting was postponed and held on February 11 instead. In his last words, he pled guilty to all counts and at the same time drew the court's attention to the contradictions in the victims' testimonies, witnesses, and the inadmissibility of a number of evidence materials in the case. Among other things, Tushinsky asked for forgiveness from the victims' families and said that he would \\"accept any punishment\\". On February 19, 2016, the final hearing for the case took place. Tushinsky was found guilty of all counts and sentenced to life imprisonment, and to serve his sentence in a special regime colony. The court also granted civil claims to relatives of the victims for the amount of 12 million rubles, and also obliged the defendant to pay 500,000 rubles to his stepdaughter. The verdict was read out by the judge of the Kamchatka Regional Court, Dmitry Urban. Tushinsky's defense team challenged the verdict. In July 2016, the Board of the Supreme Court inspected a video depicting the convict and three of the victims, and ultimately upheld the verdict without change. = Death = After the enforcement of the verdict, Tushinsky was ordered to serve his sentence in the special regime colony in Ognenny Ostrov. From Kamchatka, he was taken to a prison in Khabarovsk, where he was placed in solitary confinement under enhanced surveillance, which, in particular, had round-the-clock surveillance. On August 5, 2016, Tushinsky died suddenly. According to official information, the cause of death was \\"sudden cardiac arrest without signs of violent death\\": according to the press service of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia in the Khabarovsk Oblast, at 17:50 the junior inspector received information that offender was ill. The medical officer, who examined him in the cell, called an ambulance brigade. At 18:58, the prisoner was taken to the intensive care unit of the Regional Clinical Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 20:05.

This species is native to much of Europe and is to be seen in the breeding season on recently dead timber or wood products. The larvae are parasitoids of the larvae of wood-boring beetles. Description Stephanid wasps are known as crown wasps because the top of the wasp's head bears a group of five tubercles. The somewhat elongated prothorax is connected to the propodeum (the first abdominal segment) by a very long petiole, and the ventral side of the hind femur bears teeth. The male S. serrator averages in length and the female , with an ovipositor of . The slender body and legs are black, apart from the front half of the abdomen and certain leg segments, which are red. Distribution S. serrator is known from Spain, France, Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro. Adults can be found on and around trees that have been dead for about a year and which contain beetle larvae, but which have not yet been invaded by fungi; this wasp has been recorded parasitising several different host species. It is usually found in forests or other rural locations, but when recorded from Romania for the first time in 2015, the wasps were found on a timber shed in an urban environment. Other non-natural habitats where it has been observed include fencing, utility poles, wooden boarding and stacked firewood, in each case attracted by beetle larvae within. Ecology S. serrator is a parasitoid of the larvae of wood- boring beetles. Despite being able to fly, these wasps usually move about by walking and usually avoid sunlight. Spiders such as Nuctenea umbratica and Parasteatoda spp. sometimes feed on the wasps, but the wasps usually manage to evade them. Female wasps that are trying to locate beetle larvae in wood adopt a characteristic posture with fore and hind legs spread widely, middle legs folded tightly against the body, antennae lowered and ovipositor sheath pressed against the wood; they then move a few centimetres to a new location and repeat the process. When a potential target is located, the ovipositor is bored into the substrate. Boring may take many hours, with rests in between the boring efforts, at which times the females withdraw their ovipositors. They seem to be able to re-locate the hole they were working on when they recommence boring. As the ovipositor is pushed deeper into the wood, the sheath arches upwards in a loop. The eggs are laid in the galleries created by the beetle larvae. The developing wasp larvae feed on the beetle larvae, rejecting the most heavily chitinised parts. When fully developed they pupate in the galleries left by the beetle larvae. Male wasps emerge some ten days before the females and adopt a similar search posture, perhaps waiting for the females to emerge.

The crater was formed between 230,000 and 300,000 years ago, as the result of the eruption of volcano Pu'u' 'Uao. It is located in the center of the Kalaupapa Peninsula on the island of Moloka ªi, and has a diameter of by . Lake Kauhak≈ç, located at the bottom of the crater, has the world's greatest depth-to-surface area ratio of a lake and is the fourth deepest lake in the United States. In 2011, the lake underwent an overturning event, causing hydrogen sulfide to float to the surface of the lake and lifeforms, including shrimp and plankton, to disappear.  Formation  Kauhak≈ç Crater is thought to have formed around 230,000 to 300,000 years ago. Somewhere within this time period, Pu'u 'Uao, an undersea volcano located near what is now the peninsula, first erupted. After this, it continued to erupt several more times, spewing hot, fast lava. When this lava eventually cooled, the peninsula was formed, including Kauhak≈ç Crater.  Geography and geology  Kauhak≈ç Crater's location on the Kalaupapa Peninsula. Kauhak≈ç Crater is found in the center of the Kalaupapa Peninsula. It is located inside a volcanic rim, which is roughly above sea level, making it the highest point on the peninsula. The crater's diameter is by , and is funnel-like in shape. A single terrace roughly 150 meters wide is located in the crater, above the lake. Much of the crater is forested, containing many types of shrubs and trees, such as the wiliwili, a plant native to the area, but mostly non-native plants, including invasive Schinus terebinthifolia (Brazilian peppertree) and Lantana camara (big-sage). A survey observed that black rats in the area were destroying certain native plants in the crater, particularly the endemic tree species Reynoldsia sandwicensis. The crater contains many lava channels and tubes, which vary significantly in size. In particular, a kilometer-long lava channel, which is up to 150 meters wide and 30 meters deep, begins at the crater's northeastern side and continues north. This channel contains many smaller channels and tubes that branch out of it.  Lake  The crater contains a lake named Lake Kauhak≈ç at the bottom. The lake has a depth of , as confirmed by the U.S. Navy, and a much lesser width of , making the depth-to-surface area ratio of the lake greater than any other lake in the world. It is also the fourth- deepest lake in the United States. The shallower parts of the lake contain brackish water and are full of oxygen, which is where most of the plants and animals of the lake live, including plankton, shrimp, and copepods. The lake's water quality is inspected by the National Park Service 4 times a year, which has occurred since 2009. In September 2011, the NPS saw that the surface of the lake was covered in a white layer, which revealed that hydrogen sulfide was floating to the surface of the lake and into the atmosphere. It is believed that this event occurred either due to a drought that caused the surface water, which contained a large amount of oxygen, to evaporate, or because of a landslide. After this overturning event, multiple aspects of the water quality changed significantly, most notably the oxygen level; In August, the percentage of dissolved oxygen (relative to saturation) was 227.37 (i.e. oversaturated); however, it dropped to 2.52 by November. This caused much of the life in the lake to die, including shrimp and phytoplankton. Before this event, no instance of the lake being unusual was recorded from observation, nor has anything similar been recorded in historical times. After the event, the lake was observed consistently for a while. Observations on December 8 and December 12, 2011 showed that the layer was gone and the lake was a bluish green color, but there were still no shrimp. A few days later, on December 14, the lake was covered in a green layer of phytoplankton due to a heavy rain the last 48 hours. This caused shrimp and other forms of life to appear again, but by December 16, there was no life at the lake and it was colored bluish green again.

Jel√≠nek was arrested by the Gestapo shortly after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, ruler of the Nazi- occupied Czech lands and the leading architect of The Holocaust. The objective of the game is to establish what role he played in the attack, as well as the reason for his arrest. Throughout the investigation, players interview eyewitnesses, discover the family's back story and learn more about life in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Development The game was developed by Charles University and the Czech Academy of Sciences. It is the first game in the Czechoslovakia 38-89 project, which covers different events from contemporary history. Attentat 1942 is a significantly enhanced version of the game \\"ƒåeskoslovensko 38-89: Atent√°t\\", which was released in the Czech language in 2015, adapted and changed for an international audience. Revenues from the game are to be invested into the continuing research and science in their field. The core development team is composed of the lead game designer, V√≠t ≈†isler (from the Faculty of Arts), the lead programmer, Jakub Gemrot (from the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics), art director Richard Alexander, and students from Charles University and historians from the Institute of Contemporary History of the Czech Academy of Sciences. The illustrations were created by Peter Nov√°k (Ticho 762), and the music was composed by the band DVA, which also created soundtracks for the games Botanicula and Chuchel. The game was released for Windows and Mac on Steam on October 31, 2017. Subsequent GNU/Linux version was made available in Spring 2020 as well as mobile/tablet versions in summer that year. The game is available in Czech, with English, Russian, and German subtitles. = Release = The game was released on Steam in October 2017. It was available worldwide, except for Germany, where it was banned due to German laws barring games containing Nazi symbols. In May 2018, Attentat 1942 won the \\"Most Amazing Game\\" Award at the A MAZE festival in Berlin, although attendees could not play it. In August 2018, the policy of USK, the authority providing age ratings for video games, was changed to allow games with Nazi symbolism to receive age ratings, depending on their individual \\"social adequacy\\". Attentat 1942 was released in Germany as the first PC game with Nazi symbolism with the USK age rating after the policy change.  Reception  The game holds a 75% rating on Metacritic based on thirteen generally favorable reviews. Rock, Paper, Shotgun stated: \\"[Attentat 1942] captivates from start to finish by humanizing history brilliantly.\\" Destructoid's review was also positive: \\"Attentat 1942 will be a treasure not only for a fresh perspective on a widely reported period of time but also for the amount of work that you can see the developers put into making sure their story fit within the confines of history.\\" = Awards = * \\"Most Amazing Game\\" at A MAZE festival in Germany. * \\"Best Learning Game\\" at Games for Change in the U.S. * \\"Excellence in Narrative\\" nomination at Independent Games Festival in the U.S. * Second place at the Game Development World Championship in Finland * Czech Game of the Year 2017 * \\"Educational Game\\" at The Independent Game Developers' Association Awards 2018 in the UK  References  Category:2017 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Educational video games Category:MacOS games Category:Video games developed in the Czech Republic Category:Windows games Category:World War II video games Category:History educational video games ","title":"Attentat 1942"},{"id":"58543932","text":"The following is a list of controversies involving the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Throughout its history, the FBI has been the subject of a number of controversial cases, both at home and abroad. Files on U.S. citizens The FBI has maintained files on numerous people, including celebrities such as Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, John Denver, John Lennon, Jane Fonda, Groucho Marx, Charlie Chaplin, the band MC5, Lou Costello, Sonny Bono, Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, and Mickey Mantle. The reason for the existence of the files varied. Some of the subjects were investigated for alleged ties to the Communist party (Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx), or in connection with antiwar activities during the Vietnam War (John Denver, John Lennon, and Jane Fonda). Numerous celebrity files concern threats or extortion attempts against them (Sonny Bono, John Denver, John Lennon, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Mickey Mantle, Groucho Marx, and Frank Sinatra). Covert operations on political groups Image from the FBI monograph of the Nation of Islam (1965): Elijah Muhammad COINTELPRO tactics have been alleged to include discrediting targets through psychological warfare, smearing individuals and/or groups using forged documents and by planting false reports in the media, harassment, wrongful imprisonment, and illegal violence, including assassination.The FBI'S Covert Action Program to Destroy the Black Panther Party FBI Secrets: An Agent's Expose.

THE FBI, Yale University Press, 2008, p. 189 including communist and socialist organizations; organizations and individuals associated with the civil rights movement, including Martin Luther King Jr. and others associated with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Congress of Racial Equality and other civil rights organizations; black nationalist groups (e.g., Nation of Islam and the Black Panther Party); the American Indian Movement; a broad range of organizations labeled \\"New Left\\", including Students for a Democratic Society and the Weathermen; almost all groups protesting the Vietnam War, as well as individual student demonstrators with no group affiliation; the National Lawyers Guild; organizations and individuals associated with the women's rights movement; nationalist groups such as those seeking independence for Puerto Rico, United Ireland, and Cuban exile movements including Orlando Bosch's Cuban Power and the Cuban Nationalist Movement. The remaining 15% of COINTELPRO resources were expended to marginalize and subvert white hate groups, including the Ku Klux Klan and the National States' Rights Party. Files on Puerto Rican independence advocates The FBI also spied upon and collected information on Puerto Rican independence leader Pedro Albizu Campos and his Nationalist political party in the 1930s. Abizu Campos was convicted three times in connection with deadly attacks on US government officials: in 1937 (Conspiracy to overthrow the government of the United States), in 1950 (attempted murder), and in 1954 (after an armed assault on the US House of Representatives while in session; although not present, Abizu Campos was considered the mastermind).American National Biography, Pedro Abizu Campos , accessed April 19, 2015.

The documents available are as recent as 1965. Activities in Latin America From the 1950s to the 1980s, the governments of many Latin American and Caribbean countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico and others were infiltrated by the FBI.Che Guevara and the FBI: U.S. Political Police Dossier on the Latin American Revolutionary.

These operations began in World War II as 700 agents were assigned to monitor Nazi activity, but soon expanded to monitoring communist activity in places like Ecuador. Viola Liuzzo In one particularly controversial 1965 incident, white civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo was murdered by Ku Klux Klansmen, who gave chase and fired shots into her car after noticing that her passenger was a young black man; one of the Klansmen was Gary Thomas Rowe, an acknowledged FBI informant.Gary May, The Informant: The FBI, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Murder of Viola Luzzo, Yale University Press, 2005.

Edgar Hoover personally communicated these insinuations to President Johnson. 1996 campaign finance controversy The U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the fund-raising activities had uncovered evidence that Chinese agents sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) before the 1996 presidential campaign. The Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. was used for coordinating contributions to the DNC.Woodward, Bob and Duffy, Brian, \\"Chinese Embassy Role In Contributions Probed\\", Washington Post, February 13, 1997 In addition to partisan complaints from Republicans, number of FBI agents suggested the investigations into the fund-raising controversies were willfully impeded.Krauthammer, Charles, \\"Reno's Humiliation\\" (Opinion), Washington Post, October 10, 1997Safire, William, \\"Those Chinese Agents\\" (Opinion), New York Times, October 7, 1999Kondracke, Morton, \\"GOP must launch new probe of Chinagate\\" (Opinion), Jewish World Review, August 9, 1999 FBI agent Ivian Smith wrote a letter to FBI Director Louis Freeh that expressed \\"a lack of confidence\\" in the Justice Department's attorneys regarding the fund-raising investigation. FBI agent Daniel Wehr told Congress that the first head U.S. attorney in the investigation, Laura Ingersoll, told the agents they should \\"not pursue any matter related to solicitation of funds for access to the president. The reason given was, 'That's the way the American political process works.' I was scandalized by that,\\" Wehr said.

As a result, the Bureau largely ignored his organization in exchange for information about the inner workings of the Italian American Patriarca crime family. In December 1994, after being tipped off by his former FBI handler about a pending indictment under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, Bulger fled Boston and went into hiding. For 16 years, he remained at large. For 12 of those years, Bulger was prominently listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. Beginning in 1997, the New England media exposed criminal actions by federal, state, and local law enforcement officials tied to Bulger. The revelation caused great embarrassment to the FBI.\\"Capture Of Boston Gangster Could Mean More Scandal\\" NPR. In 2002, Special Agent John J Connolly was convicted of federal racketeering charges for helping Bulger avoid arrest. In 2008, Special Agent Connolly completed his term on the federal charges and was transferred to Florida where he was convicted of helping plan the murder of John B Callahan, a Bulger rival.

Death of Filiberto Ojeda Rios Puerto Rican Nationalist leader Filiberto Ojeda R√≠os died in a gun battle with FBI agents in 2005. In 2005, fugitive Puerto Rican Nationalist leader Filiberto Ojeda R√≠os died in a gun battle with FBI agents that some charged was an assassination. Puerto Rico Governor An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√° criticized the FBI assault as \\"improper\\" and \\"highly irregular\\" and demanded to know why his government was not informed of it. The FBI refused to release information beyond the official press release, citing security and agent privacy issues. The Puerto Rico Justice Department filed suit in federal court against the FBI and the US Attorney General, demanding information crucial to the Commonwealth's own investigation of the incident. The case was dismissed by the U.S Supreme Court. Ojeda Rios' funeral was attended by a long list of dignitaries, including the highest authority of the Roman Catholic Church in Puerto Rico, Archbishop Roberto Octavio Gonz√°lez Nieves, ex-Governor Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n, and numerous other personalities.Funeral Service for Filiberto Ojeda R√≠os Retrieved July 20, 2009.

Associated Press impersonation case In 2007, an agent working in Seattle, Washington for the FBI impersonated an Associated Press (AP) journalist and unwittingly infected the computer of a 15-year old suspect with a malicious surveillance software. The incident sparked a strongly-worded statement from the AP demanding the bureau refrain from ever impersonating a member of the news media again. Moreover, in September 2016 the incident resulted in a condemnation by the Justice Department. In December 2017, following a US court appearance, a judge ruled in favor of the AP in a lawsuit against the FBI for fraudulently impersonating a member of the news media. Wikipedia edits In August 2007, Virgil Griffith, a Caltech computation and neural-systems graduate student, created WikiScanner, a searchable database that linked changes made by anonymous Wikipedia editors to companies and organizations from which the changes were made. The database cross-referenced logs of Wikipedia edits with publicly available records pertaining to the Internet IP addresses edits were made from. Griffith was motivated by the edits from the United States Congress, and wanted to see if others were similarly promoting themselves. The tool was designed to detect conflict of interest edits. Among his findings were that FBI computers were used to edit the FBI article on Wikipedia. Although the edits correlated with known FBI IP addresses, there was no evidence that the changes actually came from a member or employee of the FBI, only that someone who had access to their network had edited the FBI article on Wikipedia. Wikipedia spokespersons received Griffith's \\"WikiScanner\\" positively, noting that it helped prevent conflicts of interest from influencing articles as well as increasing transparency and mitigating attempts to remove or distort relevant facts. Florida school shooting On February 16, 2018, two days after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, the FBI released a statement detailing information the organization's Public Access Line had received a month prior, on January 5, from a person close to Nikolas Cruz, the suspected shooter. According to the statement, \\"The caller provided information about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.\\" After conducting an investigation, the FBI reported that it had not followed protocol when the tip was not forwarded to the Miami Field Office, where further investigative steps would have been taken to prevent the mass killing. Hillary Clinton email investigation On July 5, 2016, FBI Director Comey announced the bureau's recommendation that the United States Department of Justice file no criminal charges relating to the Hillary Clinton email controversy. During an unusual 15 minute press conference in the J. Edgar Hoover Building, Comey called Secretary Clinton's and her top aides' behavior \\"extremely careless\\", but concluded that \\"no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case\\". On October 28, 2016, less than two weeks before the presidential election, Director Comey, a long-time Republican, announced in a letter to Congress that additional emails potentially related to the Clinton email controversy had been found and that the FBI will investigate \\"to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\\" At the time Comey sent his letter to Congress, the FBI had still not obtained a warrant to review any of the e-mails in question and was not aware of the content of any of the e-mails in question. After Comey's letter to Congress, commentator Paul Callan of CNN and Niall O'Dowd of Irish Central compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover in attempting to influence and manipulate elections. On November 6, 2016, in the face of constant pressure from both Republicans and Democrats, Comey conceded in a second letter to Congress that through the FBI's review of the new e-mails, there was no wrongdoing by Clinton. On November 12, 2016, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton directly attributed her election loss to FBI Director James Comey.\\"US election: Hillary Clinton blames loss on FBI's James Comey in call with top donors \\" = DOJ Watchdog Report = DOJ Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz On June 14, 2018, Michael E. Horowitz, the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, released a report of a year-long investigation into misconduct at the DOJ and FBI over its probe of Hillary Clinton's private email server. Horowitz faulted James Comey, FBI Director at the time of the email server investigation, for deviating from bureau and Justice Department protocol, which damaged the agencies‚Äô image of impartiality, according to the watchdog report. Comey was also faulted for a 'troubling lack of direct or substantive communication' with Attorney General Loretta Lynch ahead of his July 5, 2016 press conference on Clinton's email probe and his subsequent letter to Congress in October 2016. The report read: \\"We found it extraordinary that, in advance of two such consequential decisions, the FBI director decided that the best course of conduct was to not speak directly and substantively with the attorney general about how best to navigate those decisions.\\" Moreover, it was determined, according to an internal FBI email and a memo from two GOP-led House committees, that foreign actors may had obtained access to Clinton's emails, including at least one email classified as \\"secret.\\" The memo did not specify who the foreign actors involved were nor the content of the emails. The watchdog probe found no evidence of political bias or criminal misconduct in Comey's decisions throughout the entire email server investigation. \\"We found no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations,\\" the report stated. Shortly after the release of the report, FBI Director Christopher Wray held a news briefing in Washington where he defended the bureau's integrity over the report's highly-critical findings, but vowed to hold agents accountable for any misconduct and said the FBI will make its employees undergo bias training. Former Secretary of State Clinton, President Trump, lawmakers, and academics have commented on the report's findings, denouncing Comey and his breach of bureau norms, and five FBI employees that exchanged questionable text messages leading up to the 2016 US election. All five employees, which include former counter-intelligence agent Peter Strzok, were referred by Horowitz for a separate investigation. James Comey dismissal, IG probe = Dismissal of Comey = On May 9, 2017, President Trump dismissed FBI Director Comey after Comey had misstated several key findings of the email investigation in his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many mainstream news outlets had questioned whether the dismissal was in response to Comey's request for more resources to expand the probe into Russian interference into the Presidential election. Following Comey's dismissal, Deputy Director Andrew G. McCabe became Acting Director.New York Times, May 9, 2017, F.B.I. Director James Comey Is Fired by Trump On August 1, 2017, President Trump's nominee for FBI director Christopher A. Wray was officially confirmed by the Senate in a 92‚Äì5 vote and was sworn in as Director the next day. = Horowitz's Findings = The Inspector General of the Department of Justice, Michael E. Horowitz, publicized a report into misconduct at the DOJ and FBI over its handling of the Hillary Clinton private email server investigation. Horowitz criticized James Comey, FBI Director at the time of the investigation, for not following bureau and Justice Department protocol. The IG report, however, did not find any evidence of political bias or criminal misconduct in Comey's decisions throughout the email server investigation. According to the report, Horowitz found that Comey had a 'troubling lack of direct or substantive communication' with Attorney General Loretta Lynch ahead of his July 5, 2016 press conference on Clinton's email probe and his letter to Congress in October 2016. \\"We found it extraordinary that, in advance of two such consequential decisions, the FBI director decided that the best course of conduct was to not speak directly and substantively with the attorney general about how best to navigate those decisions,\\" according to the IG findings. Moreover, the report also uncovered the use of a private Gmail account for FBI business utilized by Comey, despite warning employees about its usage. The act of misconduct was \\"inconsistent with\\" Justice Department policy, the watchdog investigation determined. =The Nunes memo, FISA warrant= On February 2, 2018, a four-page confidential memo by Republican House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes was released after being signed by President Trump. According to the memo, a dossier by Christopher Steele and opposition research firm Fusion GPS was utilized by DOJ and FBI officials like E. W. Priestap for FISA warrants to surveil Trump's campaign member Carter Page. Additionally, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who resigned before the release of the memo, stated that the FISA warrant wouldn't have been obtained without the information in the Steele dossier. All four FISA applications were signed by McCabe, Rod Rosenstein, and former FBI Director James Comey. President Trump commented on the release of the memo, saying: \\"A lot of people should be ashamed.\\" =Andrew McCabe dismissal and investigation= Andrew G. McCabe On March 16, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired Andrew McCabe, former FBI deputy director, for allowing FBI officials to leak information to the media surrounding the Clinton Foundation investigation and then misleading investigators about the incident. The FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility recommended the firing two days prior. The allegations of misconduct were the result of an investigation by Michael E. Horowitz, the Inspector General specific to the DOJ appointed by former US President Barack Obama, who announced in January 2017 that the DOJ would be probing the FBI's actions leading up to the 2016 US election. On March 21, 2018, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the firing of McCabe was done \\"by the book\\" and was not politically motivated. On June 12, 2018, a lawyer representing McCabe sued the Department of Justice and the FBI pertaining to his firing. On September 6, 2018, it was disclosed to the media that a grand jury had begun investigating McCabe and summoning witnesses to determine if criminal charges should be filed for having misled the bureau. The probe is currently being handled by the U.S. attorney's office in D.C.. This also caused McCabe to drop his wrongful termination lawsuit. OIG Investigation On April 13, 2018, a section regarding McCabe from the Department of Justice watchdog report was released to the public. According to the report, McCabe \\"lacked candor,\\" including under oath, and authorized disclosures to the media in violation of FBI policy during a federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation. On April 19, 2018, the Justice Department inspector general had referred the findings of McCabe's misconduct to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C. for possible criminal charges, according to media reports. McCabe has denied the accusations of misconduct. Allegations of sexual discrimination In late-2017, during an interview with Circa, former FBI Supervisory special agent Jeffrey Danik spoke out against McCabe and the bureau over his handling of cases surrounding sexual discrimination, Hatch Act Violations, and Hillary Clinton's email server. Around the same period of time, another former Supervisory Special Agent, Robyn Gritz, one of the bureau's top intelligence analysts and terrorism experts, filed a sexual discrimination complaint against the bureau. Gritz came forward with allegations of harassment by McCabe, who she said created a ‚Äúcancer-like‚Äù bureaucracy striking fear in female agents, causing others to resign, and \\"poisoning the 7th floor,\\" where management is housed in the FBI's Hoover Building. In an additional case, where a federal lawsuit was filed, another agent came forward with allegations of harassment and misogynistic behavior against women in particular, describing an increasing problem of sexism at the bureau. =Peter Strzok's dismissal= On August 10, 2018, Peter Strzok, a former counter-intelligence agent reassigned to the FBI's Human Resources department, was fired by the Bureau amid tensions over his role in exchanging questionable text messages with another FBI employee, Lisa Page, with whom he was engaged in an extramarital affair..

The is an 18th century collection of depicting Japanese y≈çkai by poet and painter Yosa Buson. The whereabouts of the original work are presently unclear; its contents are known from a reprinting released by the Kitada Shisui Collection in 1928.

In total, eight different kinds of are depicted. Some of the works are annotated with just the name of the being portrayed, whereas others include a more detailed story. It has been surmised that, whilst Buson was travelling across Japan, he picked up various stories about different kinds of regional y≈çkai, and that the y≈çkai emaki contains his realisation of those stories. Buson, who excelled in the haiga-style, forsook realism, and instead painted his y≈çkai in a manner that uniquely resembles modern Japanese manga. Most traditional paintings of y≈çkai from Japan's mediaeval period (1185‚Äì1568) portrayed them as supernatural beings, the fearful harbingers of disaster, but works from the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868), including Buson's, paint them as familiar, funny, creatures that can be enjoyed as fiction. This trend continues in modern y≈çkai manga, which have their origins in Edo period works like Buson's.

Maltz combines in his works of art, abstract and narrated motifs. His work deals with documentation of humanistic, theological, and political aspects in the day to day. Biography Peter Jacob Maltz was born on 1973 in London, the son of Stephen and Susan Maltz. In 1977, he immigrated to Israel with his family. He was raised in Ramat Hasharon in a Traditional and English-speaking family. Since his childhood Maltz was intrigued with aspects of Identity, Religion and Faith. Those aspects found their way to his artistic work. As a teenager, Maltz studied art in \\"Alon\\" high school at Ramat Hasharon. His experiences as young man had an influence on his artistic path. Those experiences included his army service and his younger brother's death. Before his BFA studies Maltz learnt stone carving in south India and grew closer to Buddhism. He studied art at Bezalel art Academy in Jerusalem and was influenced by artists such as Larry Abramson, Nahum Tevet and Pesach Slabosky. While establishing a personal visual language during his studies, Maltz studied art education, researched the implications of the Post-Modern era, Strategies of documentation and worked as an exhibition producer at the Israel museum. In 2002 Maltz held his first Solo exhibition at the Artist's Studios in Tel Aviv. The foundations of his artists characteristics can be recognized from this exhibition. Use of variety Artistic styles, Bridging the personal with the communal, using art as a form of documentation, Drawing inspiration from Religious subjects and Literature and using irony and humor as means to convey complex messages. In 2005 Maltz completed his master's degree in sculpture at the Royal College of Art, London.Rubens' masterpiece inspires student's junk 'Massacre' At the graduation show he exhibited a large relief and a series of drawings. This exhibition set the foundations of an ongoing preoccupation with reliefs that aspire to bridge the physical space to metaphysical sensations. It was also the basis of creating series of drawings to depict an allegorical narrative. From this year on, Maltz perceives his creative activity as a holistic documentary project. A sequence of moments that create a single chronicle. In 2006 he began his social activity. He created artistic projects with children in Jaffa and Ofakim. In 2011, Maltz published the book \\"Roots\\", in it appeared ink drawing that accompanied the text. The book tells the story of David, a lecturer at Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem. David descends from Jerusalem towards Tel Aviv after his day of work. His car breaks down near the village of Shoresh. While he waits for the towing, he decides to climb Mount Shoresh, where he meets the figure of Jacob. Jacob preaches his views on faith and existence to David and tells him that he was educated as a \\"New Essenes\\". Following this encounter, David undergoes a change and returns to his life. The drawings in the books were inspired by the works of Ephraim Moshe Lilien that were combined with photographs taken by Maltz in Jerusalem and in the \\"Sha'ar Hagai\\" valley. This book is an interim summary and culmination of Maltz's work on the topic of Allegorical journey's. In the book ideas relating to his personal life, religious Fundamentalism, faith and art, New Age, Jerusalem and neo-Zionism were intertwined. In January 2012 he created the project \\" Undercurrent\\". Maltz created a drawing a day and uploaded it to Facebook. The drawings responded to his personal life, to the Israeli art field and to the Israeli reality. The drawings were exhibited at Kibbutz Gallery in 2013. In 2015, Maltz created a large-sized relief, \\"One Day Passes and Another Day Comes \\", which is exhibited at the Israel Museum. For the preparation of the relief, Maltz went on a ten-day journey from his home in Kadima to the specified exhibition wall at the Israel Museum. On his way, he created multiple imprints of textures and objects using clay from which he prepared casts. After the journey he connected all the casts to sixteen panels which were then hung on a wall to create one work. The work depicts a road map and a compression of the journey that occurred over space and time to one place and time ‚Äì the wall in the museum.

The film, written and directed by Zeek Earl and Chris Caldwell, features a teenage girl and her father traveling to an alien moon with a contract to mine gems in the moon's poisonous forest. On the moon, the father is driven by greed, and the two encounter dangerous strangers in the forest. The film premiered on March 5, 2018 at the South by Southwest Film Festival. The company , under their science fiction-oriented label Dust, released the film in Regal Cinemas theaters on November 2, 2018, and on video- on-demand and home media on March 8, 2019.  Plot  The teenage girl Cee and her father Damon descend in a landing pod from their spaceship to the surface of a forest moon covered in poisonous spores to mine for gems. They suffer a technical malfunction during the descent which cripples the lander and the pair touch down some distance away from their planned prospecting site. The pair begins traveling to the site by foot and comes across an abandoned dig site. Damon and Cee extract a fleshy pod from the earth and carefully dissect it to reveal a valuable gem. Cee implores her father to take this gem and return to the lander, but Damon insists they continue to the original landing site. The pair sets out again, and Damon is approached by two rival prospectors: Ezra and his silent companion. Ezra and his partner attempt to rob Damon, but he suggests instead that they join forces. Damon explains that he has been contacted to assist a group of mercenaries who stumbled upon the legendary 'queen's lair', a dig site of extraordinary value. Damon suggests that rather than digging for the mercenaries, Ezra, his companion, and Damon can join forces and take the entire dig for themselves. Ezra agrees, but Cee, who has been hiding throughout this encounter, ambushes the two hostile prospectors with a rifle, allowing Damon to wrest a weapon from Ezra and take both Ezra and his partner hostage. Damon proceeds to rob Ezra which triggers a firefight, killing Damon and Ezra's partner. Cee flees back to her damaged lander, which fails to start. She has been followed by Ezra. When Ezra attempts to enter, Cee wounds him in the arm with her rifle and takes him prisoner. Ezra suggests that they follow Damon's original plan and aid the mercenaries in exchange for passage on the mercenaries' ship. Cee agrees, and the pair sets out for the queen's lair. Ezra's wound has become infected by the poisonous spores in the atmosphere, and so the pair approaches a group of human villagers with the intent to trade for medical treatment. The villagers instead offer a trade of gems in exchange for Cee. As Ezra asks about details of the offer, Cee flees the village and escapes pursuit by the villagers. After wandering the planet alone, Cee runs into Ezra once again. His wound has worsened considerably, and Cee helps him amputate his arm. The pair set out once more and soon arrives at the mercenary camp surrounding the queen's lair. After negotiating passage on the mercenaries' ship, Cee and Ezra attempt to fulfill their end of the contract and extract gems from the queen's lair. They fail several extraction attempts, and as their mercenary guard turns to report their failure, Ezra attacks and kills him. The commotion attracts the rest of the mercenaries, and a fight ensues. Several mercenaries are killed, and Ezra is gravely wounded. Cee tends to Ezra's wound, and the pair escape into orbit on the mercenaries' ship.

The film was released on video-on-demand and home media on March 8, 2019. * Critical reception The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes assessed 48 reviews; it reported 42 as positive and 6 as negative, for an overall rating of 88%. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Fueled by character development and setting instead of special effects, Prospect is a sci-fi story whose style is defined‚Äîand enriched‚Äîby its limitations.\\" The similar website Metacritic assessed 8 reviews and reported 6 as positive and 2 as mixed. With an overall score of 68 out of 100, it said the film had \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Peter Debruge of Variety wrote, \\"Constructing character does not appear to be Earl and Caldwell‚Äôs strong suit (what‚Äôs satisfying about Cee owes almost entirely to Thatcher, a fresh face who tricks us into assuming she‚Äôs just a callow teen, when in fact, she proves to be the film‚Äôs toughest character). On the other hand, the duo show a real aptitude for world building.\\" References External links * Category:2018 science fiction films Category:2018 films Category:American science fiction films Category:American films Category:Films set on fictional moons Category:Space Western films ","title":"Prospect (film)"},{"id":"58544325","text":"The PWBA Players Championship is one of the four major tournaments on the Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA) Tour.

When the PWBA Tour was renewed in 2015, the tournament was not part of that year's schedule, but has been brought back as the PWBA Players Championship for every subsequent season since.PWBA Past Champions The current tournament is contested over five rounds. All participants bowl two nine-game rounds of qualifying, with the field then cut to the top 18. These 18 players bowl two nine-game rounds of match play (17 round-robin head-to-head matches, followed by a position round match). Bowlers receive their scratch score for every game of match play, plus 30 bonus pins for winning a match. In the case of a tie, players receive 15 bonus pins each.

Between eighty to one hundred examples of it and an improved variant, the CWJ-bis Skaut, were built. Design and development ZASPL, the Aviation Association of students of the Lw√≥w Technical University, was the oldest aviation organization in Poland. Revived after World War I, by 1926 it had workshops in Lw√≥w which began building the glider designs of ZASPL member Wac≈Çaw Czerwi≈Ñski. The successful Czerwi≈Ñski CW III, a 1929 open frame introductory glider, had shown the utility of the type for basic training but it was expensive and ready for development. In response, Czerwi≈Ñski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jarworski designed the CWJ (a fusion of their initials) to fill the national gliding clubs' needs. The fuselage of the CWJ was essentially an uncovered pine Warren girder, though the rear part of the lower longeron or chord was upward-curved. The unprotected pilot's seat was forward of the wing on a pine fuselage box which reached back to about mid fuselage. The box also carried twin sprung landing skids. The CWJ's two part, twin spar wing was rectangular in plan. Mounted on the upper fuselage longeron, it was wire braced from above via an inverted-V cabane and from below to the lower longeron. Short ailerons reached the tips. At the rear a broad fin occupied the gap between the upper and lower longerons and had a short, triangular extension above. An almost rectangular rudder ran upwards from the bottom of the fin, extending well above it. The tailplane, mounted on the upper longeron, was triangular in plan. It carried elevators which were rectangular apart from cut-outs for rudder movement. The CWJ first flew in October 1931, tow-launched by a car. An improved version, the CWJ-bis Skaut (Scout) made its first flight on 3 August 1933 at Czerwony Kamie≈Ñ, the base of the Lw√≥w Aeroclub Gliding School. It had a wing increased in span by , a corresponding 11% increase in wing area and had washout at the wingtips which improved aileron response. The wire wing bracing of the CWJ was replaced by pairs of parallel struts and the fuselage box was strengthened. The empennage was also modified; the fin now had a triangular, rather than straight, leading edge and at some later time the top of the rudder was made almost semi-circular. Early tests showed the sought-after improvement in handling. Operational history Shortly after its successful early tests, early orders from both the government and LOPP took the CWJ into production. Design drawings were also produced for amateur builders and some parts and materials were made available from ZAPL. According to Cynk about eighty examples of the CWJ and CWJ-bis were built in all, including about twenty of the latter, though samalotypolskie.pl says that there were one hundred altogether, eighty of them CWJs. They were used by clubs across Poland and were easy to transport, tough, could be car- launched and were stable in flight though with limited performance. By about 1938 both variants had been retired, displaced by the newer, better performing Kocjan Czajka and Kocjan Wrona. Variants ;CWJ: 1931 aircraft. Production estimates are about sixty or eighty. ;CWJ-bis Skaut: 1933 improved model with washout for better aileron control. The fuselage box was strengthened and the vertical tail modified. A few had ply-covered cockpits. Production estimates are about twenty.

The minor planet 776 Berbericia was named in his honour.  Early life  Adolf Berberich was born on 16 November 1861 in √úberlingen, Baden, to Katharina Hirt and Michael, a postman in Rastatt. From 1871 ‚Äì 1880 he attended a gymnasium in Rastatt and then went on to study astronomy at the University of Strasbourg until 1884, during which his family reportedly encountered serious financial difficulties. During his time there, he found himself unsatisfied by the insufficient funding for astronomy, which he blamed partly on Friedrich Winnecke and Wilhelm Schur, who headed the astronomy department and directed the Strasbourg observatory. The Strasbourg observatory in 2009Berberich originally planned to devote himself to the study of observational astronomy, but severe myopia, or near-sightedness, forced him to turn to theoretical astronomy.  Career  Berberich's proficiency at making calculations was quickly noticed by the astronomy community, with his long- time friend Fritz Cohn noting his \\"infallible dexterity in arithmetic.\\" In October 1884 he was inducted, as a part-time staff member, into the Astronomical Calculation Institute (ACI), of which Cohn would later become the director. On 1 April 1897, he attained a permanent position at the institute and by December 1903 he was a professor. Initially, Berberich split his time at the institute between assisting in the production of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch (BAJ) ephemeris and calculating the orbits of comets, with a calculation of his first appearing in Volume 117 of the BAJ. He went on to spend 35 years working on the BAJ and at one point was its director. He quickly became engrossed in the study of minor planets and devoted as much of his office hours as he could to it, as well as frequently continuing his work at home. He published numerous papers detailing methods by which to predict and calculate the movement of astronomical objects and was instrumental in devising the basic principles by which to predict meteor showers. As the number of minor planets grew rapidly, the ACI began to discuss prioritising other less daunting research, but Berberich persuaded the institute to continue their work. His influence within the ACI expanded until, eventually, he oversaw or managed many of the institute's projects. From 1883 ‚Äì 1905 he edited the astrophysics section of the Fortschritte der Physik journal published by the German Physical Society. Following the unexpected death of Walter Wislicenus in 1905, Berberich continued to edit and publish the Astronomischer Jahresbericht journal with the help of the ACI. Even with the growing workload, he continued to calculate orbits, albeit at a slower rate. When Fritz Cohn became the director of the ACI in 1909 he found Berberich to be \\"overworked on the fringes of his forces\\" and gave him a holiday, which he spent catching up on research into the minor planets. Berberich enjoyed great recognition and respect both among his local colleagues and internationally, with the French Academy of Sciences awarding him the Valz Prize in 1893 and the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Wroc≈Çaw making him an honorary doctorate in 1911. His close friend and colleague Max Wolf said the following of Berberich and another close friend and colleague, Johann Palisa: In the final half of his last year, Berberich fell extremely ill and could no longer make the considerable journey to the institute. Nevertheless, he continued to work from home and sent valuable calculations up until the final weeks of his life, during which he took an extended vacation. On the night of 23 April 1920, Berberich suffered a stroke. He failed to recover and died in the morning hours of 27 April in Berlin. Fritz Cohn described the numbers of attendance at his funeral procession as \\"countless.\\"  Personal life  Berberich was a generally reserved character. He spent most of his time alone and only married in the last year of his life. His two closest friends were observational astronomers Max Wolf, who named a minor planet in Berberich's honour, and Johann Palisa, for whom Wolf also named a minor planet. Unbeknownst to most of his colleagues and friends until after his death, Berberich was a devout Catholic and was active in the Tempelhof Catholic community, especially as a benefactor and adviser to the poor.

He is related to a Scythian deity of the same name. His name is possibly derived from \\"don\\", meaning river, derived from \\"danu\\", meaning to flow, as a prefix for the name Peter, which becomes \\"Bettyr\\". He is the Ossetian equivalent of the Greek Poseidon. His beautiful daughters are the Ossetian equivalent of sea nymphs. Through them, he is the ancestor of many of the heroes of the epic Nart saga of the north Caucasus, including Uryzmaeg, Satanaya, Xaemyts, and Batraz.  Relations  Donbettyr's golden-haired daughter Dzerassae was the mother of Uryzmaeg, Satanaya, and Xaemyts. Donbettyr is also the maternal grandfather of the Nart hero Batraz, through the marriage of the hunter Xaemyts to an unnamed daughter of Donbettyr. In the story of their marriage, Xaemyts is chasing a white rabbit and shooting at it. It dies, but returns to life three times, before escaping to the coast where it dives into the sea. Donbettyr rises from the water and declares that the hare was actually his daughter and that Xaemyts must marry her. Xaemyts agrees, only to be told that his wife will appear on earth during the day in the form of a tortoise. Only at night will she take the form of the beautiful woman he married. When Uryzmaeg had a son, Donbettyr took it upon himself to raise the boy, deep beneath the sea. While sometimes this boy is nameless, in some versions he is the Caucasian culture hero Amirani. Generally raised on land, in this Ossetic variation, Amirani is thrown into the sea and raised by Donbettyr and his daughters, eventually rising from the sea on the back of a bull.

Production of the 14/60 continued until 1931. As well as the standard car there were variants called the 2 Litre Speed (1927‚Äì33) and Continental (1932 only). The first part of its name referred to its Fiscal horsepower rating of 14 (actually 12.9) and the second part the engine output in bhp. According to the Lagonda Club, around 1440 cars were made. Engine and transmission The engine was a new design for the car by Arthur Davidson who had been with Lea- Francis. The 4 cylinder, 1954 cc unit was notable for its valve gear. Two camshafts were mounted high on each side of the engine block and operated the overhead valves via rockers mounted in the head that had fingers that followed the camshafts. This allowed the cylinder head, which unlike previous Lagondas was detachable, with its hemi-spherical combustion chambers to be removed without disturbing the valve timing. The camshafts were driven by a two-stage chain arrangement, the first chain also drove the dynamo, oil and water pumps. The crankshaft was carried in five main bearings. A single Zenith carburettor was fitted. With a bore of 72mm and stroke of 120mm the engine was said to produce 60bhp at 3500rpm. The four-speed gearbox was separate from the engine and driven through a single dry-plate clutch. An open shaft then went to the spiral-bevel rear axle. Chassis and suspension The chassis design was by A. E. Masters and consisted of side members held apart by a combination of tubular and channed cross members. Semi-elliptical leaf springs were fitted front and rear. drum brakes operated by rods and cables were fitted on all four wheels with separate shoes in the rear brakes for the handbrake. Coachwork Three standard body styles were available for the 14/60, a saloon, a tourer and an open semi-sports with V-shaped windscreen. The saloon and tourer were designed to accommodate five people but the slightly narrower sports only four. Early cars were fitted with steel artillery type wheels but later cars had wire wheels. Some chassis went to external coachbulders. 2 Litre Speed Model In 1927 the Speed model was announced. The engine was tuned to give 70 bhp by raising the compression ratio and with a lighter body was guaranteed to reach . The chassis was modified to allow the engine to be mounted further back giving a much longer bonnet. Standard bodies were a tourer or fabric saloon. For 1929 the chassis was further modified and has become known as the \\"low-chassis\\" version. The radiator was also altered as the dynamo was moved to the front of the crankshaft. A supercharged version was announced in 1930 said to be capable of . Continental Continental model with the large Lucas headlamps In 1932 a new model was announced called the Continental. Its tourer body was made of steel and the radiator was inclined slightly and had thermostatic shutters. Cycle type front wings were fitted and there were large Lucas P100 headlamps. The car cost an extra GBP30 and 23 were made. References 14 60 Category:Cars introduced in 1925 ","title":"Lagonda 14/60"},{"id":"58544715","text":"Kevin L.

On October 4, 1927, the band was allocated on a worldwide basis by the International Radiotelegraph Conference in Washington, D.C. 56‚Äì60 MHz was allocated for amateur and experimental use. At the 1938 International Radiocommunication Conference in Cairo, television broadcasting was given priority in a portion of the 5- and 6-meter band in Europe. Television and low power stations, meaning those with less than 1 kW power, were allocated 56‚Äì58.5 MHz and amateurs, experimenters and low power stations were allocated 58.5‚Äì60 MHz in the European region. The conference maintained the 56‚Äì60 MHz allocation for other regions and allowed administrations in Europe latitude to allow amateurs to continue using 56‚Äì58.5 MHz. In 1940, television channel 2 was reallocated to 60 MHz and TV channel 1 was moved to 50‚Äì56 MHz maintaining a gap for the 5-meter amateur band. When the US entered World War II, transmissions by amateur radio stations were suspended for the duration of the war. After the war, the 5-meter band was briefly reopened to amateurs from 56‚Äì60 MHz until March 1, 1946.

The club enters teams in the Men's Irish Hockey League, the Irish Senior Cup and the Irish Junior Cup. Glenanne has represented Ireland in European competitions. They won the 2008 EuroHockey Club Trophy and were European Cup Winners' Cup runners up in 2002. Club History =Early years= The club was originally the staff sports association of the Brown Thomas department store based on Grafton Street and was originally known as the Graftonians. In 1943 when Graftonians became an open club, the club was reformed as Glenanne Sports Club. In addition to playing field hockey, in its early decades the club also had active table tennis, golf and tennis sections. =Golden era= Glenanne had to wait until 1985 before their men's section won their first senior trophy, the Neville Cup. In 1996 they won the Leinster Senior Cup for the first time. Glenanne won their first Leinster Division One title in April 2000 which was followed weeks later by their first All-Ireland Club Championship win. This marked the beginning of golden era for the club. During the 2000s they won a further five Leinster Division One titles, three Irish Senior Cups and four Leinster Senior Cups. They also won the 2008 EuroHockey Club Trophy and were European Cup Winners' Cup runners up in 2002. During this era the club's players included Ireland internationals Graham Shaw and Stephen Butler. Towards the end of the decade Glenanne teams also featured Shane O'Donoghue. =75th anniversary= In 2018 Glenanne celebrated their 75th anniversary by winning a national double. In 2017‚Äì18 they won the Men's Irish Hockey League title for the first time. They secured the title after defeating Lisnagarvey 4‚Äì2. Glenanne were 2‚Äì0 down before Shane O'Donoghue scored a hat-trick. Meanwhile, Glenanne's men's reserve team also won the Irish Junior Cup after defeating Pembroke Wanderers 3‚Äì2 in the final. =Glenanne in Europe= Glenanne has represented Ireland in Europe on several occasions. After winning the 2001 Irish Senior Cup, they qualified for the 2002 European Cup Winners' Cup hosted in Gibraltar. They reached the final of the tournament and finished as runners up after they were defeated in the final by Atl√®tic Terrassa. Glenanne won the 2008 EuroHockey Club Trophy in Paris after an defeating the host team, CA Montrouge, in the final after extra-time. They subsequently played in the 2009‚Äì10 and the 2010‚Äì11 Euro Hockey Leagues. Women's section Glenanne has also organised women's field hockey teams. In 1970, following the loss of their original home at Fortfield Road, the original ladies section was disbanded. However, in 1975 it was reformed. The Glenanne women have won the Irish Junior Cup in 1984 and 2008. In the 2008 final they defeated Railway Union 5‚Äì1. Prominent Glenanne women's players have included Mary Waldron and Nicola Daly. Waldron was a dual international who played for both the Republic of Ireland women's national football team and the Ireland women's cricket team. Daly was a member of the silver medal winning Ireland squad at the 2018 Women's Hockey World Cup. Another Ireland international, Nikki Symmons, has also coached the women's team. Grounds Glenanne were originally based on Fortfield Road in Terenure. The club was named after St. Anne's, a local big house where the club played. The River Poddle also ran near the ground, creating a Glen like appearance. In 1958 the club installed floodlights. They were one of the first field hockey clubs in Ireland to do so. In 1970 the club lost its original grounds after the land was sold for building. Between 1970 and 1985 Tallaght Community School served as the club home. They also used a pitch at Londonbridge Road and a pitch in Templeogue which belonged to the Leinster Branch of the Irish Hockey Union. In 1985 Glenanne began renting the all- weather pitch at St Mark's Community School. The club gradually moved there, eventually abandoning the pitch in Tallaght Community School. In 1989 the club made an arrangement with the trustees of St Mark's Community School and the Department of Education which saw Glenanne lease a site from the school, build Glenanne Park and give the school permission to use the grounds during school time. Glenanne Park was officially opened by the President of Ireland, Mary Robinson on 21 April 1991. In 2001‚Äì02 Glenanne Park was upgraded and the arrangement with the school was extended. In 2017‚Äì18 the men's senior team began to play their home games at St. Andrew's College. Glenanne is currently undergoing a further pitch replacement programme 2018/2019.

He was considered the pioneer naturalist of the Southwest, studying the mammals and birds of California, Arizona, and Baja California. His personal specimen collection of 2,000 birds and mammals, donated in 1910, was the foundation of the San Diego Natural History Museum's Birds & Mammals Department, now a major resource on bird and mammal species of western North America, including Baja California. Biography Born on April 2, 1849 near Portage in Livingston County, New York, Frank Stephens was the eldest of the four sons of Nelson and Julia (n√©e Preston) Benson. During his early years, the family moved to the Midwest, farming in Michigan, Illinois, Missouri and Kansas. An interest in wildlife led him at age 22 to take some lessons in taxidermy. At age 24, he married Elizabeth Fowler, and in 1874 the couple moved to Colorado, where he studied taxidermy with ornithologist Charles E. Aiken. Moving to California in 1876, he settled in Witch Creek, San Diego County, California, where he farmed and continued collecting, working regularly for the U. S. Biological Survey and the University of California's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ). In the early 1880s, Stephens collected in southwest New Mexico and Arizona for Aikens and for William Brewster (ornithologist) of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology. He collected for Donald Ryder Dickey and C. Hart Merriam, among others. He was a collector for the U. S. Biological Survey's 1891 Death Valley Expedition. Stephens's wife Elizabeth died in January 1898, and he married Kate Brown in August 1898. She accompanied him on several collecting trips, including the 1907 expedition to southeastern Alaska sponsored by Annie Montague Alexander. In her own right, Kate Stephens became an authority on shells. Stephens was active both in the field and the study throughout his 60-year career. He participated in Joseph Grinnell's 1910 MVZ expedition on the Colorado River and continued camping out on collecting trips into his 70s. He was a frequent contributor to The Condor, founded the San Diego Society of Natural History's scientific journal, Transactions, and in 1906 self-published his major work, California Mammals (illustrated by W. J. Fenn). Stephens was an early member of the San Diego Society of Natural History and the first curator of mammalogy for the San Diego Natural History Museum; he was also a founding member of the San Diego Zoological Society. He is credited with collecting at least 45 type specimens. Death Although he had faced difficult conditions on many desert treks, Stephens was felled in the city by modern technology: crossing a street in San Diego, he was struck by a street car on September 25, 1937 and died ten days after the accident on October 5, 1937 at Mercy Hospital in San Diego.

In 1991, founders David Hyde and Ralph Perella began franchising the restaurant under the name Buffalo's Franchise Concepts Inc. (BFCI) The company had 40 locations by 1998. In 2001, the chain was renamed Buffalo's Southwest Cafe following the introduction of southwestern food. A location in Kuwait opened at the end of that year. In 2006, the company launched a fast casual restaurant known as Buffalo's Express. Later that year, Perella sold BFCI to Texas native Drew Alexander and his business partner Shelli Lang, a Las Vegas resident. In 2011, the chain had been renamed Buffalo's Cafe, and was sold to Fog Cutter Capital Group Inc., which also owned Fatburger. Fog Cutter Capital Group subsequently opened several co- branded Fatburger/Buffalo's Express locations. In 2017, ownership of the chain was transferred to FAT Brands, a subsidiary of Fog Cutter Capital Group. The chain has locations in North America, Asia, and the Middle East. History =Buffalo's Cafe (1985‚Äì2001)= A Buffalo's Cafe in Cartersville, Georgia Buffalo's Cafe was formed in 1985, by friends David Hyde and Ralph Perrella. They chose a western theme for their first restaurant, which was designed and built by Perella, who was a graduate of Georgia Tech and an architect with construction experience. According to Perella: \\"We wanted to make it look like it had been there for 30 years. We created a rustic d√©cor to capture the feel of an old Southwest caf√©, with rough wood floors, distressed metal ceilings, American antiques, artifacts, memorabilia and hundreds of period photographs lining the wooded walls.\\" Hyde and Perella opened their first Buffalo's Cafe in Roswell, Georgia, on October 26, 1985. The restaurant was named for its signature item: Buffalo-style chicken wings. By 1990, there were four Buffalo's Cafe locations operating in the metropolitan Atlanta area. Franchising began the following year, under the name Buffalo's Franchise Concepts Inc. (BFCI). In 1995, the Atlanta-based company had 35 restaurants, located in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Sixteen of its locations were in the metropolitan Atlanta area. By the end of 1995, the company planned a rapid expansion throughout the Southeast United States that would add 16 new franchised restaurants over the next 18 months, with a total of 100 locations expected in three years. In late 1997, Ray Cabana was named as BFCI's new president, director, and chief executive; he had previously served as chief executive and president of Johnny Rockets for four years before joining Buffalo's as a consultant in 1996. As of 1998, the chain had 40 restaurant locations. The company planned to have 100 locations by 2000, and signed development agreements for the Midwestern United States, as well as Indonesia and Egypt. The company opened its first restaurant in Puerto Rico in December 1998. In 2000 the chain launched a $1 million promotional campaign for its 46 restaurants. The campaign included a cowboy character used as a family-oriented spokesperson in radio and television commercials. =Buffalo's Southwest Cafe (2001‚Äì2011)= In May 2001, the Buffalo's Cafe name was changed to Buffalo's Southwest Cafe to reflect new southwestern food items added to the menu, while retaining Buffalo wings. Restaurant facilities were also updated to include a new design by Perella. The company opened a restaurant in Kuwait, in December 2001. In 2003, the company expanded to Indiana. At the end of 2003, the company announced plans to open its first Texas location in late 2004, in Houston. Texas was a major component of the company's expansion plan, and several sites in northwestern Houston were being evaluated. During 2006, the company launched Buffalo's Express, a fast casual restaurant concept. The company also began construction on a restaurant location in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. During 2006, the company also planned to add two new Nevada locations, in Pahrump * and Ely. The Pahrump location was proposed by Texas native Drew Alexander, along with business partner and Las Vegas resident Shelli Lang. The pair owned locations in Las Vegas and Mesquite, Nevada, and had been partners for 14 years, previously as franchisees for Hair Club for Men. Alexander became involved in the company three years earlier when he purchased a franchise territory in Nevada. In December 2006, Perella sold BFCI to Alexander and Lang. Under the new ownership, Alexander would become company president and chief operating officer; Lang would serve as vice president, secretary, and treasurer; and Perella would become a consultant. The sale included the new Buffalo's Express concept, which was to be expanded. The company would remain based in Marietta, while opening sales offices in Las Vegas. At the time, the chain had 38 restaurants, located in 10 states, Puerto Rico, and Kuwait; 34 locations were franchised and the other 4 were company-owned and located in Georgia. Because of the Great Recession, the company reduced some of its expansion plans. =Buffalo's Cafe (2011‚Äìpresent)= During 2011, the restaurant chain had reverted to its \\"Buffalo's Cafe\\" name. Fog Cutter Capital Group Inc., which owned Fatburger, announced in December 2011 that it had acquired Buffalo's Cafe and Buffalo's Express Cafe. At the time, the chain had 26 U.S. locations, in Georgia, Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, and Texas, as well as five locations in Kuwait and one in Riyadh. Fog Cutter Capital Group had been interested in the company because of its potential for growth in the Middle East. In 2012, Fog Cutter Capital Group opened a co-branded Fatburger/Buffalo's Express in Los Angeles, in part as a display for international franchisees. The co-branded location had a 33 percent increase over average revenues for standalone locations, which ignited interest among U.S. franchisees for additional Fatburger/Buffalo's Express locations. By September 2013, six co-branded locations had opened while an additional 36 were under development. In 2017, ownership of Fatburger and Buffalo's Cafe was transferred to FAT Brands, a wholly owned subsidiary formed by Fog Cutter Capital Group and based in Los Angeles. FAT Brands succeeded BFCI. Buffalo's Express expanded to Singapore in September 2018, with the opening of co- branded Fatburger restaurants. Buffalo's Cafe operates 14 restaurants in Georgia, as well as one in Riyadh and two in Doha, Qatar. There are 19 Fatburger/Buffalo's Express locations in California; 13 locations in Canada; two in the Philippines; and one each in Dubai and Malaysia. Buffalo's Sinkhole In August 2002, a Buffalo's Southwest Cafe in Hickory, North Carolina was closed after two sinkholes opened in the restaurant's parking lot following record rainfall. A Chevrolet Corvette fell into one of the sinkholes. The restaurant reopened in 2003, after nine months of repairs to remove the sinkholes. The restaurant owner believed that the sinkhole incident would increase business, but it did not, and the restaurant eventually closed in May 2004. The franchisee then sued the city, the North Carolina Department of Transportation, and the previous owners of the land over the issue of the sinkhole, which would become known as Buffalo's Sinkhole. A sinkhole opened again in the parking lot in July 2005, following Hurricane Cindy. The lawsuit was settled in 2007 and the restaurant was demolished later that year, while Buffalo's Sinkhole remained an issue as of 2016, posing a risk to the nearby Highway 70.

The cause was a material defect. * On January 7, a gas pipeline exploded near Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, killing a pipeline employee. * On February 1, a plumber trying to unclog a sewer line in St. Paul, Minnesota ruptured a gas service line that has been \\"cross bored\\" through the house's sewer line. The plumber and resident escaped the house moments before as an explosion and following fire destroyed the house. The Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety ordered that gas utility, Xcel, to check for more cross bored gas lines. In the following year, 25,000 sewer lines inspected showed 57 other cross bored gas lines. In Louisville, Kentucky, 430 gas line cross bores were found in of a sewer project, including some near schools and a hospital. The NTSB had cited such cross bore incidents as a known hazard since 1976. * On February 7, a power plant explosion occurred at the Kleen Energy Systems, killing 5 and injuring a dozen. * On February 25, a natural gas liquids (NGL) pipeline ruptured near Pond Creek, Oklahoma, releasing over of NGL's, and forcing road closures. There was no fire. * On March 1, at about 8:10 am, Mid- Valley Pipeline identified a release of crude oil in the manifold area of the Mid-Valley tank farm in Longview, Texas. Crude oil was observed \\"gushing\\" from the soil in the manifold area. About 198 barrels of crude oil were estimated to have been released and 196 barrels were recovered from the secondary containment area within Mid-Valley's site.Failure Investigation Report ‚Äì Mid- Valley Pipeline Internal Corrosion Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, November 7, 2011, accessed September 5, 2015, 31 pages * On March 2, 2010, Reno County 911 dispatch was notified about a natural gas leak in a 26-inch diameter interstate pipeline at Red Rock Road and Andre Road near Abbyville, Kansas. Twenty people were evacuated as a precaution. The leak was caused by a ruptured girth weld in the pipe owned by Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline. The pipe was manufactured in 1967.PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 2010-2017, PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident- flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. * On March 15, a 24-inch gas pipeline burst, but did not ignite near Pampa, Texas. * On March 25, there was a release of 1700 barrels of Vacuum gas oil (VGO) from the FM-1 pipeline into an open in-ground valve pit and the surrounding area in the West Yard of the Sunoco, R&M; Philadelphia refinery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The area was under the control of the Operator in a fenced off area that is off-limits to the public. * On April 5, a crude oil pipeline ruptured near Green River, Wyoming. At least of crude were spilled. Corrosion in the pipeline was the cause. * On April 13, a flash fire occurred as a result of incorrect operations while operator and contract employees were conducting planned maintenance at the Seymour Terminal of the Enterprise Products Operating Company, LLC(EPCO) located in Jackson County, Indiana. Two EPCO employees and two contract employees were injured. * On April 14, 2010, at an Enogex natural gas compressor station in Bennington, Oklahoma, during construction tie-ins related to an expansion project, a contract employee was injured as a result of a flash fire which immediately extinguished itself. The contract employee's injuries required in-patient hospitalization. The cause of the accident was, in part, miscommunication between two crews working in the station at the same time. * On April 23, a pipeline ruptured near Niles, Kansas, due to previous excavation damage. About 1,659 barrels of natural gasoline were lost. * On May 10, 2010, at Swifton, Arkansas, a Mississippi River Transmission Corporation employee arrived at the Swifton M&R; station and found the regulator engulfed in flames, evidently from a direct hit by a lightning strike which perforated the equipment. * On May 29, an Amoco pipeline leaked nearly 89,000 gallons of gasoline into a farm field along Quarterline Road. The leak occurred in Constantine Township, St. Joseph County, Michigan. The cause was from a manufacturing defect in the pipe. * On June 7, a 36-inch Enterprise natural gas pipeline leaked, exploded and started a fire in Johnson County, Texas when it was disturbed by workers installing poles for electrical lines. The mapping of subsurface utilities was inadequate, leading to inaccurate maps. Confusion over the location and status of the construction work led to the pipeline not being marked beforehand. These inaccuracies led to a miscommunication between the locator and the excavator, As a result, one worker was killed and seven were injured. The pipe was manufactured and installed in 1970.PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents (2010-present), PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline- incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. * On June 8, construction workers hit an unmarked 14-inch gas gathering pipeline near Darrouzett, Texas. Two workers were killed. * The Red Butte Creek oil spill. On June 12, a Chevron crude oil pipeline, damage by lightning, ruptured, causing of crude to spill into Red Butte Creek in Salt Lake City, Utah. Crude then flowed into a pond in Liberty Park. * On July 5, a landowner operating a bulldozer hit an 8-inch LPG/propane pipeline near Thomson, Georgia. Later, the propane fumes ignited, killing the adult son of the landowner, and igniting fires that destroyed a trailer house and woodlands. * On July 26, the Kalamazoo River oil spill: Enbridge Energy Partners LLP (Enbridge), reported that a pipeline belonging to Enbridge burst in Marshall, Michigan. Enbridge had numerous alarms from the affected Line 6B, but controllers thought the alarms were from phase separation, and the leak was not reported to Enbridge for 17 hours. Enbridge estimates over of crude oil leaked into Talmadge Creek, a waterway that feeds the Kalamazoo River, whereas EPA reports over 1,139,569 gallons of oil have been recovered as of November 2011. On July 27, 2010, an Administrative Order was issued by U.S. EPA requiring the performance of removal actions in connection with the facility. The Order requires Enbridge to immediately conduct removal of a discharge or to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of a discharge of oil and to submit a Work Plan for the cleanup activities that was to include a Health and Safety Plan, as required by 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER). In 2012, the NTSB later cited known but unrepaired cracks and external corrosion as the cause. * On August 10, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Justice Department announced that Plains All American Pipeline and several of its operating subsidiaries have agreed to spend approximately $41 million to upgrade of crude oil pipeline operated in the United States. The settlement resolves Plains' Clean Water Act violations for ten crude oil spills in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Kansas, and requires the company to pay a $3.25 million civil penalty. * On August 17, smell from a mixture of gasoline and diesel fuel were detected in Hammond, Indiana. The source was from a leaking Amoco/BP pipeline in the area, and about 38,000 gallons of the mixture was released. About 5,000 gallons of the spillage was not recovered. The cause was external corrosion to the pipeline. * On August 24, a gas compressor station in Shongaloo, Louisiana injured one worker. * On August 25, a construction crew installing a gas pipeline in Roberts County, Texas hit an unmarked pipeline, seriously burning one man. * On August 27, an LPG pipeline leaked in Gilboa, New York, forcing the evacuation of 23 people. The cause was stress corrosion cracking. There were no injuries or ignition. * On September 9, 2010 a 30-inch diameter high pressure natural gas pipeline exploded in San Bruno, California, a suburb of San Francisco. The blast destroyed 38 homes and damaged 120 more. More than a hundred people were evacuated. Eight died and at least 50 were injured. Ten acres of brush also burned. Later, PG&E; was unable to supply the California Public Utilities Commission with documents on how PG&E; established pressure limits on some of its gas transmission pipelines. It was also revealed that this pipeline had 26 leaks between Milpitas and San Francisco during the time of 1951 to 2009, with some of the leak causes listed in records as \\"unknown\\". Later hydrostatic testing of the pipeline that failed found a pinhole leak, and a previously damaged section blew out. The pipe was manufactured in 1949.PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents (2010-2017), www.phmsa.dot.govdata-and-statisticspipelinepipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2017.12.29. * On September 9, a 20-inch diameter Columbia Gas Transmission Company pipeline failed in Lawrence County, Kentucky. While there was no fire or evacuations, the condition of this uncoated, non-cathodic protected, unknown grade pipeline caused PHMSA to enter into a Consent Order to eventually replace this pipeline. * On September 28, a repair crew was working on a corroded gas pipe in Cairo, Georgia, when the line exploded. One crew member was killed, and three others burned. * On October 11, equipment failure on Centurion Pipeline caused it to fail in Levelland, Texas, releasing about 428,000 gallons of crude oil. * On October 15, a natural gas pipeline under construction in Grand Prairie, Texas was running a cleaning pig without a pig \\"trap\\" at the end of the pipe. The 150 pound pig was expelled from the pipeline with enough force to fly , and crash through the side of a house. No one was injured. * On November 8, 2010, near Tioga, North Dakota, Aevenia Energy contracted to plow electrical cables underground from an oil well location owned by Amerada Hess Corporation across a wheat field to a power pole. The crew consisted of two bulldozer operators and one employee walking near the plow. Plowing started at the oil well location and had gone about 260 feet when it struck a Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company natural gas transmission line. The 8-inch diameter pipeline, operating at approximately 650 psig, failed after being struck by the plow, killing the person who was standing on the ground near the rupture. The two bulldozer operators jumped off their equipment and ran from the escaping gas. The force of the jetting gas blew the person on the ground 80 feet. None of the parties made a one-call notification prior to the start of the project. Two pipeline marker posts were visible from the access road into the site; the closest about 517 feet south of the rupture.PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 2010-2017,PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and- statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. * On November 12, three men working on natural gas lines were injured when a pipeline ruptured in Monroe, Louisiana. * On November 30, a Tennessee Gas Pipeline 30-inch diameter gas pipeline failed at Natchitoches, Louisiana. There was no fire, but the pipe, which was manufactured in 1948, had a Magnetic Flux smart pig test earlier in the year that indicated no flaws. The failure was at a crack in a wrinkle bend which may have been stressed by shifting soil. The deadly 1965 gas pipeline accident had occurred on a different pipeline owned by the same company nearby. * On December 1, a valve on a crude oil pipeline leaked about of crude in Salt Lake City, Utah. This failure was only 100 yards from a June 2010 failure on the same pipeline. * On December 2, a pipeline was discovered leaking gasoline near Livingston, Illinois. * On December 8, at East Bernard, Texas, a 24-inch diameter Tennessee Gas Pipeline exploded, blasting a 12-foot section of ruptured pipe 295 feet and caused $715,000 in property damage. It took 6 hours for the pipe system to blow down. The cause of the leak was a full guillotine failure of the pipe caused by internal corrosion micro-biologically induced due to moisture in the pipe. The pipe was manufactured in 1948. * On December 17, a gas line fire and explosion just outside Corpus Christi, Texas city limits left one person critically injured. A man was working on removing an abandoned pipeline when it exploded, and his face was severely burned. * On December 21, a crude oil pipeline was discovered leaking into the Dominguez Channel in the Port of Los Angeles. Over 1,000 gallons of crude oil was recovered, but the pipeline company was alleged to have failed to report the spill to State or Federal pipeline authorities. A 61 count criminal complaint was later filed in this accident. * On December 24, 2010, a mechanical failure at a Texas Gas Transmission compressor station near Youngsville, Louisiana, caused a gas leak that ignited and exploded in the middle of the night. The Texas Gas gas control center received alarms indicating fire, vibration, and emergency shutdown alarms were activated. The fire department and state police secured the site. Once cleared by the fire chief on site, Texas Gas personnel assessed the damage. The cause of the incident was compressor component malfunction. The metallurgical report determined that six of eight engine bolts failed due to high cycle fatigue. The equipment has been installed in 1965. * On December 28, a pipeline at an underground gas storage facility in Covington County, Mississippi leaked, forcing the evacuation of about two dozen families for over a week.

Assault and disability At 9:00 am in late February 1993, police in Tallinn's Old Town found an unconscious, bleeding man lying on Vene Street with his pockets turned inside out. Assuming the man was a vagrant and intoxicated, they initially transported him to a sobering up facility in the city's subdistrict of M√§nniku. After he didn't regain consciousness, authorities realized that he was having a medical emergency and he was transported to Mustam√§e Emergency Hospital, where emergency physicians determined that the man had suffered a severe beating.

Career =Minor leagues: 2011 to 2018= Harold Castro was signed by the Tigers in 2010 as a 16-year-old. Castro spent 2011 and 2012 with the Tigers' Venezuelan summer league team, then a half-season with the Gulf Coast Rookie League team. In 2013, he played for the single-A West Michigan Whitecaps and single-A advanced Lakeland Flying Tigers, where he hit .245. He improved to a .286 average the next season, playing for the same two teams. Castro spent the entirety of the 2015 and 2016 regular seasons, and all but eight games of 2017, with the Double-A Erie SeaWolves. Castro's 2017 with Erie was his best at the level. He hit for a .290 average, with a .325 on-base percentage, one home run, 30 RBI, and 20 stolen bases. During the 2018 season, Castro spent 74 games with the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens and hit for a .257 average with two home runs and 17 RBI. He also played 29 games with the SeaWolves, where he had a .282 average with ten RBI. =Detroit Tigers: 2018= On September 21, 2018, the Tigers purchased Castro's minor league contract and added him to the roster after he had spent the last eight years in their minor league system. Since the Mud Hens season had already ended, Castro had to travel back to Detroit from his home in Venezuela. He made his major league debut on September 23, as a pinch runner in the ninth inning of a game against the Kansas City Royals. He made his first MLB start on September 25, against the Minnesota Twins, where he recorded his first major league hit, a single in the top of the eighth inning. He went 3-for-10 (.300) in his brief 2018 stint with the Tigers. Castro was outrighted to Toledo on October 24 and elected free agency. He re-signed a minor league deal on October 31, 2018, with an invitation to spring training. =2019= Castro opened the 2019 season with Triple-A Toledo. On April 30, after hitting .353 for the Mud Hens, his contract was selected and he was recalled to the major league roster. He was optioned back to Toledo on May 13, then recalled again to the Tigers on June 4. On June 19, he hit his first career major league home run off Trevor Williams of the Pittsburgh Pirates. During the 2019 season, Castro played every fielding position except pitcher and catcher. In 354 at-bats for the Tigers, Castro hit .291 with 5 home runs and 38 RBI. Castro was named the 2019 Detroit Tigers Rookie of the Year in voting conducted by Detroit Sports Media association. =2020= Overall with the 2020 Detroit Tigers, Castro batted .347 with no home runs and 3 RBIs in 22 games.https://www.mlb.com/player/harold-castro-605612?stats=career-r-hitting- mlb&year;=2020 References External links Category:1993 births Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Erie SeaWolves players Category:Gulf Coast Tigers players Category:Lakeland Flying Tigers players Category:Leones del Caracas players Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball infielders Category:Major League Baseball players from Venezuela Category:Sportspeople from Caracas Category:Toledo Mud Hens players Category:Venezuelan Summer League Tigers players Category:West Michigan Whitecaps players ","title":"Harold Castro"},{"id":"58545157","text":"Guthrie High School may refer to: *Guthrie High School (Oklahoma) *Guthrie High School (Texas) ","title":"Guthrie High School"},{"id":"58545176","text":"The enzootic nasal tumor virus of the betaretrovirus genus is a carcinogenic retrovirus that causes enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma in sheep and goats. Strain ENTV-1 is found in sheep and strain ENTV-2 is found in goats. The virus causes tumor growth in the upper nasal cavity and is closely related to JSRV which also causes respiratory tumors in ovine. The disease, enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma is common in North America and is found in sheep and goats on every continent except New Zealand and Australia. There are more than 27 betaretroviruses similar to ENVT and JSRV in the ovine genome. In the future, research on ENTV may become important in studying viruses that cause human lung cancer.  Classification  ENTV belongs to the family Retroviridae, to the subfamily Orthoretrovirinae and the genus Betaretrovirus.  Associated disease  = Enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma = The tumors that are induced by ENTV Env have characteristics of adenomas and adenocarcinoma due to well- differentiated epithelial appearance and a less well-differentiated appearance respectively. Symptoms of nasal adenocarcinoma are similar in both goats and sheep. They include weight loss, nasal discharge with the nasal fluid being viscous and containing pus. Tumors form in the upper nasal cavity and have a gelatinous consistency with caudal areas being having hemorrhage causing a brownish-red color. Symptoms of enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma do not appear until it is too late. An ovine that grows a tumor will eventually die of suffocation.  Host interactions  = Pathogenesis = Tumors form in nose and are contagious. ENTV targets the respiratory system in ovine, specifically the upper-airway epithelial cells. Oncogenesis occurs in the nasal turbinate cells A typical oncogenic virus will cause a mutation in a host cell, causing the transformation of host cells from a protooncogene into an oncogene. ENTV is unique among retroviruses because the envelope glycoprotein is an oncogene. It is able to induce tumors by itself. ENTV does not have a viremic stage where the virus enters the blood which is unusual. = Immune response = There is not a humoral immune response to the ENTV capsid protein meaning there are no antibodies produced by the host in response to the virus capsid. However, recent studies have shown that there is sero-conversion in response to the envelope protein if a host is exposed to the virus after a long period of time. These antibodies have proven to be important in preventing further spread of the virus. The antibodies are more likely to respond to the ENTV envelope than the capsid because the envelope is located on the exterior of the virus whereas the capsid is not. The lack of an extensive immune response may be due to the face that a large portion of the ovine genome is made up of sequences that are related to the retroviruses JSRV and ENTV.  Genome structure  ENTV has a conical structure and a similar genome structure as other retroviruses with the basic structure, 5‚Äô-U5-Gag-Pro-Pol-Env-U3-3‚Äô. ENTV has characteristics of both a B type retrovirus and a D type retrovirus. Its envelope is type B and its capsid protein is type D. This means that ENTV is classified as a chimeric type B/D retrovirus. ENTV and JSRV's amino acids are similar by over 95%. This closely links the two viruses and leads to many studies comparing and contrasting the two. The 3‚Äô end of env and the U3 LTR region contain amino acids with the least similarity making these areas important in scientific studies. ENTV 1 and ENTV 2 differ slightly in their genome. Their main differences occur in LTR, Orf-x, several regions in Gag and env TM. It is thought that this difference in the Env TM cytoplasmic tail is important in the spreading of the virus to host species. = Gag = ENTV gag encodes a chain of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, or a polypeptide that contains 613 amino acids. Gag is also responsible for encoding structural proteins including the capsid protein, the matrix shell and the nucleic acid binding protein. = Pro = Pro encodes a 326 amino acid polypeptide and generally works with gag to form a gag-pro polypeptide due to ribosomal frame shifting. It encodes the viral protease which breaks down the viral proteins into peptides and amino acids. = Pol = Pol encodes a 870 amino acid peptide. It is usually translated to make a gag-pro-pol polypeptide due to ribosomal frame shifting. Inside the pol gene is an open reading frame, Orf-x which is abnormal for simple retroviruses. Pol is important because it encodes reverse transcriptase and integrase. = Env = Env is generated by splicing and overlaps pol at the start. It encodes surface and transmembrane envelope proteins by being cleaved twice, a polypeptide precursor, and a hydrophobic region. Env plays a large role in the functionality of ENTV. Env is important in ENVT tissue selectivity. = LTR = LTR is 374 bases long and contains the primer binding site and the polypurine tract. It is made up of inverted repeat sequences GCAG and CTGC. tRNALys1,2 is the reverse transcriptase primer for ENVT. The U3 region of LTR is important for replication and transcription regulatory signaling. The U3 region is also important in tissue selectivity.  Receptor and entry  The cellular receptor for ENTV is hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2) in sheep. Hyal2 is a cell surface molecule that is anchored by glycosylphosphatidylinositol. ENTV's binding is very restrictive compared to other retroviruses but it is also able to bind to human and bovine Hyal2 homologs. ENTV entry is pH-dependent which is a unique feature among retroviruses. An extremely low pH of 4.5 is needed for the virus to perform fusion activation and cell entry this is much lower than JSRV which requires a ph of around 6. Fusion activation of ENTV requires a lower pH than cell entry. An over expression of Hya2 is required for ENTV infection. ENTV may prefer to replicate in the nasal turbinate chondrocytes because of the high concentration of the receptor. The low pH is beneficial to the virus by creating a tumor prone environment that activates HA degradation enzymes. The TM subunit of the env gene plays an important role in the entry of ENTV into a cell. The SU subunit of the env gene also plays an important role in cell entry by influencing the low pH-dependent fusion activity.

Early life and education Margaret Barrington was born in Malin, County Donegal on 10 May 1896. Her parents were Richard Barrington, RIC sergeant, and Charlotte Barrington (n√©e Scott), one of their three daughters. She spent much of her childhood living with her maternal grandfather due to her mother's poor health. She later moved to Dungannon, County Tyrone with her parents. She attended the Royal School, Dungannon, then Alexandra College, Dublin, and then in Normandy. She went on to enter Trinity College Dublin (TCD), graduating with a BA in modern literature with a gold medal in 1918. In 1922 she married the historian Edmund Curtis. Following this she taught German and French at a number of Dublin schools. Writing career Her first published work was an article on the treatment of women students in TCD's College Miscellany on 5 June 1918. As she continued to publish, she regularly attended George William Russell gatherings, meeting such figures as W. B. Yeats and James Stephens. Liam O'Flaherty described her as \\"the little marvel of the literary circle here\\" after he was introduced to her in early 1924. It appears that she and O'Flaherty begun an affair soon after, which saw Barrington leaving her husband by July 1924 and living with O'Flaherty in England. In August 1924 she contributed a short story to Francis Stuart's journal To-morrow, entitled Colour which tackled sexual and racial taboos. Upon her return to Ireland with O'Flaherty in December 1924, they received a cold reception from their old friends, suffering financially for a time. Once Barrington divorced Curtis, she married O'Flaherty in London in March 1926. Their only child, Pegeen, was born there soon after. O'Flaherty actively encouraged her to write during this time, but for the eight years they were married, Barrington wrote very little. She blamed this lack of writing on the \\"difficulties\\" of married life. Their marriage was failing by the late 1920s, seeing Barrington writing to their friend, A. D. Peters, to enquire if he knew where O'Flaherty was. In 1932 they separated, and Barrington settled in London. In the following years were the most productive of her life, when she translated, wrote, organised support of republicans in the Spanish Civil War, and assisting refugees from Nazi Germany. She was a supporter of the British Labour Party, taking on the women's column of the left-wing paper Tribune in November 1938. Upon the outbreak of World War II, Barrington returned to Ireland, living in Leap, County Cork with friends Ewart Milne and Stella Jackson. From 1941 to 1952 she was a regular contributor to The Bell with letters, reviews, essays and short stories. She lived in Castletownsend from 1947 to 1953, then settled in Kinsale. Later life and legacy The later years of Barrington's life were lived in relative obscurity. She died in a Kinsale nursing home on 8 March 1982, and is buried locally. David's daughter Tamar, a collection of her short stories was published posthumously in 1982. At least three of her novels remain unpublished. Her short story, Village Without Men, from 1982 was included in the anthology The Glass Shore: Short Stories by Women Writers from the North of Ireland.

It was situated in the northwest of the Peloponnese, to the west of Arcadia. The position of the city of Elis was the best that could have been chosen for the capital of the country. Just before the Peneius emerges from the hills into the plain, the valley of the river is contracted on the south by a projecting hill of a peaked form, and nearly in height. This hill was the acropolis of Elis, and commanded as well the narrow valley of the Peneius as the open plain beyond. The ancient city lay at the foot of the hill, and extended across the river, as Strabo says that the Peneius flowed through the city; but since no remains are now found on the right or northern bank, it is probable that all the public buildings were on the left bank of the river, more especially as Pausanias does not make any allusion to the river in his description of the city. Elis is mentioned as a town of the Epeii by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad; but in the earliest times the two chief towns in the country appear to have been Ephyra the residence of Augeias, in the interior, and Buprasium on the coast. Some writers suppose that Ephyra was the more ancient name of Elis, but it appears to have been a different place, situated upon the Ladon. Elis first became a place of importance upon the invasion of Peloponnesus by the Dorians. Oxylus and his Aetolian followers appear to have settled on the height which later formed Elis's acropolis as the spot best adapted for ruling the country. From this time it was the residence of the kings, and of the aristocratic families who governed the country after the abolition of royalty. Elis was the only fortified town in the country; the rest of the inhabitants dwelt in unwalled villages, paying obedience to the ruling class at Elis. Soon after the Greco-Persian Wars the exclusive privileges of the aristocratic families in Elis were abolished, and a democratic government established. Along with this revolution a great change took place in the city of Elis. The city appears to have been originally confined to the acropolis; but the inhabitants of many separate townships, eight according to Strabo, now removed to the capital, and built round the acropolis a new city, which they left undefended by walls, relying upon the sanctity of their country. At the same time the Eleians were divided into a certain number of local tribes; or if the latter existed before, they now acquired for the first time political rights. The Hellanodicae, or presidents of the Ancient Olympic Games, who had formerly been taken from the aristocratic families, were now appointed, by lot, one from each of the local tribes; and the fluctuating number of the Hellanodicae shows the increase and decrease from time to time of the Eleian territory. It is probable that each of the three districts into which Elis was divided, Hollow Elis, Pisatis, and Triphylia, contained four tribes. This is in accordance with the fourfold ancient division of Hollow Elis, and with the twice four townships in the Pisatis. Pausanias in his account of the number of the Hellanodicae says that there were 12 Hellanodicae in 103rd Olympiad, which was immediately after the Battle of Leuctra, when the Eleians recovered for a short time their ancient dominions, but that being shortly afterwards deprived of Triphylia by the Arcadians, the number of their tribes was reduced to eight. 6. When Pausanias visited Elis, it was one of the most populous and splendid cities of Greece. By the mid-19th century, however, nothing of it remained except some masses of tile and mortar, several wrought blocks of stone and fragments of sculpture, and a square building about on the outside, which within is in the form of an octagon with niches. With such scanty remains it would be impossible to attempt any reconstruction of the city, and to assign to particular sites the buildings mentioned by Pausanias. et seq. Strabo says that the gymnasium stood on the side of the river Peneius; and it is probable that the gymnasium and agora occupied the greater part of the space between the river and the citadel. The gymnasium was a vast enclosure surrounded by a wall. It was by far the largest gymnasium in Greece, which is accounted for by the fact that all the athletes in the Ancient Olympic Games were obliged to undergo a month's previous training in the gymnasium at Elis. The enclosure bore the general name of Xystus, and within it there were special places destined for the runners, and separated from one another by plane-trees. The gymnasium contained three subdivisions, called respectively Plethrium, Tetragonum, and Malco: the first so called from its dimensions, the second from its shape, and the third from the softness of the soil. In their Malco was the senate-house of the Eleians, called Lalichium from the name of its founders: it was also used for literary exhibitions. The gymnasium had two principal entrances, one leading by the street called Siope or Silence to the baths, and the other above the cenotaph of Achilles to the agora and the Hellanodicaeum. The agora was also called the hippodrome, because it was used for the exercise of horses. It was built in the ancient style, and, instead of being surrounded by an uninterrupted, series of stoae or colonnades, its stoae were separated, from one another by streets. The southern stoa, which consisted of a triple row of Doric columns, was the usual resort of the Hellanodicae during the day. Towards one end of this stoa to the left was the Hellanodicaeum, a building divided from the agora by a street, which was the official residence of the Hellanodicae, who received here instruction in their duties for ten months preceding the festival. There was another stoa in the agora called the Corcyraean stoa, because it had been built out of the tenth of some spoils taken from the Corcyraeans. It consisted of two rows of Doric columns, with a partition wall running between them: one side was open to the agora, and the other to a temple of Aphrodite Urania, in which was a statue of the goddess in gold and ivory by Pheidias. In the open part of the agora, Pausanias mentions the temple of Apollo Acacesius, which was the principal temple in Elis, statues of Helios and Selene (Sun and Moon), a temple of the Graces, a temple of Silenus, and the tomb of Oxylus. On the way to the theatre was the temple of Hades, which was opened only once in the year. The theatre must have been on the slope of the acropolis: it is described by Pausanias as lying between the agora and the Menius, which, if the name is not corrupt, must be the brook flowing down from the heights behind the old town. Near the theatre was a temple of Dionysus, containing a statue of this god by Praxiteles. On the acropolis was a temple of Athena, containing a statue of the goddess in gold and ivory by Pheidias. On the summit of the acropolis are the remains of a castle, in the walls of which Ernst Curtius noticed, when he visited in the 19th century, some fragments of Doric columns which probably belonged to the temple of Athena. In the immediate neighbourhood of Elis was Petra, where the tomb of the philosopher Pyrrho was shown. The acropolis of Elis is now called Kalokaspoi in Greek and the Venetians, who occupied the area in the Middle Ages, transformed this name into Belvedere.

In 1713‚Äì15 he was acting governor general of the French Antilles Early years (to 1684) Robert Cloche, squire, sieur of La Malmaison, was from a family from Nancy, Lorraine, ennobled by Charles III, Duke of Lorraine on 12 August 1596. His father was Georges Cloche, a prosecutor of the king and then a lawyer in the √âlection d'√âpernay, part of the G√©n√©ralit√© de Ch√¢lons in the province of Champagne. He was an officer in the Picardy regiment. King's lieutenant in Guadeloupe (1684‚Äì1705) Pierre Hincelin was governor of Guadeloupe from 5 July 1677 until 1694, when he was replaced by Charles Auger. On 19 September 1684 La Malmaison was appointed king's lieutenant in Guadeloupe. He became a knight of the Order of Saint Louis. He brought two of his nephews to Guadeloupe, George and Nicolas, sons of his younger brother George. 240px During the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì97) the governor general of the Windward Islands Charles de Courbon de Bl√©nac resigned on 29 January 1690 after criticism of his lack of response to the English attacks on Saint Barthelemy, Marie-Galante and Saint Martin, and returned to France to defend himself at court. Fran√ßois d'Alesso d'√âragny was appointed his successor in May 1690, but the marquis de Seignelay did not treat his departure as a matter of urgency. D'Eragny arrived in Martinique on 5 February 1691 with 14 ships and began to strengthen the defenses. At the end of May 1691 the English under Christopher Codrington, who had taken Marie-Galante, appeared off Guadeloupe. Governor Hincelin was suffering from severe hydropsy, which limited his mobility, and retired into the interior. 400 men under La Malmaison as king's lieutenant delayed the English for a day before being forced back. The French troops retreated into Fort Saint-Charles(fr) and were besieged there by the English. La Malmaison led the resistance of the fort at Basse-Terre for 36 days, when d'Eragny arrived in Guadeloupe with a force of buccaneers and other troops, at which Codrington hastily reembarked leaving behind cannons and some of his wounded. By early 1701 it was clear that another European war was imminent, since the Duke of Anjou had just become King Philip V of Spain, and the other powers of Europe would not allow one family to hold the crowns of France and Spain. In July 1701 the governor general of the French West Indies, Charles Desnotz, came to Guadeloupe to consult with governor Charles Auger, and to urge him to immediately start preparations for war. La Malmaison was commander of Guadeloupe in the absence of the governor in 1701 and 1702. Guadeloupe, Dominica and Martinique On 19 March 1703 an English invasion fleet under Hovenden Walker and Christopher Codrington was sighted off the south of Guadeloupe. Over the next few days the English disembarked over 4,000 troops at three landing points. La Malmaison was second in command to Governor Auger. Their 1,400 French militiamen were forced back to Fort Saint Charles in Basse-Terre. On 3 April 1703 a French fleet arrived under Jean Gabaret, lieutenant general for the French Antilles, with 820 men from Martinique. The subordinate commanders included Bonnaventure-Fran√ßois de Boisferm√©, Louis Gaston Caquery de Valmeni√®re, Jean Clair Dyel Du Parquet, Fran√ßois de Collart and Jean Du Buc. An attempt to hold Fort Francis failed, and the French were forced to the east. The English left Guadeloupe on 15 May 1703 after causing great material damage but few French casualties. Governor of Guadeloupe (1705‚Äì17) La Malmaison was governor and lieutenant general of Guadeloupe from 1 November 1705 until his death on 1 May 1717. He replaced Bonnaventure-Fran√ßois de Boisferm√©, acting governor of Guadeloupe. He also replaced Joseph d'Honon de Galiffet (died 1706), who had been appointed governor of Guadeloupe in 1703 but had not taken office. One of his first acts was to expel the English from the neighboring island of Marie- Galante. A letter from the Secretary of the Navy of 3 October 1708 discussed militia appointments and other military matters, and reprimanded him for his violence against M. Du Boucher, negligence in defense of the island and interference in the judicial field. A letter of 29 November 1709 discussed the arrival in Guadeloupe of M. de Valmeini√®re, insubordination of the colony's officers, fortifications proposed by the Sieur Binois, cannons that had been sent him, privateering rules, supply of slaves, arguments he had with the Sieur Du Bouchet, relations with the island's council, organization of militias, lack of religious services at Fort Saint-Louis and other subjects. A letter of 4 April 1712 discussed the arrival of ships carrying supplies, repression of foreign trade, construction of the church at Fort Saint-Louis, the failed attack by the English on Canada in September 1710 and other matters. A letter from the Secretary of State of the Navy dated 28 January 1713 discussed subjects such as the slave trade, defense of Guadeloupe, marriage of young men, trade and the visit of Raymond Balthazar Ph√©lypeaux, governor and lieutenant general of the French islands and mainland of America. It authorized La Malmaison to assume governorship of the Windward Islands in the event of the absence or death of Ph√©lypeaux. Ph√©lypeaux died on 21 October 1713, and La Malmaison became interim governor of the American islands. He arrived in Martinique on 8 January 1714. On 1 January 1714 the Marquis Abraham Duquesne-Guitton was appointed governor and lieutenant general of the French Windward islands. He was received in Martinique on 2 January 1715. La Malmaison died on 1 May 1717. He was succeeded in May 1717 by Savinien-Michel de Lagarrigue de Savigny as interim governor.

Until 1997, the Armed Forces of Turkmenistan included the Border Troops of the Ministry of Defense, which were then transformed into the State Border Service. It cooperated with Russian border guards who remained in country until 1999 as a result of a joint Russian-Turkmen agreement on the protection of the state border of Turkmenistan, which was signed in 1993. It slowly evolved to meet the standards of its counterparts, with the DSG being allowed to inspect goods and other items transported across the border of Turkmenistan in April 1998. At the end of 2001, 3 new border detachments were created, with 2 (in Kushka and K√∂√Ωtendag), being intensified the cover of the Afghan border to prevent Taliban fighters from taking refuge in the country during the War in Afghanistan. Recently, the service created a separate naval border patrol division stationed in Turkmenbashi.

History The Wahrendorff breech of the C/61. After the Franco-Prussian War, the German Army began to study replacements for its existing C/61 steel breech-loaded cannons. Although the C/61 had outclassed its bronze muzzle-loaded French rivals during the war it's Wahrendorff breech was unpopular with gun crews. The new gun designated the C/73 would retain the same caliber of the C/61 and would equip cavalry artillery regiments. The German and Austro-Hungarian Army during that period rounded up to the nearest centimeter. In addition to the German Army, C/73's also armed the Ottoman Empire and a number of the Balkan states. The Balkan states either bought them from Germany, built them under license or inherited Ottoman guns after they left the region. Although largely replaced by the German Army before the First World War a combination of higher than expected losses and insufficient ammunition production led to the C/73 being brought out of reserve and issued as replacements to artillery regiments. Design Although made of steel like its predecessor the C/73 was of built-up construction with a central rifled tube, a reinforcing hoop from the trunnions to the breech and a larger propellant chamber for higher muzzle velocities and greater range. The C/73 featured a new breech which was known as a cylindro- prismatic breech that was a predecessor of Krupp's horizontal sliding-block and the gun used separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. Since the C/73 had limited elevation +8¬∞ to +24¬∞ it was a direct fire weapon meant to fire on infantry in the open and the most common types of shells were canister, common and shrapnel. The C/73 had a box trail carriage built from bolted steel plates instead of wood. The C/73 did not have a recoil mechanism or a gun shield. For transport, the gun was attached to a limber for towing by a six-horse team. The limber also had seats for crew members plus ammunition and supplies. There were also seats attached to the axle of the gun carriage for the crew.

Personal life Ray Buchan was born in Thames, in the Waikato region of New Zealand‚Äôs North Island, and studied at the Thames School of Mines. He married Florence Dixon (1907‚Äì1983) of Wellington in 1940. They had one child. Ray died in 1986. Florence is buried in Akatarawa Cemetery, Upper Hutt. Cricket career =Early days= A right-arm medium-pace bowler and lower-order batsman, Buchan played for Karaka in the Thames cricket competition and played for the Thames Cricket Association in representative matches. After some time in Auckland, in early 1937 he moved to Wellington, where he played for the Institute club in the Wellington Cricket Association. In the first match of the 1937-38 season he took 8 for 47. He was elected captain of Institute in 1938-39. He transferred to Hutt, another club in the Wellington Cricket Association, before the 1939-40 season, and took 7 for 21 in his first match, bowling with \\"good length and plenty of life\\". He was selected for Town in the Town v Country trial match in December 1939, but the match was spoilt by rain. (includes team photo). In 1942-43 Hutt went through the season undefeated and won the championship, Buchan taking 60 wickets at an average of 6.48 to head the competition averages. Hutt won the championship again in 1943-44, Buchan taking 48 wickets at 9.62, including a hat trick in the last match. =First- class cricket= Buchan made his first-class debut in 1943-44 at the age of 35, taking four wickets in two matches for Wellington. He missed most of the 1944-45 season after an operation for appendicitis. When the Plunket Shield resumed in the 1945-46 season after its wartime suspension, Buchan was 37 years old. He was not initially selected in Wellington's team, but in a one- day practice match on 22 December, playing for The Rest against the Wellington team at Basin Reserve, he took 6 for 45 off 27 overs and was largely responsible for the defeat of the Shield team. He replaced Don Beard, who had not fully recovered from burns he had received while fighting a fire, in Wellington's team for the Plunket Shield match against Otago that began two days later. (Beard did not play Plunket Shield cricket until 1950-51, when he played for Central Districts in their inaugural match. He later played Test cricket.) Buchan took 3 for 57 and 3 for 70 against Otago (match figures of 66‚Äì21‚Äì127‚Äì6), and made 37 batting at number 10 in the first innings, but Otago won by three wickets. In the second match of the Shield a few days later, he took 7 for 66 off 39.1 overs in Canterbury's first innings, but again Wellington lost. It was the only seven-wicket haul in that season's Plunket Shield. When the touring Australians played Wellington later in the season, Buchan took 4 for 99 off 42.1 overs. All four of his victims ‚Äì Lindsay Hassett, Keith Miller, Colin McCool and Bruce Dooland ‚Äì were bowled. He was the only New Zealander to take more than three wickets in an innings in the four provincial matches against the Australians.Wisden 1947, pp. 628‚Äì29.

It is located near U.S. Route 90 Alternate (US 90A) west of the county seat at Hallettsville. The first Anglo-American settlers arrived here in the 1830s, but by the late 1800s they were replaced by Germans and Czechs. The population declined after the 1940s. In 2018 the Vysehrad Independent School District operated an area school and a community center existed on US 90A. Geography Wied Hall is located on US 90A approximately midway between Hallettsville and Shiner. The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) places Wied at the intersection of FM 1891 and County Road 372, which is north of US 90A. The Vysehrad Elementary School is located east of Wied on County Road 182 to the north of US 90A. History The first Anglo-Americans to arrive in the area were John Smeathers (the son of Old Three Hundred settler William Smeathers) in 1832 and Francis Smith in 1835. These were followed by Moses Mitchell and Anthony Brown after the area became part of the Republic of Texas. These early settlers discovered the rolling prairie between Smeathers and Ponton Creeks was ideal for raising horses and cattle and growing cotton and corn. By the 1870s, German immigrants replaced the earlier settlers and broke up the ranches into farms. A small settlement that included a store, blacksmith shop, and a cotton gin grew up on land belonging to the Wied brothers. A wave of Czech immigrants arrived in the area in the 1880s and 1890s. The Wied post office was established in the store from 1889 to 1906. The population was 40 in the 1890s. F. F. Kuehn ran a private school which closed in 1895. In that year F. W. Wunderlich donated land for a public school. Czech Catholics built St. Ludmilla's Church in 1919. Cotton was the basis on the local economy. By the 1940s, Wied's population was 100 and there were three businesses. However, by the 1950s there were only about 40 persons living there and the store and cotton gin closed. In 2000 there were about 65 persons living in the area. File:Wied TX Community Center.jpgWied Hall is on US 90A west of Hallettsville. Education The Vysehrad Elementary School is located to the east of Wied at 595 County Road 182. The school educates students from Kindergarten through 8th grade. It was established in 1887 on the Francis Smith League and is still at its original location. Total enrollment varies but is under 100.

Biography Kate Brown Stephens was born circa 1853 in London, England. Her father, Thomas Brown, was a cab driver; her mother, Mary Tyler Brown, died when Kate was in her late teens or early twenties. Helping to raise her younger brother George while the family lived in the Kensington area of London, Kate is said to have worked at the Natural History Museum. She immigrated to the United States around 1888-1890. She lived for a short time in the city of San Diego, working as a dressmaker, before moving out to the Witch Creek area in eastern San Diego County, where she may have taught school. In 1898, she married ornithologist and mammalogist Frank Stephens and began working with him as a collector and naturalist. Her early field work included collecting butterflies, but her research interest area was shells and fossils, and she became known as the authority on terrestrial and marine mollusks of the San Diego region. Kate Stephens accompanied her husband on many collecting trips in the early 1900s, including a four-month expedition in 1902 to the Colorado Desert for the U. S. Biological Survey. Her field notes from that trip and others record in detail traveling and camping in the California and Arizona desert regions. She and her husband were among the naturalists on the 1907 University of California Alexander expedition to southeastern Alaska. In July 1910, the San Diego Society of Natural History hired Kate Stephens as Curator of Collections, and she effectively became the San Diego Natural History Museum's first paid employee. Her husband served as the director and Curator of Mammals for the museum's first eleven years, and together the couple significantly influenced the scope and direction of the new museum. Widely considered an authority on the algae and shells of the Pacific, Kate Stephens was the museum's Curator of Mollusks and Marine Invertebrates; her work included identifying fossil shells of the San Diego County in connection with paleontological work conducted by Frank Stephens and U. S. Grant IV. At the museum she taught natural history to local children; among her students were Laurence Huey, later the museum's Curator of Birds and Mammals, and Carl L. Hubbs, ichthyologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Five molluscan species were named in her honor: *Amphithalamus stephensae Bartsch, 1927 *Cerithiopsis stephensae Bartsch, 1909 *Gafrarium stephensae Jordan, 1936 (syn. Gouldia californica Dall, 1917) *Odostomia stephensae Dall & Bartsch, 1909 (syn. O. tenuisculpta Carpenter, 1864) *Rissoina stephensae Baker, Hanna & Strong, 1930 In addition, a chaenopsid blenny, Neoclinus stephensae, was named in her honor in 1953 by Carl. L Hubbs, Stephens having collected the type. Retiring from the museum in 1936, Stephens continued her interest in conchology into her 90s, until disabled by vision loss in her later years. Kate Stephens died on August 29, 1954 in San Diego.

He also served as U.S. Soccer's National Director of Referee Instruction from 1988 until 1992 and is often credited with being the father of its national referee instruction program.  Professional career  Evans worked in the North American Soccer League (NASL), the country's top professional league at the time, first as a linesman (now termed \\"assistant referee\\") and then as a referee from 1971 until the demise of the league in 1985. Evans was also an exceptional linesman, evidenced by the fact he was appointed to serve as linesman for the 1982 NASL final (\\"Soccer Bowl 82\\"). He also refereed in the American Soccer League (ASL), a second division professional league at the time, where his friend and referee mentor, Pat Smith was Director of Officials.  International career  In 1979, U.S. Soccer nominated Evans to serve on its FIFA Panel of Referees, which at that time was limited in number to seven. He was the first referee from U.S. Soccer's Region III to receive that honor. During the time he spent on the international panel, Evans refereed fifteen (15) full international A matches over an eight-year stretch that included games throughout the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) and trips to Asia for tournaments. He refereed teams from every F.I.F.A. confederation and officiated FIFA World Cup and Olympic qualifying games  Administration and Instruction  In 1974, Eddie Pearson, considered the founder of the U.S. Soccer National Referee Program, Pat Smith, Harry Baldwin, Roger Schott, Don Byron, Evans, and others met in New York to lay the foundations of the U.S. Soccer National Referee Program. Later, Bob would retire from the international panel early so that he could accept the position of National Director of Referee Instruction. From 1988 to 1992, Evans served as National Director of Referee Instruction for U.S. Soccer, during which time he designed the curriculum for the first national assessor's course and created the instructor and assessor grades that are still used by U.S. Soccer today. In 1992, he became the first American to be appointed a FIFA referee instructor. Evans was recognized as an expert on Law 11 (Offside), producing a comprehensive set of slides on the subject and later narrating a video produced by U.S. Soccer.  Author  Evans authored several books for linesmen (assistant referees), including \\"Manual for Linesmen\\" and \\"Teaching Offside\\" (with Tony Waiters) and \\"For the Good of the Game: Modern Techniques and Practical Wisdom for Today's Soccer Referee\\" (with long-time colleague, retired FIFA referee Edward Bellion, Ph.D.). He was also a frequent contributor to Soccer America and a freelance science journalist with contributions to Smithsonian and American Scientist. Evans was an active blogger on his website, For the Integrity of Soccer.  Playing  Evans grew up playing soccer (football) in the local youth soccer leagues. When he entered the University of Nottingham, he played goalkeeper for the University football club. His academic pursuits would later take him to Canada and then to the United States, where he continued to play amateur football as a goalkeeper.  Coaching   Awards  Evans was elected to the North Texas Soccer Hall of Fame and received the Eddie Pearson Award from U.S. Soccer in 1992. In 1994, he received the William Scofield Award after recovering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and continuing to make significant contributions to the game and U.S. referee program. In 2016, the Region III of the United States Adult Soccer Association created the Robert Evans Lifetime Achievement Award to honor the person making the greatest contribution to soccer refereeing in region III.  Research Geologist  Evans worked as a research geologist for Mobil Oil Company in Dallas from 1969 to 1988. He specialized in the geology of evaporites, a type of rock that forms the seal above many petroleum evaporites, and published many articles and monographs on the subject.  Personal life  The middle child and only boy among three siblings, Evans grew up in Gowerton, near Swansea, the son of Ted Allsopp, an army officer, and Gwladys, a nurse. (When his parents divorced, he and his siblings took their stepfather's surname, Evans.) He attended and earned a degree in geology from Nottingham University, where he was also active in student politics. Subsequently, Evans moved to Canada to study geology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. His academic interest then took him to the University of Kansas, where he earned a doctorate of philosophy (Ph.D.), also in geology. Evans traveled to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in Alvin, the U.S. navy submarine, climbed volcanoes to investigate their geology, and flew light aircraft.

Mangelsen (born January 6, 1946) is an American nature and wildlife photographer and conservationist. He is most famous for his photography of wildlife in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, as he has lived inside the zone in Jackson, Wyoming, for over 40 years. In 2015, he and nature author Todd Wilkinson created a book, The Grizzlies of Pilgrim Creek, featuring a grizzly bear known as Grizzly 399, named so due to her research number. He has been active in the movement to keep the Yellowstone area grizzly bears on the Endangered Species List. Mangelsen is also known for trekking to all seven continents to photograph a diverse assortment of nature and wildlife. A photograph he took in 1988 titled, \\"Catch of the Day\\" has been labeled \\"the most famous wildlife photograph in the world\\". In May 2018, he was profiled on CBS 60 Minutes. He has received dozens of accolades throughout the decades.  Background  Thomas D. Mangelsen was born on January 6, 1946, in Grand Island, Nebraska. His sportsman father took him on trips on the nearby Platte River. Mangelsen and his brothers went hunting, fishing, and trapping with their father for ducks and geese. Their father also took them to observe the sandhill crane migration, and other waterfowl through his blinds. It was when Mangelsen was 21 that he became involved in photography. = Education = * 1965-1967 University of Nebraska, Business * 1967-1969 Doane College, Crete, Nebraska, Biology BS * University of Nebraska, Zoology, Postgraduate Studies * Colorado State University, Wildlife Biology, Postgraduate Studies  Career  Mangelsen spent most of his adult life observing and photographing the American wilderness. After moving to Nederland, Colorado, in 1970, he spent a couple of years there living in an abandoned mining shack with no facilities, with two dogs and a raccoon. He honed his photography skills and studied at the University of Colorado Boulder Mountain Research Station. The university is near Nederland, which made it easy for him to study Arctic Alpine Ecology while living in the shack. Mangelsen desired to create a documentary featuring the Platte River, so he returned annually in the spring to film the sandhill crane migration. This led to Mangelsen following the cranes to their nesting areas in Alaska and wintering range in Texas. = Wildlife and nature photography = National Geographic planned to make a documentary about the whooping crane, which is endangered, so when they discovered Mangelsen's experiences, they hired him as the cinematographer for their television documentary Flight of the Whooping Crane. It was released in 1984 and earned an Emmy Award nomination. In 1990, PBS Nature and BBC Natural World hired Mangelsen to work on their documentary, Cranes of the Grey Wind. Mangelsen photographed and produced the film, which documents the lifecycle of the sandhill crane. Not long after, the International Institute of Photographic Arts retained a permanent collection of 21 prints of his work. Early in the 1970s, Mangelsen started selling prints of his images of birds in flight. As Mangelsen's main interest was photographing birds, in 1978 he opened his first photography gallery in Jackson, Wyoming, the Images of Nature Gallery. As his popularity grew, Mangelsen continued expanding and today there are over 13 galleries across the country. Mangelsen also became involved in conservationism. A photograph which Mangelsen took in 1988 is symbolic to his career. The photograph labeled \\"Catch of the Day\\" is \\"the most famous wildlife photograph in the world\\", and it typifies Mangelsen's approach to photography. An exhibition of his work was on display in September 2018 in the Durham Museum \\"Thomas D. Mangelsen: A Life in the Wild\\", and it premiered in Omaha, Nebraska. It was a traveling exhibition that highlighted 40 \\"Legacy Reserve\\" photographs taken from the approximately four million shots of his career. Mangelsen has worked with several authors over the years to illustrate their books with his photographs. He has also produced his own books of his photography. One example is his book The Natural World: Portraits of Earth's Great Ecosystems, featuring a foreword by primatologist Jane Goodall. The book was awarded the Benjamin Franklin top honor in the Coffee Table/Large Format category by the Independent Publishers Association in 2007. He also co-founded a non-profit organization for cougars, The Cougar Fund. He is a founding Fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers. He sits on the International Advisory Council for the Jane Goodall Institute. He also acts as a Board Ambassador for the Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance. Now in 2019, at 73 years old, Mangelsen has established himself as one of the best wildlife photographers and conservationists in the world. His photography has been displayed in countless books, magazines, galleries, and museums. Such magazines include National Geographic, Audubon, Smithsonian, Natural History, Newsweek, Wildlife Art, American Photo, National Wildlife, and countless others. He has also embraced other media for a younger audience which is available through his galleries. Photographing wildlife involves lots of preparation, planning, and patience. He says most people do not realize how much time goes into professional photography of wildlife. \\"Certain things I plan a year in advance, and certain things I do every year,\\" Mangelsen says. \\"I go back to Nebraska to photograph cranes on the Platte because that's where I grew up, and I love cranes, and I love being there.\\" He also plans trips to Africa annually, and other expeditions on an irregular basis. Mangelsen's life work is best summed up in his own words: =CBS 60 Minutes appearance= On May 6, 2018, Mangelsen, who lives in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, appeared on an episode of CBS 60 Minutes with reporter Anderson Cooper. The discussion highlighted some of his most significant experiences in wildlife photography. The previous September, for example, he waited a long time for a subject to arrive at a spot in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. The subject turned out to be an elk. And he told Cooper that the amount of time he has waited for subjects is \\"stupid\\". But he is also known for his patience; as he noted, if \\"You wait long enough, it does pay off\\". The longest he has spent waiting in one spot is 42 days for one cougar, comprising 12 to 14 hours per day with breaks to sleep at home. He finally got the shot of the female cougar at dusk emerging from her den. The shot was important as it helped with the movement to protect cougars against humans invading their habitat. He began selling prints from his own galleries in 1970. His work does not include any sort of digital manipulation, and is often mistaken for paintings. He also stays away from game farms or any other type of captive habitat, preferring to shoot animals only in their native habitat. \\"He especially likes the dangerous kind\\", whether it be getting too close to male polar bears who were play fighting or photographing a Bengal tiger from atop an elephant. Mangelsen has been on every continent and filmed species of every type from grizzly bears to butterflies to rhinos. Some species he has photographed are now endangered. =Grizzly 399= One of the grizzly bears who lives in Grand Teton National Park and Bridger-Teton National Forest, and has no name, but is known by her research number is Grizzly 399. In 2015, Mangelsen collaborated with Bozeman, Montana, author Todd Wilkinson to create the book Grizzlies of Pilgrim Creek, An Intimate Portrait of 399, The Most Famous Bear of Greater Yellowstone. In 2018, she was 22 years old. Mangelsen has made it one of his priorities for over ten years to record her life. This includes her hibernation schedule, feeding, and mothering - of her over a dozen cubs, he recorded the birth of three sets of triplets and a set of twins. His photographs, especially the one he dubbed \\"An Icon of Motherhood\\", made her the most famous mother grizzly, maybe the most famous grizzly, in the world. = Endangered species list = In 2017, United States Fish and Wildlife Service officials removed grizzly bears outside the Yellowstone Park and the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho from the endangered species list, also known as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. On May 23, 2018, a Wyoming wildlife commission voted unanimously on an approval for a grizzly bear hunt. The hunt would have been the first in the state in over forty years and sanctioned the killing of up to 22 bears. This would have occurred just one year after bears were removed from the endangered species list. For the 2018 hunting season, Montana had decided against a hunt. Idaho, with the fewest grizzlies, decided to allow hunting of only one bear. Wyoming planned for the hunting of up to 22 bears. No hunting was to be allowed inside the national parks or the connecting road between them. Hunters in the area said they would target 399 because she is the biggest trophy, the most famous. Grizzly 399 lives in the Grand Teton National Park part of the year, which is near Yellowstone Park. However, she also dens in the national forest which is not part of any park. Big game hunting is allowed there, so that is where likely where hunters would have targeted her. In July 2018, Mangelsen helped fuel a movement that five women quickly organized called \\"Shoot'em With A CameraNot A Gun.\\" The object was to enlist people against trophy hunting to join the lottery for Wyoming's bear hunting licenses. The plan was to win a tag and keep it, so it would not be used to kill a bear. In Wyoming, approximately 7,000 people applied for bear tags. This list included Mangelsen and Jane Goodall, as well as many other well known conservationists. In May 2018, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department let a vote decide the number of grizzlies to be killed. The tally came to 22 grizzlies. Mangelsen has lived in Wyoming for over 40 years and has been actively involved in bear conservation in the state during that time. Additionally, both national parks generate more than $1 billion annually through tourism. The two highest animal generators are grizzlies and wolves. The amount generated by just those two apex predators eclipses what Wyoming spends on bear management by a vast amount. In July 2018, Mangelsen learned he was positioned high enough on a hunting lottery to actually receive a hunting tag. The lottery is for hunting a grizzly bear in September through November. Mangelsen will be shooting the bruin with a camera, not a gun. Mangelsen is one of 7,000 people who could receive a tag. Then, in September just weeks before hunting season was to begin, a federal judge in Montana restored protection to all of the bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The judge ruled that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service officials were \\"arbitrary and capricious\\" when they removed protection from the bears under the Endangered Species Act. Recognition =Photography awards= In 1994 and 2000 Mangelsen won the British Broadcasting Corporation‚Äôs Wildlife Photographer of the Year Award. The North American Nature Photography Association honored him as the Outstanding Nature Photographer of the Year.

The spacecraft adheres to the 1U CubeSat standard and is currently in a 93¬∞ inclination orbit. DAVE will study the vibration of metal beams damped with tungsten particles in a micro-gravity environment. The test elements are driven by a piezoelectric actuator, and vibration data is collected via an accelerometer at the tip of each beam. DAVE was launched into a high- inclination orbit as a secondary payload on the final flight of the Delta II launch vehicle as part of the ELaNa-18 ride-share mission with NASA's ICESat-2 primary payload. The launch occurred out of Vandenberg Air Force Base, California on September 15 at 6:02 AM local time. DAVE was deployed alongside three other CubeSat spacecraft: University of Central Florida's SurfSat, and two ELFIN spacecraft from University of California, Los Angeles. As of November 2018, the spacecraft was active and in good health.  Design  DAVE is a 1U CubeSat spacecraft, measuring approximately 10x10x11cm. The spacecraft was integrated into a PPOD (Poly Picosatellite Orbital Deployer) alongside the University of Central Florida's SurfSat. Fixed solar panels on the sides of the spacecraft provide power to the avionics and transmitter. DAVE is operated from UHF ground stations at California Polytechnic State University. As the satellite's experiment is contained entirely within the spacecraft and does not require any external influence (other than the existence of the low-Earth orbit environment), DAVE contains no attitude control system. A deployable UHF dipole antenna was used to provide fairly omnidirectional coverage, negating the need for spacecraft pointing.  Payload  DAVE contains three aluminum beams which will be used to study the effects of microgravity on vibration damping. Each beam contains a mass on the tip which is attached to an accelerometer, used to identify the resonance peaks of each beam. One beam acts as an undamped control system, while the other two beams contain two types of tungsten particle dampers. Each beam is driven by a high-voltage piezoelectric element over a range of frequencies. The data from the vibration payload can be used to potentially develop systems to dampen out harmful vibrations on future spacecraft. Payload data is downlinked from the spacecraft and processed on the ground.  Amateur Radio Beacon  DAVE transmits a radio beacon on the amateur 70-centimeter band to allow ham radio operators to track and monitor the satellite. The beacon has been received and decoded by amateur radio operators internationally. The spacecraft transmits a periodic radio packet on 437.150 MHz, which contains sensor telemetry recorded just prior to the transmitter turning on. The beacon contains information from various sensors including temperature sensors, a magnetoresistive magnetometer, and voltage sensors on various electronics.

The airport will be built on a total of 698 acres. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) gave its clearance for the airport after visiting the site in May 2018. In August 2019, Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur requested the Fifteenth Finance Commission for a special purpose grant of Rs 2,000 crore towards construction of the airport for operation of wide-body aircraft. The AAI completed its Obstacle Limitation Surfaces survey for the project site in August 2019. The Ministry of Civil Aviation gave in-principle approval for the execution of the project with the help of the AAI in October 2019. In January 2020, AAI signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Himachal Pradesh Government to build and operate the airport through a Joint Venture Company. The airport will have a unidirectional runway, suitable for operation of aircraft up to ATR 72 initially. WAPCOS has been appointed as project consultant and has floated tenders for Environmental Impact Assessment for the project following a site visit in July 2020. The Himachal Pradesh government had first proposed an international greenfield airport in the Balh valley of Mandi district to the Union Civil Aviation ministry in 2008. Since the existing airports in the state at Kullu, Kangra and Shimla were only capable of handling small aircraft, the State government was keen to develop a bigger airport at Sundar Nagar that could cater to bigger aircraft and had offered land for the project.

It is closely related to the Alano Espa√±ol; however, the Spanish Dogo is larger. The Spanish Dogo is recognized by the Asociaci√≥n Canina Nacional and consequently by the Alianz Canine Worldwide. The largest populations of the Spanish Dogo are located in Andalusia and in Norway. The Spanish CNDE (Club Nacional del Dogo Espa√±ol) Club was founded in 2014 by forerunners of the breed and focuses on Spanish Dogo recovery. CNDE is headquartered in Seville, in the locality of Utrera. Club Nacional del Dogo Espa√±ol (C.N.D.E.)  History  At the end of the 4th century, the Alano people occupied large areas of southern Europe, including the Iberian peninsula. The Alano people were accompanied by their catch dogs, who mingled with the dogs brought to the peninsula by the Phoenicians and Romans. This mixture gave rise to what would later be called Dogos, Presas or Chatos espa√±ol. Its name is mainly due to its qualities in handling and controlling cattle of semi-wild type, coming from the Iberian peninsula. Later, the appearance of bullfighting offered them a prominent role in the so-called \\"dog luck\\" until the beginning of the 20th century. Due to its qualities for defense and guarding, the Dogo was used as a dog of war by military of other nations, particularly for the control of insurgidos in the Americas.  Description  = Appearance = The Dogo is a molosser-type breed that is strong with a straight and compact back. It has a remarkable sexual dimorphism; males have a more developed cranial region and a more marked type than females. From medium to large, brachycephalic, it presents a robust, compact and powerful structure. The jaws are large, with 42 teeth in a full set. The teeth are not visible with the mouth closed. The canine teeth are blunt, short, wide and well-separated. = Temperament = Spanish Dogos are known to be sweet and kind. They are tireless, multipurpose workers who are especially endowed for guarding, defense, handling and control of cattle due to their attentive natures. They tend to be very self-confident.

The Article 109 of the Constitution contained the description of the state emblem: The design of the actual emblem doesn't match with the constitution. Instead of a full inscription of the name of the ASSR, the abbreviation of the ASSR was abbreviated. The motto in the Udmurt language was depicted on the ribbon on the right, and in Russian on the left. = First revision = On May 31, 1978, the extraordinary IX session of the Supreme Soviet of the UASSR of the ninth adopted the new Constitution of the Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The article 157 of the constitution contained the description of the state emblem: In accordance with this description of the Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, the \\"Statute on the State Emblem of the Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\\" was approved. The name of the ASSR in Russian and Udmurt was depicted on the coat of arms in full words, rather than abbreviation. The motto in the Udmurt language was located on the red ribbon under the motto in Russian.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 January 2016.  History  The control tower sits among more modern hangars on the western side of the airport From the early 1950s the use of Bankstown Airport increased dramatically: annual movements rose from 100,000 to 280,000 between 1962 and 1967. By the mid-1960s, Bankstown was widely recognised as the headquarters of Australia's general aviation industry. Improvements to the airport over this period included: a sealed 941m-long runway (1952); a 1,190m-long sealed runway (1962); the installation of runway lighting (1965); and a third sealed runway (914m). On 5 July 1968, the Department of Civil Aviation announced that a new 60ft-high air traffic control tower, with associated powerhouse and equipment would be built at Bankstown (combined cost $250,000) on the western side of the airport, opposite the site of the Royal Australian Air Force control tower. In its siting and facilities the new tower conformed to Master Facility Schedule (MFS) no. 18 (issue 2, May 1967), specifying requirements for standard facilities in control towers and stating principles to be observed in the preparation of control tower unit facility schedules. The complex was commissioned in 1970.  Description  Bankstown Airport Air Traffic Control Tower occupies approximately on Tower Road, Bankstown Airport, comprising the air traffic control tower and its base building located within Land Parcel 17/DP1071297. The ATC tower, powerhouse and equipment room are located to the west of the airport. The complex is enclosed in a fence of cyclone and barbed wire, with a pedestrian entry to the north-west of the enclosure. Additions to the complex since the late-1960s include a single-storey, skillion-roofed extension that abuts the west end of the tower's south elevation (this building is not part of the ATC facility), and a satellite dish enclosure to the east, built in 1992. The floor of the cabin is above ground level. = Exterior = Bankstown ATC tower is composed of a square four-storey base in reinforced concrete with a face brick cladding, below a rectangular cantilevered walkway, also in reinforced concrete, around an octagonal cabin. The cabin is raised on a part-chamfered half-height duct and service space and octagonal cabin. The tower is built on standard raft footings, with a central stair in reinforced concrete. A single- storey brick wing (radio equipment room) extends westward from the tower base and a power house is located a short distance to the north. Both are original components of the ATC complex and appear to be intact externally. The first, second and third floor levels of the east elevation of the ATC tower, facing the apron, feature narrow horizontal metal-framed casement windows running almost the full width of the building. There are no openings to the ground floor, with the exception of a vent to the west. The windows to the first and second storeys feature three regularly spaced mullions. At third floor level these have been altered including the introduction of larger vertically oriented windows on the south side and possibly the replacement of the original framing. The south elevation is blank with no openings. A modern steel fire escape connects the walkway above to the ground level. The escape ladder appears to be of recent origins and may be a replacement for an earlier version (no escape ladder is indicated on the 1968 drawings). The west elevation, facing the road, features paired metal-framed casement windows lighting the internal stair. The main entrance to the building is on this side of the building and is via a simple timber door. The door is at the east end of a covered walkway formed by the overhanging eave of the radio equipment room, whose east elevation abuts the tower base. There is no internal connection between the two. As for the south elevation, the north elevation is blank other than for access doors to the air conditioning plant room at ground floor level. Above third floor level the walkway around the base of the cabin (at crawl space level) is enclosed with original painted steel balustrading. The flooring is a waterproof membrane. The cabin windows are double-glazed and canted outward. In the event of an emergency, the three windows facing west can be opened externally, by means of a hydraulically operated mechanism mounted on the west-facing facet of the crawl space wall. The rooftop features a central mounted beacon, and various antennae and aerials. Like the walkway, it is enclosed with linked steel gate panels clipped together. = Interior = As built, the tower accommodated a switch room and technical officer's room on the first floor; the office of the officer-in-charge and check controller's room on the second floor; and a staff locker room and toilets/showers on the third floor. Floors throughout were vinyl tiles, and concrete walls were painted white. There have been very few modifications to the building's interior. The bulk (approximately 60 per cent) of the ground floor plan is dedicated to the air conditioning plant room, which is separated from the entrance lobby by a load-bearing concrete wall painted white. The concrete floor of the entrance lobby is finished in vinyl tiles, as are the treads of the concrete staircase that runs the height of the building. The balustrades throughout are white-painted metal, with the handrail coated in black plastic. The ground floor is higher than levels 1-3, possibly to accommodate the air conditioning plant, or for the height of the cabin to achieve the required sightlines over the apron. The layout of the first, second and third floors are almost identical. A doorway to the east of the staircase leads to a lobby area that provides access to two rooms facing east. On the second and third levels there is a small store in the north-west corner, accessed from the lobby. On the first floor, a locker room has been built into this space (which was originally open), accessed through a fire door in the plaster partition wall at the top of the stairs. Duct voids are located to the north and south walls. The toilets and showers on the third floor were upgraded in 2004/05. A flight of stairs from the third floor leads to the duct and walkway level. A door to the left of the stairs leads to a galley kitchen with a half-height door (to the duct space) to the east and a full-height door (to the walkway) to the west. With the exception of upgrades to finishes and fabric, and modifications to accommodate technical changes, the control cabin is intact as built. The frame of the central timber console is original. The canted double glazed cavity windows are lined with felt. Demisting is by electrical metal heaters mounted at the base of the double glazing. The ceiling treatment of acoustic tiles is original. The circular visor track is extant, with the screen removed. Sun shading is now provided by pull down blinds fixed to the top of each of the windows. The floor is carpeted; the carpet may conceal the original rubber tiles. Archive photography dated 1974 appear to show the walls finished in perforated plasterboard; this may be concealed behind the present carpet. A metal safety bar has been installed at the top of the stairs. = Condition = The ATC tower and cabin are largely intact as constructed. The only change to the exterior is the modification of the third floor windows on the east elevation. The interior is likewise intact in both plan form and fabric, albeit with minor upgrades. The cabin is an authentic Department of Civil Aviation standard issue control cabin c. late-1960s. It includes the original console, which has been modified to accommodate upgrades and later technologies. The acoustic treatments to the walls, ceiling and floor are extant. The associated equipment room and power house also appear to be intact, at least externally.  Heritage listing  Bankstown Airport Air Traffic Control Tower was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 January 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion D: Characteristic values Bankstown Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower is of historical significance in a national context as a representative and substantially intact example of a standardised air traffic control tower form dating from the first phase of post-World War II design in air traffic control facilities (1950s-late 1960s). The Bankstown air traffic control tower, together with its equipment room and powerhouse, was designed by the Australian Government's Department of Works (NSW branch) for the Department of Civil Aviation. The complex was commissioned in 1970. The control tower is a utilitarian design comprising a square four-storey base in reinforced concrete with a face brick cladding, below a rectangular cantilevered walkway, also in reinforced concrete, around an octagonal cabin. The cabin is raised on a part-chamfered half-height duct and service space and octagonal cabin. Bankstown is one of a group of control towers built essentially to the same operational and technical standards and specifications across Australia and Papua New Guinea from the 1950s until the late-1960s, when perimeter frame towers became the standard model for control towers at secondary and general aviation airports in Australia. Its design is derived from the 1950s air traffic control towers (Essendon, Hobart, Launceston and others), a design approach that was repeated and refined through the 1960s. While a late example of this standard type, Bankstown is distinguished from the majority of other surviving comparisons through its relative intactness. Other than for the modification of windows at the upper level on the eastern elevation, the building is intact externally; internally it also retains the majority of its plan form and fabric. It is unusual in retaining its original timber-framed console, albeit modified. The associated radio equipment room and power house are also intact externally.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012.  History  In the early 1800s swimming at Sydney's beaches was considered to be a controversial pastime, although becoming more popular by mid-century. In this period, Bondi Beach was seen as being too remote from central Sydney. By the 1900s, however, restrictive attitudes to swimming began to relax and the beach became associated with healthy recreation and leisure activities. Bondi Beach was also declared a \\"public beach\\" in the 1880s, and the first tramway reached the beach in this period. Bondi Beach became a popular attraction for families and recreational swimmers. Waverley Municipal Council built the first surf bathing sheds in the early 1900s, and the famous Bondi Pavilion in 1929. By the 1930s Bondi was drawing not only local visitors but also people from elsewhere in Australia and overseas. As Bondi grew in popularity as a popular surfing beach in the interwar period, so did the development and suburbanisation of the area. The Bondi Beach Post Office was erected in 1922, at the time the area was growing and developing. The architectural design is attributed to EH Henderson of the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways, under the supervision of George Oakeshott. Additions to the Hall Street section of the building were undertaken in 1934. The Oakeshott-Henderson designed post offices for the Australian Department of Works and Railways appeared in regional and suburban locations in New South Wales in the early 1920s. These represented the takeover by the Australian Government of a previously New South Wales Government architects' preserve, but in a manner varyingly distinct from the Murdoch-Mackennal flavoured incursions in other states. Bondi Beach, in particular, concentrated its entry in a smaller and tighter corner placement, angled and hemmed in by two flanking columns. The three most direct counterparts for Bondi beach were at Waverley (1923), the plainer Beecroft (1925) and Coffs Harbour Jetty (1926). These all incorporated the Commonwealth institutional signature of brick rustication in their piers, but differed in the general pattern of smaller Australian post offices in other respects. In this Bondi Beach reflected the generally small, tight proportioning becoming widespread in New South Wales housing and small institutional buildings, partly due to distinctively small property divisions and all being in brick. Examples are at Wallandbeen (1915), Warren (1916), Weston (1916), Botany (1917) and Kendall (c. 1921). Where any sites were broader, New South Wales post offices invariably shifted to the \\"Queensland\\" dual entrance breakfront pattern on Murdoch-Mackennal lines and developed earlier in other states. In New South Wales these appeared at Holbrook (1920), Gordon (1922), Grenfell (c. 1923), Broadmeadow (1924) and Dunedoo (1925). This period also saw a gradual shift toward square footprint designs with symmetrical pyramid or hipped roof designs such as Yenda (1920), Killara (1923), Roseville (1924, the very similar Lawson (1925), the in antis columned Merewether (1925), Millthorpe (1927), and the round-arched pair at Rose Bay (1928) and Concord (1930). There were smaller post offices with asymmetrical elevations but still square-roof plans and footprints. These included Belmore (1925), Branxton and Bulli (both 1926), Kandos and Yanco (both 1927). These symmetrical roofed post offices found close counterparts interstate as at Glen Iris in Victoria or Nundah in Queensland (1928-30). These were in addition to the more general breakfront post offices that marked the Commonwealth dominance of post office design after c. 1920. These in effect also marked the high tide of Neo-Georgian pavilion post offices in Australia, though Old Colonial and Georgian revivalism had been evident in Government architectural thinking long before that (e.g. Armidale, 1880-1916). Of the post offices referred to in the above analysis, only the Bondi Beach post office and Botany (NSW), Rose Bay (NSW), Nundah (Qld) and Armidale (NSW) remain in Australia Post ownership.  Description  Bondi Beach Post Office is at 20 Hall Street, corner Jaques Avenue, Bondi, comprising the whole of Lot 2 DP329116. Located on the corner of Hall Street and Jacques Avenue, the post office displays some landmark qualities in this context. The building has an assured corner presentation, makes a contribution to the local/immediate streetscape heritage character, and accordingly demonstrates aesthetic value at a local level. Jacques Avenue and Hall Street are linked, compositionally, by a diagonally angled entry porch with a flat aluminium-surfaced roof that is concealed from view from the street by a parapet. The entry is framed by a pair of Tuscan columns and a cement rendered entablature, extended around the street elevations as a cornice. A cement rendered plinth also runs around the street elevations, turning into two pedestals either side of the porch to support the flanking columns. Both street frontages of the original building have three sets of double-hung sash windows divided by brick pilasters with rendered capitals and bases, and with each pair separated by a set of broader piers in exposed face brick, each pier rusticated in the Australian Post Office \\"signature\\" style developed by Murdoch and Mackennal around 1909-10 in Victoria. The later addition facing Hall Street has repeated this treatment (see below). A subsequent addition facing Jacques Avenue has only two double- hung sash windows, which are sympathetic. The interior of the former corner porch has been enclosed to form the Postal Manager's office, and is accessed from the retail area. The porch in its original configuration was probably cement rendered and lit by small rectangular windows facing Hall Street and Jacques Avenue. The entablature above the former porch is inscribed Post Office and both the Jacques Avenue and Hall Street continuation of the entablature were inscribed \\"Bondi Beach\\". An additional entry to the post hall was on the Hall Street elevation, flanked by two rendered pilasters. This is part of a later addition. The eaves were boxed with planking transverse to the streets; the gutters and downpipes are copper. The window sills were bull- nosed in a standard domestic manner. Inside, the plaster and beam ceilings were intact as late as 1990, though the Valuation Report notes the ceilings as being currently in painted plasterboard. A large west end addition was made in 1934, facing Hall Street, designed by H Sturtevant during C Todd's period as Commonwealth Works Director. Sturtevant re-used original west-facing windows and carefully matched existing base and cornice lines. An alcove in the porch was fitted with public phone booths but now forms a storeroom. The base of the porch has been altered to a slight incline to provide disabled access to the building, and this porch has a roller shutter fitted across its opening. Steel mesh fencing has been erected in front of the small yard and loading dock facing Jacques Avenue. A postal box porch on the Jacques Avenue elevation and telephone booths in front of the same elevation, have diminished the building's integrity. It is unclear if this post office had associated residential quarters as many others did. = Key areas/elements = * Compact domestic scale and massing * Corner presentation with some landmark qualities = Condition = When last inspected, the building was in fair condition. Externally it was relatively intact, but internally the building has a relatively low level of intactness. = Original fabric = The original fabric of the building that still exists includes: * Structural frame: reinforced concrete footings. Timber floor in retail area and concrete floor slab elsewhere. * External walls: face brick and cement render in finish; load-bearing masonry. * Internal walls: stud frame clad in painted plasterboard or fibrous plaster. * Floor: reinforced concrete with carpet and vinyl cladding to the back areas and timber floor finished in carpet in retail and some office areas, a vinyl tiled lunchroom and storage area, and ceramic tiles in the wet areas. * Ceiling: painted plasterboard and probably painted fibrous plaster in places. In the rear back office area there is a suspended ceiling. Air conditioning ducts flush-mounted in retail space. * Roof: timber frame; terra-cotta tile cladding with aluminium membrane-clad flat roof above entry porch.  Heritage listing  Bondi Beach Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Bondi Beach Post Office, constructed in 1922 to a design by EH Henderson of the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways, and subsequently extended, is of local historic value. The building is associated with a period of local growth and development, in the interwar period, when Bondi Beach became a popular beach resort and attraction for families and recreational swimmers. The famous beach pavilion was constructed in 1929, and by the 1930s Bondi was drawing local and international visitors. As Bondi grew in popularity, so did the development and suburbanisation of the area. The interwar heritage character of the building, reflecting this important period of local development, and the building's prominent corner location, enhance this aspect of significance. Criterion D: Characteristic values Bondi Beach Post Office is an example of a: * post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) * interwar period building in the Colonial/Georgian Revival Style * building by E H Henderson, Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways, under direction of George Oakeshott Typologically, the building's original planning has been impacted by the enclosure of the former corner porch, to form the Postal Manager's office; an additional entry to the postal hall was located on the Hall Street elevation, now part of the later addition made in 1934 by H Sturtevant. A postal box porch on the Jaques Avenue elevation and telephone booths in front of the same elevation, have also impacted on the building's presentation. Stylistically and architecturally, Bondi Beach is typical of a small group of compact, domestically scaled brick post offices in New South Wales designed by E H Henderson under George Oakshott's aegis as State head of the Commonwealth Public Works office. It also reflects and develops several design signatures worked out by Murdoch and Mackennal in other states. The building is also one of four still operating as a post office designed between 1923 and 1926 that adopt a columned corner entry in a tight domestic cottage-form, and were a genre distinct to New South Wales. More formally, it is a companion design of the pyramidal or oblong hipped- roofed post offices designed for small suburban and regional settings between 1920 and 1930, which again had their main airing in New South Wales, but were tried out in other states as well. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Bondi Beach Post Office, located on the corner of Hall Street and Jacques Avenue, displays some landmark qualities in this context. The building has an assured corner presentation, makes a contribution to the local/immediate streetscape heritage character, and accordingly demonstrates aesthetic value at a local level.

After launching, the PLATO WA website quickly became one of the most widely read educational websites in Australia with more 180,000 hits per month and contained an archive of more than 10,000 articles on the subject of OBE implementation. The role of PLATO in leading public opinion against OBE was acknowledged in many academic papers on the subject.  Background  Outcomes Based Education was an education philosophy that influenced national and state educational policies from the early 1990s. Western Australia‚Äôs experience commenced with the development of the 1999 Curriculum Framework which became mandatory for all schools in the state. PLATO was formed on 14 June 2004 by high school science teacher Marko Vojkovic in response to the increased efforts of the state government to implement an Outcomes Based Education system in schools. In May 2006 retired Professor Steve Kessell stated that the teachers who opposed OBE where not a handful of troublemakers, but the overwhelming majority. On 14 June 2006 they were involved in an anti-OBE rally at Parliament House. Education Minister Ljiljanna Ravlich was a particular target of PLATO. Following her demotion in 2006, Western Australia's OBE curriculum was subjected to parliamentary inquiry. In 2008 it was officially abandoned by the state government with Minister for Education Mark McGowan remarking that the 1990s fad \\"to dispense with syllabus\\" was over. That same year PLATO supported the approach of the proposed Australian National Curriculum. PLATO WA inspired a similar lobby group in Queensland called PLATO QLD.

It was the first species to be designated as part of the genus Uncinocarpus, owing in part to its characteristic development of hooked (uncinate) appendages. As the closest non-pathogenic relative of Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii, it has become a subject of research interest. History and taxonomy U. reesii was first recognized under the name Gymnoascus uncinatus by German taxonomist Michael Emil Eduard Eidam in 1893. The species is named after Robert Rees, an Australian mycologist who provided isolates of G. uncinatus to Lynne Sigler and G.F. Orr, who in 1976 proposed the re-designation of this species as the first a new genus: Uncinocarpus. This redesignation was based largely in part due to the species' characteristic development of hooked and spiralling appendages, which were not present in any other species of Gymnoascus. Since becoming the first species of the genus Uncinocarpus, others have joined it, including U. uncinatus and U. orissi. After the advent of high-throughput gene sequencing in the 1990s, genomic studies provided evidence demonstrating that U. reesii was the closest known non-pathogenic relative of Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii, marking the point of divergence from which the pathogenic highly pathogenic Onygenaceae evolved.Strain UAMH 160 grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) at 40 C for 16 days Growth and morphology In culture, colonies of U. reesii grow moderately fast and are yellowish-white to buff in colour, are flat and dense in shape, and range from velvety to powdery in texture. Arthroconidia of U. reesii tend to be broad compared to most Malbranchea, ranging from approximately 2.5-3.5 Œºm x 3.5-6 Œºm in size. As a heterothallic species, two compatible \\"sexes\\" are required for sexual reproduction to occur. As with other members of the genus Uncinocarpus, U. reesii can develop hooked (uncinate) appendages on vegetative hyphae. These appendages are short and rigid, with thick walls approximately 8.8Œºm in diameter. Appendage length rarely exceeds the diameter of the fruiting body (ascocarp). These appendages are found in the asexual stage as extensions of vegetative hyphae, but only develop fertile spore-bearing structures (gymnothecia) in the sexual morph when compatible strains are mated. The gymnothecia are reddish-brown, initially formed on short, bulbous stalks before becoming more or less spherical. The ascospores are smooth, oblate and hole-filled (punctate). When the asexual morph of U. reesii develops these hooked appendages, they are referred to as \\"pseudogymnothecia\\", due to their similar appearance but lack of a spore-bearing structure. In lieu of spores, the asexual form produces arthroconidia that are cylindrical shaped with flattened ends. Physiology U. reesii is capable of growing on many different amino acids, but comparatively fewer carbohydrates. In general, growth substrates with a high protein content are most conducive to its growth. U. reesii is capable of digesting keratin, and grows well in soil rich in animal matter, such as skin and hair. Though less commonly observed, U. reesii can survive, at least transiently, in the human and animal tissue. Its growth is strongly to moderately inhibited at 37 ¬∞C. U. reesii is also capable of digesting cellulose, basic plant sugars and cell wall components, allowing it to degrade plant materials in the surrounding soil. Though U. reesii can digest both protein and animal matter, its superior growth on high protein substances has led researchers to suggest that this ability to transfer from soil to living host gave rise to the ability of its descendants in the family Onygenales to colonize animals and cause disease. Habitat and pathogenicity In the natural environment, U. reesii is commonly found growing in soil and on keratinous materials, and is found over a wide geographic range. Though there are no recorded cases of disease caused by U. reesii, there is evidence to support the hypothesis that the species is the root of the evolutionary branch from which pathogenic species in the Onygenales arose. The ability of U. reesii to shift from plant to animal substrates are theorized to have led to development of pathogenicity in several Coccidioides and Paracoccidioides species, both of which are highly genetically similar to U. reesii. Another related Uncinocarpus species, U. orissi, has been implicated in one deep skin infection and two pulmonary infections of humans.

The shooters killed 25 people, including soldiers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and civilian bystanders. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Iran since the Chabahar suicide bombing in December 2010. The Ahwaz National Resistance claimed responsibility in the name of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA), and the Amaq News Agency attributed it to followers of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Both claims were rejected by the ASMLA. An ISIL spokesman later claimed responsibility and warned of further attacks.

Retrieved 26 September 2018. On 1 October 2018, in retaliation for the attacks, Iranian Revolutionary Guards fired missiles and carried out drone attacks in Abu Kamal of Syria targeting \\"militants in Syria it blamed for an attack\\", Sepah News reported. Attack The parade was part of an annual commemoration known as the Sacred Defence Week commemorating the start of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in 1980. It included the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps marching along Quds Boulevard in Ahvaz. Five gunmen began shooting at the parade from a nearby park on 22 September 2018 at 09:00 local time, wearing military uniforms and disguised as Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and Basiji (volunteers); they also targeted a viewing stand and civilian bystanders. The attack lasted about ten minutes. Casualties The attackers killed 25 people, including 12 soldiers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and a four-year-old boy, with 70 others left wounded, including children. Many were taken to hospital in critical condition. However, according to CNN, at least 29 people died in the Ahvaz military parade attack. Initial reports conflicted; Iranian state media said all four assailants had been killed, while local deputy governor Ali Hosein Hoseinzadeh said two were arrested. According to senior spokesman Brigadier General Abolfazl Shekarchi, senior spokesman for Iran's armed forces, \\"All four terrorists were quickly neutralised by security forces\\". Iran news agency‚Äôs reports showed that three out of the four assailants were shot dead during the attack whereas the fourth died shortly later in the hospital, according to The Guardian. In a subsequent report, Fars News Agency said a fifth assailant was also killed but was initially mixed up with the victims.  Responsibility  Iranian state media initially reported that \\"takfiri gunmen\\" executed the assault. A splinter group of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA) was the first to claim responsibility for the terrorist attack; Yaqoob Al-Ahvaz claimed responsibility in comments to United Kingdom-based Iran International TV. He said that his group Ahvaz National Resistance has \\"no choice but to resist\\". A statement on the ASMLA website on 23 September denied responsibility for the attack, saying that the claim was made by a \\"group that was expelled from the organization since 2015\\". Amaq News Agency claimed that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant was responsible and posted videos of three men discussing the upcoming attack. Two spoke Arabic and one spoke Persian. On 26 September, ISIL's Al Furqan Media Foundation, which publishes official announcements from ISIL leaders, published an audio statement titled \\"The Muwahhidin's Assault on the Tower of the Mushrikin\\" from spokesman Abul-Hasan Al-Muhajir, which claimed \\"A group of men of the Khilafah and guardians of the creed in the land of Persia have pounced in defense of the religion, acting to deter and suppress their enemy and to fulfill the Islamic State's promise to all who have the blood of Ahlus Sunnah on their hands.\\" On 27 September, ISIL's newspaper al-Naba released what it claimed were photos of the five masked attackers. Reactions The Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei wrote on his website: \\"This crime is a continuation of the plots of the regional states that are puppets of the United States, and their goal is to create insecurity in our dear country.\\" He also called on security forces to bring those responsible to justice. Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked the governments of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Denmark to \\"condemn the attack and extradite people linked to it to Iran to be put on trial.\\" British ambassador to Iran Rob Macaire condemned the attack and sent his nation's condolences to the victims' families. On 23 September, the Iranian ministry summoned the United Arab Emirates' charg√© d'affaires in Iran over a tweet made by Emirati professor Abdulkhaleq Abdulla about the attack which said: \\"A military attack against a military target is not a terrorist act and moving the battle to the Iranian side is a declared option\\". Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said that Abdulla's comments were \\"irresponsible and thoughtless\\" and \\"could hold Abu Dhabi accountable\\". Khamenei alleged that the people responsible for the attack were paid by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The UAE has denied Iranian allegations that it had any links with the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he was horrified and presented his condolences, while the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned the attack and warned those who finance terrorism in the region. Pakistan also condemned the attack through their foreign office's spokesman Mohammad Faisal.

The main focus of the group was to maintain awareness of the desaparecidos in the public eye, and to pressure the government to release information about them. The goals and pressure brought to bear by the Association played an influential role in the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the reestablishment of democracy in Chile and the 1989 election of President Patricio Aylwin.  Background  On a military junta toppled President Salvador Allende in a coup d'√©tat and installed General Augusto Pinochet as head of the new regime. This was a dictatorial, authoritarian regime which trampled on human rights with the use of torture, disappearances, illegal and secret arrest, and extrajudicial killings. Thousands were being detained, and hundreds killed by the regime. It was in this context, that the first opposition to the Pinochet regime appeared in 1973, when several religious groups led by the Archdiocese of Santiago organized the Committee of Cooperation for Peace in Chile in 1973 in order to support human rights of those persecuted by the regime of General Augusto Pinochet. Women of the Association of Families of the Detained-Disappeared demonstrate in front of La Moneda Palace during the Pinochet military regime.  Founding  At the end of 1974, a group of mostly women applied to the Committee of Cooperation for Peace in Chile to find out the whereabouts of their missing family members, the desaparecidos (Engl: the disappeared), who had been detained or killed by the brutal Pinochet regime. The new Association coalesced unofficially out of this group of people. Clotario Blest formally established the Association of Families of the Detained-Disappeared in 1975 out of his home in central Santiago. Memorial to the desaparecidos in the Cementerio General de Santiago  Activities  After the opening of the notorious detention centers like Tres √Ålamos failed to produce any leads about their missing kin, they staged several hunger strikes to pressure the government into giving out information. In 1978, UNICEF and the Catholic Church became involved, and sent information about 613 cases to the Ministry of the Interior but there was no reply. In December, bodies of some of the desaparecidos were found in Lonqu√©n. They had been seen being taken away by uniformed men in 1973. In February 1979, the group made a pilgrimage to the site where the bodies had been found. In order to try to pressure the government to release information, members of the group chained themselves to the fence of the National Congress, where the Ministry of Justice was located. There was no response from the government.  Return to Democracy  The Chilean return to democracy culminated in March 1990 with the election of Patricio Aylwin as President. The Association was represented in the ceremonies on inauguration day, March 11, 1990, and in the celebrations at the National Stadium of Chile the next day. The pressure they applied for information about the desparecidos played a key role in the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission under the new administration. During the period of military rule under the Pinochet government, the Association never ceased searching for information about the detention and destiny of their family members, in the face of continual silence or rebuffs from the government. With the advent of democracy, this goal did not change but now that they had a democratically elected president sympathetic to their goals, the focus of how best to achieve their goals shifted. Both the Association and the new government sought a public airing of the facts of disappearances as state policy during the Pinochet years, establishment of human rights as a basic value and distinguishing factor between dictatorship and democracy. But they didn't agree on how best to advance and balance the goals of truth and justice. In addition to continuing their public demonstrations to raise and maintain awareness, they now also held meetings with high officials, including Justice Minister Cumplido, Interior Minister Krauss, and President Aylwin. Aylwin strongly supported the Commission, which exposed the government's brutal repression of its citizens during the military dictatorship.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  An unofficial post office was opened at Botany in 1881, as the area maintained a small population throughout the 1880s. Large scale subdivision and settlement of land eventually occurred in the 1890s, with a town hall built in 1899. At that time, the postal facility was transferred to the new town hall in Botany Road, a little to the south of the current post office building. After World War I, commercial expansion generally took place along Botany Road. About two decades later, the local municipal council lobbied for a new purpose-built post office, and accordingly approached the Postmaster General's Department. A new building was constructed on a site in Banksia Street. The date of construction for the current building has variously been attributed to 1917Warmington and Ward and 1923.National Archives post office plans If the first date is correct, the Botany Post Office would be one of the earliest designed and constructed by the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways in New South Wales after assuming that responsibility (the states generally continued to design and build post offices up until 1916). However, given the later date is more likely, the post office would still be one of a series of comparatively early post offices built by the Commonwealth in the state. Although George Oakeshott was the architect in charge of Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways, the architect who actually designed the building was probably E. J. Henderson who had designed a number of post office buildings. In May 1939, the post office was robbed by breaking into the strongroom by blasting a gelignite charge, which created three loud explosions. Having obtained access to the safe, the men stole ¬£50 worth of cash, postal notes and stamps, and well as other items in the post office to the value of ¬£260. Although local residents saw the incident, they only watched on as they were too afraid to notify the police. Three men were subsequently arrested, but only one was found guilty and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment and the other two men were acquitted.  Description  Botany Post Office is at 2 Banksia Street, corner Nilsson Lane, Botany, comprising the whole of Lot 1 DP208627. This is the third site of Botany's Post Office, on the northeast corner of Banksia Street and Nilsson Lane, c. 50m east of Botany Road, the main commercial street of the suburb. The exterior of Botany Post Office This building was the first purpose-built post office for Botany, and claimed as the first NSW post office built to Commonwealth architects' designs.Warmington and Ward (1992, v. 4) Its external detail and finish was broadly Neo-Georgian and Colonial Revival in the manner suggested in William Hardy Wilson's well-known local designs of 1913 (Eryldene) or 1916 (Purulia), with a hipped terracotta roof in Marseilles- pattern tile (probably not original), boxed eaves, double-hung sash windows that have six-paned upper sashes, cement rendered external walls and Tuscan pillars framing the entries and four others flanking the windows of the retail space. The columnar motif in groupings or suggested groupings of four was an established signature in Murdoch and Mackennal's smaller Victorian post offices and was to some extent a carry-over from earlier Murdoch designs in Queensland such as Roma Courthouse. The public area was placed under a hipped breakfront and accessed from porch entries to either side, on the well- established Queensland and Victorian pattern. At some stage since its completion, the southwest porch's entrance has been boarded-in, and incorporated into the retail space. This porch's plaster ceiling finish is extant and visible within the retail space. The design is more like a residential-cottage in scale and demeanour than the monumentalised and usually elevated masonry post offices in Queensland and Victoria. The PO box area is located inside the remaining porch and also in an addition towards the rear of the building. A concrete driveway was added later to a car park area at the rear. This area was later fenced with galvanised chain link and steel tubing. A small front yard or garden area is in front of the entry side, and this may have been a lawn at some point. It is now brick paved in zigzag patterning, probably dating from the mid-1980s. A set of public phone booths was installed on the left front, along with a concrete framed park bench (later replaced with a lighter metal structure). Several additions have been made to the rear of the post office. A space now used as a lunchroom between the building's two toilets was probably the rear verandah of the original building, but has now been enclosed by an addition. A low ramp access has been fitted to the northeast porch and a metal frame glazed door has replaced the original doors. The windows have all been barred apart from those to the porch still in use at the northeast corner. The battened board ceiling remains in the retail space, but elsewhere ceilings are of more recent origin. The original lighting in the retail space was replaced with suspended fluorescent units. Ducted reverse- cycle air conditioning has replaced or supplanted the window-mounted units, except in the former mail sorting room at the rear, which retains a wall- mounted air conditioner. The original public space probably had timber and glass partitions in the usual Federal manner, but has largely been opened up into an \\"office landscape\\" with screens and linked areas, as in the fused retail and mail room areas, but some lightweight timber and plasterboard partitions remain including one that separates the retail space from the manager's office. The northeast porch has been partially glazed in recent decades. Originally all window framing were dark, presumably polished timber but now are painted in a shade of white, and the remainder of the building is painted in light grey, with some elements including eaves painted in dark grey. The porch roofs are flat, as in the two Bondi Post Offices of this general period. = Condition = The overall condition is good given the building's age. Alterations and additions have been mainly built at the rear of the post office. The post office is relatively intact to its interior. Various additions towards the rear of the building, including a mail sorting room and post office box porch in an addition of lightweight timber construction, and minor alterations throughout, all of which are of relatively recent origin.  Heritage listing  Botany Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Botany Post Office, constructed in 1923, is of significance as one of a series of comparatively early post offices built by the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways in New South Wales after assuming that responsibility (the states generally continued to design and build post offices up until 1916). The overall level of intactness enhances this value. Criterion D: Characteristic values Botany Post Office is an example of: * post office and telegraph office of second generation typology (1870-1929), not incorporating quarters * Neo- Georgian/Colonial domestic revival architectural style * the design work of the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways with George Oakeshott as architect in charge and EJ Henderson, as the probable design architect. Botany Post Office is a small post office from the interwar era, associated with the early phase of Commonwealth Government designs in NSW institutional buildings. Typologically, it contained (and retains) a post office and postal functions. It is also comparatively intact externally (save for rear works and additions), and internally. Architecturally and stylistically, the design is interesting in its determinedly domestic scale and demeanour, and for its marked stylistic and thematic affinity with Hardy Wilson's early institutional buildings. The cottage form and domestic scaling in fact receive a determined expression with this post office, in comparison with the still monumental designs for Queensland and Victoria. It is also testament to the power of Colonial Revivalism and Neo-Georgian as a sensibility in Australian architecture, and occurs comparatively early in post-Federation applications of this mode to small public and commercial buildings. Given the domestic focus in later Sydney architecture the domesticity of smaller institutional designs, such as Botany Post Office, is of considerable interest. Criterion G: Social value The post office has been in operation for approximately 90 years, and has provided postal services and facilities to the local community for that period.

The Evacuation of Novorossiysk (–ù–æ–≤–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è —ç–≤–∞–∫—É–∞—Ü–∏—è) or the Novorossiysk Catastrophe (–ù–æ–≤–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è –∫–∞—Ç–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–∞) was the evacuation of the White Armed Forces of South Russia and refugees from Novorossiysk in March 1920, during the Russian Civil War, in which thousands of officers, soldiers and Cossacks of the White Army and civilians were left behind and killed by the Red Army and the Green Army. In total, some 33,000 people were executed.  Chronology of events  Denikin on the Russian destroyer Captain Saken during the Novorossiysk evacuation, March 1920 White troops during the Novorossiysk evacuation, March 1920 Russian refugees on Red Cross Relief Ship Sangamon, Novorossiysk, March 1920By March 11, 1920, the front line was only away from Novorossiysk. The Don and Kuban Armies, which were disorganized by that time, withdrew in great disorder. The line of defense was only held by the remnants of the Volunteer Army, which had been reduced and renamed to the Volunteer Corps, and which had great difficulty in containing the onslaught of the Red Army. The Cossacks failed to reach Taman, and as a result many of them ended up in Novorossiysk with the sole purpose of getting on a ship. In total, the Armed Forces in the South of Russia in the Novorossiysk area on the eve of the evacuation amounted to 25,200 bayonets and 26,700 sabers. Meanwhile, there were not enough ships in the harbour. Some of them were late due to stormy weather, while others were unable to arrive on time due to quarantines established in foreign ports. All ships arriving from Russia with refugees were kept in quarantine for a long time, because of the terrible typhus epidemic in Russia. The command ordered the immediate loading of the wounded and sick soldiers, but this order was never carried out. Moreover, military forces flocking to Novorossiysk began to occupy ships on their own, and officials cared more about the evacuation of property that could be sold after the war. On March 11, General George Milne, Commander-in-Chief of the British troops in the region, and Admiral Seymour, Commander of the Black Sea Fleet, arrived from Constantinople in Novorossiysk. General Anton Denikin was told that only 5,000-6,000 people could be evacuated by the British. At night, British naval vessels opened fire for the first time towards the mountains surrounding Novorossiysk. The shelling was provoked by the fact that Green soldiers had broken into the city prison and released several hundred prisoners, which fled with them into the mountains. On March 13, the first signs of panic appeared. On March 16, the South Russian Government was disbanded. On March 17, Yekaterinodar was taken by the Red Army. On March 22, around 22:00 hours, the Red Army occupied the Abinsk station and moved further towards Novorossiysk. The roads were crammed with carts, cars and military equipment left behind in the impassable mud. Only the railway remained open for movement, and it was used by Denikin's staff train, accompanied by armored trains. The plan was to get the troops in the harbour sent off to the Crimea, while horses and artillery were to be left behind. Parts of the Red Army under command of Semyon Budyonny also used the railway, leaving behind their heavy weapons and artillery. On March 25, 1920, parts of the Red Army, with the help of partisans, cashed the Volunteers from the Tunnelnaya station and crossed the pass into Gaiduk, a suburb of Novorossiysk. This blocked the railway tracks and forced the White Guards to leave their three armored trains behind here. On the night of March 26, in Novorossiysk warehouses were burning, and tanks with oil and shells were exploding. The evacuation was conducted under the cover of the second battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Edmund Hakewill-Smith and the Allied squadron commanded by Admiral Seymour, which fired towards the mountains, preventing the Reds from approaching the city. At dawn on March 26, the last ship, the Italian transport Baron Beck entered the Tsemessky Bay, causing great turmoil as the people didn't know where it would land. The panic reached its apogee when the crowd rushed to the gangway of this last ship. The military and civilian refugees on the transport ships were taken to the Crimea, Constantinople, Lemnos, the Prince Islands, Serbia, Cairo, and Malta. On March 27, the Red Army entered the city. The Don, Kuban, and Terek regiments, left on the shore, had no choice but to accept the terms and surrender to the Red Army.  Massacre of prisoners  Many of the officers of the Armed Forces of the South of Russia left in Novorossiysk committed suicide, not wanting to be captured, and many of those who became prisoners were later executed.  Consequences  About 40,000 soldiers were evacuated by Russian and Allied ships, without horses or any heavy equipment, while about 20,000 men were left behind and either dispersed or were captured by the Red Army. Following the disastrous Novorossiysk evacuation, Denikin stepped down and the military council elected Pyotr Wrangel as the new Commander-in-Chief of the White Army.  Involvement of officials  The last commander of Novorossiysk (from February to March 1920) was Major-General Alexei Korvin-Krukovsky. The commission that organized the evacuation was headed by General Alexander Kutepov. At the last moment (after March 20), the chief of the communications service, Major-General M. M. Ermakov, was engaged in the evacuation of troops to the Crimea. The chief of the Black Sea province and the department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the South-Russian government was N. S. Karinsky.

He poisoned six people, including his wife and daughter.  Preparing for the murders  Between 2001 and 2002, the Yaroslavl resident became seriously interested in the effect of poisons on humans. \\"I was interested that you can kill a man and leave no traces\\", Solovyov later said during the investigation.–ú–∞–Ω—å—è–∫- –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å —Å–≤—ë–ª –≤ –º–æ–≥–∏–ª—É –¥–≤—É—Ö –∂—ë–Ω, –¥–æ—á—å –∏ —Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è –º–∏–ª–∏—Ü–∏–∏ // –ö–æ–º—Å–æ–º–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞ The investigators believed that he could drew interest from the film \\"The Young Poisoner's Handbook\\", based on the biography of poisoner Graham Young, then proceeded to search for the poison - he studied special literature, searched for information on the Internet, tried to synthesize the poison from the originating plant, but did not succeed. Subsequently, according to the prosecutor's office, he bought at one of the regional enterprises a number of toxic metal salts, including 400 grams of thallium sulfate, which would later be used for the murders.–í—ã–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω –ø—Ä–∏–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä –∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—é –Ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏, –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–≤–∏–≤—à–µ–º—É 6 —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫ // –ù–æ–≤–∞—è –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞ The investigation could not establish from where Solovyov bought the poison.–Ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –º–∞–Ω—å—è–∫- –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å —Å—Ç–∞–ª –∂–µ—Ä—Ç–≤–æ–π —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —ç–∫—Å–ø–µ—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ —Å —è–¥–∞–º–∏ // newsru.ua Thallium poisoning is difficult to recognize, because symptoms are very similar to diseases. Solovyov also probably chose thallium due to a lasting impression from reading Agatha Christie's \\"The Pale Horse\\", in which the killer uses thallium, stressing on the fact that the substance is hard to trace.  Murders  Solovyov chose his wife Olga as his first victim, with whom he had been since school and had lived together for 14 years. For a while, he threw small amounts of poison into her food, which caused her to die on December 9, 2003. The doctors could not establish that it was poisoning. The next victim was to be Solovyov's neighbor, whom he suspected of stealing a car battery, but as a result of a tragic combination of circumstances, Solovyov's 14-year-old daughter Nastya ate a poisoned red caviar from the can. Despite being seriously ill, she still decided to attend school. After six months of failed attempts to cure the girl, she died. Of course, Solovyov did not tell the doctors that he had poisoned her. The next victim was Solovyov's common-law wife Irina Astakhova, who died in hospital on May 3, 2005. The doctors found irreversible lesions on the liver and kidneys.–¢—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å ‚Äî –∏ –Ω–∏–∫–∞–∫–∏—Ö —Å–µ–º–µ–π! // –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∫–æ–º—Å–æ–º–æ–ª–µ—Ü Solovyov, in a peculiar way, \\"experimented\\" with poisons, pouring them in small doses to a number of colleagues at work, who suddenly began to have health problems - aches in joints, hair loss, vomiting and diarrhea. In the fall of 2006, Solovyov moved to live with Oksana Gurieva, who worked as an acrobatics trainer and had two little daughters. Soon he used the poison - while visiting Oksana's grandmother, he poured thallium into the decanter. The very healthy Oksana safely tolerated the poisoning, finding it to be a serious complication of the flu, but her grandmother Taisiya Iosifovna soon died. The next poisoning was particularly insolent - Solovyov poured poison into the investigator Shcherbakov's coffee directly at the interrogation in the case in which Solovyov took part. And again, doctors did not establish the poisoning. Solovyov then tried to poison his sister Oksana and her family - he poured poison into the jar, in which they distilled drinking water. Oksana and her husband survived in the hospital, but their 1-year-old child passed away. In this case, the appearance of the same symptoms in the whole family interested law enforcement. The examination found that there was poisoning with salts from heavy metals, and the investigation led to Solovyov, around whom people perished too often for suspicious reasons. In March 2007, he was arrested.  Trial and death  After the first meeting, the defendant attempted suicide by cutting open his veins. After a break, the hearing resumed, and the examination found that Solovyov is imputed. The court found him guilty of 6 murders committed with special cruelty, and many attempted ones. Before the announcement of the verdict Solovyov expressed remorse for his crimes, and said that he would not ask for forgiveness from the victims' families, as he knew he would get none. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.–Ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä-–æ—Ç—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å –ø–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª –Ω–µ –¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç—å –µ–º—É –ø–æ–∂–∏–∑–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è // –ö–æ–º—Å–æ–º–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞ On the night of December 2, Solovyov died in the cell of the pre-trial detention center, with the forensic medical examination finding that the cause of death was phlegmon - purulent inflammation of the subcutaneous tissues.

Starting as a modeller, he established a successful business in Burslem in the Staffordshire Potteries, from 1790-1818 trading as Wood and Caldwell. In the 18th century they produced many Staffordshire figures, which Wood modelled himself, and other types of earthenware and stoneware. After 1818 his company, now Enoch Wood & Sons, produced large quantities of blue and white transfer-printed tableware in earthenware, much of which was exported to America. Life He was born in 1759; his father Aaron Wood (1717‚Äì1785) was a highly regarded pottery modeller (mould maker), and his uncle Ralph Wood I (1715‚Äì1772), also a potter, became famous for producing well-modelled figures.Enoch Wood & Sons Patriotic America.

He began a business in Burslem in 1783 with his cousin Ralph Wood II, as an earthenware manufacturer; the two were the leading pottery modellers of the period. In 1790 he went into partnership with James Caldwell (1759-1838), a local lawyer, as Wood and Caldwell, and a new factory was built at Fountain Place in Burslem, which produced a wide range of earthenwares. The company also had mining interests: the Bycars Colliery in Burslem provided fuel for the factory. The partnership was successful, and continued until 1818, when Wood bought out Caldwell and Wood's three sons became partners, the firm becoming Enoch Wood & Sons. The new company produced a large quantity of blue transfer-printed earthenware, like other large potteries largely abandoning the figure market. A substantial amount of the wares were exported to America, where trade in earthenware increased after the end in 1815 of the Anglo-American war; Wood designed a range of items particularly for America. Enoch Wood died in 1840, and the business closed in 1845; finances were affected by a loss of trade with America, and by his children claiming their legacies.

It was announced in November 2017 by the apostolic nuncio to Estonia that Pope Francis would travel to the nation in the autumn sometime, with September being provided as a possible date. It was further related a week after that the pope would also be visiting neighboring Latvia and Lithuania; he would travel to all three to celebrate the centenary of their independence. The official confirmation for the visit would be made, according to media reports, in December 2017. The visit to the Baltic states was confirmed in a Holy See press release on 9 March 2018. Visit =Lithuania= In Lithuania, the pope visited Vilnius and Kaunas. Pope Francis arrived at the airport in Lithuania's capital of Vilnius on September 22, where he was welcomed by Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite and other political and civilian representatives. He later spoke outside the Presidential palace, where he noted how both Nazi and Soviet occupations weakened religious tolerance in the country and honored \\"martyrs\\" who died during these occupations. He also called for unity between Catholics, Lutherans, and followers of Eastern Orthodox in the country. He also visited the Divine Mercy Shrine, which serves as a major pilgrimage destination for Poles from neighboring Poland, and held a prayer service there. On September 23, he visited Lithuana's second largest city, Kaunus. Speaking in the city's Santakos Park to an estimated crowd of 100,000, the Pope honored the Jews who suffered oppression during the Nazi occupation between 1941 and 1944. Commemorating the Lithuanian Holocaust Memorial Day, the Pope condemned anti- Semitism which fueled Holocaust propaganda. He also paid tribute to Lithuanians who were deported to Siberian gulags or tortured and oppressed during five decades of Soviet occupation. He later returned to Vilnius to hold three-minutes of silent prayer at the Vilnius Ghetto's Holocaust memorial on the date which marked the 75th anniversary of the liquidation of Jews in the area and also laid flowers. He afterwards visited Vilnius' Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights, a Museum containing items and papers detailing the long history of Soviet oppression in Lithuania and which once served as headquarters for the local branch of the now defunct Soviet KGB, where he also spoke in the outside square to praise Lithuanians who stood up for their faith and described the country as a potential \\"beacon of hope.\\" =Latvia= Pope Francis in procession with the archbishops of the three major Christian churches in Latvia On September 24, Pope Francis arrived at the airport in Latvia's capital of Riga. Upon arrival, he met with Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis and the two travelled to the Presidential Palace. Commemorating Latvia's 100th anniversary of independence from Russian control, the Pope placed flowers at Latvia's Monument of Independence. At Riga's Lutheran Cathedral, he joined local Lutheran and Eastern Orthodox leaders at a music- filled ecumenical prayer and acknowledged the many trials Latvians endured during two Soviet occupations and the World War II-era occupation by Nazi Germany. Following this meeting, he held a prayer service in front of elderly Latvian Catholics who survived Nazi and Soviet occupations at Riga's Catholic Cathedral, where he praised them for maintaining their faith during brutal occupations and called on them to use it to set an example. He repeated this message during a homily at the Mother of God Basilica in Aglona, which is considered to be Latvia's most important Catholic shrine, and also criticized isolationism. =Estonia= On September 25, Pope Francis concluded his four- day trip to the Baltic nations by visiting Estonia. He arrived at the airport in the Estonian capital of Tallinn. Pope Francis met with President Kersti Kaljulaid, and the two gave a public address at the Rose Garden in the Tallinn district of Kadriorg, where the Pope acknowledged how sex abuse scandals are driving people away from the church.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012.  History  Camden is an historic centre dating from the earliest years of the nineteenth century, and has been associated with some of the earliest developments in the Australian wool, wheat and wine industries, particularly following the original land grant to pioneer John Macarthur in 1805. The first post office in Camden operated from about 1841, being preceded by a postal service of the 1830s, based at Cawdor where mails were exchanged with Sydney three times a week. Mrs Eliza Pearson reputedly operated the 1841 post office, and a record of 1846 showed that daily mail was received from Sydney. A telegraph office was opened in 1877 and in 1878 it was proposed to combine the two offices into a Government-built building. Tenders were called and a post office, on the present site, was completed in 1882. At that time it consisted of an office, four rooms, a servants room and a kitchen. Additional improvements, including a second storey to the residence and a balcony above the public area were approved in 1897. The date of construction of the current Camden Post Office has been identified as both 1882 and 1898, with elements of the 1882 building remaining in the present building. However, the 1898 works by builder Richard Basden were substantial, and largely engulfed the earlier building. A telephone exchange was also added in 1910.  Description  Camden Post Office is at 135 Argyle Street, Camden, comprising the whole of Lot 15 DP751265. The original Camden Post Office dates from 1882 in the era of Colonial Architect James Barnet, and this early core was buried beneath Edwardian additions (under the aegis of architect Walter Liberty Vernon), which have been dated at 1898 (the post hall, mail and service rooms, quarters), and 1910 (telephone exchange).Warmington and Ward However, the original building is still visible from some viewpoints, albeit concealed from Argyle Street by the later addition. The brickwork of the rear single-storey section is different in colour (darker) to the brickwork on the front two- storey section, and the roof of the rear section is corrugated galvanised steel sheeting. The original location of the telephone exchange inside the building is not known, but there was a telegram room in the building up until recent decades at the south-west end of the postal hall, and has been incorporated into the latter in recent years. There is no visible evidence that this room had direct access from the exterior of the building. For practical purposes, the earlier fabric can be regarded as a composite of the Barnet and Vernon work. The Barnet fabric can be seen in a stone pier by the front entry, and in areas with freestone window sill treatments. However, Barnet's freestone pier detail has been compromised by the fitting of a disabled ramp and its handrail in recent years. The post office occupies a prominent site in Argyle Street, the main shopping precinct. It has a broad alleyway to its immediate north-east, with its north-east entry apparently designed to develop a diagonal reading, common in Federation composition. The corner location also gives the entrance more prominence. At the same time the postal hall is composed as a broad frontal mass, symmetrical in the brick breakfront around three arched windows with orange brickwork around the arch openings, and asymmetrical in the total frontage with two flanking wings: one is a porch, the other has a plain-wall with a half-hipped roof similar to that of the porch, but not extending down as far. Both of these flanking wings have terracotta tile roofs. The latter wing has a former window to the front elevation which has been bricked up. The entry porch is anchored with a square sandstone pier, one of the Barnet vestiges, at its northeast corner, and has a slat work timber frieze over its front steps. A panel is fitted across the former opening to a post box porch that formerly was accessed from the entrance porch. A new post box porch has been built along the lane on the northeast side of the building. It has a steel frame and steel deck roofing. Period timber brackets and a frieze have been added to this in an attempt to render it more sympathetic to the style of the earlier buildings. A pair of automatic glazed sliding doors lead from the entrance porch to the postal hall. The building and its quarters are elevated on a plinth structure, which appears to be in cement rendered brick, later painted a dark colour. The plinths retain their original sub-floor vents. An illuminated standard sign has been placed outside the entry porch, bearing the Australia Post logo. The postal hall breakfront wing is in exposed face brick with three stilted arched windows. These are divided into two plain-paned hinged casements in the lower parts and fixed multi-pane lunettes in the upper. The postal hall wing has a flat roof concealed behind a parapet. The original door that accessed this balcony has been replaced by a new panel door. A rendered string-course bearing the building's name extends across the street-facing elevation. Above that is a parapet in the same face brick with a cement render capping rising and falling over three raised bays. The current Australia Post retail logo has been applied to the centre of these parapet bays. Timber-framed public phone booths were probably added to the left front in the early twentieth century, and were later replaced with standard PMG aluminium-clad type.Warmington and Ward's photos, Vol. 2, pp. 195-97 A telephone booth and post box are in now front of the breakfront. The quarters behind is an asymmetrical two-storeyed house with a projecting breakfront set on the southwest end, a terracotta tiled roof in the Marseilles pattern, horn finials, simple gabled roof endings, and a brick chimney with textured stucco and face brick capping. The windows are related to the postal hall in front, but are double-hung sashes rather than hinged casements. The gable ends have painted horizontally-laid boarding, coming down to just above the window-heads, with simple, deep-chord bargeboards. The roof has exposed rafters and angled eaves. It appears to have a small flat roof and timber bracketing directly onto the house wall. = Key areas/elements = * Federation characteristics * Earlier Victorian fabric * Streetscape presence = Condition = The post hall has been refurbished in the standard Australia Post retail format, with a suspended ceiling and recessed fluorescent lighting. The offices and service rooms have been refurbished at varying stages. Refurbishment of interiors has occurred at varying times through the twentieth century to around the mid-1990s. Much of the original fabric of the quarters is extant including panelled timber doors (some with original hardware), timber stairs, architraves, skirtings and fireplaces. Although some partitioning has been added in recent years, the original planning of the quarters is still determinable. The building is generally in good condition in both the interior and exterior. Overall the level of intactness is comparatively high relative to the 1898 works. = Original fabric = The original fabric of the building that still exists includes: * Structural frame: Load-bearing (solid) brick with timber floor and roof framing. * External walls: face load-bearing brick, with some cement render dressings on walls, chimneys and other elements. * Internal walls: load-bearing brick with hard plaster finish, others are timber framed partitions clad in plasterboard/lathe and plaster and painted. * Floor: mixed; concrete (lower, post office) timber frame in upper and part of the lower level. Clad in carpet (retail and rear office areas), vinyl tile (lunchroom, storage areas) ceramic tiles (amenities and wet areas). * Ceiling: some plasterboard on lower level; some suspended with aluminium grid frame supporting acoustic tiles. On upper level lath and plaster. * Roof: Marseilles- patterned terracotta tile (quarters); tile and some metal decking (post office, quarters porch). Corrugated galvanised steel sheet roofing on rear single-storey section. = Timeline of development = 1882: initial construction.1898: a Federation Free style envelope and breakfront postal hall added around the original building under Walter Vernon's aegis as New South Wales Government Architect. George Oakeshott may have been the designer. 1910: addition of the telephone exchange.  Heritage listing  The significant components of Camden Post Office include the evolved main postal building and the two-storey former residence sited behind, which retains original fabric extending to the rear. Elements which are not of heritage significance include the new post box porch, with awning over, and ramp, along the lane on the north-east side of the building. Camden Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Camden Post Office, the original component of which dates to 1882, with later works the most substantial of which date from 1898, is located in an historic centre which dates from the earliest years of settlement in New South Wales. Camden is of considerable importance in terms of early Australian developments in wool in particular, following the original land grant to pioneer John Macarthur in 1805, with the first post office operating locally from about 1841. The current post office, while associated with the comparatively later history of the town, is still of nineteenth century origin, with its establishment and subsequent development reflecting the needs of postal services in the town. Although an evolved building physically and architecturally, it remains evidently a historic postal building. Its prominent location in the main town strip of Argyle Street, also enhances this aspect of significance. Criterion D: Characteristic values Camden Post Office is an example of: * a post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) * an example of Late Victorian (1880s) and Federation Free Style (1898, 1910) architecture * the work of the New South Wales Government Architect's Office under direction of James Barnet (1882), Walter Vernon (1898, 1910), and George Oakeshott Typologically, Camden Post Office is a composite building comprising an initial construction stage of 1882; a Federation Free Style envelope and breakfront postal hall added around the original building under Walter Vernon's aegis as New South Wales Government Architect in 1898; and a 1910 telephone exchange likely to be by George Oakeshott. The 1898 residence largely remains, with much of the original fabric extant and the planning still discernible. The original location of the 1910 telephone exchange inside the building is not known, however. A new post box porch has also been built along the lane on the northeast side of the building. More broadly, as a composite building, the typological intactness has been compromised, despite the relative overall intactness of the 1898 works. Architecturally and stylistically, the 1898 exterior of the post office can be considered in the Federation context of the post office form, and is a Free style post office in the tradition of a number of other buildings by Walter Vernon and his office. Camden does come comparatively early in this group, which mark Vernon's middle period as Government Architect. As such the post office could be considered a prototype for a large series of Vernon-era buildings, designed by George Oakeshott and others in Vernon's office. The parapeted breakfront post office design, with a porch to one side, also predated the appearance of similar post offices around the country. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Camden Post Office, although a composite building comprising a central Victorian building with substantial Federation additions, has a strong streetscape presence, with a handsome fa√ßade and detailing to Argyle Street. More broadly, the building also contributes to the historic character of central Camden. The post office additionally features in tourism promotional material which celebrates Camden's diversity of architectural styles. Criterion H: Significant people Camden Post Office is significant for its association with architect Walter Vernon and his office, particularly for being a comparatively early design of Vernon's in the Federation Free style post office mode. As such the post office could be considered a prototype for a large series of Vernon-era buildings, designed by George Oakeshott and others in Vernon's office.

Biography  = Provenance and early years = Margarete \\"Gretl\\" Jost was born at the height of the First World War into a working-class family. She grew up in the Erdberg quarter of the Rabenhof district in the south-eastern part of the central Vienna. The family was resolute in its support of the (not yet quite mainstream) Social Democratic Workers' Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei\\"). In that respect Grete and her two sisters enjoyed what some would have regarded as an \\"Austro-Marxist upbringing\\". She attended state junior and middle schools locally. Aged only seven she was enrolled into the \\"Workers' Gymnastics Association\\" (\\"Arbeiterturnverein\\"). She was also a member of the (socialist) \\"Kindefreunde\\" organisation between 1926 and 1930. In 1931 she got a job selling shoes. She lost it fairly soon, after which she had no regular employment till 1937, when she managed to get another job as a sales assistant, this time in a knitwear shop. While working as a shoe saleswoman she joined the Free Trades Unions organisation. = Politics and resistance = Jost withdrew from her trades union activism and, following the brief but brutally suppressed insurrection of February 1934, joined the Communist Party. Joining the Communists reflected a widespread belief on the political left in Vienna that the Social Democratic Workers' Party had shown itself to be insufficiently robust in resisting the political developments of the time. Austria was in the process of becoming a one-party state and Communist Party membership had been illegal since May 1933. She nevertheless participated in party training and recruitment activities. She worked as a treasurer for local party cells and, till Autumn/Fall 1937, undertook distribution of party literature. She intensified her illegal political activism after March 1938 which was when Fascist Austria was formally incorporated into an enlarged Nazi Germany following a largely unresisted military invasion from the north-west. Margarete Jost became a member of the regional \\"Provinzkommission\\". From 1938 she was working as a contact between locals party activists and senior party officials. She became the party contact for the \\"S√ºdbahnstrecke\\" - the part of Vienna surrounding the S√ºdbahnhof railway terminus. On the one side this involved communicating instructions from the party regional leadership to activists living \\"underground\\" (their place of residence not registered with the city authorities): on the other hand she was responsible for passing to the leadership reports of the \\"illegal work\\" undertaken by activists in this part of Vienna. In July 1940 the authorities arrested forty members of the organisation, but even after this sources indicate that there were still around fifty communist activists in the district defined, for the purposes of party organisation, by the suburb of Baden and the surrounding district (\\"Bezirk Baden und Umgebung\\"). Jost administered cash contributions and the application of the funds to support comrades who had been arrested and the families left destitute by those arrests. Grete Jost travelled several times in the company of other party members to the underground party headquarters at Baden, some 30 km / 18 miles south of Vienna to discuss political developments and the party's \\"illegal work\\". She also continued regularly to distribute antifascist publications such as the party's daily newspaper, \\"Rote Fahne\\", \\"Weg und Ziel\\" and other publications. One publication that she distributed was entitled \\"Letter of a Young Worker to a Nazi Work-colleague\\" (\\"Brief eines jungen Arbeiters an einen nationalsozialistischen Arbeitskammeraden\\"). This was viewed with particular disfavour by the Nazi authorities because they called on workers to fight against Hitler-fascism and included presise instructions on how to degrade and/or undermine fascist institutions and the German army. = Arrest, trial, conviction and execution = Grete Jost was arrested on 8, 9 or 11 February 1941. Sources differ, but only in respect of the date. She was taken to the \\"investigation prison\\" alongside the Schiffamtsgasse in the Leopoldstadt quarter of central Vienna. Those of her fellow detainees who survived included Antonia Bruha. They would later describe Jost as a courageous and energetic woman, always thirsty for knowledge. She took food to fellow inmates and engaged in lengthy conversations with those that needed to talk. She never gave up on the fight against the Nazi r√©gime. When she was able to obtain information from outside, she always took care to pass it on in full. Jost's trial took place on 23 September 1942. She was convicted on the usual charge, under these circumstances, of \\"preparing to commit high treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\") and condemned to death. Others sentenced to deathat the same time included Theodor Pawlin, Theodor Gindra, Gustav Srch and Rudi Spulka. She was transferred to the death cells which were located in the basement under the women's section on the prison hospital. The Communist resistance activist Anna Haider was employed as an assistant in the hospital and was therefore able sometimes to access the death cells to take newspapers to the condemned and, sometimes, engage in conversation with them. She later reported that even at this stage Grete Jost's conduct was exemplary, always ready to comfort others scheduled for execution, and never losing hope of liberation from her fate through the timely arrival of the Red army. It is apparent, too, from the letters she sent her fianc√© and parents during the Autumn/Fall of 1942 that even after sentencing Grete Jost did not immediately lose all hope, though she does appear to have been subject to savage mood swings. Relatives tried desperately to obtain a pardon for her. Her mother had even travelled to Berlin to lobby the justice department. These efforts proved fruitless, however. A guillotine had been installed inside the Vienna District Court complex (\\"Wiener Landesgericht\\") in 1938, shortly after the annexation. Margarete Jost was executed on it on 15 January 1943. Her final words, reportedly, were \\"Es lebe die Freiheit!\\" (loosely, \\"Long live freedom\\").

The results were presented in March 1995. Regarding the Amateur Radio Service the DSI Management Team recommended (among other things) that frequencies in the vicinity of 40.68 MHz be considered for amateur propagation beacons. A secondary allocation to the amateur service is also appropriate.Results of DSI Phase II, 1995 p.114 At the same time NTIA publishes U.S. National Spectrum Requirements: Projections and Trends. Future spectrum requirements for the amateur and the amateur-satellite services were contained in responses to the Notice provided by ARRL and AMSAT including narrow spectrum allocations (e.g.. five, 50 KHz slots) in the range of 30 and 50 MHz. As noted, the request for additional narrow spectrum allocations for propagation experimentation needs to be studied for technical compatibility.US National Spectrum Requirements: Projections and Trends, 1995 p. 163-169 The International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) in Region-1 is currently encouraging member societies to try and obtain propagation beacon permissions at 40 MHz and 60 MHz.

It is also known as the 'Anti- Prostitution Law'. The law came into force on April 1, 1957, and all provisions were fully effective on April 1 of the following year. As the law does not punish prostitution per se, (client and prostitute), it is viewed as a preventive law rather than a prohibition law. History Japan has a history of supervised prostitution dating back to the Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333). In 1618, during the Edo period, Y≈´kaku areas were set up and prostitution regulated. From the late 1880s onwards, various groups, including the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Purity Society lobbied for the end of legalised prostitution. The Japanese government resisted these demands on the grounds that they provided effective control of STIs and that without them men's sexual desires would lead to increased cases of rape and sex crimes. Under pressure from the abolitionists, in May 1934 the Home Ministry announced that licensed prostitution would be abolished in the near future, but no action was taken. During the American occupation of japan following WW2, prostitution boomed. In January 1946 the General Headquarters of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (GHQ/SCAP), issued an order to abolish licensed prostitution. This led to the Businesses Affecting Public Morals Regulation Act being passed in 1948. A bill prohibiting prostitution was put before the Diet (Congress) in 1947 but was defeated. Female Diet members attempted to introduce various anti-prostitution measures until in May 1956 they succeeded with the Prostitution Prevention Law. Main articles The main articles of the legislation are as follows: * Chapter I General Provisions  Article 1: States that: 'Prostitution harms the dignity of the individual, is against sexual virtue and disrupts the proper morals of society'. It defines the purpose of the Act as punishing those who promote prostitution and preventing prostitution by taking measures for guidance, protection and rehabilitation to women who are likely to prostitute themselves.  Article 2: Defines prostitution as 'having sexual intercourse with a non-specified person(s) in exchange for compensation or the promise of such'. No punishment is proscribed.  Article 3: Prohibits being a counterpart to prostitution (i.e. a prostitute or client) but no punishment is proscribed. * Chapter 2 Criminal Procedure - The following acts are prohibited:  Article 5: Inducing others to purchase sexual services in public (pimping and solicitation).  Article 6: Proclamation of prostitution (pimping).  Article 7: Coercing others into prostitution.  Article 8: Receiving compensation for the coercion of others into prostitution.  Article 9: Providing benefits to enable others to provide prostitution services.  Article 10: Making a contract for the purpose of providing a prostitution service to others.  Article 11: Provision of places in which prostitution may take place (brothels).  Article 12: Managing or organizing a place of prostitution.  Article 13: Providing funds required for places of prostitution or other prostitution businesses. * Chapter 3 Dispensation  Article 17: A women who commits a crime under Article 5 may be subjected to a guidance action. * Chapter 4 Protective Rehabilitation  Article 34: All prefectures and counties should set up women's guidance homes.  Article 36: Women's protection facilities may be set up for the purpose of protection and rehabilitation.

Between 1992 and 1997, he raped 37 (according to other sources - 39) underage girls and killed 4 people (among them 2 rape victims) in the city of Tolyatti, in the Samara Oblast.  Crimes  Between 1992 and 1995, Rylkov committed a series of rapes on girls aged between 6 and 13. Taking advantage of the lack of adults, he broke into the victims' apartments (the victims told that Rylkov was knocking on the door, asked to drink water or call an ambulance), raped them, and then robbed the apartment. On February 7, 1996, Rylkov committed the first murder, killing 7-year-old Ruslan Tkachev. He easily convinced the boy to come with him, and then brutally killed him in the Portship village of Tolyatti, inflicting a total of several dozen stab wounds. Then Rylkov cut off the boy's genitals, ears, tongue, and eyes. Subsequently, when the corpse was discovered, the experts could not determine immediately the sex of the victim due to the heavy mutilation. Soon Rylkov was detained by the police for lacking documents and public intoxication, but released after three days. Subsequently, he committed several dozen rapes, 2 of which ended in brutal murders. In one of these attacks, he broke into an apartment where an underage boy and his sister were in. The brother miraculously managed to escape, but his sister was killed with an axe. Soon Rylkov was identified by witnesses, and was put on a wanted list by the judicial police. On July 20, 1996, Rylkov killed another girl. The mutilated body was found in an abandoned bunker on the territory of a military unit. This time there were witnesses however, who claimed to have seen Rylkov with the girl on Topolina Street in Tolyatti, and a facial composite was soon created. By the evening, the man was identified as Oleg Rylkov. A few days later a police patrol, under the guise of selling counterfeit money, arrested Rylkov, who pretended to be a friend named Yashchenko. Rylkov then took a pledge not to leave the area and was let go. When several days later the real Yashchenko was summoned to the prosecutor's office, he appeared, and thanks to him the forgery was revealed. According to Yashchenko, his friend was planning to go to Novokuznetsk. At that time, another maniac was operating in Novokuznetsk, whose modus operandi was similar to Rylkov's. Rylkov was also suspected in the murders of more than 20 children around the city. Through the television and newspapers, his name and data were given out. The investigation team working on the case of the \\"Novokuznetsk Monster\\" were initially unsuccessful in capturing Rylkov. Rylkov was soon arrested in Tolyatti. Another victim of his was a 40-year-old woman who was sheltered at his dacha, whom he killed with an axe. As it later turned out, he never left Tolyatti, and was not involved in the Novokuznetsk murders, for which Alexander Spesivtsev was soon detained. Rylkov confessed to all of his crimes, except the very first murder. When asked about what he felt during the murders, he replied: \\"It sounds blasphemous, but something...a higher pleasure, or something\\". In 1998, Rylkov was sentenced to death for his crimes, but due to the moratorium on the death sentence it was replaced with life imprisonment. The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict without change. After spending a little more than a year in prison, Rylkov confessed to his first murder. In June 2000 he was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but since he was already given life imprisonment, the sentence remained the same. Currently, he is serving his sentence at the Black Dolphin Prison. In early 2012, Rylkov admitted that on the evening of May 27, 1994 in the attic of a house on the Ordzhonikidze Boulevard, he raped a 12-year-old child. In the autumn of the same year, Tolyatti police reported the disclosure of the rape of a minor committed more than 18 years ago in the elevator of a house on Sverdlov Street, to which Rylkov also confessed to. In 2013, Rylkov confessed to murdering a 45-year-old woman in 1993, whose corpse was found with multiple knife injuries to the chest in the forest near the \\"Prilesye\\" sanatorium. However, the Investigative Committee of Russia could not confirm this, and the materials were sent back to the police.  In the media  * In the rush hour.

Buranlure is located in the commune of Boulleret, in the Cher department, in the Centre-Val de Loire region.  History  The domain of Buranlure, owned by the de Bar family, vassals to the Count of Sancerre, played a key defensive role in the vicinity between the 14th and 16th centuries. Built adjacent to the Loire river, it was at the border between two kingdoms: that of the king of France, residing a few kilometres away in Bourges, and the Burgundians, in Cosne sur Loire. It was frequently used as a command post for the king's troops during the Hundred Years' War to counter the Anglo-Burgundians. During the religious wars, the then lord of Buranlure, Antoine de Bar, raised an army to support the Mar√©chal de La Ch√¢tre as he was laying siege to Sancerre, a Protestant stronghold. As the de Bar family gradually abandoned it for more comfortable houses, it was acquired in 1769 by the Perrinet Langeron family. Their interest in the purchase was more the pastures included in the estate than the castle, as they deemed it dull and sober. They converted the castle into a farmer's lodgings, and so it remained until the beginning of the 20th century. This lack of interest left Buranlure architecturally untouched, allowing it to keep its rustic look and feel throughout the centuries while other castles were given more modern touches. However, heavily worn out by time and the occupation, an ambitious restoration project was launched at the end of World War II by Arnaud de Vog√º√©, a descendant of the Perrinet Langeron family. Great care was given to make sure Buranlure kept its authenticity thanks to the work of experts and local craftsmen. It was classified a monument historique in 1944 and has remained in the same family ever since.  Events  The castle is open to the public every year during the European heritage days. In 2017 Buranlure hosted the Format Raisin festival and was a part of the \\"Summer in Boulleret\\" program. It has been used as a setting for several films or TV films: * Le Grand Inquisiteur by Raoul Sangla for Antenne 2 (1979) * Parking by Jacques Demy, with Francis Huster (1985) * Dandin by Roger Planchon, with Claude Brasseur and Zabou Breitman (1987) * Les Trois Mousquetaires (TV film) (2005) * Henri IV (2008) by Jo Baier * La Commanderie (2008) s√©rie TV.

Before the Meiji Restoration, his courtesy title was Noto-no-kami, and his Court rank was Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade. Biography Do Toshitada was the only son of the 5th daimy≈ç of ≈åno, Doi Toshinori, and was born in Edo after his father had retired and had turned the domain over to Doi Toshikata. Soon after his gempuku ceremony in 1818, Toshikata died without heir and Toshitada inherited the position of daimy≈ç. Due to his youth, he remained in Edo until 1829 and the domain was administered by its senior retainers. Toshitada first visited ≈åno in 1829, and (as with most of the feudal domains in Japan at the time), found that the domain finances were in serious difficulties. He immediately began a reform program to boost production of local products, establish monopolies on trade, and to take over control of a local copper mine. However, as these efforts took time to have any effect, in 1842 he issued a severely worded proclamation stressing fiscal frugality and condemning corruption and replacing complacent or inefficient officials. In 1844, he established a han school modelled after the Tekijuku in Osaka, wth a strong emphasis on rangaku teachings of western medicine and industrial science. The school became famous, and also attracted students from outside the domain. From 1845, he began to reform the domain's military according to the teachings of Takashima Sh≈´han, purchasing western firearms and cannon. He redoubled these efforts after the Perry Expedition of 1853, ordering that his samurai abandon their obsolete spears and arrows for rifles. Toshitada also established a nationwide network of shops called ≈åno-ya (Â§ßÈáéÂ±ã). These shops sold local products from ≈åno and purchases products in demand by the domain as part of the domain's trade monopoly and also lent money; however, they were also a front for an intelligence-gathering operation run by the domain. In 1855, branches of the ≈åno-ya were located in Osaka, Hakodate, Gifu, Nagoya and many other locations. After 1855, the Tokugawa shogunate became increasing concerned about the expansionist policies of the Russian Empire and its encroachment on Japan's northern frontiers. Many domains were ordered to station forces in Ezo (Hokkaido) to deter Russian aggression. ≈åno Domain already had a presence in Oshima Peninsula; however, Toshitada petitioned to be allowed to develop the remote island of \\"Kita-Ezo\\" (Karafuto) to the north of Hokkaido. Permission was granted in 1858, and despite its landlocked location, the domain built a two-masted sailing ship, the ≈åno Maru, which was based out of Tsuruga port. However, the venture proved very difficult due to the island's remoteness and inclement climate, and the unsettled conditions of the Bakumatsu period. The project was abandoned in 1864 after the accidental sinking of the ≈åno Maru. Toshitada retired in 1862, citing illness, and died in 1869.

Biography  In 1992, Petrov was conditionally sentenced for stealing a computer. While serving in the army, he almost killed his commander, but the case was concealed by the military prosecutor's office itself. He graduated from a vocational school with the specialty of a fitter, and worked as a combine operator with his father. He had a common-law marriage and a small son. Petrov did not smoke and drink, and generally led a normal lifestyle. He also loved motor sports. In 1998, a schoolgirl named Maria Polivtseva went missing. She was on a visit to relatives alone, but never arrived at their home. In 1999, another schoolgirl who was visiting her grandmother disappeared briefly after leaving the house. In the same year, another girl went missing while she walking around with her parents at the city pond. And again in the same year, two more girls went missing as well. In 2000, right in the middle of the day, a 14-year-old girl was kidnapped in front of her younger sister. The man wanted to take both girls away, but the younger girl managed to escape. The investigation suggested that the girls were taken into sexual slavery, which meant that there was a chance of finding them alive. Soon, a local artist reported a suspicious man who was a carrying a child with him, and drew his portrait. The investigation was skidding, and the situation in the city was getting heated. Authorities did not want to recognize the existence of a serial killer, and therefore security measures were not taken in the city. But soon after, five half-burned and dismembered bodies of missing girls were found in a nearby forest (the sixth body was found later), all of them raped before being killed. Suddenly, the murders stopped. It was suggested that the criminal was imprisoned, and all prisoners in the area were examined. But in 2003, at the gates of a children's camp, a female volleyball player was kidnapped. Local fishermen soon found her mutilated corpse in the river. The investigators soon learned that just before the murder, a young man was seen driving a car and suggested to local schoolgirls to take a ride with him. To one of them, he revealed that his name was \\"Petrov\\". Soon after, Yevgeny Petrov was arrested, and under the weight of the evidence, he confessed to 11 murders. Petrov said that he caught girls on the roads, forced them into his car and then drove them to a secluded spot where he would rape, kill, dismember and burn them afterwards. In an interview with journalists he admitted his guilt, but expressed no remorse. Two additional cases were also revealed, in which Petrov's victims actually managed to survive. In 2005, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment. While in prison, Petrov tried several times to commit suicide in his cell. The parents of his victims demanded the death penalty, and the father of one of them offered that Petrov be extradited to them. = In the media = * The documentary film \\"Sinister Triangle\\", hosted by Eduard Petrov from the series \\"Honest Detective\\", is based on Yevgeny Petrov's case.

Butia stolonifera was collected in 1869 by professor Jos√© Arechavaleta, purportedly from the Pan de Az√∫car hill. Two plants were grown from his collection, one at Montevideo and one at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden. By the turn of the century the palm in Rio de Janeiro had become a large mature specimen, and Jo√£o Barbosa Rodrigues named it as a new species in 1901, calling it Cocos stolonifera. He formally described it in 1903, providing an illustration (shown right). According to the descriptions by Barbosa Rodrigues, this plant was acaulescent and caespitose, having a number of underground trunks splitting from the crown of roots. If truly a Butia, the plant was unique in that the trunks grew from rhizomes or stolons snaking underground up to a length of two metres; thus the plant colonised a large patch of ground. Barbosa Rodrigues did not describe nor illustrate the flowers of the plant. In 1916 the great Italian palm expert Odoardo Beccari raised the subgenus Butia to genus, housing a number of former Cocos species, which he distinguished primarily using details of the inflorescence, as well as a number of details of the leaves and the number of locules in the fruit (2‚Äì3). On the basis of Barbosa Rodrigues' illustration and descriptions in literature of details of the leaves, such as the spines on the petiole and a bifurcated point at the end of the pinnae (leaflets), Beccari moved Cocos stolonifera to Butia without even having seen the plant or studied Barbosa Rodrigues' herbarium specimen, although he expressed his doubts regarding the placement, having been unable to study the flowers. Both living trees in Montevideo and Rio de Janeiro have long since died and Barbosa Rodrigues' specimens were unfortunately destroyed with much of the rest of his collection. The discovery locality for this palm; Cerro Pan de Az√∫car. In 1939, in his Flora von Uruguay, Wilhelm Gustav Franz Herter included the taxon and provided an illustration of the leaf and inflorescence, attributing the authorship to himself as B. stolonifera (Barb.Rodr.)

[1995], Govaerts [1996], and Govaerts & Dransfield [2005]) continued to accept his taxonomy and the validity of the species, but S. F. Glassman in 1970 considered the taxon a nomen dubium, and Kelen Pureza Soares et al. in 2014 published their doubts about the validity of the taxon, both research papers arguing its taxonomic placement as a Butia is in doubt. Having spines along the margin of the petiole is no longer considered a defining characteristic of the genus Butia. The original description and illustration of this palm most resembled Syagrus campylospatha, but differs primarily in the spines on the margin of the petiole, and the pinnae (leaflets) ending in a bifurcated point, unlike the almost spine-like apex of the pinnae of S. campylospatha. Errata A number of sources have this species of palm as occurring in southern Brazil; this would appear to be an error if Glassman and Soares are correct in stating that the plant was only collected once in Uruguay.

There is a simpler variant for children and adults that may be played by 3-8 players.  Rules  The following rules are based on Sirch (2008).  Cards  A Bavarian pattern pack of 32 cards is used. Typically the Sixes are removed from a Schafkopf pack. Alternatively any German-suited pack may be used. The cards rank in their natural order: Sow (Sau), King, Ober, Unter, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven.  Dealing  Dealer shuffles the cards and offers to rearhand to cut. Each player is then dealt 8 cards, either in two packets of 4 or four packets of 2 cards. Dealing and play are clockwise.  Bidding  Players may bid for the following contracts: * Beddl - to take no tricks * Mord - to take all tricks If no-one bids for a contract, a normal game is played as described below. If two players bid, positional priority applies. The successful bidder becomes the declarer and plays against the 3 'defenders'.  Playing  Forehand leads to the first trick. There are no trumps. Hearts may not be led to either of the first two tricks. Players must follow suit (Farbzwang), but there is no compulsion to win the trick (i.e. no Stechzwang). = Beddl = Beddl is Bavarian for Bettel, i.e. a contract in which the declarer undertakes to win no tricks. If they do have to take a trick, the hand ends immediately and the declarer loses. Hearts become irrelevant. = Mord = Mord literally means \\"murder\\", but is the equivalent of a slam or march (Durchmarsch), a contract in which the declarer undertakes to win every trick. As soon as an opponent wins a trick, the hand ends and the declarer loses. Again, who wins which Hearts is irrelevant. = Schleichermord = A Schleichermord or \\"sneaky Mord\\" is when a player decides to play a Mord without announcing it and aims to win all the tricks.  Scoring  In a normal game, players pay 10c for every Heart captured to the player who has avoided taking any. If 2 players are void in Hearts, they each receive 40c. If a player captures all 8 Hearts, they pay 80c to the stock (pot). If a Beddl or Mord is won, the losers pay the declarer 80c each. If the declarer loses, he pays 80c to each opponent. A Schleichermord is worth 80c if won; if it is lost no-one will know anyway!  Variant  A simple variant, suitable for children as well as adults, is to play the normal game. Any number of players from 3 to 8 may play; a Bavarian- pattern Schafkopf pack is used, 36 cards are dealt accordingly and any leftover cards put to one side, face down. Players only play a 'normal game' and score penalty points for each Heart taken. Players may agree to play a set number of rounds and the winner is then the one with the fewest points. Alternatively they may choose to play until the first person reaches an agreed total e.g. 50 points.  References   Literature  * Sirch, Walter (2008).

Biography  After graduation, Malyuk entered a forestry college, but did not intend to associate his life with this sphere. He considered himself a talented person, engaged in music and was a director of the amateur theatre ensemble in the Ukhta Palace of Culture. Considering that in this province his talent could not be realised, Maluyk left for Moscow in 1999. He dreamed of settling in some popular band, touring and earning money. However, everywhere Malyuk went he received a refusal, and eventually ran out of money. His ambitions interfered with returning to Ukhta, however. The main way for Malyuk to earn money was to purchase and sell household appliances and electronics, which he bought at a low price and, if necessary, repaired and then sold again. Even when he committed his crimes, his main income was precisely speculation and not prey from the murders, which suggested that it was self- interest that motivated him, but a desire to kill. Over time, Maluyk became closed up, nervous and irritable. When he realised that he could not count on taking part in musical groups, it drove him into a deep depression. Once during a deal, he was robbed, and on the day after that, he went to the market where he bought a Beretta with a few packs of cartridges and a Makarov pistol from an unknown seller. At home with the help of some tools, he altered the Beretta. Subsequently, one of the investigators into the Malyuk case said: In November 2000, Malyuk committed his first crime. His victim was photographer Maxim Fedan, whom Malyuk lured out under the pretext of buying a camera from him. Originally Malyuk did not plan on killing him, but when the photographer actively resisted, he shot him three times. Fedan had enough strength to jump out of the car and run a few meters, but then fell over and died. Malyuk then took the camera from the dead man and left the crime scene. Two people from neighboring houses witnessed the event from their windows. One of them, a certain Tarverdiev, ran out in the street and, not disdaining the looting, took a mobile phone from the dead Fedan. At this time he was noticed by a militsiya patrol, who detained him and subsequently convicted him of theft and failure to provide assistance. The next day, after reviewing a criminal chronicle, Malyuk was satisfied that he was finally in the spotlight. One day, in May 2001, while examining newspaper ads, the killer drew attention to the article \\"Sentenced to an armchair\\", which described the problems of an elderly woman, Lebedeva, who had been given adequate attention by her guardian. On 29 May 2001, Malyuk devised a plan - he ordered an expensive laptop from a computer firm and killed the businessman who came to Lebedeva's address, then entered and shot her as well. Another victim of Malyuk was an on-looker. According to the investigators, when Malyuk killed this man, he also decimated his chances of escaping. On 7 September 2001, Malyuk killed witness Viktor Gusev with a total of 7 shots, and then stole 950 dollars from him. =Arrest= On 12 March 2002, Viktor Malyuk was detained on suspicion of committing four murders. Throughout the investigation and at the trial the murderer did not admit guilt in any way, and wrote many complaints to all instances. The forensic psychiatric examinations recognized Malyuk as sane and responsible for his actions. On 26 December 2003, the Moscow City Court sentenced him to life imprisonment. Since the introductions of jury trials in Moscow, it was the first time that all jurors agreed the version of the charges. In the spring of 2004, the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict without change. However, a day prior to his shipment to a prison colony, Viktor Malyuk killed himself, hanging himself with his bed sheets.

Wackenthaler's reputation is due to his genius for improvisation and his ability to adapt his organ to liturgical requirements. He published many small organ compositions for teaching purposes, as well as organ pieces by German composers.  Life  Born in S√©lestat (Bas-Rhin), Wackenthaler's father, Fran√ßois-Joseph Wackenthaler (1767‚Äì1828), organist of the main church of Selestat, is the founder of a family of musicians. Two of his brothers, Fran√ßois-Charles and Fran√ßois-Louis, and his nephew Nicolas-Joseph Wackenthaler were organists at the St. George's Church of S√©lestat. His second son, Fran√ßois Xavier Joseph, (1823‚Äì1856), was organist at Haguenau and later in Paris, where he was the first organ teacher at the √âcole Niedermeyer of Paris.. His father taught him music, without neglecting literary studies. Joseph Wackenthaler shared the first prizes of the college in his hometown with the most distinguished students. At the time he finished his studies, he first had the project of entering the orders; but his vocation, more pronounced for the culture of religious music, made him give up. His talent as a pianist and the success of his first compositions led him to Strasbourg, to succeed Spindler, who was one of his musical composition masters. Wackenthaler wrote several masses with a large orchestra that were performed in this cathedral. In 1833, the organist's position in this church was combined with that of Kapellmeister and entrusted to Wackenthaler, who composed a large number of organ pieces of a severe style that had spread throughout Alsace. He is also responsible for a treaty of plainsong and a treaty to accompany these songs, which have been approved by the competent authorities. He also carefully reviewed and corrected the new editions of the vesperal and gradual of his diocese.. He taught music. His students included Joseph Schiffmacher,Joseph Schiffmacher √âdouard Ignace Andlauer and Eug√®ne Wintzweiller that he sent to the √âcole Niedermeyer of Paris. He married Marie- Th√©r√®se Schmidt Annuaire de la Soci√©t√© des amis du Vieux Strasbourg, 1977 and had three children, Th√©r√®se-Jos√©phine, Fran√ßois-Xavier Joseph and Marie C√©cile, all three musicians. Wackenthaler died in Strasbourg.  Works  The following three compositions date back to 1849, when Joseph Wackenthaler was organist at the Strasbourg Cathedral *Fantaisie et fugue en Fa mineur *Pr√©lude et fugue an Ut mineur *Pr√©lude et fugue en Ut majeur These works have been composed for inaugural concerts of new organs or for competitions.

The SCR was based on the Porsche 911 SC and the changes made to its engine enabled it to have identical performance to the 930 Turbo, despite having a naturally aspirated engine.  History  Due to the Gulf Oil Crisis of the 1970s and more strict emission laws, Porsche like many other car manufacturers at that time, reduced the power output of its naturally aspirated flat-6 engine to thus creating a huge power and performance gap in its naturally aspirated 911 lineage and the Turbo. Those wanting a model lying in-between that gap had to opt for the expensive and luxurious 928 grand tourer. Seeing the potential of the naturally aspirated engine to generate a higher power output while maintaining fuel economy, Ruf introduced the SCR in 1978 based on the 911 SC. This marked the first Ruf modification done to a Porsche 911. Key changes over the 911 SC included an engine with an enlarged capacity of 3,185 cc generating a maximum power output of at 6,000 rpm combined with a special Ruf built gearbox along with a Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system and front mounted oil coolers hence achieving the desired fuel efficiency whilst maintaining a higher power output than the donor car (17.3L/100km). Other aesthetic changes included the \\"whale tail\\" spoiler found on the 930 Turbo, a deep chin spoiler at the front, a new front bumper with integrated round brake cooling ducts, optional wide wheel arches as found on the 930 Turbo and special Ruf 5-spoke alloy wheels. The car had a Spartan driver-focused interior with racing bucket seats and six-point racing harness. All of these changes enabled the SCR to achieve identical performance levels as the Turbo. The SCR, with its performance filled the void left between the naturally aspirated 911 models and the Turbo while still costing less than the latter at 65,000 DM (the 930 Turbo had a price tag of 79,000 DM while the 911 SC and the 928 had price tags of 41,860 and 60,707 DM respectively). Its publicity in German automobile magazines at the time of its introduction made it a commercial success.

Biography  On July 19, 2005, 12-year-old Mikhail Elshin, along with his 10-year-old brother Alexander and 11-year-old friend Pavel Sokolov left the hostel at a weaving factory in Dedovsk to take a walk, but did not return home in the evening. The maniac had met the three boys in the area of Christmas Road, when they were returning from the walk. He offered them a ride to the railway station, but eventually turned the car towards a field. On July 29 in the Istrinsky District, not far from the Luzhki village, the mutilated body of Mikhail Elshin was found. On August 1, one and a half kilometres away from the discovery site of Mikhail's body, the bodies of Alexander Elshin and Pavel Sokolov were found.

Biography  Krotov was born in the Omsk Oblast. His father was a doctor, who now lives in Ukraine, together with Vadim's mother and sister. He served in Primorye, where he lived, and soon got married. Krotov worked as a docker, and was characterized positively everywhere he went.

As a rule, he only looked for girls who ran away from their parents or were orphaned. After drinking, he then forced the girls to have sex with him. The first murder Krotov committed was on the night of August 14 to 15, 1997. A 15-year-old girl, who was in Krotov's house, began to scream loudly and prevented him from sleeping. The drunken girl either called for help, or screamed from fear. The drunken Krotov then walked into the kitchen and strangled her. Then he strangled the second girl who was at his house and slept in the next room, fearing that she would become an unnecessary witness. He then dismembered their bodies in the bath tub, and put the girls' heads in a bag, and their legs and hands in another, scattering them in the nearby forest. After this, he proceeded to kill 2 more girls over two years. When rumors of the brutal murders of girls crawled through the city, many people who visited Krotov's house said that they assumed who the murderer is. They pointed at him, and soon he was arrested. During the investigation he showed where he buried the body pieces. On October 6, 1999, the Primorsky Krai Court sentenced Krotov to life imprisonment, and in 2001 he was transferred to the Black Dolphin Prison. While in prison, Krotov gave an interview. In it, he admitted to giving alcohol to children, but refused to admit guilt in the production of child pornography, rape and murder. After November 8, 2011, a message appeared in the media about Krotov's death, but this was unconfirmed. In 2015, Krotov tried to unsuccessfully appeal his sentence. = In the media = * Documentary film \\"Sentenced to the Black Dolphin\\" from the series by Vakhtang Mikeladze \\"Sentenced to life\\" See also * List of Russian serial killers  References   External links  * Sentenced to the Black Dolphin Category:1967 births Category:Inmates of Black Dolphin Prison Category:Russian rapists Category:Male serial killers Category:Russian serial killers Category:Murderers of children Category:Living people ","title":"Vadim Krotov"},{"id":"58549291","text":"DYUP is a call sign assigned to two radio stations owned by the University of the Philippines Visayas in the Philippines: * DYUP-AM, an AM radio station broadcasting in Iloilo City * DYUP-FM, an FM radio station broadcasting in Iloilo City ","title":"DYUP"},{"id":"58549335","text":"Nieste may refer to: * Nieste (municipality), in the district of Kassel, in Hesse, Germany * Nieste (river), of Hesse, Germany, tributary of the Fulda ","title":"Nieste"},{"id":"58549344","text":"Pamela Rendi-Wagner (born 7 May 1971) is an Austrian physician and politician serving as the chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party (SP√ñ) since November 2018.

The Baroque theatre now serves for the training of students of acting and opera of the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna (MDW), and for performances of the Musik Theater Sch√∂nbrunn.  History  In the 17th century, theatrical performances were held occasionally at the park of Schloss Sch√∂nbrunn. Maria Theresa commissioned Nicol√≤ Pacassi in 1745 to build an imperial theatre in a wing of the palace, as one of the first palace theatres in Europe. It was opened on 4 October 1747, the name day of her husband, Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor. The empress, who appeared in opera and theatre, watched her children perform in tableaux vivants. The theatre first served the Habsburg court exclusively. Members of the Court Opera performed at the theatre. Operas by Christoph Willibald Gluck premiered there, L'arbre enchant√© in 1759, and Il Parnaso confuso in 1765. Joseph Haydn conducted performances of the Esterhazy orchestra in 1777. When Napoleon Bonaparte had his headquarters in Sch√∂nbrunn, he renovated the theatre. It was reopened in 1809 with Jean Racine's Ph√®dre. Singers of the Theater am K√§rntnertor appeared for emperors and kings during the Congress of Vienna. Under Ferdinand I of Austria, the theatre flourished again, with plays performed by the ensemble of the Burgtheater. In 1898, the palace and theatre were electrified. Before World War I, the building was used as storage for furniture, but after the imperial belongings were stolen in 1919, plays were again performed during the summer by the Burgtheater, directed by Albert Heine, until 1924.. In 1929, the Schlosstheater was given to the Max Reinhardt Seminar as a rehearsal stage, which has used it, together with the opera department of the Universit√§t f√ºr Musik und darstellende Kunst, from October to June. The building underwent major restoration in 1979/80.  Literature  * Ernst Moriz Kronfeld: Das Sch√∂nbrunner Schlo√ütheater. Erster Teil: Von Maria Theresia bis zur Franzosenzeit.

He was repeatedly tried for property crimes according to the Russian Criminal Code, but managed to free himself from prison and returned to Perm early summer of 2013. A week after his release, on June 13 in the Motovilikhinsky City District, Koshcheev killed a drinking companion, and then, in front of the cohabitant of the murdered man, robbed the apartment items worth a total of 600 rubles. On June 24, he took possession of the property of a Perm resident in the amount of 20 thousand rubles through fraud. In the period from June 29 and July 10 in Motovilikha and Svedlovsk, Koshcheev killed four women, three of them associated with rape. The criminal stole money, cell phones and jewelry, and sold them in the Central Market, spending most of the money on alcohol. The total damage from Koshcheev's crimes amount to 80 thousand rubles. On July 11, Koshcheev attacked a girl, but she managed to escape, as the killer was distracted by her cell phone. Koshcheev was arrested on the same day. The surviving victim identified him, and he subsequently confessed and described his crimes in detail. Forensic psychiatric examinations found him sane. On December 31, 2013, the Perm Regional Court found Koshcheev guilty of 5 murders and sentenced him to life imprisonment in a special regime colony. All applications for a pardon were rejected, and the Supreme Court of Russia left the verdict unchanged. He is currently serving his sentence on Ognenny Ostrov, in the Vologda Oblast.

McCarthy is mainly known for her work on Lucian of Samosata and his interactions with the Menippean satire.  Education  McCarthy completed her B.A. at Pembroke College, the private women's college of Brown University, in 1925. Between 1925 and 1927 McCarthy was a postgraduate student at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. She was awarded an M.A. by the University of Missouri in 1927. McCarthy completed her PhD at Yale University in 1929 with a dissertation titled The originality of Lucian's Satiric Dialogues, under the supervision of A. M. Harmon. She was awarded the title of Doctor of Letters by Brown University in 1980.  Career  From 1929 to 1970 McCarthy taught at Wellesley College, where she was Professor of Greek from 1929 to 1955, and Ellen A. Kendall Professor of Greek from 1955 to 1970. In 1934 at Wellesley McCarthy initiated the production of plays in Greek, which she directed. She was lecturer at Holy Cross College between 1970 and 1974, and visiting professor at Brandeis University in 1973. In 1956‚Äì1957 McCarthy was the president of the Classical Association of New England, by which she was later awarded the Barlow-Beach Award for Distinguished Service, in 1978. Barbara McCarthy is mainly known for her work on Menippean satire, and especially for her article 'Lucian and Menippus' (Yale Classical Studies 4: 3‚Äì55), an adaptation of her PhD dissertation. Here McCarthy engaged with the theses of the philologist Rudolf Helm. In the book Lucian und Menipp (1906), Helm claimed that Lucian was heavily indebted to the Cynic Menippus. In her article, Barbara McCarthy did identify similar motives, themes and frames between Lucian's writings and the Menippean fragments. However, she argued that there was no evidence of a close copying of forms and thematic of Menippus' satires by Lucian. Her work supports Lucian's claim of originating his form of satiric dialog. Death and legacy McCarthy died October 28, 1988. In 2000, McCarthy was commemorated by her former student at Wellesley Lynn Sherr in a talk given at the Classical Association of the Atlantic States meeting at Princeton (29 April 2000). In 2004, a panel of the Classical Association of the Atlantic States spring meeting in New York was dedicated to the memory of McCarthy (24 April 2004): New Directions in Research and Teaching on Elementary Greek and Greek Prose Authors, Commemorating the One Hundredth Birthday of Barbara Philippa McCarthy, Ellen A.

The railway will link Kathmandu with Shigatse, Tibet, crossing the China‚ÄìNepal border at Gyirong‚ÄìRasuwa. History In 2006, Qinghai‚ÄìTibet Railway, the first railway in Tibet, was completed. The same year, the then chairman of Tibet Autonomous Region Qiangba Puncog told the current Prime Minister of Nepal Khadga Prasad Oli, then Deputy Prime Minister, that the railway would be extended to Shigatse and eventually to China‚ÄìNepal border. In 2016, during Oli's visit to China, the two countries signed a treaty on trade and transit, including a plan to build a high speed railway from Kathmandu to the Chinese border. In June 2018, Nepal and China agreed on construction of the railway as a component of a series of cooperation projects approved by the two sides. A mutual agreement over the pre-feasibility study was reached in August 2018. First extension of the Tibetan Railway, the Lhasa‚ÄìShigatse railway, opened in 2014. Construction of the railway from Shigatse to Gyirong is expected to be complete by 2022. Route Existing Lanzhou-Kathmandu and Xi'an-Kathmandu freight routes involve cargo being carried by trucks from Shigatse through Gyirong border post to Nepal. This first leg of the route starts from Lanzhou, a major freight hub in the Chinese railway network, to Xining over the Lanzhou‚ÄìQinghai railway (opened 1959), from Xining to Lhasa over the Qinghai‚ÄìTibet railway (opened 2006), and from Lhasa to Shigatse over the Lhasa‚ÄìXigaz√™ railway (opened 2014). Within China, the new railway, which will cross of Chinese territory before reaching the Nepali border, will mostly follow the route of China National Highway 318 after leaving Shigatse, passing through Lhatse, Sa'gya, Dinggy√™, Tingri, and Nyalam. After reaching Nyalam, the railway will follow Highway 219 to Gyirong. The Nepali section is long, and is considered one of the most challenging railway projects due to topographical issues of the Himalayas. 98.5% of the section will be bridges or tunnels. There will be four stations along the line, with the terminal at Sankhu in Kathmandu. A further extension to Pokhara and Lumbini is planned.
