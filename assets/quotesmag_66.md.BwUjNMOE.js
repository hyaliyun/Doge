Personal life D'Arnoult was born the son of Jean (Jan) d'Averhoult, a captain in the Dutch States Army and Gerhardina de Valcke, the daughter of a Groningen burgemeester. The father was a scion of a French Huguenot noble family (he was a Sieur de Guincourt), that was, however, not part of the Dutch nobility. A great-grandmother migrated to the Dutch Republic in 1691 after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 with her children, after her spouse died. The family had become fully acculturated as witnessed by the fact that Jan Anthony was baptized in the Jacobi church of Utrecht, that was in use by the congregation of the Dutch Reformed Church, and not in the √âglise Wallonne. But he was an excellent French speaker. The marriage of his parents went badly, as the father had the mother committed to a borstal-like institution, from which she was only released after his death. During this episode Jan Anthony was cared for by his paternal aunts, especially the spinster Josina Benjamina d'AverhoultWho would later commission the portrait by Louis-L√©opold Boilly, after they had both migrated to France. with whom he would develop a strong attachment. He would never marry.Bruin, pp. 128-129 Career A year after his father's death in 1773 d'Averhoult started his military career as a Cornet with the cavalry regiment Van Eck of the States Army.His brother Pompejus at the same time became an adelborst (cadet) in the Dutch navy. He received his commission as a lieutenant with the same regiment, and was later promoted to ritmeester in another cavalry regiment, Van Tuyl van Serooskerken. But in 1785 he resigned his commission. This may have been prompted by his political sympathies. Like many in the early 1780s in the Netherlands he became very critical of the policies of the stadtholder, William V, Prince of Orange and his regime, that was accused of mismanaging the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. As a Freemason he was a member of the same lodge as Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol, the author of the revolutionary pamphlet Aan het Volk van Nederland, published in 1781, that criticized both the current policies of the regime, and the oligarchic constitution of the Republic, with a regenten-class that monopolized access to political offices. A political movement of opposition to the Orangist, called the Patriots arose, of which d'Averhoult became a member.Bruin, p. 130 In the Spring of 1785 d'Averhoult took a commission in the Turkije company of the Utrecht schutterij that was being rejuvenated by an influx of Patriot Free Corps members. As such he became a leader of the Patriot revolt in Utrecht, together with people like the student leader Quint Ondaatje, that overturned the old vroedschap and replaced it with a popularly elected city council in August 1786. D'Averhoult was elected one of the new members. The Orangist majority in the States of Utrecht did not accept this and moved the States to the Utrecht city of Amersfoort, while the Patriot minority remained in Utrecht. For the time being the Amersfoort States kept hold of the seat of Utrecht province in the States General, however. Meanwhile, the Amersfoort States convinced the stadtholder to garrison Amersfoort with States Army troops under his command. These troops threatened the safety of Utrecht city, as witnessed by the fact that the Amersfoort garrison in early May 1787 made an attempt to occupy the sluice in Vreeswijk, a strategic object. The Utrecht city authorities decided to thwart this attack. D'Averhoult was placed in command of the relief force that marched down to Vreeswijk om 9 May 1787. This resulted in the Battle of Jutphaas, that the Patriots under d'Averhoult's cool-headed leadership won.Bruin, pp. 130-137 Shortly afterward a constitutional crisis erupted in the States General. These were equally divided between three Orangist provinces (Zeeland, Gelderland and Friesland) and three Patriot provinces (Holland, Groningen and Overijssel), while Utrecht was leaning Orangist, and held the balance. In June 1787 the rival Patriot States of Utrecht demanded to be seated in the States General, supported by the three Patriot provincial delegations. Patriot Overijssel temporarily presided at the time, and provisionally seated the Patriot States. This led to riotous behavior by the delegation of the Amersfoort States of Utrecht, one of whose members, drew his sword in the meeting hall, and challenged d'Averhoult, who was a member of the rival Patriot delegation, to a duel. This may or may not have been held the next day in the Hague Wood, fortunately with only slight damage to the participants. The Amersfoort delegation was eventually restored to its position of sole representative of Utrecht in the States General, giving the majority to the Orangists. This was one of the proximate causes of the Prussian invasion of HollandAs a consequence of the loss of a Patriot majority in the States General, the Patriot States of Holland asked for French mediation in the conflict, and this offered an opportunity for Prussia and Great Britain to muscle in on the process, and put their thumbs in the scale in favor of the Orangists. That invasion met little resistance from the Patriots, though d'Averhoult again distinguished himself by repelling several Prussian attacks near fort Nieuwersluis, before his troops were overwhelmed, and he was made a prisoner of war. The Prussians treated him respectfully and he was released and allowed to join the Patriot exodus to Brussels, together with his aunt Josina d'Averhoult.Bruin, pp. 138-139 However, d'Averhoult soon moved on to France, where he claimed his old noble title, and French nationality on the basis of it. On the recommendation of his distant cousin the Marquis de la Fayette, d'Averhoult (now calling himself Jean Antoine) was able to get a commission as a lieutenant-colonel in the French army in February 1788, thanks to the fact that the Edict of Versailles of 1787 made him eligible to serve, even though he remained a Protestant. A few months later he was promoted to colonel. In 1789 he was made a chevalier in the Ordre de M√©rite Militaire .Bruin, pp. 140-141 After the Storming of the Bastille he attached himself to his cousin, the Marquis de la Fayette, and together with the latter became a member of the faction of the Feuillants. In September 1791 d'Averhoult was elected a deputy for the Arrondissement of Sedan, in the Ardennes department in the new National Legislative Assembly.Bruin, pp. 141-142 As a deputy, and member of the Feuillants d'Avernoult opposed the Girondins, who were more radical. But in other respects he was relatively radical. He became a member of the Diplomatic Committee of the Assembly, in which he was a voice for taking an aggressive stance against the surrounding states, in which the French √âmigr√©s were making difficulties for the new constitutional kingdom of France. He did not think that they were a serious threat yet, but he pointed to the example of the suppression of the Patriots in the Netherlands to show that it was better to nip such a threat in the bud. His proposal to have king Louis XVI issue an ultimatum to the German princes sheltering the √©migr√©s was accepted on 29 November 1791.Bruin, p.m 142 But d'Averhoult did not wish or expect that France would go to war right away.Bruin, p. 142 His intervention did contribute to his popularity in the Assembly and on 8 January 1792 he was elected its president for the usual two weeks.This was when his aunt commissioned his portrait by Louis-L√©opold Boilly. Note that he wears the red ribbon of the Ordre de M√©rite Militaire ; as a Protestant he had received the blue ribbon, when he first was given the decoration, but it had recently been changed; Cf. Bruin, p. 142 On 17 January 1792 there was a new debate on declaring war on France's external enemies, in particular Austrian emperor Joseph II. D'Averhoult spoke out against it with the following argument: This argument carried the day: the emperor Joseph was censured, but war was not yet declared. But this was only a temporary delay. The Girondins soon carried the Assembly in forcing a new government on the king, and in April 1792 forcing a declaration of war on emperor JosephBruin, p.144D'Averhoult had meanwhile not forgotten his Dutch compatriots in exile in France. On 19 January 1792 he allowed a deputation of Dutch Patriots to address the Assembly; Bruin, p. 143-144 France radicalized more and more, and the Feuillants lost their influence to the Girondins and the rising Jacobins. D'Averhoult nevertheless spoke out against the illiberal measures that were taken, like the reintroduction of internal passports, and the lawlessness of the Paris Mob. For instance, he spoke out against the lawlessness of the Journ√©e de 20 juin, even in vain demanding the sanctioning of the local authorities who had failed to suppress that riot. But external developments made his position untenable: the Prussians entered the war after issuing an maladroit ultimatum, in which they demanded the reinstatement of the king in his old powers (reminiscent of the demand to reinstate the stadtholder in September 1787). In the following furor d'Averhoult on 26 July announced that he resigned as deputy in the Assembly. He took a commission as Colonel of the 7th regiment of dragoons, and departed for the front in northern France.Bruin, p. 144 The overthrow of the monarchy on 10 August 1792 precipitated the defection of the Marquis de la Fayette. And this brought d'Averhoult under suspicion also. On 18 August a warrant for his arrest was issued by the Assembly. He tried to flee across the border near Sedan, together with a servant, but they were intercepted by armed peasants who demanded to see his passport. In the ensuing fight d'Averhoult managed to shoot his way out (though his servant was arrested). D'Averhoult then tried to escape on his own, but was again intercepted by armed peasants. What happened next remains disputed. At some point someone, either d'Averhoult himself, or someone else, put a pistol to the top of his head and pulled the trigger. He died a few hours later, on 26 August 1792 of this wound in Sedan, where he had been transported, in the presence of his Dutch friend Dani√´l Michiel Gijsbert Heldewier. He was buried in the Protestant cemetery of the Faubourg du Fond de Givonne.Bruin, p. 145 He was mourned by his aunt, who soon returned to the Netherlands.

On 10 May 2018 the Israeli military stated that Iranian forces in Syria launched 20 rockets against Israeli army positions on Western Golan Heights. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that the attack occurred after Baath, a town in the demilitarised zone, was bombarded by Israeli forces. According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) some missiles were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome system, while some fell short in Syrian territory. Following this, Israel launched an extensive strike in Syria against Iranian targets, called Operation House of Cards (; mivtza beit haKlafim ) targeting Iranian military bases in Syria. Syria state media called the attacks an act of Israeli aggression on Syrian territories. Iran denied Israeli claims, stating it had neither fired rockets against Israel nor had any military bases in Syria. During the operation, the Israel Air Force destroyed a number of Syrian air defense batteries, including a Pantsir-S1 system, a S-75 Dvina system, a S-200 missile system radar, and a Buk missile system. The clash came during rising tensions between Israeli and Iranian forces in Syria, including threats by the leader of Iran's Quds Force in Syria, Qasem Soleimani, to attack Israel. The incidents also came just a day after the US announced it was withdrawing from the Iranian nuclear deal.  Background  On 10 February 2018, an Israeli F-16I was shot down by the Syrian air defenses after conducting an air raid on Iran-backed positions inside Syrian territory. The aircraft was part of a larger Israeli aerial dispatch which Israel said was sent in response to detection of an Iranian drone entering Israeli airspace. Two hours after the downing of the jet, Israel began attacking additional targets inside Syria, including air defense sites. On 9 April, Israeli aircraft targeted the T-4 air base in the Syrian province of Homs, killing up to 14 soldiers, including seven Iranians, two days after a reported chemical attack was carried out by the Syrian government. On 30 April 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran to pursue a program of nuclear weapons development. On 8 May 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The same day Israeli air strikes targeted Syrian army positions in the southern Damascus area of Al-Kiswah, killing 15 people, including 8 Iranians according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. According to reports, the targets were Iranian rocket launchers aimed at Israeli territory.  Events  On 10 May, Iranian forces on the Syrian-held side of the Golan Heights reportedly fired around 20 Fajr-5 rockets towards Israeli army positions, though there were no damage or injuries. Abolfazl Hassanbeigi, Vice Chairman of Iran's Supreme National Security Council denied Iran was behind the rocket attack on Israel, stating that \\"Teheran has nothing to do with the missiles launched at Israel from Syria overnight Wednesday\\". According to the Fox News the Iranian missile barrage was done without the notification of the Syrian government. The Israeli army stated that in response, it launched \\"Operation House of Cards\\",‚ÄòOperation House of Cards,‚Äô the IAF mission to cripple Iran‚Äôs presence in Syria , Times of Israel, 11 May 2018.

According to Russia's Defense Ministry, this involved 28 warplanes and the firing of 70 missiles. The Syrian army command stated that most of the missiles launched by Israel had been intercepted. According to Israeli sources, the targets hit by Israel, included Iranian intelligence sites operated by the Quds Force.Gal Perl Finkel, Don't 'poke the bear' in Syria , The Jerusalem Post, October 6, 2018. * Logistics headquarters of the Quds Force. * A military compound and logistics complex of the Quds Force in Kiswah. * An Iranian military camp north of Damascus. * Weapons storage sites belonging to the Quds Force at Damascus International Airport. * Intelligence systems and installations associated with the Quds Force. * Observation, military posts and weapons in the buffer zone. * In addition, the Iranian launcher from which missiles were fired at the Golan Heights was destroyed. The Israel Air Force hit Syrian air defense batteries (SA-5 radar, SA-2, SA-22, SA-17) belonging to the Syrian army, that fired surface-to-air missiles on Israeli warplanes. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated that at least 23 soldiers were killed in Israeli attacks, 5 Syrians and 18 \\"foreigners\\". The IDF estimated that nearly all Iranian infrastructure in Syria was hit. After the incidents, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said, \\"I hope we finished this chapter, and everyone got the message\\". Iranian Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami said, \\"The holy system of the Islamic Republic will step up its missile capabilities day by day so that... if [Israel] does anything foolish, we will raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground.\\" On May 22, Israel's air force commander, Major General Amikam Norkin, reported that Iran fired 32 rocket at Israel during the incidents, while more than 100 surface-to-air missiles were fired from Syria against Israeli jets.

Early life  Morden was born on the 20 July 1880 in Prince Edward County, Ontario, the son of Capt W. H. Morden, of Great Lakes shipping, and Sarah Anne Morden. Morden was educated at Toronto Collegiate Institute and Upper Canada College, followed by the University of Toronto, Harvard University, and the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied law.  Career  During the First World War, he served as a Lieutenant Colonel with the Canadian Expeditionary Force, serving on the Canadian Remount Committee, and as honorary colonel of the 6th Royal Canadian Hussars.Lieutenant-Colonel Grant Morden. The Times (London, England), Monday, Jun 27, 1932; pg. 19; Issue 46170. (333 words) Morden's first business interest was a furniture factory in Farnham, Quebec. He later became involved with finance, moving to England to set up an office in London. Morden built up a large business empire, becoming involved with over 35 companies in the UK, and many others in Canada. Morden was director of the Richelieu and Ontario Navigation Company, the Mexican Mahogany and Rubber Corporation, the New Orleans and Grand Isle Railway Light and Power Co and Pacific Coast Coal Mines, and vice-president of Canada Securities Corporation, Montreal. He co-founded Canada Steamship Lines in 1913, through the merger of 11 smaller companies. He also co-founded the British Commonwealth Union in 1916. Together with Trevor Dawson, managing director of the armaments giant Vickers and a colleague involved with the British Commonwealth Union, Morden was criticised for speculating on the shares of British Celanese, seeking tax breaks and a monopoly over the manufacture of acetate, for the company using undue influence over Reginald McKenna, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Sam Hughes, the Canadian Minister of Militia and Defence. Morden was elected MP for Brentford and Chiswick in the 1918 General Election, and was re-elected four times. He stood down at the October 1931 General Election, having been declared bankrupt in April that year. His financial difficulties towards the end of his life were attributed to the decline in share prices during the Great Depression.  Personal life  Morden married Doris Henshaw in Vancouver in 1909, and they had one son and three daughters. The family lived in Heatherden Hall in Buckinghamshire. The negotiations for the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty took place there while Morden was an MP. Morden died of heart disease on 25 June 1932, aged 51. Heatherden Hall was purchased by Pinewood Studios shortly after his death.

It was pioneered by DJ Tameil and other members of the Brick Bandits crew, who drew inspiration from Baltimore club's hybrid of house and hip hop. Similarly to its Baltimore influences, Jersey club is a fast and aggressive style with tempos near 130-140 BPM but more prominent use of short, chopped samples and triplet kick patterns, resulting in a ‚Äúbouncy‚Äù groove. It is often accompanied by frenetic, competitive dances which have gained global popularity through viral videos. Style and characteristics Jersey club has been described as a \\"fast and aggressive dance music\\" with roots in the Baltimore club scene's fusion of house music and hip hop. By comparison with the Baltimore style, Jersey producers prioritize harder kick sounds and more extensively chopped samples. Producers make use of \\"big kick drum triplets and vocal clips that call out dances, or chopped samples from top rap and R&B; tracks,\\" and construct the tracks on \\"anything from jog shuttle MP3 controllers to turntables and Serato.\\" Common audio programs used are Sony Acid Pro and FL Studio. Billboard described it as \\"repetitive and loud [..] It lands somewhere between New York's vogue and Chicago's juke with a little bit of that nasty from Miami bass.\\" History =Origins: 1999‚Äì2002= Chicago house was popular in Newark's 1990s club scene, where it was referred to by some as \\"club music.\\" Other styles such as ghetto house and juke were also played. By 1999, Baltimore house records such as Tapp's \\"Shake Dat Ass\\" and \\"Dikkontrol\\" were influential, and DJs such as Nix In The Mix, Mustafah, Torry T and Mista Quietman helped to introduce this sound to New Jersey. DJ Tameil, who became known for his Chicago house mixtapes as a teenager, later established connections with the Baltimore scene through Bernie Rabinowitz of the Music Liberated record store; he was subsequently introduced to Baltimore stars such as DJ Technics and Rod Leethe. Tameil did not put artist names on his mixes, making it difficult for other Jersey producers to identify his sources. He began playing Baltimore records at teen parties and clubs in the downtown Newark area. Broad Street in downtown Newark, NJ, where DJ Tameil sold his burned CDs. Tameil was among the first Jersey artists to produce his own club tracks in 2001 with the Dat Butt EP, released on his own label Anthrax Records. A week later the Newark group The OG's also self-released an EP titled Official Ghetto Style. Tameil began to burn his own CDs and sold them on Broad Street in Newark. Around this time, DJs Tim Dolla and Mike V also began producing their own club tracks as the Brick Bandits to challenge Tameil's monopoly on the market. The two parties initially feuded but Tameil later joined the group, coining the phrase \\"Brick City club\\" in 2002 in reference to Newark's nickname \\"Brick City.\\" They released popular mixtapes which featured both club and house tracks. Around this time, Bernie Rabinowitz died and the steady stream of Baltimore releases into New Jersey largely ceased, leaving Jersey artists to develop their own scene. Club parties, hosted primarily in ballrooms and banquet halls, began emerging in Newark and surrounding suburbs such as East Orange and Irvington. Despite violence in the city, parties thrown by the Brick Bandits or at the Branch Brook Skating Rink were known to be safe spaces for kids. =Regional development: 2003‚Äì2009= Many young Newark producers soon began leaving for college or employment, causing there to be a temporary drought of producers around 2003 but spreading the style to other locations. Meanwhile, Tameil, Dolla, and Mike V were utilizing Sony Acid Pro, a digital audio workstation that remains popular with Jersey club producers, to create music and support themselves. Around 2005, a younger generation began to emerge alongside these older producers, with groups like the Partyhoppers of Elizabeth, NJ initially dissing and then joining the Brick Bandits. Around this time, the name of the genre changed to \\"Jersey club\\" to account for its spread beyond Newark, as increasingly popularity on college campuses and the success of Baltimore club raised the scene's profile on the Internet, particularly through Myspace. Around this time, the Jersey style drifted away from the Baltimore template and its palette became more distinctive as younger producer-DJs such as Nadus, Sliink, Jayhood, and R3LL began receiving recognition. R3LL, then a high school student, became known as a promoter of parties and later spread the music to college campuses in North Jersey. Around 2007, Philadelphia began developing its own club scene influenced by the Jersey style. Around 2008, the genre began receiving airplay on major rap and R&B; stations like Hot 97 and Power 105. By 2009, it had spread to 21+ clubs and new, older demographics. Around this time, the scene shifted toward competitive dancing and battling became a central element inspired by DJ Fresh's \\"Get Silly,\\" along with MCing by figures such as Lil Man. Tim Dolla produced a hit track called \\"Swing Dat\\" in reference to the popular dance move, and subsequent dance tracks like DJ Fresh's \\"Get Silly\\" and Jayhood's \\"Patty Cake\\" went viral via YouTube. =International attention: 2010‚Äìpresent= By 2010, electronic music artists from other scenes were drawing influence from the Jersey club sound, including Norwegian producers Cashmere Cat and Lido; LA club producers; \\"festival trap\\" and EDM producers with the support of Mad Decent and Skrillex; and dance artists such as Brenmar and the Night Slugs label roster. Concerns about appropriation of the style have become prevalent, with privileged outsiders coopting the sound to get bookings. R&B; singer Ciara, in her comeback single \\"Level Up,\\" uses a beat structure that is similar to that which is used in Jersey club music.https://revolt.tv/stories/2018/08/22/miami-orleans-jersey- baltimore-influenced-club-music-master-class-0700711837 For DJ Khaled's single \\"To the Max\\", DJ Jayhood even claims that DJ Khaled was inspired by his Jersey club single \\"HeartBroken\\".https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/wjqdqz/jayhood-drake-dj- khaled-sampling-controversy Jersey club also played an essential role during the early and mid-2010s in the development of experimental dance genres, such as deconstructed club. Jersey club became an integral fixture of the alternative NYC party scene and was played at underground parties such as GHE20G0TH1K which served to be essential to the developing sound of deconstructed club music. The style and its direct derivatives have become known on the internet due to music sharing websites and social media such as SoundCloud, YouTube, Vine and Dubsmash across the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. Meanwhile, native Jersey DJs such as Uniiqu3 and DJ Sliink have taken the sound to international audiences, and rave-like parties such as DJ Nadus's #THREAD and Uniiqu3's #135 have incorporated more eclectic formats of club music. When Uniiqu3 began DJing in 2009 at age 18, she was likely the only female DJ in the scene; today, other female producers such as Kayy Drizz and So Dellirious are also present. In December 2014, Newark hosted the Jersey Club awards to honor artists from the scene. In 2019, Uniiqu3 began the PBNJ party series bringing together club artists from Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New Jersey. In 2019, Jersey club artist Unicorn aka Killa Kherk Cobain's song \\"It's Time\\" shifted the Jersey club sound into the hip-hop mainstream after being debuted at the 2019 Summer Jam Concert by Hot 97's DJ Enuff. Unicorn aka Killa Kherk Cobain ks credited as the first to person to rap on a Jersey club record after rapping on his 2007 collaboration with the late DJ K-Swift, \\"Tote It Remix\\". Spin Magazine described Killa Kherk Cobain's fusion of trap rap, house music, and Jersey club as \\"the less innocent side of the Jersey club scene\\". Killa Kherk and his producer DJ Fade (a collective known as \\"Jersey Gods\\") have since lent their unique fusion of Jersey Club/Hip Hop production to mainstream recording artists, including Pop Smoke, Fivio Foreign, Chris Brown, and Swizz Beats. Jersey club artist Cookiee Kawaii's song \\"Vibe\\" was a 2020 viral sensation, sparking worldwide fanfare on the social media app TikTok. Dance culture Strong emphasis on dance accompaniment is a major element in Jersey club culture, as evidenced by performances at Jersey club-centric events, including Essex County's Highlights Festival held annually in the summer. http://thesource.com/2018/07/10/north-jersey-festival-brings-out-the-best-of- jersey-club-culture/ The 2016 Running Man Challenge, a viral meme in which participants filmed and shared short clips of themselves performing a dance resembling running to the 1996 song \\"My Boo,\\" was based on well-known Jersey club moves.

Roosevelt's inaugural address in 1937: \\"I see one- third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished. ‚Ä¶ The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.\\" O. (Osvaldo) Louis Guglielmi (April 9, 1906 ‚Äì September 3, 1956) was an American painter. He was well-known in New York, but soon forgotten after his death, as abstract expressionism came to overshadow artists like him. There are elements of precisionism, surrealism, geometric abstraction, regionalism, and social realism in his work. His paintings often commented on poverty and other social and political themes; bleakness and death appear regularly in his pre-war works. With Walter Quirt and James Guy, he was a prominent exponent of \\"social surrealism\\". After the war, his painting became more planar and abstract, with elements of cubism, and he disavowed the personal sadness in his earlier works in favor of expressing the \\"exuberance and organic means of life itself\\". The New York Times also attributed his decline to his being \\"a relentless borrower, an irrepressible eclectic who seemed to prey voraciously on the styles of others\\". Born in Cairo, Egypt, as a child he lived in Milan and Geneva while his Italian father, a professional violinist, toured the world. In 1914 his parents brought him to the U.S., where they lived in Italian Harlem, New York. He was interested in sculpture at a young age and worked at a casting factory. He attended the National Academy of Design in the evening beginning in 1920, while also attending high school, and attended full-time from 1923 to 1926. The next year he became a naturalized citizen. The Great Depression brought financial hardship, but the difficult times inspired his artwork. From 1935 to 1939, he worked with the Federal Art Project, which supported artists during the Depression. In the 1930s he spent many summers at the MacDowell Colony for artists in Peterborough, New Hampshire. Guglielmi had his first one-man show in 1938, exhibiting his new work Mental Geography. Inspired by the Spanish Civil War‚Äîdepicting a bombed-out Brooklyn Bridge‚Äîit was a warning that European fascism might spread. Guglielmi was part of the 1943 \\"American Realists and Magic Realists\\" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. He was with the Army Corps of Engineers in the war between 1943 and 1945, and did not paint. In the 1950s, he held positions at Louisiana State University, first as a visiting artist and then as an associate professor. He died in 1956 of a heart attack in Amagansett, New York.

She successfully campaigned for tighter restrictions on child marriage in her home state of Florida. Prior to 2018, pregnant children of any age in Florida could get married with a judge's permission. With the passage of the 2018 legislation, children under 17 are prohibited from getting married. Early life and first marriage Johnson grew up in Tampa, Florida. She was an only child, and her household consisted of her, her mother, and her mother's husband. They lived in the parsonage of their conservative Pentecostal church. Beginning at age 8, Johnson was repeatedly raped by the bishop and deacon of her church. Johnson was also raped by her mother's husband. She became pregnant as a result of rape at age 10. The pregnancy was not recognized until she was 7 months along in gestation. Johnson's mother did not support or believe her statements that she was raped, and did not accompany her to the hospital when it was time to deliver the baby. Johnson's mother arranged for her to marry the deacon who had raped her, Alfonsa Tolbert, so that he could avoid criminal charges. At the time, 16- and 17-year-old minors could get married with parental permission in Florida, and children of any age could be married with the permission of a county judge if a pregnancy was involved. While the first judge refused to license the marriage of a child so youngthough it was legal a second judge agreed to grant the license and Johnson was married to Tolbert on March 29, 1971, at age 11. Johnson had six children by the time she was 17-years-old, and had to drop out of school after ninth grade to raise them. At age 17, she sought help from the Legal Aid Society, which gave her $75 to pay for an attorney for her divorce After first divorce At age 19, Johnson remarried a man 18 years her senior. Together, they had three children. They were married for 26 years before separating in 2002. Activism Johnson published a book detailing her experience as a child bride, Forgiving the Unforgivable. She is opposed to child marriage on the basis that children cannot enter into other legal contracts. Johnson stated, \\"You can't get a job, you can't get a car, you can't get a license, you can't sign a lease, so why allow someone to marry when they're still so young?\\" Johnson also believes that permitting child marriage allows rapists to escape the legal consequences of their crimes by marrying their victims. Speaking on how she was forced to marry the man who raped her, Johnson said, \\"No one actually protected me. They protected him by putting the handcuffs on me, instead of putting the handcuffs on him, and he was the rapist.\\" In 2012, Johnson began to lobby the Florida state legislature to make child marriage illegal. Johnson initially faced opposition or disbelief from lawmakers, with some lawmakers incorrectly asserting to her that child marriage such as hers was not legal in Florida, or that her case was anomalous. However, Johnson's ideas gained traction with lawmakers over time. After the Florida Senate voted unanimously to ban child marriage, Senator Lizbeth Benacquisto called Johnson \\"the reason for the bill.\\" The proposed ban on child marriage was amended, however, to allow 17-year-olds to marry. 17-year-olds can marry in the state of Florida, regardless of if a pregnancy is involved, as long as their intended partner is less than two years older than they are. Such couples would also have to take a premarital preparation course, as well as sign an affidavit that the marriage is not coerced. If a pregnancy is involved, the couple must receive additional counseling. This amended legislation again passed unanimously in the Senate; in the House, support was near-unanimous, with George Moraitis the lone dissenter. Moraitis stated, \\"I'm particularly focused on the pregnancy aspect of it. I don't want the message to be that it's better to not get married.\\" On 23 March 2018, this legislation (Senate Bill 140) was signed by Governor Rick Scott. Despite the lack of an outright ban on child marriage in Florida, Johnson stated that she was pleased with the bill, saying, \\"I can deal with the line of [age] 17 with all of the requirements.\\" While she was happy with the legislative victory in Florida, Johnson indicated that her activism against child marriage was not over. She stated, \\"My mission is for the world, for the children all over the world,\\" she said. \\"It's not just Florida . . . It's for the children everywhere.\\" References Category:Living people Category:1960 births Category:American human rights activists Category:Child marriage in the United States Category:Activists from Florida Category:People from Tampa, Florida ","title":"Sherry Johnson"},{"id":"57380304","text":"Proven Innocent is an American legal drama television series created by David Elliot, which premiered on February 15, 2019, on Fox. The series follows the employees of a wrongful conviction law firm and stars Rachelle Lefevre, Russell Hornsby, Nikki M. James, Vincent Kartheiser, Riley Smith, Kelsey Grammer, and Clare O'Connor. On May 11, 2019, Fox canceled the series after one season. Premise Proven Innocent follows a wrongful conviction firm. Led by Madeline Scott, a lawyer who, along with her brother, was wrongfully convicted for murdering her friend during their youth, the team reopens investigations to exonerate convicts that were 'proven' guilty. Cast and characters =Main= * Rachelle Lefevre as Madeline Scott, a lawyer specializing in wrongful convictions, driven by the experience of spending ten years in prison for the murder of her best friend Rosemary, even though she didn't commit it. She studied for pre-law while in prison and graduated Yale at the top of her class once she was released. She is sometimes prone to becoming overzealous in attempting to achieve her goals, but has made it clear more than once that she draws a line between 'not guilty' and 'innocent', constantly determined to prove her clients' innocence due to the challenges they would face if released under 'not guilty'.  Clare O'Connor as Young Madeline Scott * Russell Hornsby as Ezekiel \\"EZ\\" Boudreau, a former reinsurance lawyer who got Madeline's conviction overturned and now works as a senior member of her firm. He was the 2,736th lawyer Madeline wrote to when trying to prove her innocence while in prison (based on the number at the bottom of the letter Madeline sent him). He is religious, but has shown a willingness to compromise his religious views in extreme cases; for example, while he objects to abortion, he agrees that a twenty-five year sentence was too extreme for a mother accused of killing her baby. * Nikki M. James as Violet Bell, the firm's media consultant and the host of a podcast. She often offers advice on how they might present a case to the public, based on countering Madeline's own experience when she was presented as a party girl after the death of Rosemary when that night was the first time Madeline drank at all. * Vincent Kartheiser as Bodie Quick, the firm's chief investigator. He has shown a fondness for going undercover even when a simpler approach might be better, and displays a wide range of skills. * Riley Smith as Levi Scott, Madeline's brother who struggles with an oxycodone addiction resulting from the trauma of imprisonment. Unlike his sister, he has struggled to move on from his conviction. * Kelsey Grammer as Gore Bellows, the Cook County state attorney, whose celebrated career has long been shadowed by allegations of multiple wrongful convictions, including those of Madeline and Levi Scott. He is generally shown as going for the easiest solution to cases even when alternatives are possible, preferring a quick and easy trial to more in-depth investigations, although he attempts to present himself as merely misguided or misinformed when Madeline's team proves him wrong, such as when they confirmed that one conviction was based on a translator deliberately doctoring the transcript of a preacher who didn't speak English to create the impression that the man claimed his wife never wanted children when Bellows sentenced her to prison for killing her child. =Recurring= * Elaine Hendrix as Susan Andrews, a high-profile reporter linked to the Bellows campaign. * Laurie Holden as Greta Bellows, Gore's shrewish wife. She often encourages him to attack Madeline in his own campaign for attorney general, but Bellows resists this idea to avoid making Madeline's case a major issue. * Caitlin Mehner as Heather Husband (n√©e Dupinski), a relative of Rosemary Lynch who believes in Madeline's guilt and derides her as a criminal, to the point that her husband deliberately provoked Levi into attacking him just to ruin Levi's chances of staying out of jail. * Tembi Locke as Vanessa Dale * Tiffany Dupont as Nikki Russo, a cop and Bodie's love interest from whom he occasionally solicits favors. They break up when Bodie uses evidence she gave him to take down a dirty cop, which she views as a breach of trust. * Catherine Lidstone as Isabel Sanchez, a young, hungry prosecutor who views Bellows as a mentor. She is essentially a \\"counterpart\\" to Madeline as their lives were each ruined by a flawed court case, albeit from different sides; where Madeline was wrongfully convicted of a crime she did not commit, Sanchez's mother was killed by a man who was cleared of an assault charge just a month prior to her mother's death, with Bellows as the prosecuting attorney. * Candice Coke as Wren Grant, an inmate and Madeline's prison lesbian girlfriend. * Jeffrey Nordling as Rick Zahn alias Ravi, cult leader and rapist, main donor to Bellows campaign Episodes Production =Development= On August 4, 2017, it was announced that Fox had given the production, then titled Infamy, a script plus penalty commitment.

Date  Mushika-vamsha is believed to have been written during the reign of the Mushika ruler Shrikantha, who is assumed to be a contemporary of the 11th century Chola ruler Rajendra I (see Historicity below). If this belief is true, Mushika- vamsha is the earliest known historical Sanskrit mahakavya, pre-dating Kalhana's Rajatarangini by a few decades. Indologist A. K. Warder classifies Atula's style as Vaidarbhi, and believes that he was influenced by the 6th century poet Bharavi, among others.  Plot  = Origin of the dynasty = Atula provides a mythological origin of the Mushika dynasty, tracing its descent to a Heheya queen, whose family was killed during Parashurama's slaughter of the Kshatriya rulers. The pregnant queen initially wanted to commit suicide, but her family preceptor dissuaded her from doing so, encouraging her not to destroy her unborn baby. With the help of the preceptor, the queen fled southwards, and came to the coastal region that later became the Mushika kingdom. There, she was attacked by a huge rat (mushika), who was actually the divine spirit of the Eli mountain (Ezhimala), and had been cursed by the sage Kaushika to become a rat. The queen burned the rat to ashes with the flame emitted from her eyes: the rat was thus redeemed, and became transformed into its original form. = Rama, the dynasty's founder = At the request of the divine spirit, the queen started living in a cave of the mountain, protected from Parashurama. There, she gave birth to a boy, who received education from the preceptor. By the time the prince grew up, Parashurama had wiped the Kshatriyas from the earth 21 times. Feeling sorry for their widows, he decided to perform a ritual sacrifice to absolve himself from the sin of killing the Kshatriyas at the Eli mountain. For one of the sacrificial ceremonies, he needed a Kshatriya prince. The divine spirit of the mountain brought to him the Heheya prince, who belonged to the lunar dynasty. After the end of Parashurama's ceremony, the prince was crowned as a king, and thus, became the founder of the Mushika dynasty. Since Parashurama performed his consecration with the holy water from a ghata (earthen pot), the king came to be known as Rama-ghata-mushika. The first six cantos deal with the exploits of Rama. He established a council of ministers, and his favourite minister was Mahanavika (\\"great sailor\\"), a member of the trading class (Shreshti) of Mahishmati. Rama also established the fortified city of Kolam, and the Mushika rulers came to be known as Kolabhupas. Once, he visited the hermitage of Parashurama, who gave him an invincible bow called Ajita and several divine missiles. Meanwhile, he received the news that his ancestral Heheya kingdom had been conquered by the Magadhas. Rama wanted to march against Magadha, but his ministers advised him to subjugated the southern kingdoms first. After consolidating his rule in southern India, Rama crossed the Vindhya mountain, and asked the Magadha ruler Suvarman to hand over the former Heheya territory to him. When Suvarman refused, the two kings fought a battle in which Suvarman used divine missiles, but Rama could counter him without use of Parashurama's divine missiles. Ultimately, Rama defeated and killed him in a duel. The vassals of Magadha accepted his suzerainty. He married Suvarman's daughter, and restored the Magadha territory to Suvarman's son. Gradually, Rama conquered the entire Bharata (India) and \\"the islands\\", and became a Chakravartin (universal emperor). He appointed his elder son Vatu as the ruler of the Heheya kingdom, and returned to Kola with his younger son Nandana. At Kola, he performed a horse sacrifice, and after a long time, retired to penance, crowning Nandana as the new king of the Mushika kingdom. = Nandana and his successors = The Cantos 7-10 describe the \\"amorous exploits\\" of Nandana: the poet describes him as a mighty and glorious monarch, but does not describe his achievements as a king. Nandana was succeeded by Ugra; Canto 11 lists the names of the next 51 rulers (all patrilineal descendants). Ugrasena, the sixth successor of Nandana, repulsed an invasion from the Kerala Kingdom. His successor Chitrasena was killed by a lion during a hunting expedition. The next ruler Shatasoma, described as a descendant of the solar dynasty, performed a hundred horse sacrifices. On the advice of sage Agastya, he visited Kailasha and brought a sacred idol of the god Shiva. This idol was installed in a newly-constructed shrine at Celera (also known as Cellura, Taliparamba or Lakshmipura). Shatasoma's descendant Sharmadatta obtained the boon of living as long as he wished from Shiva, for himself and his 20 descendants. His descendant Vatukavarman built the large Vatukeshvara Shiva temple at Alashuddhi. His successor Ahirana built the Ahiraneshvara Shiva temple on the western bank of the P·πõthana river (identified as Valapattanam). Ahirana's son Ranabhara was attracted some girls while chasing elephants in the Sahya mountains. He followed them into a big cave, spent some days with a thousand cave girls, and then brought them to his kingdom using an elixir. After the birth of his son Aryagupta, he entered the cave once again, accompanied by many women. Aryagupta's son Achala built the city of Achalapattana on the Eli mountain. His younger son Vikramasena ascended the throne after expelling the elder son Ashvasena from the kingdom. Vikramasena's son Vinayavarman ruled by dharma, and the next ruler Rajavarman built a Buddhist monastery (vihara) called Rajavihara. Ashvasena's son Jayamanin I became the next ruler with the help of an army from the Pandya kingdom. Jayamanin's grandson Udayavarman patronized Brahmins. The next ruler Virochana I killed a Pallava king, and married his daughter Harini. Two of his descendants - Shashidatta and Janavrata - killed each other in order to seize the throne. Nothing is known about the last 38 kings mentioned in the Canto 11, except their names. = Kunchivarman and Ishanavarman = Canto 12 begins with the reign of Kunchivarman, whose daughter married the ruler of the neighbouring Kerala Kingdom. His son Ishanavarman married Nandini, the daughter of a Chedi king who had been dethroned. Ishanavarman led an army to Chedi, and restored the throne to his father-in-law. Upon his return to the Mushika kingdom, he faced an invasion from the Kerala king Jayaraga. The warring kings decided to engage in a personal combat, but the Kerala prince Goda and Ishanavarman's nephew negotiated a peace treaty between the two kingdoms. Ishanavarman and Nandini did not have any children, so he married a Chola princess, with whom he had a son named Nrparama (or Nrpavarman). = Nandini's descendants = An upset Nandini prayed to the goddess Bhadrakali (or Chandika), and obtained a boon that the Mushika throne would be passed on to the sons of the female members of her family. (The manuscript is mutilated here, but it is clear that the Goddess says something about women: the editor theorized that the goddess talks about matrilineal descent, which is what effectively happens in the subsequent portions of the text.) Sometime later, she gave birth to a son named Palaka, and a daughter named Nandini (II). To avoid a war of succession between Nrparama and Palaka, Ishanavarman sent Palaka to the Chedi kingdom. Ishanavarman patronized scholars, and built several Shiva temples. Towards the end of his life, he suffered from a severe fever, and died after performing a Mahadana (\\"Great Donation\\") ceremony. The ministers then appointed Nrparama as the new king, whose infant son Chandravarman became the titular ruler after his death. Taking advantage of this situation, the Kerala king invaded the Mushika kingdom, whose ministers recalled Palaka from Chedi. Palaka repulsed the invasion, slaughtered the enemies on the battlefield, and became the king. He was succeeded by Validhara, the son of his sister. Validhara defended his kingdom against the Ganga invaders, and was succeeded by his maternal nephews, first Ripurama, and then Vikramarama. Vikramarama build a huge wall of large rocks to prevent a Buddha (Jina) shrine from being swalloed by the Arabian Sea. (This temple remains unidentified, and was probably lost to the sea in the later years.) His successors were Janamani, Samghavarman (or Shankhavarman), Jayamani (Jayamanin II), and Valabha I. Valabha I, described in Canto 13, was a powerful warrior king, who subjugated the chieftain of Bhatasthali, and made his relative Nrparama the in-charge of that territory. His younger brother and successor Kundavarman built the Narayananapura city and a Vishnu temple in that city. The next ruler Palaka was a son of a sister of Kundavarman. At the time of his death, Palaka did not have an adult younger brother or a maternal nephew. He was succeeded by Ripurama, a chieftain of Bhatasthali. After a glorious reign, Ripurama was succeeded by Gambhira, a son of Palaka's sister. Gambhira was a strong ruler, who crushed a revolt by the subordinate chief of Marupura, and burnt down that city. = Vallabha II = Jayamani (Jayamanin III), the successor and younger brother of Gambhira, became a renowned ruler. During the last years of his reign, he was assisted in administration by his nephew, the crown prince Valabha II. Valabha II, said to be an incarnation, partially that of Shiva and partially that of Vishnu, made grants to the Vedic agrahara of Cellura. This agrahara is described as a hermitage with a variety of trees. At Cellura, there were two head brahmanas (priests) named Bhava and Nandin, said to have descended from the heavens. They are compared to Shukra and Brihaspati (the teachers of the Asura and Devas respectively, in Hindu mythology). Vallabha visited the \\"cities\\" (shrines) of Vishnu and Shiva, the latter of which had been built by the earlier king Shatasoma, and paid obeisance to the deities. He commissioned repairs to these two temples, which had decayed with age, and gave benedictions to the brahmanas before leaving. Jayamani made Vallabha his heir apparent, and then asked him to march to aid the Kerala king, who was preparing to attack the Chola king. Vallabha had to abandon the march midway, when a loyal subject told him that Jayamani had died, and an enemy named Ramavikrama had usurped the throne. Vallabha sent an envoy to the Kerala king, and then turned back towards the Mushika capital. On the way back, he visited the Mulavasa shrine, and paid obeisance to the Buddha. Vallabha's army defeated Ramavikrama's forces in a fierce battle. Vallabha punished the surviving dissidents, and took control of the Mushika kingdom. The poet describes his coronation and construction activities in detail. Vallabha built the city of Marahi, an international commercial port, at the mouth of the Killa river. He also built the Vallabhapatnam fort, named after himself. He installed a statue of Shiva at the Vatukeshvara temple. His army crossed the ocean, and conquered many islands. = Shrikantha = Vallabha II was succeeded by his younger brother Shrikantha (IAST: ≈örƒ´ka·πá·π≠ha) alias Rajavarman. He commissioned restoration of the Vatukeshvara, Kharavana, and Ahiraneshvara temples. He restored the wealth that the enemies had plundered from the temples, and paid obeisance to Shiva. The extant text breaks off after a description of the Shiva worship and rituals.  Historicity  The poet Atula was primarily focused on eulogizing the dynasty's rulers, rather than on describing their reign based on the historical facts. The first six cantos, which are about the dynasty's founder Rama, describe an ideal ruler rather than a historical figure. There is no evidence that a ruler from present-day Kerala conquered Magadha or other regions of northern India. Although the text's description of the dynasty's origin is purely legendary, some historians, such as M. G. S. Narayanan, believe that it indicates northern origins of the dynasty. Narayanan theorizes that the Mushika family may have migrated from the Heheya kingdom of Cenral India to Kerala at the beginning of the Mauryan rule. Nandana of Atula's text may be same as Nannan, a king described in the Tamil Sangam literature, but this cannot be said with certainty. According to the Sangam literature, Nannan ruled Ezhilmalai (Eli mountain), and fought many battles against the neighbouring rulers. However, Atula does not credit Nandana with any military achievements. Indologist A. K. Warder notes that the story of Shiva's boon (of living as long as they wished) to Sharmadatta and his 20 successors solves the chronological inconsistencies arising from dating the dynasty's origin to Parashurama's time, by allowing as much as hundred years for the kings' lifespans. All of these kings appear to be imaginary. Canto 12 onwards, the text describes rulers who can be identified as historical figures. However, not all of the events described in this and subsequent cantos are historical. For example, Ishanavarman's purported march to Chedi is of doubtful historicity, although his conflict with the Kerala king seems to have some historical basis. Shrikantha is identified with king Kandan (Kantan) Karivarman mentioned in the Eramam inscription, which records the Samayasanketam ceremony conducted at the Chalappuram temple during Kandan's reign. The inscription also mentions Rajendra-chola Samayasenapati of Kadappappalli, who is identified as the 11th century Chola king Rajendra. The Mushika-vamsha mentions that Shrikantha restored the temples that had been plundered by the enemies, and then ends abruptly after describing the worship rituals at the restored temples. It appears that the Chola king Rajendra successfully invaded Kerala around 1020, and Atula has omitted this fact to avoid spoiling his glorious description of Vallabha's reign. Shrikantha seems to have restored the temples in the aftermath of this first Chola invasion, as described in the Mushika-vamsha and the Eramam inscription. The Kerala kingdom subsequently rebelled against Rajendra's overlordship, leading to a second Chola invasion around 1028, in which both the Kerala king and Kandan were killed.

The chair, currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, belonged to the Egyptian scribe Reniseneb.  Description  The Chair was crafted circa 1450 B.C during the reign of Thutmose III, sixth Pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. Inscriptions on the chair indicate it belonged to the scribe Reniseneb (also referred to as Reni-seneb or Renyseneb). The chair is made from ebony and carved ivory. It is believed that the chair was originally less detailed then it currently is, and that additional inscriptions were added to the chair when Reniseneb died. The chair is notably the oldest (excluding royal chairs) surviving chair of its style from Egypt. The seat of the chair is a reproduction made from woven reeds, as the original seat has long since decayed. An image of Reniseneb seated in a similar chair is carved into the backrest of the chair, and its feet take the form of carved lion claws. Lotus flowers are also depicted on the chair's carved ivory, possibly due to Egyptian's association of lotus flowers with rebirth and healing.

It is known from a single manuscript discovered in the present-day Kerala state of India. Its style and language suggest that it was composed around the 3rd century. The portion supposedly containing the name of the playwright is damaged, but the name appears to be a feminine one (read by some scholars as \\"Vijjakaya\\"), although this cannot be said with certainty. Several scholars have made attempts to identify the play's characters with historical personalities, but most modern scholars believe it to be a work of fiction. The play narrates the story of prince Kalyanavarman of Magadha, whose adopted brother Chandasena forms an alliance with the rival Lichchhavis, and treacherously attacks Magadha. Kalyanavarman's father Sundaravarman dies in the attack, and his mother Madiravati commits suicide by self-immolation. The orphaned young prince is taken to safety by his nurse Vinayandhara and other loyalists, and spends several years in exile in the Vindhya forest. When he grows up, his loyal minister Mantragupta instigates the Shabhara and the Pulinda tribes to rebel against Chandasena, and while Chandasena is busy curbing the revolt, stages a coup in the capital Pataliputra. Chandasena is killed, and Kalyanavarman becomes the new king. He marries the Shurasena princess Kirtimati, whom he had met during his exile.  Authorship and date  Kaumudi-Mahotsava was discovered from a single manuscript from Kerala. The manuscript was partially damaged by worms, and had a hole at the place that appears to state the beginning of the author's name in the prologue. The visible part of the author's name can be read as (\\"-kayƒÅ\\"); the ending syllable suggests that this is a feminine name. Scholar Manavalli Ramakrishna Kavi (1866-1957) saw the remains of what he believed to be \\"ja\\", and read the name as \\"jakayƒÅ\\", although Indologist A. K. Warder finds this reading doubtful. Based on Kavi's reading and the space occupied by the hole, some scholars have theorized that the author was \\"VijjakayƒÅ\\", identifying her with the poetess Vijja, who in turn, is sometimes identified with Vijaya, the daughter-in-law of the 7th century Chalukya king Pulakeshin II. However, Warder notes that the word could have been another name, such as \\"MorikayƒÅ\\". Alternatively, the broken word may not be a name at all: it is possible that the sentence containing it states that \\"the play was composed with a sub-plot patƒÅkayƒÅ\\". An analysis of the play's style and language indicates that it was definitely not authored by the poetess Vijja: the play resembles the works of earlier authors such as Bhasa (3rd or 4th century). It may have been composed somewhat later by an imitative writer, but it is highly unlikely to have been composed in as late as the 9th (or even the 6th) century.  Plot  = Act I = Kalyanavarman, the exiled prince of Magadha, is living in the hermitage of Jabali, near Lake Pampa in the Vindhyas. His loyal minister Mantragupta is living in disguise in Pataliputra, the capital of Magadha. Once, while sitting under an Ashoka tree near the temple of goddess Chandika, the prince recalls his childhood, and wonders if his memories are a dream or an illusion. Meanwhile, Kirtimati, the beautiful daughter of the Shurasena king Kirtisena, visits the temple. She rests under the same Ashoka tree, and is romantically attracted to Kalayanavarman. Yogasiddhi, a nun and the guide of Kirtimati, informs her that her residence in the hermitage is ready. As the princess leaves, she glances at Kalyanavarman in a way that makes her passion for him evident. Meanwhile, Vaikhanasa, Kalyanavarman's jester (vidushaka) arrives, and informs him that Mantragupta's plan is going well. The prince describes princess Kirtimati to him, but the fool thinks of this encounter as the final disaster to strike the prince after the loss of the kingdom. Vaikhanasa sees what he thinks is a heap of rice, but turns out to be a broken pearl necklace dropped by the princess. At this time, the prince is called for his mid-day exercise. = Act II = Princess Kirtimati becomes infatuated with Kalyanavarman, and unable to sleep, paints his portrait. The prince also becomes lovesick, and starts neglecting his meals. Yogasiddhi becomes concerned at the state of the princess. Meanwhile, she recalls her own past: she became a nun after her family suffered a disaster, and came to the Shurasena capital Mathura, where the Queen liked her and made her the caregiver of the princess. As Yogasiddhi thinks about her past, a hawk grabs the portrait of Kalyanavarman and drops it near her. Yogasiddhi recognizes Kalyanavarman, and recalls that she used to be his nurse when he was a young boy: she became a nun after his family lost the throne of Magadha. Yogasiddhi faints, and is revived by Kirtimati's confidante Nipunika. Yogasiddhi vows to unite the lovers, and writes a verse on the painting, declaring that Kirtimati is as worthy of Kalyanavarman, as Bandhumati of Shaunaka, and Kurangi of the Avimaraka (characters from well- known stories). Meanwhile, Vaikhanasa comes to the residence of the princess, and returns the pearl necklace to Nipunika. Yogasiddhi recognizes him and gives him the portrait of Kalyanavarman. = Act III = The prince asks Vaikhanasa about Kirtimati's necklace. Vaikhanasa pretends to have lost it, and instead shows him the painting. The prince paints a portrait of Kirtimati beside his portrait, while Vaikhanasa tells him about Yogasiddhi, the writer of the verse, being his childhood nurse. = Act IV = In Pataliputra, Mantragupta's agents prepare for a coup against the usurper Chandasena, who is busy dealing with a diversion organized at the frontier by Mantragupta. (Mantragupta had instigated the Shabhara and the Pulinda tribes to rebel against Chandasena). Kalyanavarman's loyalists plan to appoint him as the new king. The son of the chaplain of Kalyanavarman's father narrates how Chandasena usurped the power: An adopted son of Kalyanavarman's father Sundaravarman, he entered into a marriage alliance with Lichchhavis, the enemies of the Magadha dynasty. He subsequently attacked Magadha: in the ensuing conflict, Sundaravarman and several of his ministers were killed. Queen Madiravati, the mother of Kalyanavarman, suicide by self-immolation. Chandasena conquered the capital, and became the new ruler of Magadha. The orphaned prince Kalyanavarman escaped the capital with his nurse Vinayandhara and other loyalists, including the sons of the ministers. Mantragupta describes the evening in Pataliputra, and at night, he receives the news that Kalayanavarman will arrive in the city in the morning. He sends the Chaplain's son to Mathura to arrange Kirtimati's marriage to the prince, as a surprise gift for the prince at his coronation. A voice then proclaims the arrival of the prince, and the coup starts at the daybreak. = Act V = The audience learn that Kalyanavarman has conquered the kingdom, Chandasena has been killed, and the celebrations are being organized. A gambler returning from Mathura states that Kirtisena is sending Kirtimati to Pataliputra. Meanwhile, Kalyanavarman longs for Kirtimati, not realizing that she is already in Pataliputra, where Yogasiddhi has hidden in the grove of the Suganga palace. Kirtisena's chaplain enters the court, and announces that Kirtisena has offered to marry Kirtimati to Kalyanavarman. He presents the pearl necklace (mentioned in Act I) to Kalyanavarman, and narrates the story of its origin as follows: the necklace was made from the temples of an elephant killed by Arjuna during the Bharata battle. Arjuna appointed at Vrishni prince as the king of Shurasena, and gave the necklace to him. The necklace was inherited by the present-day royals of Mathura. Kalyanavarman wears the necklace and visits the grove, where Nipunika brings Kirtimati to him. The drama is said to have been staged on the occasion of coronation of Kalyanavarman, on a full-moon day, resulting in the name of the play (\\"Full-Moon Festival\\").  Historicity  Historian Edward Aloysius Pires connected the play's characters with the Maukhari rulers, whose names ended in -varman. Pires identified Chandasena as the Gupta king Chandragupta I (who married a Lichchhavi princess). According to Pires, the play was commissioned by a Maukhari ruler named Kalyanavarman, on the occasion of his coronation in 326 CE. However, this identification is not corroborated by any concrete historical evidence. No Maukhari rulers (or any other rulers named Sundaravarman, Kalyanavarman and Chandasena) are known to have ruled Magadha during the 3rd or 4th centuries. Historian K. P. Jayaswal theorized that Sundaravarman's family was another dynasty that ruled Magadha before the Guptas. He identified Chandasena as Chandragupta I, and Kalyanavarman as a prince of the Kota family, which was subjugated by Chadnragupta's son Samudragupta. However, this identification is incorrect, as the play explicitly states that Chandasena was killed and his dynasty ended when the forces loyal to Kalyanavarman conquered the capital. Chandragupta lived to an old age, and passed on the throne to his son. Moreover, the play does not describe Sundaravarman or Kalyanavarman as members of the Kota family. Jayaswal's theory has been rejected by most scholars. Numismatist P. L. Gupta identified Sundaravarman and Kalyanavarman as last two kings of the Satavahana dynasty. He interpreted \\"Karniputra\\", a word mentioned in the play, as \\"Satakarni-putra\\" (Satakarni was a title common to several Satavahana kings). However, \\"Karniputra\\" is actually a typo in the manuscript - the play mentions \\"Karni-patra\\" (the leaves of karnikara), which had been used to make the victory arches. Moreover, no Satavahana king had a name ending in -varman, and no historical source describes the Satavahana dynasty as Magadha-kula (which, according to the play, was the name of Kalyanavarman's dynasty). Several other scholars have determined that Sundaravarman (or Sundaravarma) and Kalyanavarman (or Kalyanavarma) are not historical figures at all, and have categorized the drama as a work of fiction.

Dr. Rosa Slade Gragg (30 April 1904 - 19 February 1989) was a United-States-based activist and politician. She founded the first black vocational school in Detroit, Michigan; and was the advisor to three United States presidents. She was inducted in 1987 into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.  Life and education  Gragg was born on April 30, 1904 in Hampton, Georgia to Willis O. Slade and Sarah V. Haynes Slade, the oldest of seven children. Her father was a minister. She received her grade school education in Georgia, going on to Morris Brown College in Atlanta, Georgia where she graduated summa cum laude. She went on to study at Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), the University of Michigan and Wayne State University. On June 10, 1926 she married Detroit businessman James Robert Gragg. They had one child named James R. Gragg Jr., who went on to become a lawyer and a judge in Michigan. Her husband died on December 16, 1956. She died on February 19, 1989 after a long illness.  Career and activism  After graduating, Gragg became a teacher in Eatonton, Georgia. She later became principal of Eatonton High School; and later principal of Acworth High School. In the 1930s, Gragg became friends with Eleanor Roosevelt, and worked to improve racial relations. Around this time, Gragg became head of the English department at Central Park College in Savannah, Georgia. Gragg was good friends with Mary McLeod Bethune, who was the founder of the National Council of Negro Women. This friendship led Gragg to become an organizer and founder of organizations aimed at black women, organizing multiple programs around Detroit. Gragg started to become involved in clubs after joining the Current Topic Study Club in 1926. In 1941, Gragg bought a house in Detroit, which she used as a meeting place for clubs. Neighbors became angry at her purchase, and Gragg was forced to close off the front door and make the side door the main entrance for the house. In 1942, Gragg was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to a national advisory board of the Federal Office of Civil Defense, entitled the Board of the National Volunteer's Participation Committee of Civil Defense. Gragg was the only black person to serve on the board at the time. In 1943, Michigan Governor Murray Van Wagoner appointed her the advisor on race relations to the Michigan Office of Civil Defense. In 1947, Gragg founded the Slade-Gragg Academy of Practical Arts with her husband. The school was the first black vocational school in Detroit. The school was called the \\"Tuskegee of the North\\" and trained over 2,000 women and veterans. It closed in 1952. The school was open to all people of all races. The school offered classes in trades, including tailoring, dress-making, and food production and service. In 1949, Detroit mayor Eugene Van Antwerp appointed Gragg as the president of the Commission of the Detroit Department of Public Welfare. She was the first black person named to be head of the committee. The commission had an operating budget of 20 million dollars and nearly 2,000 employees. During World War II, Gragg served as president of the Detroit Association of Colored Women's Clubs. This organization was incorporated into the National Association of Colored Women 20 years later. At its peak under her leadership in 1945, the club had 73 clubs as members and 3,000 members. Gragg became the 16th president of the National Association of Colored Women in 1958, after becoming vice-president in 1957. Gragg was the president from 1958 to 1964. In 1960, she commissioned historian Charles H. Wesley to write the history of the National Association of Colored Women. The book was published in 1984, and entitled The History of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs: A Legacy of Service. In 1960, Gragg was selected to be on the National Women's Advisory Committee of the Treasury Department by President John F. Kennedy. In 1961, Kennedy appointed her to the President's Commission On the Status of Women. Kennedy also appointed her to the National Women's Committee on Civil Rights and the Commission on Employment of the Handicapped. In 1961, the National Association of Colored Woman worked toward preserving and restoring Frederick Douglass's home in Washington, D.C. Gragg launched the restoration campaign at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., where numerous politicians were in attendance. Also in attendance was Douglass's adopted grandson, Joseph K. Douglass. The club was successful in their pursuit, and in 1962 Senate Bill 2399 was passed in United States Congress. This bill designated the home a historic site. The bill was passed by President John F. Kennedy on September 5, 1962. Later that year, Gragg gave as a gift a portrait of Abraham Lincoln that had been in Frederick Douglass's library to the White House. The portrait hung in the Lincoln Room. This was the first time in United States history that a black organization gave a gift to the White House. Also in 1962, the club opened multiple women's health clinics in Washington, D.C. In 1964, she was unanimously elected president emeritus of the National Association of Colored Women. Also in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her to the National Citizens Committee for Community Relations, and the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services. Over her career, Gragg served on or was affiliated with many other positions, including: the Advisory Council of the International Movement of the Atlantic Union, the Gandhi Society for Human Rights, and as the secretary on the National Women's Committee on Civil Rights. She also served in numerous positions on matters related to the city of Detroit, including the Women's Committee for the 250th Anniversary of Detroit.

Ltd, commonly known as Honda Australia, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Honda based in Tullamarine, Victoria, Australia. The Honda brand arrived in Australia in the mid 1950s, when independent firms imported Honda motorcycles. By the 1960s, motorcycles were joined by Honda vehicles, notably the tiny Honda S600 sports car and Honda N360 and later the Accord and Civic. In the late 1960s, Honda Motor Co. decided on a national approach to motor vehicle sales. On February 4, 1969, Japanese Manager Hidehiko Shiomi set up Honda Australia Pty Ltd. It was the first Honda subsidiary in the world set up primarily to sell cars. By 1987, all of the private distributors of Honda motorcycles and power equipment had relinquished distribution rights and Honda Australia became sole importer of all Honda products. In 1991, motorcycles and power equipment were relocated to Campbellfield to become Honda MPE, while Honda Motor Vehicles remained at Tullamarine. In recent years Honda Australia has supported motorsport teams such as Wall Racing in TCR Australia. It also supported Jenson Button in his FWD lap record attempt at Mount Panorama.

Lyman (January 10, 1880 ‚Äì November 12, 1973) was an American writer and pioneer. He and his family were the first settlers of what is now Blanding, Utah. Early life Albert Robison Lyman was born on January 10, 1880 in Fillmore, Utah to Platte D. Lyman and Adelia Robinson. At the time of Albert Lyman's birth, his father was working on the road through Hole-in-the- Rock. Lyman grew up in Scipio and Bluff. Lyman was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 2, 1888. Early in life, viewing the cruelty of the world, he was an atheist. He was converted after an experience with prayer at the Colorado River that led him to \\"know there is a God...in a way I can not deny.\\" In 1898 he went on a mission to Great Britain (he had been called to the Southern States Mission, but the call was changed to the British Isles upon his arrival in Salt Lake City that he might serve under his father who was the president of the European mission at the time.) for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While there, he visited many libraries which led him to his passion for literature and education. Lyman returned home after a year and a half on November 13, 1900 due to poor health. Upon his return, he married Mary Ellen Perkins. In 1905, they would be the first settlers of White Mesa (now Blanding). They lived in a tent during the summer as they prepared to pioneer the area. Lyman ran a farm and a small mercantile business in Blanding. Career Lyman became the County Superintendent of Schools for San Juan County, a school in a tent, in 1908. He would continue to teach school and seminary for 27 years.A letter by Albert R. Lyman quoted in: He founded a school for Native American children in 1946. It was originally kept out of city limits by the citizens, but later years of difficulty in maintaining the school, it was allowed to be brought into Blanding. On the first day of school, the Lymans taught and fed 28 Navajo and Paiute children. During the school's first year, support was shown by the LDS Church with a visit from President George Albert Smith and apostles Matthew Cowley and Spencer W. Kimball. Lyman kept extensive diaries and journals (thoughts and impressions entitled Thots numbered 70 volumes, with 41 volumes of diaries ). He wrote a weekly column for the San Juan Record titled \\"The Old Settler.\\" In order to make time for writing, Lyman built \\"a small one-room native sandstone structure\\" on his property for the purpose. While writing, he raised a flag to warn his children away. His studio, the \\"Swallow‚Äôs Nest,\\" is now part of the Blanding Visitor‚Äôs Center. Lyman died on November 12, 1973 after moving to Provo, Utah to live with his daughter, and was buried in the Blanding cemetery. Religious leadership In addition to the mission of his youth, Lyman also served a mission with his wife to the Navajo-Zuni Mission in 1944-1945. Upon settling Blanding, Utah, he was the Stake Superintendent of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association for San Juan, which required him to travel throughout southeastern Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. He also served as first and second counselor in a stake presidency and as a patriarch. Personal life Albert Lyman married Mary Ellen \\"Lell\\" Perkins on June 26, 1902 in Salt Lake City. They had been writing each other letters while he was serving his mission. They moved to Blanding with their first child Casse. All but the first of their fifteen children would be born in the Blanding area. In 1935, his wife became ill and moved to Salt Lake City to receive better medical treatment. Lyman and the rest of his family moved to Salt Lake City in 1938 to spend time with her before she died on May 13, 1939. His wife told him to marry her previously widowed sister Gladys. He married Gladys on June 14, 1939. Legacy Albert Lyman and his family were the first settlers of Blanding, Utah and he helped develop the school system in San Juan County, as well as built schools for Native Americans in Blanding. Lyman wrote fictional stories and histories of San Juan County and Blanding as well as an autobiography. His many personal journals and diaries serve to illustrate life in southeastern Utah during the 1900s. The Albert R.

Description  This shrub can grow to 60 cm tall, with flat leaves that alternate up its stem. Leaves of the desert lantern can grow to 1.5 ‚Äì 6 cm long and are narrow to circular, hairy and toothed. The flowers are yellow, with 5 petals, borne singly on stalks originating at the bases of the leaves, often appearing clustered at the ends of the stems. The desert lantern differs from dwarf lantern flower (Abutilon fraseri) and plains lantern-bush (Abutilon halophilum) in that the petals are about the same length as the calyx, and from velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) in that the tops of the fruitlets in the fruiting body have very short points. Cultivation and uses Growing wild in a range of climates from warm temperate to the tropical zone, it is found particularly in semi-arid areas of the tropics and subtropics. Plants in this genus generally require a position in full sun or part day shade, and a fertile well-drained soil. The desert lantern can be in flower for much of the year. A fibre was obtained from the stem bark by the Aborigines, but it is unknown if the plant is still utilized today. Habitat Semi-arid districts; on red sandy soils, sand rises and dunes.

His nickname is Professor Filip Filippovich Preobrazhensky () or the \\"Professor of the Transfiguration,\\" who was the central character that transforms from a stray dog into a New Soviet man in Mikhail Bulgakov‚Äôs Heart of a Dog.Dawisha p. 298 Education Shamalov is a dentist/physician by training. He is fluent in German. Career Until the 1990s, Shamalov worked as a dentist in Leningrad (Saint Petersburg). In 1994, he founded the company Masterdentservis () in Leningrad. Shamalov was a representative of Siemens in St. Petersburg from 1992 to 2008 selling medical equipment for Siemens Medical Systems. According to Sergei Kolesnikov, Shamalov refused to answer questions by Siemens internal investigators about money laundering, corruption, and bribery. This led to Shamalov's dismissal from Siemens. From 1993 to 1995, he worked in the Committee on External Relations of the St. Petersburg Mayor's Office. Vladimir Putin was his boss.Dawisha p. 48, 89 In January 1992, AOZT/ZAO Petromed was founded with 51% of its shares owned by the Saint Petersburg's Committee on External Relations (KVS) which Putin headed, 39% of its shares owned by the Center for International Cooperation which is headed by Dmitri Gorelov, and 10% of its shares owned by the Saint Petersburg Committee on Health.Dawisha p. 89 Andrey Kolesnikov, a biophysicist from the Polytechnic Institute, formed a cooperative to manufacture medical equipment for Petromed. In 1993, Shamalov was hired by Putin as the Petromed's purchasing agent for Siemens medical equipment from Germany instead of buying from Kolesnikov's cooperative's Russian manufactured equipment. Over many years, Petromed received state funds for the purchase of medical equipment, but Putin also demanded that Russian oligarchs make charitable contributions to Petromed for the purchase of medical equipment. However, Shamalov greatly inflated the purchase price of the medical equipment and then funneled 33% of the money to offshore accounts. After Vladimir Yakovlev, who was the Governor of Saint Petersburg, became a very outspoken critic of Petromed, Putin, and corruption, Gorelev and Kolesnikov bought out the Saint Petersburg Committee on Health portion of Petromed and became the only two owners of Petromed.Dawisha p. 90 Later, Gorelov, Kolesnikov, and Shamalov used the funneled money, which they obtained as overcharges to Petromed, to purchase shares in Rossiya Bank, Vyborg Shipyard, and other entities. On 10 November 1996, he was a founding member of Vladimir Putin's closed gate community, the cooperative Ozero.Dawisha p. 97, 98, 165, 338 Alt URL As of 2016, Shamalov has remained a member of the cooperative Ozero. In 2004, he, Yuri Kovalchuk, and Dmitry Vladimirovich Gorelov became co-owners of Bank Rossiya. Shamalov has the second largest stake in Bank Rossiya. On 18 October 2005, he, Sergei Kolesnikov, and Gorelov founded Rosinvest. Using money that Shamalov had funneled from Petromed to offshore accounts and money that was from the Russian state treasury, this company built the health resort in Gelendzhik known as \\"Putin's Palace\\" which was part of \\"project south\\" (). To finance \\"Putin's Palace\\", Shamalov's expertise in selling medical equipment through Siemens in St Petersburg was essential in obtaining several hundreds of millions of dollars out of the $1 billion intended for Russian healthcare improvements. Shamalov is the original legal owner of \\"Putin's Palace.\\" In 2006, he became a co-owner with a controlling share (10%) of Vyborg Shipyard. Dmitri Gorelov's son Vasili Gorelov is another owner of Vyborg Shipyard. In 2010, he, his son Kirill, and Oleg Vitalyevich Sharykin () became co-owners of the Russian Cement Company (). Nikolai owns a 12.5% share. Kirill owns a 5% share and is on the board of directors. The Shamalov's combined stake is estimated to be 15 billion rubles in 2018. In 2011, to support the Russian Defense Ministry, Roscosmos, and ROSATOM, he and Oleg Sharykin formed the joint company Ceramic Technologies () which has two main projects: (1) the creation of silicon carbide pencil boxes for the long-term storage and disposal of highly radioactive nuclear waste in underground sites and (2) the development and production of silicon carbide optical blocks in telescopes and sensors used in remote sensing surveillance satellites, which also can detect asteroid hazards and explore deep space. Ceramic Technologies is a member of the Lebedev Institute of Physics (FIAN) through the Troitsk Technopark () and the Skolkovo Foundation but receives no investment and no funding from either. Also, Sharykin said that we have in Kemerovo \\"Khimprom\\" () and PO \\"Tokem\\" (), which competes with Lanxess, Dow Chemical, and Mitsubishi Chemical for monodisperse copolymers in resin ion exchangers for nuclear reactors at nuclear power plants, nuclear powered ships (both icebreakers and submarines), and water treatment in the chemical and metallurgical industries.

It has been recognized as a public health concern. Culture in the United States has led towards the trivialization of violence towards women, with media in the United States possibly contributing to making women-directed violence appear unimportant to the public.  History  The history of laws and cultural taboos have a current effect on how new sexual assault laws are drafted, how the laws are applied by law enforcement and how police decide whether to arrest a suspected perpetrator. The history of sexual assault prosecutions influences whether or not current cases are taken to court. Judges and juries make decisions to convict based upon their past knowledge on the topic of sexual assault.  Media  The imagery of women being sexually victimized in advertisements, pornography, films and music videos has been shown to increase support for violence toward women. In a study published in 2008, it was found that in nearly 2,000 print advertisements of 58 magazines popular in the United States, 50% of ads depicted women as sex objects, appearing as a victim in about 10% of advertisements. The main magazines featuring sexual objectification of women were of the fashion and adolescent topics. These advertisements often portrayed women in various positions and expressions that were derived from pornography. The study also stated that women in the United States feel that rape is \\"trivialized in American culture\\" and concluded that \\"media imagery that presents women as both sex object and as victims\\" has possibly contributed to this trivialization. A 2016 study regarding the objectification of women in the media found that men's magazines, reality television and pornography brought upon more thoughts of objectification, which in turn led to more support of violence toward women. In the study's results, it is stated \\"the relationship between objectifying media exposure and attitudes supportive of violence against women was fully mediated by notions of women as sex objects\\".  Effects of Violence Against Women  Violence against women can lead to immediate physical injuries and longer-term mental and physical health conditions. In addition to negatively impacting mental and physical health, violence against women can interfere with life at work, home, and school. In some cases, violence results in death. Children exposed to violence are also at risk for developing mental and physical health problems. Depending on their age, children may react differently to exposure. Types of violence = Domestic violence = According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of Justice, about 1 in every 4 women suffer from at least one physical assault experience from a partner during adulthood.The Violence Against Women Act of 2005, Summary of Provisions. National Network to End Domestic Violence. Retrieved 2011-11-20. A 2007 report found that in about 64% of female homicides were perpetrated by a partner or family member. Intimate partner abuse may also include other types behavior considered abusive. These are instances in which one partner seeks to control finances, force isolation from friends and family and dominate the relationship. Women who have been identified as being at a higher risk for domestic and sexual abuse are older women, those living in rural communities, disabled women and immigrants. Addressing and preventing such violence may be difficult because some women do not have nearby access to victim services. A women may also have language barriers, economic and psychological dependence on the perpetrator. In some instances of violence, a woman and her children may not be able to procure housing apart from the perpetrator. Between 22-57% and of these women become homeless. Due to housing regulations that practice a 'no tolerance' policy requiring eviction of all household members when even one person is convicted of any crime, battered women can then be homeless as a result. This practice essentially creates a disincentive for reporting violence in the home. Some women who have experienced violence in the home risk the loss of their jobs related to their need for medical treatment, counselling, finding new housing and legal protection. = Rape = The percentage of women who have been raped in the United States is between 15% and 20%, with various studies disagreeing with each other. (National Violence Against Women survey in 1995, 17.6% rate;Prevalence, Incidence, and Consequences of Violence Against Women: Findings From the National Violence Against Women Survey. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-10-01. a 2007 Department of Justice study on rape found 18% rate). About 500 women were raped per day in the United States in 2008. About 21.8% of rapes of female victims in the United States are gang rapes.Horvath, Miranda et al. Handbook on the Study of Multiple Perpetrator Rape. Routledge 2013, page 15. A March 2013 report from the United States Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics, from 1995 to 2010, the estimated annual rate of female rape or sexual assault had declined by 58%, from 5.0 victimizations per 1,000 females age 12 or older to 2.1 per 1,000. JournalistsResource.org, retrieved March 24, 2012 However, a study in 2013 regarding rape in the United States found that cases remain underreported.National Research Council. Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2013. Law enforcement in the United States also manipulates rape statistics to \\"create the illusion of success in fighting violent crime\\" according to a 2014 study.Yung, C. R. (2014). How to Lie with Rape Statistics: America's Hidden Rape Crisis. Iowa Law Review, 99(1197). When investigated, defendants are rarely convicted. = Sexual assault = Annual rape and all forms of sexual assaults per 100,000 people Sexual assault differs significantly from other crimes of assault. For sexual assault, the severity of the crime has been determined by establishing the victim's moral character, behavior, signs of resistance and verbal expressions of non- consensual participation. The crime of battery, another type of assault, is determined by the perpetrators actions and intent. The victim's response to this type of assault does not determine whether a crime has taken place or not. The victim does not have to demonstrate that they resisted, gave consent or have a history of being punched. In addition, the question of assault occurring after consent is given complicates the understanding of violence and injury - even if sex is consensual. Changes in the laws regarding some sexual acts may \\"lead to the glorification of sexual violence\\".  Objectification  A 2015 study by the University of Nebraska found that college women in the United States who were victims of sexual violence or partner violence began to self-objectificate themselves and felt body shame. = State violence =  Forced pregnancy and sterilization  A map from a 1929 Swedish royal commission report displays the U.S. states that had implemented sterilization legislation Forced sterilization is recognized as a type of gender-based violence. In the United States, Native American, Mexican American, African American and Puerto Rican-American women were coerced into sterilization programs, with Native Americans and African Americans especially being targeted. Many of these projects were a result of racism and eugenics in the United States. In total, 31 of 50 states had official eugenics programs with tens of thousands of women being sterilized. Since the days of European colonization, Europeans who arrived sought to control Native American populations in order to acquire more capital and resources from the newly discovered land. This resulted in policies of genocide and removal targeting Native American women and girls in order to procure land for settlements. Records have shown that Native American girls as young as eleven years-old had hysterectomy operations performed. Regarding African Americans, the origin of their population control was from the slavery in the United States. During the period of slave trade in the United States, African slaves were used as a mode of production, with slave women being forced into pregnancy to increase the slave labor force. This history of controlling African American populations motivated the future sterilization of African American women. In 1927, Supreme Court of the United States endorsed eugenics programs in the country. The ruling pushed the eugenics movement further and resulted in more forced sterilizations of women. Involuntary euthanasia was also supported by American eugenists and practiced in rare instances, with the most promoted method of euthanasia being gas chambers, though it never gained footing in the United States and sterilization became preference. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes penned: Eugenics and sterilization programs in the United States would later inspire Nazi eugenics. The American private foundation Rockefeller Foundation assisted with the development and funding of numerous eugenics projects in Germany, including a program directed by Josef Mengele who would later perform human experimentation at Auschwitz. During the Nuremberg trials, Nazis used Holmes' above quote to defend themselves.  Demographics  = Native Americans = Native American and Alaska Native women experience high rates of violence. These acts of violence include sexual assault, domestic violence, and sex trafficking. The US Department of Justice found that 84% of Native American and Alaskan Native women have suffered some form of violence. Of these, 56% have experienced sexual violence. Out of these, more than 90% were assaulted by a non-tribal member. These women report not being safe, and being pushed, shoved, or beaten. Many describe 'psychological aggression' and control. These counts may be underestimated. Native tribal courts are not able to prosecute non-tribal members for sexual assault and rape. Non-Native American men are responsible for most of the assaults against Native American women. Psychological aggression has been experienced by 66.4% by their partner. In the US, greater than 1.5 million American Indian and Alaska Native women have suffered violence during their life. Over 39% of American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in the past year. Of these, 14% percent were sexually abused, 9% were assaulted by their intimate partner, 12% were stalked and 25% experienced psychological aggression by their intimate partner. In the past year, over 730,000 American Indian and Alaska Native women experienced violence. Native American women and Alaska Native women, along with black women, have high murder rates when compared with other ethnicities. Women between ages 18 and 29 comprise 36.3% of Native American women and Alaska Native women murder victims. Intimate partner violence accounts for 47% of those murdered. Current intimate partners commit 81% of the murders and 12% are committed by a past intimate partner. Jealousy, arguments and preceding violent acts occur before the murder 66% of the time. Human trafficking of Native American Women and Alaska Native women is thought to also occur, but studies and statistics are lacking. When compared to other ethnicities, Native American women experience sexual assault and rape rates that are 2.5 higher. Though the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized in 2013, most tribes struggle to fund jails, courts, jails, law enforcement, judges, and prevention programs. Statistics are lacking for violence against Native American women who reside on reservations. Data is unknown because no agency collects such information. = Immigrants = Immigrants to the US have great difficulties when they try to leave violent relationships. If a perpetrator controls the immigration status, they can then use the threat of deportation to prevent the battered woman from contacting authorities and assistance agencies. Some legislation passed by the US Congress allowed immigrant victims to leave situations of domestic violence. Other proposed policies not yet in effect are designed to stop deportation of immigrants who have experienced domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking.  Law  = Violence Against Women Act = Vice President Joe Biden, who originally drafted VAWA, speaking about the Act On September 13, 1994, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which was drafted by Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) and co-written by Democrat Louise Slaughter. The Act granted $1.6 billion of funding for investigating and prosecuting violent crimes directed towards women, making compensation from those convicted automatic and mandatory. VAWA was accepted by Congress with bipartisan support, though House Republicans attempted to cut down on funding in 1995. VAWA created the Office on Violence Against Women, part of the Department of Justice. In 2005, the American Civil Liberties Union expressed that \\"VAWA is one of the most effective pieces of legislation enacted to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It has dramatically improved the law enforcement response to violence against women and has provided critical services necessary to support women in their struggle to overcome abusive situations\\". Since early 2019, the VAWA has not been extended due to political disputes within the United States Congress.  Reactions  In 2011, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, Rashida Manjoo, reported progress in regards to violence towards women in the United States, though she also made recommendations regarding African and Native Americans, immigrants, military personnel and those who are imprisoned.

The community is located in the northeast of Wangyue Subdistrict and the east of Yuelu District, it is a pure residence with 4 blocks of residential area named Bafang Residential Area () surrounded by four roads. The residential area of Bafang was named after Bafang Mountain (), it was invested and developed by Changsha Jingfa Real Estate () under Chanfine Group (). The community is bounded by Jinxing Road to the west, Chazishan Road to the north, Yuehua Road to the east and Dujuan Road to the south, it covers an area of about 0.8 square kilometer with households of 11,017.Bafang community profile of Wangyue Subdistrict / ÊúõÂ≤≥Ë°óÈÅìÂÖ´ÊñπÁ§æÂå∫ see yuelu.gov (2017-11-26) History In 2001, the Government Buildings of Changsha was transferred to Yuelu Anvenue in Yuelu District from Panzheng Street in Furong District, the core area in the east of Xiang River. In order to promote the development in the west of Xiang, ease the traffic pressure in the city proper and facilitate work and life of civil servants, after researching and reporting to Hunan Province Commission for Discipline Inspection, a decision was made to support the construction of commercial housing residence for civil servants. The residential site is located at the junction of Wangyue and Guanshaling subdistricts in Yuelu District. The total land area is 97.73 hectares (1,466 mu). The project is implemented in two phases. The first phase includes 2 blocks of A and D. The project started in 2002 and the main building was completed in 2005. its main facilities include a kindergarten, a primary school and a middle school. The second phase of the project are 2 blocks of B and C. The project started in 2015 and the building was completed in 2017.163.com (2014-04-16) or hn.rednet First phase of project The project of first phase includes Block A and D of Bafang Residential Area, which are characterised by low-rise five - storey buildings. Including Heyuan Park located in the southeast of Block D, there are 2,543 households in Bafang Residential Block A and D. When the project was completed in 2005, there were hardly any roads, public transportation and commercial facilities around. Plus, the price of the first-period house was much higher than the price of the surrounding real estate. For example, the Residential Area of Xianjia Xincun () is less than one kilometer away from the south of Bafang, its location is closer to the central urban area, and the supporting infrastructure around the community was very complete at that time. The opening price of its real estate is only 900-1,000 yuan (109-121 US dollars) per square meter in 2002. In the same period, the real estate of Bafang opened at 1,380 yuan (167 US dollars) per square meter. At the time of delivery, the developer violated the contract by raising the price by 180 yuan (22 US dollars) per square meter. At last, the number of civil servants actually purchasing the house was lower than expected. In the first five years, the occupancy rate after purchase had been very low. Around 2006, the surrounding roads, public transportation, kindergarten and other supporting facilities were gradually normalized. Especially after the opening of primary school in 2006, the occupancy rate of homes had gradually increased, but at most less than one-third. In general, the occupancy rate did not become normal and exceeded 70% until the start of the second phase of construction in 2014. =Heyuan Park= The Heyuan Park () is a non-civil servants residential area, it is a part of Block D.

The is an annual Japanese festival in which babies are held in the arms of sumo wrestlers in an open-air sumo ring. Two babies compete in a short match in which the first child to cry is proclaimed the winner. According to Japanese folklore, a crying baby has the power to ward off evil spirits, while a strong, loud cry indicates the child will grow up strong and healthy.  History  The Naki Sumo Festival has been held throughout Japan for over 400 years. The festival is considered to have origins in the folk belief that the loud cry of an innocent baby has the power to ward off demons or evil spirits. The Japanese proverb naku ko wa sodatsu, meaning \\"crying babies grow fastest\\", is an additional source of inspiration for the festival.  Current practice  The winning child is raised high in the air by a sumo wrestler at the Sensoji Temple in Asakusa, Tokyo. The Naki Sumo Festival is held annually at Shinto shrines throughout Japan, most commonly on or around May 5 to coincide with Children's Day at the end of the Golden Week holiday. The specific customs and traditions of each festival vary by location, however the main focus of every festival is a ritualistic prayer for the good health of each baby and a competition between infants held in a sumo wrestling ring. A Shinto priest opens each festival with rituals to pray for the healthy growth of each baby. The staff at the shrine hand-make four-pronged kabuto helmets for each participant to wear during the crying competition and create commemorative gifts and souvenirs for the parents. Next, the crying baby competition is held outdoors in a handmade sumo ring. Two babies at a time compete in short matches, while held in the arms of professional or student sumo wrestlers. The first child to cry is declared the winner and bestowed with a blessing of good health. If both children cry simultaneously, the baby with the louder or longer cry is typically the victor. Sumo wrestlers employ a variety of techniques to encourage crying, including bouncing the baby in their arms, making loud noises and funny or scary facial expressions, and chanting \\"Naki! Naki! Naki!\\" (\\"Cry! Cry! Cry!\\" in English). In some versions of the festival, when neither baby has cried for a number of minutes, referees or judges donning traditional Japanese masks approach the babies and attempt to scare them. At the end of each match, some families and spectators yell out the phrase banzai raku meaning \\"live long\\". The best-known Naki Sumo Festival is held each year in Asakusa, Tokyo, where student sumo wrestlers of the Sens≈ç-ji temple hold the babies in their arms. When the babies begin to cry, the student sumos raise the babies higher in the air, which is believed to strengthen the blessing endowed on each crying child. At the Gokoku Shrine in Hiroshima, babies are dressed in kimono and seated facing one another on pillows while a sumo referee encourages the babies to cry. Eligible competitors must be between the ages of 6 months and 18 months at the time of the festival. Around 100 babies compete each year. The festival is free and open to the public; however, some shrines and temples require that parents submit an application or pay a fee to participate. Some locations are so popular that children are chosen by lottery, and parents will travel across Japan to find a place to participate. While the majority of participants are Japanese, some foreigners have traveled to Japan to partake in the festival. CNN interviewed a Japanese-American couple who flew from New York to attend the festival in Asakusa in 2010. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, many Naki Sumo Festivals scheduled for spring 2020 have been cancelled or postponed until fall.

For every 1 foot of freshwater depression, sea-salty waters rises 40 feet as the cone of depression forms. Salinization of groundwater is one of the main water pollution ever produced by mankind or from natural processes. It degrades water quality to the point it passes acceptable drink water and irrigation standards. To this day, the State of California enforced several methodologies through technical innovation and scientific approach to combat saltwater intrusion in areas vulnerable to saltwater intrusion.  Los Angeles County  Groundwater basin in Los Angeles County, California is considered as a vital resource both for agricultures and residential areas. For more than 40 years, Los Angeles County have managed to protect local groundwater basins from seawater intrusion. By injecting freshwater along coastal regions, Los Angeles County tends to create hydraulic gradients between freshwater and saltwater. This prevents saltwater to advance further inland. One critical factor affecting water supply in Los Angeles is population growth. As population growth increases in Los Angeles County, saltwater intrusion tends to advance further inland into Los Angeles groundwater aquifers. This occurs due to population growth, demanding an excess amount of freshwater from groundwater pumping wells. This sets an hydrologic condition for saltwater to follow the geomorphic pressure gradient produced landward. A cone of depression develops as a result through pumping wells operation to supply water for residential areas and agriculture. To combat saltwater intrusion, Los Angeles water districts decides to construct injection wells to form an hydraulic barrier, preventing advancement of saltwater intrusion in Los Angeles aquifers. Geologists, however, continue to study and survey Los Angeles County coastline because creating this hydraulic gradients is not fully efficient. To better understand saltwater intrusion in Los Angeles County, the U.S Geological Survey partners with Water Replenishment District of Southern California and Los Angeles County Department of Public Works to conduct a geological survey through using reflection seismology. This means that seismic profiles is essential to understand how sedimentation influence saltwater intrusion. = Managing Seawater Intrusion in LA County = The Alamitos Barrier Project is one of the three hydraulic barriers in Los Angeles County. It was created mainly to protect groundwater supplies from seawater intrusion. It is currently operated under Los Angeles County Flood Control District and the Orange County Water District. Other joint committees include the Water Replenishment District of Southern California who is responsible for supplying water to each hydraulic barrier and then the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works who operates the projects on a daily basis. The effects of seawater intrusion took first noticed in 1956. As a response, a coastal barrier project was later built by the Orange County Water District to combat saltwater intrusion which remains prominent and troublesome to this day. Known as Water Factory 21, the District built in seven extraction wells located 2 miles away from the coast to intercept and send saltwater back into the sea. A series of 23 injection wells were also built further inland to create a powerful hydraulic barrier between saltwater and freshwater. The water supplies of Water Factory 21 undergo several phases before it reaches the injection wells. This man-made hydraulic processes includes air stripping, recarbonation, multi-media filtration, carbon sequestration and chlorination. 23,000 acres feet of water is produced each year to supply this amount of water into each injection wells to form effective yet inefficient hydraulic barrier. After each water droplet goes through each treatment, the injections wells distributes this vast amount of freshwater into the ocean and into the groundwater basin. Majority of this freshwater is flowed into the groundwater basin to meet consumers demands.https://www.ocwd.com/media/2451/water- factory-21-brochure.pdf = Monitoring Seawater Intrusion = Understanding the extent and rate of saltwater intrusion are key elements for sustainable water management. Ineffective management means low water quality for urban sectors and agriculture. Effective management strategies include monitoring seawater intrusion in areas prone to saltwater intrusion. Common approach for monitoring seawater intrusion include measuring groundwater level, hydrograph analysis, water quality sampling and geophysical logging. These procedures provide discrete and tangible information for early-warning signs regarding saltwater intrusion adjacent to lands and groundwater aquifers. Airborne electromagnetic measurement is used by helicopters to map out electrical resistivity. This method can provide useful information concerning water quality over 100 miles in a day by penetrating through sea surfaces to a depth of 1,500 feet. Using airborne geophysical measurement yields useful data for interpretation and hydrological information.  Sacramento San-Joaquin Delta  Both the levee system and the delta islands help protects freshwater hydrology and exporting water facilities from saltwater intrusion. This can be accomplished by displacing freshwater outflow and sustaining freshwater gradient within the delta itself. This means that there is an artificial balance between saltwater flowing inland and freshwater flowing seaward. Failure of a levee system would introduce more saltwater into the Delta. This as a result would tip the balance of water-exchanging gradient in favor of saltwater advancement. Several aqueducts and the water supply system would have undesirable affects as saltwater continue to flow inland, overpowering freshwater outflow. Agricultural and domestic use, for example, may experience freshwater deficiency due to overall salinity within the Delta. This explains why the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta becomes the heart of California's water supply system. However, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta presents major vulnerabilities from both ends because sea level not only rises but freshwater outflow tends to decrease as well due to increased upstream water usage and the effects of climate change. As freshwater outflow decreases in quantity, saltwater moves into the Delta affecting water management programs and climate variability. Temporally, saltwater intrusion less likely occurs in winter and spring season, where most flooding occurs. This occurs due to heavy runoff from the mountains, fending off seawater intrusion. Before human innovation and management strategies, seawater immensely flood the Delta marshes. This means economic downturn because Delta water can be costly in terms of treating the water itself. Above all, saltwater management strategies is crucial for water districts and other water agencies to intercept saltwater intrusion effectively. This also means that the overall health of the Delta's levee system and islands is vital to protect and promote standard water quality both for farmers and urban areas. But such movement of saltwater and freshwater is difficult to manage as one big giant washing machine especially whenever a levee breaks or a lower-than-sea level delta island is then completely submerged. = Agricultural Drainage in the Delta = In the southernmost part of the Delta, the concentration of saltwater content increases as farmers irrigate their crops for fresh produce. The agricultural drainage water is where salinization intensified through the process of irrigation. In some occasion, there may be no delta water that is left to flush out and push back saltwater content within the delta, specifically in the south Delta. This creates a localize salinity problems for water managers to address or mitigate since salinity is highly concentrated. = Suisun Marsh = The Suisun Marsh is one of the largest brackish water wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This aquatic habitat is where freshwater and saltwater meets. Here lies 230 miles of levees protecting the Suisun Marsh. The Delta salinity greatly influenced the overall health of the Suisun Marsh. This include the ecosystem in this area, encompassing living plants and neighboring species. The State Water Project's Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates manages tidal flows to limit saltwater intrusion from salty tidal flows. The California's Department of Water Resources built this tidal-flow control gate to limit high saline first introduced from Grizzly Bay and through the Montezuma Slough.

She sang both soprano and mezzo-soprano roles, and often sang with her younger sister Anna. Life and career Mombelli was born in Naples, the eldest of Domenico Mombelli and Vincenza Vigan√≤-Mombelli's twelve children. She was trained in singing by her father who had been a prominent tenor in the 1780s and 90s. She began performing in Lisbon at a very young age when her father was engaged by the Teatro de S√£o Carlos. There she appeared in the oratorio La morte di Saule by (1804) and the operas Nardone e Nannetta by (1806) and Ifigenia in Aulide by (1809). From 1805 the Mombelli family was based in Bologna, although they travelled to Lisbon and various theatres in Italy with their own opera troupe which included Domenico, Ester, and Ester's younger sister Anna. In Bologna the Mombelli's befriended the young Rossini who was still a student at the Accademia Filarmonica. Domenico commissioned Rossini to compose the opera Demetrio e Polibio for which Vincenza had written the libretto. It was to be Rossini's first opera, although not the first to be publicly staged. It was performed privately in Bologna in 1809 and officially premiered in Rome's Teatro Valle on 18 May 1812. On both of those occasions three of its four roles were sung by Domenico, Ester, and Anna. Mombelli's troupe subsequently took the work to several cities in Italy. Ester went on to become a distinguished interpreter of Rossini's operas, creating the role of Madame Cortese in his Il viaggio a Reims and singing the title role in La Cenerentola on multiple occasions. Rossini also composed the cantata La morte di Didone expressly for her voice. She sang in its premiere performance at the Teatro San Benedetto in Venice on 2 May 1818. From 1823 to 1825 she appeared at the Th√©√¢tre Italien in Paris, where she not only sang in the premiere of Il viaggio a Reims but also sang the title role in La donna del lago in first Paris performances. In December 1825, Mombelli returned to Venice where she sang at La Fenice until February 1826. She appeared as Desdemona in the theatre's first performance of Rossini's Otello and sang in the world premieres of Carafa's Il paria and Mercadante's Erode and Caritea. In 1827 she married Count Camillo Gritti and retired from the stage. Gritti had been the administrator of La Fenice from 1818 to 1825 and in the ensuing years remained an influential figure in the artistic life of Venice.

The dam is positioned 0.8 miles upstream from the confluence of Lost Man Creek with Prairie Creek, and is 24 feet in length with a width of 75 feet. The dam extends back southwards 100 feet. History In 1936, a dam was built in the upper limits of the Lost Man Creek; the dam was named Upper Dam on Lost Man Creek. This dam was solely built to provide water to the nearby hatchery, the Prairie Creek Fish Hatchery. The Prairie Creek Fish Hatchery was built in 1927 at the junction of Prairie Creek and Lost Man Creek to stimulate the growth of cutthroat, chinook, and silverside fish. A 12 inch wide pipeline travels 3,000 feet to connect the hatchery and the Upper Dam. 19 years later the Upper Dam was abandoned and left there. This dam created a barrier for the chinook salmon's migration. The reason for this being that fish need a good flow stream and a dip in the water to gain momentum and hurdle over to the top of the stream; the stream flow that the upper dam provided was very light and there was no dip to help them gain momentum; eventually all the fish got stuck at the bottom of the dam. In 1989, the Redwood National Park decided to remove the dam entirely. Much of the clean up consisted of removing fish ladders, filling the dam with sediment, and filling drying out the pond behind it, which could hold 800 feet of water. Due to flooding from 1971- 1972 much of the pipe line connecting the hatchery and the dam was lost. To take its place the Lower Dam on Lost Man Creek was built. Its only job is to divert water that comes from the Prairie Creek Fish Hatchery. As the upper dam was being removed proposals to remove the lower dam were already in place; but there was fear as to what would happen if it was removed and how quickly. The proposed ideas were to demolish the dam within one season, the second option was to demolish the dam over the course of six seasons. The last two options were taking it apart a slowly remove part of it over one season and leave it as it. These options all had scientific uncertainty most with how the wild life will react and how will sediment inflow effect vegetation. In the end it was left as is. Legal issues National Parks are purposed for keeping and or restoring a habitat to resemble a point in time where humans had very little impact on the environment. Since the Redwood Forest is a national park, there is controversial debate on whether or not to remove the dam. The legal issues fall upon water rights, air rights, and structural design. If the dam were to be removed, permits from the Department of Army, Department of Fish and Game, Stream Bed Alteration agreement permit, and a Regional Water Quality Control Board Waste Charge permit would all be needed. Before any of these can be acquired, the National Park must get permission from the state of California and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for permission to alter an environment.

Gluzman first came to prominence in the 1970s when she successfully pressured the Soviet Union to allow her husband, scientist Yakov Gluzman, to emigrate to the West with the rest of their family. In 1996, she conspired with her cousin, Vladimir Zelinin, to murder Yakov after he filed for divorce. Gluzman became the first woman to be convicted under the United States Violence Against Women Act, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Biography Gluzman was born and raised in Soviet Ukraine. She married Yakov Gluzman in 1969. The Gluzmans had a son, Ilan Gluzman. =Activism= In 1971, Gluzman launched a public campaign to pressure the Soviet government to allow her husband to emigrate with her to Israel. Gluzman's father waited fifteen years for a permit from the government to allow his family to leave, but the permit did not include Gluzman's husband. After five more years, Soviet authorities refused to grant Yakov a permit and told his family that they would leave the Soviet Union without him if they wished to leave at all. Gluzman was pregnant, and thus decided to leave for Israel with hopes that her husband could follow eventually. As Yakov's appeals were continually struck down, Rita temporarily relocated to the United States. Her visa was sponsored by Congressman Jack Kemp. She spoke across the U.S. and reportedly went on an 18-day hunger strike to generate interest in her case. She also met with multiple UN officials, including then-UN Ambassador Rita Hauser. Gluzman spurred interest in her case by providing numerous interviews, and advocated for individuals to petition the then-Russian ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin for her husband's release. She was able to persuade George H.W. Bush, Secretary-General U Thant, and Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to petition for her cause. In October 1971, Gluzman spoke before the American Jewish Welfare Federation Leadership Forum in Atlanta, Georgia, and her story appeared on the front page of the Atlanta Constitution. Atlanta Alderman Wyche Fowler mistakenly thought that she was an Atlanta constituent, and took a clipping of the newspaper story with him to Kiev. A high-ranking official learned about Gluzman's story from Fowler, and brought it to other Communist Party officials. That night, Fowler was told that Yakov would be granted leave to emigrate. On November 25, Gluzman reunited with Yakov in Vienna, Austria. Two days later, the couple reached Israel, where they settled with Rita's parents. The couple then planned to study at Tel Aviv University, where Yakov continued his study of biology and Rita continued her study of chemistry. =Murder of Yakov Gluzman= By 1996, Yakov was an accomplished cancer researcher and co-owned a computer company, ECI Technologies, with Rita. However, that year, Yakov filed for divorce; he claimed that Rita was abusive and spent too much money, while Rita asserted that Yakov was having an extramarital affair with a woman in Israel. Federal agents later asserted that Rita went to Israel to collect photos of Yakov with another woman, then used the photos and illegal phone taps to blackmail him. Police asserted that Rita feared a costly divorce and giving up control of ECI. Yakov was murdered on April 6, 1996 in his home in Rockland County, New York. He was stabbed and struck with an axe, and his body was chopped into pieces with a hacksaw. Rita's cousin, Vladimir Zelenin, was charged with conspiracy to commit murder after police found him preparing to throw ten garbage bags containing Yakov's body parts into the Passaic River. Zelenin was also covered in Yakov's blood. Gluzman went missing for six days after her husband's death, until she was found by police on Long Island and arrested on April 12. She was found breaking into a guest cabin owned by Yakov's former employer. Gluzman's car had a stolen license plate, and a passport and travel books for Switzerland and Australia were found inside. Gluzman, who had been living away from her husband in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, was charged with violating the Violence Against Women Act, which criminalizes crossing state lines while intending to injure or intimidate a spouse or partner. She was the first woman to be charged under this law, and the first individual to be charged for murder under the law. Federal charges were allegedly brought because there was a lack of physical evidence to corroborate the witness account of Zelenin, who turned against Gluzman. During the trial, Zelenin testified that Gluzman helped him immigrate to the U.S. and find a job at her company. Gluzman also told Zelenin that if Yakov was allowed to get a divorce, Zelenin would be out of work because ECI would go out of business. Zelenin alleged Gluzman plotted her husband's murder, and took Zelenin to Home Depot and Grand Union for an axe and garbage bags, for the murder. The two of them attacked Yakov in his apartment and killed him with two axes. Gluzman cleaned the scene, and Zelenin dismembered the body. Gluzman's defense claimed that Zelenin acted alone. On April 30, 1997, Gluzman was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted on a federal charge of interstate domestic violence resulting in death. After her sentencing, Gluzman appealed her sentence, claiming her conviction was unconstitutional. Her appeal was denied. On July 28, 2020, Gluzman was granted a compassionate release after she experienced several medical issues including multiple strokes and a diagnosis of early Parkinson‚Äôs disease. She was released from the Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas and headed to Hackensack, New Jersey, where she planned to reside with her sister. She begun her five year court- ordered supervised release immediately after. According to the conditions for her supervised release, Gluzman will be confined to her home with few exceptions, including doctor appointments, court appearances, religious services, employment, education, or other court-approved activities. Gluzman also will have to wear a GPS monitoring device. While out on probation, she will be cared for by her sister. =Media= Gluzman appeared as the subject of an episode of the television show Snapped and Deadly Women and as an episode of city confidential References Category:Axe murder Category:Living people Category:Ukrainian people imprisoned abroad Category:People convicted of murder by the United States federal government Category:American people convicted of murder Category:Ukrainian people convicted of murder Category:Ukrainian emigrants to the United States Category:American female murderers Category:Ukrainian Jews Category:American Jews Category:1996 murders in the United States Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:1996 in New York (state) Category:Mariticides ","title":"Rita Gluzman"},{"id":"57381535","text":"On 19 June 1985, a bombing at the Frankfurt Airport, West Germany, killed three and wounded 74 people.

Previously, Murcia was a semi-independent vassal of Castile, but it renounced its allegiance during the Mud√©jar revolt of 1264‚Äì1266. Aragon entered the war in Castile's side after Castile's Queen Violant‚Äîwho was James' daughter‚Äîwrote a letter asking for her father's help. After initial negotiations with his nobles, James marched from Valencia at the end of October 1265. Subsequently, Aragonese troops took multiple Murcian towns and defeated a reinforcement column sent by the Emirate of Granada. The siege of the city of Murcia started in January 1266, ending in its surrender on 31 January and James' entrance to the city on 3 February. After the conquest, Murcia was returned to Castile and lost its semi-independent status. Subsequently, its Muslim population was moved to suburbs as Castile brought Christian settlers to populate the region. Background In the first half of the thirteenth century, Castile and Aragon conquered multiple Muslim states in southern Spain. Murcia, a major power centre in the southeast, surrendered on 2 April 1243 to Infante Alfonso, the future Alfonso X of Castile. After this conquest, the Taifa of Murcia became a semi-independent vassal of Castile, ruled by the Baha al-Dawla of Banu Hud. Under this arrangement, Murcia still had its own army, bureaucracy, and coins, but its rulers had to submit as Alfonso's vassals. Baha al-Dawla remained loyal to Alfonso X, despite his policy of supporting Murcia's Christian population. Baha al-Dawla was succeeded by his son, Abu Ja'far in 1259, who died after a few years and replaced by his son Muhammad. Muhammad was soon deposed by his cousin Abu Bakr ibn Hud, also known as Al-Wathiq. By this time, Sultan Muhammad I of the neighboring Emirate of Granada had consolidated his power and territories to become another regional power, even though nominally also under Castile's sovereignty.  Rebellion  In late July or August 1264, the Muslim population (\\"Mud√©jars\\") of Lower Andalusia started a rebellion against Castile, beginning in Jerez and spreading to other towns. The rebellion was partly caused by Castile's oppressive forcible relocation policy against the Muslims, as well as by instigation from Muhammad I of Granada. Muhammad I renounced his allegiance to Castile and attacked as well. Multiple settlements and castles, including Jerez itself, fell to the rebels or Granadan troops. Murcia joined the rebellion as well. The Murcians expelled Castillian troops from its alc√°zar (castle), and al-Wathiq declared allegiance to Muhammad I. Muhammad I sent troops to help Murcia led by his Banu Ashqilula ally, Abdallah ibn Ali. Abdallah might have taken power in Murcia before the Murcians reinstated al-Wathiq at some point during rebellion.  Aragonese offensive  =Preparation= Pope Clement IV authorized James I to collect tithes to fund the war. Initially the task to suppress the revolt passed to Alfonso's brother Manuel and Grand Master Paio Peres Correia of the Order of Santiago. Concerned that Castile was fighting on three fronts, Alfonso X asked his wife, Queen Violant to request help from her father, James I of Aragon. James I agreed and summoned his parliaments to support the war. The Catalan Courts agreed to raise taxes for the campaign in July 1264, but the parliament for his other dominion, Aragonese Corts initially rejected the campaign when they met in November. James I spent the next following months trying to convince the Aragonese lords. In May 1265, the Archbishop of Tarragon and the Bishop of Valencia began preaching for crusades. Pope Clement IV allowed James to collect tithe from his dominions for up to three years to fund the crusade. Infante Peter (future Peter III of Aragon) carried out initial raids against the rebels in late summer of 1265. =Invasion of Murcia= James I marched with his troops from Valencia at the end of October 1265. He kept his army close together and advanced through Muslim-held towns. In turn, the Muslims of Villena, Elda, Petrer, Orihuela surrendered to him, with terms that they were allowed to keep their lands and worship freely. James now prepared to march on the city of Murcia itself and was joined by Castilian troops under Infante Manuel. At the same time Granadan troops, numbering 800 cavalry and 2,000 men- at-arms, marched to relieve the city. James moved to intercept this column and the Granadans were routed in a battle. In early December, James met with Alfonso X in Alcaraz, on the border between Castile and James' Kingdom of Valencia, to coordinate their war efforts. On 2 January 1266 James marched from Orihuela and started the siege of the city of Murcia. Skirmishes broke out between the defenders and the besiegers. Outnumbered and cut off from reinforcements, the city defenders asked for terms. James offered to ask Alfonso to restore the Murcians' legal rights from before the rebellion: self- government under Castilian suzerainty, freedom of worship, and preservation of lands and properties. They agreed to this offer but requested Alfonso's explicit agreement rather than just James' promise to ask him. James refused to get Alfonso's agreement before the city surrendered. Finally the city surrendered on 31 January. James' standards were raised in the city and he was said to have kneeled down and kissed the ground to thank God when he saw this. James himself entered the city on 3 February, formally accepting the city's surrender from al-Wathiq. Aftermath After the conquest of Murcia, James I took over the city's mosque and consecrated it as a church. Today it is the site of the Murcia Cathedral (pictured). After the city's surrender, James and his troops moved in and occupied the city's castle as well as the area between it and the gate facing James' original encampment. The Aragonese took over a mosque next to the castle‚Äîin contravention to the terms of surrender. When the Muslim citizens protested, James said that there were ten other mosques in the city, and that he did not wish to hear the Muslim call to prayer in the castle where he took up residence. He also threatened to sack the town. The Muslims relented; James then transformed the mosque into a church and dedicated it to the Virgin Mary. Afterwards he entered the church, where he cried emotionally and his priests held mass. James and his army stayed in Murcia until March 1266. He returned to his realm, handing over the city to the Castilians. On 23 June, the city formally renewed its allegiance to Castile's king Alfonso X, and requested his pardon for the rebellion. Effectively, Murcia's defeat meant that it was no longer self-governing under Muslim rule, but ruled directly by the Castilians. The rights of the Muslims guaranteed by the terms of surrender turned out to be weakly enforced. In the city, Muslims were only allowed to live in a suburb called Arrixaca, and other Muslim citizens were compelled to move there. A wall was constructed between the Muslim suburb and the rest of the city, and the Muslims were given freedom of religion in their suburb. Al- Wathiq was given lands and lived there in exile, in his place Abdallah ibn Hud was appointed as the leader of the Muslims, with the title \\"King of the Moors of Arrixaca in Murcia\\", rather than \\"King of Murcia\\" before the rebellion. The rest of the city were confiscated and assigned to Christians: settlers were brought from other parts of Castile to populate it. Castile implemented similar efforts in other towns in the area. Alfonso stayed in Murcia between February 1271 and fall 1272, supervising the colonization of the region and establishing a new administration by Christians. He granted the fuero to Murcia and a number of other towns.

It was the first of a large number of similar species to be described and is therefore the type species. It has a single grass-like leaf and up to five white flowers Description Thelymitra longifolia is a tuberous, perennial herb with a single ribbed, linear to lance-shaped leaf long and wide. Up to five or more white or very pale pink flowers, reddish green on the back, wide are borne on a flowering stem sometimes up to tall. The three sepals and three petals (including the labellum) are alike except that the dorsal sepal in slightly wider. The column is white or brown near its base but dark brown to black near its tip. The lobe on the top of the anther is usually rounded and yellow and the side lobes have dense, tangled white hairs. Flowering occurs from September to February. Taxonomy and naming Thelymitra longifolia was first formally described in 1776 by Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Georg from a plant collected during James Cooks second voyage to the Pacific and the description was published in Characteres Generum Plantarum. The specific epithet (longifolia) is derived from the Latin words longus meaning \\"long\\" and folia meaning \\"leaves\\". Distribution and habitat The white sun orchid usually grows in sunny places in open areas amongst scrub, but sometimes in dense forest. It is found on the North, South, Stewart, Three Kings, Chatham and Auckland Islands. It has also been reported from Norfolk Island but there is doubt that those collections match the type specimen.

Biography =Tennis career= Pasquale played in three Federation Cup ties for Switzerland. She debuted in Switzerland's quarterfinal loss to the USSR in the 1979 Federation Cup and lost her singles match to Natasha Chmyreva in three sets. In the 1980 competition, she featured in a 3‚Äì0 whitewash over Greece in the first round, then sat out of the action as Switzerland made it to the semifinals. She was recalled for the opening rubber of the semifinal against the United States, replacing Isabelle Villiger, but was unable to trouble Andrea Jaeger, and Switzerland was beaten easily in the tie. Her most notable performance on tour was reaching the fourth round of the 1981 Wimbledon Championships as a qualifier. Having received a bye in the opening round, Pasquale started with a second round win over Kathy Rinaldi, who had earlier become the youngest player to win a Wimbledon match, at 14. In the third round she upset 11th seed Dianne Fromholtz, then was eliminated by eventual champion Chris Evert Lloyd 6‚Äì0, 6‚Äì0 to end her run. =Personal life= Now known by her married name Roshardt, she has two sons who competed in tennis. The eldest Robin won the Orange Bowl in 2005 and made two main draw appearances at the Swiss Open Gstaad. Younger son Luca played on the international juniors circuit.

History  In 1932, a small hospital was opened and was called by the locals as 'Hong Ya Thai' (meaning Thai Hospital) as it was used to distinguish the hospital to another hospital officially named Overbrook Hospital, or 'Hong Ya Farang' (meaning Foreigner Hospital) run by the Church of Christ in Thailand. Following the coup in 1932, the Khana Ratsadon implemented the Public Health Act B.E. 2477 and under the prime ministership of Gen. Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena as part of the 'Uad Thong' (lit. Flag Boasting) policy in 1936 to boost national identity. This led to the founding of a larger hospital in Chiang Rai as was proposed by the provincial officer of Chiang Rai Province, Phra Phanomnakhararak and had the support of the citizens led by Sihasak and Kimhia Traipaiboon. The construction of the hospital received extensive financial support from local citizens and companies, both Chiang Rai and in adjacent provinces such as Phayao. An area of 19 rai was also donated by the citizens in the area and the hospital was approved by the Ministry of Public Health. The hospital opened on 11 February 1937 as 'Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital', where the term 'Prachanukroh' reflects the aid provided by local citizens in the construction of the hospital. The hospital was also where the twelve members of the 'Wild Boar' junior football team, aged 11 to 17, and their 25-year-old assistant coach were treated following the Tham Luang cave rescue.

It is followed a year later by Sequel to the Five Younger Gallants (Á∫åÂ∞è‰∫îÁæ©). Both sequels were published by Shi Duo (Áü≥Èê∏) who owned the Beijing publisher Wenguang lou (ÊñáÂÖâÊ®ì). The editor was a \\"Captivated-Wind Daoist\\" (È¢®Ëø∑ÈÅì‰∫∫). It's unknown whether he was the same person as \\"Captivated Daoist\\" (ÂÖ•Ëø∑ÈÅì‰∫∫), an editor of the 1879 novel. All three novels claim authorship by the famed storyteller Shi Yukun. During the last decade of the 19th century, the first sequel was reprinted 9 times, 7 in Shanghai and 1 each in Beijing and Chongqing. Authorship controversy While scholars generally agree that Shi Yukun was the genius behind the original novel (even though he most likely died before 1879), how much he contributed to The Five Younger Gallants and its sequel, if at all, is unknown. The 1879 novel (which was published by another Beijing publisher, the Juzhen tang) does not complete its tale by the final chapter, and readers are told to wait for The Five Younger Gallants. However, none of the \\"previewed\\" plotlines at the end of the original was actually found in the sequel. The editors did not deny that the two novels had different origins: According to Shi Duo's preface, his unnamed friend who was an acquaintance with an unnamed disciple of Shi Yukun brought him the original draft by Shi Yukun, with \\"over three hundred chapters, was bound in seventy or eighty volumes, contained over three thousand episodes in three major parts\\", which he acquired \\"without begrudging the great cost\\". \\"Capitvated-Wind Daoist\\" in his preface hinted that the 1879 novel was not authentic as it was noticeably different from the \\"original draft\\" he received.

It uses nonlinear state-space models in continuous time, specified using stochastic or ordinary differential equations. DCM was initially developed for testing hypotheses about neural dynamics. In this setting, differential equations describe the interaction of neural populations, which directly or indirectly give rise to functional neuroimaging data e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG). Parameters in these models quantify the directed influences or effective connectivity among neuronal populations, which are estimated from the data using Bayesian statistical methods.  Procedure  DCM is typically used to estimate the coupling among brain regions and the changes in coupling due to experimental changes (e.g., time or context). A model of interacting neural populations is specified, with a level of biological detail dependent on the hypotheses and available data. This is coupled with a forward model describing how neural activity gives rise to measured responses. Estimating the generative model identifies the parameters (e.g. connection strengths) from the observed data. Bayesian model comparison is used to compare models based on their evidence, which can then be characterised in terms of parameters. DCM studies typically involve the following stages: # Experimental design. Specific hypotheses are formulated and an experiment is conducted. #Data preparation. The acquired data are pre- processed (e.g., to select relevant data features and remove confounds). # Model specification. One or more forward models (DCMs) are specified for each dataset. #Model estimation. The model(s) are fitted to the data to determine their evidence and parameters. # Model comparison. The evidence for each model is used for Bayesian Model Comparison (at the single-subject level or at the group level) to select the best model(s). Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is used to compute a weighted average of parameter estimates over different models. The key stages are briefly reviewed below.  Experimental design  Functional neuroimaging experiments are typically either task-based or examine brain activity at rest (resting state). In task-based experiments, brain responses are evoked by known deterministic inputs (experimentally controlled stimuli). These experimental variables can change neural activity through direct influences on specific brain regions, such as evoked potentials in the early visual cortex, or via a modulation of coupling among neural populations; for example, the influence of attention. These two types of input - driving and modulatory - are parameterized separately in DCM. To enable efficient estimation of driving and modulatory effects, a 2x2 factorial experimental design is often used - with one factor serving as the driving input and the other as the modulatory input. Resting state experiments have no experimental manipulations within the period of the neuroimaging recording. Instead, hypotheses are tested about the coupling of endogenous fluctuations in neuronal activity, or in the differences in connectivity between sessions or subjects. The DCM framework includes models and procedures for analysing resting state data, described in the next section.  Model specification  All models in DCM have the following basic form: \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{z}&=f(z,u,\\\\theta^{(n)}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ y&=g(z,\\\\theta^{(h)})+\\\\epsilon \\\\end{align} The first equality describes the change in neural activity z with respect to time (i.e. \\\\dot{z}), which cannot be directly observed using non-invasive functional imaging modalities. The evolution of neural activity over time is controlled by a neural function f with parameters \\\\theta^{(n)} and experimental inputs u. The neural activity in turn causes the timeseries y (second equality), which are generated via an observation function g with parameters \\\\theta^{(h)}. Additive observation noise \\\\epsilon completes the observation model. Usually, the neural parameters \\\\theta^{(n)} are of key interest, which for example represent connection strengths that may change under different experimental conditions. Specifying a DCM requires selecting a neural model f and observation model g and setting appropriate priors over the parameters; e.g. selecting which connections should be switched on or off. = Functional MRI = The neural model in DCM for fMRI. z1 and z2 are the mean levels of activity in each region. Parameters A are the effective connectivity, B is the modulation of connectivity by a specific experimental condition and C is the driving input. The neural model in DCM for fMRI is a Taylor approximation that captures the gross causal influences between brain regions and their change due to experimental inputs (see picture). This is coupled with a detailed biophysical model of the generation of the BOLD response and the MRI signal, based on the Balloon model of Buxton et al., which was supplemented with a model of neurovascular coupling. Additions to the neural model have included interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neural populations and non-linear influences of neural populations on the coupling between other populations. DCM for resting state studies was first introduced in Stochastic DCM, which estimates both neural fluctuations and connectivity parameters in the time domain, using Generalized Filtering. A more efficient scheme for resting state data was subsequently introduced which operates in the frequency domain, called DCM for Cross-Spectral Density (CSD). Both of these can be applied to large-scale brain networks by constraining the connectivity parameters based on the functional connectivity. Another recent development for resting state analysis is Regression DCM implemented in the Tapas software collection (see Software implementations). Regression DCM operates in the frequency domain, but linearizes the model under certain simplifications, such as having a fixed (canonical) haemodynamic response function. The enables rapid estimation of large-scale brain networks. Models of the cortical column used in EEG/MEG/LFP analysis. Self-connections on each population are present but not shown for clarity. Left: DCM for ERP. Right: Canonical Microcircuit (CMC). 1=spiny stellate cells (layer IV), 2=inhibitory interneurons, 3=(deep) pyramidal cells and 4=superficial pyramidal cells. = EEG / MEG = DCM for EEG and MEG data use more biologically detailed neural models than fMRI, due to the higher temporal resolution of these measurement techniques. These can be classed into physiological models, which recapitulate neural circuity, and phenomenological models, which focus on reproducing particular data features. The physiological models can be further subdivided into two classes. Conductance-based models derive from the equivalent circuit representation of the cell membrane developed by Hodgkin and Huxley in the 1950s. Convolution models were introduced by Wilson & Cowan and Freeman in the 1970s and involve a convolution of pre-synaptic input by a synaptic kernel function. Some of the specific models used in DCM are as follows: * Physiological models:  Convolution models: * DCM for evoked responses (DCM for ERP). This is a biologically plausible neural mass model, extending earlier work by Jansen and Rit. It emulates the activity of a cortical area using three neuronal sub-populations (see picture), each of which rests on two operators. The first operator transforms the pre-synaptic firing rate into a Post-Synaptic Potential (PSP), by convolving pre-synaptic input with a synaptic response function (kernel). The second operator, a sigmoid function, transforms the membrane potential into a firing rate of action potentials. * DCM for LFP (Local Field Potentials). Extends DCM for ERP by adding the effects of specific ion channels on spike generation. * Canonical Microcircuit (CMC). Used to address hypotheses about laminar-specific ascending and descending connections in the brain, which underpin the predictive coding account of functional brain architectures. The single pyramidal cell population from DCM for ERP is split into deep and superficial populations (see picture). A version of the CMC has been applied to model multi-modal MEG and fMRI data. *Neural Field Model (NFM). Extends the models above into the spatial domain, modelling continuous changes in current across the cortical sheet.  Conductance models: *Neural Mass Model (NMM) and Mean-field model (MFM). These have the same arrangement of neural populations as DCM for ERP, above, but are based on the Morris-Lecar model of the barnacle muscle fibre, which in turn derives from the Hodgin and Huxley model of the giant squid axon. They enable inference about ligand-gated excitatory (Na+) and inhibitory (Cl-) ion flow, mediated through fast glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors. Whereas DCM for fMRI and the convolution models represent the activity of each neural population by a single number - its mean activity - the conductance models include the full density (probability distribution) of activity within the population. The 'mean-field assumption' used in the MFM version of the model assumes the density of one population's activity depends only on the mean of another. A subsequent extension added voltage-gated NMDA ion channels. * Phenomenological models: DCM for phase coupling. Models the interaction of brain regions as Weakly Coupled Oscillators (WCOs), in which the rate of change of phase of one oscillator is related to the phase differences between itself and other oscillators.  Model estimation  Model inversion or estimation is implemented in DCM using variational Bayes under the Laplace assumption. This provides two useful quantities: the log marginal likelihood or model evidence \\\\ln{p(ym)}is the probability of observing of the data under a given model. Generally, this cannot be calculated explicitly and is approximated by a quantity called the negative variational free energy F, referred to in machine learning as the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). Hypotheses are tested by comparing the evidence for different models based on their free energy, a procedure called Bayesian model comparison. Model estimation also provides estimates of the parameters p(\\\\thetay), for example connection strengths, which maximise the free energy. Where models differ only in their priors, Bayesian Model Reduction can be used to derive the evidence and parameters of nested or reduced models analytically and efficiently.  Model comparison  Neuroimaging studies typically investigate effects that are conserved at the group level, or which differ between subjects. There are two predominant approaches for group-level analysis: random effects Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) and Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB). Random Effects BMS posits that subjects differ in terms of which model generated their data - e.g. drawing a random subject from the population, there might be a 25% chance that their brain is structured like model 1 and a 75% chance that it is structured like model 2. The analysis pipeline for the BMS approach procedure follows a series of steps: # Specify and estimate multiple DCMs per subject, where each DCM (or set of DCMs) embodies a hypothesis. # Perform Random Effects BMS to estimate the proportion of subjects whose data were generated by each model # Calculate the average connectivity parameters across models using Bayesian Model Averaging. This average is weighted by the posterior probability for each model, meaning that models with greater probability contribute more to the average than models with lower probability. Alternatively, Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB) can be used, which specifies a hierarchical model over parameters (e.g., connection strengths). It eschews the notion of different models at the level of individual subjects, and assumes that people differ in the (parametric) strength of connections. The PEB approach models distinct sources of variability in connection strengths across subjects using fixed effects and between-subject variability (random effects). The PEB procedure is as follows: # Specify a single 'full' DCM per subject, which contains all the parameters of interest. # Specify a Bayesian General Linear Model (GLM) to model the parameters (the full posterior density) from all subjects at the group level. # Test hypotheses by comparing the full group-level model to reduced group-level models where certain combinations of connections have been switched off.  Validation  Developments in DCM have been validated using different approaches: * Face validity establishes whether the parameters of a model can be recovered from simulated data. This is usually performed alongside the development of each new model (E.g.). * Construct validity assesses consistency with other analytical methods. For example, DCM has been compared with Structural Equation Modelling and other neurobiological computational models. * Predictive validity assesses the ability to predict known or expected effects. This has included testing against iEEG / EEG / stimulation and against known pharmacological treatments.  Limitations / drawbacks  DCM is a hypothesis- driven approach for investigating the interactions among pre-defined regions of interest. It is not ideally suited for exploratory analyses. Although methods have been implemented for automatically searching over reduced models (Bayesian Model Reduction) and for modelling large-scale brain networks, these methods require an explicit specification of model space. In neuroimaging, approaches such as psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis may be more appropriate for exploratory use; especially for discovering key nodes for subsequent DCM analysis. The variational Bayesian methods used for model estimation in DCM are based on the Laplace assumption, which treats the posterior over parameters as Gaussian. This approximation can fail in the context of highly non-linear models, where local minima may preclude the free energy from serving as a tight bound on log model evidence. Sampling approaches provide the gold standard; however, they are time consuming and have typically been used to validate the variational approximations in DCM.  Software implementations  DCM is implemented in the Statistical Parametric Mapping software package, which serves as the canonical or reference implementation (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/). It has been re-implemented and developed in the Tapas software collection (https://www.tnu.ethz.ch/en/software/tapas.html) and the VBA toolbox (https://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/).

Although they are roughly away, they have one of the highest proper motions of any star in the sky, travelling over 3.5 arcseconds every year. The stars are believed to originate from outside of the Milky Way, likely from a destroyed, unusually dusty satellite galaxy. They have an extremely low metallicity, only about 3.5% that of the Sun, with unusual chemical abundances very different from those of stars formed anywhere in the galaxy. Because of this, they are considered subdwarfs, and are less luminous than a main-sequence star of the same spectral type would be. Binary system It is unknown if HD 134439 and 134440 are actually orbiting each other, as at their distance, they would have to be a minimum apart from each other, which would make them one of the widest binary systems known. Further adding to this, using Gaia data, HD 134440 appears to be light years further than HD 134439, resulting in a true separation of light years from each other. If they are orbiting each other, they would have an orbital period on the scale of million years, making them one of the longest period binary systems known as well. Destroyed planet In a 2018 study, it was found that HD 134440 had a noticeably higher metallicity than HD 134439, which could be potentially explained by the star having engulfed a planet orbiting it, suggesting that it may be possible for planets to form even around stars with extremely low content of planet-forming material.

Written in assembly language and COBOL, the IMF was originally created by IBM for the IRS in the 1960s to run with an IBM System/360 and associated tape storage system. The IMF is frequently identified as a legacy system in need of modernization.  Description  The IMF stores an individual's name, taxpayer identification number, address, income, deductions, credits, payments received, refunds issued and taxes dismissed. The IMF stores over 100 million Americans individual taxpayers' data. The IMF application is a system consisting of a series of batch runs, data records and files. The IMF system receives individual tax submissions in electronic format and processes them through a pre-posting phase. It then posts and analyzes the transactions which produces output in the form of Refund Data, Notice Data, Reports and information feeds to other entities and departments.  Age  The IMF system began operation in the 1960s and is still used today, and is considered well overdue for modernization. Portions of the system are programmed in COBOL and others directly in assembly language. In a 2018 report to Congress, the Government Accountability Office identified the IMF and other IT systems at the IRS as \\"facing significant risks due to their reliance on legacy programming languages, outdated hardware, and a shortage of human resources with critical skills\\". The IMF and other legacy systems have been named as obstacles that prevent the IRS from acting quickly in exigent circumstances. In the weeks following the passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the IRS attempted to rapidly disburse tens of millions of one-time economic stimulus payments, requiring code changes to the IMF and the creation of an associated online interface for taxpayers to view and update their payment information. However, the effort was only partially successful as many taxpayers received the wrong payment amount or were unable to view their payment status.

After many years working as a journalist for different newspapers and radio stations, Hern√°ndez-Luike created the news agency Motor-Press in 1956. The next year, he acquired the motorbike magazine Motociclismo. In 1961, Luike started Autopista, a car weekly. By 1975, Motor- Press published over twenty different magazines. In 1978, Luike-motorpress was formed by the merger of German company and Motor-Press. In the following twenty years, Luike-motorpress added new titles to the previous ones (Motociclismo, Autopista, Auto Mec√°nica, La Moto and Autom√≥vil), Autoverde, Autov√≠a, Avi√≥n Revue, Bicisport, Bike, Coche Actual, Motor Cl√°sico, Moto Verde and Navegar. In 1993, Luike-motorpress expanded to Portugal, M√©xico, Argentina, and Brasil. In partnership with Televisa, the company launched Autom√≥vil Panamericano in Mexico in 1995. Juan Hern√°ndez-Luike, one of Hern√°ndez- Luike's sons, managed the new magazine for the first few years. By 1998, Luike-motorpress was the largest motor-related magazine publisher in Spain and the German group, which owned 51 percent of Luike-motorpress, bought the remaining 49 percent from Hern√°ndez-Luike and his family. Hern√°ndez-Luike published Tribuna, a weekly general interest magazine, for a few years then, in 2001, he returned to motor publishing by joining Ediaction News, a publishing house found by Javier Herrero‚Äîa motorcycling journalist and Luike's brother-in-law. Under his leadership, Ediaction News's Autof√°cil magazine became the sales leader among car magazines in Spain in 1992. In 2004, Ediaction News partnered with to create (LIDER). LIDER published Autof√°cil, Car & Tecno, F√≥rmula Moto, Quad & Jet, Todo Terreno, and others. LIDER partnered with Dennis Publishing to bring the magazine evo to Spain in 2016‚ÄîCar & Tecno magazine became evo magazine. The book was published 2016 detailing Hern√°ndez-Luike's 60-year career as a motor journalist. As of mid-2018 Hern√°ndez-Luike worked as the founding president of LIDER which published the print magazines Autof√°cil, evo, Moto Cat√°logo, Scooting, Todo Terreno and the online magazines F√≥rmulamoto and Autofacil. Hern√°ndez-Luike's son, Juan Hern√°ndez-Luike, serves as CEO. Hern√°ndez-Luike awards the annual (Luike Motor Stars) to the best-selling cars and motorbikes and to special personalities. Spanish motorbike champion Angel Nieto received one of these stars in 2018, posthumously. The blind astronomer Wanda D√≠az-Merced has also received a star. Racing career Besides publishing about motorbikes, Hern√°ndez-Luike also raced them. In 1959, Virgilio Hern√°ndez Rivadulla and Hern√°ndez-Luike won the Madrid to Florence FIM Rally.

He established the trustee and receivership business which would eventually become Clarkson Gordon & Co in 1864. Life and career Thomas was born in Scotter, Lincolnshire in 1802 to Anglican parents, he emigrated to York, Upper Canada in 1832 following the death of his first wife. He began specialising in goods on commission, specifically grain and was in partnership with Thomas Brunskill of Thornhill in 1845. By the later half of the 1840s, Clarkson participated in several financial ventures in Upper Canada; first serving as president of the Annexation Association, before becoming involved in the newly formed Stock Exchange. He was one of the original founders of the Toronto Board of Trade, serving as president from 1852 to 1859. On his retirement from this post, he expressed caution with the problems of trade in Canada under current policies. Thomas supported reducing tariffs on trade, and campaigned hard for reduced legislation on trade restriction laws, tariffs, and anti-immigration. Alongside other grain merchants, he established the Bank of Toronto, and served as director from 1856 to 1858. The economic depression following 1857 saw some of his ventures fail, notably the Toronto and Georgian Bay Canal Company, a venture which he appeared at the head of the list of incorporators of the company a year earlier and chaired investor meetings in 1854. Thomas then moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where economic growth proved better prospects. Alongside his sons Benjamin Reid and Robert Guy, Thomas established T Clarkson and Sons, a grain and produce commission business which Robert Guy continued to operate upon Thomas‚Äô return to Canada in 1864. There, Thomas became an assignee in bankruptcy for the province and contributed substantially toward early accounting practices in Canada.David Mackenzie, Clarkson Gordon Story: 125 years (1989 Clarkson Gordon) 7 This company, Clarkson, Hunter and Company, became the foundation for the accounting firm Clarkson Gordon & Co. By 1872, Thomas had suffered a paralytic stroke and was unable to continue operating the grain storage elevator he purchased in 1869, his work with the Produce Merchants Exchange, nor his assignee business. Clarkson died in Toronto soon after in 1874. His son, Edward Roper Curzon Clarkson, would grow Thomas‚Äô trustee and receivership business into Clarkson Gordon & Co to one of the largest accounting firms in Canada until its merger with Ernst & Young in the 1980s. His son was a pioneer corporate rescues in Canada, eventually convincing the financial institutions who sought his counsel in winding-up to allow him to operate the business as a going concern.

Career =Club= Born and raised in South Africa (Krugersdorp, Transvaal Province), as a teenager Wallace featured against the Aberdeen side managed by Paddy Travers that was touring the country in 1937. A year later, Travers became Clyde boss and soon invited the player over to sign for his new club. The move was successful: Wallace (playing at inside left to accommodate Willie Martin) opened the scoring in the 1939 Scottish Cup Final, a 4‚Äì0 win over Motherwell which secured the trophy for the first time in Clyde history.Scottish Cup final: 80th anniversary for Clyde side that held the trophy longest, BBC Sport, 27 May 2019 He is also one of a small group of players to have scored four goals in a match for the Bully Wee.

After the conflict ended, in 1946 Wallace moved to Dunfermline Athletic, then in late 1947 signed for Albion Rovers, helping the Coatbridge club to gain promotion to the top tier. The subsequent 1948‚Äì49 Scottish Division One campaign ended in relegation with only eight points collected, but remains a significant point in Rovers' history as the last time they played among the nation's elite. In one of his final appearances, Wallace scored the consolation goal in a 4‚Äì1 defeat to Rangers which meant that the Gers won the championship after title rivals Dundee unexpectedly lost. In 1949, Wallace accepted an offer from Llanelly, a lower-league club from Wales with ambitions to become full members of the Football League. Joining as a player-coach under Jack Goldsborough, Wallace played a large part in persuading former Albion Rovers teammate Jock Stein to join the club. However, having been promoted to the Southern League, Llanelly were unsuccessful in their Football League applications and their fortunes declined as investment and interest in the project waned. Wallace also served a period as Llanelly manager. =International= Despite his birthplace, Wallace made three appearances for Scotland in unofficial wartime fixtures, scoring a brace in a 3‚Äì2 win over England in February 1941; however the other two caps were in defeats to the same opposition. In the last of these, a 4‚Äì0 loss at Hampden Park, Wallace reacted to rough treatment from England captain Stan Cullis by grabbing the defender by the groin. The referee took no action at the time, but the SFA decided afterwards that Wallace would not be considered for internationals again. He had also been selected by the Scottish Football League XI in 1941 (the representative match was arranged even though the league itself had been suspended) and was among the scorers again, albeit in a 3‚Äì2 defeat by The Football League XI.

At the heart of this industry lies The Central Valley of California, a vital agricultural hub for the state and country. Consisting of both the San Joaquin Valley and Sacramento Valley, the Central Valley has an estimated two thirds of the state‚Äôs cropland with 7 million acres. California is also the leading dairy producer in the country, with 1.8 million mature cow in the Central Valley contributing to 80% of California‚Äôs dairies. By being a crucial region for large agricultural output in a state that often suffers from drought, water quantity and quality have been a leading concern for the Central Valley.Contaminated groundwater in the Central Valley of California is a growing problem in many of the agriculture-based communities based in the area. Groundwater in the Central Valley is now a resource that is being threatened due to contamination overuse and is a public health concern for the industries and communities that depend on this as their leading water source. Combined with the overdraft of the underground aquifers, groundwater contamination is becoming increasingly worrisome as the amount of clean groundwater dwindles down. Near-term solutions to this growing problem are often costly and hard to implement in a timely manner while also clearing the water as safe to use. Currently nitrates are the most abundant of these pollutants in the Central Valley due to the copious amounts of agricultural runoff that comes from the numerous farms in the valley. Concentration of naturally occurring arsenic is also an issue.  History  The pumping of groundwater has been happening in the valley since 1850 when residents began to construct pumps to help make up for the lack of surface water in the area. At the turn of the 20th century, California established itself as a leading agricultural state due to its technological advancements in land management, irrigation and machinery. The Central Valley had the ideal economic and climate conditions for a diverse range of crop growth and drew in wealthy landowners to grow their industry in the region. Throughout the early 1900s, technology for waste management did not advance at the same speed as the growth in agriculture. This makes these aquifers extremely important because groundwater supplies much of the water needed for agricultural purposes and serves as the only source of water for several communities throughout the valley. However, there is not a reciprocal amount of water available to recharge the aquifers and recent years have seen an increase in wells drying up. This overdraft of groundwater is causing numerous problems for farmers throughout the valley and is only made worse with the effects of climate change. Groundwater contaminated by nitrates comes from 50 years of unregulated management of livestock waste disposal, septic systems and commercial fertilizers. The Californian Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 was the first of its kind to specify how to manage groundwater in way that would not harm or endanger future generation's access to clean groundwater. Before this act, there were no regulations surrounding groundwater management other than the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. Even these acts do not totally protect Central Valley residents. Consistent monitoring didn‚Äôt begin until the 1950s, with only 13,000 tests completed in the 1980s. Today, the California Spatio Temporal Information on Nitrate in Groundwater (CASTING) database comes from over 133,329 tests in the Central Valley region. With advancements in testing and research, the Central Valley is increasing in efforts to reduce the impact of nitrate water pollution that is expected to drastically increase in the next couple decades.  Regulations and standards  Set by the California Department of Public Health, the Maximum Contaminant Level of nitrates, in CCR ¬ß63341, are 45 milligrams per liter (mg/L) for nitrate as NO3 (equivalent to 10 mg/L for nitrate as nitrogen or ‚ÄúN‚Äù); 10 mg/L for nitrate plus nitrite as N; and 1 mg/L for nitrite as N. Public wells are required to annual water testing, where they submit their nitrate levels to the Department of Health, however private wells are not subject to do this. Though 98% of the state has access to water with a suitable level of nitrates, there are disparities in who does not have access to clean water. Despite modern data and methods for agricultural safety, 92 water systems in the Central Valley were attached to wells containing illegal levels of nitrates between 2005 and 2008, impacting the 1,335,000 residents in the area. Historically, programs to address the public health and economic impact nitrates have on communities and industries run at around $1 million each, making this a costly and slow process for change. The Californian Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 was the first of its kind to specify how to manage groundwater in a way that would not harm or endanger future generation's access to clean groundwater. Signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2014, this three-bill legislative package created a framework for preserving and managing groundwater at the local and state level. This creates a regulatory process, mandating that Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs) to adopt Ground Water Sustainability Plans (GSPs) to manage supply. Before this act, regulations were only at the federal level with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, and failed to protect Central Valley residents. Based on these laws, farms and oil drilling sites could not put wastewater into the ground if it impacted clean drinking water; however, if water was not suitable to drink, these sources could dump lethal waste into the water, thus eliminating any access to the aquifer for residents.  Sources of nitrogen  Manure, fertilizer, septic and natural causes are the leading sources of nitrates in groundwater. Depending on the area in the Central Valley, manure and fertilizer are the largest sources of nitrates. Fertilizers have roughly 11.5 million tons of nitrogen added to them annually in the United States. The nitrogen in the fertilizer is then released into the atmosphere as ammonia gas or the rest is saturated into the soil and taken up by plants. The nitrogen in the soil is converted to nitrates, which is the main form nitrogen is found in for groundwater contamination. In the U.S. 53% of nitrates originate from fertilizers, making this a priority for Californian officials. Manure produces around 6.5 million tons of nitrogen, that when not handled properly can contaminate soil and water sources. Natural causes, such as nitrates occurring in crops, is consistently a minimal source.  Population impact  There have been several studies done researching the impact of nitrogen on human health. The main finding that is consistent through all of the studies is the exposure period. In order for an actual risk of cancer to be significantly higher, the exposure period must be at least 5 and in some cases 10 years. This seems extensive, however when receiving pushback from the government, 10 years does not seem like such a lengthy period. Women who consume water with nitrate over 5 mg/L are at a higher risk of thyroid cancer. The important thing to realize here is that this 5 mg/L is 5 mg below the federally accepted limit. When consumed, the nitrate will compete with the iodine in the body, in which one is taken up by the thyroid. When the thyroid takes up nitrogen over iodine, the thyroid begins to lose function. This exposure is only 5 years before the risk of thyroid cancer increases significantly. Individuals are at a higher risk for colon and rectal cancer when they consume water with high (above 5 mg/L) nitrate levels. Exposure for 10+ years is associated with increased colon cancer risk among susceptible populations. (,). These populations are usually communities that lack access to fresh fruits and vegetables, as a lack of vitamins C is a major risk factor. Drinking water and dietary sources of nitrate and nitrite cause increased cancer risks due to the nitrate compounds reacting with amines and amides to form carcinogens. There is also an increased risk of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. A particular study indicated that long term exposure to elevated nitrate levels in the drinking water can contribute to the risk of NHL. The exact process of how this happens is still being researched.

In 1910 Hitchcock travelled with her friend Lily Lind to Ireland to study midwifery at Dublin‚Äôs Rotunda Hospital. At the time World War I broke out, the two women were living and working in London as private nurses. Hitchcock and Lind volunteered their services to the newly formed French Flag Nursing Corps (FFNC), At the end of October 1914 the pair were part of the first contingent of nine nurses that the FFNC sent to France. They were posted to the Hotel Dieu in Rouen, where they worked alongside French nuns to nurse French, Belgian, Algerian, Turkish, and German soldiers. In mid-December the pair were moved to Bordeaux, to work in a large military hospital there. Next, from the end of January to June 1915, they were posted to the small town of Bergues near the Belgian border. There they nursed victims of a typhoid epidemic. While there, the FFNC nurses were exposed to intensive artillery bombardments which destroyed nearby buildings, forcing them to live in cellars. In July 1915, the pair were moved to Bourbourg and nursed on a hospital barge which ferried sick and wounded soldiers to hospitals via the canals connecting the Belgian city of Nieuport to Dunkirk and Bourbourg in Flanders. In October 1915, Hitchcock and Lind moved again, to a contagious diseases hospital in Steenvoorde. At the end of January 1916, they relocated to Nice as Lind had fallen ill. Initially she thought she had bronchitis, however she was soon diagnosed with tuberculosis, which she had probably contracted while working on the hospital barge. In February Lind moved into a temporary hospital set up at Le Grande Hotel in Grasse. Hitchcock nursed her friend with gargles, inhalations and poultices. In October 1916, both Lind and Hitchcock resigned from the FFNC and left France to travel home to New Zealand on the hospital ship Maheno. However, Lind died on 21 November, shortly after the ship left Colombo, and she was buried at sea. Hitchcock arrived back in Wellington on 23 December 1916. In May 1917, she enlisted in the New Zealand Army Nursing Service; she spent six months working at Trentham military camp in Wellington then left in October 1917 to return to England. From December 1917 until May 1919, Hitchcock was posted to the New Zealand Expeditionary Force‚Äôs general hospitals at Brockenhurst and Codford. On her return to New Zealand, Hitchcock spent some time nursing shell-shocked men at Queen Mary‚Äôs Hospital at Hanmer. She then re-trained as an infant nurse with the Plunket Society and worked as a matron at Karitane Hospitals in Auckland, Dunedin and Wellington. During World War II Hitchcock worked in nurse management with the Royal New Zealand Air Force in Rongotai, Wellington. In 1946 she was awarded an MBE for her military nursing service. Hitchcock died in Palmerston North on 13 March, 1967. During her time in Europe, Hitchcock received several items of trench art and rehabilitative art from soldiers she nursed, and some of these were later donated to Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

It has round or heart-shaped leaf and a dark reddish purple or purplish black flower. It is widespread and common between Bunbury and Albany.  Description  Corybas recurvus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single thin, round or broad heart-shaped leaf long and wide. The leaf is green on the upper surface and silvery green on the lower side. There is a single dark reddish purple or purplish black flower long and wide which leans backwards. The dorsal sepal is long, wide and curves forward over the labellum. The lateral sepals are whitish, about long, wide, joined at their bases and projected forwards. The petals also whitish, about long, wide and taper to a thread-like tip. The labellum is tube-shaped at the base, the tube long, before opening to a dish-shape long, wide, dark reddish purple or purplish black with many broad, blunt teeth around the edge. Flowering occurs from July to September.  Taxonomy  Corybas recurvus was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Toolbrunup and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (recurvus) is a Latin word meaning \\"recurved\\" or \\"curved backwards \\", referring to the flower of this orchid. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements proposed splitting Corybas into smaller genera and placing this species into Corysanthes but the change has not been widely accepted. Distribution and habitat The western helmet orchid is widespread and common between Bunbury and Albany, growing in moist forests. It sometimes grows in large colonies in dense coastal scrub and in plantations of introduced pine. Conservation Corybas recurvus is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Background  The Russian Civil War in Caspian Sea saw previous confrontation between the Soviet Russian Caspian Flotilla against the British Caspian Flotilla, the latter supporting the White movement as part of the Allied intervention. British scored a victory during the Battle of Alexandrovsky Fort, but the harbor was reconquered in April 1920. Royal Navy officially passed the entire flotilla to the White movement on 2 September 1919.  Action  The Soviet Russian Caspian Flotilla gathered a considerable force to attack Anzali. The task force was composed by 4 auxiliary cruisers (Proletariy, Rosa Luxemburg, Pushkin, Bela Kun), 4 destroyers (Karl Liebknecht, Delnyi, Deyatelnyi, Rastoropnyi), two gunboats (Kars and Ardagan) the transport Gretsiya and other minor units. Complete surprise was achieved, a naval shelling in early morning nearly hit the main British headquarters. No organized defense was attempted, while the Persian governor formally accepted the Soviet Russian presence, the White detachment fled the city on ground and the entire flotilla was seized without resistance. Seized ships included: auxiliary cruisers President Kruger, America, Europe, Africa, Dmitry Donskoy, Asia, Slava, Mylutin, Opyt and Merkur, the motor- torpedo-boat carrier (previously seaplane-carrier) Orlenok, the seaplane- carrier (previously m.t.b carrier) Volga, four seaplanes, four motor torpedo boats (former British), 10 merchants, a number of support, auxiliary and minor units in addition to big amount of supplies and ammunition.

In comparison to the classical system, dividend imputation reduces or eliminates the tax disadvantages of distributing dividends to shareholders by only requiring them to pay the difference between the corporate rate and their marginal rate. If the individual‚Äôs average tax rate is lower than the corporate rate, the individual receives a tax refund. The objective of the dividend imputation system is to eliminate double taxation of company profits, once at the corporate level and again on distribution as dividend to shareholders. Under the previous system, the company and shareholders had an incentive for the taxed income of the company to be retained by the company, or for the business activity not to be undertaken using a corporate structure. History  Before 1987, an Australian company would pay company tax on its profits at a flat rate of 49%; and if it then paid a dividend, that dividend was taxed again as income for the shareholder.Act No. 59 of 1987 The company and shareholders had an incentive for the taxed income of the company to be retained by the company. Paying a dividend gave raise to double taxation, once by the company at the corporate rate and then on dividend income in the hands of the company's shareholders. Dividend imputation was introduced in Australia in 1987 to stop this effect and create a \\"level playing field\\". The company tax rate was reduced to 39% in 1988 and 33% in 1993, and increased again in 1995 to 36%, to be reduced to 34% in 2000 and 30% in 2001. Dividend imputation was introduced in 1987, one of a number of tax reforms by the Hawke‚ÄìKeating Labor Government. Prior to that a company would pay company tax on its profits and if it then paid a dividend, that dividend was taxed again as income for the shareholder, i.e. a part owner of the company, a form of double taxation.Act No. 59 of 1987 In 1997, the eligibility rules (below) were introduced by the Howard‚ÄìCostello Liberal Government, with a $2,000 small shareholder exemption. In 1999 that exemption was raised to the present $5,000. In 2000, franking credits became fully refundable, not just reducing tax liability to zero. In 2002, preferential dividend streaming was banned. In 2003, New Zealand companies could elect to join the system for Australian tax they paid. From 2015/16, designated \\"small business entities\\" with an aggregated annual turnover threshold of less than $2 million were eligible for a lower tax rate of 28.5%. Since 1 July 2016, small business entities with aggregated annual turnover of less than $10 million have had a reduced company tax rate of 27.5%. Additionally, the Australian Government announced that from 2017/18, corporate entities eligible for the lower tax rate will be known as \\"base rate entities\\". The small business definition will remain at $10 million from 2017‚Äì18 onwards, however the base rate entity threshold (the aggregated annual turnover threshold under which entities will be eligible to pay a lower tax rate) will continue to rise.  Operation  A shareholder's taxable income is grossed up to include the value of the company tax deemed to have been prepaid on the dividend. This value is also credited to the shareholder. Companies which have paid Australian company tax can declare how much of the tax paid, recorded as franking credit, is to be attached to a dividend. Dividends paid with the maximum franking credit allowable are called fully franked dividends, and Australian-resident shareholders who receive them would declare both the dividends and the associated franking credits (as well as all other ordinary income) on their tax returns. They are also entitled to claim back a credit for the value of the franking credit. Dividends may still be paid by a company when it has no franking credits (perhaps because it has been making tax losses), this is called an unfranked dividend. It may also pay a franked portion and an unfranked portion, known as partly franked. An unfranked dividend (or the unfranked portion) is ordinary income in the hands of the shareholder. For example, if a company makes a profit of $100 and pays company tax of $30 (at 2006 rates) to the tax office, it records the $30 in the franking account. The company now has $70 of retained profit to pay a dividend, either in the same year or later years. When it does so, it may attach a franking credit from its franking account, in proportion to the tax rate. If a $70 dividend is paid it could attach $30 of franking credits, and the franking account is debited by $30. An eligible shareholder receiving a franked dividend declares as income the cash received, plus the franking credit. The franking credit is then credited against the tax payable on their income. The effect is as if the tax office reversed the company tax by giving back the $30 to the shareholder and had them treat the original $100 of profit as income, in the shareholder's hands, like the company was merely a conduit. Thus company profits distributed to eligible shareholders are taxed in their entirety at the shareholder's rate. Profits retained by the company or distributed to ineligible shareholders remain taxed at the corporate rate. Non-resident shareholders are not entitled to claim a tax credit or refund of imputation credits, nor are they required to gross-up their taxable income. Unfranked dividends received by non-residents are subject to a withholding tax, which does not apply to franked dividends. The actual law is complex, the core is in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and other elements are in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Initially, in 1987, excess franking credits over the tax liability were lost, but since 2000, such excess credits have been refundable.  Franking credits  Companies decide what proportion of the dividends they pay will have franking credits attached. This can range from the dividend being fully franked to it being entirely unfranked. A franking credit is a nominal unit of tax paid by companies using dividend imputation. Shareholders who are residents of Australia for tax purposes include in their assessable income the grossed-up dividend amount (being the total of the dividend payable plus the associated franking credits). The income tax payable by the shareholders is calculated, and the franking credits are applied to offset the tax payable. In Australia and New Zealand the end result is the elimination of double taxation of company profits. =Franking credit formula= For a company that pays tax on all its income in Australia, the franking proportion is usually 100% (or 1). However, some companies (particularly those paying tax outside of Australia) have a lower franking proportion. Fully franked dividend Franking Credits = (Dividend Amount / (1 ‚àí Company Tax Rate)) ‚àí Dividend Amount Example - a company pays a 30% company tax rate and distributes a $7.00 dividend to shareholders: Franking Credits = ($7.00 / (1 ‚àí 0.3)) ‚àí $7.00 = ($7.00 / (0.7)) ‚àí $7.00 = $10.00 ‚àí $7.00 = $3.00 Franking Credits = $3.00 The shareholder is credited $3.00. Partially franked dividend Franking Credits from Partial Franking = ((Dividend Amount / (1 ‚àí Company Tax Rate)) ‚àí Dividend Amount) √ó Franking Proportion Example - a company pays a 30% company tax rate but is only eligible for 50% franking and distributed a $7.00 dividend to shareholders: Franking Credits from Partial Franking = (($7.00 / (1 ‚àí 0.3)) ‚àí $7.00) √ó 0.5 = (($7.00 / (0.7)) ‚àí $7.00) √ó 0.5 = ($10.00 ‚àí $7.00) √ó 0.5 = $3.00 √ó 0.5 = $1.50 Franking Credits from Partial Franking = $1.50 The shareholder is credited $1.50.  Refund  Franking credits on dividends received after 1 July 2000 are refundable tax credits. It is a form of tax prepayment, which can reduce a taxpayer's total tax liability, with any excess being refunded. For example, an individual with income below the tax-free threshold ($18,200 since 2011/12) will pay no tax at all and can get a refund of the franking credits in full, after a tax return is lodged. Prior to 1 July 2000 such excess franking credits were lost. For example, an individual at the time with an income below the tax free threshold would lose the value of the tax prepaid, and would merely keep the cash portion of the dividend received.  Investors  A franking credit is income of the shareholder, though it is not received in cash. It is a credit towards tax that may be payable by the shareholder. Thus a franked dividend of $0.70 plus a $0.30 franking credit is equivalent to an unfranked dividend of $1.00, or to bank interest of $1.00, or any other ordinary income of that amount. (It is exactly equivalent because franking credits are fully refundable, as described above.) Franked dividends are often described as a \\"tax effective\\" form of income. The basis for this is that the cash $0.70 looks like it is taxed at a lower rate than other income. For example, for an individual on the top rate of 48.5% (for 2006) the calculation is $0.70 plus $0.30 credit is $1.00 on which $0.485 tax is payable, but less the $0.30 credit makes $0.185 net tax, which is just 26.4% of the original $0.70. Conversely, an individual on the 20% marginal tax rate actually gets a $0.10 rebate. In this latter case, the rebate looks very much like negative tax. There's nothing inherently wrong with the latter way of thinking about franked dividends, and it is frequently made to demonstrate how franking benefits the investor, but it can be argued a grossing-up like the former is better when comparing yields across different investment opportunities. Restrictions on eligibility  There are restrictions on who can claim franking credits. Those who cannot claim the credit simply declare as income the cash part of the dividend amount received, and ignore the franking credit on the tax return. The \\"holding period rule\\" has applied since 1 July 2000. Its objective is to prevent traders buying shares on the last cum-dividend date and selling them the following day ex-dividend. The typical result would be that the trader would receive the dividend, together with the franking credits, while incurring an equivalent capital loss and qualifying for the franking credit with only overnight risk in holding the shares. An eligible shareholder is one who either: * holds the shares for a continuous period of 45 days or more (not counting purchase and sale days); or 90 days in the case of certain preference shares. This is the \\"holding period rule\\". Shares must be \\"at risk\\" for the necessary period, i.e. not with an offsetting derivatives position for instance, or * has total franking credits for the tax year of less than $5000 (the \\"small shareholder exemption\\") and has not arranged to pass-on the benefits to someone else (the \\"related payments rule\\"). Thus franking credits are not available to short-term traders, only to longer term holders, but with small holders exempted provided it's for their own benefit. The small shareholder exemption is not a \\"first $5000\\", but rather once the $5000 threshold is passed the rule is inoperative and all the shares are under the holding period rule. For the holding period rule, parcels of shares bought and sold at different times are reckoned on a \\"first in, last out\\" basis. Each sale is taken to be of the most recently purchased shares. This prevents a taxpayer buying just before a dividend, selling just after, and asserting it was older shares sold (to try to fulfill the holding period). This \\"first in, last out\\" reckoning may be contrasted with capital gains tax. For capital gains the shareholder can nominate what parcel was sold from among those bought at different times.  Company shareholders  A dividend received by a company shareholder is income of the receiving company, but the dividend income is not grossed-up for the franking credit nor is the receiving company entitled to claim the franking credit as a tax credit. Instead, the franking credit is added directly to the receiving company's franking account, and can be paid out in the same way as franking credits generated by the receiving company. This transfer of credits has made the previous \\"intercorporate rebates\\" allowances redundant. Those rebates had avoided double taxation on dividends paid from one company to another company. Those rebates were part of the original 1936 Taxation Act (section 46), meaning that the principle of eliminating double taxation has been present to some degree in Australian income tax law for a very long time. The company tax rate has changed a few times since the introduction of dividend imputation. In each case transitional rules have been made to maintain the principle of reversing the original tax paid, even if the tax rate has changed. This has been either by separate franking accounts for separate rates (e.g. class A 39%, class B 33%), or making an adjusting recalculation of the credits (e.g. into class C 30%).  Trans-Tasman Imputation  New Zealand companies can apply to join the Australian dividend imputation system (from 2003). Doing so allows them to attach Australian franking credits to their dividends, for Australian tax they have paid. Those credits can then be used by shareholders who are Australian taxpayers, the same as dividends from an Australian company. There are certain anti-tax-avoidance rules to prevent New Zealand companies deliberately streaming Australian franking credits towards their Australian shareholders; credits must be distributed on a pro-rata basis. Note that it is only Australian franking credits which can be used by an Australian taxpayer. New Zealand imputation credits on dividends paid to an Australian shareholder cannot be used against that shareholder's Australian taxes. Dividend streaming A company can determine the level of franking credits it will attach to its dividends, and they are not obliged to attach any franking credits. However, it costs the company nothing to attach the maximum amounts of credits it has available, which is the usual practice to benefit eligible shareholders. It is actually possible for a company to attach more franking credits than it has, but doing so attracts certain tax penalties. Until 2002 it was permissible for companies to direct the flow of franking credits preferentially to one type of shareholder over another so that each could benefit the most as fits their tax circumstances. For example, franking credits are of no use to foreign shareholders, who cannot offset them against withholding tax, but Australian shareholders can claim them as a tax credit. This practice, known as dividend streaming, became illegal in 2002, after which all dividends within a given time frame must be franked to a similar (but need not be identical) degree irrespective of shareholder location or which class of shares they hold. Division 7A and debit loans by private companies Division 7A of the Tax Act applies where there is a loan, payment or the forgiveness of a loan to a shareholder or an associate of a shareholder of a private company.ATO, Loans by private companies When such amounts are not repaid by the end of a financial year they may be treated as unfranked dividends. The total of all dividends a private company can be taken to pay under Division 7A is limited to its \\"distributable surplus\\" for that income year, which includes the retained earnings plus provisions made for accounting purposes.ATO, Distributable surplus An 'associate' is very broad and generally includes a trust under which a shareholder can benefit.ATO, Entities and taxpayers affected This will mean that Division 7A can apply to loans to discretionary trusts and unit trusts in the family group, and sometimes to such trusts not in a family group.  Effective elimination of company tax and thus incentives  To a large extent, dividend imputation makes company tax irrelevant. This is because every dollar that a company pays in company tax could potentially be claimed by an eligible shareholder as franking credit, and the revenue flowing to the government would ultimately be received only at the shareholder's tax rate. However, profits retained for use by the company and income distributed as dividends to foreign investors remain taxed at the corporate tax rate. One effect is that this has reduced the effectiveness of tax incentives for corporations. If a corporation was given a tax break and no tax was paid, then its income would not generate franking credits. In turn, this meant that the shareholders received fewer credits along with their dividends, and paid tax on the full value as ordinary income. It also reduces the benefit of corporate tax avoidance in the same way. The net result is that each tax break a corporation received was countered by a matching increase in the tax burden of shareholders, leaving shareholders in exactly the same position as had more tax been paid by the corporation. Thus, to the extent that corporate directors acted so as to increase shareholder wealth, tax incentives would not influence corporate behaviour. When gross company tax is reported by Treasury, it is unclear whether the number generally includes the effect of the corresponding franking credits.  Politics and economics  Dividend imputation has been uncontroversial over most of its lifetime. Investors and their advisors recognise the benefits and are supportive. In October 2006, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia released a report, Tax Cuts to Compete, concluding that dividend imputation had proved an inefficient means of reducing Australia's cost of capital. The report, authored by prominent economist Dr Nicholas Gruen, argued that the elimination of imputation would allow the funding of a substantial corporate tax cut. This would attract foreign investment and thus increase economic growth, it said.

Early life  Beier was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. Her father is Filipino and her mother is of British, Austrian and Scottish descent. Her father works as a hairstylist and salon owner. Her mother is a small business entrepreneur. Her great-grandfather was a working pianist in Victoria, Canada. Throughout her childhood, Beier's family moved three times. She attended three different elementary schools and three different high schools. They lived in a wealthy horse village for a period of time, where she cultivated a love of animals and nature and became an avid equestrian. She would often sleep in barns to get up early to trail ride. She took horseback riding lessons and would muck barns in exchange for lessons. Her parents eventually separated and later reconciled. She describes her childhood as \\"difficult and at times confusing,\\" and says that this gave her a great sense of independence from a young age. She started playing classical piano at the age of 5. She also tap danced as a child briefly and was an avid equestrian. Beier attended The Royal Conservatory of Music for over 10 years. She had a very strict piano teacher who suffered from alcoholism, and would sometimes leave her classes crying and in fear. She persevered for the love of music, and has stated that she is thankful for the strong foundation in music she received due to this experience. Beier attended an all-girls private Catholic high school, where she gained a background in feminist theory. She attended Simon Fraser University, where she earned a BA in Criminology. Her degree granted her an understanding of society and human behavior, and she became an advocate for criminal justice and prison reform. Beier originally planned to go into law before embarking on a career in film and music.  Career  =Film and production= Beier began her career as a theatre actress and wrote poetry as a hobby. She later pursued a career in filmmaking as a producer. She wrote and produced the documentary I Met A Man From Burma, which told the story of Ler Wah Lo Bo, a Burmese refugee and former revolutionary fighter. She then wrote and performed in a native rights film entitled Covered, a docudrama highlighting a 1966 television interview of the legendary folk singer and activist Buffy Sainte-Marie. Beier played the lead role of Sainte-Marie. She also acted in the short film It Remains Unsaid, where she starred as Sage, the principal antagonist. Film festivals and accolades Her film I Met A Man From Burma was accepted into the Vancouver International Film Festival Reel Causes Program, which partners with Canadian filmmakers dedicated to addressing global social justice issues. After sending the Canadian immigration minister a copy of the film, Beier was told that the film's subject Ler Wah Lo Bo would be upgraded from refugee status to full Canadian citizenship. In 2014, Beier's film Covered won the Best Experimental category at the Imaginenative Film Festival in Toronto, and was also accepted into the Toronto International Film Festival, Whistler Film Festival and a number of other international film festivals. =Musical career= Playing the role of Buffy Sainte-Marie inspired Beier to focus on music. In 2016 she released her first album, Hero & The Sage‚Äô‚Äô produced by Bret Higgins of the Great Lake Swimmers. Songs from the album were well-received and got significant air time on radio stations across Canada. In 2017, Beier produced California 1970, a 6 track EP, at The Village (studio) in Los Angeles, with guitarist Adam Zimmon, drummer Tripp Beam, bassist Eliot Lorango, and keyboardist Sasha Smith. Additional vocals for the EP were recorded at the studio of Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum in Hollywood. Beier then released a single called ‚ÄúForgiveness‚Äù with Grammy award winning producer Doug Boehm. She then toured with her band throughout Toronto, Berlin, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York. The band played at Riverfest in Ontario, Canada alongside MGMT. They have also played at Canadian Music Week, headlined at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, and at the Rockwood Music Hall in New York City. Beier's music has been described as a blend of folk, alternative, country, and pop. Her second album ‚ÄúSuper Bloom‚Äù was produced by Ken Coomer, (original founding drummer of Wilco) in Nashville in 2019 and released on Manimal Vinyl Records in 2020, a Los Angeles-based record label that had previously released debut album for Yoko Ono, Moby and Asia Argento and more.

Beier has openly admitted she has never had a strong relationship with her father. She believes that past trauma of that incident affected her father and prevented him from forming a healthy relationship with her while she was growing up. Beier has stated that she spent several years working with a psychotherapist to reconcile with this, as well as other traumas from her childhood, and attributes her sense of identity to songwriting and psychotherapy. Beier frequently uses social media, especially Instagram, to advocate for reducing plastic waste and preserving the environment.

(b) the acquisition... if direct > or indirect control of the whole or parts of one or more other > undertakings.\\" Art. 3(1), Regulation 139/2004, the European Community Merger > Regulation This usually means that one firm buys out the shares of another.Art. 3(1), Regulation 139/2004, the European Community Merger Regulation The reasons for oversight of economic concentrations by the state are the same as the reasons to restrict firms who abuse a position of dominance, only that regulation of mergers and acquisitions attempts to deal with the problem before it arises, ex ante prevention of creating dominant firms. In the case of [T-102/96] Gencor Ltd v. Commission [1999] ECR II-753 the EU Court of First Instance wrote merger control is there \\"to avoid the establishment of market structures which may create or strengthen a dominant position and not need to control directly possible abuses of dominant positions\\". = Exemptions = The exceptions to the CMA‚Äôs duty to refer. The CMA may decide not to refer a merger for a Phase two investigation if they had a genuine reason to believe that; the market concerned is of insufficient importance to justify a reference i.e. the De Minimis exception, this exception may only be available where the affected markets are worth less than ¬£10m in aggregate. The CMA may also make an exception to their duty to refer, if there are any relevant consumer benefits arising out of the merger and that these benefits would outweigh the substantial lessening of competition. The CMA may also make an exception to their duty to refer in the case of anticipated mergers, this is when the arrangements concerned are insufficiently far advanced, or insufficiently likely to proceed. Another exception which the CMA may consider, might be the merger or acquisition of a firm which is inevitably going to fail or become insolvent, and taking it over would not have a significant impact on competition as that was bound to happen regardless of whether the merger took place.  Merger types  = Horizontal = A horizontal merger takes place when two or more competitors merge into one, or one of it directly or indirectly controls another undertaking as a whole when they are operating in the same product and geographic market. For example, Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merged to become GlaxoSmithKline in 2000. is a typical example of horizontal merger in that they operate in the same markets. Horizontal mergers have two kinds of effects: unilateral and coordinated. The unilateral effect arises as the competition between the merging companies is eliminated. The subsequent increase in marketing power may harm consumers through higher prices and/or reduced product diversity.The coordinated effect occurs when a market condition such as product homogeneity allows the merged entity to behave in an anti-competitive way such as price raising. = Vertical = A vertical merger takes place when two or more businesses that operate at different levels merge. Such a merger leads to 'double marginalisation', resulting in more profit for the organisation if, e.g., material cost is reduced substantially or production processes are improved. Vertical integration may be backwards or forward, and may lead to a foreclosure of the upmarket if the upstream firm has a near monopoly over e.g. raw material. An example of vertical integration, is that of Apple, who control the manufacturing as well as distribution of their products.  = Conglomerate = A conglomerate merger arises when merger partners generally operate in separate markets. In cases where the merger results in smaller product lines, e.g., to remove overlaps, reducing consumer choice. Conglomerate mergers may occur for a few reasons i.e. increasing market share or perhaps merging to reduce the risk of loss through diversification; Tata Group is one of the world's most diversified businesses and a great example of a conglomerate.  Substantive test  The New Merger Regulation was enacted by the European Commission in May 2004. The regulation reformulated the \\"substantive test\\", which closes a loophole in the old test.See, eg J Fingleton and D Nolan, \\"Mind the Gap: Reforming the EU Merger Regulation\\", Mercato, Concorrenza, Regole, 29 May 2003; J Vickers, \\"How to Reform the EC Merger Test?\\", speech at the EC/IBA Merger Control Conference, Brussels, 8 November 2002; N Levy, \\"Dominance v SLC, A Subtle Distinction\\", Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton, 6 November 2002. The Substantive test, is a test for whether a merger has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition (SLC). The leading case was Airtours v Commission.From the judgment of the General Court of the European Union. See Case T-342/99, Airtours v Commission, [2002] ECR II-2585 After Airtours plc and First Choice Holidays plc merged, the commission argued that due to a unique holiday package selling in the UK market, 'collective dominant position' was gained by Airtours, since it was selling a high number of the holiday package. The Commission thereby blocked the (hostile) merger.The Airtours Case: Collective Dominance and Implicit Collusion In European Merger Analysis by David Harbord This revealed the need for an updated substantive test. The new substantive test, also termed a 'dominance test'. The new substantive test assesses the extent to which the merger decreases competition. It was the case of Airtours v Commission in 2002 which ultimately urged the commission to recommend a change in the EU merger regulation. Initially the commission prohibited the merger between Airtours and First Choice on the basis that together they would create a collective dominant position in the market, and may have created an incentive for the remaining firms in the oligopolistic market to change their behaviour and restrict market capacity. .\\" The Commission believed it was \\"sufficient that the merger makes it rational for the oligopolists...to act individually in ways which will substantially reduce competition between them.\\" The decision to prohibit the merger made by the commission was annulled by the Court of First Instance, the Court recalled that if a concentration is to be prohibited, it must have had the direct and immediate effect of creating or strengthening a collective dominant position significantly and lastingly impeding effective competition in the market, the CFI found that the commission had not been able to successfully prove that the concentration would have created a collective dominant position capable of restricting competition in the United Kingdom short-haul package holiday market. The case created a significant level of uncertainty in EU merger law as there was a perceived gap in the law- the gap of the non-collusive oligopoly. It was in response to the concerns raised regarding the ‚Äúdominance test‚Äù and the non-collusive oligopoly gap in EU merger regulation, and as such the European Council adopted regulation 139/2004. Richard Whish described the EUMR of 2004 as \\"disarmingly simple\\" in that the 'dominance test' remains but the question posed by the test is reversed. The new test is known as the 'SIEC' (significant impediment to effective competition) test.  = Brexit = The United Kingdom is inevitably set to leave the European Union by the end of 2020. The effect of Brexit is vastly unclear especially considering the uncertainty behind Brexit itself, as is the opinion of Andrea Coscelli, the acting chief of the CMA. The extent of the implications that Brexit will have, is dependent on whether there is a withdrawal agreement or a no-deal Brexit. A potential withdrawal agreement would provide the CMA with a transition period in which EUMR cases would be reviewed by both the European Commission and the UK, until the period comes to an end. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, this would amount to a complete separation between the EU and the UK, as such the CMA would have to exercise its affairs independently from the day the UK leaves the EU. After withdrawing from the EU, the UK will no longer be obliged to interpret national law in accordance with EU law and companies may have to comply with divergent systems.

Their purpose was to maintain order and discipline in stations, ensuring swift movement of troops and hardware, advise and direct soldiers moving through these stations, and to check travel papers, looking for deserters as well as escaped prisoners of war. They were a crucial part of the German military in a period where trains were the fastest way of transporting men and military hardware, and when train stations were a major target of Allied attacks. The Bahnhofswache were responsible for patrolling all large rail stations, depots and interchanges. Their duties included checking Kennkarte, identification and leave passes of soldiers, checking for deserters, screening civilian passengers, and helping the stations to run efficiently. The Zugwache were similar in most ways to the Bahnhofswache however they acted as police on- board the trains and were usually present only in the major train stations. They had the more dangerous duties of guarding trains traveling through enemy territory and dealing with acts of sabotage by Partisans or Resistance. They were also assigned to guard High Command Staff using the train system. The Bahnhofswache wore no distinguishing corps badge or colour other than their normal military police however an armband or more commonly a gorget were worn with 'Bahnhofswache' imprinted on them and two numbers, one indicating the military district and the other indicating the unit number. Zugwache troops wore a similar gorget but with the monogram WB (Wach Bataillon) and 'Zugwache' imprinted on it.

He was the Presiding Bishop of the Methodist Church Ghana. He has served as the head of the Methodist Church in The Gambia as well as the Bishop of Accra. He spent the early years of his ministry as an assistant minister at Roundhay Methodist Church in Leeds, United Kingdom. Early life and education Titus Awortwi Pratt was born to Charles Awotwi Pratt and Grace Awotwi Pratt on 5 December 1947. He was the sixth out of ten children born to his parents. His father was also a Methodist minister and served as the forth president of the autonomous Methodist Church Ghana in 1977. Awortwi Pratt had his basic and secondary education at Wesley Grammar School in Accra. He was awarded his professional teacher's certificate after three years of training at Komenda Teachers Training College.  Methodist minister  Pratt attended the Trinity Theological Seminary at Legon in 1973. He was commissioned as a Methodist minister upon successful completion of his training in 1977. His father, who was the head of the Methodist Church at the time of his graduation, commissioned him. Pratt's first ministry station was as a Chaplain at Fijai Secondary School in Sekondi in 1977. After his probation as a minister, he was ordained as a full minister of the Methodist Church Ghana in 1979. He spent the next three years after his probation as an assistant minister at Roundhay Methodist Church, Ladywood, Leeds, and later at Manchester and Salford Circuit. He returned to Ghana in 1982 to serve as Chaplain of Prempeh College. Subsequent ministerial postings sent him to several other churches and circuits including Kumasi, Ajumako, and Cape Coast.  Work in The Gambia  In late 1980s, Awortwi Pratt was sent to serve as a Ghanaian Superintendent minister in the newly formed district of the Methodist Church Ghana in The Gambia. He served as Synod Secretary of the Gambia District Synod till 1994. He was eventually elected as Chairman and General Superintendent of the Methodist Mission in the country. His reign as the Head of the Gambian mission ended in 2003 when he was recalled to Ghana.

Presiding Bishop  During the Methodist Church Conference of 2014, Pratt was elected as Presiding Bishop of the church. He obtained 198 votes versus the 131 votes polled by the runner-up, Paul Boafo, the chaplain at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. He was inducted into office on 1 October 2015. He replaced Emmanuel Asante who had ended his six year term as presiding bishop. Pratt became the fourth person to occupy the position since the church begun the episcopal system in the year 2000.

Biography  Ronald Alain Janssen was born on February 6, 1971 in Boorsem, the third child in a family of four. His father was a miner and his mother was a housekeeper. From early childhood Janssen was teased at school for his lisp. His father was depressed and severe at the \\"tyrannical limit\\". At home, Ronald was terrorized by his father. This fear caused him to have insomnia, which he kept throughout his life. He allegedly tried to murder his diabetic father by injecting him with a liquid instead of insulin. His mother Hilda had a strong relationship with her son, which dated from the time that Ronald's father was brutal with the family. When Hilda decided to divorce, all four children chose to continue living with their mother. He studied at Hasselt and Leuven. In 1993, he graduated as an industrial engineer with distinction. That year he also met his future wife Natalie. In 1996, the couple moved to Genk, where Natalie found a job. After being active as a technical and production manager in a company in Genk, he turned to teaching in 1998. At Maaseik, he taught mechanics and computer science until 2000. In the middle of 2000, he moved with his wife and daughters to Loksbergen. Janssen then became a professor at Herk-De-Stad where he taught computer science, economics, technology and applied mechanics. His wife left him in 2006, leaving Janssen to live alone. While in Loksbergen, neighbours would sometimes find him walking alone at night while everyone was sleeping.  The criminal case  = Annick Van Uytsel (18) = Annick Van Uytsel, an 18-year- old Diest resident, was returning to her home alone while riding a bike on April 27 to 28, 2007. Threatening her with a knife, Janssen kidnapped her and took her to his home, where he killed Van Uytsel with a hammer, then held her head under water to make sure she did not survive. 70 police officers, 200 volunteers and a helicopter began searching for the woman. A telephone terminal was activated by Annick's GSM, and her mother called her while she was still at Janssen's, which allowed the police to work in a specific sector where 4000 men between 35 and 40 years were interviewed, but the killer still managed to slip through the cracks. Annick's body was found on May 3, 2007 in Lummel in the Albert Canal, weighted down with 14.5 kilos of stones. Her bike, partially repainted by Janssen to confuse the police, was found months later in Leuven. = Shana Appeltans (18) and Kevin Paulus (22) = On the night of Saturday, January 2, 2010, Janssen met his neighbour Shana Appeltans and her boyfriend Kevin Paulus, who were returning from a night out at a coffee shop in the area. He fetched a weapon and a flammable product, then rang the couple's doorbell. Under the threat of a gun, Janssen forced them to board Kevin's Opel Corsa. While Kevin was driving, Janssen sat next to him and Shana was in the back. He told Kevin to stop near a path, where he shot both of them several times. Back home, he burned his blood-covered clothes in the stove and scattered the ashes in a ditch, then threw his weapon in the Demer. At 2:43, firefighters were called for a car on fire. The autopsy on the couple's bodies proved that they were murdered. Arrested by the police two days later on Tuesday, January 4, 2010, Janssen confessed to the crime the same evening. He also admitted to raping Shana, but later recanted that statement. = Rapes = Ronald Janssen admitted to committing three rapes while studying in Leuven, but did not provide any evidence and said he no longer remembered the names or dates. He admitted to a total of 5 rapes, but he is suspected of 20. The acts were committed between 2001 and 2010, with Janssen threatening his victims with a knife.  Trial  Ronald Janssen's trial began on Tuesday, September 20, 2011, in Limbourg. The trial was chaired by Michel Jordens, assisted by Herline Wilmots and Niels Bollen. The prosecutor was Patrick Boyen. Janssen was defended by Zvonimir Miskovic, while Jef Vermassen represented Van Uytsel's parents. In his indictment, Advocate General Patrick Boyer asked for the maximum sentence by saying: \\"I will make sure that you stay in prison until your last breath. You are a psychopath, a rapist, torturer and serial killer.\\" One month after the start of the trial, the court jury found Ronald Janssen guilty on charges without mitigating circumstances, that is of three murders, kidnapping and rape with torture. On Friday, October 21, 2011, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. During his second trial, which began on Monday, September 10, 2012 in the Limburg Criminal Court in Hasselt, he was convicted of a dozen rapes with violence, sexual assault with a weapon, several attempted murders and acts of torture and barbarities. But given his life imprisonment sentence on October 21, 2011, the second verdict did not give Janssen any additional prison time.

During this time, the prevailing theory was that mental illness was psychological, not physiological. He was the first person to search for a biochemical basis for mania, by injecting adrenalectomized animals with the blood of manic patients. In April 1944, Baird's article Biochemical Component of the Manic-Depressive Psychosis was published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease. These experiments predated John Cade's experiments in Australia in 1948, which led to the discovery of lithium as an effective treatment for mental illness. Baird's research was halted many times due to his own manic episodes and the work was never completed. During his incarceration in Westborough State Hospital and Baldpate Hospital, Baird wrote a manuscript of his experiences, titled ‚ÄúEchoes from a Dungeon Cell‚Äù, detailing the harsh treatment of mental patients at that time.[1 In 2015, his research work and the manuscript he wrote while institutionalised were published in a book, He Wanted The Moon: The Madness and Medical Genius of Dr. Perry Baird and His Daughter‚Äôs Quest to Know Him, written by his daughter, Mimi Baird. Plan B Entertainment has optioned the book for a film and Tony Kushner is writing the screenplay.  Education  In June, 1924 Baird graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Texas in just three years and went on to attend Harvard Medical School. While in medical school, he published several articles in the American Journal of Physiology (see below) and in June 1928 graduated magna cum laude with the highest academic honors available.  Life, research and manic depression  On Christmas Day, 1931, Baird married Margaretta Stewart Gibbons in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. The two went on to have two daughters: Mary Stewart (Mimi), born in 1938, and Catherine Cossart in 1940. Baird‚Äôs first hospitalization for a manic episode occurred in 1932, resulting in the rescinding of a planned appointment to chairman of dermatology at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Despite the setback, Baird continued his research and studies, publishing in medical journals and later opening his private practice in dermatology in 1934. As a graduate assistant in research at the Massachusetts General Hospital, he began experiments exploring the concept that individuals who are in a state of mania exhibit a biochemical imbalance. After experiencing another manic episode, Baird was admitted to McLean Hospital in the fall of 1934 and stepped away from his research. But in 1940, he resumed, beginning a correspondence with Massachusetts General Hospital‚Äôs Dr. Walter B. Cannon and drafting an article on the biochemical component of mania. In late 1943, The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disorders accepted Baird‚Äôs article: ‚ÄúBiochemical Component of the Manic-Depressive Psychosis.‚Äù Upon its 1944 publication, Baird was being held at Westborough State Hospital as a psychiatric patient. After multiple hospitalizations, the Massachusetts Board of Registration rescinded Baird‚Äôs medical license in 1944, and Baird and his wife divorced later the same year. His hospitalizations continued in Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Danvers State Hospital, Butler Hospital, and finally Galveston State Psychopathic Hospital. In December 1949, Baird received a pre-frontal bilateral lobotomy. A few years later, in 1951, he attended his medical school reunion in Boston and saw his daughters for the last time. After moving to Detroit in 1959 to work at a hospital emergency room, Baird died from a postoperative seizure.

Nacrelli is an American politician who served as a Republican mayor of Chester, Pennsylvania from 1968 to 1979. Nacrelli was convicted on federal bribery and racketeering charges related to his activities as mayor and served two years in prison. Career Nacrelli was appointed to the Chester City Council in 1966 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Garry E. Boden. He was elected for a two year term on the council in 1967. Nacrelli was elected mayor of Chester in 1968 and served until 1979. Corruption Nacrelli was affiliated with an illegal numbers gambling operation of the Miller-Fontaine syndicate. Nacrelli directed the Chester Police Department to arrest numbers operators who tried to compete with the Miller-Fontaine operation. The corrupt political system set up by Nacrelli stretched beyond Chester and into Delaware County. Nacrelli was convicted of racketeering and income tax evasion for accepting $22,000 in bribes associated with the illegal gambling operation. He served two years in federal prison and returned to Chester in March 1982. A few months after his release from prison, Nacrelli began working as a sales representative for JP Amusement, an illegal video poker machine business operated by Willie Smith, a known loan shark and narcotics financier and Joseph and James Iacona - the brothers of Gary Iacona, who was indicted for his involvement in the Philadelphia crime family capo Santo Idone. According to testimony at the 1989 Pennsylvania Crime Commission, Nacrelli would intimidate tavern owners to remove competitive video poker machines from their establishments and replace them with JP Amusement machines. Nacrelli continued to play a role in local politics and Chester city government after his release from prison. He retained influence in the control of patronage matters and the official affairs of the Chester City Council and the Chester School District. Nacrelli was hired by Westinghouse to influence Delaware County politicians into supporting the development of the Westinghouse trash incinerator in Chester despite the objections of Willie Mae James Leake, the mayor at the time.

He was an early disciple of Ren√© Leibowitz, a teacher and composer who maintained a strict adherence to the dodecaphonic musical theories of Arnold Schoenberg. Casanova later abandoned most of them in favour of a more classical style of composition. His published works, composed between 1944 and 1993, include orchestral, chamber and choral music, operas and songs. Life and career Casanova was born in Paris, and studied law there, while at the same time studying music with Georges Dandelot at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris. In 1944 he became the first French pupil of Ren√© Leibowitz,Bosseur, Jean-Yves \\"Casanova, Andr√©\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 2001, retrieved 10 May 2018 with whom he studied theory and composition. Leibowitz introduced him to dodecaphonic and serial composition. Together with other Leibowitz pupils, Serge Nigg, Antoine Duhamel and Jean Prodromid√®s, he gave the first performance of Leibowitz's Explications des Metaphors, Op. 15, in Paris in 1948.Martini, p. 443Maguire, Jan. Rene Leibowitz (II): The Music, Tempo, New Series, No. 132 (March 1980), pp. 2-10 Thereafter, according to the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Casanova's concern was \\"to ally a romantic spirit with modernity of style\\". in the mid-1950s he abandoned dodecaphony, although he retained some of its chromatic elements for harmonic purposes. After his avant-garde period, Casanova returned to what Grove calls \\"a more classical conception of both style and form\\". In 1959 his Concertino, for piano and chamber orchestra, was performed as a French contribution at the 33rd annual music festival of the International Society for Contemporary Music. In 1960 he received an award from the Queen Marie Jos√© Music Foundation for his Cavalier seul, a chamber cantata for baritone and string quartet (later revised for voice and string orchestra), dedicated to Hans Werner Henze.\\" Cavalier seul, Op. 15\\", Biblioth√®que nationale de France, retrieved 10 May 2018 In the late 1940s there had been some hostility between adherents of Leibowitz and those of the teacher and composer Olivier Messiaen,Fallon, Robert. \\"Birds, Beasts, and Bombs in Messiaen's Cold War Mass\\", The Journal of Musicology, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Spring 2009), p. 185 but so far as Casanova was concerned any breach had healed sufficiently during the 1950s for Messiaen's partner Yvonne Loriod to play the solo part at the premiere of Casanova's piano concertino in 1959.\\"Concertino ‚Äì Piano, orchestre de chambre, Op. 8\\" Biblioth√®que nationale de France, retrieved 10 May 2018 He developed an interest in German Romantic literature and with Nietzsche's philosophy, which is reflected in his work.

It was originally built as a single-family home in 1853. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. History Henry DeWitt Bennet was the postmaster of Ann Arbor during most of the 1850s. In about 1853, Bennett had this house built. Bennett was later the secretary and steward of the University of Michigan In 1886 Bennet retired and moved to California, selling his house to a neighbor. The neighbor rented it out for a few years, and in 1890 sold the house to Reuben and Pauline Kempf. Both Reuben and Pauline Kempf were musicians, and their home turned into a local center for the musical arts. The Kempfs hosted musical figures such as Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Victor Herbert, and Ernestine Schumann-Heink. The Kempfs lived in the house until their deaths: Reuben's in 1945 and Pauline's in 1953. In 1953, Mr. and Mrs. Earl V. Parker purchased the house. In 1969, Earl Parker died and the city of Ann Arbor acquired the house. The city turned the house into a historic museum. The house has been restored, and includes a music studio that looks as it did when the Kempfs were first giving lessons. The house is open for tours weekly. Description The Bennett House is a frame, 1-1/2 story, temple style Greek Revival house sitting on a brick foundation. The facade has four massive, squared Doric columns, along with three frieze windows and a graceful tympaneum. The main section of the house measures 54 feet by 23 feet. A small, two-room addition holding the kitchen, built in the 1890s, is attached to the rear. The house currently has six rooms and bath on the first floor, and three bedrooms and 1-1/2 baths on the second.

The experiments were conducted at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University between 1957 and 1964 by the Scottish psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron and funded by the CIA as part of Project MKUltra, which lasted until 1973 and was only revealed to the public in 1975. The patients of this experiment, who were mainly diagnosed with depression or schizophrenia expected positive changes from Cameron's treatment. However, these patients suffered severely under conditions that are not in accordance with the human rights. Not only the patients but also their families show long lasting effects on their mental health. Some of these symptoms include retrograde amnesia as well as impairments in every day life abilities such as self-care. To this day, the topic of the experiments of Montreal has been kept in the dark by the CIA, who actively prevent information about these experiments from being leaked to the public, whether that be through destruction of files or signing non-disclosure agreements.  Donald Ewen Cameron  Donald Ewen Cameron, circa 1967 Donald Ewen Cameron was the key figure in the Montreal experiments. Cameron was born on December 24, 1901 in Scotland and graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1924. In 1929 he moved to Canada where he worked in the Brandon Mental Hospital in Manitoba as the physician in charge. In 1938 he received his diploma in psychiatry and became professor of neurology, psychiatry at University at Albany and began his research on sensory deprivation and memory. In 1953 he developed his theory of ‚Äúpsychic driving‚Äù to cure schizophrenia which he later used on his patients under the Project MKUltra, with the codename ‚ÄúSubproject 68‚Äù for which he was recruited by the CIA in 1957. He was paid $69,000 through the front company ‚ÄúSociety for the Investigation of Human Ecology‚Äù from 1957 to 1964 to carry out these experiments, as well as receiving \\"more than $500,000 between 1950 and 1965\\" from the federal government. He suddenly left the project four years before the end of his contract. In 1961 he became president of the World Psychiatric Association after he had already been the president of both the American Psychiatric Association as well as the Canadian Psychiatric Association. In 1967 he died of a heart attack.  Treatment  With the goal of inducing lifelong changes in humans, Cameron used different methods of depatterning and repatterning the brain. The procedures included psychic driving, drug-induced sleep, intensive electroconvulsive therapy, sensory deprivation and the administration of neuroleptic Thorazine. Drug-Induced Sleep Cameron used doses of thorazine to put patients into an artificial coma. The drug-induced sleep, which took place in the ‚Äúsleep room‚Äù, usually lasted from a few days up to 86 days; longer than expected by the patients. Cameron often combined the sleep periods with injections of hallucinogenic drugs (e.g. LSD), as well as administration of electroshocks and the playing of pre-recorded messages into patients' ears. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) Electroconvulsive Therapy Electroconvulsive Therapy (also called electroshock therapy) is a procedure used to treat psychological disorders like Treatment-resistant depression. Another way of depatterning the brain was intensive electroconvulsive therapy (electroshock therapy). Usually, 2 to 3 daily sessions were ordered, consisting of six 150-Volt shocks that lasted one second. After 30-40 daily sessions, Cameron progressively reduced the sessions and finished the treatment after a two-year follow up program with one session per month. Sensory Deprivation Inspired by Donald Hebb's experiment on sensory deprivation and human cognition, Cameron included these techniques in his treatment program. Patients were deprived of their senses by covering ears, eyes and/or skin. Furthermore, patients were given little food, water and oxygen, and instead injected with drugs (LSD, curare) to keep them in a paralyzed state. Psychic Driving In order to repattern the brain, patients had to listen to specific recordings of Cameron repeatedly. This process took place for up to 16 hours a day, and over the whole period messages could be repeated up to half a million times altogether. For the first ten days, recordings contained personal, negative messages, which were followed by ten days of positive messages. Anxiety that would emerge in patients was countered with heavy doses of sedating drugs such as Sodium Amytal and Largactil.  Patients  It is unknown how many people participated in the Montreal Experiments exactly, but over 300 people applied for compensation in 1992 with the Canadian Government. The participants of the experiment mainly had mental health issues like depression and schizophrenia, and were hoping to get treated for these illnesses by Donald Ewen Cameron. None of them had given informed consent to the procedures, or were aware of the experiments being conducted. This was a gross violation of the Nuremberg Code, a code of ethics set up after World War II. Children and adults from many social backgrounds were treated, most of them for up to three years. Participants often suffered from retrograde amnesia for the rest of their lives and had to relearn most skills they had. Many were in a childlike state and even had to be potty- trained. Family described them as even more emotionally unstable as before and some of them were unable to live a normal life afterwards. One such patient was Jean Steel, whose daughter said that she never returned to be the same woman ever again. Jean would sit alone in the dark, write codes on the walls, and according to her daughter, \\"her emotions were stripped. It took away her soul.\\"  Aftermath  Project MKUltra officially ended in 1973, around the time that the Watergate scandal broke, and CIA director of the time Richard Helms ordered the destruction of all documents pertaining to the experimentation. It wasn't until 1975 that the general public were informed about the extent of CIA meddling, largely due to the involvement of the Church Committee, which was tasked with the investigation of ‚Äúthe extent, if any, to which illegal, improper, or unethical activities were engaged in by any agency of the Federal Government,\\" a task evidently hindered by the destruction of the documents. During the 1977 Senate Hearing on MKUltra, Senator Edward ‚ÄúTed‚Äù Kennedy called for the release of all documents pertaining to MKUltra, saying ‚Äúthe best way to put this period behind us, obviously, is to have the full information‚Ä¶‚Äù The Senate Hearing also allowed the CIA Director of the time, Stansfield Turner, to give his prepared statement and to elaborate on the discovery of seven boxes of information related to Project MKUltra, most of which turned out to consist of \\"approvals for advance of funds, vouchers, accountings, and the like  most of which are not very informative as to the nature of the activities that were undertaken.\\" This made it very difficult to judge the extent of CIA involvement with the Montreal Experiments. More information was revealed in the Canadian CBC documentary series ‚ÄúThe Fifth Estate‚Äù. In 1980, they released a first episode about Project MKUltra, which not only held the testimony of two Canadian patients who'd undergone the treatment speaking out for the first time, but also the revelation that Ottawa had aided to suppress information that CIA officials had apologised to the Canadian government following the initial revelation of the experimentation. The second episode, released in 2017, focuses on the present-day struggle of the victims to receive compensation, the hindrances made to prevent them from speaking out about their experiences, and the efforts of the CIA and Canadian government to keep their involvement hidden. Mentioned in particular are a 1988 class action settlement made by the victims against the CIA, which they won, receiving 67,000 US dollars each, and a 1992 compensation from the Canadian government, in which 77 individuals received 100,000 US dollars each, but signed away their right to sue the government or the hospital. This compensation did not extend to 250 other victims, denied for not being \\"tortured enough, applied too late or because they couldn't produce medical records.\\" To this day, neither the Canadian government nor the CIA have issued formal apologies for their involvement and funding of Project MKUltra or the Montreal experiments. In 2017, the Canadian government reached an out-of-court settlement with the daughter of one of the patients, paying 100,000 US dollars in exchange for dropping the legal case, and signing a non-disclosure agreement which would prevent her from talking about the settlement.  Criticism  There is no clear evidence of what really happened in the Montreal Experiments. None of Cameron's personal files concerning his experiments survived. Other documents which would verify the Montreal Experiments either no longer exist or are still classified. Most of the information on the experiments is rooted in reports of patients, especially their journals or court reports.

The city has a long history of street art that was first tied to various subcultures in the 1970s and 1980s. During the Bosnian war political and anti-war street art was one of the main artistic focal points of the besieged city. Today, Sarajevo is a European center for street art and hosts two international festivals dedicated to the art form. History Sarajevo war-time guerrilla art shown in The Hunting Party Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, much of the city's youth was influenced by the graffiti of New York, which subsequently became popular in Sarajevo's inner suburbs, and along the suburban railway and tram lines. With the arrival of the Punk and Mod subcultures to the Former Yugoslavia, as well as the rise of the New Primitives artistic movement,\\"Smisao nadrealizma dr. Neleta Karajliƒáa\\", Neboj≈°a Grujiƒçiƒá & Jovana Gligorijeviƒá, Vreme issue #1144, Belgrade, 6 December 2012, p.52 street art became extremely prevalent in the city. Even though street art was present in Sarajevo while Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of Yugoslavia, it only truly became prevalent with the start of the Bosnian war in 1992, when the city came under siege. Numerous art collectives tied to the Sarajevo Academy of Fine Arts, the Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo and formal artistic institutions such as Collegium Artisticum used street art to call attention to what was happening in the country. Since the war, the city has become a hotbed for street art, with the local government endorsing the creation of various street art quarters and having a lenient attitude towards this form of artistic expression. Styles =Guerrilla art= Street Art by Kerim Mu≈°anoviƒá Guerrilla art is the most common form of street art found in Sarajevo. Guerrilla artists increasingly seem to be moving towards a philosophy of painting a continuous work of art, adding to it over time as less developed elements of the piece are erased by graffiti cleaning efforts or in the battle for space. The most important development in the street art movement and the reason for its 'guerrilla' tag is the adoption of guerrilla marketing techniques over traditional artistic methods. The use of guerrilla marketing methods to create ‚Äòartistic publicity‚Äô has seen the evolution away from artists as creative individuals and towards artists as brands. This style of street art was first adopted by Sarajevan street artists during the Siege. =Street installations= Sarajevo Red Line street installation Street installations have become a regular form of artistic expression in Sarajevo since the war. The most well-known was the Sarajevo Red Line, held on April 6, 2012 in the Mar≈°al Tito street and it consisted of a large chair installation, street exhibition of war posters and a concert.{{cite web url=http://www.federalna.ba/bhs/vijest/19159/11541-crvena- stolica-u-znak-sjecanja-na-ubijene/  publisher=Federal Television  title=Sarajevo Red Line  lang=Bosnian  accessdate=April 4, 2012 =Ultras street art= The Ultras subculture is a type of football fan renowned for ultra-fanatical support. The subculture is predominantly tied to association football, with members following association football teams. Sarajevo's two major football clubs, FK Sarajevo and FK ≈Ωeljezniƒçar both have organized Ultras groups, with the former being supported by Horde Zla and the latter being supported by Manijaci. Both groups have partaken in the creation of numerous examples in of street art that can be found across the city. =War memorials= Large colourful murals and images decorate some of the derelict and crumbling walls of Sarajevo's suburbs, acting to commemorate victims of the war or to distract people from the unrepaired damage. Sarajevo Rose A Sarajevo Rose is a concrete scar caused by a mortar shell's explosion that was later filled with red resin. Mortar rounds landing on concrete create a unique fragmentation pattern that looks almost floral in arrangement. Because Sarajevo was a site of intense urban warfare and suffered thousands of shell explosions during the Siege of Sarajevo, the marked concrete patterns are a unique feature to the city. Throughout the city, explosion marks have been filled with red resin to mark where mortar explosions resulted in one or more deaths. Festivals Sarajevo Olympics bobsled Sarajevo hosts two international festivals dedicated to street art. The Sarajevo Street Art Festival is held in July of every year and lasts for three days. Each year's edition is made up of numerous street performances, the creation of a new street art quarter in the city, concerts, the painting of large murals and the showcasing of other creative art forms. Beton Fest is an international 3D street art festival that is held in July of every year and lasts for five days. It is the only 3D street art festival in Southeastern Europe and has hosted many renowned street artists such as Vera Bugatti, Giovanna la Pietra, Tony Cuboliquido, Manuel Bastante and others. Apart from the two major street art festivals, Sarajevo also hosts Pop-Up! Sarajevo and the Pop Art Festival which organize street art conferences and workshops.

The events of the siege are described in the second book of the Miracles of Saint Demetrius. Background In the reign of Justinian I (), Slavic tribes (Sclaveni) had already appeared on the Danube frontier of the Byzantine Empire. Over the next few decades, they raided into Thrace and Illyricum, while at times serving as mercenaries in the Byzantine army. From the 560s, the Slav communities came under the control of the newly established Avar Khaganate. Raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement, especially as the Avars were able to capture fortified cities, leading to loss of imperial control over the surrounding areas. While the Byzantines were preoccupied in the East against the Persians, the 580s saw ever deeper and more destructive raids in the Balkans, even into southern Greece. The same period saw the start of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkan hinterland. After making peace with Persia, Emperor Maurice was able to launch a series of counterattacks that drove the Avars and their Slavic allies back, but the respite was short-lived: following the usurpation of Phocas in 602, and the start of another, and even more catastrophic, war with Persia, the Balkans were left nearly defenseless, and the Danube frontier collapsed once more, overrun by the Avars and Slavic tribes, who settled across the region. By the 610s, the city of Thessalonica was surrounded by large Slavic settlements, being reduced to itself within its wall, according to historian John Van Antwerp Fine, to \\"virtually a Roman island in a Slavic sea\\". The first book of the Miracles of Saint Demetrius records the attempts by the Slavs to capture the city in that time, first an unsuccessful attack by the Slavic leader Chatzon in , followed by an unsuccessful siege by the Avars and Slavs in 617. By the middle of the 7th century, more cohesive Slavic coalitions (Sclaviniae) had been established in the former Roman Balkans. The only imperial reaction came in 658, when Emperor Constans II campaigned in Thrace, brought many Sclaviniae under imperial control, and relocated many Slavs to Asia Minor.  Immediate cause of the siege  Cathedral of St. Demetrius in Thessalonica, depicting the saint with the city's archbishop (left) and the eparch (right) The second book of the Miracles of Saint Demetrius names Perboundos, the \\"king of the Rhynchinoi\\", as a powerful ruler, who was sufficiently assimilated to be able to speak Greek, had relations with Thessalonica to the point of maintaining a residence there, and even dressed in the Byzantine style. According to the Miracles, the peace existing between the Slavs and the Byzantines ended when the‚Äîunnamed‚ÄîByzantine eparch of Thessalonica was informed that Perboundos planned to move against the city. The eparch reported this to the Byzantine emperor, who ordered his arrest. After informing the city elders, the eparch had Perboundos arrested during his stay in the city, put in irons and sent to the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. The Rhynchinoi, along with a Slavic tribe living in the neighbouring Strymon valley, the Strymonitai, were greatly upset by Perboundos' arrest. At their request, a joint delegation including Thessalonian envoys went to Constantinople to intercede on his behalf‚Äîa unique event, according to Byzantinist Paul Lemerle, that illustrates the surprisingly close and amicable relationship between the Byzantine city and its \\"barbarian\\" neighbours. The phrasing of the Miracles makes clear that Perboundos was guilty of some transgression, since the embassy was sent to request clemency but not exoneration. The emperor, who was in the midst of extensive preparations for a war with the Arabs, promised to set Perboundos free once the war was over. The envoys were apparently satisfied with this, and returned home; the agitation among the Slavs subsided for the moment. Subsequent events proved the eparch's suspicions well-founded. Perboundos managed to escape with the aid of an imperial translator charged with affairs concerning the Slavic tribes. A large-scale manhunt was launched against Perboundos, and fears of an imminent Slavic move on Thessalonica led the emperor to send a swift dromon to warn the city and instruct its leaders to take precautions and stockpile food in case of a siege. After forty days Perboundos was found hiding on the translator's estate near Bizye. The translator was executed, but Perboundos was returned to confinement in Constantinople, as before. After another failed attempt to escape, he publicly proclaimed his intention of raising all the Slavic tribes in revolt and seizing Thessalonica. Following his confession, he was executed.  Slavic uprising and siege  On receiving news of Perboundos' execution, the Rhynchinoi rose in revolt,The time between the execution and the uprising is unknown, but may have been several months. soon joined by the Strymonitai and another neighbouring tribe, the Sagoudatai. Many other Slavic tribes, however, did not join the revolt, and some, like the Belegezitai, proved willing to assist the Roman side. =Blockade and famine in Thessalonica= This Slavic league blockaded Thessalonica by land and raided its environs, with each tribe being assigned a specific area: the Strymonitai attacked from the east and north, the Rhynchinoi from the south, and the Sagoudatai from the west. Three or four raids were launched each day, both on land and at sea, for two years; all livestock was carried off, agriculture ceased, and maritime traffic was stopped. Anyone who ventured from the city walls was likely to be killed or captured. The historian Florin Curta comments that the Slavs \\"appear as better organized than in any of the preceding sieges, with an army of special units of archers and warriors armed with slings, spears, shields, and swords\\". The city could expect little assistance from the emperor, who in the face of the Arab threat could not spare any troops. The situation was made worse by the city's authorities, who allowed the grain hoarded in the granaries, following the emperor's instructions, to be sold to foreign ships in the harbour, at a rate of a nomisma for seven modii, just one day before the start of the blockade. The anonymous author of the Miracles is highly critical of the commercial and civic elites for their greed and short-sightedness, which led to the rapid onset of famine inside the city. Exacerbated by a lack of water, the famine caused great suffering among the inhabitants, described at length in the text of the Miracles. The situation became so bad that many Thessalonians defected to the besiegers, who in turn, fearful of so many Byzantines among them sold them on as slaves to other Slavic tribes of the Balkan interior; and only after some of these slaves escaped, bringing word of their sufferings to Thessalonica, did the defections cease. In the same context, but in passing, the author mentions the betrayal of a part of the Slavs to the north of the city, who, while appearing to trade with the city, slaughtered \\"the flower of our most valorous fellow citizens\\". The exact meaning of this passage is unclear; it may indicate a failed military operation by the besieged, or the massacre of a group of defectors who tried to return to the city, but it also indicates that at least a part of the besiegers (probably, based on their location, belonging to the Strymonitai) maintained relations with the city, and that the blockade was not entirely impenetrable. =Arrival of the Byzantine squadron and the great Slavic assault= city wall of Thessalonica Some relief was provided by the arrival of a squadron of ten armed transports, all that the emperor could spare, as he was engaged \\"in the other war\\" with the Arabs. However, according to the author of the Miracles, the sailors took advantage of the Thessalonians, and sold them the grain they had brought at highly inflated prices, while the authorities used them as manpower to seek out any hidden caches of grain in the city. The new arrivals were not sufficient to prevent the Slavs from operating freely in the city's environs; anyone who ventured outside the city walls, by land or sea, seeking food was in danger of attack. As a result, an assembly of the citizens and the local council decided to send the ten vessels, along with whatever watercraft could be found in the city, manned by the most vigorous citizens, to obtain food from the Belegezitai, who were living at the shores of the Pagasetic Gulf in Thessaly. Their absence was noted and the Slavs decided to exploit the absence of so many defenders to assault the city. They asked the assistance of the Drougoubitai, a large tribe, or confederation of tribes, living northwest of Thessalonica, who possessed the knowledge of making siege engines. The extent of the participation of the Drougoubitai in the siege is unclear; according to Lemerle, they likely provided only the engines and perhaps their crews. Thus reinforced, the Slavs launched their decisive attack on 25 July \\"of the fifth indiction\\" (677). According to the account of the Miracles, the first miraculous intervention of Saint Demetrius caused the Strymonitai to halt and turn back once they were three miles from the city walls; the reasons for this defection are unknown, but it effectively left only the Rhynchinoi and the Sagoudatai to carry the brunt of the fighting. Due to the hagiographic nature of the Miracles, and the use of common literary topoi, gleaning details about the fighting from the account is difficult; certainly the siege engines provided by the Drougoubitai are not mentioned as playing any particular role in the events. Over three days, from 25 until 27 July, the Slavs launched attacks on the city walls but were repelled by the defenders, with the aid, according to the Miracles, of Saint Demetrius himself, who intervened numerous times to repel the assaults. Most notably he is recorded as appearing in person, on foot and bearing a cudgel, to repel an attack by the Drougoubitai against a postern at a place called Arktos‚Äîan event which some modern commentators have interpreted as indicating that the Slavs penetrated into the city. On the evening of the 27th, the Slavs abandoned the assault and withdrew, taking their fallen with them, but abandoning the siege engines, which were taken by the Thessalonians into the city. A few days later, the expedition sent to Thessaly returned, laden with wheat and dried vegetables. =Imperial expedition and end of the blockade= Despite the failure of the assault and the successful replenishment of the city's food supply, the Slavs continued with their blockade and raids, setting up ambushes around the city, but their pressure on the city itself relaxed somewhat. Their attention now shifted to the sea, and launched raids against seaborne merchant traffic, using not only the customary primitive monoxyla, but actual ships, capable of sailing in the high seas. With these they raided across the northern Aegean, even penetrating the Dardanelles and reaching the Prokonnesos in the Sea of Marmara. This lasted until the emperor, free from other concerns, ordered his army to advance against the Slavs (only the Strymonitai are mentioned by name henceforth) through Thrace. Lemerle remarks on the surprising absence of similar orders to the navy, given the recent piratical activity of the Slavs, but considers that the expedition was aimed at resolving the problem at its root, striking at the habitats of the tribes responsible. The Strymonitai, who received news of the emperor's intentions, had enough time to prepare their defence, occupying passes and other strategic positions and calling upon other tribes for aid. Nevertheless they were decisively defeated by the imperial troops and forced to flee; even the settlements close to Thessalonica were abandoned, as the Slavs sought refuge towards the interior. The famished Thessalonians, including unarmed women and children, took the opportunity of pillaging the nearby Slavic settlements for food. The emperor also sent a grain fleet under strong escort by warships, carrying 60,000 measures of wheat for the city, in what Lemerle considers an eloquent testament of renewed ability of the Byzantine central government to intervene decisively in the Balkans after the Arab danger had passed. Following this, the Slavs requested peace negotiations, the outcome of which is not mentioned.  Questions of chronology  Emperor Constantine IV and his retinue, mosaic in the basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna The Miracles mention no specific date other than the \\"fifth indiction\\", leading to speculation by modern scholars as to the timing of these events. Some scholars followed the proposal of the nineteenth-century Austrian historian T. L. Tafel, who placed the events in 634, but the then reigning emperor, Heraclius () was not in Constantinople, nor had the conflict with the Arabs begun. H√©l√®ne Antoniades-Bibicou and Halina Evert-Kappesova suggested a different reconstruction, with the arrest of Perboundos occurring in 644, followed by the two-year siege of Thessalonica, with the great Slavic assault on the \\"fifth indiction\\" in 647, followed by an imperial campaign against the Strymonitai in 648/649. Charles Diehl and others identified the latter with Constans II's campaign in 657‚Äì658; Henri Gr√©goire suggested 692 as the date of the general assault, but the Byzantines and Arabs were at peace in the years prior to then. Another theory, supported by Francis Dvornik and Konstantin Jireƒçek among others, identified the campaign at the end of the siege with the expedition launched by Justinian II () in 687/688, when the emperor led in person a campaign through Thrace and Macedonia up to Thessalonica, thus restoring the overland connection between the latter and Constantinople. This would place the siege in the years 685‚Äì687, but once again, these years were a period of peace with the Arabs. The chronology accepted today by most scholars is that established by Paul Lemerle in his critical edition of the Miracles, which relies on a number of factors: the great time elapsed since the previous Slavic sieges, as inferred from the narrative, points to an exclusion of earlier dates; the emperor reigning during the siege was the same as that reigning when the account was compiled, which excludes Justinian II, since his arrival in person in Thessalonica would have been mentioned by the author; and the emperor's preoccupation with a conflict with the Arabs, which removes 662, when the Arabs were in peace with Byzantium due to the First Fitna. This leaves 676/677, when the Byzantines under Constantine IV () were confronted with the huge attack launched by the Umayyad Caliphate in 671/672, that culminated in the Siege of Constantinople in 674‚Äì678, as the only \\"fifth indiction\\" that matches all the facts described in the source. The reconstructed chronology that Lemerle suggested places the arrest and execution of Perboundos sometime in early 676, with the Slavic alliance starting the siege in summer 676 and culminating in the great assault against Thessalonica in July 677. The imperial expedition against the Strymonitai, and the lifting of the siege, took place in summer 678, following the destruction of the Arab fleet and the end of the Arab threat to Constantinople. The Greek scholar Andreas Stratos proposes an even longer time-frame, with the Perboundos affair taking place sometime in 672‚Äì674, his execution taking place in 674/675, just as the Arab siege began in earnest, followed by the start of the Slavic attacks on Thessalonica in 675. In the rest, he too follows Lemerle's chronology.

It was founded in 1973 thanks to the \\"Centro Iniziativa Giovanile (C.I.G.)\\" with the aim to document peasant life and culture of the mountain region of the Valtellina. The \\"Centro Iniziativa Giovanile\\" run the museum until the end of the year 2017, since then the municipality of Tirano took responsibility for the continuation and development of the museum.  Museum Collection  The collection of the Museo Etnografico Tiranese is located since 1990 in the Casa del Penitenziere (Penitent's House), an 18th-century Palazzo nearby the Basilica Madonna di Tirano. Until then it was housed in the ground floor of the Palazzo San Michele, located as well at the square of the basilica. The collection was moved to its new location as a result of the Valtellina flood disaster of the summer of 1987. The municipality of Tirano renewed and adapted therefore the complete building. On a historical point of view the location at the Piazza della Basilica is a very strategical one because in the year of 1514 the town of Tirano was allowed to host on the Piazza an annual trade-fair which became quite important during the reign of the Three Leagues in Valtellina. This way the square of the basilica became notable for both, the religious element of the pilgrimage and the economic element of the trade- fair. Furthermore a painting from the local painter Antonio Caimi sketches a typical but idealized day at this fair-trade in the middle of the 19th century. The central interests of the museum-collection are objects and devices that reflect the historical peasant life in the Valtellina. Until now the Museo Etnografico Tiranese has collected more than 14.000 objects, of which a big part is exposed in the exhibition halls of the museum. The exhibition area is extended over three floor levels and a cellar room, showing a cross-section of the historic working and rural living environment of the Valtellina. On the ground level the workshop of a cartwright and cooper is arranged with traditional equipment for wood- and ironwork which were used for the construction and repair of carts and barrels. In the first floor the production of traditional textile, mainly based on natural fibres such as linen and hemp, is displayed. Next to a traditional hand loom even instruments of producing woollen fibres, such as reels, spindles and carding-machines are exposed. Another room on the first floor is referring to the nearby Sanctuary of Madonna di Tirano, the dominant religious element of the city since the beginning of the 16th century. Notable here are the vestments donated to the Basilica in 1636 by Cardinal Duke Richelieu, french clergymen and statesman at the same time. The donation is to consider as a political act with the aim to strengthen the followers of the french party in the Valtellina during the conflicts of the B√ºndner Wirren, part of the larger Thirty Years War. On the second floor of the museum a \\"st√ºa\\", a room-type in the alpine range typical for its wood-panelled ceiling and walls, has been organized as a living- and bedroom. Another room gives place to the reconstruction of the basic features of a local kitchen. Major section on this floor is the show-room with tools of the daily use of peasant activity. The items are grouped to different topics such as the cheese dairy, the slaughtering, the forest work or the work in the terraced vineyards of the Valtellina. The cellar houses in particular two historic wine presses made of wood. The big one was typical after the period of the use of the big lever supported press and before the use of the more stable and more compact iron screw-press. The small wine press was used to squeeze the grapes for the Sforzato (\\"sfurzat\\"), a raisin wine traditionally produced in the Valtellina. Luggage of emigrants In the year of 1993 the Museo Etnografico Tiranese has also been associated with the Centro Provinciale di documentazione sull'emigrazione, which was founded to study the Italian migration movement with a focus on the emigration from the province of Sondrio. Several books have been published to this topic, especially on the issue of emigrants in Australia. Therefore the collections of the museum contain more than 1.600 letters from Australia in originals and in copy which describe the new life of the emigrants, and generally are a source for communication structures between the new and the old home land. In addition to the exhibition-collection, there is also a photo- and postcard-collection, a tape-library, a film-library, a print-collection and an archive of historical documents. The collection of historical photos and postcards now contains more than 4.000 objects and provides, together with a collection of historical prints, outstanding material for studies of the changing in the cultural landscape and settlement of the Valtellina.

Built in 1857 in Sunderland, England, she was wrecked near the northern tip of Queensland, Australia, in 1883.  History  The Newcastle launched in 1857, 1275 tons, was built by W. Pile junior at Sunderland for Richard Green's London to India service. The National Maritime Museum in Greenwich has a bill of sale for the transaction (NMM MS GRN 14). She was designed by the noted naval architect Bernard Waymouth (1824‚Äì1890). Waymouth went on to design the Leander (1867) and the Thermopylae (1868). He also served as Lloyd's Register's senior surveyor for London. The Newcastle was drawn by the artist William Foster in 1857, and his picture was made into a lithograph that same year by Thomas Goldsworthy Dutton; she was shown flying the Green Blackwall line House flag on her main mast. Her first commander was R.D. Crawford. During a large part of the 1860s she was a troop carrier between London and Calcutta. After the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 she carried passengers to Melbourne. She served for years on the London to Australia route, carrying mail and cargo. Sailing ship Newcastle, wrecked in the Torres Strait. (Description supplied with the photograph). Sometime shortly before June 1883 when underway to Thursday Island to be hulked, she was stranded at Bushy Islet, in the Torres Strait. She was soon reported as having broken up. The wreck was sold at Thursday Island according to the Sydney Morning Herald on 21 June 1883. The Brisbane Courier of 31 July 1883 and The Queenslander of 4 August 1883 tell us that she \\"remained fast upon the reef\\". The Asteria, and Jemima, along with several lighters arrived at the wreck to recover the cargo. The salvage team employed several of the crew in the task, and the remaining members were transported to Sydney. In July 1883 the cargo was salvaged, the vessel stripped of its copper fastenings and blown up using explosives.

It is a hospital capable of super tertiary care and is the first university hospital in Northern Thailand, and the first to be located outside Bangkok. The hospital is known as 'Suandok Hospital' locally, due to its close proximity to Suan Dok Gate.  History  Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital features world-renowned physicians that utilise the latest cutting-edge medical technology and has exceptional nursing staff members that have undergone overseas training who can provide patients with top quality medical care. The hospital strives to create a serene ambience for their patients who are mostly multi-cultural and from a variety of countries. There are also translators who are onboard and can speak over 30 different languages. Thai is the main language used within the hospital. Most staff can also speak English. In 1939, a new hospital was planned to be built near Suan Dok Gate, in order to increase provision of healthcare in Chiang Mai and spread patients to other facilities as the original 'Chiang Mai Hospital' had a capacity of only 11 beds and was unsuitable for expansion. As construction was completed in 1941, there was a lack of medical personnel available, so operations were transferred from Chiang Mai City Municipality to the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and the hospital was opened on 24 June 1941 as 'Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital'. The hospital then underwent extensive expansion using financial aid from donations of local citizens and businesses, including aid from the United States government under the presidency of Harry S. Truman, as well as aid from the World Health Organisation. The funding contributed to the construction of X-ray imaging facilities, operating theaters and the pediatric ward of the hospital. The first regional medical school was then approved by the cabinet in 1956 and set up by the University of Medical Sciences (now Mahidol University) as the Faculty of Medicine Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital and teaching was done at the hospital. On 1 January 1959, operations were transferred from the MOPH to the University of Medical Sciences. Chiang Mai University was then founded in 1964 by royal decree and operations were transferred to Chiang Mai University. On 25 July 1983, the hospital was renamed 'Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital', in honour of King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

The dam burst amid heavy rains on 9 May 2018, killing at least 48 people. Background The Milmet dam was one of five earthen embankment dams belonging to Mansukul Patel on the private property of his commercial rose farm and business, Solai Roses. The other dams were known as Main House, Moi, DO, and Tinderess. The Milmet dam had a capacity of 200,000 cubic meters, and the dams collectively had a capacity of 600 Million cubic meters. The company produces large numbers of cut flowers for shipping to Germany and the Netherlands. The farm was responsible for the maintenance of the dam. According to the general manager of the farm, the dams were between 15 and 20 years old at the time of the incident. An investigation is currently being conducted to determine whether or not the dams were built legally and according to safety standards. Excessive rains began falling in March 2018 following a year of severe drought. This caused massive flooding in Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Somalia, affecting nearly a million people. Nearly 170 people in Kenya were killed in the floods which preceded and led to the breaking of the dam. The general manager of the farm stated that the rain had been particularly intense during the two days preceding the dam‚Äôs failure, and that resulting flood waters, carrying boulders and roots, had damaged the wall of the dam. According to Koigi Wamwere, a former legislator from the area, residents complained about leaks and cracks in the Patel Dam a few days before its failure. Dam burst The dam burst in the evening of 9 May 2018, just as many area families were beginning their evening meals. Residents reported hearing a loud bang immediately followed by the rushing of \\"a sea of water\\". of water were unleashed, creating a wall of water about high and wide. The resulting flood carved a chasm through a hill, washed away power poles, destroyed buildings (including a school), and submerged the villages of Nyakinyua and Energy. Homes over a radius of nearly were submerged. Aftermath So far, 48 have been confirmed dead, of whom more than 20 were children according to the national Creepomane Reports. Kenya‚Äôs Interior Secretary Fred Matiang'i, who arrived the day after the disaster, stated that the death toll could be higher as the rescue teams are likely to recover more bodies from the mud and debris. Authorities believe more than 2,000 people were left homeless. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned that the flooding which contributed to the dam failure is expected to get worse with additional heavy rains forecast in Nakuru over the coming weeks. Dam owner Patel released a statement on 15 May, six days after the disaster, expressing condolences to the affected family. He praised the government‚Äôs ongoing investigation and pledged his company‚Äôs continued cooperation. He also vowed to assist in providing resources for displaced families, many of whom worked for him on his farm. On 16 May, one week after the disaster, an interdenominational mass and memorial service was held at an Africa Inland Mission Church in Solai near the site of the dam. The service was attended by Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto, Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui and other prominent local and national public figures. In his remarks, President Kenyatta promised aid to displaced families and the processing of 1300 title deeds for affected residents. He also pledged government assistance in rebuilding schools, roads, and other infrastructure destroyed by the disaster. Dam owner Patel was not in attendance at the service, having been asked by local leaders not to attend due to security concerns. 41 of the victims were laid to rest in Solai immediately following the memorial service. =Rescue and recovery operation= An organized rescue operation was carried out in the days immediately following the dam failure. The rescue team was a joint effort involving the Kenya Defence Forces, Kenya Red Cross Society, the National Youth Service, and various local and regional police forces. During the first day of the disaster response, forty people were rescued and taken to hospitals operated by the Kenya Red Cross and other local relief organizations. On May 14, the official government response team announced that the 38 individuals who had been reported missing of May 10 were accounted for, either found alive or identified among the 48 bodies recovered at that point. Nonetheless, many residents responded that they still had additional friends and family unaccounted for. A temporary shelter was established for survivors in the Solai Boy's High School. The displaced there were provided with three months of living provisions and access to psychological counseling. On Saturday, May 19, 10 days after the disaster, the temporary shelter was closed so that school could resume the following Monday. 200 families were still at the shelter without any housing solutions at the time of the closure. On May 13, the European Union's Humanitarian Aid office (ECHO) announced that they were sending $1.8 Million to assist in the disaster relief efforts. =Investigation= Matiang'i announced the government‚Äôs investigation into the incident. The initial work of the investigation is focused on determining the stability of the other six dams on the Patel property, as residents claimed that some of the other dams were already beginning to leak. The day following the disaster, the government began controlled draining of two of the dams that were deemed structurally unsound. This led to some alarm among local residents that another dam had broken. The Director of Public Prosecutions ordered a police investigation into the incident to \\"establish cause and culpability if any\\" behind the dam failure within two weeks. On May 11, 2018, Kenya's Water Resources Management Authority (WARMA) concluded that none of the dams on the property were properly licensed and were therefore illegal. Engineers with WARMA also noted that the remaining dams were unsafe due to structural weakness and the absence of any spillways for discharging extra waters. Based on these findings, the regional minister in charge of water has requested that the other dams on the property also be drained. The farm‚Äôs general manager has denied that the dams were built illegally. On May 12, President Kenyatta directed WARMA to oversee a countrywide inspection of dams in coordination with county governments.

Children went to her school for the pleasure as well as instruction to be had there. She began to write when very young, changing pen names often, dreading to have the public know her as an author, until, after years of success, she gained courage to use her own name. Her writings consisted largely of poetry, but also included sketches on natural history, essays, letters of travel, and stories for children. Some of her songs were set to music. \\"Margaret, a Home Opera in Six Acts\\", is one of the best of her poetic productions. It was brought out in 1875.

During his lifetime he rarely exhibited his work. It was only after his death in 2013 that his life's work was revealed. Snee has been described as an \\"outstanding talent\\", \\"one of the 'lost painters' of the post- war period, and \\"one of the finest post-war abstract painters\\".  Biography  Gordon Snee was born in 1931 in Burnley, Lancashire, into a working-class family who worked in the cotton mills. The family moved to Gainsborough, Lincolnshire when Snee was six. He was the first of his family to be educated beyond the age of thirteen. In 1948 he won an academic scholarship to the Slade School of Art, where he won scholarships for further tuition. Six of his early lithographs are held in the Slade collection.https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/ After college, he stayed on in Highgate, London, where his first works were exhibited and sold. He moved back north in 1956, first to Lincolnshire, and then to Saddleworth in Lancashire. He taught art at Salford Technical College and then at Manchester College of Art. In 1976, he moved back to Lincolnshire, and set up a studio at his family home in the village of Willingham-by-Stow, near Gainsborough. He commuted by train every week from Gainsborough via Sheffield to his teaching work in Manchester. It is clear from his notebooks that these train journeys were an important time of reflection for him. He recalled them later in the 'Railway Ovals', one of his most successful series of pictures.Simon Evans The Joy of Seeing, (Sheffield: Gordon Snee Art, 2017) In 1983, Snee left teaching and returned to full-time painting. Over the next twenty years he produced his most accomplished work, a substantial body of abstract paintings, mostly in acrylic, that explores his experience of seeing. He also made woodcuts and detailed maquettes for sculptures. None of this work was exhibited in his lifetime. His last studio pictures were completed in 2003, and he continued to draw and sketch until 2013, the year that he died. The full extent of his work was discovered after his death in 2013. As well as hundreds of paintings, drawings and maquettes he also left a photographic archive of his major pieces, a substantial collection of sketches and work-up drawings, and some seventy notebooks. This legacy was saved from destruction on the day of his funeral by the intervention of his daughter Jo.  Work  Snee's early work is recognisable as kitchen sink realism. By the 1960s he had moved on to abstract art. He explored colour field, geometric abstraction and hard-edge painting. His mature work draws on the conventions of classical European painting, occupying a mid-ground between figuration and abstraction. Many pictures are recognisable as landscapes, head-and-shoulders portraits, still lifes, and pairs of human figures. His later paintings might be readable as any of these at the same time. = Exhibitions and prizes = Snee rarely exhibited his work. During his lifetime, his paintings were shown in Liverpol, Lancaster, Nottingham, Gainsborough, Manchester and London. His only solo show was at the Oldham Art Gallery in 1968. In 1967 his painting 'Malabu Mink' was a cash prize-winner in the John Moores Painting Prize. A series of 'pop-up' exhibitions were held in Sheffield following his death in 2013 and the discovery of his major work. A Foundation to support his legacy was launched at his first major retrospective, 'The Joy of Seeing', in 2018. = Retrospectives = * 2013 - \\"The Language of Abstraction\\", The Gage Gallery, KIAC, Sheffield. * 2014 - \\"The Life of Painting\\", Eagle Works, Green Lane, Kelham Island, Sheffield. * 2016 - \\"Natural Abstraction\\", Sheffield Winter Gardens. * 2017-18 - \\"The Joy of Seeing\\", Crossley Gallery, Dean Clough, Halifax.

Thanks to its long shelf life, the has been popular not only in Italy but also in export to countries such as Germany. Campanino apples are included in the list of Italian Traditional Foodstuffs ( ‚Äì PAT) from the Emilia-Romagna region, and in the Emilia-Romagna Regional Voluntary Database of Agricultural Genetic Resources (code RER V019). The cultivar is also widespread in the Veneto region, where it is called campan√¨n (code GM27) or Modena apple (code GM47).  History  The ancient origins of this variety are not known. An early reference was in 1751 when Francesco Argelati from Bologna described the character of Bartolomea Gualandi as In 1815, Italian pomologist Georges Gallesio described a seedling found in the province of Modena as \\"Modena apple\\". In 1877 historian Don Felice Ceretti from Mirandola, published an article in a local periodical in which he spoke about \\"apples called which are widely stocked in autumn and transported to Venice and other cities\\". After the Second World War, cultivation of apples decreased in favour of other varieties that are more productive, easier to grow, and more appreciated by consumers. Historian Vilmo Cappi (1918‚Äì2013) wrote that the apple was disappearing because it was being replaced by more commercial varieties and types of apples. There are still those, however, who prefer the fruit since it can last all winter long with its fragrance kept intact while its clean and white pulp looks like marble.  Description  Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena and apples The fruits of the apple tree are small, usually symmetrical, and usually spheroidal (about in diameter by in height), with a weight of about . The skin is thick and not very waxy, of a yellow-green colour which becomes red-green when the fruit is exposed to sunlight. The flesh is greenish-white, very firm, and sugary. It is also aromatic and slightly acidic. A scientific study carried out by the University of Bologna on characteristics of five ancient varieties of apple highlighted Campanino's qualities. It contains high amounts of antioxidants (up to four times more than Golden Delicious apples), high content of pectin and polyphenols, as well as ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The flowering season occurs in April‚ÄìMay, and the apple can be harvested for about a month from the beginning of October. Matured Campaninas have red skin colouration especially after they have been exposed to the sun for 5‚Äì7 days: for this reason Campanina apple is also called as the \\"Annurca apple of Northern Italy\\". Unlike other varieties, apples can be easily preserved for six months without any use of refrigeration. This characteristic has allowed the survival of Campanino variety until today.  Growing area  Exposition of Campanine apples during the annual festival held in San Possidonio (Modena) The apple growing area is located in the Northeast Italy, in the provinces of Ferrara, Mantua, Modena, Reggio Emilia and Rovigo. The variety is also widespread in the province of Venice, where it is known as \\"Modenese apple\\". Main municipalities where Campanino grows: * Province of Ferrara: Argenta, Ferrara e Portomaggiore * Province of Mantua: Carbonara di Po, Pegognaga, Poggio Rusco, Quistello, San Benedetto Po, San Giacomo delle Segnate, San Giovanni del Dosso, Roverbella, and Schivenoglia * Province of Modena: all the municipalities of Po plain * Province of Reggio Emilia: Bagnolo in Piano, Campagnola Emilia, Correggio, Fabbrico, Novellara, Reggio Emilia, Rio Saliceto, Rolo, and San Martino in Rio * Province of Rovigo: Adria, Badia Polesine, Canaro, Costa di Rovigo, Crespino, Lendinara, Rovigo, San Martino di Venezze, and Trecenta * Province of Venice: Dolo, Fossalta, Jesolo, Mira, Mirano, Noale, Portogruaro, Salzano, Scorz√®, and Venice  Use  Campanino is often used as a cooking apple since its flesh remains intact and compact even after cooking. It is also excellent when eaten fresh as it retains all its nutrients even months after being harvested. The Campanino apple can be eaten raw, but because of its thick skin, people prefer it for cooking, preferably in a casserole with a little water, and a simple dusting of sugar, which is then caramelized in the oven. The apple's pulp is used to make jam, (including ), and sav√≥r, or ingredients for apple pie or pancakes. Traditional mostarda, a sweet-and-hot condiment made from Campanina apples or quinces, sugar and mustard, has been served with boiled meats as far back as the Middle Ages.

His first love was always painting, but he trained as an architect and was successful in this profession in Madrid in the years before the Spanish Civil War. During the civil war he helped preserve national artistic treasures from the destruction of Madrid, and also designed bomb shelters. After the fall of the Second Spanish Republic in 1939 he fled to France, where he was interned for two months, then made his way to Paris and on to exile in Mexico. He resumed his career as an architect in Mexico, but gradually abandoned architecture in favour of painting. He chose not to exhibit his work and was little known until he was finally persuaded to put on a show in Mexico City at the age of 70, when he was acclaimed as a master of modern Mexican art. Early years Jes√∫s Mart√≠ Mart√≠n was born in Castell√≥n de la Plana, Spain, in 1899. At an early age he decided to become a painter, but his father advised him to also study architecture so he could earn a living. He was educated at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando and at the Superior Technical School of Architecture of Madrid. At the student's residence in Madrid he became the friend of like-minded young men such as Salvador Dal√≠, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Luis Bu√±uel and Rafael Alberti. He completed his studies of architecture as an outstanding graduate when he was 24. Garc√≠a Lomas proposed Mart√≠ as architect for the Madrid City Council. In this position he realized the first tall houses on the Goya and O'Donnell streets, but his most outstanding work was the plans for a group of low-cost house in El Escorial. He then moved to the north of Spain and built several summer residences. He collaborated with other architects in winning a competition for agricultural villages for the areas irrigated by the Guadalquivir and Guadalmellato. He and Manuel S√°nchez Arcas designed a new building for the Center for Historical Studies. He was associated with the \\"Generation of '27\\", a group of architects involved in the European avant-garde at that time. In 1929 Mart√≠ collaborated with Miguel Garc√≠a-Lomas Somoano on the Edificio Vita office building in the University District of Madrid. In 1930 he again collaborated with Garc√≠a-Lomas on the 8-story Viviendas Casta√±o, a collective housing building in the Goya barrio of the Salamanca district of Madrid. The building covers the area within the acute angle where Alcal√° meets Ensanche, and resembles the rounded prow of a ship. It is a notable example of rationalist architecture. In 1931 he was a professor at the School of Architecture in Madrid when the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed. He helped prevent some anti-monarchist groups from destroying the royal statues on the Plaza de Oriente, but was a strong supporter of the Republic and a member of the intellectual and artistic circles of Madrid. He continued to be very active as an architect. During the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39) Mart√≠ worked for the Ministry of Education in defense of national artistic treasures, and for the Popular Army in construction of bomb shelters. The director of the Defense Board was his close friend Josep Renau. Mart√≠ and the architect Jos√© Lino Vaamonde helped transfer the great masterpieces of the Madrid museums to Valencia, where they avoided being destroyed by Franco's artillery and bombers. They also helped design bomb shelters in the Cuatro Caminos and Pac√≠fico neighborhoods of Madrid. In 1937 Mart√≠ and the architect Luis Lacassa(es) attended the International Housing Congress in Moscow. After his return he was invited to designed the International Pavilion of the Spanish Republic in Paris but chose to stay in Madrid and continue designing shelters. When the war ended Mart√≠ and Luis Lacassa fled to France on foot. He was imprisoned at the Argel√®s-sur-Mer refugee camp for two months, then was released thanks to the efforts of Pablo Picasso. He settled in Paris with his wife Matilde, selling his paintings for a living, then managed to move to Mexico. Mexico Mart√≠'s first work in Mexico was with SERE (Servicio de Evacuaci√≥n de Republicanos Espa√±oles(es)), and he also built some private residences in Mexico City and Cuernavaca. The entrepreneur Manuel Su√°rez y Su√°rez and Mart√≠ founded the company V√≠as y Obras (Roads and Works), which built facilities in the ports of Veracruz, Acapulco and other cities. Mart√≠ organized the company with the Valencian architect Enrique Segarra(it), Arturo S√°enz de la Calzada(es) and the civil engineer Carlos Gaos. He also collaborated with other exiled architects including F√©lix Candela and Juan Rivaud. His most important work included the Hotel Mocambo in Veracruz and the Casino de la Selva in Cuernavaca. In 1946 the Casino de la Selva was closed so that V√≠as y Obras could undertake various enlargements under the direction of Mart√≠. The two blocks of rooms were each given a second floor, and a French-style garden was laid out in the area between them. New rooms were added to the main building. Other additions included a large convention hall, a bowling alley and cafeteria, a walkway around the Olympic pool, two more pools and sandy areas to give a beach-like atmosphere. The effect was much like the Hotel Mocambo. F√©lix Candela came to Mexico to escape Francoist Spain and worked for V√≠as y Obras from 1942 to 1947. He helped Mart√≠ in his renovation of the Casino de la Selva. In Mexico Mart√≠ became a lifetime friend of several Spanish Republican exiles including the writer Emilio Prados, the philosopher Jos√© Gaos, the poets Manuel Altolaguirre and Le√≥n Felipe, the poster artist Josep Renau and the painters Manuela Ballester(es) and Enrique Climent(es). Mart√≠ spent more and more time painting, and eventually abandoned the practice of architecture. He painted for pleasure and did not try to sell or exhibit his work. His style reflected impressionist concepts, but he was not tied to any school. Under pressure from his friends including Jorge Hern√°ndez Campos, head of the Department of Plastic Arts of the National Institute of Fine Arts, he finally exhibited his paintings at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1970 when he was aged 70. His fresh and vigorous painting was acclaimed and he was called one of the masters of contemporary Mexican painting. Mart√≠ died in Mexico City in 1975. There is a street named in his honour in Castell√≥n.

Education and early life  Parry was born in Australia and studied for a Trained Secondary Teachers Certificate (T.S.T.C.) in Sculpture in Melbourne from 1959-1961, followed by a Diploma of Art (Printmaking) at the Glasgow School of Art from 1970-1974. She gained a Post Diploma (Printed Textiles) at Glasgow School of Art in 1975.  Teaching  Parry spent time from 1961 to 1970 teaching and travelling in Australia, Europe and Asia. She worked as a Studio Assistant in the Printmaking Department at the Glasgow School of Art from 1976-1981, then at the same institution she worked as a lecturer in papermaking in 1981, was a lecturer on the MA Design course from 1981 to 1985, lectured in the Sculpture Department from 1985 to 1991, was senior lecturer in Fine Art: Head of Printmaking from 1991-2001 and subsequently taught in the Department of Fine Art from 2001 to 2006.  Career  Parry is recognised for her work around paper, both using it as a medium on which to print and as a material in its own right: > \\"For most of the last forty years my investigations have been based on > developing ideas in paper using it variously as substrate, as independent > medium, and in combination with other materials. > My work draws on two areas of subject-matter which separately and together > continue to sustain me : a response on the one hand to changes in landscape > and the elements, and on the other to information, its containment and > manipulation.\\" Parry moved to live and work in Scotland in 1965. She was one of eight founding members who set up Glasgow Print Studio in 1972, while she was a student at Glasgow School of Art. In 1985 she set up the Paper Workshop in Glasgow. She studied papermaking in Barcelona with Laurence Barker and in Shiroishi, Japan, with Tadao Endo. Parry is Member of the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1984, Parry appeared in the BBC Scotland film 'The Lunch Party' (directed by Eleanor Aitken), in conversation with Liz Lochhead and Lys Hansen. Her work has been described by the New Hall Art Collection, a permanent collection of contemporary art by women artists, as responding \\"to changes in landscape and the elements and to information, its containment and manipulation\\". Her 1988 exhibition, Daly River Night, was shown at the Third Eye Centre, Glasgow until April 23 that year. The exhibition took its name from Parry returning to Australia and making an expedition to the North-West Territory along the Daly River. Cordelia Oliver writing in the Guardian recorded that the exhibition reflected both the \\"rare moisture in a desiccated landscape\\" and that the \\"poetic quality that pervades the gallery is inescapably tinged with disquiet. Nature in the raw, Jacki Parry seems to be saying, is both beautiful and fearful.\\" To celebrate its anniversary in 2012, the Glasgow Women's Library asked 21 artists and 21 writers to create work in response to its collection. The art, by Sam Ainsley, Clare Barclay, Lucy Skaer, Karla Black, Jacki Parry and others was exhibited at Intermedia in Glasgow and the RSA in Edinburgh while the writing by A L Kennedy, Janice Galloway, Muriel Gray, Denise Mina and Jackie Kay and others featured in a coffee-table book. Parry's contribution to celebrate the anniversary was to recreate a street map of Glasgow, naming the streets after the women featured on the Library‚Äôs heritage walking tour.

The film, directed by Douglas Mackinnon, stars Mellor as Rita Pickering, a working class mother who witnesses a brutal drugs killing. After she testifies in court, she is threatened by a number of gang members, and fearing for her life, goes on the run and is forced to turn to shoplifting to survive. Liz Smith stars as Rita's elderly neighbour Lizzie, while Angel Coulby takes on the role of Rita's daughter Leah. The film was Mellor's first acting role in several years after initially giving up acting and turning her hand to scriptwriting. The film drew 6.06 million viewers on its debut broadcast. Notably, the film has never been released on VHS or DVD. Casting The film was shelved for several years after the initial casting fell through. Mellor stated; \\"A Good Thief was the only script that ended up in my trunk unproduced. I wrote it for Pippa Cross and Granada Television and when the original casting fell through it was something I put to one side whilst I concentrated on other projects.\\" Mellor stated she originally wrote the role of Rita for Julie Walters, although she was unable to commit to the role due to other work commitments. Reception The Northern Echo reviewed the film following its debut broadcast, commenting: \\"This was one of those TV movies that couldn't decide whether to be funny or serious. Mixing killings and beatings up with almost slapstick comic capers is difficult. And A Good Thief lurched uncertainly from comedy to drama, leaving the poor viewer uncertain if to laugh or cry.

The plaintiff argued that the school district had ignored, \\"the federal rights of its citizens to be free from racial quotas and to be free from extensive pupil transportation that destroys fundamental rights of liberty and privacy.\\" The District argued that it had acted in accordance with its court-ordered and approved plan to desegregate the district. In the 1977 case the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. However, in the 1978 case, the court ruled in favor of the Board of Education.

History The barrier is one of three built during the Nara period to mark the border between the territory controlled by the Yamato state and the Emishi tribes of the T≈çhoku region of northern Honsh≈´, although there is archaeological evidence to show that it may actually dat to as early as the latter half of the 5th century in the Kofun period. Its first appearance in historical records is dated December 3, 835, at which time the barrier is mentioned to be four hundred years old. The barrier served as a border fortress against excursions of the Emishi to the south, and to regulate and control traffic from the central provinces of Japan to the north. During the Nara period, it marked the northern border of Yamato control. By the early to mid-Heian period, Yamato forces gradually conquered the Emeshi, and the barrier fell into ruin as it had become redundant. It had largely vanished by the start of the Kamakura period. However, memory of the barrier was preserved as a makurakotoba in Japanese poetry, metaphorically evoking images of distance, transition and loneliness. The site was lost until the mid-Edo period, when it was rediscovered by Matsudaira Sadanobu, daimy≈ç of Shirakawa Domain based on a study of ancient texts in the year 1800. He marked the location with a stone monument and the construction of a Shinto shrine, the Shirakawa Jinja. The site was excavated by archaeologists from 1956 to 1963, and the remains of a dry moat, a double wooden palisade and earthen ramparts were uncovered, along with the foundations of pit dwellings and blacksmith workshops.

Flannigan is best known for her imagined paintings of women in psychologically charged situations. \\"The real subject of my paintings is space, both physical and psychological. [...] Space in a painting is not simply an environment for action; it‚Äôs a place with formal relationships that have inherent hidden meaning.\\"  Education and teaching  Flannigan was born in Kirkcaldy in 1963. She obtained a Bachelor of Arts from Edinburgh College of Art in 1985 and a Master of Fine Art from Yale University School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut in 1987. Formerly a lecturer in painting at Glasgow School of Art (1995 - 2005), Flannigan was a teaching fellow at Edinburgh College of Art, University of Edinburgh (2015-2019).  Influences  The Glasgow Herald in 2014, at the time of her Generations show, Flannigan discussed drawing inspiration from the work of surrealist sculptor Alberto Giacometti. His work Femme √©gorg√©e (Woman With Her Throat Cut) \\"fed its way into her subconscious\\". She has also drawn inspiration from the 1979 art film, Stalker, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, and from Masaccio's masterly 15th- century fresco, Expulsion From The Garden Of Eden in the Brancacci Chapel, Florence, which she visited as part of her residency in Rome. While Giacometti's 1932 bronze, is \\"a worrying human-insect hybrid, a splayed, disembowelled figure part praying mantis, part crime victim, Flannigan turns up the volume of Giacometti's angst-ridden attitude to the female form; her own painted figures echo his sculpture's splayed structure, but are defiantly, terrifyingly alive with their blood red lips and stiletto heels\\".

The sale price for the site and of air rights worked out to over $1,100 per buildable square foot, a record for a Manhattan condominium development. The site was formerly a brownfield, and HFZ received a $60 million tax credit for the environmental cleanup of the land. A consortium of lenders including JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and SL Green provided $1 billion in acquisition and predevelopment financing at the time. HFZ expected the development to cost over $1.9 billion ($1,700 per square foot), one of the most expensive developments ever undertaken in Manhattan. In May 2017, UK hedge fund The Children's Investment Fund provided a $1.25 billion senior mortgage to HFZ, one of the largest construction loans ever issued for a Manhattan project. The project also received $258 million from an EB-5 mezzanine loan and HFZ committed $225 million of equity. Pegasus Capital Advisors, the owners of Six Sense, also invested $30 million of equity into the hotel portion of the project. Construction for the project began in September 2016 with pilings driven for the foundations of the towers. The taller West tower topped out in August 2018. Construction is expected to conclude in 2019. The shorter East tower topped out in February 2019. Sales for the project began in May 2018, with prices ranging from $2.8 million for a one-bedroom to $25 million for a half-floor penthouse.

Architecture and design The project consists of two towers, a 34-story Western tower named \\"N¬∞ I\\" and a 25-story Eastern tower named \\"N¬∞ X\\". The two buildings will be clad with travertine and connected by a double height sky bridge rising from floor to ceiling, called the ‚ÄúBridge Lounge.‚Äù Bjarke Ingels' BIG served as executive architect for both towers with Woods Bagot as architect of record. New York-based firm Gabellini Sheppard designed the interiors of the West tower and Parisian firm Gilles & Boissier designed the interiors of the East Tower. The West tower consists of 149 condos while the East tower contains the Six Senses hotel and 87 condos beginning on the 11th floor. The space between the two buildings serves as a porte-coch√®re and courtyard with plantings, designed by the Swiss landscape architect Enzo Enea. Amenities for condo owners include the \\"XI Club\\" which contains a fitness center with a pool, a lounge and gallery in the glass bridge, a wine tasting room, a social lounge with billiards tables, a teen room and a children‚Äôs playroom. The \\"XI Gallery\\", a art gallery, sits as street-level and features a site-specific installation by British artist Es Devlin. At the base, the two towers separate from each other and the neighboring buildings of Chelsea to maximize space and views on the lower floors. As they rise, the towers re- orient towards the West to maximize the light afforded each unit as well as views of the Hudson River. The twisting geometry at the corners of the towers also reduces the overall bulk of the buildings and creates additional separation between the towers.Bjarke Ingels Group According to the architect, the fa√ßade design is inspired by the punched windows of the Meatpacking district's historic warehouses as well as the architecture of the surrounding West Chelsea neighborhood. Even though the fa√ßade is set on a sloping concrete exposure, each individual window remains rectangular and vertical. The windows are also accented by a thin metal frame, which helps them stand out against the surrounding stone. The building sits adjacent to Frank Gehry's nearby IAC Building and is one of several designed by high-profile architects in the area after an increase in development activity due to the popularity of the High Line. Reception The building has been described as belonging to the deconstructivism architectural movement. Reviewers have compared the complex's design to Santiago Calatrava's award-winning Turning Torso project in Malm√∂, Sweden as well as Rafael Vi√±oly's 432 Park Avenue. English abstract sculptor Henry Moore has also been cited as another inspiration. The towers have also been less favorably described as \\"two drunken figures on the verge of keeling over.\\" The bridge connecting the two towers that contains amenities and space for condo owners has been compared to the similar skybridge connecting the two towers of SHoP Architects's American Copper Buildings in Murray Hill.

He was affectionately known as Jannie in Dutch.  Early life and career  Marais was born on 8 September 1851 on the wine estate Coetsenburg in Stellenbosch, the youngest of ten children. He was educated at the Stellenbosch Gymnasium. In 1870, at the age of nineteen, he joined three of his older brothers who were prospecting for diamonds along the Vaal River. The following year, they went to New Rush, as Kimberley was then known. There, Marais earned a fortune. In 1880, he combined several mining interests to form the Kimberley Central Mining Company in which his brothers also had valuable shares. Later, the mining concern merged with De Beers Consolidated Mines and the brothers gained substantial interests in the company. Jannie Marais returned to Coetsenburg in 1892 a very rich man. He purchased the estate from his widowed mother and began diversified farming. At the age of 55 he married 38-year-old Elizabeth (Bessie) de Villiers from Paarl. In 1899, he became a member of the Cape parliament and later, when the Union of South Africa was established in 1910, a member of the national parliament. He remained a parliamentary member till his death. Marais also served on various boards such as the Stellenbosch University Hospital and Divisional Council. His business interests also included the Lion Distillery (now Van Ryn's Distillery of Distell Group Limited) on the Vlottenburg estate and the Malmesbury Voogdy-en Assuransiemaatskappy.  Later career and philanthropy  On 12 May 1914, along with sixteen other men, Jannie Marais attended a meeting at Heemstede, the house of the banker Hendrik Bergh in Stellenbosch. At the meeting, they agreed to establish a company which was registered the following year as De Nationale Pers Beperkt (Dutch for the National Press Limited). Soon thereafter, it was renamed in Afrikaans, Die Nasionale Pers Beperkt, and in 1998, Naspers which is an abbreviation of Die Nasionale Pers Beperkt. Jannie Marais put up most of its funding. Their purpose was to create a publishing and printing company: \\"For the free unimpeded expression of public opinion on all major issues in our country; the commercial and service imperative must complement each other.\\" (Dutch: \\"Voor de vrije onbelemmerde uiting van die volksmening aangaande alle belangrike vraagstukken in ons land; kommersi√´le en diensimperatief moet mekaar aanvul.\\") The company's first project was the establishment of the Afrikaans newspaper Die Burger. Today, Naspers is a broad-based multi-national internet and media group, offering services in more than 130 countries with a market cap of $114 billion. In 1915, Jannie Marais bequeathed ¬£100,000 (worth about ¬£1 billion today) to establish the University of Stellenbosch.http://www.stellenboschheritage.co.za/property/coetzenburg- homestead-jannie-marais-house On his death in 1915, Marais and his wife had no children. He donated some of his money to Die Instituut vir Dowes en Blindes (English: The Institute for the Deaf and Blind) in Worcester and the Kindersendinghuis (English: Orphanage) in Cape Town. The rest of his estate established Het Jan Marais Nationale Fonds (English: The Jan Marais National Fund),http://hetjanmarais.co.za/ a scholarship trust which continues to support thousands of students. Jannie Marais died on 30 May 1915 at the hot springs of Montagu. He is buried on the summit of the Papegaaiberg in Stellenbosch.

Davenport House, also known as the Davenport-Curtis House, is a single-family home located at 300 East Michigan Avenue in Saline, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. History William H. Davenport was born in New York state in 1826, and arrived in Michigan with his family the next year. Davenport moved to Saline at the age of twelve after his father's death, and began working as a mercantile clerk. In 1851 he married Zilpha Parsons, and that same year partnered with H. J. Miller to open a general store. In 1853 he bought out Miller's interest and, over the following years, Davenport became Saline's most prominent merchant. In 1875, Davenport hired Detroit architect William Scott to design this house. The Davenports selected many of the furnishings for the house from manufacturer displays at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. In 1883, Davenport abandoned his general store, and in 1885 he opened a bank, which became publicly owned in 1902. Davenport lived in this house until his death in 1909. The house remained in the Davenport family until 1930, when family friend Carl Alward Curtiss inherited the house and its antique furnishings. Description The Davenport House is a Second Empire mansion, located by itself on a city block at the entrance to Saline, surrounded by mature trees. The house is a two-and-a-half-story frame structure with a slate-covered mansard roof and corner tower. It sits on a cut stone foundation, and the exterior contains ornate bracketry, corbels, lintels, and dormers. Two original carriage barns with slate mansard roofs stand behind the house. On the interior, the woodwork is made from the finest hardwoods - walnut, butternut, and maple - throughout the house. The house still contains antiques purchased at the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition of 1876. The full-length windows are topped with carved interior cornices and the ceilings are decorated with sculptured plaster.

After his military service, he received his LL.B. from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem where he studied from 1992-1995. A few years later, between 2002-2004, Avni continued his studies and completed his MBA in a joint program between Tel Aviv University and the Kellogg School of Business at Northwestern University in Chicago (Kellogg-Recanati Program). Avni is married to Rita Avni, founder and CEO of one of Israel‚Äôs leading forensic accountant firms, Avni Advisory Services. Together they are parents to two daughters as well as two sons from previous marriages. The family lives in Tel Aviv. Career Avni is a member of the Israeli Bar Association since 1996, the same year he began working as an attorney at Yigal Arnon & Co. From 2000-2004, he became a General Partner at Jerusalem Global Ventures, an Israel-based venture capital fund. As of 2018, Avni is a member on the board of directors at Charge After. He previously served as a director at Kashya (acquired by EMC) and the advisory board of Fundbox. He also serves as Chairman of the Association of Credit Companies in Israel. In 2004, Avni founded a private company named Peninsula and serves as its CEO. Peninsula provides credit to growing small and medium-sized Israeli businesses that advance Israeli industries. The company‚Äôs shares are divided between the investment firm Meitav Dash (52%), Micah Lakin Avni (16.35%), Migdal Insurance Company Ltd. (8.66%) and the public. In December 2014, Peninsula began to be traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Peninsula is rated ‚ÄúA‚Äù by S&P; Maalot. Peninsula expanded and also established investment private equity fund. In December 2015, the company won a bid of ILS 450 million to the Ministry of Economy for the establishment and management of an investment fund for long-term growth of medium-sized businesses. In August 2017, another fund was launched called ‚ÄúThe Peninsula Fund for 100+ Businesses‚Äù scaled at about ILS 200 million. In September 2012, Avni wrote an article published in the ‚ÄúCalcalist‚Äù journal which discussed limiting the use of cash. This prompted a discussion that appointed the ‚ÄúLocker Committee‚Äù to reduce the use of cash. The committee‚Äôs conclusions turned into a bill which was adopted into law by the Israeli parliament in 2018 and will go into effect at the beginning of 2019. In each of the years 2015, 2016 and 2018 Avni was elected to the list of The Marker‚Äôs 100 Most Influential People in Israel following his involvement in opening the credit market to free competition. Anti-terrorism activism Avni's father, Richard Lakin, a retired elementary school principal and a peace activist, was stabbed in the face and chest and shot in the head by Palestinian attackers while riding the #78 bus in Jerusalem during the wave of Palestinian terrorism in October, 2015. After his father‚Äôs death, Avni published an opinion piece in The New York Times in November 2015 that raised public debate on the issue of social media incitement. Due to the increased amount of activities related to the subject, Avni established a movement against incitement on social media titled ‚ÄúStop Incitement‚Äù, and initiated ‚ÄúLakin‚Äôs Law‚Äù at the same year. The law proposes regulation of Facebook in Israel in cases of posts that encourage incitement. Avni gave two speeches at the United Nations and interviewed on CNN about it as well as met with the US Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon. In March, 2016, Avni spoke for the first time before the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, urging them, and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to condemn the murder of a civilian on a bus in Israel as an act of terrorism, calling the failure of the United Nations and the Secretary-General to do so an act of \\"hypocrisy.\\" ‚ÄúKilling civilians on a bus is terror. I challenge you to specifically condemn the murder of my father, Richard Lakin‚Äù, Avni stated when appearing before the UN and Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, who visited following the murder in Armon Hanatziv. His second appearance occurred on 09.12.2016 when a closed discussion was held on the cessation of incitement that encourages terrorist activity. Avni said: ‚Äúextreme terrorist organizations use social networks to incite and encourage young people around the world to join them‚Äù, calling the phenomenon, ‚Äúopen source jihad.‚Äù He said social media networks incited Baha ‚ÄòAlian, his father‚Äôs murderer, who was later described as a shahid on Facebook. Avni called on the UN ‚Äúto condemn the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority for creating a culture of hatred and an ecosystem of incitement to terror, and demand that the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority stop poisoning the minds of innocent Palestinian children against peace.‚Äù In the wake of his father's murder, Avni became a lead plaintiff in the Shurat HaDin#2015 Facebook lawsuit filed in a New York state court by 2,000 Israeli victims of Palestinian terror attack against Facebook on the grounds that the social media company permitted the posting of \\"incitement to murder and the glorification of violence against innocent civilians.\\" His father's murderer, Bahas Alian, had announced his planned attack in advance on Facebook. In total, Avni filed two civil suits against Facebook. One of the suits totaled one billion dollars. At 2017 Avni was involved in efforts to expose the phenomenon of videos on YouTube that encourage terrorism and are funded by advertisements of international corporations. Following investigation and publication on the topic by the British Times, there has been a decrease in the number of videos on social media networks that encourage incitement, violence, and racism as well as the removal of Hamas and its leaders‚Äô social media accounts. In March 2018 Avni appeared again in front of the UN Human Rights Council where he said: ‚ÄúThe Palestinian Authority actually has a pay-to-play law. Palestinians systematically pay terrorists to murder Jews\\". Members of this council, what if I were to pay 300 million dollars to have all of your fathers butchered, would you report on that?‚Äù As of January 2018, Avni also serves as the Chairman of Concert ‚Äì Together for Israel (previously known as ‚ÄúKela Shlomo,‚Äù a public-private partnership established to combat the delegitimization of the State of Israel and the BDS movement.

Born in Ostend, Becu trained as a radio operator and joined the merchant navy. He soon became involved in trade unionism, and in 1929 became the full-time assistant general secretary of the International Mercantile Marine Officers' Association. In 1932, he was elected as the union's general secretary, simultaneously becoming general secretary of the Belgian Union of Merchant Marine Officers. In this role, he gave support to the republicans in the Spanish Civil War. Threatened by World War II, Becu escaped to the UK in 1940, continuing in his trade union posts. The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) took an interest in his activities, and in 1941 invited him to New York, where he set up a special section of the federation for workers in countries which had been occupied by the Nazis. In support of this, he travelled to North Africa, and later to Italy. He next returned to London, where he continued his ITF activity, making plans for the end of the war. In 1944, Becu was able to return to Belgium, where he and some surviving comrades began re-establishing the trade union movement. He was elected as the president of the Belgian Union of Transport Workers, and in 1947 also became the president of the ITF. In 1950, he was appointed as the ITF's general secretary, giving up his posts in Belgium, and in 1953 he was additionally elected as president of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).

The book was favorably received by critics and won the 2018 Caldecott Award. The story has drawn comparisons to fairy tales like Little Red Riding Hood. The nearly wordless book tells the story of a girl and wolf who each get lost in the snowstorm. Cordell used distinctive illustration techniques for the girl and the wolf. Plot In this nearly wordless picture book a girl and a wolf each get lost in a snowstorm. The two meet as the storm ends and the girl picks up the wolf and follows the sounds of wolves she hears, encountering some dangers along the way. After returning the wolf to its mother the girl gets lost and falls. The wolves howl to let one of the girl's searching parents know where to find her. The words that are present reflect the sounds and actions of the story. Themes and illustrations Several critics noted the parallels between Wolf in the Snow and fairy tales like Little Red Riding Hood. This allusion was something Cordell thought about. The concept for the book started with his drawing a girl in a red coat in a white field looking at a wolf, \\"I liked the graphic color combination of the black, the red, and the white. I liked the suspense created by the child and the wolf and the unanswered question of what was happening or not happening or what was going to happen between the two.\\" Critics also noted the value of loyalty and kindness being returned by the wolves. Cordell used blended watercolors in a \\"freeform\\" way for the illustrations. There is a marked contrast in the drawings between the way the girl, who is drawn \\"almost cartoonish[ly]\\" and the scary realism of the wolves. The importance and role of the book's typography drew comparisons to comic books. Reception and awards Wolf in the Snow received positive reviews and was noted on best of year lists. Writing for School Library Journal Peter Blenski called the book, \\"A heartwarming adventure about helping others, best shared one-on-one to pore over the engaging images\\" and awarded the book a star. Maggie Reagan in a starred review for Booklist also noted a similar them saying the book \\"is a tender, never precious story of kindness and cooperation.\\" In another starred review Kirkus Reviews, described the book as a one that is \\"deeply satisfying\\" and \\"keep[s] readers hooked to the end.\\" It also received starred reviews from Horn Book Guide, Horn Book Magazine, and Publishers Weekly. It was also listed as a best book of 2017 by National Public Radio who noted that \\"Cordell offers young readers a dreamy fable with a lot to say about making connections outside your comfort zone\\" Horn Book Magazine, School Library Journal, Kirkus, the Boston Globe, and Huffington Post where it was called \\"a new parable for our times. The American Library Association awarded the book its 2018 Caldecott Medal citing its \\"fairy tale elements and a strong sense of color and geometry offer an engrossing, emotionally charged story.\\" Award Committee Chair Tish Wilson said, ‚ÄúCommittee members were astonished that a deceptively simple book could be such a dramatic story of survival.‚Äù In his Caldecott acceptance speech, Cordell revealed that an early illustration that turned into the story came from his disappointment that an earlier book of his, Hello! Hello!, had not been recognized for the Caldecott. Cordell, Matthew. \\"Caldecott Medal Acceptance.\\" The Horn Book Magazine, July-Aug. 2018, p. 47+. General OneFile. Accessed 10 Aug. 2018.

Controversies On 8 February 2016, deputy Yehor Firsov left the parliamentary faction of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc in the Verkhovna Rada because of position in the conflict between the Minister of Economic Development Aivaras Abromaviƒçius and Ihor Kononenko. Firsov also said that he does not want to remain in the party and the faction whose leaders are engaged in \\"corrupt activities\\". In February 2016, Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Vitaly Kasko resigned as prosecutor alleging corruption in the prosecution service. One example was that the Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, had told him Kononenko had asked the service to influence a prosecution. Kas'ko said that Shokin had given him instructions, which Shokin took from Kononenko, to intervene in the case: \\"I received a firm request from the General Prosecutor in reference to this, declining to give details of the case. I refused to carry it out. I didn‚Äôt do as I was told,\\" Kasko said in an interview with Reuters. On 15 June 2016, journalist and People's deputy Serhiy Leshchenko said that the issue is being discussed in the United Kingdom and the United States about putting Kononenko under sanctions. \\"I am concerned about the possibility of Mr. Kononenko in the future to freely travel around the world and dispose of his money, because the issue of international sanctions regarding him is no longer a joke, but seriously negotiated in European capitals,\\" Leshchenko said. In September 2016, Serhiy Leshchenko blamed Ihor Kononenko, Alexander Granovskiy and Mykola Martynenko for organizing an information attack on him, which consisted in disclosing confidential information about the purchase of his apartment. Earlier, in March of the same year, Leshchenko told the media that President Petro Poroshenko personally asked him not to write articles on \\"members of his family\\", to which he attributed Viktor Shokin and Ihor Kononenko: \\"Last time when he proposed not to write about Shokin and Kononenko, he said that they were members of his family; that, in principle, he supports my criticism of Kolomoyskyi, but if I write about the man of his family, I must ask his opinion. I asked who he had in mind. I do not touch his wife.\\" In October 2016, Serhiy Zuyev, who won competition to fill the vacancy of head of Ukrenergo, stated that Ihor Kononenko initiated the opening of criminal cases against him. This was published by Ukrainian deputy and journalist Serhiy Leshchenko. He added that the \\"Prosecutor's Office of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea\\" opened a case against Zuyev in which he accused in financing subversive activities against Ukraine. In November 2016, the former President of Georgia and ex-Governor of Ukraine's Odessa Oblast, Mikheil Saakashvili, accused Ihor Kononenko and his colleague Alexander Granovskiy for being instructed by president Petro Poroshenko to prepare the question of depriving of his citizenship of Ukraine. In December 2016, the former member of the People's Will faction in the Verkhovna Rada, Oleksandr Onyshchenko, told the Kyiv Post that Ihor Kononenko, on behalf of President Poroshenko, was engaged in corruption. According to him, Kononenko receives $ 20 from each ton of coal supplied from the uncontrolled part of Donbass. According to Onyshchenko, Kononenko received 2 thousand hryvnia from every thousand cubic meters of gas that his company supplied to state-owned enterprises Odessa Port Plant and Centrenergo. Oleksandr Onyshchenko gave journalists recordings of telephone conversations and scans of documents related to the activities of then- President Petro Poroshenko and his associates. In particular, Onyshchenko pointed out that Kononenko, together with Serhiy Berezenko (People's Deputy of Ukraine in 2015-2019), established unofficial control over the Ukrainian electric power industry. During the Shuster Live TV-show, people‚Äôs deputy Serhiy Leshchenko published an SMS correspondence between Onyshchenko and Kononenko. They corresponded about gas supplies to the Centrenergo, a major electric and thermal energy producing company in central and eastern Ukraine. Due these facts, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) opened a criminal case. In September 2018, Ihor Kononenko came in to NABU for an interview. On 20 December 2019 the law enforcers raided both Poroshenko‚Äôs party headquarters and Ihor Kononenko's gym. Hidden cameras and recording devices were found inside the gym‚Äôs smoke detectors and security alarms. According to the State Investigation Bureau those were allegedly secretly recording and filming Kononenko and Poroshenko's gym clients, of which are politicians and businessmen. Poroshenko and Igor Kononenko, deputy head of Poroshenko's party, are both owners of said gym and could not be reached for comment.

She was built by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, Kiel, Germany, while her armament was installed by Armstrong Whitworth, Elswick, England. She was the lead ship of the , alongside her sister vessel , which was based on the design of the cruiser . Nan Chen was considered to be obsolete by the Western Powers even at the time of her construction. She was active during the Sino-French War of 1884‚Äì1885, first as part of a defensive squadron based at Nanking (now Nanjing). Nan Chen then formed part of the cruiser force of the Chinese squadron sent to engage the French blockade of Formosa (now Taiwan) which resulted in the Battle of Shipu. Following the battle, Nan Chen was blockaded into the port of Ningpo (now Ningbo) until the end of the war. She was absorbed into the Chinese navy following the Xinhai Revolution and was stricken in 1919. Design and description The unprotected cruisers were intended to be of relatively simple design compared to other Imperial Chinese Navy vessels on order from European shipyards at the time. They were similar to the cruiser , but constructed out of steel instead of wood. Both Nan Chen and her sister vessel, , were obsolete during construction; the Chinese navy had also commissioned armored and protected cruisers, such as . Nan Chen was long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . Zhiyuen displaced , and carried a crew of 250 officers and enlisted men. She was unarmored with the exception of a cork belt installed at the waterline of the ship. Unlike Kai Chi, on which the class was based, Nan Chen had two funnels instead of one. Both ships of the class were equipped with a naval ram, and had raised forecastles and poop decks. She was powered by a compound-expansion steam engine with eight boilers, driving a single shaft. This provided for a top speed of . Her initial armament consisted of two breach-loading Armstrong guns, alongside eight breach-loading Armstrong guns and some Hotchkiss guns. The two larger guns were mounted in sponsons ahead of the funnels, while the smaller Armstrongs were placed amidships as a broadside, on the forecastle and poop deck and in further sponsons ahead of the poop. Although the ship was launched in Germany, that armament was added by Armstrong Whitworth while Nan Chen was at its shipyard in Elswick, England. By 1884, she was equipped with a torpedo boat. Service history Two cruisers were ordered from Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, Kiel, Germany, in early 1883. At the time of the launch of Nan Chen 12 December 1883, the Germany authorities were preventing some of the Chinese construction from leaving the country such as the ironclads due to the impending Sino-French War. However, as she was sailing unarmed, Nan Chen was allowed to travel to England to have her guns installed. The British authorities then considered whether or not to allow the installation to take place, initially embargoing the vessel, but decided to permit it since she was obsolete compared to the French Navy. The British Government did refuse to allow Nan Chen to test fire her guns, which were not tested until she arrived in China on the Yangtze River in July 1884 just prior to the start of the war. Upon firing, they found that the ship needed to be strengthened to allow the guns to be fired at full charge. Both Nan Chen and her sister were sent to the Kiangnan Arsenal to be reinforced. Despite these issues, and their obsolescence, the German-built cruisers were held in high esteem by the Chinese authorities. =Sino-French War= After the start of the war in August 1884, Nan Chen and Nan Shui were sent to protect Nanking (now Nanjing) alongside Kai Chi. An attack was thought to be imminent, but the French Navy instead assaulted Formosa (now Taiwan) where they established a blockade. Chinese forces were gathered to drive off the blockade of the island, which comprised the two Nan Chen-class cruisers, Kai Chi, the frigate and the sloop-of-war . The squadron was under the command of Admiral Wu Ang-k'ang. The five ships gathered in Shanghai, leaving in December 1884. They took some time to work up their crews, and did not seek to engage the French immediately, only finally meeting them in the following February. The Chinese forces attached in a V-shaped formation, being led by Kai Chi as flagship. However, they immediately realised they were outgunned by the French forces and withdrew. While the slower Yuyuen and Teng Ching retreated into Shipu Bay after losing the three cruisers in the fog, which resulted in the Battle of Shipu. Nan Chen, Nan Shui and Kai Chi sailed north to the port of Ningpo (now Ningbo) where they were joined by the sloop-of-war and the transport . All five ships were then blockaded into the port by the French Navy squadron. While some exchanges of fire were conducted in March 1885, this was the last involvement of Nan Chen during the war. =Fate= During the First Sino- Japanese War, Nan Chen and Nan Shui were sent to the Taiwan strait for patrol duties. On 20 September 1894, Nan Chen captured the U.S. steamer Pathan, on suspicion of smuggling arms to Japan. Nan Chen continued to serve in the Chinese navy after the Xinhai Revolution. It was later used as a training vessel and was stricken in 1919.

The escape failed when the group's vessel MK I was detected and attacked by the German frigate R56. To escape, MK I was scuttled by its Norwegian crew by detonating explosives with a time delay fuse. The crew fled in a small boat, which was promptly sunk by the Germans. Eleven Norwegian soldiers from the Company Linge died; one was shot at the site, ten were captured, interrogated and tortured by the Gestapo and then executed in Troms√∏. Jan Baalsrud managed to escape from Rebbenes√∏ya to neutral Sweden; his three-month escape was made through Lyngen and Manndalen with the help of local villagers, during which he amputated nine toes to avoid the spread of gangrene.

The Gestapo officers who tortured and executed eight of the MK \\"Bratholm 1\\" crew were ordered in the late summer of 1945 to dig up the bodies from the mass grave at Gr√∏nn√•sen Skytebane, first with spades, then by hand, so as to not damage the bodies. They also had to wash the bodies before placing them in coffins. The prosecution after the war became problematic as the main target, Kurt Stage, was not in Norwegian custody. Stage was executed in 1947 in Slovenia for war crimes there; no criminal proceedings were brought against the four others who were charged in the case.Berit N√∏kleby War crimes ‚Äì Breach of the law of war in Norway 1940‚Äì45 (2004) Pax Forlag, s. 82‚Äì85.

He lives in London. Brunelli has published the following books of film noir and street photography black and white photographs: The Animals (2008 and 2016), Eternal London (2014), Self Portraits (2016) and New York (2020) . His work has been exhibited at The Barbican Centre, The Photographers' Gallery and The New Art Gallery Walsall in the UK and at Blue Sky Gallery in Portland, OR, USA. His work is held in the collections of The New Art Gallery Walsall, Portland Art Museum, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and Kiyosato Museum of Photographic Arts in Japan. Early life and education Brunelli was born on 21 May 1977 in Perugia, Italy. He grew up in the countryside and spent his childhood playing with animals. He graduated from university in Communications and took a six-month course in photojournalism in Rome where he had been living before moving to London. Art/photography Brunelli's medium is gelatin silver prints and he is a printer. He photographs with a Miranda Sensomat camera‚Äîa 35 mm SLR made in 1962 once belonged to his father, an amateur photographer. In a recent talk, he mentioned Italian Renaissance, Italian Medieval Art and street photography as his major influences. In 2016, Brunelli's image of the snarling dog was used in the movie The 9th Life of Louis Drax, directed by Alexandre Aja, during Jamie Dornan's hypnosis. =The Animals (2004‚Äì2008)= Brunelli has photographed \\"animals in the countryside, backyards, fields and farms since 2004\\" in Italy. He calls this series \\"animal-focused street photography\\". His film noir aesthetic makes them \\"seem singled out or stopped in their tracks\\". He gets as close as his camera will allow, which \\"forces the animals to either flight or fight,\\" at which point he photographs them. \\"It is all about capturing that moment of reaction, triggered through various approaches that vary from animal to animal. Whether it is ignoring them, running after them or using their natural curiosity for the shot.\\" In 2008, The New Art Gallery Walsall will present his first museum show and in the same year Dewi Lewis Publishing publish the series. =Eternal London (2012‚Äì2014)= In 2012, he was commissioned by The Photographers' Gallery in London to make the Eternal London series, which he worked on every day for two years creating a body of work between film noir, street photography and sculpture . The book was selected by Martin Parr and included in the \\"Strange and Familiar\\" exhibition at the Barbican Centre in London in 2017. =Self Portraits (2010‚Äì2013)= In the summer 2010, while searching for animals in Umbria, Brunelli noticed his shadow projected on a white road and decided to start the Self Portraits series, which it will be completed in 2013. Brunelli says that he took inspiration from Arte Povera. The project will be published in Paris by Editions Bessard in 2016. Again using his film noir style, the silhouettes of people and animals are set against well known London landmarks. After following a person he wishes to photograph, \\"working discreetly, Brunelli often uses a removable viewfinder, to be able to photograph his subjects from waist height and other unusual angles, such as directly from behind and with extreme close-up\\", obscuring their faces. He uses \\"light, shadow and contrast to imbue his images with a dramatic atmosphere and a feeling of claustrophobia.\\" In 2014 The Photographers' Gallery will exhibit the work in a solo show. =Hamburg (2015)= In 2015, Deichtorhallen museum commissioned Brunelli to work on the city of Hamburg and the series will be exhibited at Robert Morat Galerie. =New York City (2017‚Äì2019)= Between 2017 and 2019 he has produced his latest body of work to date on New York City, exhibited at The Photographers'Gallery in London in October 2019 and published in 2020 by Skinnerboox. =Venice (2020)= Brunelli is currently working in Venice (Italy) for a new project to be released later in the year.

It concerns a group of Navy SEALs who are captured and taken aboard an Iranian submarine from which they must escape to survive. The film was released straight-to-video.Steel Sharks Review RadioTimes. John Ferguson. Retrieved: 28/05/18 Several scenes involving Navy helicopter, ship, and command footage from this film were used in the production of Crash Dive, Freedom Strike, Counter Measures and Agent Red.IMDb Connections  Plot  A news report announces a revolution has overthrown the Iranian government. This coincides with the disappearance of an American UN chemical weapons inspector, Dr. John Van Tasset (Barry Livingston), in Iraq. The US is determined to stage a rescue in the fear that he will be used to develop weapons for the new Iranian government. A Navy SEAL team is recruited for the mission, but is down a member due to illness. The replacement, Bob Rodgers, (Billy Warlock), is a young SEAL fresh out of school. The SEAL team is flown out to an aircraft carrier group in the Persian Gulf, where they meet Admiral Jim Perry (Billy Dee Williams), who commands the fleet and the rescue mission. The SEAL team will be dispatched from a submarine to rescue the scientist from where he is being held in Iran. Upon arrival at the submarine, Cmdr. Bill McKay (Gary Busey) is introduced and the SEALs are quickly sent off to rescue Dr. Tasset. They stalk quietly through the Iranian compound killing everyone they meet. After rescuing Dr. Tasset from an interrogation, they try to sneak back to the US submarine but are discovered by a group of soldiers that alert the entire base. They get into a gun battle where one of the members of the team is killed and the others are ultimately captured. They are taken to a new secret Iranian submarine for safe keeping. On board the Iranian submarine, the leader of the SEAL team is taken to Captain Reza Lashgar (Shaun Toub) who shoots him despite the protests of others on the crew. The sonar technician aboard the US submarine detects the sound of gunshots and Cmdr. McKay begins to follow the Iranian submarine. At the same time the SEAL Team realizes they have to escape to survive and plan an ambush of the guards, which works flawlessly. They split up, one group to head straight to the escape hatch and the other to communicate their escape to the US submarine. Through this electronic communication, Cmdr. McKay is aware that the SEALs have escaped and begins to hunt the Iranian submarine to buy time. They are engaged multiple times by the submarine, but expertly evade their torpedoes. With the help of Bob Rodgers' lucky coin, both groups of SEALs are able to reach the escape hatch and leave the submarine. Cmdr. McKay deftly leads the Iranian submarine down a narrow canyon, resulting in Iranian submarine striking the canyon wall with a torpedo and being sunk by the falling debris. Enraged, Captain Lashgar blows the ballast and the Iranian submarine rises for one last attack. Knowing the SEALs are safe, Cmdr. McKay torpedoes the Iranian submarine, destroying it.

This shrimp, most commonly known as Rock-pool Shrimp (aka Red-handed Shrimp), is common as both juveniles and adults on shallow rocky reef in temperate marine southern Australia.In South Australia it (personal observation) is easily the most frequently observed shrimp for beachcombers looking into rock pools and snorkelers and divers in rocky areas from littoral zone down to at least 10 metres depth. Details of this species' morphology,lifecycle,ecology etc can be found elsewhere in the literature including ALA (Atlas of Living Australia).However at time of this edit there is little peer reviewed journal info on the important niche role P. serenus fills as a facultative (part-time) cleaning host of a wide variety of inshore fish that share similar habitat. This behaviour has been photographically documented for certain bony fish species , images of which can be seen on the MLSSA (Marine Life Society of South Australia Inc) website , the relevant Project link on the inaturalist.org database ,and is also readily accessible via National Geographic. Examples of client species that can often be observed, at certain *times of day and night (*such windows are thought to suit both host and client due factors including tide timelines, with associated low predation risk for host and client ,and limited availability of alternative food supplies for the host shrimps, coinciding with foraging 'down time ' for clients) being cleaned by these shrimps are Yelloweye Mullet, Common Weedfish and Smooth Toadfish. During the warmer months waders and snorkelers who have areas of exposed skin submerged, e.g. dangling their feet in a rock pool at low tide, often experience a usually painless 'pins and needles ' sensation on the submerged skin, which when the water is clear can be seen to be caused by numbers of these shrimp picking shed squames and probably sundry other things such as commensal dermatophytic 'parasites ' (mutualism ,strictly, not true parasites) normally present on the skin of healthy humans.

Inventions Born in 1820, Nicoll started his career in trade, becoming the owner of sanitary works, as well as an inventor and maker of patented appliances for the interception and deodorization of sewage, and the filtration of water. Further, he developed improvements to fire escapes, fog signals for vessels, and electric and telegraph conductors. In 1872, and in conjunction with Robert Sabine, ten miles of underground telegraph conductors were laid on a system he had secured a patent for. At the time of his death in 1891, he was also involved in bringing out a patent for paving roadways with hard Australian jarrah-wood, which he predicted to be cheap, clean and safe for horses. Political career Nicoll first stood for election was a Radical candidate at Frome at a by-election in 1854‚Äîcaused by the death of the sitting Whig Robert Edward Boyle. However, Nicoll was defeated by Boyle's son and the Whig candidate, Richard, by 52 votes. At another by-election in 1856‚Äîcaused by the succession of Richard Boyle to 9th Earl of Cork and Orrery‚ÄîNicoll sought the seat once more. He was this time defeated by Boyle's younger brother, William George Boyle, a Whig candidate, by just one vote. However, at the next general election in 1857, Nicoll successfully gained the seat, defeating Boyle and the Conservative candidate, Edward Thynne, with a majority of 70 votes, or 21.5%. However, standing as a Liberal in 1859, Nicoll was unseated by Thynne with a 34.8% swing against the Liberals. Works Nicoll was also the author of a number of books and pamphlets, including: * Health and its Appliances (1884) * Underground versus Overhead Wires (1887) * The Telegraph and Telephone, considered in relation to Economy and Efficiency (1887) Other activities Nicoll was involved in numerous areas of public life, and he was awarded for being so. He was the Sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1849, and became captain of the 29th North Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps in 1864. He was appointed Commissioner for the City of London to the 1867 Paris Exhibition, receiving a medal and an honourable mention for an exhibit showing the properties of bitumen as an insulating material. The 1872 Moscow Exhibition and 1873 Vienna Exhibition also awarded him medals. He also served as a Justice of the Peace for Middlesex and Westminster, chairman of the Poor Law Amendment Society, and a life governor of many London charitable institutions. He was a member of each of the Society of Arts, the Inventors' Institute, the Spectacle-makers' Company, and the united Grand Lodge of Freemasons. In 1884, he was elected an Associate of the Institution.

Studies have shown differences in epigenetic markers like DNA methylation, histone modifications and miRNA expression between smokers and non-smokers. Similar differences exist in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. These epigenetic effects are thought to be linked to many of negative health effects associated with smoking. Health impact It has been well established that smoking cigarettes has a number of negative health effects, including increased risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Children exposed prenatally to cigarette smoke demonstrate increased risk for fetal growth restriction, sudden infant death syndrome, and addictive behaviors later in life, as well as a host of other secondary health effects. It is thought that epigenetic changes that arise from smoking cigarettes or exposure to cigarette smoke play a role in the development of these conditions. Epigenetic modifications to the genome, including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and the modulation of RNAi, are major epigenetic events used to modulate gene expression. When the epigenome of an organism is altered by an environmental cue like smoking, gene expression changes accordingly. Changes in the regulation of critical genes can have disastrous consequences on health and quality of life. Irregular gene expression is one of the hallmarks of cancer, but is also found in a number of diseases and disorders. Mechanisms for changes in DNA methylation One of the most prominent and well studied epigenetic consequences of cigarette smoke is altered DNA methylation. Cigarette smoke acts through a number of mechanisms to effect this, chief among these being smoke induced damage to the DNA and altered expression levels of proteins involved in DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation. =Damage to DNA= Chemicals in smoke can damage DNA, which subsequently leads to changes in DNA methylation during the repair process. Damage typically comes in the form of double-strand breaks that are linked to carcinogens like arsenic, chromium, formaldehyde, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and nitrosamines which are found in cigarette smoke. DNMT1 is the enzyme involved in the maintenance of DNA methylation marks. DNMT1 is recruited to DNA during its replication, or during DNA repair. As a new DNA strand is synthesized, unmethylated cytosines are incorporated into the sequence. This leads to hemimethylated DNA, where an older methylated strand is bound to a younger unmethylated one. DNMT1 is an enzyme which recognizes and corrects hemimethylation by transferring the appropriate methyl groups to the newly synthesized strand. Like all biological processes, DNMT1 based hemimethylation correction is not perfect. Mistakes in hemimethylation correction can occur, and are more likely to appear the more a DNA sequence is replicated or repaired. This is compounded by the fact that cigarette smoke compromises the expression and activity of DNMT1. The end result is a decrease in the body's ability to maintain proper methylation patterns, leading to misexpression of genes. =Effects on DNA methylating proteins = Exposure to cigarette smoke impacts proteins involved in DNA methylation. These effects come from either hypoxia induced by the cigarette smoke, or the chemical consequences of nicotine. Inhaling cigarette smoke increases blood levels of carbon monoxide which negatively affects oxygenation throughout the body leading to hypoxia. One response to hypoxia is the upregulation in synthesis of the major methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine. Upregulation of this methyl donor through heightened expression of methionine adenosyltransferase 2A leads to increased DNA methylation, which can lead to the down-regulation of target genes. Nicotine found in cigarette smoke binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This binding leads to an increase in calcium levels which in turn can activate the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor. The most striking downstream effect of the upregulation of this transcription factor is the downregulation of the DNMT1 gene, which has a cAMP response element in its promoter. This down-regulation of DNMT1 can have serious consequences on DNA methylation, namely a failure to maintain normal methylation patterns during DNA replication and repair. The upregulation of DNMT3b has also been shown to occur as a result of cigarette exposure. DNMT3b is thought to be critical to de novo methylation, or the production of new methylation marks on DNA. This increased expression of DNMT3b and methionine adenosyltransferase 2A, taken together with the down-regulation of DNMT1, results in myriad unintended epigenetic consequences. =Effects on transcription factors= Sp1, a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in early development, was shown to be expressed at higher rates in lung epithelial cells in the presence of cigarette-smoke condensate. This is relevant because Sp1 binds to GC-rich promoter regions which prevent the methylation of these regions during embryonic development. Increased Sp1 expression can lead to a global reduction in DNA methylation, leading to a number of downstream health effects in developing embryos exposed to maternal cigarette smoke. Consequences of altered DNA methylation Regardless of mechanism, several known differences in DNA methylation have been observed between smokers and non-smokers. An overall average decrease in DNA methylation is observed, leading to an increase in the expression of a number of genes. Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the CYP1A1 xenobiotic response element, AHRR, and F2RL3. CYP1A1 is critical to the detoxification of carcinogens, and is found to be hypomethylated in frequent smokers. AHRR and F2RL3 are similarly hypomethylated in smokers. AHRR is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals. The resultant increase in AHRR expression could lead to a decrease in the body's ability to break down carcinogens, increasing the risk of cancer. F2RL3 is known to be involved in blood clotting and the inflammation response. Effects on the regulation of F2RL3 in particular could be a link between epigenetic changes from smoking and increased risk of heart disease. Time specific changes in methylation of D4Z4 and NBL2 repeats, which are known factors in carcinogenesis, have also been observed. Though smoking leads to an overall decrease in DNA methylation, several critical genes become hypermethylated. Two of the most noteworthy of these genes are p16 and p53. These genes are critical to cell cycle regulation and were shown to have higher levels of methylation in smokers than in non smokers. The subsequent loss of function of these genes could potentially lead to dysregulation of the cell cycle, wherein cells are able to bypass normal growth impeding signals. Ultimately, uncontrolled cellular divisions and failure to properly regulate the cell cycle leads to cancer. Fetuses exposed in utero to cigarette smoke are also known to have some distinct epigenetic differences from smoke-free cohorts. CYP1A1 was found to be hypomethylated in the placentas of fetuses prenatally exposed to cigarette smoke, along with the transposable element AluYB8. Methylation of transposable elements is one of the primary ways they are prevented from replicating or moving within the genome. Similarly observed hypomethylation in a number of Alu elements results in a general decrease in genomic stability and an increase in the risk of cancer from mutation resulting from the random insertion of transposable elements. Strikingly, BDNF appears to be hypermethylated in children who were exposed to smoke prenatally. BDNF is critical to long term memory formation and the upkeep of neurons. Downregulation of BDNF has also been linked to clinical depression. Taken as a whole, the epigentic consequences of prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke result in increased metabolic stress, decreased genomic stability, heightened risk of mutation and altered brain development. Effects on histone modifications Histone modifications are another epigenetic phenomenon known to be affected by smoking. Cigarette smoke has been observed to globally alter histone modifications near the promoter regions of pro-inflammatory genes, mainly through an overall increase in acetylation. Cigarette smoke can alter histone acetylation through a number of pathways. Chief among these is the degradation of HDAC2, thereby preventing the removal of acetylation marks in affected cells. The degradation of this enzyme results from phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination induced by cigarette smoke. In rat and mouse models, cigarette smoke was observed to increase acetylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9), lysine 12 on histone H4 (H4K12) and phosphorylation of serine 10 on histone H3 (H3S10). These marks are associated with an increase in gene expression and prevent the accumulation of repressive histone modifications. Mechanistically, the increased frequency of these marks, especially the modifications on histone H3, are linked to the activation of IKK-Œ± which directly phosphorylates histone H3 as a consequence of exposure to cigarette smoke. It is thought that this increase in acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in macrophages in the alveolus could potentially lead to the development of COPD. Effects on miRNA MicroRNAs, or miRNAs, are known to be major epigenetic regulators of gene expression in humans. These RNAs are short molecules which bind to mRNA through complementary base pairing. This binding impacts the expression of proteins encoded by those mRNAs by either inducing the cleavage of the mRNA, destabilizing the molecule, or limiting the efficiency of its translation. Unlike differences in DNA methylation, changes in miRNA activity induced by cigarette smoke are largely unknown. Primary research data suggests that cigarette smoke promotes the dysregulation of a number of miRNA's. One such study showed that cigarette smoke downregulates miR-16, miR-21, and miR-146a in the placenta. A downregulation of miR-16 is predicted to inhibit apoptosis via the subsequent upregulation of BCL2L2 and EDA, both of which contribute to anti-apoptotic signaling. Downregulaton of miR-146a is predicted to influence the expression of TRAF6, which has a number of downstream effects, including regulation of inflammatory responses and anti-apoptotic signaling. Taken as a whole, dysregulation of these miRNA's could lead to dysregulation of normal cell death, cell cycling and immune responses, all of which have negative health impacts and could potentially lead to cancerous growths and improper placental formation.

By the late 1920s interest in public education grew in Walker and the surrounding areas, so the school district proposed the sale of bonds to finance the construction of a new school. After initially failing in April 1928, the district expanded and in August 1928 the proposal passed with 73 in favor and 65 against. Construction on the school was completed by 1930. The school was a two-story brick building with concrete trim that featured Italian Renaissance and Italian Baroque motifs. When the school opened in January 1931, it was realized that money for educational equipment was lacking, so the voters in the district passed another measure leading to an additional property tax. This consistent effort by the citizens showed their desire for a proper education system, and allowed for the older rural schools to close and the schools consolidated their students to one location. Livingston Parish Public Schools desegregated following the 1969 case Dunn v. Livingston Parish School Board.United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. Dunn v. Livingston Parish School Board. 14 Aug. 1970. Open Jurist. The effects of desegregation were larger for Denham Springs High School because Denham Springs was the largest city in the parish. Prior to desegregating, Livingston Parish only had one school for African Americans called West Livingston. As a result, black students were bussed from all over the parish to attend school. Because there was a large Ku Klux Klan presence in Livingston Parish, there was not a large African American population outside of the City of Denham Springs. Those who did attend Walker High School following integration likely faced harsh treatment from their peers. By 1975, the City of Walker outgrew the building that was once Walker High School and moved to its current location. The building that was once Walker High School was converted into a junior high and now serves as Walker Freshman High School. It was also placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 3, 2000.  National Register of Historic Places  The school was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 3, 2000.

Burk and construction was awarded to R.L. Roland & Son. Was first constructed to act as city hall. Later the holding cells of the town hall were expanded and remodeled into a small prison after the original prison ran out of housing space this adjust was only as a temporary relief function due to budget cuts in the prison system.

On the surface, the hill had construction stones with ostensible foundations on a ground that, at first glance, was seen to be unnatural. View of the hill Its location, isolation and steep relief gives the place a strategic nature and privileged natural defense, suitable for settlement of human groups. The research campaigns that regularly carried out on the site, since 1980, revealed a series of consecutive phases in the occupation of the hill. The first phase of settlement would be characterized by the existence of a large quantity of flint carving remains and few ceramic fragments. Its chronology would be doubtful. The second, best documented corresponds to the main time of habitat use, in full development of the Bronze Age in the Meseta Central. The third marks the final phase of the habitat of the aforementioned Bronze Age. In these last two phases, from which habitation structures and cottages and even homes \\"in situ\\" have been discovered, an eminently pastoral economy was developed, with the primacy of cattle sheep and bovine. Later there was a medieval settlement, Arab, small and provisional, that responded to a strategic and military conception. From this stage remains are preserved on the top of the hill.

Modeste Chambay, 1877. Robert Emile Sigismond L√©on Proust (24 May 1873 ‚Äì 29 May 1935) was a French urologist and gynaecologist and the younger brother of the writer Marcel Proust. Both brothers had an early education at the Lyc√©e Condorcet, with Robert Proust going on to study medicine. An active supporter of his brother's writing career, and following Marcel's early death, he arranged for publication of the final three volumes of Marcel's novel √Ä la recherche du temps perdu. He published a landmark medical paper on perineal prostatectomy, \\"De la prostatectomie p√©rin√©ale totale\\", following which his colleagues nicknamed his prostate procedure a \\"proustatectomie\\". In addition, his interest in gynaecology led to his publication of multiple editions of Chirurgie de l'appareil g√©nital de la femme, a gynaecology textbook. Amongst other accomplishments, Proust served as a military surgeon during the First World War where he devised a form of mobile operating theatre called the \\"auto-chir\\", which could be moved close to the front, and was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1925. Proust died 1935 and the H√¥pital Tenon in Paris honours him with the \\"Pavillon Proust\\". Early life and family Caricature of Robert Proust. A. Chanteau, 1922. Robert Proust was born in Paris on 24 May 1873 to Adrien Proust, an eminent physician in the field of public health who helped eliminate cholera from Europe, and his wife Jeanne Weil, a Jewish woman who was fifteen years younger than her husband. He was educated with his brother Marcel, who was two years older than Robert, at the Lyc√©e Condorcet. He subsequently attended the University of Paris where his performance was considered \\"outstanding\\". Relationship with his brother Proust and his brother had an affectionate relationship from childhood. When Robert was seven, he saw Marcel's first asthma attack and it had a profound effect upon him. Marcel developed a close attachment to their mother, whereas Robert followed in their father's footsteps in the medical tradition. Robert was an active supporter of his brother's writing career, and following Marcel's early death, he edited and arranged the final three volumes of his brother's novel √Ä la recherche du temps perdu for publication. Both brothers were supporters of the unjustly accused French army captain, Alfred Dreyfus. Career Proust started his internships in 1894 under the supervision of F√©lix Guyon, who also oversaw the publication in 1900 of Proust's landmark medical paper on perineal prostatectomy, \\"De la prostatectomie p√©rin√©ale totale\\". Proust's peers nicknamed his prostate procedure a \\"proustatectomie\\". A frequent complication to prostatectomy was epididymitis. In 1904, Proust had recommended vasectomy at the time of prostatectomy. In addition to general surgery and urology, Proust had a special interest in gynaecology and his book Chirurgie de l'appareil g√©nital de la femme (The surgery of the female genital tract) (1904) had six editions by 1927. He studied male (andrology) and female (gynaecology) reproductive tracts, whilst he was Samuel Jean de Pozzi's assistant at H√¥pital Broca between 1904 and 1914. He collaborated with Pozzi in his specialism of hermaphrodites and they published a number of articles on the subject together. At the recommendation of Pozzi, Proust made frequent educational journeys to the Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins Hospital. Proust was director of the Br√¥ca himself from 1932 to 1934. One of his pupils was the future transplant surgeon Ren√© K√ºss. Proust had a profound interest in the accomplishments of Marie Curie and added a section on \\"curieth√©rapie\\" in the fifth edition of his book, when completing his writings on radiothiotherapy of cervical cancer. Prior to the introduction of external beam radiotherapy, he recommended intravaginal radium rods and intra-abdominal radium applied locally (via laparotomy) to affected lymph nodes. First World War Proust served at the front as a military surgeon during the First World War. He devised a form of mobile operating theatre called the \\"auto-chir\\", which could be moved close to the front.

He later entered politics in Strasbourg, became mayor, and played a significant role in the decision of the city leaders to surrender to the Germans in 1870 following the Siege of Strasbourg in the Franco-Prussian War. Early life and family √âmile K√ºss was born in 1815 into \\"an ancient bourgeois family\\" of Strasbourg.Quoted in Rachel Chrastil. (2014) The Siege of Strasbourg. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. p. 178. He was educated at the Protestant Gymnasium in Strasbourg and studied anatomy.Chrastil, pp. 178‚Äì179. A grandson of his nephew Edouard K√ºss, son of his brother Th√©odore, was the surgeon Ren√© K√ºss.Dictionnaire de biographie alsacienne, volume 22 (Koe-Lag), pages 2135-2137, published by F√©d√©ration des Soci√©t√©s d'Histoire et d'Arch√©ologie d'Alsace, in 1994, Strasbourg, France.K√ºss family genealogy on Geneanet, by Maurice Dominique Kirchner. Medical career K√ºss was appointed head of anatomical studies at the University of Strasbourg in 1843 and professor of physiology in 1846. His large family meant that he always needed money and he lectured regularly and gave classes on anatomical drawing despite a pulmonary infection that meant he was sometimes bedridden. =Cancer research= The cell theory of Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann (1838/39) generated a debate about the behaviour of cancer cells, the use of the microscope, and its relevance to cancer diagnosis. Not all pathologists believed that cancer cells were distinctive or that cancer could be diagnosed by looking at a collection of cells (histology) rather than individual cells (cytology). The definition of cancer did not incorporate its morphological features until many years later. It had instead relied on looking solely at the spread of the cancer, that is, its \\"ability to invade locally and metastasize\\". √âmile K√ºss and Charles-Emmanuel S√©dillot were amongst the few who believed that cancer cells could be recognised by how they looked under the microscope, as described by Adolph Hannover in 1843. They published their research on microscopic diagnosis in Recherches sur le cancer in 1846 and by 1847 they were performing punch biopsies of tumours using a specially designed instrument, as described by K√ºss: > On plunging this instrument into a tumor to any depth, we can extract a > minute portion of the tissue of which its various layers are composed. In > this manner a microscopic examination of the tumor can be practiced on the > living subject, and its nature ascertained before having recourse to an > operation. They have been described as pioneers in histopathology, and according to pathologist and historian James R. Wright, carried out \\"the first surgical biopsies, predating Carl Ruge, generally considered the father of biopsy, by more than 30 years.\\" Politics K√ºss was a committed republican who opposed the Second Republic (1848‚Äì1852) of Napoleon III and twice refused the Legion of Honor. He was a leading figure locally in the 1848 June revolution. Along with many others, he was arrested when Bonaparte overturned the Second Republic in December 1851, but was acquitted of all charges by a court in Metz. He re-entered politics in 1869 to campaign for Charles Boersch who later became prefect of Strasbourg while he was mayor, and in 1870 he argued against Napoleon III's plebiscite. He was idolised by young republicans in the city for his uncompromising approach to the Empire. K√ºss became mayor of Strasbourg on 14 September 1870 and soon after argued that the city should surrender to the Germans following the Siege of Strasbourg in the Franco-Prussian War to save life and because the situation was hopeless.Chrastil, pp. 180‚Äì182.

Early life She was born, one of five children, in Rusholme, Manchester. In 1930 she married Arthur W Lightfoot in Manchester and is believed to have worked in a hairdressing business in the Chorlton area. She was also a registered nurse. In 1937 she arrived in Spain during the Spanish Civil War and worked with the International Brigade as head nurse in a monastery near Ucles in Castile. At the end of the war in 1939 she was rounded up as a foreigner and imprisoned, but eventually allowed to leave after a petition by the English government. Second World War OBE medal She was then married a second time, to Norwegian businessman Wilhelm Holst, whom she had met in Spain. They joined the Special Operations Executive and made their way to Marseilles to work for MI9, a department of the British War Office. Marguerite was involved in setting up the \\"Garrow-O'Leary\\" escape line with Ian Garrow and Pat O'Leary. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in January 1946. The citation reads: \\"Mrs. Holst was in Paris, where her Norwegian husband [Wilhelm Holst] was engaged on relief work, when the Germans broke through in 1940, and subsequently moved from there to Marseilles. Here she got in touch with Captain Garrow, who had organised the first British escape route from France to Spain. At this time Garrow was living in Marseilles and it was necessary for his work that he should avoid contact with the French police. In this he was greatly helped by Mrs. Holst, who sheltered him and helped financially. Thanks to various other contacts of Mrs. Holst, Garrow was able to expand his organisation considerably. Mrs. Holst also assisted Lieutenant- Commander O‚ÄôLeary on his arrival in France to work with Garrow. On the latter‚Äôs arrest, Mrs. Holst maintained contact with him in prison and sent his food. In the Spring of 1941, Mrs. Holst visited Lisbon with her husband and brought important information from the organisation. On subsequent trips, travelling as a Norwegian subject, she was obliged to fly by German civil aircraft, carrying information sewn in the lining of her coat. During one of her visits to Lisbon, Mrs. Holst was taught the use of secret inks for communication by post, and by this method continued to send from France regular despatches regarding the escape organisation. Demonstrating great coolness and bravery in conducting her dangerous work, Mrs. Holst never hesitated to undertake any task assigned to her. An English woman operating in enemy-occupied territory, she fully understood what would be the penalty if she was discovered. It was largely thanks to her that the original ‚ÄúGarrow-O‚ÄôLeary‚Äù organisation was able to get established in Southern France, whereby several hundred escapers from Dunkirk days were enabled to return to the United Kingdom.\\" Later life After the war she was married a third time, to Thorkil A. D. Hansen in London in 1955. She died as Marguerite Hansen in Hendon in 1970. Thorkil had died in 1966.

Official Badge of National Safety Month 2018 During National Safety Month, individuals and organizations participate by making efforts to reduce the leading causes of unintentional injury and death at work, on the road, and in homes and communities.  History  In 1996, the National Safety Council established June as National Safety Month, aiming to increase awareness of the leading safety and health risks and ultimately decrease the number of unintentional injuries and deaths in the United States. Wrigley Building in Chicago lit up green for National Safety Month in 2017 In 2017, several buildings in the city of Chicago lit their building lights green to show their support for National Safety Month.  National Safety Month 2018  The theme for National Safety Month in June 2018 is \\"No 1 Gets Hurt.\\" Each week in June correlates with a different safety topic: = Week 1 - Emergency Preparedness = Federal agencies, like Ready.gov, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provide resources for emergency preparedness. Some 10,000 cardiac arrests occur each year in the workplace. Only 45% of American workers have had first aid training and only 50 percent know where to locate an automated external defibrillator. = Week 2 - Wellness = The Institute of Medicine estimates that 50-70 million Americans chronically suffer from a sleep disorder. For an individual, sleep disorders can have a substantial impact in reducing quality of life, increasing the risk of other health problems such as heart disease and diabetes, and even reducing lifespan. = Week 3 - Falls = Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death for adults age 65 and older. Falls are also the leading cause of death in construction according to OSHA. = Week 4 - Driving = Drowsy driving contributes to about 10 percent of all motor vehicle-related crashes, exceeding federal estimates by nearly eightfold, according to newly released research from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.  National Safety Month 2017  The theme for National Safety Month in June 2017 was \\"Keep Each Other Safe,\\" which underscored the role every individual plays in the effort to eliminate preventable deaths. Each week in June correlated with a different safety topic: = Week 1 - Stand Up to Falls = One in three older adults falls each year. About 2.5 million nonfatal falls were treated in emergency departments in 2013. = Week 2 - Recharge to Be in Charge = More than 70 million Americans suffer from sleep problems, according to research from the National Institutes of Health. Sleep disorders, like sleep apnea, can be serious enough to interfere with an employee's well- being. Approximately 13% of work injuries could be attributed to sleep problems. = Week 3 - Prepare for Active Shooters = An average of 70 people were wounded and 46 killed per year in active shooter events between 2014 and 2015. = Week 4 - Don't Just Sit There = Overexertion continues to be a leading cause of injury over all age groups. It was the second leading reason that adults age 25-64 ended up in emergency departments in 2013, and the third leading cause for kids ages 10 and older, often from too-heavy backpacks, computers and gaming, and poor posture.  Light Your City's Skyline Green  USG building of Chicago lit green for National Safety Month 2017 In 2017, the Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago (BOMA) approved the Council's lighting request, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois building, Prudential Plaza and The Wrigley Building, 400-410 North Michigan Ave., Chicago, Ill., were lit green in June to show support for National Safety Month.

Specializing in the use of micropaleontology to study marine geology, she was one of the first female scientists to be permitted to conduct fieldwork by the Geological Survey of Canada, and in 1973 was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society in recognition of her achievements and scientific research. Early life and education Born on 28 May 1927 in Hamilton, Ontario, Wagner was the daughter of Muriel (n√©e Konkle) and Harold Wagner. She had one younger brother, David, with whom she spent many hours of her youth exploring the flora, fauna and geology of the Canadian Shield around her family's Muskoka vacation cottage on Mary Lake. In addition to exploration of the natural environment, Wagner's love of the outdoors also meant she became an accomplished canoeist, long distance swimmer, and horsewoman. Wagner graduated with a BA degree from the University of Toronto in 1948, having specialized in paleontology, and remained at the same institution to complete an MA in invertebrate paleontology in 1950. Her research work for this higher degree focused on the stratigraphy and fauna of an Ordovician limestone sequence within a small quarry to the northeast of Ottawa. During the middle summer of her MA studies, in 1949, Wagner was employed by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) to catalogue samples at the Victoria Museum in Ottawa, and she began work full-time with the GSC on her 23rd birthday in May 1950. After a year in the field, she went to Stanford University where she earned her doctorate in Pleistocene paleontology. Her PhD, completed in 1954, focused on micropaleontology. Research career At the time of her hiring by the GSC, Wagner was one of only three female research scientists working within the survey, alongside fellow paleontologist Alice Wilson, and sedimentologist and oil field geologist Helen Belyea; Wilson was instrumental in bringing Wagner into the organization. Personal life Frances Wagner died at the age of 89, on 8 November 2016 in Falmouth, Nova Scotia.

In addition to his art practice, Carswell has taught and lectured on art and opened and operated a successful restaurant in Chicago.  Life and career  Rodney Carswell was born in Carmel, California in 1946 and raised in Santa Fe, New Mexico. After completing high school at the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, he studied art at the University of New Mexico (UNM) with professors John Pearson, Van Deren Coke and Garo Antresian, earning a BFA in 1968. After graduating, Carswell married Renee Dubois, traveled in Europe, and then enrolled in the MFA program at the University of Colorado Boulder, where he worked with professors George Woodman and Roland Reiss, and received an MFA in 1972. Following graduate study, Carswell began teaching at Illinois State University (1972‚Äì1980) and exhibiting throughout the Midwest. He was selected for the Art Institute of Chicago's prestigious \\"Chicago and Vicinity\\" show in 1973 and later picked up by Roy Boyd Gallery.The Art Institute of Chicago.

Ultimately, he felt a greater kinship with artists identified as post- minimalists, such as Eva Hesse, Jackie Winsor, Nancy Graves and Joel Shapiro, preferring their idiosyncratic styles of abstraction and engagement with the body, the hand-crafted and process over minimalism's embrace of non- referentiality and the mechanical.Stone, Andree. \\"Content of Abstraction,\\" exhibition essay, Chicago: Illinois Art Gallery, 1995.University of Oklahoma Museum of Art. \\"Rodney Carswell,\\" catalogue, University of Oklahoma Museum of Art, 1988.

The idea is to have the nature of the material and the act performed on the material both be evident in the object that results.\\" In his early work, this often took the form of what some critics called \\"irreverent constructions,\\" such as Martha (1977): painted fields of unstretched canvas that Carswell cut into geometric sail-like forms and attached directly to walls. Although abstract, these works were intended in their scale and positioning close to the floor to suggest a figural presence or \\"echo\\" of the viewer.Artner, Alan G. \\"Rodney Carswell Continues To Enlarge On Abstraction,\\" Chicago Tribune, January 19, 1995.

By the late-1980s, he achieved his mature style in works like Black and White Cross Encircled by Red (1988), employing a spare lexicon of emblematic forms (crosses, semicircles, squares, rectangles), thick exposed supports, interlocking planes and shaped or assembled canvasses, that he painted in vivid, unmodulated colors with rich, layered surfaces.Kirshner, Judith Russi. \\"Surfaces: Two Decades in Chicago Painting, Seventies and Eighties,\\" Surfaces: Two Decades in Chicago Painting, Seventies and Eighties, Chicago: Terra Museum of American Art, 1987.

Carswell described these works as \\"integrated pictorial objects [...] at once physical and logical, ephemeral and phenomenal.\\" Critics, such as Judith Russi Kirshner, have frequently commented on this sense of in-between spaces and paradoxes in Carswell's work of this period, for example, calling it \\"an ambiguous balance of object and image,\\" or in curator Terrie Sultan's case, identifying a \\"call-and-response\\" between accidental painted effects and deliberate, geometric compositional strategies. Others noted the push-and-pull between the arresting, unitary gestalt of iconic geometry and the seductive, almost decorative surfaces. Artforum's James Yood suggested that Carswell's \\"wry sequences of subtle dislocation\\" skewed his geometric abstract language just enough to keep his compositions \\"tense and expectant.\\"Yood, James, \\"Rodney Carswell at Roy Boyd,\\" Artforum, April 1992.

Critic Craig Adcock attributed a sense of \\"contingency and irresolution\\" in Carswell's work in his postmodernist recombining of Suprematist and Constructivist vocabularies, which allowed for complex allusions to familiar corporeal and architectural issues, as well as to art historical references, such as da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. He identified in the work \\"a search for essences\\" he found as much mathematical as allegorical. Buzz Spector noted allusions to \\"the spiritual geometries\\" of icons or the retablos of Carswell's native American Southwest, creating a \\"dialogue between spirituality and pragmatism\\" that seemed to quest for meaning while also demonstrating a formal‚Äîbut not ironic‚Äîskepticism of modernist utopias and traditional spirituality. Rodney Carswell, Untitled (February 12), india ink and gouache on Arches paper, 40\\" x 35\\", 2018. In his post-2002 paintings, Carswell has sought a greater sense of immediacy, leaving behind the superstructures and scale of past works and taking a speculative and exploratory approach to \\"incorporate more surprise and imaginative play.\\" Although still abstract, image and representation have become more apparent, and works like Jan 19 (09) (2009) have become less geometric and more expressive in terms of gesture, modulation, and color.

It is a pedestrian-only, tree-shaded public space. In 2011, the boulevard of Sabana Grande went through a rehabilitation process founded by PDVSA La Estancia. A commercial and financial district, Sabana Grande is the commercial corridor, and a tourist district of Caracas. The boulevard of Sabana Grande is home to the most important ornithological collection in Latin America, the William Phelps Ornithological Collection.acfiman.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/39.pdf Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was called Calle Real (Royal Street) because it was the town's main road. History Sabana Grande at night (2017) The boulevard of Sabana Grande was built on what was previously known as Abraham Lincoln Avenue. The land was ideal for the construction of the Caracas Metro. As early as 1968, El Nacional suggested that the fate of Abraham Lincoln Avenue was to remove cars from the street and turn it over to pedestrians. Sabana Grande is the location of the main connections of the Caracas Metro system and has three stations: Plaza Venezuela, Sabana Grande and Chaca√≠to. The Boulevard of Sabana Grande extends from the Los Andes Building to Quebrada Chaca√≠to, where Chacao municipality begins. Following the subway project in Caracas, whose construction began in 1975, more Caraque√±os began to arrive at Sabana Grande. Following the problems between Caracas Metro and Libertador municipality of Caracas over who had responsibility for it, the boulevard of Sabana Grande was not maintained in the 1990s, but then re-emerged through a series of changes that were applied. In 1994, the Caracas Metro finally granted the administration of the boulevard to the Libertador municipality. In 2007, based on its historical value, the Venezuelan government commissioned its recovery to PDVSA and the Libertador municipality.El boulevard de Sabana Grandehttp://oceandrive.com.ve/shot-on-site/balu-continua-apostando-por-la- moda-en-venezuela/ Culture alt= The boulevard of Sabana Grande was recently restructured. This commercial corridor has places and buildings of high historical, cultural and patrimonial value, icons of the modern architecture of twentieth century Venezuelan. PDVSA Centro de Arte La Estancia, in the process of renovating the boulevard in 2011, identified a total of nine heritage properties in the second section of the pedestrian promenade. The boulevard of Sabana Grande houses a number of important artworks. PDVSA La Estancia tried in Sabana Grande to connect art with the public spaces of Caracas. In Sabana Grande some sculptures have been removed and new ones have been added in recent years. The artwork Volumen by Francisco Narv√°ez was not located in Sabana Grande at the time of its rehabilitation but was later included in the urban and artistic furniture of the place. The registration of all the properties has not been carried out and it is necessary to perform an exhaustive investigation to determine who the architects were of all the important buildings on Sabana Grande. As of 2019, the designer of the who Araure Building located on the boulevard was unknown, even though it was declared part of the Architectural Heritage of Caracas. Most of the architectural heritage of Sabana Grande dates back to the twentieth century, although some buildings from the nineteenth century stand out, such as the Immaculate Conception Church of the Recreo.

Early Life and Education  Haynes was born and raised in St. Louis. She received her B.S. in biology from Florida A&M; University in 1999 . While at Florida A&M;, she participated in a summer research program working with Mary-Lou Pardue at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as part of the MIT Summer Research Program. Haynes did her graduate work in the lab of Sarah Elgin at Washington University in St. Louis. She received her Ph.D. in molecular genetics in 2006 for her work studying chromatin dynamics and epigenetics in Drosophila. As a Howard Hughes Medical Institute fellow, she completed her first postdoctoral fellowship in teaching at Davidson College under the guidance of Laurie Heyer and Malcolm Cambell. During her time as a fellow, Haynes redesigned the undergraduate bioinformatics teaching course and won publication of the year from the Journal of Biological Engineering for her article Engineering bacteria to solve the Burnt Pancake Problem. She was introduced to synthetic biology and became involved with the 2006 Davidson IGEM team. Haynes went on to complete a second postdoctoral fellowship in Pamela Silver's lab at Harvard Medical School where she leveraged her experience with chromatin dynamics and synthetic biology to create artificial transcription factors which activated genes based on histone methylation.  Academic Career and Research  After her postdoctoral fellowships in 2011, Haynes started her lab in the School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering at Arizona State University (ASU). There, her lab focused on creating epigenetic machinery that can regulate DNA. The proteins themselves are fusion transcription factors, which can target particular genes. She hopes to increase the use of technology in therapeutics, working on tissue regeneration and customizable protein-based drugs. In 2015 she was awarded a K01 grant to study the use of modular peptide motifs to build synthetic chromatin proteins that activate dormant therapeutic genes. During her time at ASU, she was the faculty advisor for the ASU iGEM team. In 2018, Haynes moved to the W.H. Coulter Biomedical Engineering Department at Georgia Tech/Emory University. During her time here, she founded the AfroBiotech conference and the Cold Spring Harbor Summer Course on Synthetic Biology. She was on the responsible conduct committee for IGEM in 2018 and 2019.

The country is surrounded by the Carpathians, Alps and Dinarides, but for the most part lowlands dominate the country. Sixty-eight percent of the country is lowlands below 200 meters altitude. Hilly terrain covers 30% of the country, while mountains cover only 2%. The entire Pannonian Basin is in the Danube watershed.Haas, J√°nos (2012). Geology of Hungary. Berlin: Springer Tectonics and bedrock geology Hungary is mostly defined by Late Cenozoic geologic evolution. Large back-arc basins formed due to anomalous crust thinning and a high geothermal gradient. The Pannonian Basin is actually system of basins, including the Great Plain Basin, the Vienna Basin, the Drava Basin and the Transylvanian Basin. The different sub-basins are separated by inselberg ranges, made of Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Paleogene sedimentary rocks as well as Cenozoic igneous and sedimentary rocks. The Eastern Alps extend into the northwest of Hungary as the Sopron and K≈ëszeg mountains, near the Austrian border and are made up of metamorphosed Paleozoic and Mesozoic rock sequences. The Transdanubian Range spans 250 kilometers, including hills and mountains. To the north of Lake Balaton, in the Balaton Highland, geologists have found Lower Paleozoic phyllite and carbonates. Northeast of Lake Balaton, in the Velence Hills, Carboniferous granite is most common. Triassic carbonates make up other parts of the Transdanubian mountains, although a small area of Jurassic, Cretaceous and Paleogene rocks are found in the central zone of the synform and control the basic structure of the mountains. The North Hungarian Mountains have very complicated geology. Paleozoic slate and carbonate are found in the Szendor and Uppony Hills, while the B√ºkk mountains are slightly metamorphosed Upper Paleozoic and Jurassic sedimentary and igneous rocks. A few Carboniferous granites are located in the southeast of the Mecsek mountains. Sediments and stratigraphy Layers of crinoidal limestone, formed during the Mesozoic Era, in Tata Lakes, rivers and river deltas left behind sediments in the basins between one kilometer and eight kilometer thick during the Late Miocene into the Pliocene, as the Pannonian Lake dominated the landscape. These sediments were covered over in the Quaternary by alluvial deposits, wind-blown sand and loess, which now makes up the surface of the Pannonian Plain. History of geologic research Beudant, a professor at the University of Paris published the first writings about Hungarian geology in 1822. The Imperial and Royal Geological Survey of the Austro-Hungarian Empire conducted geologic mapping in Hungary between 1850 and 1865, and published maps between 1867 and 1871. The Royal Hungarian Geological Survey took over mapping after its creation in 1869. Widespread drilling for thousands of artesian wells and 500 thermal wells expanded geologic knowledge in the second half of the 19th century. Hungarian physicist and geophysicist, Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s carried out gravity measurements using the torsion balance technique, helping to launch geophysics. After his death, students named the Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s Geophysical Institute in his honor. By World War II independent Hungary had five active university geology departments. Mapping increased after the war, with a growing staff at the Geological Survey and a new map was released in 1956. Understanding of Hungarian geology changed with the introduction of plate tectonics theories in the 1970s, which changed views on the formation of the Pannonian Basin. Natural resource geology At the time of the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary was rich in minerals, but most of these resources are now outside of Hungary's borders in the Slovak Ore Mountains and the Apuseni Mountains. Today, Hungary is poor in natural resources. After the 1989 revolution, bauxite mining virtually ended and coal production dropped. Power plants still do local strip mining for lignite and oil and gas are important resources. Historically, bauxite was sometimes known as \\"Hungarian silver,\\" due to large deposits of bauxite near Lake Balaton. As surface resource were depleted, mining went underground, lowering the karst water table. Bauxites formed in tropical climates in the Barremian age of the Early Cretaceous. Like Jamaican bauxites, heavy tropical rainfall stripped away other minerals draining into the porous underlying karst and creating sediments enriched in aluminum.Trunko, Laszlo (1996).

She showed very good form as a juvenile when she won two races and finished third in the Grand Crit√©rium. In the following year she was sent to England where she won the 1000 Guineas and looked unlucky when finishing third in Epsom Oaks. She also finished second in the Prix du Pr√©sident de la R√©publique and the Prix de La Jonchere and ran fifth in the Grand Prix de Paris. She made a very promising start to her time as a broodmare before dying at the age of nine. Background Mesa was a \\"plain\\" bay mare bred by Pierre Corbiere at his Nonant-le-Pin stud in France and was leased to Pierre Wertheimer during her racing career. She was trained at Chantilly in France by Albert Swann. She was sired by the Irish stallion Kircubbin who won the Irish St Leger as a three- year-old before being sent to France where he won the Prix d'Ispahan and the Prix du Pr√©sident de la R√©publique. He was the Leading sire in France in 1930. Mesa's dam Mackwiller was a top-class racehorse who won the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches in 1926. Apart from Mesa she produced the influential broodmares Mammee (female-line ancestor of Vimy and Ma Biche) and Muscida (ancestor of Classic Park and Court Masterpiece). Racing career =1934: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old Mesa won a minor race and then took the valuable Poule des Foals over 1400 metres at Deauville Racecourse. In autumn he was matched against male opposition in France' most prestigious juvenile race, the Grand Crit√©rium over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and finished third behind Pampeiro and Corrida. On her other start he ran second to Tulifer in the Poule de Deux Ans. =1935: three-year-old season= Mesa began her second campaign in the Prix de La Jonchere over 1400 metres in 22 April and came home second, beaten a short by seven-year-old Jus de Raisin. On 3 May the filly was sent to England for the 122nd runner of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse, in which he was ridden by Rae Johnstone and started at odds of 8/1 in a twenty-two runner field. The Queen Mary Stakes winner Caretta started favourite while the other fancied runners included Corrida, Lair, Annabel and Ankaret. Mesa won by three lengths from Hyndford Bridge with Caretta one and a half lengths back in third. Mesa was moved up in distance to contest the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse and started the 5/4 favourite. She was again partnered by Rae Johnstone, despite the jockey having received a seven-day suspension while riding in France. She finished third to Quashed and Ankaret, beaten just over a length by the winner, but looked an unlucky loser, making up almost ten lengths in the closing stages after failing to obtain a clear run until the final furlong. Johnstone was widely adjudged to have ridden a poor race, having elected to make his challenge on the inside through the thick of the field. In the Grand Prix de Paris on 30 June she ran well but finished fifth of the twenty-two runners behind the upset winner Crudit√©. On her final racecourse appearance in the Prix du Pr√©sident de la R√©publique at Saint-Cloud Racecourse a week later Mesa took the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished second to Louqsor. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Mesa an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Breeding record In 1936 Mesa was bought by Sir Malcolm McAlpine and retired to become a broodmare. She produced at least three foals before dying of a \\"twisted gut\\" in 1941. Her foals were: *Historic, a bay colt, foaled in 1939, sired by Solario. Won six races, second in the Jockey Club Cup. *Solesa, bay filly, 1940, by Solario. Won one race.

She is known for her work on the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway. Early life and education Palmer was born in Sheffield on 8 May 1967, the only child of Enid (n√©e Wilson) and Roy Palmer (a steelworker). Palmer was brought up in the steel town of Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire where she attended Stocksbridge High School. Palmer attended the University of Birmingham where she was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in biochemistry in 1988 followed by a PhD in 1992 for research investigating the enzyme kinetics of the proton pumping transhydrogenase from photosynthetic bacteria. She was inspired by the work of Peter D. Mitchell and his work on chemiosmosis during her PhD. Career and research Palmer's main research interest is in the processes by which bacteria secrete proteins into their environment. She was one of the co-discoverers of the bacterial Tat protein secretion system. The Tat system is highly unusual because it transports folded proteins of variable sizes across biological membranes while at the same time maintaining the impermeability of the membrane to ions. Palmer has initiated work on a second type of protein transporter‚Äì the Type VII secretion system (T7SS) in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Her group have demonstrated for the first time that the T7SS is involved in interbacterial competition by showing that the S. aureus T7SS secretes a large nuclease toxin, which inhibits the growth of closely related S. aureus strains. Palmer's early career included a post doctoral research position at the University of Dundee (1992-1993) where she was a member of Professor David H. Boxer's group in the Department of Biochemistry. At that time Palmer was studying 'Protein FA' - the factor d'association needed for the final step in molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide biosynthesis. Palmer purified the protein and identified it as the product of the _mobA_ gene. From 1993-1996 Palmer was an independent University Research Fellow at the University of Dundee leading a study in to the anaerobic metabolism of _Rhodobacter sphaeroides_. Indeed, the behaviour of the periplasmic DMSO reductase of _Rh. sphaeroides_ and its _E. coli_ homologue TMAO reductase laid the foundations for Palmer's future research on the Tat pathway. In 1996 Palmer was awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship (URF), which was administered by the University of East Anglia in Norwich while Palmer's new research group was based in the Department of Molecular Microbiology at the John Innes Centre. In 2004 Palmer was awarded an MRC Senior Non-Clinical Research Fellowship and was promoted to a Personal Chair in Molecular Microbiology by the University of East Anglia. While in Norwich Palmer began a long collaboration with Professor Ben C. Berks FRS (now of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Oxford). Together they were awarded the 2002 Microbiology Society Fleming Prize Lecture for characterisation of the bacterial twin-arginine protein targeting (Tat) system. In 2007 Palmer was recruited back to the University of Dundee to take up a new position in the College of Life Sciences. Palmer was Head of the Division of Molecular Microbiology at Dundee from 2009-2017 before leaving to join Newcastle University in 2018. She is now Head of the research theme Microbes in Health & Disease, which is part of the Newcastle Biosciences Institute (Faculty of Medical Sciences). =Awards and honours= Palmer was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018 for ‚Äúsubstantial contributions to the improvement of natural knowledge‚Äù.

This is described most often as a type of media bias in coverage of topics, as a general form of favoritism, or as a criticism raised in data gathering such as statistical studies and polling. In media Television programs, especially news, have been criticized for covering urban centers disproportionately. In the United Kingdom, the BBC was perceived to have a bias towards the London metropolitan area, prompting ITV to launch in the 1950s as a series of independent regional companies. In 2007, BBC's coverage bias toward London was criticized by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond (SNP) as \\"hideously White City\\", and Welsh MP Adam Price (Plaid Cymru) threatened to withhold part of the license fee over \\"minuscule\\" Wales coverage. The BBC corporation's governance body, BBC Trust, produced a 2014 report indicating bias against coverage related to rural England, though noting Wales and Scotland coverage was more balanced. In resource allocation The term 'metropolitan bias' has been used to describe unequal allocation of resources, such as governmental services. In one study, Ferr√© et al (2010) noted that, in the 1970s to 1980s, \\"urban bias\\" was a tendency of governments to disproportionately tax rural activities like agriculture and invest in urban-based industrialization. By 2010, they state, 75% of those living in extreme poverty (defined as less than $1 per day) lived in rural settings. In eight developing countries examined (Albania, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, Thailand, and Sri Lanka), the authors noted a disproportional amount of services for the poor were available in urban areas. They concluded that \\"any strategy for urban poverty reduction that places greater focus on, or allocates more resources to, metropolitan areas, suffers from a 'metropolitan bias' analogous to the urban bias of old.\\" In other areas In 2000, several architects from Scotland and Wales made claims of metropolitan bias in selections for the Stirling Prize after five out of seven designs shortlisted by judges were located within London, despite the scope of the contest at the time extending to all of Europe. Critics also described the list as \\"London-centric\\". The chairman representing the judges in the contest dismissed the claims, noting that the first Stirling Prize was awarded to a building in Manchester.

Early life  V√©rit√© sur les insurrections de l'arm√©e pendant l'√©t√© de 1790, by Thomas-Augustin de Gasparin. Thomas-Augustin Gasparin came from the cadet branch of the noble Corsican Gaspari family, this branch having adopted Protestantism following the marriage of one of its members with a daughter of the agronomist Olivier de Serres. He was serving as a captain in the Picardy regiment in 1789 when the French Revolution broke out, of which he was an enthusiastic supporter. In 1790 Gasparin published a short pamphlet, ‚ÄùV√©rit√© Sur Les Insurrections de L‚ÄôArm√©e Pendant L‚Äô√ât√© de 1790‚Äù (‚ÄùThe Truth About the Insurrections in the Army in the Summer of 1790‚Äù), defending the good name of ordinary French soldiers, and blaming corrupt officers for depriving the men of their dues. Late in 1791 another mutiny broke out, in the Picardy regiment, then stationed at Saarlouis, with soldiers demanding their back pay. Gasparin pledged his personal fortune with Jewish money-lenders to raise the necessary funds and calm the revolt.  National Legislative Assembly  Gasparin was elected from Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne to the National Legislative Assembly on 5 September 1791 with 397 votes out of 552. He arrived in Paris on 3 October, where he joined the Jacobin Club. On 14 October he was appointed to the Committee for Military Law and Regulations. He also opposed Brissot and the Girondins on the topic of war with Austria. At the Jacobin Club and in the National Assembly he denounced what he called their campaign of panic and lies.‚Äù On 10 August he was made Commissar of the Army of the Midi with Lacombe-Saint Michel and Rouyer.  The Convention  Gasparin stood for election from the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne for the new Convention and was elected with 716 votes out of 728. On 26 September 1792, his continuing position on the War Committee was confirmed, and soon afterwards he left for the Dauphin√© with his colleagues to visit the encampment of de Montesquiou-F√©zensac. The general was subsequently accused, on 9 November, of having negotiated a compromise with the Republic of Geneva instead of occupying the city. Gasparin, Dubois-Cranc√© and Lacombe Saint-Etienne were ordered by the Convention to dismiss him. On 3 January 1793, he made a speech in the Convention denouncing the leading Girondins, Guadet, Gensonn√© and Vergniaud for treason by dealing secretly with the king in July 1792, using the painter Joseph Boze as an intermediary. During the same session, the monarchist Lanjuinais demanded that Gasparin himself be arrested for treason, but nothing came of his initiative. During the roll-call vote on the sentencing of Louis XVI on 14 January 1793, he voted for death, against a referendum on the sentence, and against reprieve. Between January and March he worked with his colleagues on the War Committee on the means of building a more professional army to defend the Republic. On 4 April 1793 he was sent to the Armies of the North and of the Ardennes. He was there when Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez went over to the Austrians with the young duc de Chartres, son of Louis Philippe d'Orl√©ans, and took all necessary measures to respond to the gravity of the defection. On 15 May, he was named adjutant general by the Provisional Executive Council. His fellow-deput√© for Bouches- du-Rh√¥ne, the Girondin Barbaroux, attacked him for this appointment. In response Gasparin wrote from Lille to both the Committee of Public Safety and the Convention, summarising his loyal work as repr√©sentant en mission and his military achievements.  Committee of Public Safety  Together with Jeanbon Saint Andr√© he joined the Committee of Public Safety on 13 June 1793, replacing Robert Lindet and Jean-Baptiste Treilhard. On 16 June, before leaving for the Vend√©e, he proposed a decree imposing the death penalty for French citizens and foreigners alike found guilty of spying in war zones or in the armies, which was adopted by the Convention. In the Vend√©e, he drew up a report on the military situation and returned to Paris. During the voting on 10 July to determine who should next serve on the Committee, Gasparin was retained - the sole career soldier on it at that time - even though under Danton's leadership, its conduct of the war was heavily criticised. Gasparin had mixed views about the case of general Custine, supporting him because of the need for proper organisation in the army and the lack of superior officers; but nevertheless not disagreeing with the Committee's arrest of Custine on 2 July. The following day however he resigned, mentioning that he had very serious health problems - earlier in the year he had been obliged to give up his mission to the Army of the North because of a severe case of swollen glands and pain in his sides. Maximilien Robespierre replaced him on the committee. Gasparin was next sent first to the army of the Alps and then to Marseille, from where he went on to Toulon. His exemplary conduct during the siege of Toulon played an important part in recovering the town from the British.  Death  At Aix-en-Provence, he met the young officer Napoleon Bonaparte, introduced to him by Augustin Robespierre and Christophe Saliceti. Napoleon read aloud to them from his pamphlet ‚ÄùLe souper de Beaucaire‚Äù and the representatives of the Convention decided to have it printed at Valence at public expense. In a letter to the Committee of Public Safety, Gasparin and Saliceti recommended Bonaparte to replace the artillery commander Elz√©ar Auguste Cousin de Dommartin, who had been wounded in combat at the Ollioules gorges. Their recommendation was accepted. Fighting at Toulon was fierce and Gasparin took part in the assaults, being one of the first to enter the great bastion. The Committee of Public Safety recognised his efforts and, in the light of his continuing ill health, sent Barras and Fr√©ron to support him and Saliceti. On 15 Brumaire Year II (5 November 1793), he sent a letter to the Convention conveying his confident expectation of the fall of Toulon. This was to be his last letter and he did not live to see the city retaken. He caught pneumonia and was taken to his family in Orange. He died on 17 Brumaire Year II (7 November 1793). On Saint Helena, Napoleon later bequeathed a sum of one hundred thousand francs to Gasparin's heirs, because he had, Napoleon said in his will, ‚Äúthrough his protection, sheltered me from the persecutions of the ignorance of staff officers who commanded the army of Toulon before Dugommier arrived.‚Äù He was buried in the Protestant cemetery in the rue Saint-Cl√©ment in Orange. An initiative to place his heart in the Panth√©on, adopted by the Convention, was never carried out.  Family  Gasparin married Marie-Anne Marguerite de Serres. Both his son Adrien de Gasparin and his grandson Ag√©nor de Gasparin were important public figures in French political life.

The turning point comes when he finally decides to publish a book inspired by the moving experience of his father-in-law's death. At first his book will not get great fame but later Rob will find himself having to travel around the world submerged by important conferences and meetings with curious readers and authors. This unfortunately will lead him to put his loved ones in the background and to separate from his wife. To bring him back down to earth will be an elderly gentleman who will point out to him what he is losing, foreseeing his near death. Therefore, he will no longer be able to reconcile with his family if he does not put his interests aside. This man looks like an angel sent by God to get Rob back on the right path.
