Born in Bratislava, Slovakia to economist and secretary parents who love music and were supportive of her talents, Orgonasova studied voice and piano at the Music Conservatory and Music Academy. She sang as a soloist at the State Opera in Bansk√° Bystrica before moving to Germany in 1983 to become a member of the Hagen Opera House, where she remained until 1988. The outstanding quality of her voice was quickly recognised and she was soon engaged in operas and concerts all over Europe. She made her debut at the Vienna Volksoper in 1988, singing Donna Anna and in 1992 at the Vienna State Opera singing Konstanze and Pamina, roles she repeated at the festivals of Aix-en-Provence and Salzburg. She sang Konstanze for her debut at the Op√©ra de Paris, a role she also recorded to great acclaim with John Eliot Gardiner. Her debut role at the Royal Opera House in London, was Aspasia. Other notable Mozart roles include Giunia, Fiordiligi, Ilia. She also won considerable acclaim in George Frideric Handel's operas such as Alcina and Rinaldo. Her wide repertory also embraced Marzelline, Agathe, Amina, Lucia, Luisa, Gilda, Violetta, Mimi, Li√π, Marguerite, Micaela, Antonia, etc., in all of which one can appreciate the pearly sheen of her voice and the brilliance of her coloratura technique. Orgon√°≈°ov√° can be heard in several important recordings, notably an early recital \\"Favorite Soprano Arias\\", a complete La boh√®me and a sensational La Sonnambula recorded live at the Concertgebouw under Alberto Zedda, all with Naxos Records. She also recorded Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz with the Berlin Philharmonic under Nikolaus Harnoncourt and superb versions for Archiv of Mozart's The Abduction from the Seraglio and Don Giovanni. Her version of Verdi's Requiem with Sir John Eliot Gardiner was the first with period instruments. She has also made important recordings of Britten's War Requiem with Gardiner, Beethoven's Missa Solemnis with both Colin Davis and David Zinman and Schubert masses with Harnoncourt. She recorded the role of Armida in Handel's Rinaldo with Christopher Hogwood and Cecilia Bartoli. Early in her career she recorded Pamina for ERATO under Armin Jordan. Her recording of Rossini's Stabat Mater with the Vienna Philharmonic and Myung-Whun Chung is considered the finest ever. She enjoys reading and walking in the calm woods surrounding her home near Zurich, Switzerland. In the past few years she has focused mostly on recitals rather than operatic performances. She sang the aria, \\"Chi il bel sogno di Doretta?\\", from La rondine, an opera by Giacomo Puccini, over the closing credits of in \\"Irregular Around the Margins,\\" the fifty-seventh episode of the HBO original series The Sopranos.\\" Sources * Grove Music Online, John Allison, Oxford University Press, 2008. * Favorite Soprano Arias, Keith Anderson, Naxos Records, 1991. * ƒΩubica Orgon√°≈°ov√°: Plaka≈• nie je m√¥j ≈°t√Ωl, Alena Horv√°thov√°- ƒåis√°rikov√°, Slovenka 04.11.2010.

Blues writer Mary Katherine Aldin describes it as an uptempo twelve-bar blues, with \\"a spare, lilting musical framework\\", and a strong vocal. The song's rhythmic approach has also been compared to that of Jimmy Reed. Tucker's lyrics recall the time he spent as a Golden Gloves boxer in the 1950s: Background and recording The song came out of Tucker's association with producer Herb Abramson, who was a co- founder of Atlantic Records. Abramson operated A-1 Sound Studios in New York, where many popular R&B; artists recorded; he leased Tucker's recording to Checker Records, which released it as a single in 1964. Although writers cite a 1963 recording date, there is conflicting information about the studio location. Aldrin puts it in Chicago, while the Blues Foundation locates it in New York City. The song's distinctive guitar parts are provided by Dean Young. Writing in Encyclopedia of the Blues, Gene Tomko notes the similarity to the introduction and shuffle beat of the popular Jimmy Reed song \\"Big Boss Man\\". Charts and legacy Tommy Tucker's original recording reached number one on the Cash Box R&B; Locations chart and number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100.

L.No. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224 (2001) was assessed for legal consequences and it was determined that the President \\"may deploy military force domestically and to prevent and deter similar terrorist attacks.\\" Third, the Posse Comitatus Act was reviewed and it was determined that the act only applies to \\"domestic use of the Armed Forces for law enforcement purposed rather that for the performance of military functions.\\" Fourth, it was determined that military intrusion into terrorist cells does not violate the Fourth Amendment. Fifth and finally the government has \\"a compelling interest in protecting the nation\\" and \\"the war effort would outweigh the relevant privacy interests\\" in regards to a claim of unreasonable search and seizure. The terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001 are unprecedented and thus the President's authority to deploy military force against terrorist threats is affirmed. The scale of these terrorist attacks has been viewed as a campaign against the United States and thus viewed as an act of war. History of federal forces in law enforcement 1st Marine Division were used to control crowds in 1992 Los Angeles riots. Over the course of the last two hundred and fifteen years the Army and Marine Corps have been used to intervene in domestic affairs and enforce laws. Federal troops have been used to control riots, protect minorities from violence, break strikes and guard the borders. Due to partiality and unreliability of state militias, Presidents have found that the use of federal troops was a much more effective means of controlling such domestic disturbances. The use of federal troops in recent times has lessened due to Presidents' preference to let state governors utilize state militias to handle issues within the states. Over the last two centuries laws regarding the use of Federal troops to regulate domestic matters have been augmented to reflect lessons learned from previous use of federal troops in civil matters. These laws are based on past experience and were not developed to handle new and unprecedented events such as domestic terrorist attacks. ; List of US Military interventions on United States soil: The Necessity for Authorized Use of Military Forces within the United States As unprecedented events occur in history it is necessary to examine current policies for adequacy. A federal law that \\"prohibits military personnel from enforcing the law within the United States\\" is an inadequate policy for addressing the Global War on Terrorism. In years prior to September 11, 2001 the Department of Defense narrowly focused on the military's ability to enforce laws domestically and not the President's authority to authorize such use of force. The effect on the United States Judicial System Hamdi during his detention at Guantanamo Bay. The document pertaining to the Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States has been mentioned in several Supreme Court cases. Two cases that stand out are the Hamdi v. Rumsfeldhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6173897153146757813&q;=Authority+for+Use+of+Military+Force+to+Combat+Terrorist+Activities+Within+the+United+States&hl;=en&as;_sdt=20000006 case and the Hamdan v. Rumsfeld case. These two cases are examples of challenges to the constitutionality of the Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States. Controversy over the Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States Other than the implications of this document in the Supreme Court this document has received criticisms elsewhere. A memo that originated from the U.S. Justice Department stated that the memo concerning the Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States \\"should not be treated as authoritative for any purpose.\\" This memo continues to highlight that the original memo was written in the time immediately after the September 11 attacks and therefore it is no longer relevant. The original memo stated that the use of military force domestically was not a violation of the fourth amendment, however in the more recent memo it is stated that this is no longer the view of the administration. The more recent memo also recants the statement that the first amendment could be suspended. It also continues to sort out any discrepancies.

A National Historic Landmark, the site is significant as an important Central Plains habitation site, with an unusually well-preserved burial complex. The site is on private land, and is not open to the public. Site description The site is located on private property in rural Saline County, Kansas, between the cities of Salina and New Cambria, southeast of the corner of U.S. Route 40 and Simpson Rd, and north of Smoky Hill River. It occupies a portion of alluvial flood plain between the Smoky Hill and Saline Rivers, whose confluence lies to the east. It is unknown exactly what courses the rivers would have followed at the time of the site's occupation. The site's features are interpreted as being of a small village, with twelve to fifteen low mounds (no longer extant due to agricultural use of the property) identified as house sites in the 1930s. These sites, and others that may have predated that survey, are now identifiable only by shallow deposits of cultural materials. Dating of finds at the site yields an occupation time of about 1000 to 1350 CE. History By accident in 1873, Benjamin Marlin encountered bones when he was constructing a dugout home on his land. In 1936, Guy and Mabel Whiteford started excavating the site. For many decades, it was a tourist trap known as the Indian Burial Pit or Salina Burial Pit. It was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1964. and In 1989, the state of Kansas purchased the site. In 1990, the pit was filled with sand and covered with a concrete cap to protect it, then covered with dirt and grass. Marker A former Kansas Historical Marker sign along U.S. Route 40 describes it as follows (complete text): > Several hundred years ago, perhaps more than a thousand, this valley was > inhabited by men whose average height was probably well over six feet. These > were not the indians of quivira, whose \\"7-foot warriors\\" coronado described > in 1541, but an even earlier people. Here they lived in earth lodges, > tilling the soil, hunting and fishing, and here they left records of unusual > archaeological importance. One mile southeast of this marker is a burial pit > containing more than 140 skeletal remains that demonstrate the remarkable > size and strength of these prehistoric indians. The pit was discovered in > 1936. It has been scientifically excavated, with the skeletons still > preserved in the same flexed positions of their burial centuries ago. Among > the objects found in the pit are pieces of pottery, a grinding stone, > parched corn and beans. A stone tomahawk, ceremonial flint knives, and clam- > shell beads and ear pendants.

The pub is chiefly notable for having been featured in Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus series of novels. The Oxford Bar, or The Ox, is John Rebus's favourite pub in Edinburgh. History The Oxford Bar apparently became a public house in 1811, although it was a confectioner's shop in 1843. It was disponed on 30 October 1893 to Andrew Wilson, wines and spirits merchant, and thereafter remained a public bar. The Oxford Bar retains its original compartmentalised form, which many other local bars have lost. Originally consisting of a central corridor with rooms to right and left, the corridor has been opened up to the left with an archway into the small stand- up bar but the original form is still clear. It is a Category B listed building. Patrons Several Scottish writers and artists are also said to have been patrons of the Oxford Bar, including Sydney Goodsir Smith and Willie Ross. In fact, the pub was first immortalised in Smith's Carotid Cornucopius. Ian Rankin is also a patron of the Oxford Bar, and chose it as Rebus's pub because a lot of police officers drink there. In Dirty Work: Ian Rankin and John Rebus Book-By-Book, Ray Dexter and Nadine Carr note that the Oxford Bar would be an improbable local for Rebus due to its geographical location. Other visitors to the bar have included actor Sean Connery and author Colin Dexter. Quintin Jardine's 2009 Bob Skinner novel, Fatal Last Words, also mentions the Oxford Bar considerably, again due to the connection with the local police force drinking there. There are a few other nods to Rankin too.

It came after the first two Raccoons seasonal specials, which were The Christmas Raccoons (1980) and The Raccoons on Ice (1981). There are some thematic elements that did not exist in the first two specials, such as the Raccoons' world being separate from that of the humans. In the United States, where The Raccoons specials were in the top 10 in Nielsen ratings, The Raccoons and the Lost Star was the number one children's two-part special in syndication at the time. Plot One night in the Evergreen Forest, Schaeffer the sheepdog is playing with his human owners, Tommy and Julie, when their father, Ranger Dan has a surprise for them. As Schaeffer takes a brief nap, he is awoken by a glowing red plane that lands in front of the cabin. Schaeffer goes to investigate, but the pilot gets a call from his commanding officer to return to his base. Panicking, Schaeffer climbs into the passenger seat of the plane and is flown away from Earth and to a strange jungle planet. Upon his arrival to a giant base filled with weaponry, he's chased by the forces of the Imperial Commander Cyril Sneer, but escapes them. Schaeffer runs into Sophia Tutu, a friend of his from the planet Earth, although Sophia doesn't seem to know Schaeffer. Sophia takes Schaeffer to meet Broo, her pet sheepdog puppy. Meanwhile, Cyril Sneer plans to conquer Earth with the help of a magic star (which Broo wears around his neck). The star has enough power to launch his firepower to raid the planet. He sends out his army to hunt down every animal in the jungle and find the star. Meanwhile, Sophia, Broo, and Schaeffer are captured by the Raccoons (Ralph, Bert and Melissa). The trio are the only animals left in the jungle. They free Sophia, Broo and Schaeffer finding they are on their side. Sophia then meets up with her boyfriend Cedric Sneer and finds out that Cyril is Cedric's father. After a series of animals being rescued and recaptured, Cyril notices on a security tape that Broo has the star. That night, Cyril discovers a \\"jungle rendezvous\\" Cedric is having with Sophia and he follows him and has Sophia imprisoned and soon all her friends, but with Broo and Cedric's help, the Raccoons and the other animals escape from Cyril's clutches and destroy his fortress in the process. After rejoice, Bert flies Schaeffer back to Earth via airplane. Schaeffer awakes from his long dream and sees that Ranger Dan, Tommy and Julie reveal their surprise to him, which turns out to be Broo.

The special was originally meant to be a full- length feature, but was made into an hour-long special, due to a lack of funding. Reception Variety praised the third special, The Raccoons and the Lost Star, calling it a rollicking good adventure filled with space-age animation, high-tech gadgetry, lilting tunes, a lovable sheepdog, and the delightful Raccoons team.

Lying in Cedar Creek Canyon near the Carbon County line, Mohrland was Emery County's largest coal mining town, with a history more typical of Carbon County's coal camps than of most Emery County communities. History Coal mining in Cedar Creek Canyon began on a small scale sometime before 1896, producing coal mainly for local home heating use. In 1907 an investment group bought the mine and surrounding land. They incorporated as the Castle Valley Fuel Company and surveyed a townsite called Mohrland. The name was formed as an acronym from the initials of the surnames of the company's principal investors: Mays, Orem, Heiner, and Rice. Coal started shipping by April 1910, and despite Castle Valley Fuel's financial problems, the town continued growing. A business district was soon established in Mohrland, including a hospital, company boarding house, Errol Charlestrom's Wasatch Store, a post office, and several saloons. In 1915 ownership of the mine was transferred to the United States Fuel Company, which also ran the town of Hiawatha just to the north. By 1920 Mohrland had over 200 houses, a large amusement hall, and a school. The population was about 1000. Mohrland was a company town throughout its history; the mine owners essentially ran the town. The company worked to make it a pleasant place to live, despite its location at the edge of the desert. The streets were lined with shade trees, and a small stream ran along the canyon bottom. Mine employees' benefits included medical services, as well as regularly scheduled dances, films, and other social events. Mohrland's company baseball team was particularly popular and successful. In the spring of 1915, as champions of the Carbon County league, they played an exhibition game at Price against the Chicago White Sox, drawing an audience of over 10,000, but losing by a score of 17 to 1. The most successful years were the early 1920s, but by 1925 coal prices and profits were down. On March 1, 1925, U.S. Fuel closed down the mine without warning, leaving Mohrland's residents without jobs and without credit at the company store. Many people had no money or food. The company reopened Mohrland just as suddenly in September 1926, and the town struggled back to its feet. In 1930 the population was 620. Coal production continued to become less profitable during the Great Depression. In 1938 U.S. Fuel announced a decision to close Mohrland and consolidate mining operations at Hiawatha, which had a slightly shorter shipping route and more room to build a new preparation plant. The buildings were sold to a salvage company for $50 each, and very little of the town was left behind.

Early life He was born in Aldersgate, London, where his father maintained a home and a newly established printing press. He studied at Eton College and enrolled at King's College, Cambridge in 1572, where he was named a fellow in 1574.Miller. He graduated with a bachelor's degree a year later, and intended to continue his studies to earn a master's degree.Evenden, \\"Day, Richard\\". However, he instead returned home without matriculating. Day would later assert that family pressures forced him to leave Cambridge; he claimed that his stepmother (his father's second wife, Alice Lehunte) had been complaining about the high cost of his education, and that his father needed him to be his \\"corrector of his print\\" for his publishing business.Evenden, \\"A Biography of John Day\\". It seems, though, that his real reason for returning home may have been that he had fallen in love with a young woman who lived near his father's printing press. Work as printer Day's return to Aldersgate coincided with the third printing run of his father's highly successful publication of John Foxe's Actes and Monuments. His father decided to put Day in charge of the printing of this edition, despite his son's youth and inexperience. The result was a disaster, and the third edition was criticized for its poor quality. As a result, Day's father imposed strict constraints on him to maintain close scrutiny of his work, which led to a strain in their relations. Day hoped to obtain greater freedom from his father and independence as a printer. He was allowed into the Stationers' Company, of which his father was also a member, and in 1578, he printed his first publication: his own translation of Foxe's Christ Jesus Triumphant. He also started pirating his father's works, issuing illicit editions of The ABC with Little Catechism and The Whole Booke of Psalmes, Collected into English Meter. His father, who had by now become a Master of the Stationers' Company, was enraged. In 1580, with the help of the Company's wardens, he entered his son's premises and seized his printing equipment and stock by force. The public act may have been an attempt by John Day to send a message that he would pursue issues of piracy, no matter who the perpetrator. Work as clergy Jobless, Richard Day turned to the Church of England. His father had intended on him entering the clergy since childhood, and Day's turn to religion may have been an attempt to repair relations. He was ordained on 1 December 1580 and began serving as a vicar in Mundon, Essex. This did little to appease his father though, who wrote his deed to deprive Day of his inheritance. After his father's death in 1584, he successfully challenged the deed in court. Later years Little is known about Day's activities in his later years. He resigned from the Church in 1584, and watched over the patents that he inherited from his father, although he never printed any works himself. When Thomas Morley published Richard Allison's Psalmes of David in Metre in 1599, he sued, claiming this infringed on the Day patent for printing the metrical psalter. It is unknown whether any settlement was reached. On 13 April 1606, the Stationers' Company granted 7 shillings to \\"Richard dayes wydowe for her relief\\". The Day patents were passed to the Stationers' Company in 1614.

While serving as the athletic director at Geneva College, he organized the first college basketball team in 1892. He graduated from the Western Theological Seminary and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1897. From 1899 to 1901, he served as the first basketball and second football coach at Michigan Agricultural College (now known as Michigan State University). After retiring from coaching, Bemies served for many years as a Presbyterian minister and evangelist in rural Pennsylvania. He was also active with YMCA, serving with that organization in Russia in 1918 and in South Dakota in the early 1920s.

Early YMCA work and Springfield College Bemies became involved in the work of YMCA early in his life. He worked for YMCA in Burlington, Iowa for two years. In the late 1880s, he attended the International YMCA Training School (now known as Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. While studying at Springfield, Bemies became acquainted with James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, who was a physical education teacher at the school. Some accounts state that Bemies was a prot√©g√© of Naismith while at Springfield. One biographical account indicates that Bemies was also a teacher at YMCA College in Springfield for one year. Geneva College In 1889, Bemies accepted a position as the athletic director and head of the Department of Physical Culture at Geneva College, a Christian liberal arts college in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, north of Pittsburgh. He held that position from 1889 to 1894. In 1889, he organized the school's Athletic Association.Glasgow, The Geneva Book, p. 158. He also organized a YMCA program at Geneva. As one book notes, \\"In the fall of 1890, Prof. Bemies organized a 'Young Men's Christian Association,' which continues as an educative factor in the religious life of students.\\"Glasgow, The Geneva Book, p. 122. Bemies organized the football program at Geneva College in 1890 and served as the coach, captain and a player at the halfback and center positions from 1890 to 1893.Glasgow, The Geneva Book, pp. 163-164. The Geneva College football team played only one game in 1890, losing to the University of Pittsburgh by a score of 10 to 4. In 1891, Bemies led the team to an expanded six-game schedule in which the \\"Covies\\" (as the team was known at the time) compiled a 4-2 record and outscored opponents by a cumulative total of 126 to 78.Geneva Football Media Guide, p. 2. In 1892, Bemies led the team to a 3-3 record. He led the team again in 1893 to a record of 3-2. During his four years with the program, the Geneva College football team compiled an overall record of 10-8. Bemies is best known for his role as a pioneer of college basketball. In 1892, after witnessing an exhibition basketball game arranged by Naismith in Springfield, Bemies formed the first college basketball team at Geneva College. Under Bemies' guidance, Geneva College became the first college in the United States to field a basketball team. Interviewed in 2010, Ian Naismith, a basketball historian and the grandson of the sport's inventor, sought to settle disputing claims as to which college was the first to introduce basketball. Naismith said, \\"My grandfather considered Geneva to be the birthplace of college basketball, and how can anybody argue with him? If you say anything differently, you're calling my grandfather, my father, and me, liars.\\" Records are inconsistent as to the date of the first Geneva College basketball game. One account indicates that Bemies staged basketball games at Geneva \\"in the early months of 1892.\\" Another account suggests that a report on gymnasium football in the February 1892 edition of the college newspaper, the Geneva Cabinet, may refer to the newly developed game of basketball. The newspaper account from February 1892 reported: \\"Football in the gym is a popular mode of exercise at present. Some severe knocks are received, but in the excitement, they are hardly noticed.\\" In December 1892, the same newspaper reported: \\"Basketball is quite a go in the gym now. It suits very well to take the place of football for those who love a rough and tumble game.\\" Several sources are in agreement that, in April 1893, Geneva's basketball team played a game against a YMCA team from nearby Brighton, Pennsylvania. According to the college's current web site, \\"Geneva first played in collegiate competition on April 8, 1893 using peach baskets as goals, defeating the New Brighton YMCA 3 - 0.\\" However, a history of the college published in 1908 notes that, \\"Basket Ball was not introduced by a regularly organized team until the fall of 1897.\\"Glasgow, The Geneva Book, p. 170. In a 1972 article, J. Vale Downie wrote that \\"interest in the game lapsed with the departure of Professor Bemies,\\" and it was not until 1897 the sport was revived at Geneva. Bemies was trained as gymnast and also instructed Geneva College students in fencing, boxing and wrestling.Geneva's Basketball First He also played at first base for Geneva's baseball team in 1892.Glasgow, The Geneva Book, p. 159. In an 1892 report, Geneva's Board of Trustees wrote of Bemies: > \\"Strong inducements to leave us have been held out to Prof. O.C. [sic] > Bemies of the department of physical culture. The Board could ill afford to > keep him; and still less could it afford to lose him. He is a master in the > work of physical culture, and has far greater worth, to us, for the culture > of the soul. Prof. Bemies is a thoroughly conscientious and consistent > Christian, outspoken in his opposition to dancing, card playing, theater > going, tobacco using, and all such degrading and demoralizing habits, which > are so ensnaring to students. Arrangements have been made by which he will > be with us next year.\\" Western Theological Seminary After leaving Geneva College, Bemies enrolled at the Western Theological Seminary in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1897 and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister that same year. Bemies also studied at The Graduate Divinity School at the University of Chicago. Michigan Agricultural College Bemies served as the second head football coach (and first professional football coach) at Michigan Agricultural College, now known as Michigan State University, from 1899 to 1900, compiling a record of 3‚Äì10‚Äì1. According to one account, \\"When Michigan State began playing football in 1896, the game was considered such a rowdy affair that the college fathers demanded that a minister handle the team to keep it within decent bounds. Thus the Rev. Charles O. Bemies became the school's first coach.\\" Bemies was also the first head basketball coach at Michigan Agricultural from 1899 to 1901, tallying a mark of 5‚Äì2, and the head coach of Michigan Agricultural's baseball team from 1900 to 1901, where his record was 4‚Äì10. According to one history of Michigan State University, Bemies was asked to resign after the poor showing of the football team in 1900: \\"The football team's poor performance in 1900, which ended with a 23-0 defeat by Alma, led the athletic association to ask for Bemies's resignation. Although the players saw Bemies as a 'good man,' they refused to play for him after the season ended.\\" Pastor and evangelist After retiring from coaching, Bemies worked for two years as a country pastor in western Pennsylvania. He next served for 16 years as the pastor of the Presbyterian church in McClellandtown, Pennsylvania, a rural community located about 75 miles south of Pittsburgh. He remained at McClellandtown until the outbreak of World War I, when he left to serve as a chaplain. He also became prominent in Prohibition politics and briefly entered the newspaper business.(\\"Rev. C. O. Bemies today announced his intention to quit the pulpit to take up the pen. He will enter the newspaper field January 1 as assistant to editor W. M. Likins of the People's Tribune. Rev. Bemies has been prominent in Prohibition politics for some time past and was in the limelight for a time when the Presbytery directed him to leave his pulpit at McClellandtown, which he refused to do.\\") One of his efforts as the pastor in McClellandtown was the construction of the \\"Brotherhood Building,\\" a 72' by 42' structure including a gymnasium where the local boys played basketball, a kitchen, and an auditorium. In 1913, Bemies wrote an article on his experiences as a rural pastor that was published in a magazine called \\"Rural Manhood.\\" He also wrote articles promoting issues such as good roads, better schools and scientific agriculture as means to promote the advancement of rural life. In 1909, his presbytery sought to remove Bemies from his position at the church in McClellandtown, but he continued to serve when his congregation refused to accept any other pastor. Bemies later wrote about the circumstances leading to the attempt to remove him as pastor: > \\"Our greatest drawback in the church work was the presence of several > exceedingly active gossips and trouble makers. After four years of patient > endurance the success of the work demanded that the practice stop, so we > were forced to suspend a sister who was addicted to the habit. She > immediately gathered on her side the other trouble makers, including the > church boss and a few relatives and hangers-on, both in and out of the > church. A majority leaders of Presbytery secured enough votes to forcibly > remove me by vote from the official pastorate of the church against the > unanimous vote and the protest of the congregation upholding me.

George Denman - Vanity Fair caricature 1892 Early life Denman was born at 50 Russell Square, London, the fourth son of Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman, of Dovedale, and his wife Theodosia Anne Vevers.the Peerage.com He was educated at Repton School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a pupil of Joseph Blakesley. Denman became a Fellow of Trinity College. A student at Lincoln's Inn from November 1843, he read in the chambers of Peter Bellinger Brodie. In November 1844 he became a pupil of Barnes Peacock, and was called to the Bar in November 1846. Legal career George Denman, 1893 portrait Denman was appointed Cambridge University counsel in 1857. He became a Queen's Counsel (QC) in 1861. In 1872 he was appointed Justice of the Court of Common Pleas and resigned his seat in the House of Commons. In 1875, he was appointed a Judge of the High Court, turning down the customary knighthood because he was the son of a peer. He retired as a judge in 1892 and in 1893 was invested as a Privy Counsellor. It was said of Denman that \\"He looked a model Judge. But he was never quite so good a Judge as he looked.\\"Vanity Fair He Was an Ornament on the Bench (Stuff), 19 November 1892 In politics In 1856, Denman stood for parliament unsuccessfully for Cambridge University. He was elected Member of Parliament for Tiverton at the 1859 general election and held the seat until 1865. In 1866, he was re-elected MP for Tiverton. Denman was known as a criminal law reformer. He gave evidence, however, to the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864‚Äì66, supporting the retention of public executions. In parliament he interested himself in the reform of the law of evidence in criminal trials, and on 20 June 1860 moved the second reading of the Felony and Misdemeanor Bill, which aimed to assimilate proceedings for a criminal trial to those current in civil trials (at nisi prius). The bill passed the Commons, but was abandoned after alteration in the Lords. Five years later, 22 February 1865, he successfully carried through a similar measure, the Felony and Misdemeanor Evidence and Practice Act. The Evidence Further Amendment Act of 1869, popularly known as Denman's Act, was his personal initiative. It meant that witnesses professing no religious belief were able to affirm in courts of justice, and parties previously incompetent were able to give evidence. Death and legacy Denman died at Cranley Gardens, London, S.W., on 21 September 1896, and was buried in the churchyard at Willian, near Hitchin. A brass with an inscription by John Edwin Sandys was placed in the chapel of Repton School to his memory, and a memorial scholarship founded at the school by public subscription. Works Denman translated Gray's Elegy into Greek and dedicated the work in 1871 to Sir Alexander Cockburn, the Lord Chief Justice. He also translated Alexander Pope's Iliad into Latin and in 1873 dedicated it to W. E. Gladstone, the Prime Minister. Oarsman At Cambridge Denman was an energetic rower and in 1840 rowed for Trinity in the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta. In 1841 he rowed for Cambridge in the Boat Race. Four days before the event he was injured in a collision on the river in a training outing with his brother. He was leeched by the junior footman and recovered sufficiently that Cambridge won the race.G. Denman, quoted in G.C. Drinkwater & T.R.B. Sanders, The University Boat Race: Official Centenary History, pp. 19‚Äì21 He was also bow in the Cambridge Subscription Rooms crew that won the Grand Challenge Cup that year.R C Lehmann The Complete Oarsman In 1842, he won the Colquhoun Sculls, stroked his college boat to the head of the Cam, and rowed for Cambridge again in the Boat Race and in the Grand at Henley. In 1843 he rowed for Trinity again in the Grand in a crew down to seven oarsmen because the stroke went ill and substitutions were not permitted. Trinity lost to a full Oxford University eight that won by two lengths. In 1881 Denman provided an English translation of Herbert Kynaston's Latin hexameters written for the fiftieth anniversary of the Boat Race.

He served as the head football coach at Michigan Agricultural College, now Michigan State University from 1911 to 1915. With a five-year record of 29‚Äì5, he has the highest winning percentage of any football coach in Michigan State history. Macklin coached the Michigan State Spartans football team to its first ever victories over Ohio State, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Penn State. He was also the athletic director at Michigan Agricultural and coached the school's basketball, baseball, and track and field teams. Macklin tallied marks of 48‚Äì38 as head basketball coach (1910‚Äì1916) and 52‚Äì27 as head baseball coach (1911‚Äì1915). Biography =Early years= Macklin was born in Worcester, Massachusetts and attended Worcester High School. He played high school football for four years and was also the captain of Worcester's crew. After graduating from Worcester High School, Macklin attended Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire and then St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, playing football at each school. =Penn= After completing his preparatory education, Macklin enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania. Macklin grew to be a giant of a man for his time. He was 6 feet, 7 inches tall and weighed 275 pounds. When Macklin arrived at Penn, one account indicates there were no uniforms large enough to fit him: \\"When the big husky appeared on the gridiron the first thing the coaches did was to send for the athletic outfitter, for there was not a suit on the campus that would encompass his frame.\\" Macklin played two years at the tackle position for Penn's football team. The Chicago Daily Tribune later wrote: \\"For a big man he was remarkably agile and his tackling on the wings and his quickness in getting through to break up plays was the delight of the coaches.\\" =Coaching career= In 1910, Macklin coached football at a boys' school at Pawling, New York. Macklin's success at Pawling brought him to the attention of Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University), which was in need of a new athletic director and coach. He was hired in January 1911 upon the recommendation of the renowned Penn athletic trainer Mike Murphy. Macklin was the head coach at Michigan State 1911 to 1915 and compiled a record of 29‚Äì5. His winning percentage of .853 is the highest in the history of the Michigan State Spartans football program. Macklin's 1913 Michigan State team finished with an undefeated, untied record of 7‚Äì0 and outscored opponents by a combined score of 180 to 28. Macklin was the first Michigan State coach to lead the Spartans to football victories over Ohio State (35‚Äì20 in 1912), Michigan (12‚Äì7 in 1913), Wisconsin (12‚Äì7 in 1913), and Penn State (6‚Äì3 in 1914). Macklin's 1913 team was also the first racially integrated team in the school's history, as Gideon Smith became the first African-American player for the Spartans. Macklin was also the athletic director and coach of the baseball, men's basketball, and track and field teams. He coached the basketball team from 1910 to 1916 and compiled a 48‚Äì38 (.558) record, including a 12‚Äì3 record for 1911‚Äì12 season. He coached the baseball team from 1911 to 1915, compiling a record of 52‚Äì27 (.658).MSU All-Time Summary Macklin retired from coaching in March 1916 to enter the coal mining business in Pennsylvania. =Later years and honors= The Associated Press in 1949 called Macklin \\"the founding father of the big time at Michigan State College.\\" When he was hired in 1911, the school was putting on games for $200. When he left, the school received guarantees of $10,000 for games. As athletic director, he also led the effort to build new athletic buildings and a modern gymnasium. In 1935, Michigan State renamed its football stadium Macklin Field in his honor. At the time, Macklin was a coal mine operator living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The name was changed to Macklin Stadium in 1948, and in 1957, Macklin's name was dropped and replaced by the current name, Spartan Stadium.College Gridirons, Spartan Stadium. Accessed 2010-04-15.

It was first announced at Breakpoint 2008 in Germany. Linger in Shadows differs in an important aspect from many demoscene products in that it was published by Sony on the PlayStation 3, who trademarked the name late 2007. Many news sites which reported about the demo assumed that it was a tech demo for a future game. This was denied during presentations at E3, although it was revealed that the title does feature interactivity.  Features  A screen capture from Linger in Shadows The interactive parts were first showcased at the Realtime Generation festival in Vienna by lead programmer Michal \\"Bonzaj\\" Staniszewski; it was revealed that the interactive part of the demo is essentially the main storyline, with added interaction using the Sixaxis such as user-controlled camera and the ability to scratch back and forth in the timeline. It also allows the player to play around with some parts of the environment, like rotating certain objects or moving light sources. The demo was later also presented at Nvision 08, in a somewhat updated state. The interactive part initially only lets the user to explore the first fifth of the demo, and the user has to perform various actions with the Sixaxis to unlock the next part, such as shaking the controller or holding it in a certain angle. The scenes also feature hidden greetings to a number of known demogroups, which can be found in more obscure areas of the demo. Unlocking parts of the demo (\\"sigils\\") as well as finding hidden greetings both reward the user with trophies. The demo also features an easter egg, unlockable in the menu by pressing down both analog sticks (L3 and R3) on the Sixaxis. The resulting menu item allows the viewer to watch an \\"oldskool demo\\" with a starfield, two DYCP scrollers (using the Amiga character set) and various other early demo effects such as blitter objects and metaballs (intentionally made to look low resolution), with chiptune music accompanying it. Reception Critical reactions to the project were polarized between two opinions: while some commended the unusual presentation and how the idea of interactive realtime art available on PSN is very much \\"outside the box\\", others claimed that the price was too expensive for a seven-minute experience, and that the controls were fiddly and not integral to the experience. Game Chronicles called the visuals \\"stunning\\" and stated that it's \\"easily the best $3 you can spend in the PlayStation Store\\", giving it 96%. Gamestyle on the other hand, while commending that the demo is \\"breaking new ground\\", called it \\"overpriced\\", while Digital Chumps found \\"the controls frustrating and the entire experience extremely short and jarring\\".

(Ed.). (2012). Journalism in Ancient China. A history of journalism in china (pp.24-70). Honolulu, HI: Enrich Professional Publishing (S) Private Limited. ‚ÄòDibao‚Äô is a general term to describe the ancient Chinese gazette. Historically, there were different types of names used to describe Dibao in different dynasties among the imperial Chinese history. Zhao, Y., Sun, P. (Ed.). (2018). The communication mechanism in ancient China. A History of Journalism and Communication in China (pp.4-22). London, United Kingdom: Routledge. While closest in form and function to gazettes in the Western world, they have also been called \\"palace reports\\" or \\"imperial bulletins\\". Different sources place Dibao's first publication as early as the Han Dynasty (206 BC‚Äì220 AD), which would make Dibao amongst the earliest newspapers in the world, or as late as the Tang Dynasty (June 18, 618‚ÄìJune 4, 907) according to the earliest verified and proved Dibao with historical relics. Dibao was continuously published among different imperial dynasties until the last imperial emperor in the Qing Dynasty, Puyi, abdicated in 1912. Dibao contained official political edicts, announcements, and news from the Chinese imperial central government or local governments,Irving Fang, A History of Mass Communication: Six Information Revolutions, Focal Press, 1997, p. 30 which would be delivered to inform both the central and local governments by messengers periodically and were intended to be seen only by bureaucrats (and a given dibao might only be intended for a certain subset of bureaucrats). Selected items from a gazette might then be conveyed to local citizenry by word of mouth and/or posted announcements. Frequency of publication varied widely over time and place. Before the invention of moveable type printing they were hand-written or printed with engraved wooden blocks. The introduction of European-style Chinese language newspapers, along with the growing intersection of Chinese and global affairs generally, applied pressure for the Dibao to adapt, and circulation of the Beijing Gazette was in the tens of thousands by the time publication ceased altogether with the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911. The gazettes from Beijing at this time were known as Jingbao (‰∫¨Â†±), literally \\"reports from the capital\\".Lamont, Ian, \\"The Rise of the Press in Late Imperial China\\", November 27, 2007  Historical Origin and the Controversy  There are two main origin theories of Dibao: the Han Dynasty origin theory and the Tang Dynasty origin theory. alt= =Han Dynasty Origin theory = At the beginning of the Han Dynasty, the Jun-Xian system (ÈÉ°Á∏£Âà∂) from the Qin Dynasty was implemented to govern the country. The Jun-Xian system is a county system that divided the country into 100 Juns and 1400 Xians, which were the subnational governments that owned the right of autonomy to govern the local issues.Cioffi-Revilla, C., & Lai, D. (1995). War and Politics in Ancient China, 2700 B.C. to 722 B.C.: Measurement and Comparative Analysis. The Journal of Conflict Resolution, 39(3), 467‚Äì494. doi: org/10.1177/0022002795039003004 Under the Jun-Xian system, the county governments were required to report the local affairs to the central government and receive the edicts and political decisions from the central government, which took much time to deliver and receive the information. Di (ÈÇ∏), which literally means the ‚Äòsubnational government officers‚Äô residence in the capital‚Äô, was instituted to solve the intelligence transmission issues and made it more efficient for the Jun-Xian system. Although Di was instituted in the capital, it was not an official administrative department in the ancient Chinese political system because Di was founded by county governments without the official permission from the central government. Di had two functions: to transmit the information, and provide food and accommodation for messengers. Messengers who came and stayed in Di would collect information from the central government, which was called ‚ÄòBao‚Äô(Â†±), and wrote it on the bamboo slips during the Western Han period, and afterwards on paper in the Eastern Han period. The information written on paper and transmitted from Di to the counties was called ‚ÄòDibao‚Äô. = Tang Dynasty Origin theory and Origin controversy = Historians who support the Han Dynasty origin theory argue that the historical information about Dibao in the Han Dynasty had been recorded in several imperial historical texts among many dynasties. Xihan Huiya (Ë•øÊº¢ÊúÉË¶Å), literally ‚ÄòInstitutional history of the Western Han Dynasty', written by Xu Tianlin in the Song Dynasty, records the Dibao delivery situation in the Han Dynasty based on the detailed information about the Jun-Xian system, which is used as reliable evidence to prove the existence of Dibao in the Han Dynasty.alt=Historians who disagree with the Han Dynasty Origin theory argue that Xihan Huiya, which is the only historical text that records Dibao in the Han Dynasty, is used as indirect historical text evidence rather than direct historical relics evidence to prove the existence of Dibao in the Han Dynasty. The earliest verified Dibao with historical text and relics was a Dibao called Kaiyuan Za Bao (ÈñãÂÖÉÈõúÂ†±), which was published in the Kaiyuan period in the Tang Dynasty during the 9th Century. In Chinese imperial historical, there were many recordings written in historical texts that were not completely correct and provable as they could be falsified by historians throughout different imperial dynasties with different political and historical purposes. Historians also doubt the societal and economic conditions in the Han Dynasty that if it was powerful enough to support the huge Dibao delivery system among 100 Juns and 1400 Xians because the continuous wars with the northern Xiongnu (ÂåàÂ•¥) nomadic nation continuously weakened the national strength of the Han Dynasty.Gunaratne, S. A. (2001). Paper, Printing and the Printing Press: A Horizontally Integrative Macro- history Analysis. Gazette (Leiden, Netherlands), 63(6), 459‚Äì479. Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.1177/0016549201063006001  Content  There was little alteration in the content of Dibao in imperial Chinese history since it was first published in the Han Dynasty. There were four main aspects of the Dibao content: = The daily life of the emperor = Under the influence of traditional Chinese ideology based on Confucianism, it was significant for both the publisher and reader to know the speech and behaviour of the emperor because the emperor in ancient China was regarded as the pivot of the whole empire, who played the most important role to govern the country. Quigley, H. (1923). The Political System of Imperial China. The American Political Science Review, 17(4), 551-566. doi:10.2307/1943756 The speeches and behaviours of the emperor would be recorded by the imperial historians surrounding him, which was not only a way for the emperor to ensure the legitimacy of governance and unite the country, but also a way to for the citizen to supervise the speeches and behaviours of the emperor. Mokros, E. (2016). Communication, Empire, and Authority in the Qing Gazette. Retrieved from http://jhir.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/40303 Everything related to the emperor‚Äôs daily life, such as the important speeches, summons, hunts, religious duties, conferment and award ceremonies would be written by the imperial historians on books and published on Dibao. = The significant edict, political decision, and decree = In the Song Dynasty, legislation became an official part of Dibao that published periodically, which involved the new edicts, penal laws, political decisions from the emperor on the memorial to the throne (Chinese: Zouzhang/Â•èÁ´†). Memorials to the throne from the local government would be written carefully with the specific honorific format to transmit the information from different regions to the imperial court first, which will be discussed and selected by the imperial court, then transferred to the emperor to review. The memorial to the throne would be published on Dibao with the comments and decisions with the permission of the emperor. Memorials to the throne that were not allowed to publish on Dibao would be marked by the emperor as ‚ÄòLiuzhong (Áïô‰∏≠)‚Äô, which literally means ‚Äòleave in the palace‚Äô, because the content on it was not proper to publish on Dibao. Man, Li. (2012). On Yuan Dynasty ‚ÄòNewspaper‚Äô: The existence of ‚ÄòDibao‚Äô and ‚ÄòGuanbao‚Äô Reexamined. Journal of Song-Yuan Studies, 42, 343-374. doi: https://doi.org/10.1353/sys.2013.0000 Kaiyuan Za bao records a memorial to the throne about a new type of grape brought from the western region in the Han Dynasty, which was marked as reviewed and commented with ‚Äòboring‚Äô by the emperor and not allowed to publish on Dibao. Some memorials to the throne were requested to ‚ÄòLiuzhong‚Äô by the local government as they involved significant national secrets in political and military fields that could not be published to the public. Both the edicts and decisions published on Dibao were used as evidences for the imperial court and government officials to engage the government affairs. = The dynamic of the imperial court = Emperor Taizong of Song ÂÆãÂ§™ÂÆó The dynamic of the imperial court became the official content on Dibao in the Song Dynasty, where the emperor published the changes on the appointment and dismission of the government officials in the imperial court and the local governments. In the Song Dynasty, Emperor Taizu of Song (ÂÆãÂ§™Á•ñ) and Emperor Taizong of Song (ÂÆãÂ§™ÂÆó) enacted the policy of emphasising literature and restricting military force (ÈáçÊñáËºïÊ≠¶) to further enlarge the power of the emperor and weaken the power of the military to prevent the military coup and consolidate the domination of the empire, which led to increasing occupation requirement and the fierce competition of the government officials in the imperial political system. With the rising political party movements and conflicts, the dynamic of the imperial court and the appointment and dismission of the government officials that published on Dibao gradually became the most significant information source for both the civil officials and military officers to know the occupation demand of the government, understand and analyse the political circumstance of the empire in the Song Dynasty. In the Ming Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty, the content published on Dibao related to the dynamic of the imperial court was further divided into three essential parts : Gongmenchao (ÂÆÆÈñÄÈàî), Shangyu (‰∏äË´≠) and Zouzhang (Â•èÁ´†).Brook, T. (Ed.). (1998). Spring: The Middle Century (1450-1550) (pp. 86-152). The confusions of pleasure: commerce and culture in Ming China. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. Gongmenchao, literally means ‚Äòthe paper in the palace‚Äô, involved the specific information about the imperial court and the appointment and dismission of the government officials, which would be discussed by the officials and selected by the emperor to publish on Dibao. Zouzhang, which is the memorial to the throne delivered to the emperor, would be selected, commented, then permitted by the emperor to publish on Dibao usually without the discussion with the government officials. Shangyu, which literally means ‚Äòthe edict of the emperor‚Äô, was the decisions that the emperor made on the memorials to the throne, which usually were the praises, awards, and the appointment and dismission of the government officials. = The report of military and diplomacy = The content related to the military, diplomacy and natural disaster that published on Dibao was controlled strictly on every imperial dynasty, which aimed to maintain the feudal governance, safeguard the interest of the ruling class, and ensure the stabilisation of the feudal society. Porter, J. (2016). Imperial China, 1350-1900. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield The content about military action, especially related to the mutiny, peasant revolt, and the minority armed resistance, generally would not be allowed to publish on Dibao because they could disturb the popular mind and destroy the societal stabilisation and harmony, which can threaten the imperial regime and the authority of the ruling class directly. The content related to military and diplomacy that published on Dibao would be reviewed by the imperial court first, then further reviewed and selected by the emperor carefully because it was equal to official government documents, which was used as evidence and reference for the local governments to deal with the local affairs that played an important role in the imperial government organisation operation. Fanzhen in the Tang Dynasty  Historical Development  = Tang Dynasty = Both the historians who support the Han Dynasty origin theory and the Tang Dynasty origin theory agree that Dibao was developed in the Tang Dynasty and started to form a stable delivery system between the local government and the central government. In the Tang Dynasty, Fanzhen (Ëó©ÈéÆ), literally means \\"buffer town\\", a governmental administration system through regional governors, was instituted to replace the Jun-Xian system.Hung, H. (2013). Li Shi Min, founding the Tang dynasty the strategies that made China the greatest empire in Asia. New York: Algora Pub. The messengers from different Fanzhens collected the information related to the imperial court and those could be beneficial for their Fanzhens, then wrote them on Dibao and delivered them to the Fanzhens. Dibao in the Tang Dynasty did not publish periodically and did not have fixed content with headings. The imperial court and the emperor did not review and restrict the content written on Dibao because it only represented the Fanzhen governor, which was not the official gazette of the empire. Emperor Ningzong of Song ÂÆãÂØßÂÆó = Song Dynasty = Dibao became the official administrative department governed by the central government in the Song Dynasty, which was the earliest official gazette instituted directly by the central government in the feudal society. Dibao in the Song Dynasty started to publish the content periodically related to the daily life of the emperor, edicts and political decisions, the dynamic of the imperial court, and the reports of military, diplomacy and natural disaster as a result of the ruling classes attached great importance to the function of Dibao, which aimed to transmit the information, consolidate feudal governance, and protect the rights and interests of the ruling classes. In the Song Dynasty, the function of Dibao gradually shifted to maintain the legitimacy of governance rather than supervising the edicts and decisions of the emperor and the government officials due to the development of high centralisation of authority with the policy of emphasising literature and restricting military force (ÈáçÊñáËºïÊ≠¶). The loss of the Northern Expedition war led by the emperor Ningzong of Song (ÂÆãÂØßÂÆó) and the imperial military caused huge casualties, which ignited the anger of the public. A deep self-criticism written by the emperor Ningzong of Song was published on Dibao and delivered to the local governments and shown to the public, which presented the good image of the emperor that aimed to quell the public anger, increase the military morale, and maintain the image of the ruling class. = Ming Dynasty = Wanli Emperor Ëê¨ÊõÜÁöáÂ∏ù/ÊòéÁ•ûÂÆó The social climate and the restriction on the Dibao in the Ming Dynasty were not as strict as the Song Dynasty although it was still aimed to maintain feudal governance of the empire. Historians believe the subtle balance of the power between the emperor and the government officials was because the emperor in the Ming Dynasty understood the importance of the transparent political system as the Ming dynasty was established with the peasant revolt led by the political corrosion and corruption in the Yuan Dynasty. Unlike the Dibao in the Song Dynasty, the content published on Dibao in the Ming Dynasty usually involved the conflicts and argument between the government officials and the emperor, sometimes even had the criticism on the edicts and decisions that the emperor made. Dibao in the Wanli (Ëê¨ÊõÜ) period in the Ming Dynasty published numerous criticism and opposition on the decision that the Wanli Emperor (ÊòéÁ•ûÂÆó/Ëê¨ÊõÜÁöáÂ∏ù) planned to give the position of the crown prince to the son of imperial noble consort Zheng rather than the son of the empress, which against the imperial law and led to the strong dissatisfaction of the public opinion and the government officials that forced the Wanli emperor to withdrawal his decision. In the 16th century before the establishment of the Qing Dynasty, Nurhaci (Âä™ÁàæÂìàËµ§), the chieftain of Manchuria who afterward became the first emperor in the Qing Dynasty, dispatched many spies to buy Dibao in the Ming empire to collect the useful information due to high transparency it had. = Qing Dynasty = The emperor in the Qing Dynasty became the editor in chief of Dibao who completely controlled and managed the imperial propaganda and public opinion.Mittler, B. (2004). A Newspaper for China? Power, Identity, and Change in Shanghai‚Äôs News Media,1872-1912. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Asia Centre. Dibao in the Qing Dynasty still had the right to publish the criticism and opposition like the Ming Dynasty, but they were all reviewed and selected by the emperor before publishing. Jingbao (Peking Gazette/‰∫¨Â†±), which literally means 'reports of the capital‚Äô, became one of the imperial gazettes to publish with Dibao at the same time.Harris, L. J. (2018). The Peking Gazette. Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill. The content published on Jingbao only involved the edicts and decisions, which was used as Bulletin Board for the public and foreign ambassadors. The content published on other Dibao was also allowed to only involve the edicts and decisions, which would be also selected by the emperor that aimed to make the content on all Dibao become the same as Jingbao and controlled all content published on each Dibao to further control the public opinion and consolidate feudal governance. In the Qing Dynasty, publishers who published the content without the permission of the emperor on Dibao would be sentenced because it was a crime.

Such boilers are used to generate steam for process purposes in many locations, for example laundries, food processing factories and hospitals. Although they are more expensive to run than gas-fired or oil-fired boilers they are popular because of their simplicity and ease of use. Because of the large currents required, they are normally run from a three-phase electricity supply. They convert electrical energy into thermal energy with almost 100% efficiency but the overall thermal efficiency is variable, depending on the efficiency with which the electricity is generated. Making steam with an electric boiler The process of creating steam with an electric boiler is fairly simple. Electricity is run through a heating element that acts as a resistor to create heat through resistance. Water from the system or holding tank is then run over or near this hot element in a pipe or tank, heating the water to a suitable temperature, then making the water hot enough to boil and become saturated steam,Stultz, S. C. (1992). Steam: its generation and use. (40 ed., Vol. 1). Barberton: The Babcock & Wilcox Company. at which point the saturated steam is transported to wherever it is needed via the steam pipes that exit the body of the electric boiler. Electric steam boilers work in a very similar way to fire heated boilers with the exception of what heats the water. Advantages Some experts that work with boilers on a day- to-day basis feel that electric boilers are actually superior to fuel heated boilers in a few ways. Those experts say that using electric boilers may actually be cheaper than using a fuel heated boiler, while also possibly being much more environmentally friendly. The electric boilers also require less equipment to be installed than a traditional boiler helping to reduce the high installation costs that will come with a fuel heated boiler. Electric Boilers can fit into smaller areas due to the way they are constructed and the lack of required parts that a fuel heated boiler requires to operate. =Safety of operation of electric boilers over fuel heated boilers= Traditional fuel- heated boilers generally require multiple different parts to operate successfully. In contrast, electric boilers are relatively simple devices. Additionally, because electric boilers do not use complicated forms of heat exchange, electric boilers do not contain many of the potential hazards that are commonly present in a fuel-heated boiler. Electric boilers are also generally easier to maintain because they do not need tube replacement, which fuel-heated boilers often require due to soot and fuel residue, or any of the fire maintenance required for a fuel-heated boiler. Electric boilers also have smaller carbon footprints than their traditional cousins, fuel-heated steam boilers, and require less space overall, making them a good choice for smaller operations that are in need of a boiler. =Other benefits= Some other possible benefits that should be considered are sustainability, due to their low maintenance requirements; marketability, due to the idea that \\"green\\" is better; and safety, because it is not as dangerous to run as a traditional fire heated boiler. =Sustainability= Electric steam boilers are more efficient than fire-heated boilers because they require less energy to be put into them for operation at capacity. This is because there is little energy lost when the transfer of heat from the heating element to the water occurs, unlike traditional fire heated boilers, where there is a substantial amount of energy loss from the air flow required to supply oxygen to the flame.Malek, M. (2005). Boiler Design. Power boiler design, inspection and repair (). New York: McGraw-Hill. However, if the electricity is generated by a thermal power plant, then the whole system is less efficient than a fire-heated boiler due to the greater inefficiency of the power plant. Therefore, use of electric boilers can actually consume more fuel if the electricity is generated by burning fuels. Electric steam boilers are more easily marketable (than fire- heated boilers) to people that would use them for small applications, because it can be sold with the idea that it is \\"green\\" and therefore much better for the environment than buying and operating a fire heated boiler. Disadvantages Electric boilers are sometimes looked down upon by some experts for multiple factors. These factors stem from the fact that the electricity that is used to power electric steam boilers has to be generated somewhere. As well as the use of electricity is its cost, especially considering that most electric boilers require a good deal of electricity to run at efficient and full capacity. Generating the power required to run an electric boiler can create just as much - if not more - pollution/emissions than burning fuel in a traditional boiler. Electricity is expensive, and with expected rises in the price of electricity, the use of it in electric boilers will come with a large price.Junge, S. (2009). Cost-effective electric boilers.Heating/Piping/Air Conditioning Engineering,81(1), BSE22-BSE26. Although there is an argument that in the event of a power outage or brownout the boiler would become unusable (in comparison to gas boilers), in fact both systems need an external power source to run, such as for pumps and valve operation and controlJunge, S.

Types Small electric water boilers are portable household appliances, used to prepare hot beverages or other food items. They may provide a reservoir of hot water to be kept at a fixed temperature or to allow tea to be steeped at a controlled temperature. They are manually filled with water every time hot water is desired. An electric steam boiler is intended to produce steam for process industry or other uses, such as drying, heat treating, and others. These are generally permanently installed systems with connections to a water supply and piping to transport product steam to the point of use. In places where electric power is relatively low cost compared to fossil fuels, it may be economically practical to use an electric boiler for steam central heating. For example, in Winnipeg, Canada, during the Second World War, large central electric steam boilers were used for a district heating system, using surplus hydroelectric power. The intent was to conserve coal fuel for more critical wartime needs. Electric boilers may rely on immersion heater resistance heating elements to heat water, or may use electric current passing directly through the water as an electrode boiler. Carey Merritt, Process Steam Systems: A Practical Guide for Operators, Maintainers, and Designers, John Wiley & Sons, 2015,, pages 78-80 Control and safety Even the tabletop appliance will have a control switch or at least an over temperature cut out to prevent fire if the appliance is started with no water in it. Larger installations have more elaborate controls to ensure that sufficient water supply is available to prevent burn out of the heating elements. These may include interlocks, pressure switches or other measures. A boiler is a pressure vessel and industrial boilers are constructed, operated and inspected in accordance with local regulations to reduce the risk of explosion. For example, permanently installed pressure relief valves will operate if a control malfunction results in excessive pressure in the boiler. Normally resistance heating elements are insulated from the water going through the boiler; sensitive ground fault leakage current detection may be installed to alarm or shut off power if an insulation failure is detected. Electrode boilers put the water supply in direct contact with the electrical supply; current collectors or other features may be provided in piping to prevent dangerous electrical hazards on connected piping. Application issues Any dissolved minerals in the water will be concentrated by the evaporation and will tend to form a scale coating heating surfaces. Even potable water may contain enough minerals to eventually clog or scale a boiler. Household appliances can be cleaned readily, but permanent boiler installations require control of make-up water supply chemistry to reduce scaling. Electric heating is generally highly efficient; since there is no stream of waste combustion gases emitting from the boiler, nearly all the purchased energy appears in the product hot water or steam in useful form. This high efficiency even in small sizes partly offsets the generally higher cost of electric energy compared to fossil fuels. An electric boiler can be placed in operation quickly, as there is no furnace to reach high temperatures. Environmental impact is displaced to the source of the grid electricity; however, if fossil fuel is being consumed to make electricity, overall efficiency will be lower than direct use of the fuel. Operationally, an electric boiler is a convenient process unit that is easy to control and that requires no space for fuel storage nor for an exhaust gas stack. There is no blower for combustion air and only minimal pumps required for operation, so the boiler is quiet.

Originally commissioned to take the French Caribbean island of Martinique, they were shipped instead to Western Europe. With an initial strength of 800 officers and enlisted men, the remaining 250 members of the Battalion were ordered on 7 January 1945 to attack the Belgian village of Rochelinval over open ground and without artillery support. During the successful assault the unit lost more than half its remaining men. The Battalion was inactivated on 27 January 1945 and the remaining 110 survivors were absorbed into the 82nd Airborne Division. Virtually nothing of the unit's history was known to the American public until the 1990s when renewed interest prompted its veterans to seek recognition for their costly success at Rochelinval. The battalion was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation in 2001 recognizing its accomplishment. Combat operations *Italian Campaign *Operation Dragoon, with Arrowhead *Battle of the Bulge Activation and training The 1st Battalion, 551st Parachute Infantry Regiment was activated on 26 November 1942 at Fort Kobbe in the Panama Canal Zone. Its initial cadre came from Company C of the 501st Parachute Infantry Battalion, while the rest of that battalion was absorbed into the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment. Its first draft of new men was gathered in the Frying Pan Area of Fort Benning, Georgia, on 30 October 1942. Those personnel were trained as paratroopers through the Parachute School Replacement Pool in November‚ÄìDecember 1942. Leaving Fort Benning on 11 December, they passed through Richmond and staged at Camp Patrick Henry, near Newport News, Virginia, arriving there on 13 December. While at Camp Patrick Henry, the men picked up a unique mascot, a short-haired black and tan dachshund puppy they stole from the yard of the port commander. They named her Furlough, which was the thing the men most desired. Under strict orders of secrecy, they could not wear their hard-won airborne insignia, had to hide their newly acquired tattoos that revealed their military affiliation, and were prohibited from leaving the base. =Prepared to take Martinique= Upon arrival in Panama, they trained for approximately eight months in jungle warfare to prepare for a planned invasion of the Vichy French island of Martinique begun. On 13 May 1943, the Battalion was put on alert for a possible drop on Martinique. The island was being utilized as a re-supply base for German U-boat submarines in the Caribbean Sea. The Battalion's presence in Panama had been kept secret until around that time, when they were part of a special review in Balboa, Panama for the president of Colombia. Publicizing their presence at this point was part of an effort to put psychological pressure on the Vichy administration in Martinique. Before the mission could be initiated, the island government joined the Free French in 1943, and the invasion was canceled. The battalion left Panama in August 1943. En route, the ship's crew discovered the dog, and the ship's Master-at-Arms ordered the dog thrown overboard. Lieutenant Colonel Wood Joerg, the Battalion's commanding officer, earned a great deal of his men's loyalty and fierce respect when he successfully faced down the Master, risking a court-martial, and the crew was able to keep their mascot. They arrived at Camp Mackall, North Carolina, the same month. The 551st Parachute Infantry Regiment never gained regimental strength and was re-designated as the 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion. =Origin of their nickname= One of Colonel Joerg's favorite expressions was \\"Get off your ass!‚Äù. Given the Army's penchant for acronyms, soon the men were referring to themselves as \\"GOYA birds\\", or simply GOYAs. =Return to the United States= Lieutenant Colonel Wood Joerg, the popular commanding officer of the 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion. He was killed during the unit's assault on Rochelinval on 7 January 1945. On 20 August 1943, the Battalion along with their sister unit, the 550th Airborne Infantry Battalion was sent to Camp Mackall, North Carolina for additional training. Lieutenant Colonel Rupert D. Graves replaced Lieutenant Colonel Wood Joerg in October 1943. This including training in night jumping on 16 February 1944. While at Camp Mackall the battalion was assigned to the Airborne Command. The unit underwent intense training and was selected to participate in testing the feasibility of using gliders as paratroop transport. The battalion received a personnel commendation from Airborne Commander Major General Eldridge G. Chapman. During training in North Carolina, the 551st PIB were the first American paratroopers to jump out of military gliders. The experiment was a failure as there was no slipstream leading the men to fall straight, and the glider's flimsy construction led to the anchor line cable ripping out of the inside when the men jumped.Orfalea, Gregory Messengers of the Lost Battalion 1999 Touchstone In March 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Joerg rejoined the unit, and on 23 April 1944, the Battalion departed Norfolk, Virginia for Italy. Transiting through Oran, North Africa, the Battalion arrived in Naples on 23 May 1944. They trained at Camp Wright in Trapani and Marsala, Sicily during June 1944, before moving to Lido di Roma, near Rome in July. The 551st was attached to six different American units during World War II. Combat in southern France Members of the 551st Parachute Infantry Regiment on patrol in the French Alps during World War II. As a non-divisional unit for the entire war, the Battalion was attached to the provisional 1st Airborne Task Force for the Allied invasion of southern France in August 1944. On 15 August 1944, the 551st finally got into the war with their first combat jump during Operation Dragoon. They liberated Draguignan, France on 15 August 1944 and on 29 August, they liberated Nice. From 15 August 1944 through 17 November 1944, the 551st, along with the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion and the 550th Airborne Infantry Battalion, protected the right flank of the U.S. Seventh Army in the French-Italian Alps as mountain troops against the Austrian 5th Gebirgsjaeger Division. On 22 November 1944 the Battalion was attached to the U.S. 101st Airborne Division. The Battalion then moved to Laon in northern France on 8 December 1944, and on 19 December 1944 were suddenly summoned to help stem the Ardennes offensive. The Battle of the Bulge Men of the 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion moving up to the line of battle early in the Battle of the Bulge, before the weather turned, December 1944. On 21 December the 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion was reassigned to the U.S. 30th Infantry Division reinforcing their positions in and around Rahier, Stoumont, La Gleize, Francorchamps, Ster and Stavelot, Belgium. The 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion arrived in Werbomont, Belgium and entered the Battle of the Bulge on 21 December 1944 with a strength of more than 643 officers and enlisted men. The 551st were the initial spearhead in U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps's counter- offensive on the northern shoulder of the Bulge. Their first days in the Battle of the Bulge were, according to paratrooper Don Garrigues, miserable: \\"no sleep, frozen feet, trench foot, knee deep snow, cold food and hallucinations.\\" He had a vivid memory of that Christmas Eve: On 26 December, they reported near Basse-Bodeux to the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, part of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division. They received a visit from Major General James Gavin, commanding general of the 82nd Airborne, who visited their bivouac at Rahier on 27 December. He told the Battalion that it had been chosen to make the initial \\"raid in force\\" against the Germans. He told them they would be the unit who was going to turn the battle around. He stressed that they might take very heavy casualties but that a great deal depended on the outcome. Their task was to pass through the U.S. Army's forward lines, cross about into German-held territory, and attack and reduce the German-held village of Noirefontaine. They were then to return to base with prisoners for interrogation. The evening of the next day they carried out the raid against the Oberst Friederich Kittel's 62nd Volksgrenadier Division in the tiny hamlet of Noirefontaine, taking 18 casualties in the process. They faced Kittel's stubborn troops again. From 3‚Äì8 January 1945, they assaulted the small hamlets of Mont-de-Fosse, St. Jacques, and Dairomont. According to the unit's Presidential Unit Citation, \\"On 4 January, the battalion conducted a rare fixed bayonet attack of machine gun nests that killed 64 Germans.\\" Fighting through the thick woods cost the 551st heavy casualties. On the morning of 7 January, down to only 250 men, they were next charged with taking the village of Rochelinval, Belgium, along the Salm River. The defending 183rd Volksgrenadier Regiment was backed up by a regiment of 88mm guns and a battalion of 105mm howitzers. Colonel Joerg had requested preparatory artillery which was not forthcoming. He requested that the attack be delayed, and his request was denied. He thought the attack, down slope by his un- camouflaged men in the daylight across a half-mile expanse of foot-deep snow at a concealed, alert enemy, to be suicidal. Their only cover would be their 81mm mortars. Paratrooper Don Garrigues wrote: While victorious in capturing Rochelinval and eliminating the last German bridgehead for over on the Salm River, the unit was virtually eliminated, having suffered more than 85% casualties. Relieved on 9 January 1945, of the 643 men who entered the battle on 3 January, only 14 Officers and 96 men remained. \\"Nowhere were casualties higher than in Wood Joerg's 551st Battalion.\\" Quoting Ridgeways' Paratroopers by Clay Blair. Like the independent 509th Infantry Battalion, the unit's strength had been overwhelmed by battle, and paratrooper replacements were not in the pipeline. Battalion disbanded On 27 January 1945, in Juslenville, Belgium, General James M. Gavin informed the remaining men that the battalion was being inactivated and all remaining soldiers would be absorbed into the 82nd Airborne Division. The unit records were absorbed into the 82nd Airborne and virtually lost for many years, their sacrifice unknown to many. Casualties Because the unit was disbanded and its remaining men absorbed into various units, U.S. Army records on the number of casualties are conflicting.

During food preparation or cooking, they may also be added in combination. Salt and pepper are typically maintained in separate shakers on the table, but they may be mixed in the kitchen. They are typically found in a set (pair), often a matched set, of salt and pepper shakers. They may be considered condiments or seasonings; salt is a mineral and black pepper is a spice.  History  The pairing of salt and pepper as table accessories dates to seventeenth-century French cuisine, which considered black pepper (distinct from herbs such as fines herbes) the only spice that did not overpower the true taste of food. Some food writers like Sara Dickerman have argued that, in modern cookery, a new spice could be used in place of the historic ground black pepper.

After living briefly in Nigeria he moved to Britain and continued his studies at the University of Southampton and at Imperial College, London. Philosophy Balmond sees his work as an open-ended visual application of theory, following the principle that \\"structure as conceptual rigour is architecture\\". His approach to structure is derived by theories of complexity, non-linear organisation and emergence. Through his research, Balmond investigates mathematical concepts and their influence on natural forms and structures, interrogating algorithms, fractals, rhythm and cellular structure. Life and work CCTV Headquarters Ove Arup & Partners Balmond was deputy chairman at Arup. The AGU at Arup brought together architects, mathematicians, programmers, artists, musicians and scientists. It investigated structural systems, delving in the basin of order and patterns and engaging with music, algorithms, and malignant cellular structure to create abstract concepts that inspired tectonic forms.http://www.arup.com/ Under Balmond's artistic direction at the AGU, Balmond worked on some of the world's most famous structures including the Centre Pompidou-Metz with Shigeru Ban and CCTV Headquarters with Rem Koolhaas.

It is native to North and Central America where it is widespread from Canada to Guatemala. It lives submersed in freshwater such as rivers and lakes. It is quite variable in appearance. The leaves are different sizes and shapes across individuals, partly genetic variation and partly response to water conditions, for example, the speed and turbulence of surrounding currents. Submersed individuals also have a different stem and leaf morphology from those that occur partially or completely out of the water. The inflorescence bears a single short-lived flower that blooms in the morning and wilts in the evening. It has six yellow perianth parts each less than a centimeter long spreading from a tubular throat one to seven centimeters long. There are three long, thick yellow stamens with curling anthers and one yellow style. The fruit is a capsule containing many winged seeds. The plant sometimes has galls in its tissue, which are caused by the parasitic fungus Membranosorus heterantherae.

History  The 8th Connecticut Infantry Regiment was organized at Camp Buckingham, Hartford, in September, 1861, It was first commanded by Colonel Edward Harland of Norwich. The regiment drew most of its enlisted men from northern Hartford and Litchfield counties and was composed mostly of merchants and farmers from the Housatonic River and Connecticut River Valleys south to near New Milford and north to the Massachusetts state line and west to present day Hartford. The regiment had many free black men as well. The regiment left Hartford October 17, 1861, for a camp of instruction at Jamaica, Long Island, and there received its colors. It proceeded to Annapolis, where it spent the fall. Early in January, 1862, the Eighth sailed with the Burnside Expedition to North Carolina as part of the IX Corps. It was held in reserve during the Battle of Roanoke Island.Eighth Regiment Connecticut Volunteers, Co.A, Inc It was engaged in the Battle of New Bern, on March 14, 1862. The Eighth then participated in the successful siege of Fort Macon, during the March and April 1862. From there the regiment proceeded to Fredericksburg in July, 1862. On September 1 the Eighth accompanied the Union Army to Washington, and on September 8, joined the Maryland Campaign, including action at South Mountain. The Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, resulted in a greater number of casualties for the regiment than any other engagement of the war. Along with other regiments of Harland's Brigade, the Eighth marched downstream from Burnside's Bridge, and crossed the Antietam at Snaveley's Ford. They proceeded up the slopes towards Sharpsburg to attack the Confederates, finally being repulsed by reinforcements under Gen. A. P. Hill at the close of the day's fighting. After Antietam, the Eighth stayed in Pleasant Valley until marching back to Fredericksburg, with the Army of the Potomac, assuming their old camps at the Lacey House. Soon it was involved in the contested crossing of the Rappahannock, where over 80 men of the Eighth volunteered to assist the engineers in building the pontoon bridges. The Battle of Fredericksburg followed on December 13, 1862, and they were moved towards Marye's Heights in the last assault. However darkness fell and the Eighth only advanced as far as the bed of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, never having been heavily engaged. Following their participation in Burnside's Mud March, the Eighth left of the IX Corps early in 1863, and went to Newport News, then to Suffolk, Virginia. They participated in the siege there for several months. It was there that the Eighth, now under Col. John Ward, attacked Fort Huger and took it by surprise in a daring raid. The regiment remained in the Portsmouth area during the summer, and participated in the \\"Blackberry Raid\\" demonstration in force. In December 1863, 310 original members of the regiment re-enlisted, and in January were sent home on veteran furloughs. Those who had volunteered in 1862 and 1863 were temporarily transferred to the 15th Connecticut and remained in southeastern Virginia. The year of 1864 found the Eighth transferred to the XVIII Corps, Army of the James. There they participated in the battles of Walthall Junction, Fort Darling, Drewry's Bluff, Cold Harbor, and the siege of Petersburg. In September, they served on Bermuda Hundred, and across the James River. September 29 they fought at the battles of Fort Harrison and Chaffin's Farm, which was their last engagement of the war. The Eighth was with the 24th Corps, Army of the James in its final advance on Richmond in the spring of 1865. After Gen. Lee's surrender at Appomattox, the Eighth moved to Lynchburg, Virginia, where it performed police and provost duties until it was mustered out of service December 12, 1865, serving a longer term than all but two other Connecticut regiments.

Biography Plummer was born in Barre, Massachusetts, and educated in the common schools. He taught school for several years. In 1837, he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy and graduated in 1841.Warner, Ezra J. Generals in Blue: Lives of the Union Commanders. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1964. . pp. 374-375. He received a brevet rank of second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Infantry and served on garrison duty. He missed the first year of the Mexican- American War due to sickness. Plummer did quartermaster duty on the Texas frontier from 1848 until 1861. In 1852, he was promoted to a captain in the 1st U.S. Infantry. He married Frances Hagner; they had a son, Satterlee Clark Plummer, who later also became an officer in the U.S. Army after graduating from West Point in 1865. He was wounded at the Battle of Wilson's Creek while commanding a battalion of Regulars. Plummer was commissioned as the colonel of the 11th Missouri Volunteers in September 1861 and assigned command of the post at Cape Girardeau, Missouri, a position he filled until March 1862. Then, he was appointed as a brigadier general, U.S. Volunteers on March 11, 1862. In April 1862, Plummer was promoted to major of the 8th U.S. Infantry in the Regular Army. Later, Plummer commanded the 5th Division of Pope's army at New Madrid and the Island Number Ten campaign. He subsequently commanded a brigade of Stanley's division at Corinth and died in camp at Corinth on August 9, 1862 (exactly one year after Wilson's Creek) from lingering effects of his wounds and prolonged exposure in the field.

History  Stokesay Court was built by the rich Victorian era merchant, philanthropist, social conservative, Christian evangelist and church-builder John Derby Allcroft. He had had London churches built including St Matthew's, Bayswater, St Jude's Church, Kensington (now St Mellitus College), and St Martin's, Gospel Oak and served as Treasurer and major benefactor to Christ's Hospital school. He purchased the estate (including Stokesay Castle, which he felt unsuitable to reside in) and a small house (too small for his large family) in 1868, a smaller adjoining site in 1874, and non-adjoining land that he chose for his mansion in 1886. The site looks out over Ludlow and the Clee Hills. Work lasted from 1889 to 1892 under the architect Thomas Harris, finishing only six months before Derby Allcroft's death. The house was one of England's first to have integral electric light, installed by Edmundsons in 1891. The house passed to John's son Herbert and then grandchildren Russell and then Jewell Magnus, acting as an Auxiliary Military Hospital for convalescent soldiers during the First World War and as a temporary home for the evacuated students of Lancing College and a Western Command Junior Leaders‚Äô School during the Second World War. Rotating living in parts of the house in the inter-war and post-war periods, the family sold the house's original contents in a four day sale at Sotheby's in 1994 to fund building repairs.

With an embargo in effect various companies also supplied Iraq and Iran by shipping materials through third-party countries and from those countries to the belligerents. While some of this exporting was legal, permitted or tolerated by parliament, Iraqi clandestine procurement operations were especially active in Britain. Motives for policy towards Iraq In spite of the British embargo, both the Iraqis and Iranians purchased British goods, from BMARC and other countries, using false end user certificates citing the destination as Singapore, Jordan or South Africa. Economically, Britain wanted to continue an export trade with Iran and Iraq, which accounted for a total of 1 billion pounds per year. These guidelines, according to evidence to the Scott arms-to-Iraq inquiry, were subsequently secretly relaxed. After \\"The United Nations imposed an embargo, to try to restore stability to the region. Britain imposed its own rules‚Äîknown as the \\"Howe guidelines\\" after the then Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe‚Äîrestricting exports. While there was a strict ban on \\"lethal\\" exports, there was more flexibility if the proposed export, in the Government's view, would not prolong or exacerbate the conflict. =Export guidelines= It was later established that guidelines had been established but not followed. The Scott report showed that the \\"Howe Principles\\", or the \\"Government's stated policy on arms sales to Iran and Iraq was set out by Lord Howe in October 1985 when he was Foreign Secretary. He informed the House of the following set of guidelines to all deliveries of defence equipment to Iran and Iraq, implemented in December 1984 ...\\" had not been followed. The Guidelines were: :#We should maintain our consistent refusal to supply any lethal equipment to either side; :#Subject to that overriding consideration, we should attempt to fulfil existing contracts and obligations; :# We should not, in future, approve orders for any defence equipment which, in our view, would significantly enhance the capability of either side to prolong or exacerbate the conflict; :#In the line with this policy, we should continue to scrutinise rigorously all applications for export licences for the supply of defence equipment to Iran and Iraq. =Scott report= The \\"Scott report\\" on British sales to Iraq, of \\"non-lethal\\" military-related goods, as distinct from actual weapons, which took three years to prepare under the direction of senior high court judge Sir Richard Scott, criticized government handling, but also rejected that Members of Parliament tried to bias the court trying the Matrix Churchill defendants. In particular, it singled out Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell and Treasury Chief Secretary William Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill for their errors. One of the main problems highlighted in the report was the decision of the government not to inform Parliament of reforms to arms export laws for fear of public outcry. The report concluded government policy towards the export of non-lethal military goods was changed following the Iran‚ÄìIraq ceasefire in 1988, in a way that should have been reported to the Commons. Scott's report explained the British government's secret decision to supply Saddam with even more weapons-related equipment after the Halabja chemical weapon on Iraqi Kurds by their own government. Former Foreign Secretary Howe had written that the ceasefire ending the Iran‚ÄìIraq War could mean \\"major opportunities for British industry\\" An official working for Howe, and quoted in the Scott Report, indicated Howe such an initiative kept quiet: \\"It could look very cynical if so soon after expressing outrage about the treatment of the Kurds, we adopt a more flexible approach to arms sales.\\" Export controls Member of Parliament Roger Berry, speaking in the House of Commons, said that the only truly important thing about export control is the identity of the true end user, who may not be the country on the end user certificate. \\"As the arms to Iraq scandal taught us, what matters is who gets the arms and what they do with them. The licence application might have said that the weapons were going to Jordan, but they ended up in Iraq.? He said the end-use information on the export license needs to be verified. According to Berry, there \\"is no point [to] the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) ticking the box and saying, \\"They say this is going to our friendly neighbour Austria,\\" or, \\"This is going to our dear old friend Singapore.\\" From some statistics, it seems that Singapore has the largest navy, air force and army in the world.... I simply urge the Minister to give us some information on how the Government go about end-use monitoring. Especially on the financial side, there was a complex interaction between Iraqi-controlled organizations in the U.K. and U.S. One established British company, Matrix Churchill was bought by Iraq, its British branch an important manufacturer of advanced machine tools, and its American subsidiary used as a conduit for procurement in the U.S. Originally a well-established U.K. manufacturer of machine tools with a U.S. subsidiary, the firm had the U.S. operation greatly enlarged by Iraqis, using U.S. financing for Iraqi purchases that did not necessarily involve the U.K. According to the Scott report, executives of Matrix-Churchill were charged for attempting to export arms without the required permission of Parliament. Under the changed rules, which had not been disclosed to Parliament, it was determined they had acted legally, and the Government was aware of the planned exports. One of the criticisms in the Scott report was the government's attempt to obtain Public Interest Immunity (PII) certificate during the trial. Such certificates prevent the disclosure of documents showing a relationship between the defendants and British intelligence services. While the report did not suggest there was any attempt to punish innocent men, Scott's report said that the Crown prosecutors should have been told that Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine was reluctant to use such a certificate. =Iraqi clandestine procurement techniques= There are several ways to use front companies. A company can be created for the purpose, or the nation interested in the products may take over an existing company. On occasion, an expert can be hired to give an existing company a new capability, or a new company can be built around an established expert, such as Gerald Bull. Iraq's Nasr State Enterprise for Mechanical Industries was the main producer of Iraqi missiles and was heavily involved in clandestine nuclear and chemical weapons technology acquisition. It probably controlled the al-Arabi Trading Company. =Creating companies= Anees Mansour Wadi, an Iraqi expatriate, set up front companies all over Europe, which could be listed as end-users for a broad range of technology and items. In Britain, he teamed with the British businessman Roy Ricks, to form Meed International, Ltd, which was renamed to Technology Engineering Group (TEG). According to Iraq's declaration to the IAEA Action Team, Iraqis went to the United Kingdom and worked with Wadi to procure items for the gaseous diffusion and the Beams-type centrifuge uranium enrichment programs. TEG bought a total of 75 items for these programs at a cost of about 1.25 million British pounds, and shipped the items to the Nassr. =Buying partial or complete control of established companies= The Al-Arabi Trading Co. was headquartered in Baghdad, and appears to have been under the control of Iraq's main weapons complex, the Nassr State Enterprise for Mechanical Industries. In 1987, Al-Arabi set up its main procurement front in London, a holding company called Technology Development Group or TDG. In 1987, TDG set up a firm called TMG Engineering [TMG] which was the vehicle used to purchase a well-established British machine tool maker Matrix-Churchill Ltd. and its Cleveland, OH, affiliate Matrix-Churchill Corp. Al-Arabi has been banned from business with U.S. organizations at least since 1997. Matrix Churchill In 1987, the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6) reported that British machine tool companies were selling equipment to Iraqi arms factories, including Matrix Churchill Ltd. [MCL], the United Kingdom's premier toolmaker and a major supplier of machine tools to arsenals around the world. It has been in existence since 1913 and its two plants in the United Kingdom employed over 700 people. Matrix-Churchill Corp. was the U.S. sales and service affiliate of MCL and it was established in Cleveland, OH, in 1967. The military uses of Matrix-Churchill machines are the prime reason Iraq was interested in purchasing the company. Acquiring Matrix-Churchill gave Iraq access, not only to the machine tools, but also the computer programming, tooling, and other components needed to make a wide variety of munitions as well as other applications in aerospace and nuclear industries. The purchase could be construed as one big intelligence gathering operation for Iraq. When Iraq gained control of MCC, it reoriented the firm such that the general market was no longer its priority, but to meet Iraq's needs. MCC's sales and service operations were dropped, but the Iraqis also set up a project management division within Matrix-Churchill in 1988. That division obtained technology for Iraqi arms complexes like NASSR and Hutteen. The project management division was established to manage the activities of United States companies that won contracts to work in Iraq. The BNL-financed glass fiber factory at Nassr was the project management division's biggest project. Iraqi organizations that wanted products made in the US would send the request to Iraqi managers in Matrix-Churchill's procurement division, established in 1987, which would identify and evaluate sources in the United States, unless the UK division of Matrix-Churchill could make them. In some cases, the US side of Matrix-Churchill would buy the equipment in other cases. In other cases, Matrix-Churchill acted as a broker for the Iraqi end user, and Matrix- Churchill demanded and often received a kickback from the United States firm of between 5 and 10 percent of the total value of the contract. These kickbacks were intended to cover the cost of operating the procurement department. The project management division, was under Sam Naman and Abdul Qaddum, who were believed to be an Iraqi intelligence operatives, having worked in the United Kingdom for the known Iraqi intelligence operative Safa Al Habobi, the front man who helped set up and operate the Al Arabi procurement network. Al Habobi was the owner of record of Matrix-Churchill Corp., and several other Iraqi front companies in the United States. According to Gonzales, Qaddumi and Naman had previously worked together, \\"contrary to what they told the American employees working at Matrix-Churchill. The Iraqis working at Matrix-Churchill often talked about sensitive topics in Arabic rather than English. In addition, much of the correspondence related to sensitive matters such as discussions with Safa Al Habobi about money were written in Arabic to conceal the contents from the Americans working at MCC...In a July 10, 1989, memo, Al Habobi instructed employees of Matrix- Churchill to retain certain expense reports in Baghdad because they indicated that the Baghdad branch of Matrix-Churchill was paying various expenses of Iraqi military establishments. The memo stated: > There is some doubt here about the bills being presented in full (to Matrix- > Churchill) as they are from Military companies that we feel, if they are > translated by your accountants, cause you a few problems. BMARC, Astra and Oerlikon One of the arrangements came to light in 1995, regarding a company called BMARC. Previously owned by the Swiss arms manufacturer, Oerlikon, it was sold to the British Astra Holdings in May 1988. Apparently, Oerlikon continued as a partner in some transactions. Astra executives and non-executive directors were well-connected to the British defense industry. It was not always clear, to the Government, if a project was being managed by BMARC, Astra, or, outside the UK, Oerlikon. \\"No one has yet mentioned that when the contract for that was signed the project was being handled by, and BMARC belonged to, Oerlikon, which is a Swiss company. It was not until nearly two years after that contract was entered into that the new management of Astra, headed by Mr. James, bought BMARC and continued with that contract. By 1988 the intelligence community realised that Oerlikon‚Äînot a British company‚Äîwas exporting arms via Singapore to Iran but it did not specifically mention BMARC. His misfortune was that his very successful company, Astra, made two unfortunate purchases‚ÄîBMARC and the other company that supplied the Iraqi gun, PRB. Various Cabinet ministers said the guidelines were being followed, when current evidence shows they were not. In August 1991, the Government told the Select Committee on Trade and Industry: Our examination of the records shows that the policy announced in Parliament in 1985 was adhered to both in the spirit and in the letter\\". Successful export control with Canira While this took place slightly after the end of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, another illustrative example was Iraq's interested in composite materials for its missile program. In the summer of 1989, TDG and Space Research Corporation (SRC), purchased the former Learfan factory in Northern Ireland under the name of Canira, Ltd. Learfan would fabricate carbon fiber composite materials Canira Ltd submitted an application to the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board for financial assistance towards establishing a facility at the factory to produce components for the international aviation industry. When the British government discovered TDC and SRC owned Canira, they stopped financial assistance, on the grounds \\"we have reason to believe that Canira's primary objective is to use the plant to gain experience in composite manufacture for the Iraqi missile program. Composites can also be used in the manufacture of ballistic missiles. In particular, they are a key component in the manufacture of heat shields for warhead reentry vehicles.\\" There are other applications in advanced weapons. Frustrated in getting financial assistance, Iraqi officials decided to have TDG and SRC sell their interest, realizing a significant profit =Hiring experts= Technical experts can provide invaluable assistance to proliferant states, particularly those lacking specialized knowledge about nuclear areas. As a result, proliferant programs have invested considerable effort in recruiting experts. Recruiting experts can be difficult and sometimes success depends on luck more than plans. In any case, knowledge of foreign industries and experts can be the starting point for a recruitment effort. In addition, trusted agents have been approached to find other experts. Iraq was fortunate to have recruited three extraordinarily knowledgeable experts to help its gas centrifuge uranium enrichment program in the period 1988-1990. Walter Busse, Bruno Stemmler, and Karl Heinz Schaab had worked for years at MAN New Technology in Munich Germany, an important subcontractor to the German Urenco partner. Iraq recruited these experts through H&H; Metalform. Urenco How much and exactly what type of assistance these three individuals provided Iraq has been intensively studied for over a decade. It will probably never be possible to develop an entirely consistent and complete picture of what they provided to Iraq. But it is clear that these experts provided a considerable amount of sensitive information about Urenco Group gas centrifuges. Urenco is owned by Ultra-Centrifuge Nederland (Dutch), Uranit GmbH (German) and British Nuclear Fuels plc (UK) in three equal shares. The assistance was broad in scope, occurred regularly in the period 1988‚Äì1990, and included many advanced Urenco technologies. The level of assistance provided by these three experts was key to progress in the Iraqi gas centrifuge program. These three experts provided the Iraqi gas centrifuge program with classified design drawings of centrifuges developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s and a newer, advanced design from the mid-1980s. =Working with middlemen= Proliferant states often seek middlemen to facilitate the acquisition of sensitive items. In some cases, the middlemen obtain an item and transport it to the proliferant state. Other times, an agent merely puts the proliferant state in contact with a supplier who then provides the item. Although the item may be controlled, it is just as likely not to require an export license. The motivation for a middleman is usually money. A country may use a middleman to disguise the true end-user of an item. A supplier may have previously dealt with a particular middleman and may accept the middleman's explanation of the end user. The following examples of Iraqi efforts serve to illustrate a range of activities of middlemen. Buying maraging steel  Iraq used a complex set of intermediaries to buy maraging steel, a critical and export controlled materials. Maraging steel is extremely strong, and is used in applications as minor as high-quality golf clubs and vehicle transmissions, as well as militarily critical components for uranium enrichment centrifuges, cannon, missile casings. In 1989, through a complex set of companies, Iraq purchased 10 Aluminum tubes and carbon fiber composites (see Canira, a British company created by a British firm) are also used in gas centrifuges. See the complex transactions in the article on French support to Iraq. The transactions eventually involved organizations in Iraq, France, West Germany, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Dubai, Jersey, and the United States. Land warfare \\"In 1986, CAAT brought to public attention the attendance at the UK government's British Army Equipment Exhibition of an Iraqi delegation headed by the country's Director of Armaments and Supplies. After an outcry, the invitation to the equivalent naval event the next year was withdrawn.\\" =Tank spares= In 1982 International Military Services (IMS), a company wholly owned by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), was given permission to repair British-made Chieftain tanks in Iraq's possession. The MoD said there had been no abandonment of neutrality, Britain would supply tank spares to both sides but no ammunition. According to a Parliamentary query, \\"International Military Services has signed only one export contract with Iraq since 1980. Details of this were given to the House on 2 July 1991.\\" =Land Rovers and radar= Three hundred military Land Rovers, worth ¬£3 million, and a large quantity of radar equipment said to be worth much more, were sold to Iraq in July 1985 to balance the export of the ships to Iran. (Sunday Telegraph, 28.7.85) Since no details were given it is impossible to tell whether or not the radar mentioned above was the Thorn EMI Cymbeline (radar) battlefield system capable of locating enemy weapons, including artillery and helicopters, and directing the fire of mortars and guns. Iraq is the world's largest user of the Cymbeline system, with an estimated 1,500 systems deployed in Kuwait in early 1991 together with another 1,000 in southern Iraq. Cymbeline was supplied to Iraq during the 1980s and its operators trained in the UK in 1990. (Private Eye, 31.8.90; Thorn EMI Electronics entry, BAEE catalogue 1990; Sunday Times, 2.12.90; Jane's Defence Weekly, 2.2.91) =Marconi Systems artillery weather instruments= Iraq also has the Marconi Command and Control Systems' AMETS which \\"provides the solution for accurate and timely meteorological data needed to ensure accurate file.\\" There is no indication when this might have been sold. (Jane's Defence Weekly, 2.2.91; Marconi catalogue) Naval warfare Air warfare =BAE Hawk= Hawk in British colors. Note that it is a relatively small aircraft The BAE Hawk trainer/light attack aircraft is manufactured only for export from Britain. Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) quoted the Sunday Times to say 20 Iraqi technicians came to the UK a ¬£1 billion deal to establish an aircraft industry in Iraq and to build 300 Hawk jets there under licence. Discussions about this had started in December 1980, just five months after Iraq's invasion of Iran, and British Aerospace employees had been regularly visiting Iraq since March 1981. referenced in CAAT article https://web.archive.org/web/20060225151600/http://www.caat.org.uk/publications/countries/iraq-1991-briefing.php A year later Defence Minister Geoffrey Pattie said: \\"British Aerospace is negotiating with the Government of Iraq for the sale and local assembly of Hawk aircraft. No agreement has yet been reached.\\" referenced in CAAT article https://web.archive.org/web/20060225151600/http://www.caat.org.uk/publications/countries/iraq-1991-briefing.php According to the Financial Times (CAAT), the On 27 July 1989 the Cabinet's Overseas and Defence Committee decided not to allow negotiations on the deal to proceed. The Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry were said to have been swayed by BAe's argument that the Hawk was a trainer and that the sale should go ahead. The UK Foreign Office argued that the Iran- Iraq peace was fragile, and the sale to Iraq might prevent repairing relations with Iran. referenced in CAAT article https://web.archive.org/web/20060225151600/http://www.caat.org.uk/publications/countries/iraq-1991-briefing.php Air defence CAAT cited several British newspapers regarding the July 1981 involvement, with the Iran‚ÄìIraq War underway, of Douglas Hurd, then a Minister of State at the Foreign Office, visited Baghdad to celebrate the anniversary of the Ba'athists' accession to power. Missile and related technology =Supergun= In April 1990, Customs officers at Teesport seized steel pipes, which they said were destined for use in an Iraqi \\"supergun\\". Prosecutions from these and other cases followed. This was despite a secret meeting attended by three ministers, Alan Clark, William Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill and Lord Trefgarne, where it was agreed guidelines to Iraq should be relaxed. This change was never announced in Parliament. Chemical warfare In 1985 a ¬£14m chlorine plant known as \\"Falluja 2\\", built by Uhde Ltd, a UK subsidiary of a German company, was given financial guarantees by the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department despite official UK recognition of a \\"strong possibility\\" the plant would be used to make mustard gas. The guarantees led to UK government payment of ¬£300,000 to Uhde in 1990 after completion of the plant was interrupted by the first Persian Gulf War. The plant was later highlighted by the US government as part of arguing for the legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Britain was said to have exported thiodiglycol (a mustard gas precursor) and thionyl chloride (a nerve gas precursor) to Iraq in 1988 and 1989.

History =Toponym= The toponym \\"Onibury\\" is derived from the Old English for \\"fortified place on the River Onny\\". \\"Onny\\" means \\"river on whose banks ash trees grew\\", from the Welsh \\"on\\" meaning ashes. =Domesday Book= Onibury is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Aneberie. It had 15 households, making it a fairly medium-sized settlement for the time, and a priest. The manor formed part of the Saxon hundred of Culvestan.Open Domesday Onibury =Hundred= Onibury came to be in the lower division of the hundred of Munslow, following the amalgamation of Culvestan and Patton hundreds in the reign of Henry I (1100-1139). Parish church Queen post roof of St. Michael's nave The Church of England parish church of Saint Michael & All Angels has a Norman (or possibly Saxon) chancel arch but much of the present building dates from the 14th century. The nave has a queen post roof, box pews and a west gallery. Lancet windows illuminate the 12th- century chancel, which features a walled-up priest's door. The 16th-century pulpit, late perpendicular with Jacobean additions, has linenfold panelling. St. Michael's has several 17th-century monuments. St. Michael's was restored under the direction of the Arts and Crafts architect Detmar Blow (1867‚Äì1939). The church is a Grade II* listed building. The tower has a ring of four bells. John of Gloucester cast the second and third bells in about 1350. Henry Clibury of Wellington cast the tenor bell in 1676 and John Rudhall of Gloucester cast the treble bell in 1824. For technical reasons the bells are currently unringable. In the churchyard is the parish's war memorial, initially erected after World War I, to the dead of both World Wars in the form of a stone cross. St. Michael's is one of 17 churches in the Benefice of the Ludlow Team Ministry. John Derby Allcroft was Lord of the Manor and Patron of Saint Michael & All Angels church during the 19th century.

He commanded the squadron that surrendered without a fight to the Royal Navy at the Vlieter incident in 1799.  Early life  Story was born in Maasbommel. He entered the navy of the Dutch Republic (Admiralty of the Maze) in 1770. On 5 July 1774 he became a lieutenant on the 20-gun Orangezaal. His first command (in 1781) was the 36-gun frigate Jason. In 1793, he was appointed captain of the 40-gun frigate Pollux at Hellevoetsluis.  Revolution of 1795  In the severe winter of 1794‚Äì1795 the ships of the Dutch Navy at the roadstead of Hellevoetsluis became frozen in the ice on the Meuse river. Story's commanding officer, Rear Admiral Pieter Melvill van Carnbee, appointed him commander of the naval base and squadron. The armies of the French Republic had invaded the Netherlands in the course of the War of the First Coalition They made easy progress. Commander-in-chief of the Dutch Navy, Lieutenant Admiral Jan Hendrik van Kinsbergen ordered Story to offer no resistance. On 3 January, he released and armed 600 French prisoners of war who had been incarcerated on his base. That way he secured the base for the Batavian Republic, proclaimed shortly afterwards. In February 1795, the new government appointed Story to a commission charged with making an inventory of ships and naval installations accused of neglect by the previous government. The commission presented its report on 27 May, and concluded that the state of the Navy was deplorable. This was the basis for an ambitious programme of naval construction in 1796.  Battle of Camperdown  The new fleet was first put to the test in the Battle of Camperdown of 1797. During this battle, Story commanded the Batavian frigate division as rear-admiral aboard the 74-gun ship-of-the-line . This ship caught fire, and while this was extinguished, it drifted to leeward, which made it impossible to rejoin the battle. This may have contributed to the decisive Dutch defeat. In any case, the battle is remarkable because of the new tactics employed by Admiral Adam Duncan, which amounted to breaching the Dutch line, instead of sailing parallel to it (as were the usual tactics up to then). The point where the line was breached was just before Story's ship.  Irish Rebellion  In 1798, the Batavian Republic was asked by its French ally to take part in the expedition to assist the Irish Rebellion of 1798. A Batavian squadron was formed near Texel under the command of Story. When the Dutch part of the expedition to Ireland was cancelled, this squadron was next re-targeted to the East Indies at the request of the Committee of East Indian Commerce of the Batavian government. It was to escort an expeditionary force of 5,000 soldiers under the command of General Herman Willem Daendels who was to be in overall command. Story now attained the temporary rank of vice-admiral. However, strong rumours of a planned Anglo-Russian attack on the Republic in summer 1799 led to the cancellation of this expedition.  Vlieter incident  When the Anglo-Russian expedition materialized in August 1799, Story still commanded the squadron at Texel, again as a rear-admiral. The machinations of a number of officers in his command with Orangist leanings led to the debacle of the Vlieter incident in which Story felt constrained to surrender without a fight to the Royal Navy squadron under Admiral Andrew Mitchell because of a mutiny aboard the Batavian squadron.  Conviction and banishment  After this surrender, Story was made a prisoner of war until 1802, when the Treaty of Amiens was signed. The Batavian government had meanwhile tried him in absentia. He dared not return to the Republic because of this, instead trying to conduct his defence from abroad. He moved to Bremen in October 1802. The Hoge Militaire Vierschaar (\\"High Military Court\\") convicted him on 16 January 1804, of dereliction of duty, cowardice, and disloyalty. He was declared to be \\"perjurious, without honor, and infamous,\\" cashiered from the navy, and sentenced to banishment for life, on penalty of beheading. After this harsh sentence, he spent the rest of his life trying to be rehabilitated. In 1805, he published a defence in the form of a book that was part auto- biography.Story, passim He did not succeed, mainly because he died before the restoration of the leader of the Orangist faction, William I of the Netherlands to power. Other \\"mutineers\\", like Theodorus Frederik van Capellen were rehabilitated by the new king, but this was not extended to Story because he could not ask for rehabilitation. Story died \\"of the impact of dropsy\\" in exile in Cleves on 8 January 1811.

A native of the diocese of Dublin, Ireland, Norreys made a successful career for himself in the church and Oxford university. He was vicar of Dundalk from 1427, and Doctor of Theology at Oxford by 1435. He was later successively canon, prebendary and Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, occupying the latter post by 1457. He also held the post of rector of Trim. His controversies covered matters that had previously concerned his fellow Irishmen, Richard FitzRalph, Henry Crumpe and Dr. John Whitehead. In 1431 he was attacked by the mendicant friars for having Oxford university issuing him letters protecting him from slander. In 1437 he appeared before the papal judge-delegate and the Bishop of Bath & Wells because of attacks he made against the friars during his university lectures. When Norreys was supported by Oxford, the friars appealed to Rome and after a term of imprisonment by Henry VI, Norreys was declared guilty of heresy by a papal court in 1443. He successfully appealed to the Council of Basel, by whom his sentence of excommunication was revoked. Pope Calixtus III then ordered the friars to leave him alone. Norreys wrote sermons, a tract called 'Declamationes', a book of scriptural commentary and the Contra mendicitatem validam. Sources * A New History of Ireland, volume one.

Revere Quality House - Elevations Paul Rudolph, Architect. Revere Quality House - Floor Plan Paul Rudolph, Architect. 240px The Revere Quality House is a house located in Siesta Key, Florida that was designed by architects Paul Rudolph and Ralph Twitchell. It is a breakthrough in twentieth-century residential architecture which blends elements of the International Style with site-sensitive design that is considered one of the notable examples of the Sarasota School of Architecture. The house represents a substantial advancement in how people should live within their environment, and established a new paradigm in tropical home construction. The Revere Quality Institute The Revere Quality Institute was a consortium of the Revere Copper Company, Architectural Forum magazine, and select architects and builders across the country. It was established during the post-war building boom of the late 1940s, with the goal of promoting the development of bold, new, creative, and affordable approaches to residential living. This would be accomplished by building prototype homes in select cities across the country. These designs would promote the use of new, lower-cost, synthetic and re-engineered materials. Paul Rudolph was encouraged by a publisher in New York City to participate, and was offered one of the projects for the firm of Twitchell and Rudolph of Sarasota, Florida. Their project would be the third of eight homes planned for 1948. Developing the concept Roberta Finney was a local patron and friend of Ralph Twitchell. She provided a large flat plot of land on Siesta Key, near a bayou that spilled out onto the Gulf of Mexico. This location would facilitate any number of design approaches. Although both Twitchell and Rudolph were architects, the two had established a unique relationship where Rudolph generally produced conceptual designs, while Twitchell translated them into buildable plans and managed construction. For most of the project, Rudolph worked out of his office in New York City and sent them to Sarasota for review. In 1948, Rudolph traveled to Europe as part of a Harvard architecture fellowship. He was struck by the scale and construction of European urban design. He became particularly interested in the transposition of structures and integration of inner and outer space. This was reflected in his first (and most grand) concept for the Revere project, a large open plan covering the entire lot, with six detached but intertwined homes. It featured a shared public space and parking area, all surrounded by a six foot high wall. This initial idea was dismissed in favor of a traditional single-house suburban plan. A variation of this urban concept was redeveloped into the Lamolithic Houses of Siesta Key, completed by Twitchell and Rudolph later that year. Going back to the drawing board, Rudolph produced a new plan, loosely based on the Mies van der Rohe (Barcelona Pavilion); a scaled-down (1,000 square foot), linear, flat-roof, single-story structure, to be constructed almost entirely of concrete and glass. The low roof (less than eight and a half feet off the ground) would be supported by steel perimeter poles, and extend beyond the frame of the house to create overhangs for shade. At one end, the roof overhang would extend several feet to serve as a carport. The exterior walls were to be made of lamolithic panels, as well as floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors that would open onto large exterior patio areas. Jalousie windows were strategically positioned to promote natural ventilation and cooling. A hole would be cut into the roof to bring light into an incorporated screened-in porch (with grass inside) to further intermingle interior and exterior space. The floor plan was simple and functional, highlighting a single space that conceptually consolidated living, dining, and patio areas. One of the walls would incorporate a large copper- hooded fireplace (provided by Revere Copper and Brass Company). This ‚Äògreat room‚Äô would constitute more than half of the interior capacity of the house. A small galley kitchen was positioned behind a partition wall, along with a narrow hallway that led to two corner bedrooms and shared bath. It was a radical plan at the time, and to create it would require new building applications and methods. Implementing new construction techniques Twitchell had been experimenting with reinforced concrete construction since the late 1930s. His friend and associate, John Lambie, was a local concrete supplier who was developing a method steel-reinforced cast-in-place concrete, called lamolithic construction. For the Revere House roof, Lambie used mobile concrete mixing machines and pumping equipment to pour the material into reusable steel forms set on lally steel poles. Slender steel reinforcement rods were used to hold the elevated slab together. Lambie ingeniously poured the roof with cavities on its upper surface to lighten its weight. He filled the cavities with crushed shell that would collect moisture and create a permeating cooling effect into the home. It represented a milestone in passive environmental engineering. The use of reinforced concrete as a viable substrate proved to be very expensive. Jack West, who was working as a draftsman for Twitchell during the project, acknowledged that the original $14,000 budget for the Revere House doubled to $28,000 by the time the house was completed. The floors were poured terrazzo. Interior wall dividers were fabricated of meticulously-sanded plywood, some of which featured built-in cabinets and drawers (with leather pulls). Wood-framed sliding glass doors were hand-fabricated on site. Ceilings in the great room were painted a bright 'peacock blue', to represent the sky, while the bedroom and kitchen walls were painted 'lemon yellow'. A small service building was built at a ninety-degree angle, protruding from the front of the house, connected by a six-foot high privacy wall. Establishing a new paradigm When the Revere Quality House was opened to visitors, more than 16,000 people toured the building in its first year. It was prominently-featured in Revere‚Äôs advertising campaign nationwide, and received tremendous coverage in the press; Architectural Forum (October 1948), Architectural Review (November 1948), and House and Garden (August 1949). It was advertised regularly in the Saturday Evening Post. The American Institute of Architects recognized the Revere Quality House with its National Honor Award in 1949. Twitchell and Rudolph‚Äôs Revere Quality House created a new paradigm for tropical architecture. Its visceral minimalism and the incorporation of environment into its design represented a new, more integrated, and simpler way of life for middle-class America. Literally millions of homes incorporating aspects of its design have been built across the southern United States. Preservation, addition, and recognition Twitchell and his client would eventually marry and live in the house. He built another significant modern home for Finney‚Äôs parents on the other side of the bayou; the Cocoon House. He lived in the Revere House until his death in 1978. The home fell into disrepair, and was slated for demolition, until 2005, when local conservators restored the original structure. Part of that preservation project included the construction of a new 'companion house' designed by architect Guy Peterson. In 2005, the Revere Quality House was designated as a historic site by the City of Sarasota. In 2008, it was placed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Both the original Revere House and Revere Addition received the American Institute of Architects (Florida) Award of Excellence for Historic Restoration in 2011.

It is an essay discussing the Battle of Cowpens during the American Revolution, which Roberts had originally intended to turn into a novel but published as an essay to popularize his view of the battle. The American commander at Cowpens was Brigadier General Daniel Morgan, one of the heroes of Roberts' earlier novels Arundel and Rabble in Arms as a key aide to Major General Benedict Arnold. Roberts wanted to challenge the historians that had written about the blunders of both Morgan and British Colonel Banastre Tarleton during the battle, but his physical condition wouldn't permit him to finish another novel.

California, 388 U.S. 263 (1967), was an important decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which was argued February 15‚Äì16, 1967, and decided June 12, 1967. The case involved Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights, the taking of handwriting exemplars, in-court identifications and warrantless searches. History Petitioner was convicted of armed robbery and the murder of a police officer. There were separate guilt and penalty stages of the trial before the same jury, which rendered a guilty verdict and imposed the death penalty. Petitioner alleges constitutional errors in the admission of testimony of some of the witnesses that they had also identified him at a lineup, which occurred 16 days after his indictment and after appointment of counsel, who was not notified, and in in-court identifications of other witnesses present at that lineup; in the admission of handwriting exemplars taken from him after arrest; and in the admission of a co- defendant's out-of-court statements mentioning petitioner's part in the crimes, which statements were held to have been improperly admitted against the co-defendant on the latter's appeal. Additionally, he alleges violation of his Fourth Amendment rights by police seizure of photographs of him from his locked apartment after a warrantless entry, and the admission of testimony identifying him from these photographs. Ruling 1\\\\. The taking of handwriting exemplars did not violate petitioner's constitutional rights. pp. 265‚Äì267. (a) The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination reaches compulsory communications, but a mere handwriting exemplar, in contrast with the content of what is written, is an identifying physical characteristic outside its protection. (b) The taking of the exemplars was not a \\"critical\\" stage of the criminal proceedings entitling petitioner to the assistance of counsel; there is minimal risk that the absence of counsel might derogate from his right to a fair trial. 2\\\\. Petitioner's request for reconsideration of Delli Paoli v. United States, (where the Court held that appropriate instructions to the jury would suffice to prevent prejudice to a defendant from references to him in a co-defendant's statement) in connection with his co-defendant's statements, need not be considered in view of the California Supreme Court's holding rejecting the Delli Paoli rationale but finding that any error to petitioner by the admission of the statements was harmless. 3\\\\. A closer examination of the record than was possible when certiorari was granted reveals that the facts with respect to the search and seizure claim are not sufficiently clear to permit resolution of that question, and certiorari on this issue is vacated as improvidently granted. 4\\\\. The admission of the in- court identifications of petitioner without first determining that they were not tainted by the illegal lineup procedure but were of independent origin was constitutional error. (a) Since the record does not permit an informed judgment whether the in-court identifications at the two stages of the trial had an independent source, petitioner is entitled only to a vacation of his conviction, pending proceedings in California courts allowing the State to establish that the in-court identifications had an independent source or that their introduction in evidence was harmless error. (b) With respect to testimony of witnesses that they identified petitioner at the lineup, which is a direct result of an illegal procedure, the State is not entitled to show that such testimony had an independent source but the California courts must, unless \\"able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\\", grant petitioner a new trial if such testimony was at the guilt stage, or grant appropriate relief if it was at the penalty stage.altlaw website References Further reading * External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Warren Court Category:United States Fourth Amendment case law Category:United States Fifth Amendment self-incrimination case law Category:1967 in United States case law Category:1967 in California Category:Legal history of California ","title":"Gilbert v.

Plot The protagonist Chris is abruptly whisked away to a parallel world called Byston Well while his physical body remains in his home world. Chris' spiritual manifestation travels to a new world, where he is thrust into a rebellion. Chris is told that he has a mystical power called \\"Garzey's wing\\", which causes large wings made of light to come out of his ankles, allowing him to fly and run quickly. Chris is told to fight against slave owners and the King's army as the slaves of the Metomeus tribe make their escape from the palace at Izumido. The Ashigaba army fights back with horses, bows, and dinosaur-like creatures called War Beasts. The series centers around the slave's escape, the conflict between the King's army and the slaves, as well as Chris' struggle to make sense of his convoluted situation. Chris exists simultaneously in Byston Well and the real world, and the two can communicate to each other through a necklace they both wear. Real-world Chris feels the bruises and pain Byston Well Chris experiences while fighting soldiers, and training he does in the real world allow him to learn it in Byston Well. While one Chris is in Byston Well surrounded by 12th and 13th century foreigners and being chased by a real army, earth Chris must do Chi exercises to strengthen his mind. In the end, Chris fights off the army and saves Byston Well, but his spirit remains there. Meanwhile, in the real world Chris has gained the power of Garzey's wing himself. Characters Christopher \\"Chris Chiaki :Chris is the main character in the film. The story in based around him and his adventures in Byston Well. He is depicted as a regular half Japanese, half American boy who is trying to get into college but has already failed the college entrance exams twice now. He can turn into Garzey's Wing when he or someone that he cares about is in grave danger. Rumiko Nakato :A close personal friend of Chris who helps him get through the rough times as he is fighting in Byston Well. King Fungun :The ruthless king, who lives in a palace in the city of Izumido, which was built on the backs of the countless slaves he has. Aware of the great powers of the Baraju Tree, King Fungun lets the slaves escape in hopes that they will lead him to the tree, where he then will be able to take it over from the Metomeus by force. Philocres :King Fungun's loyal advisor. Often dispenses useful but somewhat cynical information. Zagazoa :General of the War beast army corp. Came back to assist the King after he caught wind of the attack while fighting the savage Western tribe. Gelgog Aji :General of the Ashigaba who dies when a limestone cave collapses. He had a scruffy beard and shoulder length brown hair. Leelince :A female warrior among the slaves. She takes a position of semi-leadership in the escape. She is able make contact with a hooded figure who is a valuable fighter for the cause. She also exemplifies an attitude of jealously towards the relationship between Chris and Hassan-san. She is able to overcome her jealousy through a single shot of her shown in inversed colours in episode 3. Hassan :The priestess who is able to summon Chris to Bryston Well, using the eight Earthenware bells made from special blue clay. It is questioned how such a devious mind can hide in such innocent beauty. A more serious indictment comes from the general of the war beasts when he accuses Hassan-san of being a fake maiden. Whether or not these claims have any backing has the potential to tarnish an otherwise wholesome reputation. Aishe and Tance :Aishe (pink hair), and Tance (green hair), are Hassan's children. They assist her with spiritual activities. Ketta Keras :Supreme Commander of the Metomeus. Chifchi :A Metomeus lieutenant. Domon :A Metomeus lieutenant. Leader of the suicide squad. Giant Tawrad :Leelince finds Giant Tawrad and he is able to come to the rescue of the Metomeus when all hope seems lost. He comes and goes in the later part of the series, fighting the war beasts because, like many other people, he is morally dissatisfied by the dictatorship in Byston Well. It is pointed out that he has distinctive facial features which are often associated with the Garode tribe in the North. Ondel :Food gatherer leader for the Metomeus. Kurino :Hassan's assistant. Covers the bells so they can bake, and provides firewood. Sechuku :Hassan's guard. Lord Tawazzan :He helps with Chris's inventions and has a bowl cut. Chris' other friends :Chris' other friends show a true, genuine sense of friendship towards Chris. It is evident when they believe Chris and don't even question the possibility that Chris might be going crazy when he starts to feel sick and begins communicating with the Chris in Byston Well. One who is specifically named is Ms. Tarsier Falan Fa :The only Ferario depicted throughout the story, who guides Chris as he adapts to his new world. She is introduced when she gets tangled up in Chris's necklace as he is moving between the real world and Byston Well. She also provide sound advice to Chris and the others when faced with perilous situations. Daragau :These are the most feared of the War Beasts, because of the size, and vicious nature. They are about 30‚Äì35 feet tall, mainly brown and Grey, with a large orange spike on their head to use in battle. Dragorol :Reptilian creatures found in the Boundless Plains of Gabujuju.

Thomas Hibernicus's claim to fame is not as an original author, but as an anthologist and indexer. Life Thomas was a Fellow of the College of Sorbonne and a Master of Arts by 1295, and referred to as a former fellow in the first manuscripts of his Manipulus in 1306. He is believed to have died before 1338. Works =Manipulus florum= Thomas was the author of three short works on theology and biblical exegesis, and the compiler of the Manipulus florum ('A Handful of Flowers'). The latter, a Latin florilegium, has been described as a \\"collection of some 6,000 extracts from patristic and a few classical authors\\".Richard Rouse and Mary Rouse, \\"Preachers, florilegia and sermons: Studies on the Manipulus Florum of Thomas of Ireland\\", Toronto, 1979. Thomas compiled this collection from books in the library of the Sorbonne, \\"and at his death he bequeathed his books and sixteen pounds Parisian to the college\\".A New History of Ireland, volume one, p. 958. On Thomas' reception of Sorbonne manuscripts for excerpts from Peter of Blois, see Chris L. Nighman, \\"Editorial agency in the Manipulus florum: Thomas of Ireland‚Äôs reception of two works by Peter of Blois,\\" in From Learning to Love: Schools, Law, and Pastoral Care in the Middle Ages ‚Äì Essays in Honour of Joseph W. Goering, T. Sharp et al. (eds.), Papers in Mediaeval Studies 29, Toronto: PIMS Publications (2017), 224-48. The Manipulus florum survives in over one hundred ninety manuscripts, and was first printed in 1483. It was printed twenty-six times in the 16th century, eleven times in the 17th. As late as the 19th century editions were published in Vienna and Turin. Although Thomas was apparently a member of the secular clergy, his anthology was highly successful because it was \\"well suited to the needs of the new mendicant preaching orders ... [to] ... locate quotations ... relevant to any subject they might wish to touch on in their sermons.\\"Rouses, Preachers Indeed, Boyer has demonstrated that very soon after the Manipulus was completed a French Dominican used it to compose a series of surviving sermons.Christine Boyer, \\"Un t√©moin pr√©coce de la r√©ception du Manipulus florum au d√©but du XIV√®me si√®cle: le recueil de sermons du dominicain Guillaume de Sauqueville,\\" Biblioth√®que de l'√âcole de Chartes, 163.1 (2006), pp. 43-70. However, Nighman has argued that, although it was surely used by preachers, Thomas did not actually intend his anthology as a reference tool for sermon composition, as argued by the Rouses, but rather as a learning aid for university students, especially those intending on a clerical career involving pastoral care.Chris L. Nighman, \\"Commonplaces on preaching among commonplaces for preaching? The topic Predicatio in Thomas of Ireland's Manipulus florum\\", Medieval Sermon Studies 49 (2005), 37-57.

Nighman, \\"The Manipulus florum, Johannes Nider's Formicarius, and late medieval misogyny in the construction of witches prior to the Malleus maleficarum,\\" Journal of Medieval Latin 24 (2014), 171-84. Thomas was also among the earliest pioneers of medieval information technology that included alphabetical subject indices and cross-references. \\"In his selection, and in the various indexing techniques he invented or improved on, he revealed true originality and inventiveness.\\" Those finding tools are preserved, and electronically enhanced, in Nighman's online critical edition of the Manipulus florum. =Other works= Thomas was also the author of three other works: # De tribus punctis religionis Christiane ('On the three main points of the Christian religion'), on the duties of secular clergy; # De tribus hierarchiis ('On the three hierarchies'), which develops ideas about hierarchy expressed at the end of De tribus punctis; and # De tribus sensibus sacre scripture ('On the three senses of holy scripture'), on the four senses of Scripture. The last two works survive in three and eight manuscripts respectively.A recent study on these three minor works is Declan Lawell, \\"Thomas of Ireland, the Pseudo-Dionysius and the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy: A Study of the Three Opuscula\\", chp. 5, p. 74-87, in J.

Charles Terrot and Wilhelm St√ºcklen had founded a machinery factory in Cannstatt, Germany in 1862, and Terrot added a branch factory in Dijon in 1887, and in 1890 the Dijon factory added bicycles to its products. In 1902, the Dijon factory made its first motorcycle. It was powered by a 2 bhp engine supplied by Z√©del of Switzerland. After that, Terrot built motorcycles with engines from 173cc to 498cc from proprietary engine suppliers including the Swiss manufacturers MAG and Dufeaux, the English makers Chater- Lea and JAP along with Givaudan engines from Lyon, France. Terrot produced its first twin-cylinder model in 1905. From 1915 onwards, it supplied 500cc machines to the French Army. In 1921, Terrot launched new two-stroke models: the 175cc model L and the 267cc model E. In 1925, the latter model was developed into the 250cc model F. From 1923 onwards, Terrot also produced four-stroke models. First with a 350cc JAP engine. From 1927 onwards, also with a 500cc engine. In 1926 Terrot began to make its own four-stroke engines. In 1929, the company produced its 100,000th motorcycle. After the Great Depression a new class of vehicles, motorized bicycles, was introduced. In 1932, Terrot entered motorcycle racing and won a triple championship, winning the French 250cc, 350cc and 500cc classes. In the Second World War Terrot supplied the French Army with sidecars: the model GT from 350cc to 750cc and the model DT from 500cc to 750cc. In 1951, Terrot produced its first motor scooter, called VMS. In the 1950s, the company focused on the market for mopeds and lightweight motorcycles. In 1958, Peugeot took over the company. In 1961, production ended at the former Terrot factory.

The informal nature of an advisory board gives greater flexibility in structure and management compared to the board of directors. Unlike the board of directors, the advisory board does not have authority to vote on corporate matters or bear legal fiduciary responsibilities. Many new or small businesses choose to have advisory boards in order to benefit from the knowledge of others, without the expense or formality of the board of directors. Function The function of an advisory board is to offer assistance to enterprises with anything from marketing to managing human resources to influencing the direction of regulators. Advisory boards are composed of accomplished experts offering innovative advice and dynamic perspectives.Stautberg S, Green N. Innovation from the Outside-In: How A Design Advisory Board Drives Innovation at P&G; [Internet]. 1st ed. 2014 [cited 22 October 2014]. Available from: Meeting quarterly or biannually, boards can provide strategic direction, guide quality improvement, and assess program effectiveness.Taylor, E., Marino, D. Rasor- Greenhalgh, S & Hudak, S. (2010). Navigating practice and academic change in collaborative partnership with a community advisory board. Journal of Allied Health, 39(3), 103-110. Entrepreneurs, especially from startup companies or small business may not want to dilute their control of their business by establishing a board of directors with formal responsibilities and authorities. Thus, an advisory board may be a more suitable solution to entrepreneurs who want access to high-quality advice and network in the industry. Advisory board, as an external group, could also provide non-biased information and advice to entrepreneurs. Advisory boards can be implemented in various different areas, including science, medicine, technology, editorial policy, citizen participation, and other topics. =Roles and responsibilities of advisory board members= *developing an understanding of the business, market and industry trends *provide ‚Äúwise counsel‚Äù on issues raised by owners/directors or management *provide unbiased insights and ideas from a third point-of-view (not involved in the operation of the business) *encourage and support the exploration of new business ideas *act as a resource for executives *provide social networking platform for directors and the company *encourage the development of a governance framework that enable sustainable growth of the company *monitor business performance *impose challenges to directors and management that could improve the business Source: SME Business Owners/Directors The benefits of an advisory board ‚Äì mentoring for growth [Internet]. 1st ed.

Advisory board members should provide the company with knowledge, understanding and strategic thinking of the industry or management of the company. Companies should seek advisory board members whose qualities complement the existing board of directors and not mask gaps in knowledge or skill in the main board. An advisory board strengthens the existing board, but does not interfere with authorities of the existing board. The former editor of The Economist, also an advisory board member, once said, ‚ÄúThey (advisory boards) are there to give focus to or sometimes challenge research and intelligence work being done in the company, thus avoiding groupthink and giving direction on big picture issues.‚Äù.Bottomley V, Bingham K, Thorning-Lund S, Slattery R. The Role of Advisory Boards - Who, what, why and how? [Internet]. 1st ed. Odgers Berndtson; 2014 [cited 25 October 2014]. Available from: http://www.odgersberndtson.co.uk/fileadmin/uploads/united- kingdom/Documents/K_I/The_Role_of_Advisory_Boards_- _Who__What__Why_and_How..pdf Creating and operating an advisory board There are two key questions to be asked when creating and operating an advisory board. The first question is who is trying to achieve what from an advisory board. The second question is how the business of the board should be conducted. The following issues need to be addressed. =Mandate= The type of advisory board members should be determined by the nature of what is sought and expected from them by the enterprise. Advisory board members should have distinctive knowledge on different aspects of business such as marketing, product development, sales techniques that are of use to the directors. A lack of definition in ‚Äúwhat is sought from the advisory board‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat sort of advice is to be sought of‚Äù would lead to a disorganized board, which eventually could lead to an advisory board that provide less value per dollar or hour invested than a well-mandated one. Eventually, it could result in a waste of resources and time for the enterprise and the advisory board members. =Focus= The advisory board must determine what the focus of the committee is, whether it is a broad focus or a narrow one on a specific product feature. Individuals in an advisory board should share a common goal or similar interests. =Size= Size of an advisory board influences the efficiency of delivering ongoing information and effectiveness of organizing board meetings. A large advisory board may result in managerial issues. Therefore, it is recommended that an advisory board begin with the advisory board leader, and grow from a fairly small size to its ultimate number. Group dynamics suggests the maximum size for an advisory board is eight members, which takes into account of the need for enterprise people and other facilitators at meetings. Some advisory board's mandate may require more significant representation of a specific and large number of constituencies. =Meeting organization and frequency= The functioning of an advisory board is affected significantly by how effectively the group's activities are organized and directed. A fixed meeting should be held regularly (monthly, annually or other) and advisory board members must be well informed of the purpose and background information of the meeting in order for them to provide valuable advice. A corollary should be provided to advisory board members, which should be of an appropriate length, organized, comprehensible and informative. While it should be concise, it should provide enough details to provide advisory board members a suitable foundation for them to advise on the business. Confidentiality of the information discussed in the meeting shall be considered. A skilled facilitator, administrator or corporate secretary is required to organize schedules of advisory board meetings and meeting materials. The facilitator or chair of the board should be committed and aware of time management for the meeting. An agenda could improve the organization and time management for the meeting. =Term of membership= Advisory board members could be appointed to specific terms i.e. one, two or three years so that it ensures them to actively commit to the company and prevent them to get too comfortable with their positions. Term of membership is also important when it comes to expansion of the board; term of membership ensures that the size of the advisory board remains efficient and manageable. =Compensation= Advisory board members serve an enterprise for a range of reasons, from personal loyalty to direct compensation. Benefits and drawbacks =Benefits of an advisory board= The benefits of having an advisory board over board of directors may include the following: *Distance control Multinational companies have local companies running their business in a particular foreign jurisdiction for lower costs e.g. tax, price of raw materials, and organizational benefits. However, giving authority to an outside group of directors in the local company may increase risks and instability of the multinational corporation. Since an advisory board can operate in a different location, with different cultural and business norms, in a different language, multinational companies may choose to have an advisory board instead of a localized board of directors in order to avoid loss of control. *Accountability An advisory board helps provide accountability to keep you on track with your overall business goals. Knowing that you will be expected to report on your progress at the next meeting creates the positive peer pressure needed to achieve more. *Preparation for board of directors Companies may choose to have an advisory board before they have a board of directors. The development of an effective board of directors requires a group of individuals with good chemistry and has the combination of appropriate skills to propel the business. Having an advisory board allows companies to assess the commitments and capabilities of each individual and observe the chemistry between them before appointing them to a board of directors. *Higher efficiency A large board of directors may grow to an unmanageable size where organizational complexity and communication breakdown may occur, leading to ineffective and inefficient function of the board. A smaller advisory board, without the complexity of authority involved in board of directors, may work more effectively compared to a board of directors that grows in size as the corporation grows. *Formal advice The complexity and speed of enterprises often make it difficult to seek advice on any particular topic. Enterprises may also find building trust in any person or group to provide on-going and meaningful guidance difficult. An advisory board can then provide the degree of consistency, longevity and background knowledge as advisory board members provide reliable advice on particular issues. Advisory board members receive compensation for committing to their positions. This gives incentives to advisory board members to provide quality advice and ensure that a request for assistance is taken formally. *Less pressure on executives Executives can express partially defined or tentative view to an advisory board since advisory board's sole purpose is to provide advice. This allows them to ‚Äútest- drive options‚Äù before they face the board of directors which demands definitive and assertive business decisions. The board of directors assesses the CEO and establishes his or her compensation. While an advisory board may induce change in the company for the benefits of the company, a board of directors inducing change in the company could suggest a lack of confidence in the senior management team. This imposes great pressure on senior executives and could become a barrier for senior executives to express their issues and seek advice from the board. Thus, an advisory board could be a ‚Äòsafe harbor‚Äô for senior executives to seek advice and test business options. *Directoral Input Directors and Assistant Directors are still required to bring any changes to policy or financial matters to the board for direction. No directors or assistant directors are to make any changes without board approval. *Focused input An enterprise may need advice on a particular aspect of its business (such as marketing, product direction, customer service or contact network expansion). While board of directors need to take into account of all aspects and go through a series of administrative proceedings e.g. formal approvals, ratification, an advisory board can focus directly on a particular issue and give advice. =Drawbacks of an advisory board= The drawbacks of having an advisory board instead of a board of directors may include the following: *Less compensation An advisory board deals with a more narrow range of issues and meet less often than board of directors. There is less commitment for advisory board members compared to directors in the board. This is reflected in the lower compensation advisory board members receive as compared to those in the board of directors. Nevertheless, the compensation for advisory board members depends on various factors, including return of investments, time, organization and cost. *Fiduciary duty/ liability issues Board of directors is exposed to a variety of legislated liabilities, fiduciary and other duties. Responsibilities include unpaid wages, unpaid taxes, environmental damage, etc. By subjecting directors to such liabilities and fiduciary, directors are forced to make decisions and establish policies in a way that minimizes risks. Whereas, an advisory board is not subjected to fiduciary duties or liabilities and therefore could influence the enterprise by providing risky advice.

C. Groom, and mother of romance novelist Patricia Robins. Some other members of her family are well-known artists. Biography =Personal life= Robins was born Denise Naomi Klein on 1 February 1897 in London, England, the daughter of Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell, who was also a prolific author who wrote under several names, and of her first husband, Herman Klein, who was a professor of music and journalist. Of Russian Jewish ancestry, he had been born in Norwich in 1856. Her mother Kathleen Clarice had been born in Melbourne, Australia, on 11 March 1872 and was the daughter of George Cornwell and his wife Jemima Ridpath, married in 1850.Marriage cert GRO Sep 1850 W. Ham 12/415. George Cornwell was a railway guard who became a successful gold prospector in Australia, operating several mines, and a notable building contractor. His eldest daughter, Alice Cornwell, born 1852, was spectacularly rich by the 1890s, returning to England and buying the Sunday Times newspaper.Kathleen Clarice Cornwell... Klein... Dealtry... Groom online at bearalley.blogspot.com (accessed 4 April 2008)Lorrimer, Claire, You Never Know, autobiography Her parents had married in 1890. He had a daughter Sibyl Klein, from a previous marriage, and they had two sons: Adrian Bernard Klein (1892‚Äì1969) and Daryl Klein (1894), before the birth of Denise Naomi Klein (1897‚Äì1985). The childhood of Denise, Adrian and Daryl Klein was far from settled. Kathleen Klein began an affair with a Worcestershire Regiment officer called Herbert Berkeley Dealtry, who was much younger than her husband, and little than herself, and when Hermann Klein became aware of it he filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in December 1901. Kathleen then married Dealtry. In 1905, the Dealtrys had some serious troubles in connection with the promotion of dog shows, which they had been drawn into by Kathleen's sister Alice Stennard Robinson, a leading member of the Ladies' Kennel Association (founded 1904) and the National Cat Club. Somehow, the money from the first dog show went missing, and the Dealtrys held a second show to pay the prize money owed on the first. After the second show, prize winners sued Dealtry, which led to his being declared bankrupt. The family then lived in America for a few years but, by 1908, Kathleen (or 'Kit') Dealtry was back in London, writing Christian novels.Under the Mistletoe Bough (Carruthers, 1908) and Ill-Gotten Gain (Carruthers, 1909) In 1918 she married for a third time and wrote at least three booksLove In The Darkness (London, Skeffington & Son, 1918), Shadows of Desires (London, 1919), and Detective Sylvia Shale (London, Hurst & Blackett, 1924) as Mrs Sydney Groom. Her eldest brother Adrian Bernard Klein also became a writer, he was an artist and wrote books on photography and cinematography. After serving as an officer in the British Army, he became a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and changed his name to Adrian Cornwell-Clyne.

However, like Agatha Christie, Robins continued to publish most of her books under her first married name. =Writing career= When she left school, Denise Klein went to work as a journalist for the D. C. Thomson Press, then became a freelance writer. She began to follow in her mother's footsteps when her first novel was published in 1924.

Robins had been writing fiction and getting it published for ten years when in 1927 she met Charles Boon, of Mills & Boon, and she entered her first contract with his firm the same year. Under the terms of this, she was to be paid an advance of thirty pounds for three novels, plus ten per cent terms. Her next contract, for a further six books, delivered an advance of twenty-five pounds for each book, while her third contract, for four more books, paid one hundred pounds for each, plus terms of twelve and a half per cent. The colourful dust wrappers of Mills & Boon's books were becoming one of their biggest selling points. As an example, the cover of Robins's Women Who Seek (1928) showed a glamorous flapper checking her make-up.McAleer, Joseph, op. cit, page 45 online at books.google.co.uk (accessed 5 April 2008) Robins became not only Mills & Boon's most prolific writer, but also their best paid. A contract she signed in 1932 paid her ¬£2,400 for eight books, which were those from Shatter the Sky (July 1933) to How Great the Price (June 1935). This was, however, her last work for the firm, as she was then 'poached' by a new publisher, Nicholson & Watson.McAleer, Joseph, op. cit, page 69 online at books.google.co.uk (accessed 5 April 2008) Of this development, Arthur Boon wrote: Robins gave her version of events in her autobiography: The first book Robins wrote for Nicholson was Life and Love (1935), which was launched with a huge publicity campaign. Robins's first photo opportunity was a visit to Liverpool to open a new lending library, and the slogan 'Robins for Romance' was posted on London buses.

Linda Batista, born Florinda Grandino de Oliveira (S√£o Paulo, June 14, 1919, - April 17, 1988) was a Brazilian popular musician. Linda was the sister of Dircinha Batista and studied viol√£o (guitar) from age 12 under Patricio Teixeira. She was hired at Radio Cajuti after substituting for her sister on the Gast√£o Lamounier show in 1932. By 1937 she had been elected Brazil's \\"Queen of Radio\\", which she would retain until 1948. She married and quickly divorced in the late 1930s, and became the frontwoman of the Kolman Orchestra at the Cassino da Urca. Her first recordings were released in 1938. Around this time she also began appearing in films such as Maridinho de Luxo and Banana da Terra. She sang at the Radio Cultura in Sao Paulo and then at the Casino of Porchat Isle for six months. She returned to Rio de Janeiro in 1939 and was hired at the Cassino da Urca, where she remained until the casinos were closed in 1945 by state decree. She signed to Victor Records in 1940, and would record for the label until 1960. She toured throughout Brazil in the early and mid-1940s, scoring many nationwide hits such as \\"Tudo √© Brasil\\" (1941), \\"Batuque No Morro\\" (1941), \\"Clube Dos Barrigudos\\" (1944), \\"No Boteco Do Jos√©\\" (1946), \\"Enlouqueci\\" (1948), \\"Nega Maluca\\" (1950), and \\"Vingan√ßa\\" (1951). She embarked on a tour of Portugal, France, and Italy in 1951. In the 1950s she did extensive work for films. She toured Uruguay in 1957-58 and Argentina in 1959. In 1960, she appeared in Carlos Machado's Varieties show at the nightclub Night and Day. She retired from active performance in 1960. Linda Batista, 1960¬¥s.

No major river flows into Chincoteague Bay‚Äîits largest tributaries are Newport Creek in Worcester County and Swans Gut Creek in Accomack County. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Chincoteague Bay was well known for its shellfish industry, which shipped oysters, crabs, and clams to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. The shellfish industry was based in several landings and small towns: Taylors Landing at Girdletree, Maryland, George Island Landing at Stockton, Maryland, and Franklin City and Greenbackville in Virginia. Girdletree, Stockton, and Franklin City were all on the now-defunct southern end of what is today the Maryland and Delaware Railroad that ran south from Snow Hill, Maryland. Overfishing depleted shellfish stocks, which have still not recovered. Currently, the largest settlements on the Bay are Public Landing, Maryland, Greenbackville, Captain's Cove (a planned residential community near Greenbackville), and the town of Chincoteague. The bay is an important stop on the Atlantic Flyway. The E.A.

Early life Marcel- Auguste Dieulafoy was born in Toulouse into an educated and ennobled family. In 1863, Dieulafoy entered the √âcole Polytechnique where he studied civil engineering. Upon graduating, he joined France's Bureau of roads and bridges, taking up a position in Sour al-Ghozlane (then called Aumale) in Algeria. In 1870, he returned to France, assuming a post in the navigation services on the Garonne. That same year he married Jane Magre (1851-1916), who was also from Toulouse. He was an engineering officer in the French Army during the Franco- Prussian War (1870‚Äì71), posted to Nevers. Upon demobilisation, he became first the head of the supply services for the Department of the Haute Garonne and subsequently, in 1874, of municipal services for his native city of Toulouse. As a result, both of a cultivated family environment and his time spent in Algeria, Dieulafoy had long had an interest in medieval and Roman archaeology. As a result, he became acquainted with Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc, under whose direction he worked for four years in the Commission of Historic Monuments. With Viollet-le-Duc's encouragement, Dieulafoy decided to pursue this interest at a professional level. In 1880, he resigned his post in Toulouse and requested a government assignment in Iran. The Susa excavations Arriving quite ill in Tehran via Athens and Constantinople (Istanbul), he was attended to by a French doctor Fran√ßois Tholozan. Shortly thereafter they embarked upon an expedition to Susa, where Dieulafoy and his wife explored the remains of the palace first uncovered by William Loftus some thirty years previously. During this visit, the Dieulafoys took numerous photographs and made copious notes. His wife, Jane, took on as close to a male appearance as she could during their sojourn in Iran. This brief journey to Susa made a lasting impression on Dieulafoy. Upon his return to France, he started to organise the publication of the first volume of his magnum opus, L'Art antique de la Perse, the first volume of which appeared in 1884. That year he obtained a grant from the newly founded Department of Antiquities at the Louvre and from the Minist√®re de l'Instruction publique as well as logistical support from the French army and navy in order to fund further study. The Dieulafoys returned to Iran in 1884, accompanied by a young engineer, Charles Babin and by the naturalist Fr√©d√©ric Houssay. It was Tholozan, then official physician to the Qajar court, who intervened on Dieulafoy's behalf with the Persian authorities to obtain permission to explore Susa further, with the proviso that the Tomb of Daniel not be disturbed. Further, agreement was reached which allowed any discoveries made at the site, except for those of precious metals, to be split equally between the French and Persian governments. Work took place between the winters of 1885 and 1886. The excavations took place under arduous conditions. The team lived in tents and were exposed to the harshness of the elements. There was little government control in the region, meaning that roving bands of thieves operated quite freely. Nonetheless, Dieulafoy's expedition succeeded in discovering numerous objects, most of which ended up in the Louvre Museum since the Persian government, uninterested in the largely brick and stone mortar fragments that were unearthed, waived its right to share in the discoveries. None of the pieces that were not shipped to France survived. These \\"museum pieces\\", however, were of secondary importance to Dieulafoy, whose primary interest remained the architecture of the site. He succeeded in partially excavating the great central columned hall (the Apadana), originally identified by Loftus as having been originally built by Darius and then restored by Artaxerxes II. Later life After publishing the results of his mission, Dieulafoy lost interest in Iran. He returned to the French civil service, taking a position in the administration of the national rail system and devoted himself to biblical studies. He was elected to the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1895 and started to research the history of French architecture and the early sculpture of Spain and Portugal. At the outbreak of World War One, Dieulafoy wanted to return to military service, despite being 70. He was sent to Rabat as a lieutenant colonel in the Engineering corps, where he supervised the excavation of a local mosque. In 1919, he published his last work on the theme of Daniel and Balthazar. He died the following year after a brief illness. L'Art antique de la Perse Dieulafoy is still remembered for his work, L'Art antique de la Perse, which was published in five volumes, folio between 1884 and 1889. His wife, Jane, took many photographs of local sites, especially at Ctesiphon, Pasargadae, Persepolis and Susa. The fine quality of these images, many of sites that have subsequently been destroyed, damaged, or badly restored, means the work remains an invaluable scholarly resource. Notes References *E. and J.

The caves are located in the Summer Lake basin at elevation and face to the west in a ridge of Miocene and Pliocene era basalts mixed with soft volcanic tuffs and breccias, from which the caves were carved by Pleistocene-era waves from Summer Lake. One of the caves may contain archaeological evidence of the oldest definitively-dated human presence in North America. The site was first studied by Luther Cressman in the 1930s. Scientific excavations and analysis since 2002 have uncovered substantial new discoveries. These include materials with the oldest DNA evidence of human habitation in North America. The DNA, radiocarbon dated to 14,300 years ago, was found in subfossil human coprolites uncovered in the Paisley Five Mile Point Caves in south-central Oregon. The caves were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Recent finds A field school from the University of Oregon has been examining the site since 2002 and analyzing its pre-Clovis artifacts. In the summer of 2007, they identified the oldest human DNA yet discovered in the American continents. This assertion is based on analysis of several samples of coprolite found in the Paisley Caves complex.Gilbert, M. Thomas P., Dennis L. Jenkins, et al.

Macphail Comment on \\"DNA from Pre-Clovis Human Coprolites in Oregon, North America\\", Science 10 July 2009, Vol. 325. no. 5937, p. 148, The coprolites were found in Paisley Five Mile Point Cave at the same level as a small rock-lined hearth some below the modern surface. Also discovered at that level was a large number of bones from waterfowl, fish, and large mammals, including extinct camel and horse. Radiocarbon dating places these coprolites between 12,750 and 14,290 calendar years before the present, probably representing a pre-Clovis occupation. DNA analysis provides apparent genetic ties to Siberia or Asia.\\"Researchers, Led by Archaeologist, Find Pre-Clovis Human DNA\\" Newswise, Retrieved on July 7, 2008. Evidence at other archaeological sites ‚Äî as well as previous work at Paisley Caves in the 1930s ‚Äî had been thought to provide such evidence, but questionable excavation techniques clouded the issue. Knowing this, the University of Oregon team worked carefully to avoid the mistakes of the past. The theory that pre-Clovis immigrants traveled to North America down the Pacific Coast suggests that the travelers would have passed through the hinterlands of what is Oregon today. DNA from coyote, fox, and dog (or wolf) was found as well. Later, hunting tools were found in the caves. Special projectile points known as 'Western Stemmed points' were recovered. These are quite different from the Clovis points. No evidence of diagnostic Clovis technology was found at the site.Jenkins / Willerslev et al. \\"Clovis Age Western Stemmed Projectile Points and Human Coprolites at the Paisley Caves\\", Science, 13 July 2012.

In 2002, a team of researchers from Oregon State University found evidence of human presence on the southern Oregon coast (Indian Sands in the Boardman State park), dating from more than 10,000 years ago ‚Äî more than 2,000 years older than previously known archaeological sites on Oregon's coast.

Hasenohr, editors, Guidebook to Field Trips in Vermont and Adjacent New Hampshire and New York, New England Intercollegiate Geologic Conference, 89th Annual Meeting. pp. A2.1 - A2.19. The pluton is approximately 20 km wide by 90 km long and on average about 2.5 km thick. It is exposed in west-central New Hampshire along a north-northeast by south-southwest axis, extending from the town of Groton in the north to Dublin in the south. Mount Cardigan, from which the pluton is named, stands near the north end. The pluton ranges in composition from granite to tonolite (s-type) and is likely derived from crustal melting of pelitic rocks. The rocks show foliation indicating they were implaced early in the Acadian Orogeny and subsequently overprinted by later metamorphic events. Minerals in the Cardigan Pluton include large K-feldspar megacrysts and quartz, plagioclase, muscovite, garnet, biotite, and less abundant minerals including sillimanite, cordierite, ilmenite, graphite, apatite, monazite, zircon, and allanite.Plank, T.

Although not released as a single, it reached number 36 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. History \\"Bobby Jean\\" was one of the last songs from the album to be recorded, and was considered a musical breakthrough for Springsteen during the recording, with its more accented rhythm and near dance groove.Marsh, Dave. Glory Days: Bruce Springsteen in the 1980s. Pantheon Books, 1987. . p. 168. The title character's name is somewhat gender ambiguous,Rob Kirkpatrick, The Words and Music of Bruce Springsteen, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. p. 101. allowing for various interpretations. Nonetheless, \\"Bobby Jean\\" is often considered to have been written about his long-time friendship with Steve Van Zandt, who was leaving the E Street Band at the time: for example, Swedish journalist Richard Ohlsson made the interpretation in his book Bruce Springsteen: 16 Album that the title contained both a male and a female name because \\"the friendship with Bobby Jean is so strong that it's almost a kind of love.\\" When this song is played live with the E Street Band, close ups of Van Zandt are often shown on the bigscreens. :Now you hung with me, when all the others turned away ... turned up their nose :We liked the same music ‚Äî we liked the same bands ‚Äî we liked the same clothes :We told each other, that we were the wildest, the wildest things we'd ever seen ... The lyric turns to deeper emotions, which Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh characterized as \\"lines that mingle love, grief, and rancor\\", with the chorus summing: :Now I wished you would have told me ‚Äî :I wished I could have talked to you ‚Äî :Just to say goodbye, Bobby Jean ... At the conclusion, Springsteen imagines the song's subject hearing the very song in a motel room, as Roy Bittan's piano riff that drives the song yields to a saxophone coda from Clarence Clemons and the recording fades out. Marsh suggests that Springsteen was not singing a farewell just to Van Zandt, but also to his own depressed Nebraska self. Nevertheless, use of minor to major altered chord in the last parts of the chorus lend the song a spirit of generosity.Rikky Rooksby, Bruce Springsteen: Learn from the Greats and Write Better Songs, Backbeat Books, 2005. p. 61. Live performances The song has become one of Bruce Springsteen's more popular concert staples, with about 596 performances through 2013. During the 1984-85 Born in the U.S.A. Tour, \\"Bobby Jean\\" appeared frequently throughout the shows with a loud audience response, during the 1988 Tunnel of Love Express, the song generally appeared first to last; though by the 1992-93 \\"Other Band\\" Tour, \\"Bobby Jean\\" was not heard during concerts. By the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, the song was suddenly turned into a short four-minute performance with only Springsteen doing his opening on harmonica and acoustic guitar. It remained to have several performances on the Reunion Tour and only several times on The Rising Tour. By the Devils & Dust Tour, the acoustic version had turned given yet another warm welcome back by fans, however, by the start of the Sessions Band Tour, \\"Bobby Jean\\" appeared, still on acoustic guitar and harmonica only this time the large outfit were playing a folk-like tune in the back that made it sound rather depressing. Springsteen and the E Streeters since reverted to playing the original version on the late 2000s Magic Tour and Working on a Dream Tour, being occasionally setlisted, usually being heard in the band's encore. Springsteen performed \\"Bobby Jean\\" with Phish during their closing set at the 2009 Bonnaroo Music Festival. In 2010 a live version of the song appeared on the live DVD London Calling: Live in Hyde Park. The song was used as the primary closer of the shows throughout 2016/2017 tour.

Senator Kennedy put out a press release explaining the rationale behind introducing the SSPA. Hearings were held before the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 13, 2008. On Thursday, April 24, the committee approved the proposed legislation, voting 11-8 to send the bill to the full Senate for consideration. In a March 31, 2008 letter to Senator Leahy, Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey expressed strong Bush Administration opposition to the legislation, saying in his letter that the bill \\"would needlessly and improperly interfere with the appropriate constitutional role of both the Judicial and Executive branches in state secrets cases; would alter decades of settled case law; and would likely result in the harmful disclosure of national security information that would not be disclosed under current doctrine.\\" Numerous scholars and non-governmental organizations (including the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Bar Association, the Constitution Project, and the Brennan Center for Justice) issued responses to the Attorney General's letter refuting his criticisms of the bill. These scholars and organizations noted that current laws surrounding State Secrets allow much room for abuse, and claimed that taking a new approach would not jeopardize security in any manner because each case would be left to the discretion of US courts (who have acted in good faith with regard to national security in the past). The SSPA legislation was initially proposed in the 110th Congress in response to the government‚Äôs assertions of the State Secrets Privilege in cases challenging the constitutionality of several of the Bush administration‚Äôs national security programs, including the warrantless wiretapping, rendition and interrogation programs. Similar legislation was also introduced in the House, , during the 110th Congress. Leading members of the Senate Judiciary Committee of the 111th Congress have joined together to re-introduce the State Secrets Protection Act, , (\\"SSPA\\"), a bill that provides guidance to federal courts considering cases in which the government has asserted the State Secrets Privilege. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ranking Member Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), and Committee Member Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) joined with former Committee Chairman and Member Edward Kennedy (D-Ma.) to introduce the bill on Wednesday, February 11, 2009.

Sokolov wanted to continue his education in Italy, so he stayed in school for one more year and participated in the contest again, but he did not manage to achieve this goal.  Career  Sokolov captured numerous people in his portraits, starting with fellow artists and ending with veterans of the Patriotic War of 1812. Amongst those people individuals such as Alexander Pushkin and Vasily Zhukovsky, who were famous Russian poets, were included as well. Additionally, Sokolov received many commissions from various high-ranking persons. For example, the artist was invited by the imperial family to Anichkov Palace where he painted a portrait of Nicholas I of Russia's three-year-old son, Alexander, and the work was a success with the family. Some of Sokolov's commissioners repeatedly requested works from him. One of the people who were painted three times was Ekaterina Pavlovna Bakunina. She was depicted in the years 1816, 1828 and 1834. In her first portrait which was done in pencil, she is depicted as a youthful lady. In the aquarelle work of 1828, Sokolov managed to convey the features that were socially desirable and attractive at that time in her portrait. As for the 1834 portrait, one can easily see how Sokolov depicted Bakunina (now Poltoratskaya) as a married woman. Over the course of his life he created over 500 artworks, and not only are they found in private collections, since they are extremely valuable, but also in famous government museums such as State Russian Museum, State Tretyakov Gallery, and many others. Technique Sokolov was one of the first to employ a special watercolour technique where emulsion was not utilized,Bibliographical article in Russian \\"–°–û–ö–û–õ–û–í –ü–µ—Ç—Ä –§–µ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á\\" Accessed 1 April 2014.

From 1820 and onwards, he completely involved himself in perfecting his art form in which he succeeded. This technique in the years between 1820 and 1840 managed to replace the portrait miniatures that were popular in Russia prior to that. Even though Sokolov specialized in aquarelle painting, oftentimes he would use a graphite pencil in order to manage his initial draft, as well as an aid for special effects to enhance his artworks.Article in Russian online magazine \\"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∏ –≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–µ –∑–µ—Ä—Ü–∞–ª–æ: –ü–µ—Ç—Ä –§–µ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –°–æ–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤ - –∞–∫–≤–∞—Ä–µ–ª–∏ (1791-1848) - –º–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –∞–∫–≤–∞—Ä–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ—Ä—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç–∞ –ø—É—à–∫–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π —ç–ø–æ—Ö–∏\\" Accessed 1 April 2014.

Other methods are available, but peroxide value is the most widely used. It gives a measure of the extent to which an oil sample has undergone primary oxidation, extent of secondary oxidation may be determined from p-anisidine test.Chemistry And Technology Of Oils And Fats Chemistry And Technology Of Oils And Fats By Dr. M.M. Chakrabarty The double bonds found in fats and oils play a role in autoxidation. Oils with a high degree of unsaturation are most susceptible to autoxidation. The best test for autoxidation (oxidative rancidity) is determination of the peroxide value. Peroxides are intermediates in the autoxidation reaction. Autoxidation is a free radical reaction involving oxygen that leads to deterioration of fats and oils which form off-flavours and off-odours. Peroxide value, concentration of peroxide in an oil or fat, is useful for assessing the extent to which spoilage has advanced.  Definition  The peroxide value is defined as the amount of peroxide oxygen per 1 kilogram of fat or oil. Traditionally this was expressed in units of milliequivalents, although if we are using SI units then the appropriate option would be in millimoles per kilogram (N.B. 1 milliequivalents = 0.5 millimole; because 1 mEq of O2 =1 mmol/2=0.5 mmol of O2, where 2 is valence). The unit of milliequivalent has been commonly abbreviated as mequiv or even as meq. Method The peroxide value is determined by measuring the amount of iodine which is formed by the reaction of peroxides (formed in fat or oil) with iodide ion. 2 I‚àí \\\\+ H2O + HOOH -> HOH + 2OH‚àí \\\\+ I2 The base produced in this reaction is taken up by the excess of acetic acid present. The iodine liberated is titrated with sodium thiosulphate. 2S2O32‚àí \\\\+ I2 -> S4O62‚àí \\\\+ 2 I‚àí The acidic conditions (excess acetic acid) prevents formation of hypoiodite (analogous to hypochlorite), which would interfere with the reaction. The indicator used in this reaction is a starch solution where amylose forms a blue to black solution with iodine and is colourless where iodine is titrated. A precaution that should be observed is to add the starch indicator solution only near the end point (the end point is near when fading of the yellowish iodine colour occurs) because at high iodine concentration starch is decomposed to products whose indicator properties are not entirely reversible. Taste Peroxide values of fresh oils are less than 10 milliequivalents/kg; when the peroxide value is between 30* and 40 milliequivalents/kg, a rancid taste is noticeable.

The tower is capped by two spires that are capped with four flagpoles each. When the spires were taken into account, it was the tallest building in Edmonton from 2011 to 2017. Epcor Tower is the first building in the Station Lands project. Tenants includes EPCOR Utilities, Capital Power, Ernst & Young, Intuit, and BioWare. History Development of the tower started in May 2007 when EPCOR Utilities began seeking proposals from developers to lease of office space for their 1,100 employees in downtown Edmonton. It was announced on December 7, 2007, that the company had chosen Qualico to provide the space with the construction of new office tower on the Station Lands site by the CN Tower. Epcor entered into a 20-year lease to become the anchor tenant of the tower with an option for a 15-year renewal. The structure was certified to a silver standard or higher under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. LEED certification is a widely used standard for reducing energy, water and other resources in buildings. With the completion of the building, Edmonton saw its first new office tower in 17 years. Due to the nature of the anchor tenant, the building has been nicknamed the \\"Power Tower\\". Construction of the tower began in spring 2008 and was completed in 2011. In April 2008, Edmonton City Council approved $45 million in funding to immediately build a 180-metre underground portion of the future Metro LRT line beneath the tower's underground parkade, at the same time as the building's construction. The coordinated construction effort saved the City of Edmonton approximately $140 million. The remaining construction of the Metro Line resumed in 2012, with the line opening in September 2015. Also in April 2008, Qualico announced plans to bid on the right to host a new Canadian national portrait gallery in the new building. However, the federal government scrapped the plan later in the year.

It was of great size for an amphibian, reaching in length with an elongated skull.Temnospondyli Etymology The name means \\"round eared lizard\\" in Ancient Greek, derived from round openings or fenestrae in the cheeks, which are thought to contain structures of the middle ear. History Cyclotosaurus mordax skull German naturalist Eberhard Fraas erected the genus Cyclotosaurus in 1889, with C. robustus (previously Mastodonsaurus robustus) as the type species. Several species are known, mainly from Germany and Poland in Central Europe, as well as East Greenland and Thailand. The relationships between species is unclear. \\"Labyrinthodon\\" pachygnathus Owen, 1842 and \\"L.\\" leptognathus Owen, 1842 were transferred to Cyclotosaurus, as C. pachygnathus and C. leptognathus, by Paton (1974).PATON, R. L. 1974. Capitosauroid labyrinthodonts from the Trias of England. Palaeontology, 17, 253‚Äì289, pls 35‚Äì36. However, Damiani (2001) assigned the two species to Mastodonsauroidea indeterminate and Stereospondyli indeterminate. Palaeontology Cyclotosaurus intermedius model The genus is known from the Ladinian in the Middle Triassic to the Norian in the Late Triassic, and represents the last of the Mastodonsaurids. Life restoration of Cyclotosaurus The oldest, questionable, species is Cyclotosaurus papilio, known from a partial skull recovered from the Ladinian (Middle Triassic) age Upper Muschelkalk beds from Baden-W√ºrttemberg in Germany. Cyclotosaurus robustus is known from the Carnian (Late Triassic) Schilfsandstein Formation in Stuttgart-Feuerbach in Germany, while C. ebrachensis has been described from the Blasensandstein Formation in Ebrach. Cyclotosaurus intermedius has been described from lacustrine deposits dated to the late Carnian in Krasiej√≥w in southern Poland. It is so named as it has features intermediate between the more ancient C. robustus and more recent C. mordax. Importantly, postcranial material of this species has been recovered, which is unusual this genus. Cyclotosaurus hemprichi is known from the Norian (Late Triassic) age Knollenmergel of Halberstadt, and Cyclotosaurus posthumus from the Stubensandstein (Norian) in Pfaffenhofen. A partial skull very similar to C. posthumus has been recovered from the Norian (Late Triassic) Huai Hin Lat Formation near Chulabhorn Dam in Northeastern Thailand. In 2016 a new species, C. buechneri, was described from the Late Triassic (middle Carnian) Stuttgart Formation of Bielefeld, the northernmost record in Germany. In 2017, Cyclotosaurus naraserluki, a new endemic species from the Fleming Fjord Fm., East Greenland, was described as the closest Cyclotosaurus species to C. mordax, also being the westernmost and northernmost known species of Cyclotosaurus.Marzola, M., Mateus O., Shubin N.

The road turns north, ends at an intersection with U.S. Highway 385 (US 385) and N-92 in Bridgeport. The route was designated in 1937, before the official state highway system was created.

The road quickly bends east after less than , and continues in a straight line. For the next , N-88 intersects minor streets, through rural farmland. The route turns south at N-71, and becomes concurrent. later, N-88 turns east, ending the concurrency with N-71. The route continues to travel through farmland for , where it enters Morrill County. The road crosses over Pumpkin Creek four times, and enters the unincorporated community of Redington. Two rock formations, Courthouse and Jail Rocks, become visible from the road. N-88 turns north toward Bridgeport soon after. The road crosses over Pumpkin Creek for the fifth time, and enters into Bridgeport later. The road intersects a railroad owned by BNSF Railway. N-88 turns northeast soon after, and ends at the intersection of US 385 and N-92. In 2012, Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) calculated as many as 2,410 vehicles traveling on the N-71/N-88 concurrency, and as few as 315 vehicles traveling east of the Banner‚ÄìMorrill county line. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. Only the N-71/N-88 concurrency is part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. History Courthouse and Jail rocks near N-88 N-88 was unofficially designated around 1937, connecting from N-29, to N-86 and N-19 in Bridgeport. The route remained relatively the same as the state highway system was officially designated. Before 1955, Nebraska did not have an adequate legal instrument to define the state highway system. By 1960, N-19 was renumbered to US 385, and US 26 was rerouted north near Bridgeport. The old alignment became part of N-92. Two years later, N-29 was renumbered to N-71. Between 1981-82, a road appeared on the official state map, extending from WYO 151 to N-71. That road became part of N-88 by 1986. No significant changes have been made since.

Unlike more advanced temnospondyls of the time, such as Eryops, Edops exhibited an archaic pattern of palatal bones, and still possessed various additional bones at the back of the skull. Edopoids also had particularly big premaxillae (the bones that form the tip of the snout) and proportionally small external nostrils. Within the clade, the most basal member seems to be Edops from the Early Permian Archer City Formation of the US, a broad-skulled animal with large palatal teeth. Edops was fairly big, at in length.

Owned by the Union Pacific Railroad, it is currently leased by the Portland and Western Railroad. History The bridge was built in 1910 by the Southern Pacific Company, in response to the desires of Portland city planners for an eastside railway bypass to keep rail traffic out of downtown Portland. With its acquisition of Southern Pacific in 1996, Union Pacific Railroad assumed ownership of the bridge. Currently, the bridge is operated by the Portland and Western Railroad under a lease from Union Pacific. Description The entire bridge is in length. On the west (Lake Oswego) side, there is a deck plate girder approach span that was built in 1900 and moved to this location in 1931. In 1934, a open-deck trestle was built on this side of the river. Holding the railway deck across the river are two through truss spans. Completing the bridge on the east side in Oak Grove is a open-deck trestle.

It is distinguished from other temnospondyls by its short and very wide skull and the elongated neural spines that form a ridge along its back. Sclerothorax is a basal member of Capitosauria, a large clade of temnospondyls that lived throughout the Triassic. Description Restoration Among the most unusual features of Sclerothorax are its elongated neural spines. The neural spines are tallest at the front of the spine. Sclerothorax also has a very large pectoral girdle; the interclavicle bone is longer than the skull, meaning that Sclerothorax has the proportionally largest interclavicle of any temnospondyl. The body of Sclerothorax is covered by small scale-like bony ossicles that would have been embedded in the dermis in life. The skull of Sclerothorax is short, wide, and roughly rectangular in shape. The snout is wider than the cheek region. The bones along the midline of the skull roof are also very wide relative to those of other temnospondyls. Discovery Two fossil specimens of Sclerothorax were discovered in the German state of Hesse in the 1920s. German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene studied the remains and named the new genus and species Sclerothorax hypselonotus in 1932. The holotype specimen preserved only the vertebral column, but was identifiable as a temnospondyl by its rhachitomous vertebrae and as a new species by its tall neural spines. Huene's second specimen included a complete skull, pectoral girdle, and back portion of the dorsal vertebral column that was also clearly a temnospondyl. However, it was not apparent that the specimen belonged to the same species as the first until Huene exposed more of the crushed vertebrae and found that they were similar to those of his first specimen. A third specimen of Sclerothorax was discovered in 1967 that preserved the vertebral column and the lower jaw. It was described in 2004 by Michael Fastnacht, who also reported that the specimen had an impression of the palate. The palate seemed to be long and narrow like that of another German temnospondyl called Trematosaurus. Fastnacht therefore concluded that Huene's two specimens belonged to different species, with the first high-spined specimen referable to Sclerothorax. However, three more specimens were uncovered in German museum collections with nearly complete skulls attached to vertebral columns. These specimens had broad heads, proving that Huene's second specimen also belongs to Sclerothorax. Classification Restoration Huene originally classified Sclerothorax within the family Actinodontidae as a close relative of Sclerocephalus, another genus of temnospondyl from Germany that has a similarly broad skull. This classification put it as a close relative of a major temnospondyl group called Stereospondyli, characterized by centra (central portions of vertebrae) that are primarily formed by bones called intercentra (non-stereospondyl temnospondyls have an additional bone called the pleurocentrum that forms a significant portion of each vertebra). The unusual vertebrae of Sclerothorax were thought to separate it from stereospondyls, but in 2000 it was reinterpreted as a tentative member of the group. A phylogenetic analysis published in 2007 placed Sclerothorax as a derived stereospondyl in a clade called Capitosauria.

It is designated Opus 27, Number 4. The text of this Lied, the German love poem \\"Morgen!\\", was written by Strauss's contemporary, John Henry Mackay, who was of partly Scottish descent but brought up in Germany. History Strauss had met Mackay in Berlin, and set Morgen! to music on 21 May 1894. It was one of his four Lieder Opus 27, a wedding present to his wife Pauline. Initially, he set the accompaniment for piano alone, and for piano with violin. In 1897 he arranged the piece for orchestra with violin solo. \\"Morgen!\\" remains one of Strauss's best-known and most widely recorded works. Strauss himself recorded it in 1919 accompanying the tenor Robert Hutt on the piano, and again in 1941 conducting the orchestral version with tenor Julius Patzak and the Bavarian State Orchestra. His last recording of it was 11 June 1947, a live broadcast on radio with Strauss conducting the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana and soprano Annette Brun.CD Richard Strauss: Duett Concertino and Der B√ºrger als Edelmann, Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana, CPO 7779902 (bonus track 14). Instrumentation of accompaniment Strauss wrote the song originally to be accompanied by piano. In 1897 he orchestrated the accompaniment for orchestral strings plus a solo violin, a harp, and three horns. The orchestral strings are muted, and the dynamic throughout is pianissimo or softer. The harp, playing arpeggios, and the solo violin accompany continuously until the word \\"stumm\\", at which point the horns enter. The violin and harp reenter after \\"Schweigen', and the horns fall silent until the last few bars. The last chord is joined by a solo horn.Richard Strauss Lieder, Complete Edition Vol. IV, London, 1965, Boosey & Hawkes A performance lasts about 3 1/2 minutes. Text The poem, with minor changes by Strauss, reads as follows: > Morgen! Und morgen wird die Sonne wieder scheinen und auf dem Wege, den ich > gehen werde, wird uns, die Gl√ºcklichenIn line 3 Strauss replaced Mackay's > \\"Seligen\\" with \\"Gl√ºcklichen\\" sie wieder einen inmitten dieser sonnenatmenden > Erde... und zu dem Strand, dem weiten, wogenblauen, werden wir still und > langsam niedersteigen, stumm werden wir uns in die Augen schauen, und auf > uns sinkt des Gl√ºckes stummesIn the last line Strauss replaced Mackay's > \\"gro√ües\\" with \\"stummes\\" Schweigen... Literal translation: > Tomorrow! And tomorrow the sun will shine again and on the way that I will > go, she will again unite us, the happy ones amidst this sun-breathing earth, > and to the beach, wide, wave-blue will we still and slowly descend silently > we will look in each other's eyes and upon us will sink the mute silence of > happiness Poetic English translation: > Tomorrow! Tomorrow again will shine the sun And on my sunlit path of earth > Unite us again, as it has done, And give our bliss another birth... The > spacious beach under wave-blue skies We'll reach by descending soft and > slow, And mutely gaze in each other's eyes, As over us rapture's great hush > will flow. English edition by John Bernhoff, 1925 Universal-Edition: > Tomorrow! Tomorrow's sun will rise in glory beaming, And in the pathway that > my foot shall wander, We'll meet, forget the earth, and lost in dreaming, > Let heav'n unite a love that earth no more shall sunder... And towards that > shore, its billows softly flowing, Our hands entwined, our footsteps slowly > wending, Gaze in each other's eyes in love's soft splendour glowing, Mute > with tears of joy and bliss ne'er ending...

He is best known for his design of the Nutrition facts label, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated food labeling system that appears on all packaged foods in the United States, which has been called by some \\"the most frequently reproduced graphic in the world.\\" He is also widely known for the pioneering work in legal advertising that earned him a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Legal Marketing Association as well as induction into that organization's Hall of Fame. Biography He was born July 8, 1947 in Columbia, South Carolina. The Belser family has been long-established in the South, with Christian Belser (1752‚Äì1812) arriving in Charleston from Baden-Baden, Duchy of W√ºrttemberg in 1787. A family plantation, Sunnyside on Edisto, South Carolina, has been exclusively in family hands from the Mikell side of the family for over 300 years. Summer-long stays in the natural setting of the plantation awakened his artistic predilection. He took painting and drawing courses at the University of South Carolina when he was eight. He redrew entire issues of The New Yorker cartoons before settling on favorite cartoonists such as William Steig and Charles Barsotti. His parents divorced in 1953. Belser lived another two years in Columbia with his mother and sister before moving with them and his stepfather to Birmingham, Alabama, for a year, then on to Memphis, Tennessee, for his junior high and high school years. Belser was given the President's Award by the student body, an award given to the individual judged to have contributed most to the high school. He is an Eagle Scout and earned the God and Country award. Belser was not trained in graphic design. He was an English major and an art minor at Davidson College in North Carolina (the school offered no graphic design courses). During the decade following college, Belser trained himself to be a designer. In 1992, he was contacted by David Aaron Kessler's staff at the FDA to help with the Nutrition Facts label because of his prior success designing the EnergyGuide that appears on all major appliances in the U.S. Because Congress had mandated the reformulation of the label but not its redesign, Belser undertook the project as a pro bono effort, for which he received a Presidential Design Award from President Bill Clinton. Massimo Vignelli called it a \\"masterpiece.\\"July 1996 AIGA Journal The success of that initiative led the FDA to once again call on Belser to design the Drug Facts label that now appears on all over-the-counter drugs. On another vastly different design front, Belser began working with law firms shortly after the Bates v. State Bar of Arizona decision allowed lawyers to advertise. Over the next 30 years, the sustained body of work emanating from Greenfield/Belser Ltd., influenced countless others in their approach to law firm marketing. Career Belser held two jobs after college before beginning his career as a freelance designer. After returning from a year at the University of Montpellier in southern France in 1969-1970, Belser joined the provocative magazine published by Ralph Ginzburg, Avant Garde, in New York City, ultimately becoming its circulation director. After a year at the magazine, Belser left to travel from Istanbul to Kathmandu. Upon returning, he settled in Washington, D.C. and became the business manager for The Righteous Apple, a graphic design studio created for the non-profit black cultural arts organization, New Thing Art & Architecture Center. After 18 months, Belser left to build a freelance career. In 1978, he incorporated Burkey Belser, Inc, the same year he married Donna Greenfield who created Greenfield/Belser, Inc, a design consultancy focused on professional services. The businesses were merged in 1984 to create Greenfield/Belser Ltd. Belser's first brochure for a law firm was designed in 1983 for the Virginia firm of McGuire Woods & Battle. It was a 12-page hardcover book, modeled on 18th century book design. The brochure took a Gold Award at the Art Directors Club of Washington, D.C., proving that design for law firms could be done in an instructive, informative and innovative manner. Belser quickly expanded the tactical and graphical legal vocabulary, creating the very first ads for a law firm, Howrey & Simon, in 1992. He was also among the first to create a law firm logo, a \\"designed\\" law firm website, law firm newsletters and every other marketing tool that corporations use routinely today but that were simply unknown in the legal industry at that time. The transformation of marketing in the legal industry was not unlike that of the banking industry in the 1970s and the accounting industry shortly thereafter‚Äîall of which had been for centuries either not permitted to \\"advertise\\" or bound by custom and decorum from doing so. Publications Belser authored 25 Years of Legal Branding (Sunnyside Press) published in 2004, a compilation of the Greenfield/Belser Ltd's work from 1979-2004. His work also appears in other publications including: Absolutely the Newest Logos, Best of Corporate Identity Design, Big Book of Corporate Identity Designs (Watson-Guptill), Big Book of Design Ideas (Collins Design), Big Book of Letterhead and website Designs (Watson-Guptill), Global Corporate Identity, Global Graphics: Symbols (Rockport Publishing), HOW Colossal Design, Large Graphics (Rockport Publishing), The Newest Logos, Promotions that Work (Rockport Publishing), Small Graphics (Rockport Publishing),White Graphics (Rockport Publishing). Awards Belser was one of nine judges for the 2007 Communication Arts Design Annual, regarded by many as the nation's most prestigious graphic design competition. Since 1974, Belser has won hundreds of awards for his work in graphic design. Some of the competitions that have awarded him for his work include: AIGA 50, American Corporate Identity, Lifetime Achievement Award from the Art Directors Club of Metropolitan Washington, Communication Arts (Illustration Annual), Creativity magazine, American Graphic Design Awards (Graphic Design: USA), Graphis Inc., International Engraved Graphics Association, Legal Marketing Association Your Honor Awards, Logo 2000, 2002, Los Angeles Society of Illustrators, Print, Society for Marketing Professional Services, Webby Awards.

Lambert's works, best known as the Penny and Tippy Parrish series, focused on the lives and coming-of-age choices of the wives and children, especially the daughters, of U.S. Army officers during World War II and the Korean War-era. Family life Lambert was born Maude Janet \\"Dodi\\" Snyder December 12 or 17, 1893 in or near Crawfordsville, Indiana, the daughter of Mabel Galey and Francis Leonidas Snyder. She married Kent Craig Lambert (1891‚Äì1982) on January 1, 1918. Kent, a brother of longtime Purdue basketball coach, Ward Lambert, was a 1913 graduate of Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana. Serving in World War I, he continued his Army career as a cavalry officer. In World War II, he saw service in North Africa, Anzio and China. His last posting was as post commander of Fort Jay, Governors Island, in New York City where he retired at the rank of colonel in 1951 after 34 years active duty. A photograph of Janet and Kent's formal military farewell from Fort Jay and the Army illustrated the dust jacket of one of her books. While not well documented, Janet Lambert performed on the Broadway stage in the years before and during World War I. The couple had one daughter, Jeanne Anne Lambert (born 1918) who, much like a character in her mother's books, married a United States Military Academy graduate, Second Lieutenant Dean Titus Vanderhoef (USMA 1940), at Fort Jay's post chapel on July 27, 1940. Literary Legacy Lambert's life experience as an Army wife provided the background and settings for many of her books about the lives of teenage children of military officers. While the U.S. Military Academy figures appear frequently in the lives of her characters, her husband did not attend West Point, gaining his officer training through the National Guard and mid-level Army schools such at the United States Army Cavalry School at Fort Riley, Kansas. In 1930, he was instructor at the Virginia Military Institute. As for her female characters, often military wives or children, she drew on her experiences and observations as a military wife who had to balance career aspirations and married life. Janet Lambert died on March 16, 1973 at Beach Haven, New Jersey and is buried with her husband in Crawfordsville, Indiana.

Daytime divided into 12 parts. The Luxor Obelisk in Place de la Concorde, Paris, France The ancient Egyptians were one of the first cultures to widely divide days into generally agreed-upon equal parts, using early timekeeping devices such as sundials, shadow clocks, and merkhets (plumb-lines used by early astronomers). Obelisks are used by reading the shadow that it makes. The citizens could divide the day into two parts, and then into smaller hours. Sundials and shadow clocks Despite Herodotus's attribution of the invention of the sundial to the Babylonians in 430 BCE, the earliest known sundials were simple gnomons of Egyptian origin invented around 3500 BCE . More complex devices were developed over time, the earliest surviving one is a limestone sundial that dates back to 1500 BCE, discovered in the Valley of the Kings in 2013. It was found in a housing area of construction workers and its division of daytime into 12 parts was possibly used to measure work hours. Shadow clocks were modified sundials that allowed for greater precision in determining the time of day, and were first used around 1500 BCE. Their major innovation was a modified, more precise gnomon that allowed for the division of night time into 50 parts, with an additional two \\"twilight hours\\" in the morning and evening. The shadow clock gnomon was made up of a long stem divided into six parts, as well as an elevated crossbar that cast a shadow over the marks. This early clock was positioned eastward in the morning, while at noon it was rotated to face west to measure shadows cast by the setting sun. The concept of measured shadows were adapted into larger, more public designs in the form of obelisks. Markers around the obelisk would indicate units of time, including morning and afternoon as well as the summer and winter solstices for ceremonial purposes. Merkhets Using plumb-lines called merkhets, the Egyptians could calculate time at night, provided the stars were visible. Used since at least 600 BCE, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the North pole star, creating a north-south meridian. By observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets, they could accurately gauge time.

Biography =Early life= His father, William Kerner, was a leader of the international peace movement following WWII, joining with Paul Robeson and other notable figures in supporting a non-belligerent US foreign policy particularly in regards to the Soviet Union and China. William Kerner died of myasthenia gravis in 1954. Mathew's mother remarried in 1956 becoming the wife of longshoreman Jerome Callahan. Mat henceforth used the name Callahan. He spent his childhood at Peters Wright Creative Dance, founded by his grandaunt, Anita Peters and her husband Dexter Wright in 1912. His grandmother (Anita's youngest sister), Lenore Job, also a choreographer, dancer and teacher, was the director of the school when Callahan was born. His mother, Judy Job, followed her mother's lead also pursuing choreography, dancing and teaching. Peters Wright Creative Dance was a direct descendant of the movement inspired by Isadora Duncan. New attitudes towards, women, education and society were embodied in this approach whose influence continued to spread during the 20th century as Modern Dance. From childhood to adolescence, Callahan studied and performed at Peters Wright. His last dance performance was in Charles Weidman's Christmas Oratorio presented on the altar of newly completed Grace Cathedral in San Francisco in 1965. In 1964, exposure to the sounds of rock 'n' roll culminated in Callahan taking up guitar and starting the first of many bands. He began working with the San Francisco Mime Troupe and co-founded the Mime Troupe-sponsored band, Red Rock. This was followed by Prairie Fire, a militant duet that performed all over the U.S., in conjunction with innumerable campaigns and organizations fighting suffering and injustice. During this time, he became involved with the Black Panthers and other revolutionaries, and refused induction into the U.S. Army. After Prairie Fire, Callahan started a band called the Looters. =The Looters= The Looters began as a funky, political rock band playing in the legendary underground bohemian hang-out The Offensive, in the Mission District of San Francisco (where most of the original band members lived). The band grew to become a popular, critically renowned, musical trailblazer and led the Bay Area's ‚Äúworldbeat‚Äù musical movement in the 1980s. In 1983, the Looters were invited to play several dates in Nicaragua by the Association of Sandinista Cultural Workers and the Managua television station, being the first U.S. rock band to play there after the revolution. They headlined a stadium show in front of over 28,000 people in Managua, and returned home to further embrace a style of rock music influenced by ‚Äúworld‚Äù rhythms and beats. In 1986, the Looters toured Europe, supporting their first EP on Alternative Tentacles records, a label founded by iconic punk rocker Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys. The EP won a Bay Area Music Award ‚ÄúBammie‚Äù for ‚ÄúBest Independent Album‚Äù. Callahan became established as the group's lead singer and songwriter, and remained in that capacity throughout the bands‚Äô run. By happenstance, Island Records‚Äô head Chris Blackwell heard the Looters' EP playing in a New York record store and tracked the band down and signed them. The result was the release of Flashpoint on Island Records in 1987, nudging the band into mainstream awareness. Elements of reggae, rock, funk and afro-caribbean rhythms combined to shape the Looters sound and anchored their attraction as a top live act. The Looters put on passionate, sweaty, exciting stage shows, still playing at illegal venues but also at major concerts, such as opening for the Grateful Dead in their legendary New Year's Eve shows at the Oakland (CA) Coliseum with the Neville Brothers. They added Canada and Europe to their regular tour schedule and became a consistent touring act. Komotion International Also in 1986, Callahan co-founded the artists‚Äô collective Komotion International, an innovative member ‚Äì run nightclub, gallery, studio, and widely read magazine, which Callahan wrote for and edited. Komotion became an important and fertile social and political focus for the Mission District community and for San Francisco in general. In musical history, it became an incubator and spawning ground for such artists as Primus with Les Claypool, The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy with Michael Franti and Charlie Hunter, and Consolidated. Artists from many continents utilized Komotion's recording studio and support membership to create lasting works. For more than a decade, Komotion was a center for opposition and creativity centered in the political hotbed of San Francisco. Early on Callahan composed the Komotion Kredo: Because :Because we celebrate life and battle :Because we are not satisfied :Because it is up to us :Because we love to sing and dance :Because the pressure is upon us :Because there are governments and borders and cops and courts :Because the boundaries must be broken :Because we are out of control :Because they said we couldn't do it :Because we feel like it In 1989 the Looters released Sides, an EP on Raizer X Records, then hit their arguably creative peak with releases Jericho Down and Imago Mundi on Monster Music records. Jericho Down was perhaps their most critically acclaimed album, as the band received their second nomination for a ‚ÄúBest Independent Album‚Äù Bay Area Music Award, and won ‚ÄúBest Pop Indie Label Release of 1991 by WARD Music Monthly. Larry Canale of CD Review stated they were ‚Äúa band that‚Äôs quietly creating some of the most riveting, relevant world/pop music today‚Äù and that in concert ‚Äúthe group is absolutely riveting.‚ÄùCanale, L: \\"The Looters\\", CD Review, 1991, page 80 Industry bible Billboard magazine raved about the bands‚Äô ‚Äúsuperb musicianship that transcends any single genre.‚ÄùRussell, D: \\"Grass Route\\", Billboard, 1991 San Francisco Examiner critic Philip Elwood called the album ‚Äúa major achievement‚Äù and that the band was ‚Äúa treasure in the music business.‚ÄùElwood, P: \\"Jazz Beat\\", San Francisco Examiner, September 27, 1991, page D-18 Imago Mundi, named after Columbus‚Äôs book of maps on the 500th anniversary of his ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù, turned out to be the band's swan song. Featuring the Tower of Power horn section, the album was a final swing through the musical styles of rock, afrobeat, Cuban, soca and funk. Callahan's songwriting increasingly included multi-part harmonies that created song melodies and ‚Äúhooks‚Äù distinctive to rock music of the day, while focusing lyrically on social and economic justice. Callahan led the band through a final tour with some new band members, but decided to end the band's run soon thereafter. Summing up the band, Stephen Ostick of the Winnipeg (Canada) Free Press stated, ‚Äúa set with the Looters remains a one-of-a-kind experience. One can still say with certainty you‚Äôve never seen or heard anything like the Looters.‚ÄùOstick, S: \\"US Band Still Outstanding in New Form\\", Winnipeg Free Press, November 29, 1991, page D43 =Solo career= Callahan returned to San Francisco to produce projects by artists such as Stephen Yerkey and the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy (Island Records). He was awarded the ‚ÄúGoldie‚Äù Award in 1992, which honored ‚ÄúLocal Heroes and their contribution to the community‚Äù by the San Francisco weekly news magazine the Bay Guardian.Fine, J: \\"Local Heroes\\", The Bay Guardian, July, 1992 He also served as President of the Board of Directors for the Bay Area Center for Arts and Technology, a non- profit arts organization. He formed the band The Wild Bouquet which released two albums and toured in Europe, which led to Callahan's relocation to Switzerland where he lives to this day. After two solo European releases (Testimony, a ‚Äúgreatest hits‚Äù compilation and San Francisco), Callahan released his first U.S. solo album A Wild Bouquet (Broken Arrow Records) which featured remastered songs from the out-of-print Wild Bouquet albums along with a new tract introducing popular Swiss vocalist Yvonne Moore to U.S. audiences. The album also featured musicians Les Claypool (Primus), Joe Gore (P.J. Harvey) and Brain (Tom Waits). In 1999, Callahan wrote and produced Yvonne Moore's second album Between You and I and went on to produce and write songs for her subsequent releases Nomad and Put Out the Trash. This grew into a performing collaboration between the two and ultimately the recording and release of Welcome in 2007. On Welcome, Callahan's acoustic guitar was the only instrumental accompaniment to the duo's vocals. Labeled ‚Äúnew folk‚Äù music, its ‚Äúback porch‚Äù feel was far from the global arrangements and big productions of The Looters. Also in 2007, Callahan produced the album Nectar by his daughter, singer Shannon Callahan, in Berlin, Germany. Callahan and Moore released Burn the Boogeyman, their follow up to Welcome in 2009. =Books= Callahan's lyrics have always been a significant focus of his music and acclaim. J.H. Tompkins, music editor of the San Francisco Bay Guardian stated that Callahan ‚Äúwrites lyrics as rich in allegory and purpose as anything you‚Äôll run into this side of the Old Testament‚Äù and that ‚Äúhe just can‚Äôt help but write beautiful songs‚Äù.Tompkins, J.H.: \\"Looters, Imago Mundi\\", The Bay Guardian, December, 1992, page 45 So it was an obvious extension to see his lyrics comprise the book Testimony (Freedom Voices), a collaboration with Swiss artist and illustrator Mariann Muller. Published in 2000, the book featured 40 full color reproductions of Muller's paintings combined with the text of Callahan's songs from the Looters‚Äô and Wild Bouquet albums. Other published works of Callahan are Sex, Death and the Angry Young Man (Times Change Press, 1991) and The Trouble with Music (AK Press, 2005). The Trouble with Music, a study of (pop) music history, technology, music making and music ownership and copyrights,Callahan, M: The Trouble with Music, A.K. Press, 2005 placed Callahan as a guest lecturer on college campuses throughout the U.S., in 2005. He spoke at institutions such as New York University, Berklee School of Music, Oberlin, Albright, and Stanford Law School. He appeared in forums such as the Brecht Forum and Left Forum in New York City, and in countless bookstores and activist collectives. The book also led him to a friendship and collaboration with folk music pioneer Pete Seeger. Callahan presented Seeger's program for Public Domain reform to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) conference in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2007. January, 2017, saw the publication of Callahan's book, The Explosion of Deferred Dreams. (PM Press) The book explores the musical renaissance and social revolution that took place in San Francisco between the years 1965-1975. Providing a critical reexamination of a period which shaped San Francisco's global reputation over the subsequent fifty years, The Explosion of Deferred Dreams explores the dynamic links between the Black Panther Party and Sly and the Family Stone, the United Farm Workers and Santana (band), the Indian Occupation of Alcatraz and the San Francisco Mime Troupe, and the New Left and the Counterculture. Also in 2017, A Critical Guide to Intellectual Property (Zed Books) was published. This book is an edited collection of essays addressing many aspects of the current debates surrounding copyright, patent and trademark. Callahan is both co-editor, along with Jim Rogers, and contributing author of this volume.

Sagheddu had an intense spiritual devotion to ecumenism ‚Äì something for which she had offered her life ‚Äì since she desired that all would become one in Jesus Christ. Her childhood saw her noted as stubborn and obstinate though her increased activeness in teaching catechism and joining Azione Cattolica saw those qualities melt and become gentleness and careful attentiveness. Sagheddu was beatified in Rome in 1983. Life Maria Sagheddu was born to shepherds in Dorgali on 17 March 1914 as the fifth of eight children to Marcantonio Sagheddu and Caterina Cucca. Her father and one brother died in 1919 as did two other brothers sometime in their childhood. Sagheddu was said to be obstinate as a child but was also known to be obedient; she was also described as being prone to laziness on occasion. Once she concluded her initial education as a child she had to leave school to help out at home where she showed herself serious and endowed with a great sense of care and dutiful obedience. Yet she was often quick to criticize what she disliked and quick to ask for what she wanted. There was one occasion when her mother asked her to throw out some potato peels though she ignored this despite her mother's firm insistence that she do so. Sagheddu relented and did this but returned a moment later with the peels in hand in which she decided she did not want to throw them. Sagheddu was ranked among the best at her school where she was alert and intelligent; she excelled in arithmetic most of all her other subjects. The death of her little sister Giovanna Antonia (whom she was closest to and was born in 1915) in 1932 prompted her to deepen her faith and she decided to enroll in Azione Cattolica not long after this. It was there that she began to instruct the local children and adolescents in the faith and also to help the aged of the region. In the process she began to augment her spiritual and contemplative life; she at first taught catechism with a stick in hand. But the local priest took the stick from her on one occasion and replaced it with a note that said: \\"Arm yourself with patience, not a stick\\". Sagheddu accepted the criticism and changed her methods from that moment on. Father Meloni helped her in entering the religious life for he was the single individual she had confided her dream in. Her mother approved this but reproached her for not having told her sooner. One brother even disapproved of her decision and believed that she would bring nothing more than disgrace upon their home. On 30 September 1935 she entered the Trappists at their convent in Grottaferrata near Rome where she was given the religious name of Maria Gabriella; she was clothed in the habit for the first time on 13 April 1936 and made her vows on 31 October 1937 which marked the Feast of Christ the King. The abbess of the convent at that time there was Mother Maria Pia Gullini whose enthusiasm for ecumenism (a fruit of the efforts of Abb√© Paul Couturier) was passed on to the others there. Sagheddu became an ardent devotee to this cause and she offered herself as a spiritual sacrifice for the unification of the Christian Church during the special week for Christian unification in 1938. Sagheddu fell ill with tuberculosis after a diagnosis in Rome and suffered with the disease for fifteen months before she died during the evening on 23 April 1939: the doctors had declared her condition incurable in May 1938. The significant fact here is that the Gospel reading for that week included the words: \\"There will be one flock and one shepherd\\" (John 10:16). Sagheddu's remains are kept in a chapel at a Trappistine convent at Vitorchiano near Viterbo and were found to be incorrupt in 1957 upon exhumation. Spirituality Sagghedu was moved by a profound feeling of thanks to God for imparting his grace to her and for calling her to consecrate herself to Him and to unite with Him. Sagheddu also found rest from anxious bouts through a complete and trusting abandonment of herself to the will of God to whom she placed total trust in. Pope John Paul II referred to her in his papal encyclical Ut Unum Sint in which he said: > Praying for unity is not a matter reserved only to those who actually > experience the lack of unity among Christians. In the deep personal dialogue > which each of us must carry on with the Lord in prayer, concern for unity > cannot be absent. ...It was in order to reaffirm this duty that I set before > the faithful of the Catholic Church a model which I consider exemplary, the > model of a Trappistine Sister, Blessed Maria Gabriella of Unity, whom I > beatified on 25 January 1983. Sister Maria Gabriella, called by her vocation > to be apart from the world, devoted her life to meditation and prayer > centered on chapter seventeen of Saint John's Gospel, and offered her life > for Christian unity. ...The example of Sister Maria Gabriella is > instructive; it helps us to understand that there are no special times, > situations or places of prayer for unity. Christ's prayer to the Father is > offered as a model for everyone, always and everywhere. Beatification Blessed Maria Gabriela first class ex corp. relic of the Trappist Cistercian nun. \\"Ut Unum Sint\\" The beatification cause opened in Frascati in 1958 and she became titled as a Servant of God though the formal introduction of the cause came under Pope Paul VI on 15 July 1965. Pope John Paul II named her as Venerable on 4 May 1981 after confirming her life of heroic virtue. Sagghedu was beatified on 25 January 1983 in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls at the conclusion of the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity which was the same observance which motivated her decision to offer her life to God. In doing so John Paul II both affirmed the holiness of her actions and set her up as a role model for Christians to follow more so as it related to ecumenism and ecumenical efforts. After Sagghedu's death it was noted that in her bible the seventeenth chapter of John's Gospel had become yellowed and worn from being often read. It is in this chapter that Jesus appeals to the God the Father on behalf of His disciples. But of particular significance are verses 11 and 21 in which Jesus prays \\"that they may be one, as we also are\\" (John 17:11) and \\"that they all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me\\" (John 17:21). These verses are used as a motto for the ecumenical movement. The current postulator for the cause is the Trappist nun Augusta Tescari.

It drafts New Zealand Government Bills (except Inland Revenue Bills) and Legislative Instruments. It publishes all New Zealand Bills, Acts, and Legislative Instruments in print and on the New Zealand Legislation website.  History  In the years before the enactment of the Statutes Drafting and Compilation Act 1920, the role of Law Draftsman was housed within several different offices. In 1920, the Law Drafting Office was established as a separate Office of Parliament by statute. In 1973, the Law Drafting Office was renamed the Parliamentary Counsel Office. The principal officers of the office were also renamed: the Law Draftsman became the Chief Parliamentary Counsel and Assistant Law Draftsmen were renamed as Parliamentary Counsel. In 1985, the Fourth Labour Government reformed the public service via the Parliamentary Service Act 1985. It abolished the Legislative Department and replaced it with a Parliamentary Service and Parliamentary Service Commission. It also ensured that PCO staff, aside from principal officers, were appointed by the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, within maximum numbers set by the Attorney-General. In 2000, the Parliamentary Service Act 2000 repealed the 1985 Act. In 2012, the Legislation Act 2012 modernised the law for publishing, making available, reprinting, and revising official versions of legislation. This was the Government‚Äôs response to recommendations made in two reports by the Law Commission, and recommendations made by previous Regulations Review Committees. NZLC R107 pages 30‚Äì33 has a more detailed Parliamentary Counsel Office history.  Organisation  The Parliamentary Counsel Office is an executive agency of the New Zealand Parliament and is under the control of the Attorney-General.  Functions  PCO's Parliamentary Counsel are responsible for drafting most New Zealand legislation and publishing the official version of New Zealand Acts of Parliament and Statutory Regulations. Under section 59 of the Legislation Act 2012 the functions of the PCO are to: * draft government Bills and Legislative Instruments; * publish Bills, Acts, Legislative Instruments, and reprints of legislation in electronic and printed forms; * prepare reprints of Acts and Legislative Instruments; * prepare Bills to revise Acts in accordance with the current revision programme; * advise departments and agencies on the drafting of disallowable instruments that are not drafted by the PCO; * examine local and private Bills, and Members' Bills that the Attorney-General directs to be examined; and * advise on and assist with the drafting of all local and private Bills, and draft Members' Bills on the Attorney-General's direction. From time to time, the PCO may also draft certain other instruments at the direction of the Attorney-General or the Chief Parliamentary Counsel. The Inland Revenue Department is authorised to draft certain Inland Revenue Bills. The PCO is responsible for supplying printed copies of Bills and Supplementary Order Papers (SOPs) to the House.

Formed in 1991, the band has toured in the United States, Canada, and Europe, with occasional performances in South America and North Africa. Mississippi Heat has recorded 12 albums: four on Van der Linden Records, the band's own label (1992‚Äì1998),\\"Handyman\\" (1998), the fourth CD on Van der Linden Records, was licensed in 1999 by CrossCut Records, with 2 bonus tracks three on the European label CrossCut Records (1998‚Äì2005) and six with Chicago label Delmark Records since 2005. The band also released a live DVD in 2005. Birth of Mississippi Heat Mississippi Heat grew out of a 1991 gig at Cafe Lura, in Chicago, when guitarist and singer Jon McDonald invited Lacocque to join him onstage.Much of the information presented here was drawn from interviews with Pierre Lacocque conducted in 2014 by Daniel L√©on, published in Soul Bag Magazine (no. 216, Oct.‚ÄìNov.‚ÄìDec. 2014, and no. 217, Jan.‚ÄìFeb.‚ÄìMar. 2015), and an interview conducted by Niles Frantz in 1998, published as \\"A conversation with band leader Pierre Lacocque‚Äù in Chicago Blues Guide (revised in 2006). McDonald had hired drummer and vocalist Robert \\"Golden Voice\\" Covington (Robert Lee Travis, who was then working with Sunnyland Slim) and bassist Bob Stroger (also with Sunnyland Slim and with Jimmy Rogers). That night went so well the quartet decided to form Mississippi Heat. Lacocque‚Äôs brother Michel, who was also in attendance, volunteered to become their manager. McDonald left the band soon after and was later replaced by Billy Flynn and James Wheeler. Covington became lead vocalist and was replaced on drums by Bob Carter and later by Allen Kirk. Recording history In 1992, the band released its first album, Straight from the Heart, with Covington on drums and vocals, Stroger on bass, Flynn and Wheeler on guitars, and Lacocque on the harmonica. The album includes the song \\"Heartbroken,\\" a track recorded without rehearsals and in only one take. The song was written by Lacocque for his late mentor and friend Sonny Wimberly, a blues bassist who had recorded with Little Walter, Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley. Wimberly died in 1991, months before he and Lacocque had planned to record together. Straight from the Heart is Mississippi Heat's only album with Covington on vocals. He became increasingly busy working with Sunnyland Slim and had steady work under his own name at the famed Chicago club Kingston Mines. (Wheeler occasionally performed with him there and also with the Frank Pellegrino Blues Band.) In 1993, Covington was replaced by Deitra Farr on lead vocals and Allen Kirk on drums. Farr performed on the albums Learned the Hard Way (1994) and Thunder in My Heart. (Farr returned as a guest vocalist on three songs on the album Delta Bound, released in 2012). Katherine Davis, Zora Young and Mary Lane performed briefly with Mississippi Heat.Katherine Davis: Handyman, 1998/1999. Three songs: ‚ÄúExcuse Me‚Äù, ‚ÄúThese Men Look Good to Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Cross Me.‚Äù Zora Young also appears on one song on the same CD, ‚ÄúStay with Me‚Äù. Inetta Visor took over as the band's vocalist in 2001 and has been with the band for 15 years (2001‚Äìpresent). She is featured on 8 of the 12 recordings. Flynn and Wheeler performed on Mississippi Heat's first three albums. Since then the band's recordings have featured guitarists Chris Winters, Steve Doyle, Billy Satterfield and Michael Dotson (2012‚Äìpresent).Dotson was a member of Magic Slim's band for six years (1998‚Äì2003). Over the years Mississippi Heat has recorded and traveled with two permanent guest artists: Carl Weathersby (1997‚Äìpresent)Carl Weathersby appears on seven Mississippi Heat recordings: Handyman (1998‚Äì1999), Footprints on the Ceiling (2002), Glad You're Mine (2005), Hattiesburg Blues (2008), Let's Live It Up (2010), Delta Bound (2012), and Warning Shot (2014). and Lurrie Bell (2005‚Äìpresent).Both recordings are on Delmark Records: One Eye Open: Live at Rosas‚Äô Lounge, Chicago (a 2005 live CD/DVD) and Hattiesburg Blues (2008). Mississippi Heat has also recorded with guest stars Sam Lay and Calvin Jones (on Straight from the Heart, 1992), Billy Boy Arnold (on Handyman, 1998/1999, and Footprints on the Ceiling, 2002), John Primer (on Let‚Äôs Live It Up, 2010), Chubby Carrier (on Delta Bound, 2012), and Sax Gordon (on Warning Shot, 2014, and \\"Cab Driving Man\\", 2016). Keyboard player Chris \\"Hambone\\" Cameron and percussionist Ruben Alvarez also perform on several of the band's albums.Cameron played on Footprints on the Ceiling (2003); Glad You‚Äôre Mine (2005), Hattiesburg Blues (2008), Let‚Äôs Live It Up (2010), Delta Bound (2012), and \\"Cab Driving Man\\" (2016). Alvarez played percussion on the albums Hattiesburg Blues (2008), Delta Bound (2012), Warning Shot\\" (2014), and \\"Cab Driving Man\\" (2016). The vintage blues-heavy 16-track record Warning Shot, released in 2014, features vocalist Visor, Lacocque on harmonica, Dotson on guitar and vocals, Brian Quinn on bass, Kenny Smith and Andrew ‚ÄúBlaze‚Äù Thomas on drums and vocals, Giles Corey on guitar and Neal O'Hara on keyboards. It also includes guest artists Gordon on tenor and baritone saxophones, Alvarez on Latin percussion (his third album with Mississippi Heat), Weathersby on guitar (his seventh album with the band) and background vocalists Mae Koen, Diane Madison and Nanette Frank, who have worked with Aretha Franklin. Musical style Mississippi Heat describes its musical style as having roots in the golden era of Chicago blues in the 1950s. Lacocque cites Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Howlin' Wolf, Jimmy Reed, Big Walter Horton, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson I, Sonny Boy Williamson II and Junior Wells as influences. Lacocque said in a 2014 interview that although some white harmonica players, such as Paul Butterfield and Charlie Musselwhite have influenced him, \\"it is the musical history and heritage of African-Americans that have really had an impact on my playing.\\" Lacocque has stressed that he is also drawn to new ideas. \\"We are very attracted to the traditional Chicago blues and the Chicago blues sound, for sure. But we want to bring something fresh and exciting to the culture as well,\\" he told Blues Blast Magazine in 2013. In a 2014 interview with the blog Friday Blues Fix, Lacocque said that some of his favorite recordings are Chess Records' collections of music by artists Willie Dixon, Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. He told WBEZ in 2011 that he listens to much Latin music, because his wife is from Cuba. The band's motto is \\"Traditional Blues with a Unique Sound.\\" Background Lacocque was born to Christian parents in Israel and lived France and Germany until, when he was five years old, his family settled in Brussels, Belgium, where his father was a professor of Old Testament studies. When Lacocque was age two and a half, his father gave him a toy harmonica. He would later recall that the beautiful sounds that came from it made him cry. His family played mostly classical music at home, but his musical tastes grew as he listened to pop songs and friends' records. Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and Otis Redding were his favorite artists when he was growing up. He discovered the blues at age 16, in the summer of 1969, after he moved to the U.S. with his family. Lacocque heard Big Walter Horton play on the University of Chicago campus, near the Chicago Theological Seminary, where his father had joined the faculty. Then a student at the University of Chicago Lab Schools, he bought a harmonica just days later from Hyde Park's original Harper Court mall and began practicing. \\"Not only did I hear mesmerizing amplified harmonica sounds for the first time in my life but the music made me feel that a family was calling out to me,\\" Lacocque said in a 2014 interview. \\"I felt drawn towards it like a powerful magnet. I couldn't resist.\\" Several months after he began practicing, Lacocque met and performed onstage with Junior Wells at Theresa's Lounge, located at 4801 S. Indiana Ave. (the club closed in 1983). The next year, Lacocque left for Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to attend McGill University, where he studied psychology and received a bachelor's degree in 1974 and a master's degree in 1976. While in school Lacocque played for the Albert Failey Blues Band and the rock-inspired Oven, which won the 1976 Montreal Battle of the Bands. But the promoter who promised a record deal went missing, and Lacocque returned to Chicago. For several years after graduating Lacocque focused on his work as a psychologist. He received a Ph.D. from Northwestern University in 1980. In 1988 at age 36, he decided to take up the harmonica again. Lacocque played with Chicago blues bands, such as Tre and the Blue Nights and the Blue Mirror Band, before forming Mississippi Heat in 1991.

It is the oldest continuously running hospital in the Navy medical system. History The historic Portsmouth Naval Hospital building was designed by architect John Haviland (1792‚Äì1852) and built in 1827. It is a three-story granite and Freestone building on a basement. Its form is that of a hollow rectangle, measuring wide by deep. The front facade features a wide Doric order portico with ten columns. The building's interior was reconstructed in 1907, and a shallow dome was added to the roof. Located on the property are a contributing marker erected by Haviland over the grave of Major Saunders, one time commander of Forts Nelson and Norfolk, who died March 15, 1810; and a memorial cannon commemorating Fort Nelson. Fort Nelson, now demolished, was near the hospital's site. and Accompanying photo The hospital staff has a long tradition of providing service to the fleet. In the summer of 1832 during a massive cholera outbreak, naval doctors, nurses, and attendants remained on duty caring for patients throughout the epidemic, working heroically to check the ravages of the disease and to allay patients' fears.Sharp, John G. Cholera at Gosport Navy Yard 1832 http://www.usgwarchives.net/va/portsmouth/shipyard/nnysharp5.html accessed 7 March 2019Register of Patients Gosport Naval Hospital August 1832 cholera cases Early Navy Medicine In 1798, Congress established the ‚ÄúHospital Fund‚Äù to provide medical treatment that formerly had been administered to officers, sailors and marines ashore in sail lofts, storerooms or other work spaces at Gosport Shipyard. By 1821, enough money had been collected to build naval hospitals in key ports. In 1830, the Navy‚Äôs first hospital opened in Portsmouth. Before then, what is now Hospital Point was the site of Fort Nelson. That fort had protected the area from the British during the Revolutionary War. Several decades later, Fort Nelson fell into disrepair from neglect when Fort Monroe became the protector of the harbor. Construction of the hospital began in 1827. Workers removed more than 500,000 bricks from Fort Nelson and re-used them in the hospital‚Äôs foundation and inner walls. In 1830, Surgeon Thomas Williamson was ordered to make the hospital ready to receive patients. Dr. Williamson became Medical Director of the nation‚Äôs first naval hospital. It is on the National Register of Historical Places. Early Civilian Workers Through the early nineteenth century, both Norfolk (Gosport) Navy Yard and Naval Hospital extensively utilized enslaved labor (see thumbnail 1832 hospital muster). On 2 January 1832 in a letter to the Secretary of the Navy, Commodore Lewis Warrington confirmed enslaved labor at the hospital. Warrington stated \\" I knew that for ten years, that mode has been pursued without complaint or representation against it. In that time several Surgeons attached to the Hospital and several captains in command of the Yard all of whom acquiesced in it.\\"NARA M125 \\"Captains Letters\\" Lewis Warrington to the Secretary of the Navy, Volume 166 1 January 1832 - 31 January 1832 letter number 6 dated 2 January 1832 In a 5 January 1832 followup Warrington clarified that the hospital's female enslaved workers and their children had separate sleeping quarters.\\"[In] assigning reasons for the employment of Washers [laundresses] at the Hospital, I omitted to state that they were fixed in an outhouse at a considerable distance from the establishment and had no intercourse with it, but such as was allowed by the medical officer, consequently neither they nor their children could occasion any inconvenience or produce any irregularity.\\"\\"Captains Letters\\" Lewis Warrington to the Secretary of the Navy, dated 5 January1832 NARA M125 RG260 Volume 166, letter number 6Sharp, John G.\\"Send for a Midwife\\" African American Women as Nurses, Cooks, and Washers at Gosport (Norfolk) Naval Hospital 1815 ‚Äì 1842 http://www.usgwarchives.net/va/portsmouth/shipyard/gnhaafworkers.html Most of the staff took their meals (victualed) at the hospital. The enslaved workers and probably the steward Samuel McFall (white) and doorkeeper William Fell (white) lived on the grounds.Sharp, John .Gosport Naval Hospital Staff in 1834 accessed 21 September 2019 http://www.usgwarchives.net/va/portsmouth/shipyard/nnysharp10.html At the hospital enslaved African Americans worked in wide variety of occupations as nurses, attendants, hospital cooks, washers/laundresses, boatmen and gravediggers. In 1832 Madeline Flanders (see thumbnail)was the first women listed as a hospital nurse.NARA RG260 Miscellaneous Records of the Secretary of the Navy 1832 muster for Gosport Naval Hospital 1832 muster of Madeline Flanders nurse and other early Gosport Naval Hospital employees =Yellow Fever= In June 1855, the steamer Franklin put into Norfolk after sailing from the West Indies. Mosquitoes carrying Yellow Fever escaped when the vessel docked. As the mosquitoes spread, the local population quickly succumbed to the disease. Two months later, with 20 to 70 citizens a day being stricken, representatives of Portsmouth appealed to the Navy to help treat townspeople. The hospital was then opened to the local population and 587 citizens were treated. In appreciation, the Common Council of Portsmouth presented gold medals to six naval surgeons. =Navy‚Äôs First Corps School= In 1898, President William McKinley established the Navy Hospital Corps. The first Navy Corps School graduation took place at Portsmouth Naval Hospital in 1902 when 28 students completed the course. The outstanding lifesaving record of the corps while caring for the sick and wounded during battle and peacetime has made it one of the most decorated among the military services. =Navy Nurse Corps= Congress created the Navy Nurse Corps in 1908, allowing women to perform duties that previously had been done by men. They held no rank and were titled, ‚ÄúNurse.‚Äù The first 20 to graduate were known as the ‚ÄúSacred Twenty,‚Äù and of them, three reported for duty at Portsmouth in 1909. Among them was Lenah Higbee, who became Chief Nurse at Portsmouth, and later was the second Superintendent of Nurses for the U.S. Navy. In 1964, male nurses were allowed in the corps. Wartime =Civil War= Virginia seceded from the Union on April 17, 1861. On April 20, the Governor ordered the 3rd Virginia regiment to occupy and fortify the Naval Hospital grounds. A battery of earthen works was hastily erected on the point and renamed Fort Nelson, after the old Revolutionary War fort. During the Confederate occupation, the hospital served as a medical facility and a fort. The Union retook the area on May 10, 1862, and until the end of the war, the hospital cared for Union soldiers and Sailors. In 1865, the hospital treated nearly 1,300 patients. =Spanish-American War= After the Spanish defeat at the battle of Santiago, Cuba, in 1898, the sick and injured needed treatment. The hospital ship U.S.S. Solace transported fifty five sick U.S. Navy and forty eight wounded Spanish sailors to the hospital. The hospital staff treated the Spanish patients not as enemies, but as fellow seamen in distress. After the war, the Spanish Navy praised Portsmouth Naval Hospital for the compassion and humanitarian acts of kindness extended to them and their countrymen. Hospital Renovation By 1900, seventy years of time and use had taken its toll on the hospital. In 1907, hospital personnel moved patients to tent-covered wooden platforms constructed several hundred yards from the building. Patient care took place in the tents for nearly a year and a half while the hospital was renovated. During this period, two new wings and the Jeffersonian dome were added. The hospital reopened in February 1909. From 1910 to 1940, surgeries were performed under the dome by skylight. When the United States entered World War I, the hospital was immediately expanded. Several temporary wood-framed buildings were constructed to accommodate the growing number of patients. These buildings included 34 patient pavilions and four Hospital Corps barracks. During a one-month period in 1917, patients increased from 200 to 1,405. The largest monthly admissions were in October 1918 when patients numbered 2,257. Treatment of measles and mumps accounted for half of the patients. 1918 Influenza Pandemic In addition to wartime casualties, the naval hospital also treated large numbers of patients due to the great influenza pandemic of 1918. In the Fall of 1918 the influenza pandemic quickly devastated the Naval Training Station at Hampton Roads Virginia where it arrived on 13 September 1918. During the pandemic 3005 naval recruits at the training station contacted the disease and 175 of them died.Holbrook, Richmond A Century with Norfolk Naval Hospital (Printcraft Publishing Portsmouth Virginia 1930),p.417 Most of these recruits were treated at Norfolk Naval Hospital where the hospital general registers reflect the speedy spread of the virus. During the course of the pandemic many in the hospital staff contacted the disease while tending the sick. During the war, 19 Navy nurses died on active duty, over half of them from influenza. Among these were two members of the United States Navy Nurse Corps stationed at Norfolk Naval Hospital they were Hortense Elizabeth Wind USNR (1891 -1918) see thumbnail and Ann Marie Dahlby USNR (1892 -1918) both died after contacting the disease at the hospital, while treating ailing and dying sailors.17 Omaha Daily Bee,December 1918,p.2Sharp, John G.M.

The $1.5 million program increased the number of hospital beds to 3,441. A dental clinic, ships service, library and a bank were added. The staff ‚Äî medical officers, nurses, corpsmen, Marines and civilians ‚Äî swelled to 3,055. On a single day in August 1944, there were 2,997 patients. Between 1937 and 1948, residency and intern programs were established through the Graduate Medical Education system. The sprawling facility escaped post-war downsizing and went on to serve during the Korean War. Skyscraper Bldg. 215 (now Bldg. 3) was constructed to provide a modern 500-bed hospital and to centralize the medical departments scattered around the base. Towering seventeen stories, it was the tallest all-welded steel-framed building from New York to Miami. Along with the latest medical equipment, it had a cobbler shop, tailor shop, entertainment auditorium, Navy Exchange and modern galley. In 1973, twelve American prisoners of war from Vietnam were received on the 12th floor, where they were reunited with family and given time to recuperate. It served as the main hospital from 1959 to 1999. Charette Health Care Center The Charette Center was dedicated in April 1999 and is the third naval hospital built in Portsmouth. The 1 million square foot, five-story hospital contains 17 operating rooms, 300 exam rooms, 296 beds and 140 special treatment rooms. The center is named for Master Chief Corpsman William R. Charette, who served with the 1st Marine Division during the Korean Conflict. Charette came under hostile fire while helping the wounded. In spite of his own wounds, he continued to treat the injured Marines. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his gallantry.

It is a true bantam ‚Äì a miniature bird with no corresponding large version ‚Äì and is one of the oldest recorded British bantam breeds. It is named after Sir John Saunders Sebright, who created it as an ornamental breed by selective breeding in the early nineteenth century.Hobson, Jeremy and Lewis, Cecilia. Choosing & Raising Chickens: The complete guide to breeds and welfare. David and Charles publishing. London. 2009. p 85. The first poultry breed to have its own specialist club for enthusiasts, Sebrights were admitted to poultry exhibition standards not long after their establishment. Today, they are among the most popular of bantam breeds. Despite their popularity, Sebrights are often difficult to breed, and the inheritance of certain unique characteristics the breed carries has been studied scientifically. As a largely ornamental chicken, they lay tiny, white eggs and are not kept for meat production. History =Background= Sir John Saunders Sebright (1767‚Äì1846) was the 7th Sebright Baronet, and a Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire .Lee p. 1108 In addition to breeding chickens, cattle and other animals, Sir John wrote several influential pamphlets on animal keeping and breeding: The Art of Improving the Breeds of Domestic Animals (1809), Observations upon Hawking (1826), and Observations upon the Instinct of Animals (1836). A Silver Sebright hen Charles Darwin read Sir John's 1809 pamphlet, and was impressed with a passage that elaborated on how \\"the weak and the unhealthy do not live to propagate their infirmities\\".Ekarius p. 152 These writings, along with Darwin's correspondence via their mutual friend William Yarrell, aided Darwin in the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin's seminal work On the Origin of Species, first published in 1859, cited Sir John's experiments in pigeon breeding, and recalled \\"That most skilful breeder, Sir John Sebright, used to say, with respect to pigeons, that 'he would produce any given feather in three years, but it would take him six years to obtain head and beak.'\\" Darwin also cited Sir John extensively regarding the Sebright bantam, as well as pigeon and dog breeding, in his 1868 work Variation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication, his 1871 The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, and his book on Natural Selection (which was not published in his lifetime). Sebright set out to create a very small bantam chicken with laced plumage similar that of the laced Polish. Although the exact makeup of the breed is uncertain, it is thought that he created the gold Sebright by cross-breeding a buff Nankin bantam hen, a small gold-spangled Hamburgh-like hen and a small hen-feathered Pit Game cock; he later created the silver Sebright by crossing his golds with a white Rosecomb cock bought from the new Zoological Gardens of the Zoological Society of London, established in 1826. It is also possible that the hen-feathering characteristic derived from the Belgian Campine breed rather than from Pit Game. In about 1810, Sebright founded The Sebright Bantam Club, which was the first single-breed association for chickens.Graham p. 144 In 1853 the Sebright was described in the Poultry Book of William Wingfield and George William Johnson, with an illustration by Harrison Weir. It was included in the original Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry of William Bernhard Tegetmeier in 1865, and in the first Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1874. Today, the breed is one of the ten most popular bantam chickens, according to the American Bantam Association.Ekarius p. 153 Characteristics In accordance with the intentions of their creator, the Sebright is an ornamental bantam, and is commonly seen in competitive poultry shows. As a true bantam, all Sebrights are very small in stature; males weigh an average of 22 ounces (625 grams) and females 20 oz (570 g). Their short backs, proportionally large breasts, and downward-pointing wings combine to create an angular, jaunty look.Graham p. 145 { style=\\"background: none;\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\"  class=\\"thumbimage\\"  200px  class=\\"thumbimage\\"  230px - style=\\"vertical- align: top;\\"  The ideal Silver Sebright male, from The Standard of Perfection  The ideal Silver Sebright female, from The Standard of Perfection } In the United Kingdom, two colour variants are recognised, gold and silver; these have a base of either dark gold or whitish silver, evenly laced around the edges with black. In other European countries other colours have been created: a black-laced lemon Sebright arose as a sport in Holland in the mid- twentieth century, and a chamois or white-laced buff variant was bred towards the end of the century; it is recognised by the Entente Europ√©enne. The birds have unfeathered legs with slate-blue skin, and their beaks are ideally a dark horn colour. Cocks carry a rose comb covered with fine points, and a small spike that sweeps back from the head (called a leader). Combs, earlobes and wattles were originally a purple colour referred to in the fancy as mulberry,Australian Poultry Standards, 2nd Edition, published 2012 by Victorian Poultry Fanciers Association Ltd. trading as Poultry Stud Breeders and Exhibitors Victoria. but today are often bright red though mulberry is still desired according to the standards in most countries. Some breeders consider hen feathering to have an adverse effect on the fertility of male Sebrights, and may use cocks that don't carry the trait for breeding purposes, despite their automatic disqualification in shows.Graham p. 144-145 Characteristically, Sebrights are only one of a few chicken breeds in which the cocks are hen-feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickle-shaped feathers common in most cocks that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert an unusually large amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (oestrogens). =Husbandry= Sebrights are neither outstanding meat birds nor prolific egg layers ‚Äì hens lay some 60‚Äì80 creamy-white eggs per year.. They can prove to be particularly difficult to raise, especially for beginners. Hens rarely go broody and chicks usually have high mortality rates. Adults are generally hardy, but are especially susceptible to Marek's disease.Hobson p. 119 Like many bantams, they fly well, so are sometimes kept in confinement, and not allowed to range freely. Due to their genetic make-up, males may on occasion be born infertile, further complicating breeding.

Libraries, in particular public libraries, and modern digital technology such as the Internet play a key role, as they provide the masses with open access to information. Over the centuries, dissemination of information has risen to an unprecedented level. The start of this process can be marked from the printing press, the purpose of which was to spread information uniformly among masses. Today, in a digitized world, the availability of online content outnumbers the information published in books, journals or in any print form. History The printing press was one of the early steps towards the democratization of knowledge. Another small example of this during the Industrial Revolution was the creation of libraries for miners in some Scottish villages in the 18th century.For example, in Leadhills in 1741 and in Wanlockhead in 1756. Wikipedia is rapidly turning into a real- time reference tool in which public entries can be updated by anyone at any time. This phenomenon‚Äîa product of the digital age‚Äîhas greatly contributed to the democratization of knowledge in the post-modern era. At the same time, it has raised a number of valid criticisms in this regard (see Reliability of Wikipedia). For instance, one could draw a distinction between the mere spread of information and the spread of accurate or credible information. Wikipedia may thus be a more reliable source of information in certain spheres, but not necessarily in others. In the Digital Age The democratization of technology has played a major facilitating role. Wikipedia co-founder, Larry Sanger, states in his article, that \\"Professionals are no longer needed for the bare purpose of the mass distribution of information and the shaping of opinion.\\" Sanger's article confronts the existence of \\"common knowledge\\" and pits it against knowledge that everyone agrees on. In terms of democratization of knowledge, Wikipedia has played a major role. For instance, Wikipedia has attracted 400 million viewers across the globe and has communicated with them in over 300 languages. Google Books has been pointed to as an example of democratization of knowledge, but Malte Herwig in Der Spiegel raised concerns that the virtual monopoly Google has in the search market, combined with Google's hiding of the details of its search algorithms, could undermine this move towards democratization. After the most powerful search engine, Google, and the most viewed encyclopedia, Wikipedia, the most viewed information based website is Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Role of libraries An article written in 2005 by the editors of Reference & User Services Quarterly calls the library the greatest force for the democratization of knowledge or information.Wallace, D. P., & Van Fleet, C. (2005). The Democratization of Information?. Reference & User Services Quarterly, 45(2), 100-103. It continues to say that public libraries in particular are inextricably linked with the history and evolution of the United States, but school library media centers, college and university libraries, and special libraries have all also been influential in their support for democracy. Libraries play an essential role in the democratization of knowledge and information by providing communities with the resources and tools to find information free of charge. Democratic access to knowledge has also been co-opted to mean providing information in a variety of formats, which essentially means electronic and digital formats for use by library patrons.Cohen, D. (2014) An evolving, essential role for libraries. http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2014/9/30/evolving-essential- role-libraries/ Public libraries help further the democratization of information by guaranteeing freedom of access to information, by providing an unbiased variety of information sources and access to government services, as well as the promotion of democracy and an active citizenship.Ryyn√§nen, Mirja (n.d.). Democratization of Information: Information Literacy. http://docs.nigd.org/libraries/mumbai/reports/article-10.pdf Dan Cohen, the founding executive director of the Digital Public Library of America, writes that the democratic access to knowledge is a profound idea that requires constant tending and revitalization. In 2004, a World Social Forum and International workshop was held entitled \\"Democratization of Information: Focus on Libraries\\". The focus of the forum was to bring awareness to the social, technological, and financial challenges facing libraries dealing with the democratization of information. Social challenges included globalization and the digital divide, technological challenges included information sources, and financial challenges constituted shrinking budgets and manpower.Kademani, B.S. (2004). Democratization of Information: Focus on Libraries. Rapportuer- General‚Äôs Report. http://eprints.rclis.org/5045/1/Rapporteur-General-report- final.pdf Longtime Free Library of Philadelphia director Elliot Shelkrot said that \\"Democracy depends on an informed population.

It is the opening song on his fifth album, The River. It was recorded at The Power Station in New York in May or June 1979.Brucebase, On The Tracks: The River It was one of the earlier songs Springsteen wrote for The River, as it was written on the road during his 1978 tour. The song was also often performed during the latter part of that tour. \\"The Ties That Bind\\" was originally intended to be released as the title track of a single album that was to be released in 1979. This proposed album was eventually scrapped and expanded to become the double album The River. The contents of that album was released on December 4, 2015 as part of The Ties That Bind: The River Collection, the fifth disc of which contains the 60- minute documentary, The Ties That Bindhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt5161392/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/tv- listings-friday- november-27-2015/2015/11/26/a5b1aca2-92f8-11e5-a2d6-f57908580b1f_story.htmlhttp://www.salon.com/2015/11/20/springsteens_ties_that_bind_the_new_documentary_goes_deep_into_the_adult_concerns_that_fueled_the_river/http://brucespringsteen.net/news/2015/the- ties-that-bind-documentary-to-premiere-on-hbo by Thom Zimny and features an interview with Springsteen on writing and recording of The River. The film illustrates the music with solo acoustic guitar performances, period concert footage, and photos of Bruce and the band. The songs on The River reveal a tension between the need for community and the need to be alone. \\"The Ties That Bind\\", along with \\"Two Hearts\\" and \\"Out in the Street\\", is one of the key songs on the album about the need for community. Author Rob Kirkpatrick describes the song as \\"a challenge to a hurt woman not to forsake love but rather to accept the ties of relationships. It is a theme Springsteen would later reuse in his 1992 single \\"Human Touch.\\" Rolling Stone critic Paul Nelson cited the lyrics to \\"The Ties That Bind\\" as an example of \\"simple yet sturdy\\" lyrics that are \\"filled with an uncommon common sense and intelligence that could only have come from an exceptionally warmhearted but wary graduate of the street of hard knocks. It is a pulsing rocker that was influenced by Jackie De Shannon's \\"When You Walk in the Room\\", Creedence Clearwater Revival's \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\" and by The Searchers. The earliest known version of \\"The Ties That Bind\\" was performed as part of the soundcheck for a concert on September 20, 1978 at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, New Jersey. In that version, the theme was reversed from the ultimate version; rather than being about the need for community it was about the need to be alone and for escape. Music critic Clinton Heylin regards this version as being \\"magnificent,\\" \\"with a great pop hook set to a strong if undeveloped lyrical idea,\\" with lyrics such as \\"No one at my side/There's just a cold, dark highway and a thin white line/Which will lead me to the ties that bind.\\" By the time Springsteen began to perform it in concert in late autumn of 1978, the song had taken a form similar to its ultimate form, but Heylin regards the original version as being superior. \\"The Ties That Bind\\" has been a reasonably popular song in concert over the years, with about 200 performances through 2008.The Bruce Springsteen Setlist Page An encyclopedia about Bruce Springsteen took its name from the title of this song.

Polevoy was from an old merchant family from Kursk but was born in Irkutsk, where his father was director of a Russian-American company, and lived there until 1811, when the family moved first to Moscow and then to Kursk.Brockhaus and Efron, Krugosvet His father, disappointed in his refusal to take up the family business and disapproving of his interest in literature and history, refused to pay for his education, so he taught himself.Russkaya Fantastika In February 1820 he moved to Moscow, where he attended both the theater and lectures at Moscow University; he visited Saint Petersburg and met Alexander Griboyedov, Vasily Zhukovsky, Faddei Bulgarin, and other literary figures, and began a literary career, publishing articles, poems, and translations in the journals of the day. In 1825 he started his own journal, Moskovskii telegraf (The Moscow Telegraph), hoping to attract the writers he admired, like Pushkin, as well as emphasize the positive contributions of the merchant class to Russia. Unfortunately, the aristocrats of the Pushkin circle viewed him as a vulgar parvenu, and his attack on Karamzin's reactionary History of the Russian State offended many influential people, notably Pyotr Vyazemsky, who had been Karamzin's ward and whose sister was married to the older historian.Leighton, Russian Romantic Criticism, p. 106. When Polevoy wrote his own six-volume History of the Russian People (1829‚Äì1833), it was savaged by almost everyone. The brilliant and idiosyncratic critic Apollon Grigoryev wrote in his memoirs, \\"From our present [1864] point of view it would be impossible to conceive anything more indecent than the article that the editor of the Moscow Herald [i.e., Mikhail Pogodin] hurled against The History of the Russian People, if the articles [by Nikolai Nadezhdin] against it in the old men's European Herald had not been even more indecent... The factions do not seem to have been in their right minds thirty years ago. What was the cause of their being so hostile that they foamed at the mouth?\\"Grigoryev, My Literary and Moral Wanderings, p. 71. Polevoy emphasized that history followed laws and did not depend on the actions of particular individuals; he also was one of the first to present Russian history as a confrontation between Europe and Asia.RIN.ru article Lauren G. Leighton says, summing up the contributions of Nikolai and his brother and collaborator Ksenofont: > No one should argue that the Polevoys were comparable in literary taste and > talent to the aristocrats of the Pushkin pleiad; their self-educated, self- > made characters are apparent in their journal. But neither should they be > denied their great contribution in making leading European thinkers > available to the Russian public in Russian, their eminently human > liberalism, or their courage in constantly testing‚Äîand outwitting‚Äîthe > government censor. In 1834, after competition from both the aristocrats and > the plebeians had laid waste to the Polevoys' finances, The Moscow Telegraph > was closed down by the government. The Polevoys spent most of the rest of > their lives editing the journals of Bulgarin and Grech.Leighton, Russian > Romantic Criticism, p. 107. The journal was closed down because of a bad review it gave a play by Nestor Kukolnik; Bernard Pares tells the story: > It must be understood that the vast distances and the thinness of population > in Russia practically confined journalistic enterprise to St. Petersburg and > Moscow. Even the Moscow journalists were hampered, in comparison with those > of St. Petersburg, because it took them longer to guess in which direction > the wind of the moment was blowing.

He has appeared on Blue Heelers, Neighbours, Stingers and Good Morning Australia.  Early life  Alexander grew up in country Victoria, where he was raised on an isolated farm in the Victoria wheat-belt. At six years old, he discovered a box of old records belonging to his grandparents in an old shed. This included artists such as Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra and even Slim Dusty. One of the records was by Mario Lanza which he states triggered his lifelong love for operatic and classical singing. He studied and graduated from the Victorian College of the Arts in voice and drama, after which he paid his way by working in the jazz clubs of New York. After extensively working the New York jazz scene from 2000 to 2002, he returned to Australia.  Professional career  Alexander is considered best known for his lead roles that he has performed on the Australian stage. Some of his well-known roles are Bobby Strong in Melbourne Theatre Company's Urinetown, Claude in Hair, Willard in Footloose, Billy Crocker in Anything Goes, and the Scarecrow in the Sydney season of The Wizard Of Oz. He has also appeared in the 10th-anniversary production of Les Mis√©rables, South Pacific, Only Heaven Knows and Angry Penguins. Alexander has also toured Australia in concert with the Australian Philharmonic Orchestra. It was in 2000 that Kane took his cabaret show to New York. There he appeared at the FireBird Cafe and Algonquin Hotel's Oak Room. In the 2001 New York Cabaret Awards, he was named \\"Best New Voice\\" in the Theatermania Cabaret list, and won both the BISTRO and MAC Awards for \\"Most Outstanding Debut\\". Furthermore, he became \\"Critic's Pick\\" in the New York Post, and \\"Pick of the Week\\" in New York's Time Out Magazine for three consecutive weeks. Then in 2002, he was requested to perform alongside Natalie Cole at Rupert Murdoch's 70th-birthday party, hosted in New York. After his return to Australia, he was named a finalist in the Arts section of the 2001 Young Australian of the Year Awards, and nominated for a MO Award for his performance in Footloose. Kane also completed a tour with the Australian Philharmonic Orchestra, performing The Music of Lerner & Loewe at concert halls around Australia. Alexander has also made several television appearances, such as Good Morning Australia, Denise, The Midday Show, In Melbourne Tonight, Carols By Candlelight and The Good Friday Appeal Gala, along with roles in Late For School, Neighbours, Water Rats and Stingers. He also appeared as a guest performer on the 18 June 2006 special broadcast of The Footy Show which was filmed in Munich in which he performed the song \\"Timeless\\" with Australian icon Tina Arena. The show was specially broadcast in support of the Australian soccer team for the 2006 world cup.  Kane Alexander (debut album)  The concept for the album emerged from Kane's passion for pop, opera and the sweeping orchestration of the most memorable movie themes. \\"I wanted to make an album that moved people, with songs that told a story. I wanted to take the listener on a journey. But I wanted a cinematic sound. I wanted the orchestra to be scored the way a film score would be scored. This had to be an album that I wanted to listen to myself.\\" According to his Myspace page, Alexander has stated that he was happy that Sony BMG allowed him to spend three years capturing his vision for the album. This allowed him to get the right producer and sound for the record. The debut album was recorded in Stockholm and London, with the efforts of producers and songwriters such as Andes Bagge, Quiz & Larossi, Tom Nichols, Tim Baxter and Sigurd Rosnes as well as members of the Stockholm Symphony Orchestra (who appear on every track). Come Vivrei is an enchanting Italian adaption of Trisha Yearwood's Grammy award-winning song, \\"How Do I Live\\", whereas other classics included are the poetic \\"Kiss From A Rose\\" by Seal, and \\"Crying\\" by Roy Orbison, both reworked into baritone adaptions from their original versions. Much loved classics \\"Le Cose Che Sei Per Me\\", \\"Di Sole E D'Azzuro\\" and \\"Nella Fantasia\\" are also included. This album also contains the origin of the Tina Arena duet, with a studio version of the song \\"Timeless\\" that they subsequently performed for The Footy Show. Alexander professes that he never saw himself as a writer, yet contributed his song writing talents to co-writing two songs on the album, opener \\"Escape\\" and epilogue \\"Breathe\\". These were co-written with Andes Bagge and Tom Nichols. # \\"Escape\\" # \\"Come Vivrei (How Do I Live)\\" # \\"Timeless\\" (Duet with Tina Arena) # \\"Di Sole E D'Azzuro\\" # \\"Nella Fantasia\\" # \\"Everything That I am\\" # \\"Le Cose Che Sei Per Me (The Things You Are To Me)\\" # \\"Crying\\" # \\"Kiss from a Rose\\" # \\"Let It Rain\\" # \\"Breathe\\"  References   External links / References   http://www.icmi.com.au/kane-alexander * https://web.archive.org/web/20081217075021/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile * http://www.allegromusic.com.au/index.php?option=directory&task;=profile&lid;=117 Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Australian male television actors ","title":"Kane Alexander"},{"id":"16757254","text":"Asineops (Greek for \\"donkey-faced\\") is a genus of prehistoric fish from the Eocene.

It consists of the 800-block of the road Cedar Bough Place, between Beeler and Ekin Avenues. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. Description Twenty-five primary buildings, seven outbuildings, and one fence contribute to the historic nature of the neighborhood, all of which built from 1883 to 1920. These buildings are primarily of Vernacular Victorian and Queen Anne style, but examples of Bungalow, Airplane Bungalow and American Foursquare are also in the district. Most houses in the district were built between 1891 and 1905. History The district was originally part of owned by the Loughrey family in the early 19th century. The would be divided into twenty plots, with sizes ranging from two to . Lot #6 was , and would become Cedar Bough Place. When Lot 42 of the Illinois Land Grant was divided, Cedar Bough Place was laid off into lots, roads, etc. and sold on the 17th day of September, 1836 by Margaret Loughrey with the following provision: \\"and I hereby certify all roads, alleys, streets, etc., laid off of said ground to be for the common benefit of the purchasers and owners of said lots. The streets and alleys cannot be opened to the public without 90% of the property owners voting for the street being dedicated as a public street.\\" Private streets were created as a way for residential landowners to control real estate speculation and maintain property standards, in an era before the protections of zoning. South Entrance Construction in the neighborhood was started by Andros Huncilman 50 years later in 1890, at the end of the prosperous post- Civil War era in New Albany's history. Huncilman owned a lot that would comprise the district. Throughout its history it has been a private street; with ownership of the street divided among the property owners. By deed restriction, Cedar Bough Place is one of the first private streets in the United States. Lucas Place, the first private street in St. Louis, Missouri, was dedicated 15 years later, in 1851. That private street no longer exists. The oldest existing private street in St. Louis, Missouri is Lafayette Square, which dates to 1868, was dedicated 32 years after Cedar Bough Place was created and made private by Loughrey's deed restriction. No other city near New Albany, including Louisville, has private streets (although Louisville does have private alleys), and Cedar Bough Place is the only private street in New Albany. A long-standing fence that contributes to the historic nature of the neighborhood is on the north side, and is a central wrought iron connecting two original stone walls keeping traffic from entering the private road. The southern fence is just wide enough for a single vehicle. Built in 1970 to replace the original entrance, it is not part of the historic fabric of the district.

The station, established in 1949, is currently owned and operated by Fishback Media, Inc. WGGH broadcasts a mix of conservative talk and Christian talk to the greater Marion-Carbondale area. The station signed on an FM translator signal on 98.5 in May 2018. Programming WGGH airs a mix of local and syndicated news and talk programming with a conservative or religious bent. Notable weekday programming includes The Dennis Miller Show in late mornings, a block of local news and ministry programs in early afternoons, plus Focus on the Family and The Dave Ramsey Show in late afternoons. Weekend programming includes local sports, legal, and religious discussion programs, plus a variety of church services and more classic country music. WGGH also broadcasts the high school football games of the Marion Wildcats. History WGGH began daytime-only broadcast operations on September 24, 1949, with 500 watts of power under the ownership of general manager Hartley Grisham and chief engineer George W. Dodds, a partnership doing business as the Marion Broadcasting Company. Dodds bought out Grisham to become sole owner of the station in 1955. At the same time, Dodds relocated WGGH to its current broadcast facility and got authorization from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to increase the station's signal strength to 5,000 watts. In May 1991, station owner George W. Dodds, trading as Marion Broadcasting Company, reached an agreement to sell WGGH to Tri-State Christian TV, Inc. The FCC dismissed this application on January 13, 1992. In February 1992, Dodds reached a new sale agreement with Vine Broadcasting, Inc., and filed a new application with the FCC. The FCC approved the transfer of the broadcast license on April 7, 1992, and the transaction was formally consummated on June 9, 1992. After this sale and more than 40 years of station ownership, Dodds retired from broadcasting. He died in May 2005. Johnny and Elaine Gomez, owners of Vine Broadcasting, maintained the station's longtime religious broadcasting format. After 15 years of ownership, Vine Broadcasting agreed to sell WGGH to Fishback Media, Inc., in June 2007. The transfer gained FCC approval on August 28, 2007, and the transaction was consummated on September 17, 2007. New owner and Marion native Jimmy \\"Fish\\" Fishback retained the station's Southern Gospel format until switching to its current format on November 4, 2008. Fishback is a veteran broadcaster, voice artist, and syndicated radio host. His credits include promos for Showtime's Masters of Horror and providing the imaging voice of \\"V Rock\\" in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories. Longtime St. Louis television personality \\"Uncle Erv\\" Coppi got his start in broadcasting at WGGH. His on- air duties included spinning big band records to create the illusion of live concert broadcasts. Community involvement Each Christmas season, WGGH decorates its broadcast facilities with a computer-controlled light show and encourages visitors to donate canned good for a local food pantry or money for a nearby children's home. In addition to its regular programming, WGGH also serves the community by broadcasting high school homecoming parades, greetings to the troops, local high school sports, plus synchronized music for the town's Fourth of July fireworks show.

(In the UK and Europe, \\" The River\\" was released instead.) In the U.S., \\"Fade Away\\" was not as successful as the previous single from the album, \\"Hungry Heart\\", but still reached #20 on the U.S. pop singles chart. It was only performed sporadically on The River Tour,Killing Floor database: query and searches online and not at all for nearly the first two months. p. 147. The judgement behind its selection as the second single was questioned, considering the more radio-friendly songs on the record, and the choice was blamed for slowing down sales of the album. p. 153. It was then dropped from Springsteen's concert repertoire completely, only rematerializing for a handful of solo renditions on the 2005 Devils & Dust Tour. E Streeter Steve Van Zandt has proclaimed \\"Fade Away\\" as one of his favorite Springsteen songs, but thinks that it is not played in band shows because it is too slow. Regardless, he says, \\"It's just one of those funny, lost little gems, you know?\\" It was finally given an E Street Band performance again at Stockholms Stadion on June 7, 2009 during the European second leg of the Working on a Dream Tour; Springsteen made reference on stage to Van Zandt's desire to hear it. The song was performed once on the Wrecking Ball Tour on July 20, 2013 at King's Hall in Belfast; Springsteen made reference on stage that it was Van Zandt's favorite song.Bruce Base: Fade AwayYouTube: Fade Away, Belfast July 20, 2013 The song was played nightly during the North American leg of Springsteen's 2016 River Tour, where The River was played in its entirety. When the tour reached Europe, the album presentation format of the tour was dropped, with the exception of a few shows. \\"Fade Away\\" has not been performed outside of the album format. Meanwhile, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes (old Van Zandt cohorts) had added \\"Fade Away\\" to his concerts from the 1980s on, and it would be included on his 1997 Spittin' Fire live album. Southside's renditions have often been of a slow, bluesy nature, accompanied only by bandmate Bobby Bandiera. Track listing # Fade Away ‚Äì 4:46 # Be True ‚Äì 3:39 \\"Be True\\" is a track from The River sessions that continued the new Springsteen tradition of using songs that did not appear on his albums as B-sides. It was recorded on July 21, 1979, at The Power Station, in one of the first sessions for the album. According to Springsteen, \\"Be True\\" was left off The River album in favor of the song \\"Crush on You\\", a decision he has a hard time understanding in retrospect. Although left off the album and released only as a B-side of a single, \\"Be True\\" reached #42 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.

The described method will not protect against botulism. Home canning or bottling, also known colloquially as putting up or processing, is the process of preserving foods, in particular, fruits, vegetables, and meats, by packing them into glass jars and then heating the jars to create a vacuum seal and kill the organisms that would create spoilage. Safety While it is possible to safely preserve many kinds of foodstuffs, home canning can expose consumers to botulism and other kinds of food poisoning if done incorrectly. The most common source of food-borne botulism is home-canned foods prepared in an unsafe manner.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Botulism in the United States, 1899-1996. Handbook for Epidemiologists, Clinicians, and Laboratory Workers, Atlanta, GA. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1998. Safety measures must be taken when performing home canning, since ingestion of toxin in food produced by Clostridium botulinum can cause death., National Botulism Surveillance by CDC. Because of the high risk of illness or death associated with improper canning techniques, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) considers it critical that consumers who intend to can at home obtain proper and current information from a reliable source.Andress, E, Kuhn, G. (1998). Critical Review of Home Preservation Literature and Current Research. Athens, GA: University of Georgia, Cooperative Extension Service. Reprinted by the National Center for Home Food Preservation. At the basis of these recommendations is the balance between bringing the food to a high enough temperature for a long enough time that spoilage and disease-producing microorganisms are killed, while not heating the food so much that it loses nutritive value or palatability.  North America  Green beans in a pressure canner ready to be processed In North America, home canning is usually done in Mason jars, which have thicker walls than single-use commercial glass jars. Unless the food being preserved has a high acid content (pH <4.6) or salt or sugar content resulting in water availability <0.85, such as pickles or jellies, the filled jars are also processed under pressure in a canner, a specialized type of pressure cooker. Ordinary pressure cookers are not recommended for canning as their smaller size and the reduced thickness of the cooker wall will not allow for the correct building up and reducing time of pressure, which is factored into the overall processing time and therefore will not destroy all the harmful microorganisms.National Center for Home Food Preservation, Burning Issue: Canning in Pressure Cookers The goal in using a pressure canner is to achieve a \\"botulinum cook\\" of 121 ¬∞C for 3 minutes, throughout the entire volume of canned product. Canners often incorporate racks to hold Mason jars, and pressure canners are capable of achieving the elevated temperatures needed to prevent spoilage. The most common configuration is a Mason jar with a flat lid and screw ring. The lid is generally made of plated or painted steel, with an elastomeric washer or gasket bonded to the underside of the rim. The lid also incorporates a slightly dimpled shape, which acts as an indicator of the vacuum (or lack thereof) inside a sealed jar. A newer reusable lid is now available that uses a flat plastic disk with a reusable rubber gasket. The ring threads onto the top of the jar over the lid to hold it in place while the jar cools after processing; the ring can be removed once a vacuum has been established in the jar. Jars are commonly in either pint or quart capacities, with two opening diameters, known as \\"standard\\" and \\"wide mouth\\". When a jar has cooled and is properly sealed, pressing the dimple on the lid will not make any sound. An improperly sealed jar will allow the dimple to move up and down, sometimes making a popping noise. Lack of this noise does not necessarily indicate that the food in the jar is properly preserved. Typically, during the cooling process, a properly sealed lid will pop once as the pressure inside the jar is reduced enough that atmospheric pressure pushes the lid inward. Older variations had a ceramic seal inside a one-piece zinc lid. Another method that is no longer recommended was the use of layer of hot paraffin wax poured directly over the top of the food (especially jams and jellies) to seal it from air, thus reducing growth of aerobic microorganisms like mold.  United Kingdom  A Dixie Can Sealer for home use. Now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum. In the United Kingdom home bottling is done with Kilner jars in a similar way to the Mason jars in the US, and although old-style Kilner jars have a glass lid without a \\"dimple\\" more recent varieties do.Kilner Jars and PartsBottling or Canning Fruit and Vegetables Most home bottling is done using the \\"open kettle method\\", with hot food ladled into hot jars and lids placed on jars, with no water bath sterilization processing of the product afterward.  Australia  In Australia the most popular home canning system is Fowler's Vacola. This system uses glass jars, single use seals, metal lids, and a water bath canning sterilization process. During the canning process the lids are secured by metal tension clips which are removed once a vacuum seal has formed.Fowler's Method of Bottling Fruits and Vegetables, J. Fowler, 26th Edition Fowler's Vacola products are still produced and are available from some hardware stores. Used equipment is frequently sold on online auction sites and in opportunity shops.  Germany  Weck glass with rubber seal and steel tension clips. The red tongue showing downwards indicates an intact sealing In Germany the most popular home canning system is Weck jar. This system uses glass jars (80ml-2.5l) and glass bottles (200ml-1l), reusable rubber seals, glass lids, and a water bath canning sterilization process. During the canning process the lids are secured by steel tension clips which can be removed once a vacuum seal has formed. During storage the vertical position of the rubber seal's external tongue indicates the status of the sealing. Weck products are still produced and are available from German hardware stores. Used equipment is frequently sold on online auction sites and in opportunity shops. They can be used for water bath canning and pressure canning. For water bath canning use two steel tension clips and for pressure canning use three steel tension clips. Remove them after vacuum has formed.

The clade contains about one third of the world's modern species of vertebrates: over 14,000 species. A key anatomical innovation in acanthomorphs is hollow and unsegmented spines at the anterior edge of the dorsal and anal fins. A fish can extend these sharp bony spines to protect itself from predators, but can also retract them to decrease drag when swimming. Another shared feature is a particular rostral cartilage, associated with ligaments attached to the rostrum and premaxilla, that enables the fish to protrude its jaws considerably to catch food. Rosen coined the name in 1973 to describe a clade comprising Acanthopterygii, Paracanthopterygii, and also ctenothrissiform fossils from the Cretaceous Period, such as Aulolepis and Ctenothrissa. Those fossils share several details of the skeleton, and especially of the skull, with modern acanthomorphs. Originally based on anatomy, Acanthomorpha has been borne out by more recent molecular analyses. Phylogeny The phylogeny of living bony fishes  Fossil record and evolutionary history  Some otoliths, calcium carbonate structures that form the ears of fishes, have been found from the Jurassic Period that may belong to acanthomorphs, but the oldest body fossils from this taxon are only known from the middle of the Cretaceous Period, about 100 million years ago. Acanthomorphs from the early Late Cretaceous were small, typically about 4 centimeters long, and fairly rare. Toward the beginning of the Cenozoic era, they exploded in an adaptive radiation, so by the time their fossils begin appear more frequently in Eocene-aged strata, they had reached their modern diversity of 300 families. Recently discovered fish scales from Poland suggest that the oldest acanthomorphs occurred on Late Triassic. Some examples of extinct acanthomorph genera include: *Asineops *Congorhynchus *Blochius *Enniskillenus *Homorhynchus *Omosomopsis *Palaeorhynchus *Pharmacichthys *Pseudotetrapterus Timeline of genera ImageSize = width:1500px height:auto barincrement:15px PlotArea = left:10px bottom:50px top:10px right:10px Period = from:-145.5 till:0 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:10 start:-145.5 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:-145.5 TimeAxis = orientation:hor AlignBars = justify Colors = #legends id:CAR value:claret id:ANK value:rgb(0.4,0.3,0.196) id:HER value:teal id:HAD value:green id:OMN value:blue id:black value:black id:white value:white id:cretaceous value:rgb(0.5,0.78,0.31) id:earlycretaceous value:rgb(0.63,0.78,0.65) id:latecretaceous value:rgb(0.74,0.82,0.37) id:cenozoic value:rgb(0.54,0.54,0.258) id:paleogene value:rgb(0.99,0.6,0.32) id:paleocene value:rgb(0.99,0.65,0.37) id:eocene value:rgb(0.99,0.71,0.42) id:oligocene value:rgb(0.99,0.75,0.48) id:neogene value:rgb(0.999999,0.9,0.1) id:miocene value:rgb(0.999999,0.999999,0) id:pliocene value:rgb(0.97,0.98,0.68) id:quaternary value:rgb(0.98,0.98,0.5) id:pleistocene value:rgb(0.999999,0.95,0.68) id:holocene value:rgb(0.999,0.95,0.88) BarData= bar:eratop bar:space bar:periodtop bar:space bar:NAM1 bar:NAM2 bar:NAM3 bar:NAM4 bar:NAM5 bar:NAM6 bar:NAM7 bar:NAM8 bar:NAM9 bar:NAM10 bar:space bar:period bar:space bar:era PlotData= align:center textcolor:black fontsize:M mark:(line,black) width:25 shift:(7,-4) bar:periodtop from: -145.5 till: -99.6 color:earlycretaceous text:Early from: -99.6 till: -66 color:latecretaceous text:Late from: -66 till: -55.8 color:paleocene text:Paleo. from: -55.8 till: -33.9 color:eocene text:Eo. from: -33.9 till: -23.03 color:oligocene text:Oligo. from: -23.03 till: -5.332 color:miocene text:Mio. from: -5.332 till: -2.588 color:pliocene text:Pl. from: -2.588 till: -0.0117 color:pleistocene text:Pl. from: -0.0117 till: 0 color:holocene text:H. bar:eratop from: -145.5 till: -66 color:cretaceous text:Cretaceous from: -66 till: -23.03 color:paleogene text:Paleogene from: -23.03 till: -2.588 color:neogene text:Neogene from: -2.588 till: 0 color:quaternary text:Q.

This led to the peasantry seizing the Tres Hijuelas farm. Mapuche families from the neighboring Reducci√≥n Alhueco quietly threaded their way across the wheat fields of Caut√≠n Province in southern Chile to pitch crude tents of wheat sacks and old blankets under a hillside cluster of eucalyptus trees on the farm with which they had a boundary dispute lasting many years. The Mapuches posted guards at the deserted clapboard farmhouse of the Fundo Tres Hijuelas- the Owner, Carlos Taladriz, lived in the neighboring town of Lautaro and was away in Santiago at the time-as well as at the machine shed, at the roadside entrance to the farm and at the bridge of planks that crossed over a small stream to the house. The only persons living on the farm at the time were a shepherd and a tractor driver. The Mapuches, following what seemed to be a carefully prepared course of actions, decorated the house around the farm's main facility with red and black banners of the Castroite MIR (Movement of the Revolutionary Left) and of its peasant affiliate, Movimiento Campesino Revolucionario (MCR). On the next morning the provincial newspaper, El Diario Austral, printed a front-page photograph of the Mapuches, armed with thin short sticks and pitchforks, gathered at the entrance to the farm, which had been barred with poles that came from tall trees that bore a glowering portrait of Che Guevara. Above their heads a large banner was tied to the gateposts that read: CAPAMENTO LAUTARO. TIERRA O MUERTE. VENCEREMOS. MOVIMIENTO CAMPESINO REVOLUCIONARIO. The newspaper reported \\"total intransigence\\" on the part of the Indians, who claimed that the lands were stolen from their community in the past and insisted upon remaining on the farm until it was repossessed by the Agrarian Reform Corporation (CORA). This is significant because in 1971 and 1972 some 120 farms were repossessed in this manner. Also it shows the desperate need that Chile was in which is why in 1970 to 1973 they attempted to repair the economy with Marxism. One of the major factors in the extreme poverty in Chile was because while the production of food per acre increased 20%, the population increased by nearly 80%. The rural poor was forced to feed the 76% urban population. However, whatever comfort the Marxist government could offer was quickly withdrawn as less than three years later, in 1973 a dictatorship government was installed.

Pineault was drafted 46th overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Pineault originally was a product of the U.S National Development Program. He then played collegiate hockey in 2003‚Äì04 with Boston College before moving on to the Moncton Wildcats of the QMJHL. Pineault made his professional debut in the 2006‚Äì07 season with the Blue Jackets affiliate, Syracuse Crunch. Pineault made his NHL debut in the 2007‚Äì08 season on April 3, 2008, against the Detroit Red Wings. On January 10, 2009, Pineault was traded by the Blue Jackets to the Chicago Blackhawks for Michael Blunden. He was then assigned to the Rockford IceHogs of the American Hockey League for the remainder of the 2008‚Äì09 season. Pineault left for Europe and signed during the 2009‚Äì10 season to trial with HC in the Czech Extraliga on November 2, 2009. After appearing in ten games with Pardubice, Pineault established himself offensively and was offered a contract to remain on the team on December 8, 2009. Adding a physical presence and scoring 10 goals and 20 points in 31 games as a role player, Pineault was given an extended multi-year contract to stay in the Czech Republic on May 14, 2010. After resuming his career in North America, with a tenure in the Central Hockey League with the Allen Americans, Pineault signed a one-year contract as a free agent with the Utah Grizzlies of the ECHL on August 28, 2013. At the completion of the 2013‚Äì14 season with the Grizzlies, after suffering from a Jaw injury for a significant portion of the year, Pineault opted to end his eight-year professional career and retire. Personal Pineault took 2011 away from hockey to be with his wife, Monique Pineault who was battling Leukemia at the time. After his wife went into remission he continued playing hockey for the Allen Americans, but only played in 3 games before returning to be with his wife. Upon retirement, Pinealt opted for a career in pharmaceutical sales, driven by his wife Monique's battle with acute myeloid leukemia.

He was the younger brother of Buddy Guy. Biography Guy was born in Lettsworth, Louisiana. He played with the harmonica player Raful Neal for ten years in the Baton Rouge area. He then relocated to Chicago in 1969, where he joined his brother's band, at the time when his brother was becoming known as an innovator in blues guitar. The brothers collaborated extensively with Junior Wells in the 1970s. Guy recorded a number of albums under his own name in the 1980s and 1990s, branching out into soul and funk. He can be seen in his self-described hippie phase in the film Festival Express, in which the Guy band tours southern Canada by train in 1970 with the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin and the Band. Guy worked with Maurice John Vaughn in 1979, notably converting him into a blues musician. Guy died of prostate cancer on August 20, 2008, in Chicago Heights, Illinois, just a few months after diagnosis of the disease.

He received critical acclaim before he and his bandmates Alberto Mangili and Lee Citron were killed in a car accident. The charity Anno's Africa was founded in his name. Relations Birkin's father is Andrew Birkin, his mother Bee Gilbert, brother Ned Birkin, his half- siblings David Birkin, Melissa Holm and Barnaby Holm, his aunt Jane Birkin, and his cousins Kate Barry, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Lou Doillon. His grandparents on his father's side were Judy Campbell and Lt Cdr David Birkin.  Childhood  Birkin named himself Anno when he was three, after his favourite book, Anno's Journey by Mitsumasa Anno. When he was five, his parents bought an old farmhouse on the Lleyn peninsula in Wales, and it was here that Birkin and his brother Ned spent most of their childhood, \\"living what friends describe as a Bohemian lifestyle where the house was forever full of friends\\".  Music  Birkin aged 17 Birkin's first band, called Midstream, formed in 1994 with his school-friends Billy Scherer and JS Rafaeli, gigged in London until 1996 when it split up. Durango 95 was put together that same year, but split up in 1997. For the next two years, Birkin composed and played on his own as well as worked with Scherer. While visiting his father on the film set of The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc in 1998, Birkin fell in love with the actress Milla Jovovich. Anno and Milla wrote and recorded a number of songs together. She later wrote, \\"I remember the absolute wonder I felt when he first wrote to me. I was bowled over by his choices, his words.\\" His fianc√©e Honeysuckle Weeks wrote, \\"I think what Anno was doing in his writing as well as in life was trying to separate the pure from the sordid. Like a lot of teenage boys, he felt guilty about his own desires and he tried to elevate them through poetry.\\" During the summer of 1999, Birkin wrote and recorded a number of songs, both solo and with Scherer; the two wrote Ultraviolence together, that led to a recording offer from Virgin. They turned it down and in August formed Flying Mango Attack with bassist Lee Citron and drummer Sh√Øan Smith-Pancorvo (both formerly of Stony Sleep) and recorded the album Karmageddon. They briefly broke up after various drummers came and went, and once again Birkin and Scherer spent time recording together in Los Angeles. In September 2000, Birkin, Scherer, and Citron met the Italian drummer Alberto Mangili and formed Kicks joy Darkness (\\"KjD\\", named after a quote from Jack Kerouac's On the Road).\\"At lilac evening I walked with every muscle aching among the lights of 27th and Welton in the Denver coloured section, wishing I were a Negro, feeling that the best the white world had offered was not enough ecstasy for me, not enough life, joy, kicks, darkness, music, not enough night.\\" KjD began performing in late 2000 and in December, recorded an EP Ark, produced in Birkin's Welsh studio. The following spring, he travelled around India with his brother David Birkin, writing poetry and songs. He returned to England in April and embarked on a series of gigs with KjD, quickly building up a keen following on the London circuit. The band decided to record Method One, their first studio album, in Bergamo, where Mangili had a recording studio. They played their farewell gig at the Dublin Castle in London before heading to Italy at the end of August. Birkin wrote to Weeks, \\"Everything has fallen into place around my skull thanks to this opportunity [of recording in Italy]. For the first time in my life I feel like I know what I'm doing, and I'm doing what I know. The fear and anxiety and excitement I'm feeling at the moment is bursting me.\\"Birkin, Anno. (30 August 2001). Letter to Honeysuckle Weeks.  Death  On 8 November 2001, after the band had spent the day rehearsing, Birkin, Citron, and Mangili were killed in an early-morning car crash on the outskirts of Milan. Birkin was a month and a day short of his 21st birthday.  Legacy  Birkin had created a website for the band in August 2001. Following his death, the site has provided a forum for his friends and fans. In 2003, Dreams of Waking ‚Äì a 2-CD album of songs by Birkin and KjD ‚Äì was released. Rock Sound called it an \\"art-rock adventure with hints of early Radiohead and Sonic Youth. ‚Ä¶ Anno's lyrics are poetic masterpieces in their own right.\\"Victoria Durham, Rock Sound, August 2003 Later that year, a selection of Birkin's poetry ‚Äì Who Said the Race Is Over? ‚Äì was published and sold over 4,000 copies. Tom Payne reviewed it in the Daily Telegraph as \\"this proud, fresh Romanticism. ‚Ä¶ Yet for all their brilliance, the poems feel unfinished. It is not just that the words have been left behind as a kind of consolation to those who mourn the author; it is as though they are still going about their tasks, asking the same questions and insolently refusing to settle.\\"Tom Payne, The Daily Telegraph, 21 February 2004 The poet Robert Anthony Welch (Dean of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Ulster) wrote, \\"Anno Birkin's book is utterly devastating. This is a great creative energy, with the authority and force of Rimbaud and the same quality of total honesty. And yet there is nothing mawkish about the whole thing, because the fire of relentless self-interrogation flames continually, purifying the emotion. So what you get is not something raw, but something highly tempered, like Toledo steel. Energetic, flashing, devastating.\\"Prof. Robert Welsh, Review Page, www.kicksjoydarkness.co.uk, 21 July 2006 Another Magazine published a selection of Birkin's poetry in 2005, commenting that \\"perhaps it is Withnail & I's writer and director Bruce Robinson who offers us the best description of the sheer assault of Birkin's talent. He writes in his introduction to the collection, 'Anno didn't need death to be brilliant. ‚Ä¶ I love his rage, and truth, and he touches me like I was still young. Anno too is a great poet, a teenage poet, and we can only be amazed by what he could do with half a yard of ink.'\\"Another Magazine, Winter 2005 Birkin was one of the two subjects of a BBC Radio 4 documentary, The Lost Boys, broadcast in September 2006.The Lost Boys, BBC Radio 4, 13 September 2006 Rachel Davies of Esben and the Witch has cited Birkin's poetry as an influence on her own lyrics.  Anno's Africa  With the profits of Birkin's words and music, his parents initiated Anno's Africa, an alternative arts-based charity for Kenyan orphans and slum children, with the aim of giving them a chance to express themselves creatively. His mother Bee Gilbert ran a pilot programme in the spring of 2007, to teach art, music, dance, drama, film, and acrobatics. The Telegraph Magazine published a five-page account of the pilot in September 2007,Reaching for the Stars, The Daily Telegraph Magazine, 15 September 2007. and an exhibition of the children's art work was held in London which featured over 200 paintings and monoprints. The event was hosted by Joanna Lumley and Ian Holm, and helped raise funds for the next project which was carried out in South Africa during March and April 2008. The Anno's Africa team returned to Kenya every year since then to carry out further arts workshops, which were the subject of a CNN special feature on 11 April 2011. Other trustees of the charity include actress Hayley Mills, artist Sarah Hamilton and screenwriter Emma Frost. A school sponsored by Anno's Africa was depicted in the second season of the Netflix TV series Sense8.

The Piarist Church (, also known as the Jesuit Church (Biserica Iezui»õilor) or the University Church (Biserica UniversitƒÉ»õii); ), located at 5 Str. UniversitƒÉ»õii, Cluj-Napoca, Romania, and dedicated to the Holy Trinity, was the first Roman Catholic church built in Transylvania after the Protestant Reformation, as well as the province's first Baroque church building. Among the city's more notable edifices, it served as a prototype for numerous other churches in Transylvania. It features a strong contrast between the sober exterior and a very well-decorated, almost exuberant interior. A statue of the Virgin Mary stood in front of the church until 1959, when the Communist authorities moved it to another part of the city. History Main fa√ßade, frontal view. On 13 March 1718, Jesuit priests began a fundraising campaign in order to build the church. Bishop Georgius Martonfi laid the cornerstone; the church was completed in 1724 and consecrated the following year by Bishop Joannes Antalfi. The Jesuits were suppressed in 1773 by Pope Clement XIV, so in 1776 Empress Maria Theresa transferred the church to the Piarists. The church's interior. The church was restored in 1775, 1831, 1943, 1970 and 2005-6. On 12 August 1956, priests and some 5,000 lay members of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church (who appeared on very short notice) organised a protest before the church. Its purpose was to demonstrate that their church, banned in 1948, had not ceased to exist, as the regime claimed. Initially they attempted to enter the church and hold mass, but the Roman Catholic priests did not allow them inside for fear of reprisals. Thus an open-air mass was held in front of the church; Fr. Vasile Chindri»ô in his sermon openly criticised the Communist leadership before masses of worshipers. Every priest who officiated at the liturgy was later arrested and imprisoned. Among the lay persons punished was Vasile FƒÉrca»ô, president of the Cluj Tribunal in the interwar period, who served nearly 8 years of a ten-year sentence, and his wife Eugenia. Description The church has two clock towers, each 45 m high. There are three narrow vertical windows above the entrance, meant to help illuminate the interior. The main door is surrounded by rich ornamentation; above it there is a bas-relief of the Trinity with the Latin inscription Honori Sanctissimae Trinitatis (\\"In Honour of the Most Holy Trinity\\"). There are two smaller doors to the left and the right of this one; above each of them is a sculpture of a saint resting in a niche - Ignatius of Loyola and Francis Xavier, works of the Bavarian artist Johannes K√∂nig. Previously, statues of saints John of Nepomuk and Aloysius Gonzaga, also by K√∂nig, stood near the side entrances. In contrast to the simple exterior, the interior is lavishly ornamented. The building has a single nave, 45 m long and 24 m high. There are three chapels on the sides, each with its own altar and adorned with several paintings. On the walls are to be found the devotional plaques common to Roman Catholic churches, written in Transylvania's main historical languages: Romanian, Hungarian, German and Latin. The main altar near the choir is grandiose. On the upper part is the Latin inscription Magno Deo uni ac trino laus virtus gloria (\\"To the one and triune great God praise, honour and glory\\"), between two angels. The altar is dedicated to the Trinity. Upon it rests an icon of the Virgin Mary, painted on wood and framed in metal; a number of people reported that it shed tears over a two-week period in 1699. This may be the original wonder-working icon from Nicula. Below it are two statues of Jesuit saints, Francis and Ignatius, brought from Vienna in 1726. The pulpit, the work of Anton Schuchbauer, is decorated on the outside with relief carvings of the Four Evangelists, and in between the pulpit and its crown there is a bas-relief with the most important Jesuit saints. Saint Michael is depicted on the pulpit's crown. Underneath the church building there is a crypt with 140 graves.

The title track of his fifth album, it was a hit single in parts of Europe in 1981; it reached No. 25 in the Netherlands, and the top 10 in both Sweden and Norway. Its B-side was either \\"Independence Day\\" or \\"Ramrod\\", depending on the country of release. Composition \\"The River\\" was originally intended to be included on an earlier, one-record version of The River, tentatively called The Ties That Bind. The song itself was recorded at The Power Station in New York City in July or August 1979.Brucebase, On The Tracks: The River In the first live performance of the song in 1979, Springsteen cited the inspiration as \\"my brother-in-law and my sister\\". The 2012 biography Bruce by Peter Ames Carlin includes an interview with Springsteen's sister Ginny, in which she plainly states that the song is a precise description of her early life with her husband Mickey, to whom she is still married today. In his 2016 autobiography Springsteen confirmed that he wrote the song as a tribute to his sister and his brother-in-law. \\"The River\\" makes use of a haunting harmonica part, and in some ways is a foreshadowing of the style of his next album, Nebraska. The imagery of the chorus and the end of the song were inspired by lines from Hank Williams' 1950 hit \\"Long Gone Lonesome Blues\\". p. 30 The song's depiction of how economic difficulties are interlaced with local culture also presaged the 1980s popularity of heartland rock: Writer Robert Hilburn described the song as \\"a classic outline of someone who has to re-adjust his dreams quickly [, facing] life as it is, not a world of his imagination.\\" Throughout the song the river is viewed as a symbol for the dreams of the future. The narrator keeps his hopes alive even as they realistically begin to fail. In 2015, Springsteen stated that he regards \\"The River\\", \\"Point Blank\\", \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Stolen Car\\" as being \\"the heart and soul\\" of The River album. \\"The River\\", and a few other songs on the album such as \\"Wreck on the Highway\\" and \\"Stolen Car\\", are said to mark a new direction in his songwriting: these ballads imbued with a sense of hopelessness anticipate his next album, Nebraska. Springsteen himself has noted that \\"Wreck on the Highway\\" is one of the songs reflecting a shift in his songwriting style, linking The River to Nebraska. p. 255 Release and reception \\"The River\\" was not released as a single in the U.S., but it was released as a single in May 1981 in several countries in western Europe.Killing floor Bruce Springsteen discography It placed number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. It also reached number 24 on the Irish Singles Chart, number 10 in Sweden's singles chart, number 6 in the Danish Top 20 and had its best showing with a number 5 placement on Norway's singles chart. In the U.S., it gained considerable album-oriented rock airplay and became one of Springsteen's best-known songs. It was included on both his 1995 Greatest Hits and 2003 The Essential Bruce Springsteen compilations. The song was also incorporated in the European edition of the 2009 Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band Greatest Hits. The aggregation of critics' lists at Acclaimed Music rated this song as the #13 song of 1980, as well as #114 of the 1980s and #800 all time. Live performance history The song was debuted in public at the Musicians United for Safe Energy concerts at Madison Square Garden in September 1979, and was featured in the subsequent 1980 film No Nukes three months before The River's release. During the River Tour of 1980‚Äì81, the song was frequently preceded by a piano rendition of the theme from Once Upon a Time in the West, with a similar outro segueing into the following song. \\"The River\\" became a centerpiece of shows on some Springsteen tours. During the 1984‚Äì85 Born in the U.S.A. Tour, it was often preceded by a long, intense story from Springsteen about his battles with his father growing up, that would sometimes conclude positively and sometimes not; the silence after the story would then be interrupted by the start of the harmonica part. One such story and performance, that also touched on the Vietnam War, was included on the 1986 Live/1975‚Äì85 set. On later tours, especially in Europe, the song's outro was extended to great length, with audiences mass singing the wordless \\"oooh\\" parts at the end. On the 1999‚Äì2000 Reunion Tour, \\"The River\\" was cast in a different arrangement that featured a Clarence Clemons saxophone part; one such rendition was included on the subsequent Live in New York City album and DVD. The song has been performed about 626 times through early 2016.

The mall opened in 1972 with 600,000 square feet, and featured 60 stores, restaurants, and other services. Today Northpark mall is 1,080,000 square feet, and features more than 100 inline tenants, including a food court and eight anchor stores, JCPenney, two Macy's locations, Dunham's Sports, TJ Maxx, Vintage Stock, Jo-Ann Fabrics and Crafts, and H&M.; Northpark Mall is the largest mall in the Joplin region and serves a trade area of nearly 500,000 people. Freeman hospital added a soft play area in the Macy's women's court in the summer of 2014. The mall was also the temporary home of the 11th and 12th grades of Joplin High School until August 2014, when the new high school was completed. Northpark Mall is managed by CBL & Associates Properties. History Northpark Mall opened in 1972, on Range Line Road on the east side of Joplin. At the time, the mall was anchored by Montgomery Ward to the north, JCPenney to the south, and local chain Newman's the middle. Other stores included Walgreens, McCrory's, Ramsay's department store, For All Bible (which moved out in 2016, and permanently closed the next year), Wyatts cafeteria, as well as many other stores. Newman's became Heer's in 1987, the same year that a new wing was built, and the mall received its first renovation. The new wing extended easterly from the JCPenney store. This new wing included two new anchors, Famous-Barr and Venture. The renovation also brought a food court as well as a new 5 screen cinema. In 1994, Heer's closed, and Famous-Barr moved its men's wear and home goods to the former Heer's space. That same year Sears built a store adjacent to Montgomery Ward, moving from an older store near downtown Joplin. In 1998 the mall received a minor renovation, changing only the color scheme. After the closure of the Venture chain in 1998, its anchor at the mall was converted to Shopko, but it closed in the early 2000s following the closure of Montgomery Ward in 2001. Both Famous-Barr locations were re-branded as Macy's in 2006. Montgomery Ward remained vacant until mid-2007, when its space was split between TJ Maxx and Steve & Barry's, the latter of which closed in 2008 and was replaced by Vintage Stock. In 2006 the mall received its first major renovation in nearly 20 years, changing the color scheme, adding all new lighting and floor tiles, and renovating the food court to a route 66 theme. In 2012, Old Navy moved into a space formerly occupied by Tilt. As a result, the original Old Navy became Jo-Ann Fabrics, and Tilt opened a larger location near Vintage Stock, and Ulta Beauty opened a store off the food court. In the summer of 2014 a soft play area for children was added in the Macy's women's court.http://www.joplinglobe.com/local/x983003174/Wally-Kenndy-Bigger-better- Tilt-returns-to-mall In August 2015 mall management announced that the former Venture was being converted back to retail use. That work was completed by late September 2015. Joplin High School used the building as a temporary school until May 2014. In October 2015 Macy's moved the children's department to the men's store and men's moved over to the women's store. Both Macy's stores are also receiving a much needed makeover, including new fixtures, fresh paint, and new carpet. For-All Bible announced in December 2015 that they would be moving to a new location out of the mall. For-All Bible was one of the last original tenants, until they permanently closed in 2017, leaving JCPenney as the only remaining original tenant in the mall. Mall management announced in May 2016 that Dunham's Sports will be opening in the former Venture anchor. The store is currently working on renovations and plans to be open by fall 2016. With the opening of Dunham's the mall will have all of the anchor spaces full for the first time in 15 years. In November 2017 Swedish retailer H&M; opened their first store in southwest Missouri. On November 7, 2019, it was announced that Sears would be closing this location a part of a plan to close 96 stores nationwide. The store permanently closed in February 2020. Joplin High School Following the 2011 Joplin tornado which destroyed Joplin High School, officials said juniors and seniors in the 2011-12 class (and possibly later) would attend classes in a section of the mall. Classes began in the renovated former Shopko location on August 17, 2011. Joplin High School moved into their new building in August 2014.

Unusually for a Jewish cemetery, these include sculpted human figures and elaborate mausoleums in a variety of styles, most notably several mausoleums in the art nouveau or Jugendstil style. Kozma Street Cemetery was opened in 1891 by the Neolog Jewish community of Budapest. It is the largest Jewish cemetery of Budapest as well as being one of the biggest of Europe. During its history it has been the burial place of more than 300,000 people. It still serves the Hungarian Jewish community, which is the third largest in Europe.Kozma str.

He served as Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the Army's professional head, from 1963 until 1966, and as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CCOSC), forerunner of the role of Australia's Chief of the Defence Force, from 1966 until 1970. His eight-year tenure as senior officer of first the Army and then the Australian military spanned almost the entire period of the nation's involvement in the Vietnam War. Born in Sydney, Wilton entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1927. Owing to lack of opportunity in the Australian military at the time, he took a commission in the British Army following his graduation in 1930. He spent most of the remainder of the decade with the Royal Artillery in India. Wilton returned to Australia on the eve of World War II and was commissioned into the Royal Australian Artillery. He saw action with the 7th Division in Syria and the 3rd Division in New Guinea, earning a mention in despatches in the former campaign and the Distinguished Service Order in the latter. Finishing the war a temporary colonel, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1947. Wilton was posted to Korea in 1953 to take command of the 28th Commonwealth Brigade, leading it in its final action of the war in July. He was raised to Commander of the Order of the British Empire and awarded the US Legion of Merit for his performance in Korea. Wilton was promoted to major general in 1957 and became Commandant of Duntroon. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1962 and made CGS the following January, with the rank of lieutenant general. As CGS he oversaw a reorganisation of the Army's divisional structure, the reintroduction of conscription, and deployments during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia Konfrontasi and the Vietnam War. Knighted in 1964, he handed over the position of CGS in May 1966 and was appointed CCOSC. In this role he had overall responsibility for Australia's forces in Vietnam, and worked to achieve an integrated defence organisation, including a tri-services academy, a joint intelligence group, and the amalgamation of separate government departments for the Army, Navy and Air Force. Wilton was promoted to general in September 1968, and retired from the military in November 1970. He served as Consul-General in New York City from 1973 to 1975, and died in 1981, aged seventy. Early career John Wilton was born in Sydney on 22 November 1910, the second of two sons to English migrants Noel and Muriel Wilton. Noel was an electrical engineer, and moved with his family to Hobart in 1915 to take up employment with the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Department.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 1‚Äì3 Attending various schools, John and his brother Maurice lived in Sydney for a time with Muriel following their parents' separation in 1917, before Noel brought them back to Hobart in 1921.Horner, Strategic Command, p. 5 In 1923 he moved with them to Grafton, New South Wales, where he managed the Clarence River County Council.Horner, Strategic Command, p. 7 John attended Grafton High School, where he attained his leaving certificate.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 8‚Äì10 Considered by family to be a \\"loner\\", \\"a clear thinker\\", and a \\"quite, determined, achiever\\", he entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in February 1927, aged sixteen.McNeill, \\"General Sir John Wilton\\", pp. 318‚Äì319 Early on he was subjected to the usual bastardisation handed out to younger cadets by seniors, but was not known to inflict the same treatment on juniors once he reached the senior class. Although somewhat aloof from his fellows, he did well in team sports such as rugby and hockey, as well as swimming and diving. Second academically in his class of twelve, Wilton graduated from Duntroon on 9 December 1930. By 1930, the effects of the Great Depression had reduced the opportunities for Duntroon graduates. Only four of Wilton's classmates joined the Australian Military Forces, while four transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and four to the British Army. Wilton was among the last-mentioned, taking a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, with seniority from 22 November 1930. Seeking active duty, he requested a posting to India, and sailed with the 6th Field Brigade to Bombay in November 1931.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 27‚Äì28 He spent the next three years based at Fyzabad, near the Nepalese border. Promoted to lieutenant on 31 December 1933, he undertook training and exercises with his battery, and learned to speak Urdu, but saw no action.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 29, 33‚Äì35 In February 1935 he was posted to Burma, joining the 10th (Abbottabad) Battery of the Indian Mountain Artillery at Maymyo, near Mandalay.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 36‚Äì38 According to biographer David Horner, Wilton's \\"first taste of excitement\\" was in April 1935, when he joined the hunt for a rogue tiger and shot the animal as it attacked and mauled one of his companions.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 39‚Äì40 In November he saw operational service with his unit in skirmishes with local tribesmen in the Wa State of northern Burma, on the Chinese border.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 40‚Äì43 After eight months extended leave in 1936, and a posting to the Indian Army Ordnance Corps on 6 April 1938, Wilton briefly returned to Australia to marry Helen Marshall on 9 July 1938 at St. Andrew's Church in Summer Hill, New South Wales.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 45‚Äì49 John had met Helen, then a nurse, on a double date in Sydney while he was in his last year at Duntroon; the couple had two sons and a daughter.Horner, Strategic Command, p. 20 On the same trip home he was invited to transfer to the Australian military, and accepted. Promoted to captain on 31 December 1938, Wilton saw out his British service with a coastal battery in Karachi, and was commissioned into the Royal Australian Artillery on 26 May 1939. His service with the British Army in India and Burma had afforded him regimental experience that he could never have gained in Australia, as well as an understanding of mountainous and tropical conditions that would benefit him in years to come.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 36, 47 World War II alt=Seven men in military fatigues using radios and megaphones Wilton spent a year in coastal artillery posts at North Head and Port Kembla before transferring to the Second Australian Imperial Force.McNeill, \\"General Sir John Wilton\\", pp. 319‚Äì321 He was promoted major on 7 May 1940 and given command of a battery in the 2/4th Field Regiment, part of the recently formed 7th Division, which embarked for the Middle East in October.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 55‚Äì57 On the voyage he wrote his wife a letter in case he was killed, admonishing: \\"Remember what has always been our motto‚Äînothing can defeat us‚Äînot even death!\\"Horner, Strategic Command, p. 58 Appointed the division's Brigade Major Royal Artillery on 19 March 1941, Wilton served under Brigadier Frank Berryman in the Syrian campaign, and was responsible for coordinating operations during the Battle of Merdjayoun in June.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 60, 66‚Äì67 Assigned to the staff of Headquarters I Corps, Wilton became General Staff Officer Grade 2 (Artillery) on 1 November; this would be the final artillery posting of his career.Dennis et al., Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, pp. 603‚Äì604Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 69‚Äì70 He was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel on 25 November. On 30 December, Wilton was mentioned in despatches for his service with the 7th Division. He entered the Middle East Staff School at Haifa in January 1942, and graduated in May.Horner, Strategic Command, p. 71 Returning to Australia, Wilton became General Staff Officer Grade 1 in Major General Stanley Savige's 3rd Division in August 1942. Savige later recalled that \\"I never had a more competent staff, nor such a co-operative team, than that staff after Wilton came along.\\"Keating, The Right Man for the Right Job, p. 87 The 3rd Division was part of Lieutenant General Edmund Herring's II Corps. In October, Herring succeeded Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell as commander of New Guinea Force, and Savige became acting corps commander. With his attention focused on the corps, Savige relied on Wilton to supervise the training of the 3rd Division.Keating, The Right Man for the Right Job, pp. 86‚Äì89 Wilton travelled to New Guinea in February 1943 to reconnoitre the terrain and begin plans for the division's forthcoming campaign in Salamaua. He was attached to Kanga Force in Wau during March 1943, prior to its absorption by 3rd Division the following month.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 26 Herring had ordered that the 3rd Division \\"threaten\\" Salamaua, and despite Wilton's attempts to clarify precisely what this meant, the order remained vague. Savige and Wilton interpreted it as meaning that the 3rd Division was to capture Salamaua, when in fact its main purpose in the campaign was to divert Japanese forces from Lae.Horner, Strategic Command, p. 96 In any event, 3rd Division progressed steadily and by August it had to be ordered to slow down so that Lae could be attacked before Salamaua.Horner, Strategic Command, p. 111 Wilton received much of the credit for 3rd Division's performance.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 112‚Äì113 He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his \\"skill and ability in New Guinea\\" between July 1942 and April 1943, the citation being promulgated on 27 April 1944. In September 1943, following his service with 3rd Division, Wilton was posted to Washington, D.C. as General Staff Officer, Australian Military Mission; he spent November and December 1944 in Europe, observing the Allies' military organisation. He was promoted temporary colonel in May 1945, and spent the remainder of the war on the staff of General Sir Thomas Blamey's Advanced Land Headquarters at Morotai in the Dutch East Indies and Forward Echelon Advance Land Headquarters at Manila in the Philippines.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 122‚Äì125 On Blamey's recommendation, Wilton was honoured for the \\"particularly high standard\\" of his work on the general staff with appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), promulgated on 6 March 1947.Horner, Strategic Command, p. 127 Post-war career =Rise to senior command= Wilton was still only a substantive captain at the end of hostilities, but was considered by the Military Board to be among those \\"promising officers who have forced their way to the top during the war\\" and hence to deserve retention of their wartime rank.Grey, The Australian Army, p. 167 He became Deputy Director of Military Operations and Plans at Army Headquarters (AHQ), Melbourne, in March 1946; receiving promotion to substantive lieutenant-colonel on 30 September 1946, he took charge of the same directorate the following year. Promoted substantive colonel on 11 April 1950, that year he was appointed a member of the Bridgeford Mission, which advised the Australian government on the state of the Malayan Emergency.Dennis; Grey, Emergency and Confrontation, pp. 45‚Äì47 On a visit to Singapore in February‚ÄìMarch 1951 as part of a joint planning team, he urged his British counterparts to maintain their presence in Malaya as the basis of a combined force, without which Australia would be reluctant to commit any troops for the region's security.O'Neill, Strategy and Diplomacy, pp. 227‚Äì228 Wilton relinquished his post at AHQ in November 1951, and attended the Imperial Defence College in London during 1952. Having been assigned a combat command in the Korean War, he was promoted to brigadier on 13 March 1953, arrived in Seoul within the week, and took over the 28th Commonwealth Brigade from fellow Duntroon graduate Brigadier Thomas Daly on 25 March.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 143‚Äì149 Sir Sydney Rowell (second left) and Henry Wells (second right), in 1953alt=Full-length portrait of five men in military uniforms The 28th was described in the official history of Australia's involvement in the Korean War as \\"the most nationally diverse\\" brigade in the 1st Commonwealth Division, consisting of Australian, British, Indian and New Zealand units, yet also \\"an outstandingly well-knit formation\\".O'Neill, Combat Operations, pp. 239‚Äì240 After operating on the eastern side of the Jamestown Line from April, the 28th was transferred westward to relieve the 29th Brigade at the Hook, the Commonwealth Division's most vulnerable position, on 9‚Äì10 July.O'Neill, Combat Operations, pp. 220, 274‚Äì275 At 6:15pm on 23 July, Wilton informed his battalion chiefs that an armistice was ready to be signed, and to keep patrols to the minimum level necessary for the line's security.O'Neill, Combat Operations, p. 278 The brigade's last action took place over the next three days, when it used artillery, mortar, machine-gun and rifle fire to repulse a heavy assault by Chinese troops, inflicting as many as 3,000 casualties.O'Neill, Combat Operations, p. 282McNeill, \\"General Sir John Wilton\\", pp. 316‚Äì317 Wilton later recalled the \\"terrible and gruesome sight\\" of no-man's land \\"literally carpeted with dead bodies\\". He was present for the armistice ceremony at Panmunjom on 27 July.O'Neill, Combat Operations, p. 281 Having succeeded in maintaining his command's discipline and morale during a potentially problematic time at the end of the conflict and the beginning of peace, he handed over the 28th to Brigadier Ian Murdoch on 19 February 1954.O'Neill, Combat Operations, pp. 588‚Äì590 For his service in Korea, Wilton was raised to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours on 10 June 1954. He was also awarded the US Legion of Merit for his \\"outstanding leadership and initiative\\"; the decoration was gazetted on 1 May 1956. After returning to Australia, Wilton was appointed Brigadier in Charge of Administration at Headquarters Eastern Command, his first administrative post. In November 1955 he was assigned to the General Staff at AHQ, where he was responsible for intelligence, operations and plans, and took part in Australian preparations for SEATO exercises. He was promoted to major general on 24 March 1957, and became Commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon.McNeill, \\"General Sir John Wilton\\", p. 322 Although not strongly religious, Wilton considered himself responsible for the spiritual and moral development of younger cadets; he made a point of attending church parade regularly, and in 1959 personally launched an appeal for public funds to build the college's Anzac Memorial Chapel, which would open in 1966.Moore, Duntroon, pp. 224‚Äì225Horner, Strategic Command, p. 174 His chief goal, though, was academic: concerned that graduates were at risk of falling behind their increasingly tertiary-qualified peers in industry and public service, he worked assiduously to make the college a degree-granting institution; this was realised in 1967.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 171‚Äì173, 313Moore, Duntroon, p. 265 From June 1960 through 1962, Wilton was Chief of the Military Planning Office at SEATO Headquarters, Bangkok.Grey, The Australian Army, p. 209 He believed Thailand to be strategically vital, declaring \\"if you want to hold Southeast Asia, you need to hold Thailand\\".Horner, Strategic Command, p. 179 His position allowed him to closely observe the deteriorating situation in Laos, which threatened to spill over into Thailand, and the Western Powers' growing focus on South Vietnam.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 183, 189, 191 He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1962 Queen's Birthday Honours, in particular for his \\"conspicuous devotion to duty and his singleness of purpose\\" as Commandant of Duntroon.Horner, Strategic Command, p. 193 On 21 January 1963, Wilton was promoted lieutenant general and became Chief of the General Staff (CGS), succeeding Lieutenant General Sir Reginald Pollard.Dennis et al., Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, pp. 612‚Äì613 He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1964 New Year Honours. =Chief of the General Staff= Following the lead of the US Army, in 1960 the Australian Army had replaced its former \\"triangular\\" divisional structure of three infantry battalions under a brigade headquarters, with a \\"pentropic\\" organisation consisting of five larger battalions without a brigade layer between division and battalion headquarters. This had the effect of reducing the total number of Australian battalions, while increasing their individual strength.Grey, The Australian Army, pp. 204‚Äì205 Wilton was unhappy with the pentropic structure, reasoning that the number of battalions, rather than their relative strength, was the overriding factor when considering potential overseas deployments. The US had in any event abandoned the system in June 1961. In October 1964, Wilton commissioned a review that ultimately recommended a return to the triangular formation.Dennis et al., Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, pp. 419‚Äì420 In the meantime, as a response to the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia Konfrontasi, the Australian government reintroduced conscription, which Wilton fought until convinced that the government was not going to improve pay and conditions sufficiently to attract by any other means the recruits needed to meet overseas commitments.Grey, The Australian Army, pp. 209‚Äì210 Wilton was keen to mitigate any prejudices the national servicemen might have against the regular soldiery, and vice versa; when he found a memo from an Army committee asserting that \\"it must be recognised that the NS man was likely to be a reluctant soldier\\", he wrote on it \\"This assumption not justified\\".McNeill, To Long Tan, p. 28 In February‚ÄìMarch 1965, following a request from the Malaysian government, Australia despatched 1 Squadron, Special Air Service Regiment, and 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, to Borneo‚Äîa commitment Wilton felt able to recommend as a result of the recent decisions to increase the Army's personnel and battalion numbers.Dennis; Grey, Emergency and Confrontation, p. 237Horner, Strategic Command, p. 232 alt=Military helicopter with main door open, over jungle By mid-1964, Australia had already sent a small team of military advisors, as well as a flight of newly acquired DHC-4 Caribou transports, to aid the South Vietnamese government in its fight against the Viet Cong.Odgers, 100 Years of Australians at War, pp. 300‚Äì306McNeill, To Long Tan, pp. 34‚Äì38 The 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, was deployed in May 1965.Odgers, 100 Years of Australians at War, pp. 310‚Äì312 It was attached to a US Army brigade, and Wilton was responsible for setting its operational parameters.McNeill, To Long Tan, pp. 98‚Äì99 In August, he recommended to his opposite number in the RAAF, Air Marshal Alister Murdoch, the despatch of two UH-1 Iroquois helicopters to Vietnam. Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before any large-scale commitment of Australian forces. He was exasperated when Murdoch rejected the idea on resourcing grounds, despite the fact that two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased for the express purpose of army cooperation. According to the official history of the post-war Air Force, when the Federal government deployed No. 9 Squadron and its UH-1s to Vietnam less than a year later, the unit was under-prepared for combat operations.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 289‚Äì292, 483Coulthard-Clark, The RAAF in Vietnam, p. 141 Wilton supported the RAAF's request that the deputy commander of Australian Forces Vietnam be an air officer, despite the misgivings of some senior Army personnel and the fact that an appointment of this level was not commensurate with the services' relative commitments to the conflict. In what the official history of Australia in the Vietnam War described as a \\"pragmatic and far-sighted approach\\", Wilton expressed his hope that such an arrangement would give the Air Force a closer understanding of land/air cooperation, and avoid \\"increasing differences of views about strategic and tactical concepts with the Australian Armed Forces\\".Coulthard-Clark, The RAAF in Vietnam, pp. 79‚Äì81, 83 Following the Federal government's decision in March 1966 to despatch a task force of two battalions to Vietnam, Wilton negotiated with US and South Vietnamese commanders a self-contained area of operations for the Australians, in Phuoc Tuy Province, where they could function with a reasonable degree of independence.McNeill, \\"General Sir John Wilton\\", p. 327 He also approved Nui Dat, in the centre of the province forward of the major population areas, as the task force's main base, despite its distance from support units in Vung Tau and the extra effort required to defend it.McNeill, To Long Tan, pp. 197‚Äì200 Wilton rejected a mobile role for the Australians that would have placed them under the control of a US division because, he believed, \\"their operations became a bit of a meat grinder\\" with \\"tremendous casualties\\".McNeill, To Long Tan, pp. 200‚Äì201 On 19 May 1966, he took over from Air Chief Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CCOSC), a position foreshadowing that of the modern Chief of the Defence Force.McNeill, \\"General Sir John Wilton\\", p. 328 He was succeeded as CGS by Lieutenant General Daly. According to the official history, the timing of the CCOSC handover was \\"especially significant\\" as it \\"coincided with the change in Vietnam from an Army force which was responsible to the Chief of the General Staff to a combined force responsive to the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee. Wilton, therefore, carried through his responsibilities concerning the Vietnam commitment to his new appointment.\\"McNeill, To Long Tan, p. 205 =Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee= Vietnam Wilton accepted the domino theory and never wavered in his commitment to Vietnam, but as early as mid-1967 he doubted that the war could be won unless the US was prepared to go all out and invade the North.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. XV, XIX, 279McNeill; Ekins, On the Offensive, pp. 286‚Äì287 Cautious about expanding Australia's involvement, he advocated deploying a Centurion tank squadron rather than a third infantry battalion when calls came to increase the strength of the task force in Vietnam, but in the end the Federal government announced both commitments in October 1967.McNeill; Ekins, On the Offensive, pp. 246‚Äì249 Wilton also advised the government to reject any requests from the US command in Vietnam to rotate the Australian task force out of Phuoc Tuy and display its capabilities in a wider operational arena, reasoning that it was more important for the troops to remain in the countryside they knew and continue to build relations with the local people. He nevertheless strongly backed the Australian task force commander, Brigadier Ronald Hughes, when the latter was criticised at home for conducting \\"American style operations\\" outside the immediate vicinity of Phuoc Tuy, such as the set-piece battles of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral in mid-1968.McNeill; Ekins, On the Offensive, pp. 402, 410 Conflict continued to simmer between the Army and the RAAF regarding air support, and Wilton oversaw discussions between Daly and Murdoch that secured a separate Army air organisation, leading to the formation of the Australian Army Aviation Corps in July 1968.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 301‚Äì303 On 22 August, the Federal government announced that Wilton would be promoted to general, effective 1 September, in recognition of his \\"outstanding contribution to the Commonwealth in his present appointment\\".Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 289, 407 He was the first Australian officer to attain the rank since Blamey, twenty-seven years before.Horner, Strategic Command, p. XIV 1st Armoured Regiment at Vung Tau, South Vietnam, in 1968alt=Tanks and military personnel US troop reductions in 1969 under President Richard Nixon's Vietnamization policy led to increasing demands for similar withdrawals of Australian troops. Wilton, Daly and other senior officers argued that the \\"balanced\\" nature of the Australian task force would be damaged by a piecemeal withdrawal and that the only valid form of reduction would be \\"one out, all out\\"; the government chose a phased withdrawal, pulling out one battalion in October 1970 and the other two in October and December 1971.Edwards, A Nation at War, pp. 202‚Äì204Ekins; McNeill, Fighting to the Finish, pp. xxxv‚Äìxxxvi The divisive nature of the war caused conflict within Wilton's own family; all his children actively opposed it, and in September 1969 his son Robert publicly burnt his draft deferment notice outside Parliament House, Canberra, having earlier called upon students at the Australian National University not to register for national service. The Canberra Times ran an article on the Parliament House incident, complete with a photograph of Robert burning his notice. As Australia's senior soldier, Wilton refused to comment on the situation; Robert reported that he and his father respected one another's viewpoints, and relations within the family remained amicable.Edwards, A Nation at War, pp. 212‚Äì213Horner, Strategic Command, p. XX One of the most controversial aspects of Australia's conduct of the Vietnam War had been the employment of a barrier minefield around Phuoc Tuy from 1967 to 1969. Wilton maintained that the minefield was already under construction when he first learned of it, and that he considered the decision within the purview of the commander on the ground, Brigadier Stuart Graham. When confronted with the increasing casualties among Australian troops from mines evidently lifted from the area by the Viet Cong, he pointed out that the South Vietnamese, who had been expected to patrol the minefield, were not playing their part. Wilton further believed that the barrier minefield was an innovative solution to the problems facing the task force and that the commander's decision to implement it was \\"better than sitting on his backside and not trying anything\\". He rejected suggestions by critics that the minefield was \\"the biggest blunder\\" Australia made in Vietnam, declaring that this was \\"like being wise after the event\\".McNeill; Ekins, On the Offensive, pp. 127‚Äì129Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 328‚Äì330 Joint defence aspirations Lieutenant General Wilton as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, with Group Captain alt=Informal portrait of three men in military uniforms Wilton's position as CCOSC had no statutory authority over the heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, nor a direct line of command to Australian Forces Vietnam. David Horner noted that in an emergency, Wilton \\"had to issue directives and then seek retrospective endorsement of them by either the minister or the Chiefs of Staff Committee.\\"Horner, Making the Australian Defence Force, pp. 43‚Äì44 According to historian Eric Andrews, Wilton \\"chaffed over his lack of command over the services and the need for organisational reform\\".Andrews, The Department of Defence, p. 226 While CGS, he had joined Scherger in calling for a single Australian Defence Force organisation with one Minister of Defence, in contrast to the existing arrangement where each service operated with virtual autonomy, supported by its own minister and department.Andrews, The Department of Defence, p. 183 In July 1967, he became a member of the Tertiary Education (Services' Cadet Colleges) Committee to plan a tri-service military academy, which was eventually opened as the Australian Defence Force Academy in 1986.Moore, Duntroon, pp. 307, 325 He was also able to push through a plan to establish, in 1970, the Joint Intelligence Organisation to replace the former Joint Intelligence Bureau and three single- service intelligence groups.Dennis et al., Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, p. 180 In 1967, and again in 1970, Wilton recommended the creation of a single Defence Board of Administration, consisting of the Defence Minister, the Defence Secretary, CCOSC, and the three service chiefs, to take over the functions of the Air, Military, and Naval Boards, along with those of their separate ministers. While nothing came of this at the time, Wilton was consulted by the Labor Party prior to its reorganisation of the Defence Department, which it commenced soon after defeating the Liberals in the December 1972 Federal election.Andrews, The Department of Defence, pp. 196‚Äì197 The following year, the single-service ministries were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing Department of Defence; by 1984, the CCOSC position had evolved to become the Chief of the Defence Force, directly commanding all three armed services through their respective chiefs.Horner, \\"The Evolution of Australian Higher Command Arrangements\\", pp. 24‚Äì27 Later life Wilton was succeeded as CCOSC by Admiral Sir Victor Smith on 23 November 1970, and retired from the military. He subsequently worked on the Kerr Committee that reviewed pay and conditions in the armed forces, visiting several overseas bases including Nui Dat and Vung Tau.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 361‚Äì362 Wilton finished his career as a diplomat, serving as Australia's Consul-General in New York from September 1973 to November 1975.Moore, Duntroon, p. 433 In 1979 he became one of the first sponsors of the Aboriginal Treaty Committee, which advocated for a treaty between the Federal government and Aboriginal representatives. He died of prostate cancer at his home in Canberra on 10 May 1981, aged seventy. Survived by his wife and children, Wilton was accorded a military funeral at Duntroon, in the Anzac Memorial Chapel he helped found, and cremated at Norwood Park Crematorium, Canberra.Horner, Strategic Command, p. 372 Legacy Reflecting on Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, Wilton considered that it was justified, and that the West's intervention helped delay the takeover of South Vietnam, and the spread of communism to Laos and Cambodia, by almost a decade. \\"Whether that was worthwhile\\", he added, \\"is a matter for the historian to judge\\". The key lesson, he felt, was not to intervene in a conflict \\"unless you are prepared to win\\", because it was \\"not something that you can just put one foot in and feel the temperature\\".Ekins; McNeill, Fighting to the Finish, p. 705 Biographer David Horner described Wilton as \\"arguably the most important and influential Australian Army officer in the second half of the twentieth century\\". Horner credited him with making significant contributions to the evolution of the Australian Defence Force through the pursuit of joint command and control.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 373‚Äì375 He further noted that whereas Wilton's predecessor as CCOSC, Scherger, had been promoted to 4-star rank after four years in the role, and Wilton himself after two-and-a- half, Wilton's successors gained their 4-star rank upon taking up the position, indicating its growing importance.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 289, 357 From an early age Wilton was considered cerebral and introspective; his colleagues in adulthood found him to have an incisive mind, high standards, and little inclination or capacity for small talk.McNeill, \\"General Sir John Wilton\\", p. 332 His serious demeanour earned him the ironic nicknames \\"Happy Jack\\", \\"Smiling John\\" and \\"Sir Jovial\\", though he was capable of thoughtful gestures and flashes of humour.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 173, 206, 350 Major General Paul Cullen, the Citizen Military Forces member of the Military Board from 1964 to 1966, described Wilton as \\"very stiff, very regular, very formal‚Äîbut a pleasant man\\".Baker, Paul Cullen, p. 183 Korean War historian Robert O'Neill contended that \\"One of the most remarkable aspects of his career was that he rose so far through a highly competitive profession without ever playing to the gallery.\\" Notes References           * External links Category:1910 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Australian generals Category:Australian military personnel of the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation Category:Australian military personnel of the Korean War Category:Australian military personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Australian military personnel of World War II Category:Chairmen, Chiefs of Staff Committee (Australia) Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Foreign recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Sydney Category:Royal Artillery officers Category:Royal Military College, Duntroon graduates Category:Consuls-General of Australia in New York ","title":"John Wilton (general)"},{"id":"16757823","text":"USS Wissahickon has been the name of more than one United States Navy ship, and may refer to: *, a gunboat in commission from 1861 to 1865 *, named USS SP-852 for part of her career, a patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1919 Wissahickon ","title":"USS Wissahickon"},{"id":"16757824","text":"Anne Roiphe (born December 25, 1935) is an American writer and journalist.

Voyages to Bear Island, 1604-1609 He served aboard vessels sent by the Muscovy Company on sealing voyages to Bear Island in 1604, 1605, 1606, 1608, and 1609. In 1607 he was among the sailors sent to the New World to establish Jamestown, in particular being one of the two dozen colonists led by Captain Christopher Newport that explored the upper James River in a pinnace as far as the falls near present-day Richmond, Virginia in late May of that year. In 1606 he was given command of a 20-ton pinnace. In 1608 he piloted the ship Paul, and in 1609 he was master of the ship Lioness.Purchas, S. 1625. Hakluytus Posthumus or Purchas His Pilgrimes: Contayning a History of the World in Sea Voyages and Lande Travells by Englishmen and others. Volumes XIII and XIV (Reprint 1906 J. Maclehose and sons). Voyages to Spitsbergen, 1610-1612 =1610= In 1610 Poole was again sent to Bear Island to hunt walrus, as well as search for a passage towards the North Pole. He was given command of the 70-ton Amity, with a crew of fourteen men and a boy. He bypassed Bear Island altogether, sailing straight for Spitsbergen. While Barentsz had only spent a few weeks exploring Spitsbergen and Hudson less than a month, Poole spent nearly three months (May‚ÄìAugust) exploring the west coast and hunting walrus, polar bear, and reindeer there. On 6 May he came within sight of a mountain on the south coast of Spitsbergen, which he named Muscovy Company‚Äôs Mount (modern Hornsundtind). He sailed north and sent a skiff into a small fjord. They returned with a piece of reindeer horn, resulting in Poole giving the fjord the name Horn Sound (Hornsund). Conway, W. M. 1906. No Man's Land: A History of Spitsbergen from Its Discovery in 1596 to the Beginning of the Scientific Exploration of the Country. Cambridge: At the University Press. During this voyage, he also named Ice Point (Ispynten), Bell Point (for a nearby bell-shaped mountain, now called Kapp Lyell), Bell Sound (Bellsund), Point Partition (Midterhuken), Low Sound (Van Mijenfjorden), Lowsoundness (L√•gneset, its Norwegian equivalent), Ice Sound (Isfjorden), Green Harbour (Gr√∏nfjorden), Osborne Inlet (St. Jonsfjorden), Black Point (Salpynten), Black Point Isle (Prins Karls Forland), Foul Sound (Forlandsundet), Cape Cold (Kaldneset), Fair Foreland (Fuglehuken), Deer Sound (Kongsfjorden), Close Cove (Krossfjorden), Cross Road (Ebeltofthamna), and Fairhaven (Smeerenburgfjorden).Norwegian Polar Institute Place Names of Svalbard Database Poole also obtained \\"fins\\" (baleen) and blubber from Bowhead whales that had stranded along the coast, but did not attempt to catch any of the \\"great store of whales\\" he saw in these waters, \\"for the Basques were then the only people who understood whaling.\\" =1611= His report of the number of whales found around Spitsbergen led the Muscovy Company to send two ships there the following year, 1611. One, the 60-ton bark Elizabeth, was sent to accompany the 150-ton Mary Margaret, under Stephen Bennet, on a whaling expedition to the island. Poole was sent as master of the Elizabeth, and was to pilot both vessels. Aboard the Mary Margaret was Thomas Edge, who was to be in charge of the cargoes of both vessels. Among the crew were six expert Basque whalemen from Saint-Jean-de-Luz. The expedition left Blackwall in April, but in 65¬∞ N the two ships were separated by \\"contrary winds and foul weather.\\" They found each other again in mid-May, sailing together to Cross Road, where they anchored in late May. The Mary Margaret spent the month of June hunting whales and walruses, while Poole explored to the southwest, searching for Henry Hudson's elusive Hold with Hope. After sighting this land (probably eastern Greenland) around 74¬∞, he sailed northward for Bear Island, where he anchored on 29 June. In late July, while riding at anchor on the north side of the island, Poole came into contact with three sailors sent by Edge and Bennet. They related to him the loss of the Mary Margaret in Foul Sound, which had been driven ashore by ice. He was told that there were thirty men who had landed on the south side of the island in three boats, while two other boats carrying nine men had parted company with them off Horn Sound. Poole sailed to the south side of the island, picked up the men, and sailed north to Spitsbergen. Coming to Foul Sound he found the Mary Margaret's other men, who had been carried there by an interloper from Hull, the Hopewell, under Thomas Marmaduke. Here, on 7 August, while transferring the cargo of the stricken Mary Margaret, the Elizabeth, not having enough in her hold to ballast herself, was capsized, nearly taking Poole with her. Poole was in the hold when the accident occurred, and twice while trying to climb through the hatches barrels of beer and \\"diverse other things\\" knocked him down. By \\"swimming and crawling\\" he was able to get out of the bark and to the surface where a boat rescued him. Poole said his \\"head [was] broke to the skull, and my brow that one might see the bare bones, and by mine ear I had a sore wound, likewise the ribs on my right side were all broken and sore bruised, and the collar bone of my left shoulder is broken, besides my back was so sore, that I could not suffer any man to touch it.\\" Climbing into three boats, the men rowed to the Hopewell, asking Marmaduke for help, but he refused, reportedly arming his men with pikes and lances to keep Poole and his men from boarding. Edge and other men finally convinced Marmaduke to carry them home, but only after agreeing to pay him. =1612= In 1612 Jonas Poole again sailed to Spitsbergen on a whaling expedition. Two ships were sent, the 160-ton Whale, under John Russell, and the 180-ton Sea Horse, under Thomas Edge. Poole served aboard the latter, probably as pilot. The expedition left in early April, arriving at Bear Island in early May. On 25 May they came into Foul Sound. The next day two ships came into the sound. One was a ship sent from Holland, which they had met with earlier off Bear Island. The other was an interloper from England, the Diana, of London, under Thomas Bustion of Wapping Wall. Both sailed away the following day. In early June Poole met with another interloper, the Hopewell of Hull, again under Thomas Marmaduke, which may have been fitted out this year to hunt for whales. By early June the Basque whalemen‚Äîprobably recruited from St. Jean de Luz‚Äîhad already caught several whales. In late June Poole said there were so many whales in the sound that he could not count them. On 30 June he reported that \\"there lay abundance of huge Whales in the harbour about our ships.\\" \\"All this day whales lay so thick about the ship, that some ran against our Cables, some against the Ship, and one against the Rudder. One lay under our beakhead and slept there a long while.\\" The ships returned to London later that year with 180 tons of oil from the capture of seventeen bowhead whales and two walruses. At the end of the voyage, Poole was reportedly \\"miserably and basely murdered\\" between Ratcliff and London. Legacy Many of the names that Jonas Poole gave to features on the west coast of Spitsbergen, most importantly Hornsund, Bellsund, and Isfjorden, still retain their name. The names of other features, through modern blunders in map-making and for other reasons, have been changed or altogether forgotten. Poolepynten (Poole Point), on the southeastern coast of Prins Karls Forland (Prince Charles Foreland), was named in his honor.

Their vision was of a swinging show with a big band sound, styling threads and songs everyone could dance to. The band took its name from the popular baseball bat commonly known as a \\"Louisville Slugger\\". (One swings a baseball bat?) This flash of inspiration took place outside the doors of the art deco Enmore Theatre in Sydney, after the band's first photo shoot. Bandleader and drummer \\"Nugget\\" was rapping in hip-hop clubs at 16, drumming in the hardcore band Pitbull Attack, and ice-skating professionally, until his constantly recurring injuries forced him off the ice. With some influence from his sister, \\"The Boss\\", and her musical tastes in ska, swing, rockabilly and anything from their parents' era, they set out to find others with the same passion. Six months later they had found enough people for a first rehearsal. This included \\"The Boss\\" meeting Gil Morgan, then working in a shop, who became the band's first guitarist and one of the principal songwriters, writing the songs \\"Masterplan\\" and the audience favourite \\"Delores (The Unstoppable)\\". The first line-up included the vocalist Julijani Vasilkov who also contributed lyrics to several compositions. Eventually the band was fronted by Melanie Alexander. Within one month of their first rehearsal and with only five songs, \\"The Boss\\" had them booked on the Vans Warped Tour, followed by live shows and extensive touring. They became the house band on the Nine Network's short-lived programs Sam and The Fatman and Our Place.

He was the son of Numerius Fabius Ambustus. He served as consul three times: in 360, 356, and 354 BC. His consulships occurred during a time in which Rome was reasserting itself following its defeat at the hands of the Gauls in the Battle of the Allia of 387 BC. He defeated the Hernici in 356, and Tibur in 354, earning a triumph for the latter victory.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita vii. 11 He further succeeded against the Falisci, but was defeated by Tarquinia. As he was absent from Rome when the time came for holding the comitia, the senate, which did not like to entrust them to his colleague, who had appointed a plebeian dictator, and still less to the dictator himself, nominated interreges for the purpose. The object of the patricians was to secure both places in the consulship for their own order again, which was effected by Ambustus, who seems to have returned to Rome in the meantime. He was appointed the eleventh interrex in 355, and declared two patricians consuls in violation of the Licinian law (the plebs had been made eligible for the consulship again, over his objections),Livy, Ab Urbe Condita vii. 17 although he was not successful in his object.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita vii. 22 He served as interrex again in 351, and as dictator in 351. There is some disagreement between scholars over whether he ever served as censor, possibly in 358, and as princeps senatus later in life (the two questions are connected, as all principes prior to 209 BC were censorii). He was possibly the interrex appointed in 340 BC named M. Fabius, other possibilities includes his son, Marcus Fabius Ambustus or another contemporary Fabii, Marcus Fabius Dursuo, consul in 345 BC.Broughton, vol i, pp. 136 He was alive in 325, when his son, Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, was Master of the Horse to Lucius Papirius Cursor, and fled to Rome to implore protection from the vengeance of the dictator. He interceded on his son's behalf both with the senate and the people.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita viii. 33 He was also father of Marcus Fabius Ambustus, who also served as Master of the Horse.

Arshak III is often known as the last serving Roman client king of Armenia. During his reign, the part of Armenia that Arshak III governed was under Roman rule from the Peace of Acilisene. Family and early life Arshak III was the first- born son of the previous Roman client Armenian King Papas (Pap), who reigned from 370 until 374, and his wife, the Armenian noblewoman called Zarmandukht.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book V, Chapter 37 He had a younger brotherFaustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book V, Chapter 37 called Vologases. His known grandparents, both from his paternal side, were the previous ruling Arsacid monarchs Arsaces II (Arshak II) and his wife Pharantzem.Lenski, Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D., p.170 Arshak III was named in honor of his late paternal grandfather; several of his Parthian, Pontian and Armenian ancestors ruled with this name as King. Arshak III was born at an unknown date during his father's reign and was raised in Armenia. Following the assassination of his father in 374, as Arshak III and his brother were too young to rule, the Roman emperor Valens sent their paternal first cousin Varasdates (Varazdat) to occupy the Armenian throne. Their cousin, who was a young man highly reputed for his mental and physical gifts, had lived in Rome for an unknown period of time. Varasdates began his rule under the regency of Mushegh I Mamikonian, whose family were pro-Roman. Rise to the Throne In 378, following the failed reign of Varasdates and the murder of his regent Mushegh Mamikonian, the brother of Mushegh, Manuel Mamikonian,Adalian, Historical Dictionary of Armenia, p.177 filled his late brother's position of Sparapet. Manuel bore a grudge against the Armenian king, and raised a military force which drove Varasdates out of ArmeniaAdalian, Historical Dictionary of Armenia, p.177 and back to Rome.

As Manuel Mamikonian died at the same time as Vologases did, the authority of Arshak III became lessened by the Sassanid invasions from Persia of Armenia. In 387, the last year of his kingship, Arshak III resided in Ekeleac‚Äô, also known as Ekeghiats, in Western Armenia,Hovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.92 as he then ruled only Western Armenia along a line from Erzurum to Mush.

It was invented by Winslow Lewis who patented the design in 1810. The primary marketing point of the Lewis lamp was that it used less than half the oil of the prior oil lamps they replaced. The lamp used a similar design to an Argand lamp, adding a parabolic reflector behind the lamp and a magnifying lens made from green bottle glass in front of the lamp. A similar variant using a parabolic reflector was created by the inventor of the Argand lamp, Aim√© Argand. While the Argand variant became widely used by European lighthouses, the Lewis lamp design was selected by the United States for use in American lighthouses. The Lewis lamp would use groups of lamps. The Lewis lamp design proved to have several flaws. To begin, it was really an inferior version of the Argand lamp. The reflector was made of copper with an interior silver plating to reflect light; however, the thin copper would warp under the heat of the lamps to become more spherical than parabolic. Also, the silver plating was of poor quality and would be scratched off during routine cleanings. Adding to the problem was poor draft for the combustion gases, so that soot would build up on the components, decreasing any alleged improvement. In particular, there was a green lens, which ostensibly improved the visibility, but which was prone to being covered in soot. The sooting became such a problem that the lenses were removed from the lamps. The Lewis lamp was the paramount design used in American lighthouses for a number of years. In part, this was due to the federal government's distinct preference for awarding contracts to the lowest bidder. It was also claimed that the Lewis lamp would use substantially less fuel than the Argand lamps, which was true (provided one did not take into account the quality of the illumination). Additionally, there were allegations (never proved) of an untoward relationship between Mr. Lewis and the contracting federal officers. The better view seems to be that the federal officers were not engineers, and were in no way fit to make an evaluation of the quality of the lamps. In fact, Congress eventually established a committee process to review the specifications for the lamps. At a point, the federal officer made claims that the Fresnel lens was too complicated to be used by members of the lighthouse service. In fact, such concerns turned out to be baseless. In 1852 the Lewis lamps began being replaced with Fresnel lenses, due to the improved viewing distance offered by the Fresnel lens design. This transition was completed by the end of the American Civil War. Fresnel lenses were initially more expensive to install, but they used only one wick and provided better and more focused light, thereby using even less fuel than the Lewis Lamps.

This was the first time anyone was ever released from death row by retrial in Japan. He is now a leading figure in Japan for the movement to abolish the death penalty.McNeill, David; Mason, C. M. (August 4, 2007). \\"One who has lived to tell the tale\\". The Japan Times. Background On December 30, 1948, an unknown killer broke into the house of a 76-year-old Buddhist priest and his 52-year-old wife in Kumamoto Prefecture on Kyushu and murdered them using an axe and a knife. The killer also wounded their two young daughters, aged 12 and 14. During the same period, Sakae Menda, a poor and uneducated farmhand, was arrested on the charge of stealing rice. Arrest and trial Police held Menda for three weeks, without allowing him access to a lawyer, until they extracted a confession. During interrogation, he was starved of food, water and sleep, and beaten with bamboo sticks while being suspended upside down from a ceiling. The police eventually coerced Menda into signing a written statement. He was tried and was convicted of double homicide despite pleading innocent. On March 23, 1950, Judge Haruo Kinoshita sentenced him to death. The Supreme Court of Japan upheld his sentence on December 25, 1951. A lawyer only came to see Menda once before the trial. The lawyer, a Buddhist monk, came to pray for him, but offered no professional expertise to help him fight the charges, but instead told Menda to accept his fate. His trial did not include any physical evidence or the witness accounts that proved Menda had an alibi. He was wrongly convicted of murder and robbery based on the extorted confession.\\"Free After 12,598 Days\\". Ocala Star Banner July 16, 1983. p. 1B. Google News. Retrieved March 12, 2014. Incarceration Menda was incarcerated at the Fukuoka Detention Center in solitary confinement. He was held in a 5 square meter unheated cell that was lit day and night and monitored constantly. Under the Japanese 1907 penal code, death row inmates, unless they are involved in legal appeals, could be taken away for execution at prison gallows at any time, with little notice. Executions in Japan are typically held in secret, and prisoners are either not warned of their impending execution or are notified only on the morning of the day of the execution. Their families are informed later so they can collect the corpse for cremation.Pilkington, Ed (November 16, 2007). \\"Three stories of innocents on death row\\". Taipei Times. In prison, Menda converted to Christianity and began reading the Bible and transcribing books into Braille. Retrial Menda submitted six petitions for retrial although initially he did not have access to a lawyer. The Fukuoka District High Court ruled on the reopening of the case in 1979. The retrial began on September 27, 1979. The retrial allowed records that proved his alibi to be submitted, as well as a statement from a witness saying that she had lied under duress. On July 15, 1983, after 80 judges had been involved, the court delivered the verdict of an acquittal based on determination that he had falsely confessed and that the prosecution had failed to disclose exculpatory evidence to Menda's lawyers prior to his trial. The court acknowledged that the police had concealed his alibi showing he was not at the scene of the crime. Menda was released after 34 years on death row at the age of 54. He was the first person in Japan‚Äôs history to be released from death row.McGue, Kevin (June 15, 2009). \\"Hung jury\\". Japan Today.

The settlement dates back at least as far as 1110 CE although its center has moved to twice to its current location. Since its founding, it has been an agricultural community, today raising crops such as peanuts, corn and sorghum, although there are some handcrafts as well. The town is known for its traditions related to the Feast of the Cross, but even more so for its ‚Äúcabo del a√±o‚Äù altars on Day of the Dead, which are dedicated to family members who have died during the previous year. These have been declared a cultural heritage of the state of Puebla and bring tourists to the town, mostly from Puebla. The town Former monastery of San Mart√≠n de Tours The town of Huaquechula is about sixty km from the state capital, in the western part of the state. It is centered on a main plaza, which has pieces representing the area's past such as a calendar stone, fragments of a stone head of Quetzalcoatl and tombstone with the date written in according to the Aztec calendar. The plaza's fountain is made of black sandstone. Facing this plaza are the municipal ‚Äúpalace‚Äù a parish church, a cultural center called Cuauhquechollan and a former monastery from the 16th century. The monastery was begun in 1531 and was finished in 1580, built by the Franciscan order, with attribution to Juan de Alameda, whose remains are buried there. It is similar to the monastery in Huejotzingo, though it lacks that building's pre- Hispanic symbolism. The facade is Plateresque with a richly adorned main portal in sandstone. The open chapel is Gothic. The main altarpiece in the monastery is also Plateresque and dates from the 17th century and is over ten meters high and five meters wide. The former cloister area is now a local museum. The walls still contains remnants of the monastery's rich mural work, and the rooms contains archeological pieces, copies of various codices and a section dedicated to Day of the Dead. In front, there is a stone cross over an image of the world and images of the sun and moon. The town also has other reminders of its long history. The Piedra M√°scara (Stone Mask) monument is located on the old road to San Juan Vallarta. It represents the old gods of the pre Hispanic population. The Piedra del Sol y la Luna (Stone of the Sun and Moon) is located on the old road to Xonaca, and depicts a lunar eclipse. The Piedra del Coyote (Coyote Stone) is near the river that leads to Xonaca. It represents the death of a coyote. A cross was later erected over this stone. The patron saint is Saint Francis of Assisi, whose feast day is celebrated on October 4. Socioeconomics As has been for centuries, the economy is based on agriculture, growing peanuts, corn, onions and sorghum, along with livestock and basic commerce. Traditional handcrafts include wax items, items made from tin and pressed glass such as jars, candelabras and incense burners, often with reliefs of angels, the Virgin Mary and flowers. Cabo del a√±o altars and the Feast of the Holy Cross left The town is known for two annual events, with traditions found nowhere else. The better known of these is the creation of ‚Äúcabo del a√±o‚Äù (end of the year) altars for family members who have died in the past year. Like the rest of Mexico, residents of Huaquechula celebrate Day of the Dead, with the traditional ‚Äúofrenda‚Äù or altar for all loved ones, but those who have died received their own altar on the first Day of the Dead after their demise. These altars are generally very large in the form of a pyramid, covered in white satin or crepe paper, folded and gathered over the facade to simulate clouds. The upper levels are supported with columns, most often in Baroque estipite. The altars are a fusion of pre Hispanic ornamental tradition and altars originally created for Maundy Thursday, which accounts for their white character. They are constructed anew for each recently deceased and materials can cost between 3,000 and 15,000 pesos, depending on size and richness of adornment. thumb Most cabo del a√±o altars have three levels although sometimes this varies. The lowest level represents life on earth for the deceased. A photograph of the person is placed in the center, traditionally arranged so that it can be viewed only indirectly with a mirror. There are several theories as to why, such as the mirror represents the entrance to the beyond or underworld, a representation of eternity or a symbol that the person is no longer here. Around the photo are various offerings of things that the person liked in life. The most common are food items such as plates of mole, tamales, sweets, fruit, hot chocolate, atole, tequila, mezcal and beer. There are also particular breads baked for these kinds of altars in this town such as ‚Äúhojaldra‚Äù to represent the skull and bones of the deceased, a ‚Äúrosquete‚Äù to represent the face and pan de muerto to represent the human body covered in its own blood (sugar colored red). There are also wax candles to give light in the darkness, twelve images of angels, one for every month of the year, incense and images of crying angels to represent the bereaved family. There can also be sugar miniatures of animals such as sheep, ducks and donkeys, especially if the deceased was a child. The second level is dedicated to the link between humanity and the Divine, as well as heaven. Here images of angels, the Virgin Mary and the Host can be found along with religious relics and candles of various sizes. In many of the altars today, these have been replaced all or in part with electric bulbs. Decorative elements include sugar skulls, incense burners and marigold flowers. The third level is dedicated to the Divine, often represented with a cross or an image of the Trinity. These altars are placed in a front hall or other room close to the main front entrance. Most often they are open to be viewed by the public on November 1 and 2. Custom requires that these families offer food and drink to visitors and includes traditional foods such as hot chocolate, atole, mole, tamales and bread. Most tourists to this event come from the state of Puebla but it has started to attract visitors from other parts of Mexico and abroad. Although families with these altars are in mourning, most are also proud to show this particular custom to visitors and talk about the deceased's life. The altars were declared part of the Cultural Heritage of Puebla in 1977. One major festival is that of the Feast of the Holy Cross, which dates back far into the colonial period. It has a community cross made from basalt called the ‚ÄúCruz de Huaquechula‚Äù which is incrusted with various relics related to the original cross of Christ. It is said to be so heavy that it cannot be lifted unless the bearers pray and the church plays a special melody on its bells. The festival lasts nine days beginning in April ending on May 3, with mass, traditional dance, food and music played by bands playing wind instruments, and fireworks set off from large frames in the shape bulls. The event has been named part of the Cultural Heritage of Puebla. During this event, traditional festive wear such as that of the charro and the China Poblana can be seen. History The name glyph in the Nahuatl language was a hill with the heads of an eagle and a roseate spoonbill. The name comes from Nahuatl cuauhquechollan meaning \\"place of eagles and roseate spoonbills\\". The settlement dates back to 1110CE, founded by groups of Xicalancas and Teochichimecas, just north of the current town center. In 1200, the town was refounded by the Nahuas, just south of the modern town layout which was established by the Spanish in 1520. In the early 16th century, the place was the site of an armed clash between Tlaxcaltecas and Mexicas in which the former wreaked havoc. A son of Moctezuma Xocoyotzin ('Moctezuma the Younger', or Moctezuma II; c.1466-June 29, 1520), the Huey Tlatoani of the Mexicas from 1502 until 1520, died there in combat.Francisco Javier Clavijero, Historia antigua de M√©xico, Book V, p. 203.

The battle was the last major engagement in the Hanzhong Campaign, in which Liu Bei emerged victorious and subsequently declared himself King of Hanzhong. Background Cao Cao's general Xiahou Yuan was defeated and killed by Liu Bei at the Battle of Mount Dingjun in 219. In retaliation, Cao Cao led a large army to attack Liu Bei's camp at the south of the Han River. Liu Bei sent his generals Zhao Yun and Huang Zhong to defend. Huang Zhong and Zhang Zhu went to destroy the enemy's supplies while Zhao Yun would remain in the camp with Zhang Yi unless they did not return. The battle Huang Zhong's army moved to burn the supplies of grain Cao Cao had at the North Mountain; his troops marched in the night, and at sunrise they reached the granary. Wei general Zhang He's army arrived before Huang Zhong could successfully burn the grain. Cao Cao then sent Wei general Xu Huang to intercept Huang Zhong and block his retreat. He succeeded, and Huang Zhong's army was surrounded. Zhao Yun's army dispatched to look for Huang Zhong after he had not returned by noon. Zhao Yun left Zhang Yi in charge of the camp's defense. He then departed to find Huang Zhong in battle, and successfully rescued him and retreated back to the main camp. When Zhang Yi heard that Cao Cao's army was in pursuit of Zhao Yun, and was headed towards the main camp he thought they should close the gates while they make preparations. However, as soon as Zhao Yun returned to camp he ordered all flags and banners removed, all drums silenced, and the gates to be left open completely. He stationed all his archers and crossbowmen in a covered area outside, and he stood in front of the gates. Fearing an ambush, Cao Cao ordered his men to retreat. As his men began to retreat Zhao Yun ordered his men to beat the drums as loudly as they could, and rain arrows down on the retreating enemy. Zhao Yun, Huang Zhong, and Zhang Zhu closed in on Cao Cao's army. They rushed toward the Han River, and in confusion many were pushed into the river and drowned. Meanwhile, Meng Da and Liu Feng arrived and burned all the enemy supplies at the North Mountain. Aftermath Liu Bei came and inspected the battlefield and exclaimed, \\"Zhao Yun has valor through and through\\". He ordered a celebration to late that night honoring Zhao Yun. From then on, Liu Bei's army called Zhao Yun \\"General of Tiger's Might\\" (). In popular culture The battle is featured as a playable stage in Koei's video game Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends.

The image of an injective analytic function f : D ‚Üí C > from the unit disk D onto a subset of the complex plane contains the disk > whose center is f(0) and whose radius is f‚Ä≤(0)/4. The theorem is named after Paul Koebe, who conjectured the result in 1907. The theorem was proven by Ludwig Bieberbach in 1916. The example of the Koebe function shows that the constant 1/4 in the theorem cannot be improved (increased). A related result is the Schwarz lemma, and a notion related to both is conformal radius. Gr√∂nwall's area theorem Suppose that :g(z) = z +b_1z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2} + \\\\cdots is univalent in z > 1. Then :\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} nb_n^2 \\\\le 1. In fact, if r > 1, the complement of the image of the disk z > r is a bounded domain X(r). Its area is given by : \\\\int_{X(r)} dx\\\\,dy = {1\\\\over 2i} \\\\int_{\\\\partial X(r)}\\\\overline{z}\\\\,dz = {1\\\\over 2i}\\\\int_{z=r}\\\\overline{g}\\\\,dg=\\\\pi r^2 - \\\\pi\\\\sum nb_n^2 r^{-2n}. Since the area is positive, the result follows by letting r decrease to 1. The above proof shows equality holds if and only if the complement of the image of g has zero area, i.e. Lebesgue measure zero. This result was proved in 1914 by the Swedish mathematician Thomas Hakon Gr√∂nwall. Koebe function The Koebe function is defined by :f(z)=\\\\frac{z}{(1 - z)^2}=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty n z^n Application of the theorem to this function shows that the constant 1/4 in the theorem cannot be improved, as the image domain f(D) does not contain the point z = ‚àí1/4 and so cannot contain any disk centred at 0 with radius larger than 1/4. The rotated Koebe function is :f_\\\\alpha(z)=\\\\frac{z}{(1-\\\\alpha z)^2}=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty n\\\\alpha^{n-1} z^n with Œ± a complex number of absolute value 1. The Koebe function and its rotations are schlicht: that is, univalent (analytic and one-to-one) and satisfying f(0) = 0 and f‚Ä≤(0) = 1. Bieberbach's coefficient inequality for univalent functions Let : g(z) = z + a_2z^2 + a_3 z^3 + \\\\cdots be univalent in z < 1\\\\. Then :a_2\\\\le 2. This follows by applying Gronwall's area theorem to the odd univalent function : g(z^{-2})^{-1/2}= z -{1\\\\over 2} a_2 z^{-1} + \\\\cdots. Equality holds if and only if g is a rotated Koebe function. This result was proved by Ludwig Bieberbach in 1916 and provided the basis for his celebrated conjecture that an ‚â§ n, proved in 1985 by Louis de Branges. Proof of quarter theorem Applying an affine map, it can be assumed that :f(0)=0,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, f^\\\\prime(0)=1, so that : f(z) = z + a_2 z^2 + \\\\cdots . If w is not in f(D), then :h(z)={wf(z)\\\\over w-f(z)} = z +(a_2+w^{-1}) z^2 + \\\\cdots is univalent in z < 1\\\\. Applying the coefficient inequality to f and h gives : w^{-1} \\\\le a_2 + a_2 + w^{-1}\\\\le 4, so that : w\\\\ge {1\\\\over 4}. Koebe distortion theorem The Koebe distortion theorem gives a series of bounds for a univalent function and its derivative. It is a direct consequence of Bieberbach's inequality for the second coefficient and the Koebe quarter theorem. Let f(z) be a univalent function on z < 1 normalized so that f(0) = 0 and f'(0) = 1 and let r = z.

It is located in the heart of the city of Dehra Dun on Cross Road. The school is regarded as among the best schools in India based on its consistent results in both the 10th and 12th examinations and the magnitude of extra-curricular activities and sports in its culture. History Prior to World War I, there were a number of civil and military officers and resident Europeans and Anglo-Indians in Dehradun. The only English school in the town at the time was the Convent of Jesus & Mary. For imparting proper education to the wards of British officials, stationed in India, a school committee was formed with the aim of forming more schools. The committee consisted of Rev. R.E. Bruce, Major G.A. Beazeley, R.E., Mr. R.S. Pearson, IFS, Lt. Gray, Mr. J.D. Maitland Kirman (honorary secretary and treasurer) and Mrs. R. Bruce. The committee in 1915 engaged staff and rented the house ‚Äì No. 52 by the Eastern Canal Road, known as \\"Cold Harbour\\" ‚Äì to serve as a temporary school building. The St. Thomas' Day School was opened in January 1916 with Miss Priscilla C. Wells as headmistress, two teachers ‚Äì Miss Hannah and Miss Moses ‚Äì and 34 children. Later on, an application was made to the municipal board of Dehradun, for the lease of Nazul, land and the present site of the school was maintained. Funds were arranged and the construction of the school was entrusted to Mr. Jones, district engineer of Dehradun. He designed a building, consisting of a central hall, four classrooms and a back verandah. As the number of children on the roll increased, additional classrooms became necessary, and the U.P. Government was approached for a building grant. This could not be given except to a society, and so a school society was subsequently formed and registered with the registrar of joint stock companies ‚Äì U.P. in February 1924. Till 1947, the school taught only up to the middle school, and it was only the following year that the U.P. Government accorded the school the status of being a high school. The institution has always been co-educational throughout the 103 years of its existence. The same institute also has a sister concern school \\"St Jude's School\\" which was formerly established for pre-schooling and kindergarten till 2nd grade but went on to become a full-fledged senior secondary school.  Academics  Initially the school was affiliated to General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), A&O; level. Later in the early 1960s it was affiliated to Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations. The school conducts both the standard 10th ICSE and the standard 12th ISC examinations. At the present moment the institution has classes from III to XII with a strength of over 2200 students, 90 teaching staff and 25 support staff.

Hilu was AMF's production version of a boat variety more commonly found in designs hand built by outrigger aficionados. Hilu utilizes fiberglass pontoons and carries a single polyester lateen sail mounted to an un-stayed aluminum mast. Unlike most of the sailboats in their catalog, the Hilu was commissioned by and expressly designed for AMF. Hilu is the Hawaiian name for the Black Striped Wrasse,http://www.coralreefnetwork.com/marlife/fishes/hname.htm a species of reef fish, apparently alluding to the Polynesian heritage of the sailing canoe. This added yet another species to AMF's creel of sailboats named for oceanic wildlife.

Characteristics  The Hilu is a tacking outrigger.http://www.tacking-outrigger.com The hulls are of unequal length and displacement, the mast is stepped in the larger of the two pontoon hulls. The Hilu is sometimes mistaken for a catamaran or a proa, however it is neither. A catamaran has two identical hulls, a proa shunts rather than tacking and jibing to come about. Hilu tacks and jibes as a normal sailboat, it has permanent fore and aft ends rather than a permanent windward and leeward side, and it does not \\"shunt\\"Crab claw sail to come about so is more akin to the Malibu Outrigger of the 1950s.http://www.duckworksmagazine.com/03/r/designs/malibu/outrigger.htm Due to the asymmetric sailing behavior, Hilu is not quite as easy for the novice sailor to master as some of AMF's other beach boats.  History  To create the Hilu, AMF commissioned an industrial design/commercial art group in Farmington, CT who had no prior experience with boat design. Upon its debut, experienced sailors were not impressed by the way the Hilu sailed.Discussion with the author of The Sunfish Bible, AMF HILU - Message #4147 - Jan 15, 2007 https://groups.yahoo.com/group/sunfish_sailor Hilu never received the same level of acceptance by the sailing public as other AMF boats, particularly the Sunfish. This may have been due to its design not being quite so novice friendly, it may have been the experimental nature of AMF's attempt to bring something different to the commercial side of beach boating.

It was first published by the magazine Astounding Science Fiction in January and February 1957. The story is about two planets, Home and Rathe, whose inhabitants are in contact, and the consequences of this contact are explored. Plot background Rathe and Home are planets which form a double planet system where each keeps the same face towards the other. Since the side of Home that faces Rathe is entirely ocean, Rathe was unknown to the population of Home before an expedition to the middle of the far ocean to observe an eclipse. Having discovered Rathe, and realizing that it is inhabited, the people of Home are consumed by xenophobia. The slogan \\"Get out of my sky!\\" has been taken up by demagogues. The people of Rathe knew of Home from ancient times, but did not know it was inhabited. The inhabited side of Home was discovered by an expedition to a third planet. Now they too are afraid of the unknown intentions of their neighbors. The plot The planet of Rathe and Home are locked into a deadly nuclear arms-race, each possessing weapons ready to launch a fiery consummation of the policy of Mutual Assured Destruction. Although satellite images show that Rathe possess only atomic (fission) weapons, less powerful than Home's thermonuclear arsenal, there is still enough megatonnage on each planet to totally destroy the other. In a huge tent, a man almost dances a message out to the assembled masses. He whips up a frenzy of anti-Rathe sentiment, but as the crowd join in, he acts visibly and physically shocked, cowering and shaking. He begs the congregation to listen and to see reason before it is too late... Both Rathe and Home are deserts - Rathe one of sand, Home one of water - and after a Naval expedition to observe a total solar eclipse (rare in the three-sun system of Rathe and Home) Aidregh - the Minister for the most powerful island nation on Home - is struggling to maintain the balance of power among his fellow ministers and prevent the terrible war that will result if a more xenophobic minister seizes power. A secret manned space-flight to a nearby planet of Home shows that Rathe had also visited the planetoid. This Home expedition also shows that Rathe has atomic 'firing plazas' each holding large enough atomic weapons to totally devastate Home. The Home expedition has been in flight for over a year, rushing back because of the importance of this news. As a result, the crew are exhausted. The captain dies suddenly of an embolism brought on by stress, lack of sleep and an overdose of amphetamine. Unknown to the rest of Home, Aidregh has a microwave video-link to Rathe, which he uses to contact Margent, a Ratheman liaison. Margent and Aidregh discuss the feelings towards the war each planet has, and finally Margent suggests that a Home contingent, including Aidregh, visit Rathe to settle the problem once and for all. The rocket journey is scheduled for a year later. Dr. Ni (an old friend of Aidregh) and his daughter, Aidregh and his son Aidresne and several other Home-men eventually arrive on Rathe. After being secluded for several days, they are reunited and Margent describes how his planet has 'lost its mind'. Rathe, it seems, is the home of telepathic and psionics that exploit what is known as Voisk forces. The psionic abilities are limited by connections - replacing a circuit-board from a computer will not stop it from working, as long as the board is replaced with a suitably connected schematic diagram. Margent - now revealed to be a title, not a name - is one of several Rathemen in charge (who all look worryingly similar to each other) describes how his world was once much more powerful in psionic powers than now. The war effort, it seems, and the need to think in terms of total destruction of another world, have effectively crippled what psionic ability the Rathemen once had. To prevent the war, Margent suggests that Aidresne and his betrothed Corlant (who is Dr. Ni's daughter) be taught a psionic 'trick' that allows them to influence others' decisions. Aidregh and Ni strongly oppose this, because of the risks, and Aidregh himself volunteers. Aidregh is painfully taught the trick of charisma that allows him to psionically project his feelings to others so that they might be influenced by it. Before an assembled audience of Rathemen, and at great risk to his own mind, he attempts this. Succeeding through great difficulty, the Rathemen agree it is time for the people from Home to return and convince their fellows that the war is unwinnable, and that there must be peace. Aidregh gives a public talk, almost dancing his message. In a huge tent, he almost dances a message out to the assembled Home masses. He whips up a frenzy of anti-Rathe sentiment, but as the crowd join in, he acts visibly and physically shocked, cowering and shaking. Using the Voisk force he has been taught, Aidregh begs the congregation to listen and to see reason before it is too late... There is still time! This is where we and the grass grow up like music...'

Gameplay This game is mostly a visual novel, but there are a few new techniques specific for the DS. When using Lux-Pain, the player 'digs' into their surroundings using the stylus and touch screen. The player can also 'dig' into people's feelings and emotions to find worms, or deep emotions. However, if the player digs in too long and is unable to erase the worms that surround the person, the person's mind becomes corrupt and it becomes game over for the player. The game also ends if you lose a battle against one of the Silent. However, in some cases, if you lose against a Silent (mainly in boss battles) you are able to retry. Plot Lux-Pain is set in the historical Kisaragi City, a town plagued by mysteries from small mishaps to murders - with no logical explanation as to why these events occur. It seems \\"Silent\\", a worm born through hate and sadness, has infected humans and forced them to commit atrocious crimes. Atsuki's parents are the victim of such crimes. To avenge his parents, Atsuki goes through a dangerous operation to acquire Lux-Pain in his left arm, a power so strong that it turns his right eye golden when using it to seek and destroy Silent for good. In this game, however, there is a strong difference between Silent and worms. Worms are a sort of offspring created by Silent that are transferred to anyone who comes in contact with the host of the specific Silent. Worms are much weaker than Silent and are eliminated after simply finding them with the stylus and pressing on them for several seconds. Silent are considered the bosses of the game and though you face many smaller Silent they slowly show the larger Silent who is much stronger. After the first 10 \\"episodes\\" you face the first true Silent. This Silent is caused by the emotions of a deceased 12-year-old girl whose parents left for dead in her room. Though not mentioned specifically there are over 685 known Silent and you start with the 683rd. Development Lux-Pain was developed by a team of ten people at Killaware, which was founded by former Atlus members Takeo Higashino and Kazuhiro Yamao. The game took a full 14 months to develop from start to finish. Higashino described the plot as being \\"dark,\\" and stated that social problems such as truancy, group suicide, mental abuse on the internet, and cruelty to animals inspired him to create the game. He stated, \\"I think this game is a kind of 'antithesis' against the distortion of the current education or the recent crimes that occur amongst young people.\\" Lux-Pain was translated internally at Killaware, but the Japanese voice acting was replaced for its localizations. The soundtrack for Lux-Pain was composed by Kenji Ito and Yasuyuki Suzuki. It was released in Japan April 23, 2008. A CD featuring two vocal songs from the game (\\"Holding the Holy Pain\\" and \\"On/Off\\") sung by Yoko Takahashi was released on March 12, 2008. Two pre-order bonuses were included with the game with its release in Japan. They include Lux-Sound, a set of pre-arranged songs from the game's soundtrack along with a drama track; and Lux-Paint, an artbook. Reception Lux-Pain received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" from video game critics according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, however, Famitsu gave it a score of one seven, one eight, and two sevens for a total of 29 out of 40. Its localization was almost universally mentioned as being poor, with Austin Shau's GameSpot review noting that it \\"makes the story harder to follow than it should be,\\" and \\"results in too much unintentional humor to take any of Lux-Pain's commentary seriously.\\" The review expressed disappointment over the notion that what could have been a \\"poignant experience\\" is ruined by its failure \\"to deliver on the most basic element of a novel-style adventure,\\" referring to its apparent poor writing. Daemon Hatfield of IGN remarked, \\"This graphic adventure doesn't make any sense, and all players are allowed to do is clumsily poke at static scenes and wade through endless pages of poorly-translated dialogue.\\" Modojo's Robert Falcon panned the game entirely, calling the characters \\"useless.\\" The Daily Telegraph gave a more favorable review, though writer Chris Schilling also mentioned the game's \\"wonky localisation, with grammatical oddities ranging from female characters being referred to as ‚Äòhe‚Äô to confusion over whether the setting is Japan or America.\\" He opined that while \\"you‚Äôd presume those issues would be difficult to overlook ... developer Killaware has crafted a world you‚Äôll find ... difficult to pull yourself out of\\" and praised its \\"genuinely interesting themes ‚Äì the kind most gamers are afraid to approach.\\" References External links *Official website * Category:2008 video games Category:Adventure games Category:J.C.Staff Category:Marvelous Entertainment Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Video games scored by Kenji Ito Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Visual novels ","title":"Lux-Pain"},{"id":"16759077","text":"Whirinaki Te Pua-a-TƒÅne Conservation Park is a publicly accessible conservation park in the North Island of New Zealand. The park is centered on the town of Minginui and part of the eastern boundary flanks Te Urewera. The Whirinaki Forest is one of the world's last prehistoric rainforests. The Department of Conservation is responsible for administering the park jointly with the local iwi, NgƒÅti Whare. Tramping is a popular recreation in the park and there is a network of 175 km of tracks and 9 huts that are used for this purpose. Mangamate Hut, one of the backcountry huts in the park The unsealed River Road provides access to a carpark and the starting point of many walks. Short walks lead through native bush to Waiatiu Falls, Arohaki Lagoon, Te Whaiti-Nui-A-Toi Canyon, and Whirinaki Falls, respectively. The rain-fed Arohaki Lagoon is often alive with Southern Bell Frogs. Longer tramping tracks connect several huts and two other access roads. The forests were a focus of protests over logging in the 1970s and 80s. Large parts of the park remain covered in native podocarp forest featuring rimu, totara, kahikatea, matai (Prumnopitys taxifolia), and miro. Some higher parts contain beech forest. The forest supports a wide range of birds, some of which are endangered. Whirinaki is the location of Nga Hua a Tane, a radical place based research program on rainforests and the ecosystem services they provide to support life on our planet, led by the local school, Te Kura Toitu o Te Whaiti Nui-a-Toi and its community. In 2010, a co-governance agreement was signed with Ngati Whare as part of a treaty settlement. As part of the settlement, the New Zealand government apologised for past injustices and acknowledged the park was integral to Ngati Whare's cultural identity and wellbeing. The settlement provided for a joint Ngati Whare and Crown regeneration project, which aimed to regenerate 640ha of exotic pine adjacent to the park back to indigenous podocarp forest, with David Bellamy as patron. The park's name was changed from Whirinaki Forest Park to Whirinaki Te Pua-a-TƒÅne Conservation Park. Whirinaki Te Pua-a-TƒÅne means the abundance of TƒÅne. Moerangi Mountain Bike Track The Moerangi Track is a dual purpose track for mountain bikers and trampers located in the Whirinaki Te Pu-a-Tane Conservation Park. The track is 35km of Grade 3 (intermediate) mountain bike track and takes around 5 to 6 hours to complete for someone with medium to high level of fitness. Situated along the track are three huts, Skips, Rogers and Moerangi. All three spots are a good stopping point for riders or a place to stay on an overnight ride.

It was first published in 1910, and has almost always been in print ever since. Plot introduction Henry Handel Richardson was the pseudonym of Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson, a writer who was born in 1870 to a reasonably well-off family which later fell on hard times. The author's family lived in various Victorian towns and from the age of 13 to 17 Richardson attended boarding school at the Presbyterian Ladies' College in Melbourne, Victoria. It's this experience that feeds directly into The Getting of Wisdom. Laura Tweedle Rambotham, the main character, is the eldest child of a country family. She is a clever and highly imaginative child, given to inventing romantic stories for the entertainment of her younger siblings, and an avid reader. She is also both proud and sensitive and her mother finds her difficult to handle. Her mother is the widow of a barrister who supports her family in genteel poverty on her earnings from embroidery. At the age of twelve Laura is sent off to boarding school in Melbourne. Her experiences at school shock and humiliate the unworldly Laura. The girls at the school are generally from rather wealthy families and those, like Laura, who come from less fortunate backgrounds learn very early not to divulge their circumstances for fear of ridicule. From time to time Laura lets little snippets of information about her family slip out, and she suffers for it. In fact, these seem to be the main forces controlling the action of this book: fear of the judgements of one's peers, the desire to \\"fit in\\", embarrassment about one's family‚Äîit is shameful to have a mother who works for a living‚Äîand the desire to \\"better\\" oneself by belittling others. None of the girls in the school, nor the teachers for that matter, come across as anything but self-serving and boorish. Even Laura, who starts out so young and strong and idealistic, surrenders to the role expected of her. Essentially, this is a story about the destruction of innocence. Laura undergoes a form of redemption at the end of the book, convincing herself that cheating in an exam is actually God's will, and then later deciding that while she was wrong to do so, she got away with it and therefore God had no actual hand in the matter or else he would have punished her for the sin. A neat case of self-delusion. At the end, when Laura is walking away from the school for the last time, she is overcome with a desire to run, and the last we see of her is a rapidly diminishing form disappearing through a park. She is free at last: free of the overwhelming constrictions of the school, the teachers' expectations and the other schoolgirls' callous disregard. Notes The book carries the dedication: \\"To my unnamed little collaborator\\". The epigraph reads: Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. Proverbs, IV, 7. Film adaptation In 1978, the book was adapted for the screen in a film of the same name.Internet Movie DataBase - The Getting of Wisdom (1978) The film version was directed by Bruce Beresford, from a screenplay by Eleanor Witcombe.

History The Bill for the Norwich & Brandon Railway (N&BR;) received Royal Assent on 10 May 1844. Work started on the line in 1844 and the line and its stations were opened on 30 July 1845. Hethersett station opened with the line and was situated east of Spink's Lane station and west of Trowse station. The line ran from Ely to Trowse, in Norwich. The link into Norwich was delayed due to the need to build a bridge over the River Wensum that kept the river navigable. One month before the N&BR; opened a Bill authorising the amalgamation of the Yarmouth & Norwich Railway with the N&BR; came into effect and so Hethersett station became a Norfolk Railway asset. Spink's Lane was closed in November 1845, so the next station west of Hethersett was Wymondham.C.J. Allen The NR closed Hethersett station in September 1847.RVJ Butt Five years later and four years after the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) took over the NR the new owners reopened Hethersett Station.RVJ Butt A decade after Hethersett reopened, the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the ECR, which wished to amalgamate formally but could not obtain government agreement for this until an Act of Parliament on 7 August 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed by the amalgamation. Hethersett became a GER station on 1 July 1862 when the GER took over the ECR. The GER amalgamated with other railways to form the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) on 1 January 1923, so Hethersett became a LNER station.

Following closure, the platforms were removed and the station building stood derelict for many years. It has now been restored and is an industrial premises.

The structure of the individual zooids is generally simple, a box-like chamber of calcium carbonate, the polypides reaching out through an uncalcified flexible frontal wall, often surrounded by numerous spines. Like in other gymnolaematans, their lophophore is protruded by muscles that pull on the frontal wall of the zooid. In some treatments, the Flustrina are restricted to the superfamilies Calloporoidea and Flustroidea and ranked as infraorder alongside the Cellulariomorpha which contain the other three superfamilies.

Biography Born in Grove City, Pennsylvania, Kubek grew up in the Dallas, Texas area. In the 1970s during his teen years, he played with the likes of Freddie King and in the 1980s began performing with Louisiana-born musician and vocalist, Bnois King. In 1985, Kubek released his first record on Bird Records, a 45 RPM single with the tracks \\"Driving Sideways\\" (written by Freddie King and Sonny Thompson) and \\"Other Side Of Love\\" (written by Doyle Bramhall Sr.). The single's executive producers were Clint Birdwell and Charley Wirz. The two tracks reappeared on Kubek's 2012 album, Let That Right Hand Go, produced by Birdwell and issued on Birdwell's label, Bird Records Texas. The album is a collection of mostly unreleased material recorded since the 1980s (with the 1985 single's track, \\"Other Side Of Love\\", entitled \\"The Other Side Of Love\\"). In 1991, Kubek released his first full-length album, entitled Steppin' Out Texas Style (Bullseye Blues Records), and later released over a dozen albums on various labels.

She also published a number of important genealogical books. Born Annie Elizabeth Morrill, she was a daughter of Cynthia (Langdon) and Henry Edwin Morrill, M.D. She was educated at Packer Collegiate Institute, and in 1880 married Hugh Montgomery Smith, a physician who died unexpectedly in 1897. When she was young, Annie Morrill Smith had studied botany abroad, and became interested in bryophytes and lichens. She was acquainted with Elizabeth Gertrude Britton and Abel Joel Grout, cofounders of the Sullivant Moss Society. After her husband died, she became associate editor of The Bryologist, the publication of the Society. In 1905, she became the formal editor and served in this role until 1911. During this time she used much of her personal wealth to keep the Society solvent. She served as treasurer of the Society for 10 years; she was vice president for seven years; and president for two years. She also published several genealogical books, including From One Generation To Another (1906) about the Langdon family, Morrill Kindred in America (1914) about the Morrills, and Ancestors of Henry Montgomery Smith and Catherine Forshee (1921).

Hartree assumed that the nucleus together with the electrons formed a spherically symmetric field. The charge distribution of each electron was the solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation for an electron in a potential v(r) , derived from the field. Self- consistency required that the final field, computed from the solutions was self-consistent with the initial field and he called his method the self- consistent field method.  History  In order to solve the equation of an electron in a spherical potential, Hartree first introduced atomic units to eliminate physical constants. Then he converted the Laplacian from Cartesian to spherical coordinates to show that the solution was a product of a radial function P(r)/r and a spherical harmonic with an angular quantum number \\\\ell, namely \\\\psi=(1/r)P(r)S_\\\\ell(\\\\theta,\\\\phi). The equation for the radial function was :d^2P(r)/dr^2 + [2(E-v(r)) - \\\\ell(\\\\ell+1)/r^2]P(r)=0.  Hartree equation in mathematics  In mathematics, the Hartree equation, named after Douglas Hartree, is :i\\\\,\\\\partial_tu + abla^2 u= V(u)u in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d+1} where :V(u)= \\\\pm x^{-n} * u^2 and : 0 < n < d The non-linear Schr√∂dinger equation is in some sense a limiting case.  Hartree product  The wavefunction which describes all of the electrons, \\\\Psi, is almost always too complex to calculate directly. Hartree's original method was to first calculate the solutions to Schr√∂dinger's equation for individual electrons 1, 2, 3,... in the states \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma..., which we come up with individual solutions: \\\\psi_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\mathbf{x}_1), \\\\psi_{\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{x}_2), \\\\psi_{\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{x}_3), ...\\\\psi_{\\\\pi}(\\\\mathbf{x}_p) Since each \\\\psi is a solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation by itself, their product should at least approximate a solution. This simple method of combining the wavefunctions of the individual electrons is known as the Hartree product: : \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{x}_1,\\\\mathbf{x}_2,\\\\mathbf{x}_3,...\\\\mathbf{x}_p) = \\\\psi_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\mathbf{x}_1)\\\\psi_{\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{x}_2)\\\\psi_{\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{x}_3)...\\\\psi_{\\\\pi}(\\\\mathbf{x}_p) This Hartree product gives us a system (many-particle) wavefunction, as a combination of wavefunctions of the individual particle wavefunctions. It is inherently mean-field (assumes the particles are independent) and is the unsymmetrized version of the Slater determinant ansatz in the Hartree‚ÄìFock method. Although it has the advantage of simplicity, the Hartree product is not satisfactory for fermions, such as electrons, because the resulting wave function is not antisymmetric. An antisymmetric wave function can be mathematically described using the Slater determinant.  Derivation  Let's start from a Hamiltonian of one atom with Z electrons, the same method with some modifications can be expanded to a mono atomic crystal using the Born‚Äìvon Karman boundary condition and to a crystal with a basis. : \\\\hat {H} = - \\\\frac {\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\sum_{i}{ abla^2}_{\\\\mathbf{r}_i} - \\\\sum_{i}\\\\frac{Ze^2}{4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\mathbf{r}_i}+\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i eq j}\\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\mathbf{r}_i-\\\\mathbf{r}_j} The expectation value is given by : \\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\hat{H}\\\\psi\\\\rangle= \\\\int \\\\psi^{*}(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,s_1,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_Z,s_Z)\\\\hat{H}\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,s_1,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_Z,s_Z)\\\\prod_i d\\\\mathbf{r}_i Where the s_i are the spins of the different particles. In general we approximate this potential with a mean field which is also unknown and needs to be found together with the eigenfunctions of the problem. We will also neglect all relativistic effects like spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions.  Hartree derivation  At the time of Hartree the full Pauli exclusion principle was not yet invented, it was only clear the exclusion principle in terms of quantum numbers but it was not clear that the wave function of electrons shall be anti-symmetric. If we start from the assumption that the wave functions of each electron are independent we can assume that the total wave function is the product of the single wave functions and that the total charge density at position \\\\mathbf{r} due to all electrons except i is : \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) = -e \\\\sum_{i eq j}  \\\\phi_{n_j}(\\\\mathbf{r})^2 Where we neglected the spin here for simplicity. This charge density creates an extra mean potential: : abla^2 V(\\\\mathbf{r}) = - \\\\frac{\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r})}{\\\\epsilon_0} The solution can be written as the coulomb integral : V(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0} \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r'})}{\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r'} } d\\\\mathbf{r'} = - \\\\frac{e}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0}\\\\sum_{i eq j} \\\\int \\\\frac{ \\\\phi_{n_j}(\\\\mathbf{r})^2}{\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r'} } d\\\\mathbf{r'} If we now consider the electron i this will also satisfy the time independent Schroedinger equation : \\\\left[-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar abla^2}{2m} - \\\\frac{Ze^2}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\mathbf{r}} -e V(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\right] \\\\phi_{n_i} = \\\\Epsilon_i \\\\phi_{n_i} This is interesting on its own because it can be compared with a single particle problem in a continuous medium where the dielectric constant is given by: : \\\\varepsilon(\\\\mathbf{r})=\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_0}{1 + \\\\frac {4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0}{Ze} \\\\mathbf{r}V(\\\\mathbf{r})} Where V(\\\\mathbf{r})<0 and \\\\varepsilon(\\\\mathbf{r}) > \\\\epsilon_0 Finally we have the system of Hartree equations : \\\\left[-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar abla^2}{2m} - \\\\frac{Ze^2}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\mathbf{r}} + \\\\frac{e}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0}\\\\sum_{i eq j} \\\\int \\\\frac{ \\\\phi_{n_j}(\\\\mathbf{r})^2}{\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r'} } d\\\\mathbf{r'} \\\\right] \\\\phi_{n_i} = \\\\Epsilon_i \\\\phi_{n_i} This is a non linear system of integro- differential equations, but it is interesting in a computational setting cause we can solve them iteratively. Namely we start from a set of known eigen- functions (which in this simplified mono-atomic example can be the ones of the hydrogen atom) and starting initially from the potential V(\\\\mathbf{r})=0 computing at each iteration a new version of the potential from the charge density above and then a new version of the eigen-functions, ideally these iterations converge. From the convergence of the potential we can say we have a \\"self consistent\\" mean field, i.e. a continuous variation from a known potential with known solutions to an averaged mean field potential, in that sense the potential is consistent and not so different from the originally used one as ansatz.  Slater‚ÄìGaunt derivation  In 1928 J. C. Slater and J. A. Gaunt independently showed that Given the Hartree product approximation: : \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,s_1,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_Z,s_Z) = \\\\prod_i^Z \\\\phi_{n_i}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i,s_i) They started from the following variational condition : \\\\delta\\\\left( \\\\langle \\\\prod_i \\\\phi_{n_i}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i,s_i)\\\\hat{H}\\\\prod_i \\\\phi_{n_i}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i,s_i) \\\\rangle - \\\\sum_i \\\\epsilon_i \\\\langle\\\\phi_{n_i}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i,s_i)\\\\phi_{n_i}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i,s_i)\\\\rangle\\\\right) = 0 where the \\\\epsilon_i are the Lagrange multipliers needed in order to minimize the functional of the mean energy \\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\hat{H}\\\\psi\\\\rangle. The orthogonal conditions acts as constraints in the scope of the lagrange multipliers. From here they managed to derive the Hartree equations.  Fock and Slater determinant approach  In 1930 Fock and Slater independently then used the slater determinant instead of the Hartree product for the wave function : \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,s_1,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_Z,s_Z) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{Z!}} det \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\phi_{n_1}(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,s_1) & \\\\phi_{n_1}(\\\\mathbf{r}_2,s_2) & ... & \\\\phi_{n_1}(\\\\mathbf{r}_Z,s_Z) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\phi_{n_2}(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,s_1) & \\\\phi_{n_2}(\\\\mathbf{r}_2,s_2) & ... & \\\\phi_{n_2}(\\\\mathbf{r}_Z,s_Z) \\\\\\\\\\\\ ... & ... & ... & ...\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\phi_{n_Z}(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,s_1) & \\\\phi_{n_Z}(\\\\mathbf{r}_2,s_2) & ... & \\\\phi_{n_Z}(\\\\mathbf{r}_Z,s_Z)\\\\end{bmatrix} This determinant guarantees the exchange symmetry (i.e. if the two columns are swapped the determinant change sign) and the pauli principle if two electronic states are identical there are two identical rows and therefore the determinant is zero. They then applied the same variational condition as above : \\\\delta\\\\left( \\\\langle \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_i,s_i)\\\\hat{H}\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_i,s_i) \\\\rangle - \\\\sum_i \\\\epsilon_i \\\\langle\\\\phi_{n_i}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i,s_i)\\\\phi_{n_i}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i,s_i)\\\\rangle\\\\right) = 0 Where now the \\\\phi_{n_i} are a generic orthogonal set of eigen-functions \\\\langle \\\\phi_{n_i}(\\\\mathbf{r},s_i)\\\\phi_{n_j}(\\\\mathbf{r},s_j)\\\\rangle=\\\\delta_{ij} from which the wave function is built. The orthogonal conditions acts as constraints in the scope of the lagrange multipliers. From this they derived the Hartree‚ÄìFock method.

Between December 1911 and January 1912, both Roald Amundsen (leading his South Pole expedition) and Robert Falcon Scott (leading the Terra Nova Expedition) reached the South Pole within five weeks of each other. But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the geographic south pole first and subsequently return to their base camp at Framheim without loss of human life, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition. The contrasting fates of the two teams seeking the same prize at the same time invites comparison.  Overview  The outcomes of the two expeditions were as follows. *Priority at the South Pole: Amundsen beat Scott to the South Pole by 34 days. *Fatalities: Scott lost five men including himself returning from the pole, out of a team of 65. Amundsen's entire team of 19 returned to Norway safely. *Some authors (including Huntford and Fiennes) associate up to two further deaths (the drowning of Robert Brissenden and the suicide of Hjalmar Johansen) with the two expeditions, but these happened outside the Antarctic Circle. Historically, several factors have been discussed and many contributing factors claimed, including: * Priority at the pole: Scott wrote that Amundsen's dogs seriously threatened his own polar aspirations, because dogs, being more cold-tolerant than ponies, would be able to start earlier in the season than Scott's mixed transport of dogs, ponies, and motors.Scott's diary, 22 Feb 1911 \\"The proper, as well as wiser, course for us is to proceed exactly as though this had not happened. To go forward and do our best for the honour of the country without fear or panic. There is no doubt that Amundsen's plan is a serious menace to ours. He has a shorter distance to the Pole by 60 miles‚Äî I never thought he could have got so many dogs safely to the ice. His plan for running them seems excellent. But above all he can start his journey early in the season‚Äîan impossible condition with ponies.\\" * Cherry-Garrard in The Worst Journey in the World agreed but added that in his experience, dogs would not have been able to ascend the Beardmore Glacier.Apsley Cherry Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World, chapter 19 \\"The practical man of the world has plenty of criticism of the way things were done. He says dogs should have been taken [to the Polar Plateau], but he does not show how they could have been got up and down the Beardmore [Glacier].\\" * With regards to the causes of the deaths of Scott and his companions, Cherry-Garrard devotes chapter 19 in his book to examine the causes. Among several other factors, he surmised that the rations of Scott's team were inadequate and did not provide enough energy for the men.Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World ‚Äì Antarctic 1910‚Äì13, Chapter XIX, page 573. * Much of Scott's hauling was to be done by ponies, which are ill-suited to work on snow and ice without snow-shoes. Their relatively small hooves and large weight caused them to sink into anything other than very firm snow or ice. Oates was opposed to snow- shoes and had left most of them at base camp. * Ponies' coats easily became soaked with perspiration during exertion, thus necessitating constant attention with blankets to avoid hypothermia through evaporation. Dogs in contrast do not have sweat glands‚Äîthey cool themselves via panting, making them less vulnerable to the cold. With ponies, Scott acknowledged he could not depart until 1 November 1911 when the weather would be warmer, leaving him less time to complete the journey. * The loss of ponies, several of which had drowned on disintegrating sea-ice, limited the supplies that could be hauled to the depots. Of 19 ponies brought south to aid in laying depots on the Ross Ice Shelf (traversed during the first and final quarters of the trek) nine were lost before the journey began. Further, unlike dogs which could eat the abundant seal and penguin meat found in Antarctica, the ponies' food had to be carried forward from the ship, vastly increasing the stores that had to be transported as Scott's expedition moved towards the pole. * Had the one-ton depot been placed at latitude 80¬∞ S., as planned, Scott and his two surviving companions could have reached it on their return march. Instead, because Scott refused to drive the ponies to their deaths, despite Oates' urgent advice to do so, the depot was placed some 31 miles short of there. Scott's party died 11 miles south of the depot. * The last-minute addition of Lieutenant Henry R. Bowers to the planned four-man pole party may have strained the rationing plan, although the death of Petty Officer Evans weeks later reduced the party to four again. * The rations were deficient in B and C vitamins. The party became weaker a few weeks after reaching the pole, despite Scott's racing ambitions before the return march, writing \\"Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first [before Amundsen reaches the cablehead in Australia]. I wonder if we can do it.\\" * The tins of cooking fuel cached along the return route were found to be partly empty, which forced the men to eat frozen food. Shortage of fuel to melt water likely caused the men to become dehydrated. Apparently the heat of the sun had vaporised part of the fuel, enabling it to escape past the cork stoppers. Amundsen knew about this \\"creep\\", and had had the fuel tins soldered shut on the voyage to Antarctica, see below. * The weather on the return march seems to have been unusually bad. In particular, when the party reached the Great Ice Barrier, the temperature was much lower than expected for the season, making the surface much less suitable for the sledge runners. Furthermore, the tailwind which they had expected to aid them home did not appear. Scott wrote, in his final \\"Message to the Public\\": \\"...our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather....\\" * The complexity of the transportation plan made it vulnerable. It depended in part on motor-sledges, ponies, dogs, and southerly winds to assist the sledges (which were fitted with sails). Half of the distance was intended to be covered by man-hauling (and sails whenever conditions permitted). Scott's daily marches were limited to the endurance of the slowest team, the man-haulers who were instructed to advance 15 miles a day. The ponies marched by night and rested when the sun was warmer, Meares remained idle in camp with the much faster dogs for many hours, before catching up at the end of the day.E.G.R.G. Evans South With Scott. Collins London 1953 p184 Sullivan states that it was the last factor that probably was decisive. He states:  Objectives of the expeditions  Scott and his financial backers saw the expedition as having a scientific basis, while also wishing to reach the pole. However, it was recognised by all involved that the South Pole was the primary objective (\\"The Southern Journey involves the most important object of the Expedition\\" ‚Äì Scott), and had priority in terms of resources, such as the best ponies and all the dogs and motor sledges as well as involvement of the vast majority of the expedition personnel. Scott and his team knew the expedition would be judged on his attainment of the pole (\\"The ... public will gauge the result of the scientific work of the expedition largely in accordance with the success or failure of the main object\\" ‚Äì Scott). He was prepared to make a second attempt the following year (1912‚Äì13) if this attempt failed and had Indian Army mules and additional dogs delivered in anticipation. In fact the mules were used by the team that discovered the dead bodies of Scott, Henry Robertson Bowers, and Edward Adrian Wilson in November 1912, but proved even less useful than the ponies, according to Cherry-Garrard. Amundsen's expedition was planned to reach the South Pole. This was a plan he conceived in 1909.The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, , Volume I, Chapter II, page 53. Amundsen's expedition did conduct geographical work under Kristian Prestrud who conducted an expedition to King Edward VII Land while Amundsen was undertaking his attempt at the pole.  Base camps  Amundsen camped on the Ross Ice Shelf at the Bay of Whales at approx. 78¬∞30‚Ä≤S, which is 52 nautical miles (96 km) closer to the pole than Scott's camp (at 77¬∞38‚Ä≤S) which was 350 nautical miles west of Amundsen, on Ross Island. Amundsen had deduced that, as the Trans-Antarctic Mountains ran northwest to southeast then if he were to meet a mountain range on his route then the time spent at the high altitude of the Antarctic plateau would be less than Scott's.The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, , Volume I, Chapter II, page 47. Scott's base was at Cape Evans on Ross Island, with access to the Trans- Antarctic mountain range to the west, and was a better base for geological exploration. He had based his previous expedition in the same area. However, he knew it to be poor as a route to the pole as he had to start before sea ice melted and had suffered delay in returning while waiting for the sea ice to freeze. They also had to make detours around Ross Island and its known crevassed areas which meant a longer journey. The crossing of the Ross Ice Shelf was an onerous task for the ponies. Scott had advanced considerable stores across the ice shelf the year before to allow the ponies to carry lighter loads over the early passage across the ice. Even so, he had to delay the departure of the ponies until 1 November rather than 24 October when the dogs and motor sledges set off.E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p153 Consequently, the Motor Party spent 6 days at the Mount Hooper Depot waiting for Scott to arrive.E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p184  Methods of transport  = Motor sledges = William Lashly by a motor sledge in November 1911. The major comparison between Scott and Amundsen has focused on the choice of draft transport ‚Äîdog versus pony/man-hauling. In fact Scott took dogs, ponies and three \\"motor sledges\\". Scott spent nearly seven times the amount of money on his motor sledges than on the dogs and horses combined. They were therefore a vital part of the expedition. Unfortunately, Scott decided to leave behind the engineer, Lieutenant Commander Reginald William SkeltonLetter to Capt Scott, R W Skelton, 7 April 1910. who had created and trialled the motor sledges. This was due to the selection of Lieutenant E.R.G.R. \\"Teddy\\" Evans as the expedition's second in command. As Evans was junior in rank to Skelton, he insisted that Skelton could not come on the expedition. Scott agreed to this request and Skelton's experience and knowledge were lost.Letter to R W Skeltonj from Capt Scott, 21 March 1910. One of the original three motor sledges was a failure even before the expedition set out; the heavy sledge was lost through thin ice on unloading it from the ship. The two remaining motor sledges failed relatively early in the main expedition because of repeated faults. Skelton's experience might have been valuable in overcoming the failures.Scott's Last Expedition, entry 17 Oct 1911, page 335 as an example. = Ponies vs dogs = Terra Nova's sled dogs. The ponies in the stable, March 28th 1911. Scott had used dogs on his first (Discovery) expedition and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow with the use of dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them. As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down. Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate. The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds. Scott's opinion was reinforced by Shackleton's experience on the Nimrod expedition, which got to within of the pole. Shackleton used ponies. Scott planned to use ponies only to the base of the Beardmore Glacier (one- quarter of the total journey) and man-haul the rest of the journey. Scott's team had developed snow shoes for his ponies, and trials showed they could significantly increase daily progress. However, Lawrence Oates, whom Scott had made responsible for the ponies, was reluctant to use the snow shoes and Scott failed to insist on their use. There was plenty of evidence that dogs could succeed in the achievements of William Speirs Bruce in his Arctic, Antarctic, and Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, Amundsen in the Gj√∏a North West passage expedition, Fridtjof Nansen's crossing of Greenland, Robert Peary's three attempts at the North Pole, Eivind Astrup's work supporting Peary, Frederick Cook's discredited North Pole expedition, and Otto Sverdrup's explorations of Ellesmere Island. Moreover, Scott ignored the direct advice he received (while attending trials of the motor sledges in Norway) from Nansen, the most famous explorer of the day, who told Scott to take \\"dogs, dogs and more dogs\\".Letter to Sir Clements Markham from Fridtjof Nansen, 4 April 1913. At the time of the events, the expert view in England had been that dogs were of dubious value as a means of Antarctic transport. Broadly speaking, Scott saw two ways in which dogs may be used‚Äîthey may be taken with the idea of bringing them all back safe and sound, or they may be treated as pawns in the game, from which the best value is to be got regardless of their lives. He stated that if, and only if, the comparison was made with a dog sledge journey which aimed to preserve the dogs' lives, 'I am inclined to state my belief that in the polar regions properly organised parties of men will perform as extended journeys as teams of dogs.' On the other hand, if the lives of the dogs were to be sacrificed, then 'the dog-team is invested with a capacity for work which is beyond the emulation of men. To appreciate this is a matter of simple arithmetic'. But efficiency notwithstanding, he expressed \\"reluctance\\" to use dogs in this way: \\"One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions.\\" Amundsen, by contrast, took an entirely utilitarian approach. Amundsen planned from the start to have weaker animals killed to feed the other animals and the men themselves. He expressed the opinion that it was less cruel to feed and work dogs correctly before shooting them, than it would be to starve and overwork them to the point of collapse. Amundsen and his team had similar affection for their dogs as those expressed above by the English, but they \\"also had agreed to shrink from nothing in order to achieve our goal\\".The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, , Volume II, Chapter XI, page 62-63. The British thought such a procedure was distasteful, though they were willing to eat their ponies. Amundsen had used the opportunity of learning from the Inuit while on his Gj√∏a North West passage expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To make the most of the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey,Diary, Olav Bjaaland, entry 12 November 1911. and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the Antarctic while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11. What Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, if it is to do the same work as a man, will require the same amount of food. Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given insufficient food they become difficult to handle. The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility. Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them. = Walking vs skiing on snow = Amundsen on skis, March 7th, 1909. Scott took the Norwegian pilot and skier Tryggve Gran to the Antarctic on the recommendation of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party. Gran (possibly because he was Norwegian) was not included in the South Pole party, which could have made a difference. Gran was, one year later, the first to locate the deceased Scott and his remaining companions in their tent just some 18 km (11 miles) short of One Ton depot, that might have saved their lives had they reached it. Scott would subsequently complain in his diary, while well into his journey and therefore too late to take any corrective action and after over 10 years since the Discovery expedition, that \\"Skis are the thing, and here are my tiresome fellow countrymen too prejudiced to have prepared themselves for the event\\".Scott's Last Expedition, entry 11 Dec 1911, page 388. Amundsen, on his side, recruited a team of well experienced skiers, all Norwegians who had skied from an early age. He also recruited a champion skier, Olav Bjaaland, as the front runner. The Amundsen party gained weight on their return travel from the South Pole.  Weather conditions  Scott and Shackleton's experience in 1903 and 1907 gave them first-hand experience of average conditions in Antarctica. Simpson, Scott's meteorologist 1910‚Äì1912, charted the weather during their expedition, often taking two readings a day. On their return to the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's group experienced prolonged low temperatures from 27 February until 10 March which have only been matched once in 15 years of current records. The exceptional severity of the weather meant they failed to make the daily distances they needed to get to the next depot. This was a serious position as they were short of fuel and food. When Scott, Wilson, and Bowers died (Petty Officer Edgar Evans and Lawrence Oates had died earlier during the return from the South Pole) they were short of One-Ton Depot, which was from Corner Camp, where they would have been safe. On the other hand, Cherry-Garrard had travelled nearly in the same area, during the same time period and same temperatures, using a dog team.Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World ‚Äì Antarctic 1910‚Äì13, Chapter XIII, dates 19 Feb to 15 Mar 1912, page 420‚Äì428. Scott also blamed \\"a prolonged blizzard\\". But while there is evidence to support the low temperatures, there is only evidence for a \\"normal\\" two- to four-day blizzard, and not the ten days that Scott claims.  Route marking and depot laying  One of Amundsen's depots. During depot laying in February 1911, Roald Amundsen had his first (and last) of his route marked like a Norwegian ski course using marker flags initially every eight miles. He added to this by using food containers painted black, resulting in a marker every mile. From 82 degrees on, Amundsen built a cairn every three miles with a note inside recording the cairn's position, the distance to the next depot, and direction to the next cairn.The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, , Volume II, Chapter X, page 22. In order not to miss a depot considering the snow and great distances, Amundsen took precautions. Each depot laid out up to 85 degrees (laid out every degree of latitude) had a line of bamboo flags laid out transversely every half-mile for five miles on either side of the depot, ensuring that the returning party could locate the designated depot. Scott relied on depots much less frequently laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes were marked by the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots.Scott's Last Expedition, entry 25 and 26 Jan 1912, page 431 and entry 12 and 13 Feb 1912, page 443 as examples. It is also clear that Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they would have been able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.  Food and fuel  Evans, Bower, Wilson and Scott have a meal. By the time they arrived at the pole, the health of Scott's team had significantly deteriorated, whereas Amundsen's team actually gained weight during the expedition. Although Scott's team managed to maintain the scheduled pace for most of the return leg, and hence was virtually always on full rations, their condition continued to worsen rapidly. (The only delay occurred when they were held for four days by a blizzard, and had to open their summit rations early as a consequence.Scott's Last Expedition, entry 7 Dec 1911, page 381.) Apsley Cherry-Garrard in his analysis of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained only a little more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges. A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the BBC, confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members.Jasper Rees, Blizzard ‚Äì Race to the pole, BBC Books 2006, . The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely. Scott's calculations for the supply requirements were based on a number of expeditions, both by members of his team (e.g., Wilson's trip with Cherry-Garrard and Bowers to the Emperor penguin colony which had each man on a different type of experimental ration), and by Shackleton. Apparently, Scott didn't take the strain of prolonged man-hauling at high altitudes sufficiently into account. Since the rations contained no B and C vitamins, the only source of these vitamins during the trek was from the slaughter of ponies or dogs. This made the men progressively malnourished, manifested most clearly in the form of scurvy. Scott also had to fight with a shortage of fuel due to leakage from stored fuel cans which used leather washers. This was a phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his fuel cans soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full. Dehydration may also have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to better planning and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt as much water as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.  Clothing and goggles  Amundsen in fur. Scott in polar gear, April 13th, 1911. Present-day explorer Ranulph Fiennes and others have asserted that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing and that Amundsen's, because they were skiing, was appropriately dressed in furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity, yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold. Amundsen's team did initially have problems with their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made before it was too late. Scott's team suffered regularly from snow blindness and sometimes this affected over half the team at any one time.Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World ‚Äì Antarctic 1910‚Äì13, Chapter X, entry for 10 Dec, page 367 as an example. By contrast, there was no recorded case of snow blindness during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the \\"day\\" (when the sun was in front of them) and travelled during the \\"night\\" (when the sun was behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.  Delay in meeting Scott's returning party  In 1921, 'Teddy' Evans wrote in his book South with Scott that Scott had left the following written orders at Cape Evans. He did however place a lesser importance upon this journey than that of replenishing the food rations at One Ton Depot. He continued his instructions in the next paragraph \\"You will of course understand that whilst the object of your third journey is important, that of the second is vital. At all hazards three X.S. units of provision must be got to One Ton Camp by the date named (19th January), and if the dogs are unable to perform this task, a man party must be organised.\\"Evans, E.R.G.R. 1953 South With Scott London Collins p = 173 with that qualification he closed his notes regarding his instructions for the dogs. Expedition member Apsley Cherry-Garrard did not mention Scott's order in his 1922 book The Worst Journey in the World. However, in the 1948 preface to his book, he discusses Scott's order. Cherry- Garrard writes that he and Edward Atkinson reached Cape Evans on 28 January. Scott had estimated Atkinson would reach camp by 13 January. Atkinson, now the senior officer discovered that the dog handler Cecil Meares had resigned from the expedition and that neither Meares nor anyone else had resupplied dog food to the depots. Cherry-Garrard also wrote \\"In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February\\". On 13 February, Atkinson set off on the first lap southwards to Hut Point with the dog assistant, Dimitri Gerov, and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were still at Hut Point when, on 19 February, Tom Crean arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt Edward Evans was lying seriously ill in a tent some to the south, and in urgent need of rescue.Evans, Lashly, and Crean had formed the final Support Party which had left Scott on 3 January. Lashly had stayed on the Barrier to nurse Evans while Crean walked to Hut Point. Both were awarded Albert (lifesaving) medals Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority, and set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved; the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February. Atkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected Apsley Cherry-Garrard. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to \\"use his judgement\\" as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton Depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov, after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party. On the return journey from the pole, Scott reached the 82.30¬∞S meeting point for the dog teams three days ahead of schedule, around 27 February 1912. Scott's diary for that day notes \\"We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt.\\" By 10 March it became clear that the dog teams were not coming: \\"The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble.\\" Around 25 March, awaiting death in his tent at latitude 79.40¬∞S, Scott speculated, in a farewell letter to his expedition treasurer Sir Edgar Speyer, that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing \\"We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support.\\" (Farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, cited from Karen May 2012.)  Other reasons for Scott's failure  = Geology samples= Scott's team continued to haul over 14 kg (30 lb) of rock samples. This would appear to be a major handicap when pulling a sledge in a race against the weather and a shortage of food and fuel. Scott could have left the samples at one of the cairns along the way to be picked up later. However, Ranulph Fiennes has suggested that the extra weight would not have been a major handicap.Captain Scott, Ranulph Fiennes, -page 249. Tryggve Gran on the other hand thought \\"they might have saved themselves the bother\\".Diary, Tryggve Gran, entry 23 Nov 1912, quoted Last Place on Earth, Roland Huntford, , page 556. = Final five-man team= Scott's planning, equipment and rations had been based on three sledge teams of four men ascending the Beardmore, with a team turning back every 10 days or so as rations required finally leaving one four-man team to attempt the pole. At the last moment when down to two teams (Scott's and Evans's) Scott decided to send a returning party of three, and take on five. This increased the cooking time for the team of five and affected the fuel supply.Scott's Last Expedition, entry 5 Jan 1912, page 414. It also meant the Evans party of three had to try to split the ration pack (at a time when they were cold and tired and later when one member was suffering from scurvy) to leave an allowance for the fifth man in Scott's party. This also will have affected the seepage of fuel from cans which were opened and then re-closed and left for several weeks before Scott's team got to them. Moreover, for some unexplained reason Scott had ordered Evans's team to cache their skis a week before so Bowers (the fifth man) walked to the pole and back to the cached skis (360 miles) while the rest of Scott's team skied. = Misuse of the dog team= For no clear reason Scott took the dogs on 140 miles further than originally planned. This meant killing the ponies early (and starting man-hauling earlier) to feed the dogs for no obvious benefit to the overall expedition. Scott also gave conflicting and changing orders for their use to each returning party. It was only in late February 1912 that it was discovered that the final supplies needed by Scott's returning party had not been delivered to One Ton Depot. Cherry-Garrard was sent with these supplies on 25 February 1912 and he was relieved to discover that he had beaten Scott's team to the depot. He also found that promised supplies of dog food were not in place. Cherry-Garrard remained at the depot, within of Scott, 4‚Äì10 March 1912 when he could possibly have saved Scott, Wilson, Bowers, and Oates if the management of the dog team had been better. = Navigation= Amundsen's crew taking an observation. Evans with a theodolite. Amundsen used prepared navigation sheets that simplified the calculations for his team when they were tired and cold. Four out of his team of five were qualified navigators. Amundsen's expedition also used a sextant during the journey, which is a relatively light and simple piece of equipment. He also attended a symposium that reviewed how to fix position at high latitudes. Scott used a theodolite which is heavier and requires more mental arithmetic. Scott also lacked navigators having only one per team. Scott dismissed Cherry-Garrard's request for navigational training and Wilson only attempted to learn how to read latitudes at the last moment. =Camp routine= Amundsen used canisters that left his sledges permanently lashed and loaded. Scott's team had to unload, and load and relash their sledge at every camp, no matter what the weather.

Parentage  She was born circa 1780 the daughter of High Chiefess Kaliko ªokalani. Genealogists disagree over who was Kaoanaeha's father due to her mother's two marriages. Most say she was the daughter of High Chief Keli ªimaika ªi (The Good Chief) who was the only full-blood brother of Kamehameha I, being the son of Ke≈çua and Keku ªiapoiwa II. Some say her father was High Chief Kalaipaihala, son of Kalani ª≈çpu ªu, King of Hawaii and uncle of Kamehameha. King KalƒÅkaua and Queen Lili ªuokalani supports the later due to their conflict with Kaoanaeha's granddaughter Emma Na ªea who ran for Queen Regnant in the Royal Election of 1874. Keli ªimaika ªi accepted her as daughter and most say he was her true father. She was the only person allowed to see him at his deathbed. Fifty years after her death, a claim was brought by Robert William Wilcox that she was the daughter of Keaka, a low-ranking Tahitian chief, who came to the islands and married Kaliko ªokalani. This claim was brought up in an editorial to defame one of Ka ª≈çana ªeha's descendants.  Royal status  Because of her royal status, when she was born p≈´lo ªulo ªu or kapu sticks with tapa-covered balls on the ends were set up before her house and pahu heiau or kapu drums were beaten heralding her birth. Further confirmation of her high status was when her father Keliimaikai died in 1810, she was reportedly the only person allowed to enter his premises. One romantictised version of her meeting with English sailor John Young is similar to the story of Pocahontas and John Smith: > Young and Davis would have been killed had not Kaoanaeha, a high lady, > fallen in love with Young and by her intercession with the King saved the > lives of both sailors. Kaoanaeha was the most beautiful woman on the island > of Owhyhee (Hawaii) and was the admiration of all the sailors who visited > Karakakooa Bay (). She was the only daughter of Keliimaiki, the favorite > brother of the great King, Kamehameha I. John Young and Kaoanaeha were soon > married. King Kamehameha appreciated the superior talents of the white men > and made them high chiefs.  Death  In the last days of her life, she wished to stay in Kawaihae. She had been reluctant to go to Honolulu and probably knew that she would not return just as fifteen years before, her husband did not return. At sixty-two and too ill to be cured, she died in Rooke House on January 22, 1850. She was buried the next day on the palace grounds by the Royal Tomb, without any high ceremony. Some wondered why a chiefess of her status would be buried so quietly. The official Polynesian did not make much of her death either, devoting just a few lines to her obituary. One reason for the lack of respect indicated that she was \\"out of favor in the royal circle of Honolulu\\" partly because she preferred the traditional Hawaiian values, including the ancient religion, and had resisted Christianity and Westernization.

The exercise is believed by those who practice it to build explosiveness in the upper torso, which may help in sports such as tennis, swimming, baseball, track & field, hockey, golf, lacrosse, or boxing.The Russian Twist: Men's Fitness  Technique  To perform the Russian twist, first, one should sit on the floor with knees bent as in a \\"sit-up\\" position. The feet should be kept together and slightly above the ground or put under a stable surface. The torso should be kept straight with the back kept off the ground at a 45 degree angle. Arms should be held together away from the body in a straight fashion and hands kept locked together like a ball or one can hold a weight to increase the difficulty. Next, the arms should be swung from one side to another in a twisting motion, with each swing to a side counting as one repetition. The slower one moves the arms from side to side, the harder the exercise becomes, working the abdomen that much better. When moving one's arms during the exercise, it is crucial to not stop between repetitions or else one will lose the effect of working the abdomen. Constant breathing in and out during the exercise is important as one should not hold one's breath.Russian Twist There are also other variants of this exercise such as using a stability ball or with a barbell standing up. = Mason twist = The Mason twist is a more advanced (difficult) version of the Russian twist.

History Opened by the East Suffolk Railway, it subsequently joined the Great Eastern Railway, it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. It was then closed by the British Transport Commission.

She is chiefly remembered now for the catastrophic boiler explosion in 1893 that destroyed her and killed eight people on board. Design and Construction Annie Faxon was built at 1877 at Celilo, Oregon, and rebuilt 1887 at Texas Ferry, Washington. She was first owned by the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, and then by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company when the shareholders of O.S.N. sold their stock at a huge profit. Navigation on the Columbia River At that time, and for the entire operational life of this vessel, the Columbia River was not continuously navigable from Portland at tidewater. Instead the river was divided into reaches known as the lower, middle, and upper Columbia, each one separated by a long stretch of essentially unnavigable rapids. The reaches were like giant steps, and once a steamboat was built on a step, it could, with some danger, descend to a lower step by running the rapids. However, in general no steamboat could proceed up a step, although in some cases steamboats were dismantled and carried around the major rapids or smaller ones might be winched up by a line attached to the bank. Operations of Annie Faxon Annie Faxon ran on the top step, that is, the reach above Celilo Falls. She was one of the largest steamboats to operate on these route. Boats like Annie Faxon on the upper Columbia could navigate up the Snake River to Lewiston, Idaho, and even beyond.Mills, Randall V., Sternwheelers up Columbia  A Century of Steamboating in the Oregon Country, at 43, 83, and 205, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE (1977 reprint of 1947 ed.) Destruction wreck of the Annie Faxon after explosion On April 14, 1893, at 7:30 a.m., Annie Faxon was destroyed in a catastrophic boiler explosion. The boat was coming in for a landing with Captain Harry Baughman in command. Suddenly with no warning the boiler exploded and the upper works of the vessel were destroyed. Eight people were killed, including the bride of purser J.E. Tappen, who was blown into the river and drowned. The boat's pilot, Thomas McIntosh, had been beheaded by flying debris, and crewman William Kidd was blown to pieces. Captain Baughman, who had been standing next to pilot McIntosh, was blasted onto the shore, dazed and injured. Five crew members were killed: John McIntosh, Thomas McIntosh, William Kidd, Henry Bush, Pain Allen, George Farwell, and Scott McComb Marshall, Don, Oregon Shipwrecks, at 203, Binford and Mort, Portland, OR 1984 Cause of the explosion The cause of the explosion was later said to be the failure of a safety valve (called a \\"fusible plug\\") to blow when the water level in the boiler fell too low. Just how this occurred was not quite certain. The vessel had been recently inspected, and while she was 16 years old at the time, she had been rebuilt in 1887 just six years before. The curious thing about this explosion was that it seemed to fit a pattern of explosions occurring not while racing but rather just after or before the vessel was coming in for a landing, as in the case of the Gazelle and the Senator.Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing  A Hundred Years of Steam Navigation on the Waters of the West, at 27, 29, and 71, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, ID 1973 Wright, E.W., ed., Lewis & Dryden Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 197, Lewis & Dryden Printing Co., Portland, OR 1895 Notes Category:Maritime boiler explosions Category:Steamboats of Oregon Category:Steamboats of Washington (state) Category:Sternwheelers of Washington (state) Category:Steamboats of Idaho Category:Steamboats of the Columbia River Category:Steamboats of the Snake River Category:Oregon Steam Navigation Company ","title":"Annie Faxon"},{"id":"16759747","text":"Northfield railway station was located from Adelaide station.  History  The Northfield station dates back to 1857 as part of the Dry Creek-Stockade line. The station originally seems to have been located midway between Gawler Road (later Main North Road) and Briens Road and was probably pushed to the eastern side of Briens Road (near the intersection with Howard Road) around the time the Pooraka and Cavan railway stations were added to the line, circa 1913‚Äì1914. In 1961, the turntable was removed and the station was again relocated just to the western side of the road. This time it consisted of a single platform and shelter. At around the same time, the former terminus station, Stockade railway station (which was principally used to carry stone from quarries established behind the Yatala Labour Prison), was closed, and the area incorporated into the suburb of Northfield. In the 1980s, the State Transport Authority decided that it was uneconomical to continue to run trains on the now renamed Northfield line. The last train serviced Northfield on 29 May 1987, and the track was removed shortly after. The station was probably demolished in the 1990s or early 2000s. There is no evidence of the station left as the site is now a skate park and BMX track.

The character first appeared in the opening scenes as Michael Long, played by Larry Anderson in the beginning of the pilot.Knight Rider Region 1 DVDs (Season 1). Michael Long Born Michael Arthur Long on January 9, 1949 outside of Los Angeles, California, raised by a blue-collar working family. In the late 1960s, Long joined the Army, was part of the Green Berets, and spent three years in counter-intelligence work in Vietnam. He got captured at one point while on a mission in Vietnam, in which he was able to escape and fight his way out. Although he had escaped, he ended up getting a serious injury that required brain surgery, and a metal plate was inserted into his skull.Knight Rider Region 1 DVDs (Season 1): Knight of the Phoenix. After those years in Vietnam as an intelligence officer, Michael was discharged from the service, and arrived back in Los Angeles in the 1970s, presumably 1972. Later he joined the Los Angeles Police Department, starting as a patrolman, where he met his partner Muntzy. Also, once Michael's partner was Sergeant (later Lieutenant) Jim Courtney, whom Michael called his \\"second father during his LAPD rookie days,\\" whose daughter Stacy got injured during an illegal street race during Season 3 episode \\"Knights of the Fast Lane.\\" Michael was subsequently promoted to detective sergeant, and finally to detective lieutenant with the LAPD's 11th precinct, in which his badge number was 4262. He used to reside at 1834 Shoreborne Avenue, Wilmington, California, in the zip code 90744.Knight Rider Region 1 DVDs (Season 2): Episode 211 Knightmares. This was, presumably, in 1982. Michael Knight After 10 years on the force, during the night of August 8, 1982 ‚Äì while on special assignment from the LAPD as an undercover Security Guard for Consolidated Chemical Corporation in Las Vegas, Nevada for six months ‚Äì his long-time partner, Muntzy (Herbert Jefferson, Jr.), working undercover as a maintenance man, was killed by Security Guard Gray (Lance LeGault). In the pilot episode, police officer Michael Arthur Long (played by Larry Anderson) was betrayed by a female informant and nearly killed by a gunshot wound to the head by an industrial espionage expert named Tanya Walker (Phyllis Davis). A metal plate in Long's skull ‚Äì the result of the head injury, mentioned above, sustained during the Vietnam War ten years earlier ‚Äì deflected the round, which still inflicted serious facial damage. That same night Long was declared dead to the public and his medical care was taken over by the Foundation for Law And Government (FLAG). This part of the story is shown in the pilot, titled \\"Knight of the Phoenix\\" in syndication. The symbolism in this title is related to Michael's car, a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, the likes of which usually featured a giant decal on the hood depicting the fire bird (the Phoenix). The phoenix traditionally is symbolic of rebirth, and the scene of Long collapsing on the hood foreshadows later events. FLAG is a private crime-fighting arm of Knight Industries, an organization founded by Wilton Knight, a billionaire philanthropist. Michael was not Wilton Knight's first choice for the pilot program, but Wilton changed his mind and reopened the foundation due to Michael's arrival. In the context of the pilot, Wilton Knight (Richard Basehart) is dying of an undisclosed illness. Wilton picked up Michael passed out in front of his car, on a desert highway. Michael barely survived, thanks to the metal plate. Given a new face via facial reconstructive surgery, Long is resurrected as Michael Knight (now played by David Hasselhoff). Together with a high-tech automobile called the Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT), Michael Knight agrees to carry on Wilton Knight's crusade of aiding the powerless. He usually was given mission objectives by the new director of FLAG, Wilton Knight's longtime friend and confidant, Devon Miles (Edward Mulhare). Michael was selected for his high level of self-defense training, intelligence, law enforcement experience, and his ability and preference to work alone without assistance or back-up. Michael Knight was a special type of hero, a modern knight who avoided violence whenever possible and generally refrained from using firearms (although in several episodes he is seen with a .38 revolver and once with a MAC-10 when arresting some corrupt US Army troops). Although most of Knight's cases were based in Southern California, where FLAG was headquartered, the operation was not confined there. He could travel to whatever part of the country trouble arose in; sometimes even crossing borders into Mexico. FLAG also had facilities in Las Vegas and Chicago. The organization also owned a semi-trailer truck that served as a mobile office and also offered technical support for KITT. In early literature for the series, the aforementioned metal plate in Michael Long's forehead was also said to be used for Knight to pick up various radiowaves and signals. This was played upon in the several Knight Rider tie-in novels published, but was very seldom used in the actual series itself. One of the only questionable examples of it being utilized is in the first-season episode \\"Trust Doesn't Rust,\\" when Michael suddenly tells KITT to switch to the police frequency, although it is arguable that he could have just noticed local commotion, or been acting on a hunch. In the second-season episode \\"Soul Survivor,\\" KITT's CPU is separated from the car and deposited in a trash can in a garage; Michael finds it after telling Devon he senses KITT's essence. In addition to playing Michael Knight, Hasselhoff also played a double role in the Season Two feature-length episodes \\"Goliath\\" and \\"Goliath Returns\\", portraying not only Michael Knight but also Wilton's biological son, Garthe Knight. At the time of Michael's surgery, Garthe was imprisoned in Africa. Believing that his son would never be seen again, Wilton had Michael's face modeled after Garthe's.Knight Rider Region 1 DVDs (Season 2). In the pilot episode, both Devon Miles and Wilton stated that Michael actually resembled the face of Wilton himself as a young man. The novels written after the series aired described Michael's reconstructed face as based on images of both a young Wilton and Wilton's son. In any event, the Garthe storyline would not go beyond the second season, primarily due to Hasselhoff's request that the doppelg√§nger villain be ended, due to the time it took to be made up and film both the roles of Michael and Garthe. In 1984, Michael found out that the reason for his having almost been murdered two years before was his having been the target of a hit put out on Long by Tanya Walker's lover‚Äîand Wilton Knight's long-standing enemy‚ÄîCameron Zachary (acted out by John Vernon), which was the reason Michael was shot.Knight Rider Region 1 DVDs (Season 2): Episode 220 A Good Knight's Work. (In episode #47 of the two part \\"Knight of the Drones\\" it is revealed that prior to Michael Long/Knight that FLAG had a prospective \\"Knight\\" driver who was murdered; however, this was never mentioned in any other episode.) Michael is always a ladies' man, often loves women, and that included his former fianc√©e Stephanie \\"Stevie\\" March Mason (portrayed by Hasselhoff's actual wife at the time, Catherine Hickland), who eventually he marries (seen in the episode \\"Scent of Roses\\") on the same day she is killed.Knight Rider Region 1 DVDs (Season 4). Michael's favorite foods are often steak, eggs, greasy fried potatoes and burgers. He retired from FLAG in 1990. TKR would take over his duties. =Team Knight Rider= In the final episode of \\"Team Knight Rider\\" a mysterious man appears in the episode as a mysterious agent of FLAG known in most of the episode as the \\"Shadow\\". Kyle tells Trek that he suspects that Shadow is FLAG's most famous operative; he does not say the name, but implies Michael Knight. He explains that this operative never had an unsuccessful mission, but nobody knows what happened to him. At the end of the episode Team Knight Rider find a grave. The grave marker reads: \\"Michael Knight R.I.P. One man who made a difference\\". A man appears and tells them \\"I'm Michael Knight. Or at least I was.\\" =Knight Rider 2000= In a 1991 sequel movie Knight Rider 2000 Devon visits Michael and convinces him to join FLAG's project, the Knight 4000, as the test driver. But Michael is furious to discover that KITT has been disassembled. Michael is ready to walk away, but later decides to rebuild KITT's AI unit. At the end of the movie Michael returns to retirement. =Knight Rider (2008 TV series)= In the 2008 Knight Rider revival television movie, Michael Knight shows up at the funeral for his son's mother. He introduces himself to his estranged son, Michael Traceur, who asks if he will see Michael again. Michael replies, \\"I hope so.\\" Michael Knight was again mentioned by his son in the first episode of the new series. Traceur said that his father's real name was Michael Long, and his co-workers made fun of it. Later, Traceur decides to adopt the \\"Knight\\" family name in an attempt to start a new life, just like his father. =Other= Michael Knight appears as a playable character in Lego Dimensions, voiced by Nick Offerman.

History Templeton's Carpet Factory, Glasgow Green, Scotland The grave of James Templeton, Glasgow Necropolis James Templeton was a farmer's son born in the Campbeltown area in 1802. As a youth he came to Glasgow to work in a draper's shop. In 1823 he moved to Liverpool, and soon after he obtained a lucrative post in Mexico where he made enough money to return to Scotland and start his own business. Initially he opened a shawl manufactury in Paisley, in 1829. In 1837, through contact with another shawl manufacturer, William Quiglay, a new process was invented for processing chenille, a standard fabric for shawls, into compact C-shaped tufts which were both very soft and preserved their shape very well, enabling complex patterns to be created, and Templeton immediately saw this as ideal for carpet manufacture. Quiglay and Templeton took out a patent on this process, but only for 14 years.Made in Scotland, Carol Foreman, The ensuing carpet firm of \\"James Templeton & Son\\" was established in Bridgeton in 1839. The original factory was on King Street (now called Redan Street) but burned down in 1856. In 1857 a new factory was built on William Street (later renamed Templeton Street). The factory specialised in \\"picture carpets\\", such as the Twelve Apostles Carpet which they exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1867. James Templeton died in 1885 and is buried in the upper part of Glasgow Necropolis. In 1889 a further carpet mill was built facing Glasgow Green, based on the Doge's Palace, Venice. This quickly became a much-loved local landmark. The company also had its own recreational facilities in Rutherglen which are mostly now playing fields for the local high school, although the bowling club bearing the Templeton name at that location continues on its own. In 1969, Templeton's bought a rival carpet firm, Grays, of Ayr, but their expansion brought about the demise of the firm. The company was bought by an American group, the Guthrie Corporation, and briefly traded under the name of \\"British Carpets\\" but could not survive. At its peak, Templeton's Bridgeton factory employed 3000 people before closing in 1979. In 1981, the rights to use the name \\"James Templeton & Co\\" were purchased by their former rivals, \\"Stoddart & Co\\" who had begun carpet production in 1864 and a new factory was built in Elderslie. The Glasgow Green factory building was converted by the Scottish Development Agency and became a business centre, Templeton On The Green, in 1984. In 1990, when Glasgow was the City of Culture for that year, the building featured on a UK postage stamp.  References  Fred H.

The group has emerged with its members coming together on a single pointed agenda of protecting and improving the existing municipal bus transport system that is being offered to the residents of the city of Pune. Membership is currently estimated to be more than two thousand. Background The members carry out weekly public rallies near the Pune Municipal Corporation Bus Station. Such rallies have been reportedly observed at other places in the city. There have been newspaper reports that the group has petitioned the transport authorities to display bus timetables, provide a rationalization for routes and fares, and maintain a bus fleet proportional to the population of the city. In particular the group has referred to a study conducted by the Central Institute of Road Transport (Government of India) as regards the transport situation in the city. The group has demanded that its recommendations be speedily implemented. Weekly meetings are conducted Sundays from 16:00 to 17:00 Indian Standard Time near Nal Stop on Karve Road in the city of Pune. The group is not a formally registered society with the government of India, although one of the sub-groups belonging to a particular suburb was registered on account of an independent local initiative. The bus transport system if improved would also address the increasing indiscipline, pollution, delays and most of the difficulties that one encounters while traveling between any two points in the city. It is claimed by the group during rallies that this has long since been known to the municipal authorities and that they are certain about the effectiveness of improved city bus transport as regards the current state of traffic in Pune. Similar traffic conditions are experienced in several smaller towns and cities in India, but Pune Bus Pravasi Sangh is the first group to have emerged at the town/city level to further bus transport as an important and essential ingredient of municipal services.

Similar to the monochrome Star Castle, Eliminator uses color vector graphics and allows both cooperative and competitive multiplayer gameplay. It is the only four-player vector game ever made. Gameplay Players pilot a space ship around the playfield (space) and must destroy alien drones. The ultimate goal is to evade and destroy the Eliminator, a huge asteroid base. The players fire causes any enemy that is struck (with the exception of the Eliminator itself) to rebound and careen off in another direction. With a little skill, shots can propel the enemy into the Eliminator thus destroying them. There is only one way to destroy the Eliminator, fire a cannon blast down the trench into its center. This can be done directly or via a ricochet. Failure to destroy the Eliminator after a preset time causes the center to activate a drone that flies out of the Eliminator to shoot down the player with a destructive energy blast. The playfield becomes enclosed in an invisible barrier that bounces shots and ships off it, thus increasing the chances of death. Once the Eliminator is destroyed, the game restarts with a tougher set of enemies. The four player version allowed four players to simultaneously make attack runs on the Eliminator while trying to evade or destroy various other opponents. In four player mode, players must also dodge other player's ships.  Legacy  The game is included as an unlockable game in the PSP version of Sega Genesis Collection.

It is sometimes attributed to Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube and dated 1137. The first modern critical edition of the text was published in 1888 by Ernest Langlois under the title Le Couronnement de Louis. The chanson is, as its title indicates, about the coronation of Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne. The story begins with the aging emperor preparing to abdicate the throne to his fifteen-year- old son. Louis is hesitant in the face of the enormous responsibilities that attend the wearing of the crown. When the emperor dies, to the spontaneous ringing of bells, Arn√©√Øs d'Orl√©ans assumes the reins of government until the young prince has come of age; Louis meanwhile abides at the court of Guillaume d'Orange. Guillaume soon embarks on a pilgrimage to Rome with the young Louis and there they find the city besieged by Saracens. Guillaume challenges a Saracen champion to single combat and decisively defeats him, becoming a champion of the Pope and the saviour of Rome in the process. He has lost, however, the tip of his nose, from the Saracen's sword, and is thenceforth known by the sobriquet Guillaume au court nez: Guillaume of the short nose. This early chanson is highly historical in character. Its description of Charlemagne is gleaned largely from the entry for the year 813 in the Vita Hludowici. As it was composed during the reign of Louis VII of France, who was for most of his life without a male heir, the politics behind the story's strong emphasis on the hereditary nature of kingship is partial to the Capetian.

His firm seeks to understand historical changes in markets and predict results for seven years into the future. When there is deviation from historical means (averages), the firm may take an investment position based on a return to the mean. The firm allocates assets based on internal predictions of market direction. Views on market bubbles and the 2007‚Äì2008 credit crisis Grantham has built much of his investing reputation over his long career by claiming to identify speculative market \\"bubbles\\" as they were unfolding. Grantham claims to have mostly avoided investing in Japanese equities and real estate in the late eighties, as well as technology stocks during the Internet bubble in the late nineties. In GMO's April 2010 Quarterly Letter Grantham spoke to the tendency for all bubbles to revert to the mean saying: In his Fall 2008 GMO letter, Grantham commented on his evaluation of the underlying causes of the then-ongoing world credit crisis Grantham focused on the issue of personal traits and leadership in trying to explain how we reached the current economic crisis. Views on fossil fuels and the Keystone pipeline Grantham has repeatedly stated his opinion that the rising cost of energy ‚Äì the most fundamental commodity ‚Äì between 2002 and 2008 has falsely inflated economic growth and GDP figures worldwide and that we have been in a \\"carbon bubble\\" for approximately the last 250 years in which energy was very cheap. He believes that this bubble is coming to an end. He has stated his opposition to the Keystone Pipeline on the basis of the ruinous environmental consequences that its construction will bring to Alberta and to the entire planet due to the contribution that burning the extracted oil would make to climate change. Timber investment Grantham is known to be a strong advocate for investments in the timber industry that also relies on trees for biomass/biofuel (wood chips). The potential conflict of interest with Grantham's philantropic engagement for the \\"beyond coal\\" campaign of the Sierra Club was criticized in Jeff Gibbs' documentary Planet of the Humans. Philanthropy Grantham, together with his wife Hannelore, established the Grantham Foundation For the Protection of the Environment in 1997. Substantial commitments have been made to Imperial College London, the London School of Economics and the University of Sheffield, to establish the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and Environment, the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures, respectively, which will enable the institutions to build on their extensive expertise in climate change research. The 2011 tax filing for the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment shows the Foundation donated $1 million to both the Sierra Club and to Nature Conservancy, and $2 million to the Environmental Defense Fund that year. The Foundation has also provided support to Greenpeace, the WWF, Rare and the Smithsonian.

Flynn which outlines his model for an explanation of the eponymous Flynn effect. The book summarizes much of the work of Flynn in this area, as well as that of his colleague William Dickens of the Brookings Institution. The four \\"paradoxes\\" of the Flynn effect The book begins with a description of what has generally become known as \\"the Flynn effect\\": the steady rise from one generation to the next in average scores on IQ tests over time. Flynn notes that this effect apparently contradicts some fundamental beliefs about IQ long held by human intelligence researchers, and categorizes these contradictions into four seeming \\"paradoxes\\": # The factor analysis paradox ‚Äì past research has shown evidence for a single factor, \\"g\\" or general intelligence, underlying IQ. However, the Flynn effect happens to different degrees in the sub-tests of the WISC test, suggesting that intelligence as measured by IQ tests is multidimensional. Flynn poses this as: \\"how can intelligence be both one and many at the same time\\". # The intelligence paradox ‚Äì the Flynn effect shows significant improvements in IQ over a short time scale, yet we do not notice in everyday life that young people are significantly smarter than their parents or grandparents. # The mental retardation paradox ‚Äì the IQ level commonly associated with mental retardation is 75. If the Flynn effect is extrapolated back to 1900 the mean IQ would be somewhere between 50 and 70 ‚Äì that is the average person in 1900 would have been intellectually disabled by modern IQ norms. # The identical twins paradox ‚Äì past IQ research has shown a close relation between the IQs of identical twins reared separately; a fact used as evidence for a genetic basis for differences in IQ. The rapid changes in IQ shown by the Flynn effect suggest, conversely, that environmental factors have a greater influence on IQ than genes. Much of the remainder of the book is then devoted to proposing possible ways to resolve these inconsistencies, outlining along the way a reconceptualization of \\"intelligence\\" and how it might be better measured and studied. The Dickens/Flynn model The Dickens/Flynn model, as outlined in the book, attempts to explain the Flynn effect by suggesting that genes and environment have interacted in manner which leads to a multiplying of influence from both on IQ scores. In particular, people now live in a cognitive environment that has changed substantially over the past century. New ways of thinking and new modes of communication and entertainment have changed the way people think across society. At an individual level a similar multiplying effect leads to people with a genetic advantage in intelligence seeking out more cognitively challenging environments ‚Äì thus exaggerating individual differences in intelligence. In both cases the role of an enhanced cognitive environment plays a role in within-generation and across-generation differences in IQ scores. Conceptual framework (BIDS) Flynn offers a framework for further developing theories of intelligence. The framework involves three conceptual levels for understanding intelligence: * B ‚Äì brain. How the brain is structured * ID ‚Äì individual differences. How individuals differ in cognitive tasks. * S ‚Äì society. How real-world cognitive tasks show trends over time. Flynn goes on to criticize conceptual imperialism as being a particular error in which those various levels are confused with one single level ‚Äì for example brain or social differences being seen primarily in terms of general- intelligence, a concept from the individual-differences level. Shorthand abstractions (SHA) Flynn offers as a mechanism for improved cognitive performance across society, shorthand abstractions (a.k.a SHAs) A SHA is a word or phrase that describes some complex phenomenon in a way that enables people to more easily think about abstract issues. As examples, Flynn suggested market (in an economic sense), percentage, natural selection and placebo. Reviews Charles Murray, the co-author of The Bell Curve (1994), wrote in his comments about this book that appeared on its back cover in publication, \\"This book is a gold mine of pointers to interesting work, much of which was new to me. All of us who wrestle with the extraordinarily difficult questions about intelligence that Flynn discusses are in his debt.\\" * Netherlands Journal of Psychology * New Yorker * American Scholar * New Scientist * Cosma Shalizi * Tyler Cowen References Category:2007 non- fiction books Category:Books about human intelligence Category:Cambridge University Press books Category:Intelligence Category:Race and intelligence controversy ","title":"What Is Intelligence?"},{"id":"16760316","text":"Aksel Fossen (29 November 1919 ‚Äì 31 August 2009) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party.

Upon arriving at KOMO 4 in 1993, he initially started out as the station's weekend sports anchor, replacing longtime KOMO sportscaster Rick Meeder and fill-in sports anchor Bob Rondeau. In 1994, he created a popular segment titled \\"Eric's Little Heroes\\", which focuses on the athletic plight of Seattle-area children in Little League games across the area, and is presented in an off- the-wall and humorous fashion. (In 2006, Eric's Little Heroes was discontinued, until strong viewer support brought the feature back in early 2008). In September, 1995, longtime KOMO sports director Bruce King retired from broadcasting the eleven o'clock evening sportscasts, leading the way for Eric Johnson to assume the role of KOMO sports director. In July 1996, Bruce King retired from KOMO-TV after a career spanning more than 30 years, and in his retirement, he named Eric Johnson as the new sports director for all weeknight editions of KOMO News 4. In his 25 years at KOMO, Eric has been awarded more than 25 Regional Emmy Awards, and in 2007, he was given the highest prize in local television news, a National Edward R. Murrow Award for best feature story in the country. His career at KOMO has seen him cover nearly every major sports event in Seattle, and in some cases abroad. He produced an award-winning documentary about a group of American children who traveled to Cuba to play a series of baseball games against Cuban teams. And in 2005, he led coverage of the Seattle Seahawks trip to the Super Bowl. He can frequently be seen reporting live on location, whenever the Mariners, Sonics, or Seahawks are playing. In the second half of 2006, Johnson began anchoring the news for the first time. He took over the reins of KOMO 4 News at 5 o'clock from longtime news anchor Dan Lewis, when KOMO underwent a broadcast schedule change involving their evening newscast lineup. Lewis anchored the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news with Kathi Goertzen (2007-2008), and with Mary Nam (2008-2014). Johnson anchored the 5 p.m. news with Kathi Goertzen (2007-2008), and Mary Nam or Dan Lewis (2008-2012). Johnson currently anchors the 5 p.m. newscast with Molly Shen, and the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts with Mary Nam after his colleague Dan Lewis stepped away from the anchor desk after 27 years in May 2014. His colleague Dan Lewis' son Tim (former weekend sports anchor for KOMO 4) formerly held the role as sports director at KREM 2 from January 2009-May 2012, the role Johnson held from 1987-1989.

Taito published the Japanese version, while Acclaim published the American and European version. A Microsoft Windows version was also released in 1996. The player takes control of a futuristic fighter jet that has two main weapons. Unlike other shooters this game does not have any power ups. Instead the player's ship has a laser sub-weapon that homes into locked on targets. The player must battle against extraterrestrial ships which can range from small fighters to large mother ships. Reception GamePros brief review of the game stated that \\"No power-ups juice the action, but the absorbing combat and responsive controls don't need any help. Strike's graphics and sounds are too plain, though. A weekend's rental will see you through ...\\" Next Generations reviewer agreed that the lack of upgrades and power-ups makes the game more dull, but further stated that \\"Jupiter Strike is noteworthy strictly for having almost no good qualities at all.\\" He criticized the jerky control, uninspired enemy designs, and poor sound quality, and said that neither of the two view options gives the player an adequate view of incoming threats. He viewed the game as an indication that Acclaim may have wasted its money in the acquisition of exclusive rights to publishing Taito's games in the U.S., and gave it one out of five stars.

Variant names According to the Geographic Names Information System, it has also been known historically as: * Peter's Creek Course Peters Creek starts in Nottingham Township in Washington County and runs generally northerly until it joins the Monongahela River at Clairton in Allegheny County.  Watershed  The Peters Creek watershed is a diverse fifty square miles in southwestern Allegheny County and northeastern Washington County. From the heavy industry in the east where Peters Creek enters the Monongahela River, to the commercial northeast, the suburban northern communities, and the still rural and farming south, the watershed is a veritable patchwork of land use types. There is also a county park, a turnpike, a landfill, and a coal mining legacy to add to the mix. Some communities are relatively stable while others are undergoing rapid development. Peters Creek and its tributaries provide utility to them all in a myriad of ways.  Tributaries  *Lewis Run, in Jefferson Hills *Beam's Run, in Jefferson Hills *Lick Run, in South Park Township *Piney Fork Run, in South Park Township Peters Creek also collects numerous unnamed tributaries along its course.  Water quality and recreation  Because of past water quality issues, Peters Creek was not considered to have any recreational purpose, but since the 1990s the water quality has improved dramatically. Once plagued with garbage and acid mine drainage, the water quality is now high enough to support its own fish population, which includes trout, bass, catfish, carp, and bluegill. It is now again possible to enjoy the stream through such activities as fishing, swimming, and during high water, kayaking.

It is operated by the Kansas Historical Society as Constitution Hall State Historic Site.  History  Constitution Hall was constructed by Samuel J. Jones, the pro-slavery sheriff tasked with keeping the peace in Douglas County in the 1850s. He rented the structure out to the territorial government based out of Lecompton. During 1857 this building was one of the busiest and most important in Kansas Territory. Thousands of settlers and speculators filed claims in the United States land office on the first floor. They sometimes fought hand-to-hand for their share of the rich lands that were opening for settlement. The government was removing the Native Americans from Kansas to make their lands available to whites. Upstairs the district court periodically met to try to enforce the territorial laws. Most free-state people refused to obey these laws because they had been passed by the proslavery territorial legislature, which they called \\"bogus\\". This resistance made law enforcement nearly impossible for territorial officials. Time after time the territorial governors called out federal troops from Fort Leavenworth or Fort Riley to maintain order. In January 1857 the second territorial legislative assembly met on the upper floor. Although still firmly proslavery, this group removed some of the earlier laws that their antislavery neighbors opposed. The Lecompton Constitutional Convention met that fall in this same second-floor assembly room. The purpose of the convention was to draft a constitution to gain statehood for Kansas. Newspaper correspondents from across the country gathered to report on the meetings. Pro-slavery men dominated the convention, and created a document that protected slavery no matter how the people of the Kansas Territory voted. This was intolerable for their antislavery opponents, who refused to participate in what they considered to be an illegal government. Congress, after investigation, found the election of the pro-slavery legislature extensively corrupted by fraud, specifically by Missouri \\"border ruffians\\" who came into Kansas only to vote, not to live there. Congress therefore refused to admit Kansas as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution, so it never went into effect. Instead, free- state forces rallied their supporters. They gained control of the territorial legislature in the October 1857 election. Two months later this new legislature was called into special session to deal with critical territorial problems. They met in the same Lecompton assembly hall that their political enemies had controlled only a few weeks before. Here they began to reform the laws of Kansas Territory according to their own beliefs. That work continued during later legislative sessions. In 1858 the assembly was moved from the proslavery capital of Lecompton to the free-state town of Lawrence. The Constitution Hall State Historic Site was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. and See also * Constitution Hall (Topeka, Kansas) References External links * Constitution Hall - Kansas Historical Society * Constitution Hall - Lecompton, Kansas * Constitution Hall - Kansas Travel, photos * Category:Government buildings completed in 1857 Category:Museums in Douglas County, Kansas Category:National Historic Landmarks in Kansas Category:Kansas state historic sites Category:History museums in Kansas Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Kansas Category:Lecompton, Kansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Douglas County, Kansas Category:1857 establishments in Kansas Territory Category:Capitols of Kansas ","title":"Constitution Hall (Lecompton, Kansas)"},{"id":"16760465","text":"Tor Oftedal (born 14 January 1925 in Sandnes, died 5 October 1980) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party.

Biography  Rainer Polak studied social anthropology, African linguistics, Bambara language, and History of Africa from 1989 to 1996 at Bayreuth University (Germany), and jenbe music performance from 1991 until today in Bamako (Mali). All of his studies and work in Bamako were accomplished with the help of locally and traditionally minded drummers whose playing is presented in his book and the corresponding CD. Polak worked as a professional jenbe player in Bamako for one year in 1997/98, performing at well over a hundred traditional weddings, spirit possession dances and other celebrations on the basis of being hired by the late Jaraba Jakite, most of the times, and occasionally by the late Yamadu Bani Dunbia, by Jeli Madi Kuyate, and by Drissa Kone. The ethnomusicological dissertation and book he wrote on that experience won the academic prize of the German African Studies Association in 2003/04. Polak ranks as an outstanding jenbe soloist in Germany. As a teacher he has specialized in giving focused classes on micro-timing, and master-classes in jenbe solo performance.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It was further declared to be a National Historic Landmark in 1990, nationally significant for its association with Bernhard Warkentin, a pivotal figure in the development and wide cultivation of durum wheat in the country. Description and history The Warkentin Farm is located on the northern fringe of Halsted, on the east side of Main Street at East North Street. The property consists of , bound on the south by railroad tracks, the north and east by the Arkansas River, and the west by a grain elevator. The farm complex is clustered near the western end of the property, with fields to the east. Buildings in the farmstead include the house, carriage house, barn, a silo, and a small pump house. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, built in 1884 to a design by Kansas architect John G. Haskell. Bernhard Warkentin was a well-to-do Ukrainian immigrant of German extraction, who immigrated to the United States from Russia in 1872. In Russia he had been involved in the family business, the raising and milling of wheat. A de facto leader of a Mennonite emigration and colonization effort, Warkentin purchased over , and established is home and mill here in 1874, while working to assist other German Mennonites in their drive to leave Russia. One of the major improvements in agriculture that Warkentin and the Mennonites brought with them were knowledge of Russian hard wheat varieties, which they brought over in the early years of the colonization. In 1896, Warkentin began working with Mark Carleton of the United States Department of Agriculture to improve American knowledge of Russian wheat varieties, which eventually resulted in the hybridization experiments that produced durum wheat, one of the nation's leading wheat crops.

The complex is an important set of sites that is one of the few in the region bridging the periods of prehistory and European contact, with a period of significance between 1500 and 1700 CE. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Description The Tobias-Thompson Complex consists of eight archaeological sites, located on both sides of the Little Arkansas River. They are believed to represent portions of a single large settlement area, subdivided into separate villages. Given the complex's location, it is possible that this was a village site visited by Spanish explorer Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado during his 1541 expedition to a place he called Quivira. Typical features of these sites include the presence of a council circle, depressions consistent with known forms of period semi-subterranean living structures, and mounds representing food caches or refuse middens. Some of the sites have lost surface-level artifacts due to cultivation, while others have never been cultivated and are covered by a layer of native sod. Some of the sites have long been known as sources of artifacts, and have been subjected to looting. Despite this, the size and scope of the sites is such that there is a great deal of potential information to be recovered by further investigation. The Tobias site was excavated three times by archaeologist Waldo Wedel for the Smithsonian Institution, in 1940, 1965, and 1971. The 1965 excavation was particularly significant, because it uncovered evidence of a deeper habitation layer beneath that site's council circle. Finds from these investigations include pottery fragments, stone and bone tools and projectile points, and human remains.

The park has open grassy areas and a small parking area, and the original site of the oil well is marked by a plaque. The park originally housed a small visitors center, playground, restrooms, and the replica derrick, but all of these were removed due to repeated flooding. The Neodesha area was known to Native Americans for glowing \\"gas springs\\" prior to its settlement by westward-migrating Americans. Reports of this feature eventually brought William Mills, an oil explorer to the town. One of the sites he selected for drilling was on the land of T.J. Norman, a local blacksmith. On November 28, 1892, the well struck oil at a depth of . This kicked off a local boom, which was eventually expanded to a much larger geographic area by other finds. and Norman No. 1 operated until 1919, when part of the well casing failed, and its infrastructure was dismantled. The city built a replica of the derrick and other infrastructure on the site in 1961, turning it into a small park and tourist attraction. The derrick and museum were moved to Main Street in 1989, due to repeated flooding of the site.

It was built by Gerat H. Hollenberg in 1858, to serve travelers on the Oregon and California Trails, and was used by the Pony Express when it was established in 1860. The station is owned by the state of Kansas and is operated by the Kansas Historical Society as Hollenberg Pony Express Station State Historic Site. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Description and history Hollenberg Home Station, 2019 thumb The Hollenberg Pony Express Station is located about east of Hanover, Kansas along Kansas Highway 243. The station consists of a 1-1/2 story rectangular Cottonwood frame building, with a gabled roof, wooden shingled exterior, and stone foundation. The building is organized into six rooms, four of which served as the Hollenberg family residence, one served as a shop, and the last as a bar and tavern space. The loft area served as a sleeping area for riders of the Pony Express and guests.https://abandonedkansas.wordpress.com/2019/08/29/hollenberg-pony- express-home-station/ The building was historically accompanied by a stable and blacksmith's shop. The station was built in 1858 by Gerat H. Hollenberg c. 1857 or 1858, as a way station on the Oregon and California migrant trails. When the Pony Express service was inaugurated, it was made a \\"home station\\" where riders switched mounts. The Pony Express operated for only 18 months, ending service in October 1861. The station also served the Butterfield Overland Mail. Hollenberg traded with emigrants on the trails, operated the westernmost Pony Express station in Kansas, and provided relay services for the Overland Mail. The building has never been moved and retains its original dimensions. Hollenberg prospered, establishing the town of Hanover, Kansas and winning election to the Kansas Legislature. Hollenberg died in 1874, and thereafter the property was used as a farmstead until 1941. It was purchased by the state in that year, and turned over the state historical society for maintenance and management in 1963. The site is open between March and October.

It was directed and produced by Lawrence Turman, whose credits most notably include producing 1967's high-grossing hit The Graduate, which also was adapted from a book by Webb. It stars Richard Benjamin in the title role and Joanna Shimkus as his beleaguered wife, with Adam West, Elizabeth Ashley, Patricia Barry, and Tiffany Bolling in supporting roles. Synopsis The story mainly deals with the crumbling marriage of William Alren (Richard Benjamin) and his wife Lisa (Joanna Shimkus), and how William uses voyeurism and extra-marital affairs to \\"spice up\\" his marriage. William gives up his career as a stockbroker, and takes up voyeurism full-time. After putting up with her husband's various dalliances, Lisa is advised by her outspoken sister Nan (Elizabeth Ashley) to get a divorce. Nan's own marriage to Chester (Adam West) is in no better shape than Lisa's and equally on the rocks. The film ends with William and Lisa reunited, but not before Lisa finally gets \\"revenge\\" on her husband. Cast * Richard Benjamin as William Alren * Joanna Shimkus as Lisa * Adam West as Chester * Elizabeth Ashley as Nan * Patricia Barry * Tiffany Bolling Critical reception Critic Leonard Maltin felt that while the film was a \\"humorous and sad depiction of marital breakdown\\", the cast was let down by a script that \\"seems uncertain as to what point it wants to drive across\\" (Maltin, 1991: 769). Steven Scheuer concurred somewhat, saying that while the film was \\"occasionally amusing\\" it also tended to be \\"generally heavy-handed\\" (Scheuer, 1990: 672). Roger Greenspun generally found the picture to be miscast, especially Richard Benjamin, feeling that while he is \\"a good comedian [he is] miscast [in this role]\\" (Greenspun, 1971). He also thought it closer to an \\"unsuccessful television pilot\\" than a movie, in terms of its treatment of themes such as \\"sexual mechanics, the mechanics of marital supremacy, [and] the nuclear family as a machine for getting on in the suburbs\\" (Greenspun, 1971). Leslie Halliwell called it a \\"sardonic adult comedy of the battle of the sexes\\" (Halliwell, 2000: 522).

Ruiz as associate producers. Plot The film follows a group of eight people who living in a crumbling, unknown installation. They are survivors of a cataclysmic war. Maria (group leader), Pablo (her boyfriend), Jesus, Lucas, Mateo, Magda, and teen Ana all live together. Judas and Pedro (Maria's former lover) live away from the others. Jesus, the only young boy, films everything on a digicam. Jesus and Ana visit Judas in the basement whenever possible, as he treats them like adults. On the way to his rooms they pass decrepit corridors that are out of bounds, although Jesus leaves food for the \\"Solitary Child\\" that lives in the area. Old TV sets show 1950s cartoons and science films with propaganda messages about destroying an unnamed enemy. Another film declares the enemy had developed a virus that destroys skin, making the infected victim constantly bleed but never die. The survivors can't leave the complex and live in fear of the \\"Strangers\\" and \\"Invisibles\\" (only seen as a green mist in the corridors). The survivors' only defense is to cut the complex's power and heat; the Dark (or Cold) Hour of the title. The \\"Strangers\\" are the infected mentioned in the propaganda films. When food, medical supplies and ammunition begin to run out they must travel to a supply depot outside of their underground safe zone. Pablo, Pedro and Lucas are chosen to get the supplies. Pablo is frightened when a Stranger begins stalking them. Pedro uses the confusion to push Pablo into a room full of Strangers, letting him become infected. Pablo's death devastates Maria and makes the other survivors question their future. Mateo wonders if it would be better if the group made a suicide pact instead of face such a bleak future. The complex is then invaded by the Invisibles. Ana stumbles into the green mist and frantically tries to get into another room. Mateo rescues her and they kiss briefly. The next day the Solitary Child shows up because his home was overrun by Strangers. As he is cleaned up by the children the others organize an attack on the Strangers. Magda learns of Mateo and Ana's kiss and slaps him for taking advantage. During the attack Mateo and Lucas are infected and killed by their comrades. A Stranger slips past them, though, and chases the children until he touches Jesus. The children escape and hide in a fridge until the others rescue them. Pedro wants to kill Jesus, but is stopped by the others. Unlike everyone else Jesus doesn't become infected. Maria later finds Pedro who has become paranoid and talks about the voices behind the walls. Maria tackles him and a shotgun is heard going off. Magda, Judas and the children find an armed Pedro and an injured Maria. While they talk Pedro stares into the distance, watching the Invisibles come up behind the survivors. Pedro walks into the green lights while the others run away, supporting Maria. As they run they shoot at the lights. Coming to a garage Judas opens the doors and they run outside for the first time, where it's nighttime. They drop their weapons and sit in a town square, surrounded by Strangers. Jesus looks into his digicam and says they will have to join the Strangers, but at least it won't hurt. Jesus looks at the sky where the Earth suddenly rises over the buildings. As the camera pulls back it's revealed that the complex is under a geodesic dome on the moon. The Earth is clearly surrounded by debris and is shown to be completely shattered to the core.

After receiving his PhD from University College London in 1968, he was a research associate at State University of New York at Albany until 1971. He then returned to University College London as a research fellow. From 1971 to 1972 he served as a temporary lecturer in organic chemistry at King's College London, and as a research associate at Sir John Cass School of Science and Technology, City of London Polytechnic from 1972 to 1975. In 1975 Kennedy moved to the University of Leeds where he was successively research fellow, senior lecturer and reader in inorganic chemistry. In 2000 he was appointed professor of inorganic chemistry at Leeds. He retired in 2008 with the title emeritus professor.University of Leeds, List of Emeritus Professors In 1993 he received the J E Purkyne Medal from the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. In 1994 he made a successful ascent of Kilimanjaro. In 2000 he was awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry 1999 Silver Medal for Main-Group Chemistry. Research interests Kennedy has been at the forefront of macropolyhedral megaloborane chemistry for many years. His research interests are diverse, involving many different species of heteroboranes, metallaboranes, metallaheteroboranes and carboranes. A major theme is the exploration of the spectrum of intimacy between clusters: from discrete polyhedra connected by rigid organic tethers, to giant megaloboranes, generated through the seamless fusion of multiple clusters. The unusual cluster-geometries and hydride-like properties of the compounds synthesized in the Kennedy group make them ideal candidates for the investigation of unconventional intermolecular interactions, such as the dihydrogen bond. The Kennedy group also focuses on the novel structures obtained through the introduction of metals and heteroatoms into polyhedral boranes: these \\"disobedient skeletons\\", some described as \\"iso-nido\\" or \\"iso-closo\\", do not follow Wade's rules. These boron clusters may act as flexible scaffolds for catalytically active metals. Professor Kennedy is a leading authority on the reaction chemistry of metallaboranes. He has also been involved with the synthesis of relatively inert monocarborane derivatives as non-coordinating counter-anions for many industrial applications. Awards Kennedy has published 383 papers. According to \\"Web of Science\\" he has an h-index of 40. Such a high h-index is exceptional, especially for a chemist working in an unfashionable field.

Appearance The King Edward potato is predominantly white-skinned with pink colouration. It is mostly oval in shape, with a floury texture and shallow eyes. The plant is upright and tall with numerous stems and small green leaves. Its flowers are purple with white-tipped petals. History In Redcliffe Salaman's book The History and Social Influence of the Potato first published in 1949, it was noted that parentage of King Edward was unknown. It was bred by a gardener in Northumberland who called it 'Fellside Hero' and passed into the hands of a grower in Yorkshire and in turn a potato merchant in Manchester who having no use for it passed it onto John Butler of Scotter in Lincolnshire. He in turn purchased all the seed stocks available and multiplied the variety on 50 acres of land before renaming the variety King Edward on the advice of a potato merchant. The Coronation of King Edward VII in 1902 coincided with the introduction of this variety of potato and its name is believed to originate as a 'commemoration' of this occasion. It is claimed that the grower wrote to Buckingham Palace seeking permission to name his potato after the monarch and that a reply was received granting royal assent. It is one of the oldest surviving varieties in Europe. Cultivating The King Edward potato is a main crop; in the UK it is traditionally planted in April for harvest in September. It is suitable to be grown both commercially and in allotments. It is very resistant to common scab and offers some resistance to potato blight but is susceptible to potato cyst nematode. Culinary The King Edward has a variety of culinary uses and is renowned for its light fluffy texture; for this reason it is particularly suitable for roasting, mashed potato or baking, although it is also suitable for chipping, saut√©ing and steaming. It has been described by Delia Smith as being the best potato with which to make gnocchi.

It was discovered on 17 November 1927 by Okuro Oikawa at the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, Japan. The asteroid was named after the Japanese city of Nikk≈ç.  Orbit and classification  Nikko orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,222 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Nikkos observation arc begins with its first used observation taken at Johannesburg Observatory in 1930, or 3 years after its official discovery observation at Tokyo.  Physical characteristics  In both the Tholen and SMASS taxonomy, Nikko is a common stony S-type asteroid. = Rotation period = Between 2004 and 2011, several rotational lightcurves of Nikko were obtained from photometric observations taken by astronomers Laurent Bernasconi, Hiromi and Hiroko Hamanowa, John Menke, Robert Stephens, as well as at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period between 3.781 and 3.792 hours with a brightness variation between 0.26 and 0.50 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Nikko measures 8.347 and 12.56 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo of 0.370 and 0.164, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 11.35 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.09.

The species has an official listing as critically endangered on the Australian Commonwealth EPBC Act and as Endangered on the NSW Threatened Species Act. The name hardeniana honours the botanist Gwen Harden. Phylogenetics studies now suggest it represents a basal branch of the Proteoid clade of the Proteaceae. Distribution and habitat The trees are only known to grow naturally in a single creek catchment in warm temperate rainforest in the Nightcap Range, northern New South Wales, Australia. They grow naturally in relatively poor, acidic volcanic soils, in an area of a high rainfall. Only around 100 wild plants are known. Plants are in cultivation, including in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. Much of its habitat was devastated by bushfire in 2019-20. Description Eidothea hardeniana trees have pale lichen covered bark typical of many species in the Warm Temperate Rainforests. Often a ring of coppice shoots surrounds the base of an adult tree, coppice and seedling leaves have spiny marginal teeth, while adult leaves have no teeth. Flowers are cream, occur in clusters and smell of aniseed. Fruits are large and rounded with a yellow green skin and a hard nut inside. The walls of the nut are ribbed, a feature unique to this genus in the family. The seed has a white center and it probably contains poisonous cyanogenic compounds like some species of Macadamia. These toxins do not deter rodents from eating through the hard nut and devouring the seeds, limiting the regeneration of this plant.

Same-sex sexual activity is outlawed in at least twenty Asian countries. While at least eight countries have enacted protections for LGBT people, only Israel and the Taiwan provide a wider range of LGBT rights ‚Äì including same-sex relationship recognition. In Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, homosexual activity is punished with the death penalty. The legal punishment for same-sex sexual activity has varied among juristic schools: some prescribe capital punishment; while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment such as imprisonment. In some relatively less religiously conservative Muslim-majority countries such as Azerbaijan and Jordan, homosexuality is legal, but usually socially unacceptable. Egalitarian relationships modeled on the Western pattern have become more frequent, though they remain rare. Cambodia, East Timor, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Vietnam and Cyprus are viewed as the most open to the LGBT community in Asia. Japan, Israel, Thailand, Taiwan and Nepal are the major players in legislation. , only Taiwan, the British Overseas Territories of Akrotiri and Dhekelia and the British Indian Ocean Territory have legalized same-sex marriage. In a 2011 UN General Assembly declaration for LGBT rights, state parties were given a chance to express their support or opposition on the topic. Only Armenia, Georgia, Cyprus, Israel, South Korea, Japan, Mongolia, Nepal, Thailand, and East Timor expressed their support. They were later joined by Vietnam and the Philippines. State parties who expressed opposition were Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, the Maldives, North Korea, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Syria, Afghanistan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Other Asian parties did not show support or opposition. The first and only LGBT political party in the world, Ladlad, was established in the Philippines in 2003. In 2016, during an African-led coalition to dislodge the recently established UN expert on LGBT issues, the majority of Asian nations backed to retain the role of the UN LGBT expert, with only Muslim nations, with the addition of China and Singapore, declaring their opposition. In 2019, a survey by The Economist found 45% of respondents in the Asia-Pacific believed that same-sex marriage is inevitable in the region, while 31% of respondents disagreed. Furthermore, three-quarters of those surveyed reported a more open climate for LGBT rights compared to three years ago. Of those reporting an improving climate for LGBT people, 38% cited a change in policies or laws. Meanwhile, 36% said coverage of LGBT issues in mainstream media was a major factor. The top reasons cited for diminishing openness was anti-LGBT advocacy by religious institutions.

Early life Although born in Ciudad Bol√≠var, Venezuela, Pisaroni's family moved to Busseto in Italy ‚Äì the home of Giuseppe Verdi ‚Äî when he was four years old. There, his father owned a car-repair firm and his mother was a teacher;Picard, Anna. \\"People: 418. Luca Pisaroni\\", Opera, January 2014, Vol. 65, No. 1, pp. 6‚Äî13. it was in that town where he noted \\"you feel Verdi's spirit all over the place!\\" and where his love of opera began. Musical studies and training In Busseto, he states that \\"as a kid, I used to go to the opera with my grandfather, and when I was 11, I already knew I wanted to be an opera singer.\\" While not actually attending the musical academy run by the famous local tenor Carlo Bergonzi‚Äîhe listened-in to his master classes after school‚Äî Pisaroni was influenced by the tenor: :I did not technically train with Bergonzi, because I was too young. I sang for him when I was 13 or 14 and he told me to wait until my voice would change and I would be able to start singing. While I did not technically work with him, I listened to his teaching almost every afternoon, and this really taught me a lot in terms of diction, phrasing and how to use your voice to communicate to an audience. I consider him one of my teachers because of that. The way he sang, phrased and used his instrument was unbelievable. His approach on singing was unique and made him one the best Verdi tenors.Gazzola interview in Opera Lively He began his training at the Conservatorio Giuseppe Verdi in Milan, where he was not comfortable, and so continued his studies for a year in Buenos Aires with Renato Sassola and Rozita Zozulya, and also in New York. Singing career After his musical training in Milan, Buenos Aires and New York, Pisaroni's professional operatic debut was in the title role of Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro in Klagenfurt, in 2001. That same year, he was awarded the Eberhard-W√§chter-Medal as \\"Newcomer of the Season\\" by the Vienna State Opera.Full biography on imgartists.com, retrieved 20 June 2010.Salzburger Festspiele 2007, retrieved 4 April 2008. Pisaroni sang Masetto at the 2002 Salzburg Festival in Mozart's Don Giovanni. These early appearances led to engagements throughout the world in the major Mozart operas. Pisaroni has since appeared in major opera houses and festivals across Europe and America. In 2002, he debuted at the Whitsun Baroque Festival with Haydn's Nelson Mass, and at the Salzburg Summer Festival as Masetto in Don Giovanni, where he has performed every summer since. =Opera= Apart from the aforementioned roles, Pisaroni also has an extensive list of onstage performances to his credit. These include many Mozart roles such as Publio (from La Clemenza di Tito) for the Salzburg Festival at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, as well as at the Metropolitan Opera. Leporello (from Don Giovanni) at the Teatro Real in Madrid and the Op√©ra Bastille followed, then Figaro again at The Santa Fe Opera as well as at the Met. At the Th√©√¢tre des Champs- Elys√©es he performed once more as Papageno in Die Zauberfl√∂te. Guglielmo (from Cos√¨ fan tutte) for the Netherlands Opera, the Glyndebourne Festival Opera, and the Salzburg Mozart Week were additions to his Mozart portrayals. Pisaroni appeared as Alidoro in La Cenerentola in Santiago, Chile, and, in 2012, as the title character in Maometto II at The Santa Fe Opera, which presented the world premiere of the new critical edition prepared by Philip Gossett from the 1820 edition. His Puccini roles have included Colline in La boh√®me. Pisaroni's appearances in Handel roles such as Tiridate in Radamisto at the Houston Opera, in addition to Achilla in Giulio Cesare for Opera Colorado and Melisso from Alcina, have been distinguished, but regarding his attitude to singing more Baroque opera and, specifically, in response to a question as to whether he might do some Cavalli or some Vivaldi in addition, he stated: :To be honest with you, I find the Baroque very interesting both dramatically and vocally, but it is something that you need to let go after a while, if you want to develop your voice to do a certain \\"heavier\\" repertoire. Many Baroque singers only sing Baroque and this is not what I want to do. I enjoyed doing Baroque; [in addition to the roles named above] I did Rinaldo, Cavalli's Ercole Amante, and I did Ariodante but there is a moment when you say \\"if I want my voice to develop I need to explore other repertoire\\". In a different vein, he sang Caliban in the baroque pasticcio The Enchanted Island at the Met in 2011 and he returned there in April/May 2014 for performances in La Cenerentola.\\"La Cenerentola\\" on metoperafamily.org Retrieved 5 January 2014 He returned to the Met in 2015 as Leporello in the company's production of Don Giovanni. =Concerts= In concert performances, Pisaroni has sung Zebul in H√§ndel's Jephtha with the Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt. He has also performed Michael Haydn's Requiem in C minor under Ivor Bolton, and Mozart's Mass in C Minor under Marc Minkowski, both at the Salzburg Festival. Furthermore, Pisaroni also has Niccol√≤ Piccinni's Iphig√©nie en Tauride with the Orchestre National de France, Mozart's Coronation Mass at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-Elys√©es, and Vivaldi's Orlando Furioso in Toulouse and Brussels under his belt, the last two with Jean-Christophe Spinosi. He has a keen interest in lieder, and has linked his living in Vienna with his love of Schubert. Among other composers represented in his song recitals are Beethoven, Reichardt, Brahms and Liszt. Personal life It was through his 2002 appearance in Salzburg that Pisaroni met both the American baritone Thomas Hampson (who was singing the Don) and his daughter Cate. Cate and Pisaroni were subsequently married and now make their home in Vienna.Picard, p. 6: She notes that, having settled in Vienna, \\"[he] believes himself to be mitteleurop√§isch by nature\\" Discography * Cavalli ‚Äì Ercole Amante ‚Äì Bolton, Netherlands Opera, Amsterdam (DVD) * Haydn ‚Äì Requiem ‚Äì Bolton * Handel ‚Äì La Resurrezione ‚Äì Haim * Handel ‚Äì Rinaldo (DVD) * Martin y Soler ‚Äì Il burbero di buon cuore ‚Äì Rousset (DVD) * Mozart ‚Äì Cosi fan tutte ‚Äì Fischer ‚Äì Glyndebourne (DVD) * Mozart ‚Äì Cosi Fan Tutte ‚Äì Metzmacher, Netherlands Opera (DVD) * Mozart ‚Äì Don Giovanni ‚Äì Harding ‚Äì Salzburg (DVD) (Masetto) * Mozart ‚Äì Don Giovanni ‚Äì Jurowski ‚Äì Glyndebourne (DVD) (Leporello) * Mozart ‚Äì Le nozze di F√≠garo ‚Äì Jacobs ‚Äì Par√≠s (DVD) * Mozart ‚Äì Le nozze di F√≠garo ‚Äì Metzmacher ‚Äì Amsterdam (DVD) * Mozart ‚Äì La clemenza di Tito ‚Äì Harnoncourt ‚Äì Salzburg (DVD) * Mozart ‚Äì Mass in c minor ‚Äì Langr√©e * Rossini ‚Äì La cenerentola ‚Äì Zedda  References  Notes Sources *Gazzola, Luiz (Almaviva),\\"Opera Lively Exclusive Interview with Luca Pisaroni\\", 7 May 2012 on operalively.com  External links  * on lucapisaroni.com Category:Operatic bass-baritones Category:People from Busseto Category:People from Ciudad Bol√≠var Category:Living people Category:Italian operatic baritones Category:1975 births Category:Venezuelan emigrants to Italy Category:Venezuelan people of Italian descent Category:21st-century Italian singers Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"Luca Pisaroni"},{"id":"16761157","text":"Birƒçna Vas (; ) is a settlement in the Municipality of Novo Mesto in southeastern Slovenia.

The wide band limit is assumed for both the contacts. Left: Traveling electrons do not have sufficient energy to excite a vibration. Only elastic tunneling can take place. Middle: When increasing the bias voltage beyond V=E/e (where e is the electronic charge), traveling electrons do have sufficient energy to excite a vibration with energy E. Inelastic tunneling can take place. Right: Traveling electrons can also excite and subsequently reabsorb a vibration, which leads to second order elastic tunneling. Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) is an experimental tool for studying the vibrations of molecular adsorbates on metal oxides. It yields vibrational spectra of the adsorbates with high resolution (< 0.5 meV) and high sensitivity (< 1013 molecules are required to provide a spectrum). An additional advantage is the fact that optically forbidden transitions may be observed as well.K.W. Hipps and U. Mazur (2001) Inelastic Electron Tunneling Spectroscopy, Handbook of Vibrational Spectroscopy, Within IETS, an oxide layer with molecules adsorbed on it is put between two metal plates. A bias voltage is applied between the two contacts. An energy diagram of the metal- oxide-metal device under bias is shown in the top figure. The metal contacts are characterized by a constant density of states, filled up to the Fermi energy. The metals are assumed to be equal. The adsorbates are situated on the oxide material. They are represented by a single bridge electronic level, which is the upper dashed line. If the insulator is thin enough, there is a finite probability that the incident electron tunnels through the barrier. Since the energy of the electron is not changed by this process, it is an elastic process. This is shown in the left figure. Some of the tunneling electrons can lose energy by exciting vibrations of the oxide or the adsorbate. These inelastic processes lead to a second tunneling path, which gives an additional current contribution to the tunneling current. Since the incident electron should have enough energy to excite this vibration, there is a minimum energy that is the onset of this (inelastic) process. This is shown in the middle figure, where the lower dashed line is a vibronic state. This minimum energy for the electron corresponds with a minimum bias voltage, which is the onset for the additional contribution. The inelastic contribution to the current is small compared to the elastic tunneling current (~0.1%) and is more clearly seen as a peak in the second derivative of the current to the bias voltage, as can be seen in the bottom figure. There is however also an important correction to the elastic component of the tunneling current at the onset. This is a second order effect in electron-vibration coupling, where a vibration is emitted and reabsorbed or vice versa. This is shown in the upper figure on the right. Depending on the energetic parameters of the system, this correction may be negative and it may outweigh the positive contribution of the inelastic current, resulting in a dip in the IETS spectrum. This is experimentally verified in both regular IETS and in STM-IETS and is also predicted theoretically. Not only peaks and dips may be observed, but depending on the energetic parameters also derivative-like features may be observed, both experimentally and theoretically. STM-IETS A change of slope in the current vs voltage leads to a step in the first derivative and to a peak in the second derivative of the current to the voltage. Keeping the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) at fixed position over the surface and sweeping the bias voltage, one can record a I-V characteristic. This technique is called scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). The first derivative gives information about the local density of states (LDOS) of the substrate, assuming that the tip has a constant density of states. The second derivative gives information on vibrations of the adsorbate as in IETS, which is why this technique is commonly called STM-IETS. In this case the role of the insulating oxide layer is played by the gap between the tip and the adsorbate. STM-IETS was first demonstrated by Stipe, Rezaei and Ho in 1998, seventeen years after the development of the STM. The requirements of cryogenic temperatures and extreme mechanical stability (mechanical vibrations of the tip over the adsorbate must have amplitudes in the range of picometers or less) make this technique experimentally challenging to realize. In recent years molecular transport junctions have been produced with one single molecule between two electrodes, sometimes with an additional gate electrode near the molecule. The advantage of this method in comparison with STM-IETS is that there is contact between both electrodes and the adsorbate, whereas in STM-IETS there is always a tunneling gap between the tip and the adsorbate. The disadvantage of this method is that it is experimentally very challenging to create and identify a junction with exactly one molecule between the electrodes. The STM-IETS technique was extended to the spin excitations of an individual atom by Andreas J. Heinrich, J. A. Gupta, C. Lutz and Don Eigler in 2004, at IBM Almaden. Specifically, they probed transition between Zeeman split states of Mn atom on various surfaces conducting surfaces coated with insulating thin films. The technique was later applied to probe atomic spin transitions of Mn spin chains of up to 10 atoms, assembled one by one, also in IBM Almaden in 2006, in a team led by Andreas J. Heinrich. The results showed that the Mn spin chain was a realization of the one dimensional Heisenberg model for S=5/2 spins. STM-IETS was also used to measure the atomic spin transitions split by single ion magnetic anisotropy of individual atoms and molecules. The underlying physical mechanism that permits tunnelling electrons to excite atomic spin transitions has been studied by several authors. Whereas the most frequent mode of operation probes spin excitations from the ground state to excited states, the possibility to drive the system away from equilibrium and probe transition between excited states, as well as the possibility of controlling the spin orientation of single atoms with spin polarized currents were also reported. In the case of coupled spin structures, the technique provides information not only about the energies spin excitations, but also about their spread across the structure, making it possible to image the spin wave modes in nanoengineered spin chains.

The original owners of the castle, the noble Hopfenbachs, died out in the 14th century. Subsequently the castle was owned by the Carniolan comital families Auersperg, Gallenfells, and Paradaiser, and the baronial families Tschernembl and Jankoviƒç. In 1827 the castle, by then in a dilapidated state, was bought by Baron Franz Wambolt von Umstadt of Essen. The Wambolt family carried out a thorough restoration, maintaining the Renaissance architectural elements and uncovering older Gothic and Romanesque elements covered or altered by previous adaptations. Before the Second World War, the castle served as perhaps the best example of extant profane medieval architecture in Carniola. In 1942 the castle was ransacked by the Slovene Partisans and locals, and partially burned. The abandoned castle was subsequently bombed in an RAF raid. State sponsored restoration works began in the late 1950s, but soon stalled. The remains have been deteriorating ever since. Most of the interesting architectural elements, including the renaissance arcaded hallways of the inner courtyard, have since disappeared. Hopfenbach Castle in 2020 Hopfenbach is a hilltop castle. The Romanesque square keep was first expanded with the addition of Gothic perimeter towers and the eastern wing. During the Habsburg‚ÄìOttoman wars the entire complex was surrounded with a defensive wall, reinforced with round towers. During the Renaissance, arcaded hallways were added to the inner courtyard and outbuildings were constructed in the lower courtyard. The final result was an extensive defensive complex, with two concentric defensive walls closing off the access to the main building, perched on the raised ridge. A walled garden was laid out east of the complex, separated from the main gate by a dry moat.

Ancestry and emigration The name of Siedle is not a common one and the few families with that name throughout the world originate from a family of craftsman-farmers in Southern Germany. There are historical references in the 18th century to Mathaus Siedle and his bell-foundry near Furtwangen, Grand Duchy of Baden. The family had skills in metalwork and clockmaking. There was a major emigration from the Black Forest (Schwarzwald) region in the early 19th century. The exodus of many Siedles was due to the number of sons in the current generation and also due to the state of political upheaval prevailing in that region. The Siedle clan exported their considerable skills. One section of the family settled in Wales and one in London. Ludwig Siedle, Otto's father, was born in Furtwangen. The family farm and metal foundry was near the Bregenbach stream and the property included the Siedlewald nearby. His great-grandfather, Hans Siedle, was the Mayor of Furtwangen. Ludwig emigrated to London, UK and established a jewellery and watchmaking business in Woolwich. Like several other members of the Siedle family, the UK provided a staging post for later emigration to the United States, South Africa, Ceylon and Australia. In 2008, the 257-year-old family firm, SSS Siedle, in Furtwangen, is an electronics company (Ref. 1). Life Otto Siedle's life is described in a warm and amusing book \\"Siedle Saga\\" [Ref. 2]. He describes memories of Furtwangen as a young boy, schooling in London and early training in Stuttgart as a watchmaker, followed by routine employment in London and participation in amateur and professional music. Then, because the Siedles were friends of Daniel King Junior, son of the founder of the Bullard King line of steamers Otto was hired in 1882 as bookkeeper for their Durban office. He made a success of this job and of many others in the new country. Whilst starting as a shipping agent. handling delivery of coal to the harbours, he became a director of other companies connected with sugar, tea, wool, glass manufacture, hotels, wool washing and milling. He made many appearances on the concert platform as a bass soloist. He met Cecil Rhodes in about 1896 after the Matabele Rebellion; Mahatma Gandhi in industrial negotiations in the 1930s; and George Bernard Shaw, John McCormack and other performers while in charge of the Durban Orchestra. His daughter was the opera star known as \\"The Lady in White\\". Two of his sons played first-class cricket: one, Jack Siedle, represented South Africa in 18 Tests between 1927‚Äì28 and 1935-36. Otto Siedle died in Durban in 1945. Comments of Others Rupert Ellis Brown, Mayor of Durban, wrote, in a foreword to \\"Siedle Saga\\" (Ref. 1) \\"Eminent citizen; doyen of Durban‚Äôs men of affairs; distinguished figure in the shipping, mercantile and industrial interests of our City and Province, Mr Siedle is something more than even these phrases suggest, for I think we might search the annals of Natal in vain for an individual who has been of greater service, of more solid worth, to the community than he. Very largely to his efforts do we owe the development of the artistic and musical amenities of the City of Durban ....his wife, Mrs Mary Siedle, who became Councillor and eventually Deputy Mayor, rendering her term of office historic by the foundation of the Durban Children‚Äôs Hospital.....Because Mr Siedle‚Äôs autobiography deals with his family as well as himself, and tells us something of their notable contributions to art and music, and not least to sport, the book has been most happily entitled ‚ÄúSiedle Saga‚Äù. .... It may well rank as a sequel or addendum to the late George Russell‚Äôs ‚ÄúOld Durban‚Äù.(Refs 3, 4).\\".

During this part of his career, Obama continued teaching constitutional law part time at the University of Chicago Law School as he had done as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, Senator Alice Palmer decided to run for the United States House of Representatives, leaving the Senate's 13th district seat open. When filing opened in 1995 for her seat, Obama entered the race. Eventually, his challengers were disqualified and he won the Democratic primary unopposed in 1996. He won re-election in 1998 and 2002. During his Senate tenure, Obama was involved with a wide range of legislation. While serving, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in the 2000 elections. In the redistricting following 2000 Census, the Democrats gained control of the Illinois Senate, and Obama became more active in his legislation, which included work in areas such as health care, labor, law enforcement, campaign finance reform, welfare, and community reinvestment. State elections =First state Senate election, 1996= In November 1994, U.S. Representative Mel Reynolds was re-elected to Illinois' 2nd congressional district despite being indicted for sexual assault and sexual abuse. Both Alice Palmer, Illinois State Senator for the 13th district Illinois Senate seat, as well as Jesse Jackson, Jr., 29-year-old son of Jesse Jackson Sr., showed interest in challenging Reynolds for his seat in the 1996 Democrat primary election. Jackson Sr. approached Palmer with a deal: the Jacksons would support her bid for Congress while she would support Jackson Jr. as successor in the State Senate. However, Jackson Jr. rejected that plan and insisted on running for Reynolds's district.Jackson and Watkins, p. 38. After Reynolds was convicted in August 1995 and resigned his seat on October 1, Illinois Governor Jim Edgar set November 28 as the date for a special primary election to fill the vacancy. Palmer, who had officially launched her Congressional bid on June 27, introduced and endorsed Barack Obama of Hyde Park as her successor in her State Senate seat. On November 28 Jesse Jackson, Jr. won the special primary election. Palmer, who finished a distant third, stated she wouldn't seek re-election to the State Senate and was undecided about again challenging Jackson in the March 1996 primary. Nominating petitions for the State Senate elections could be filed between December 11 and December 18, 1995. Obama filed his petition with more than 3,000 signatures on the first filing day, followed by a nominating petition by Ulmer Lynch, Jr. On the last filing day, nominating petitions were not only filed by first-time candidates Gha-is Askia and Marc Ewell but also by Palmer, who declared that she was seeking re-election to the State Senate after all, accepting a draft by more than 100 supporters. On December 26, the Obama campaign filed objections to the legitimacy of the nominating petitions of Obama's competitors. On January 17, 1996, Palmer withdrew her bid for re-election after almost two- thirds of the 1,580 signatures on her nominating petitions were found to be invalid, leaving her 200 signatures short of the 757 needed to earn a place on the ballot. The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners had previously sustained an objection to the nominating petitions of Lynch and subsequently also sustained objections to the nominating petitions of Askia and Ewell, citing insufficient valid signatures in all three cases. As a result, Obama won the Democratic nomination unopposed. On November 5, Obama won the race for the 13th Senate district, with 82 percent of the vote; Harold Washington Party candidate David Whitehead (13%) and first-time Republican Party candidate Rosette Caldwell Peyton (5%) also ran. =Second state Senate election, 1998= Obama was up for re-election in 1998; Illinois state senators serve one two-year term and two four-year terms each decade. In the March 17 primary, Obama won re-nomination unopposed, and first- time candidate Yesse Yehudah won the Republican nomination unopposed. At the November 3 general election, Obama was re-elected to a four-year term as state senator for the 13th district with 89% of the vote; Yehudah received 11% of the vote. =Third state Senate election, 2002= Obama won both the March 19 Democratic primary election and November 5, 2002 general election for the newly configured 13th district unopposed. Early Senate career On January 8, 1997, Obama was sworn in as senator. Early in his first term, the just- retired U.S. Senator Paul Simon contacted longtime Obama mentor, judge and former congressman Abner Mikva suggesting that Mikva recommend Obama to Emil Jones, Jr., the powerful Democratic leader of the state Senate. \\"Say, our friend Barack Obama has a chance to push this campaign finance bill through,\\" Simon said in a telephone conversation, as recounted by Mikva in a 2008 interview, \\"Why don‚Äôt you call your friend Emil Jones and tell him how good he is.\\" With Jones' support, Obama helped shepherd through a sweeping law that banned most gifts from lobbyists and personal use of campaign funds by state legislators. During his first years as a state senator, Obama was a co-sponsor of a bill that restructured the Illinois welfare program into the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. He also helped get various pieces of legislation that established a $100 million Earned Income Tax Credit for working families, increased child care subsidies for low-income families, and required advance notice before mass layoffs and plant closings passed. Campaign for Bobby Rush's congressional seat In September 1999, Obama and fellow Senator Donne Trotter (neither faced re-election that year) both decided to seek the 2000 Democrat nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives seat, held by four term incumbent candidate Bobby Rush. Rush had been badly defeated in the February 1999 Chicago mayoral election by Richard M. Daley ‚Äî who won 45% of the African-American vote and even won Rush's own ward ‚Äî and was thought to be vulnerable. The support of some veteran Democratic fundraisers who saw Obama as a rising star, along with support of African-American entrepreneurs, helped him keep pace with Rush's fundraising in the district's most expensive race ever. During the campaign, Rush charged that Obama was not sufficiently rooted in Chicago's black neighborhoods to represent constituents' concerns, and also benefitted from an outpouring of sympathy when his son was shot to death shortly before the election. Obama said Rush was a part of \\"a politics that is rooted in the past\\" and said he himself could build bridges with whites to get things done. But while Obama did well in his own Hyde Park base, he didn't get enough support from the surrounding black neighborhoods. Starting with just 10 percent name recognition, Obama went on to get only 31 percent of the votes, losing by a more than 2-to-1 margin despite winning among white voters.Federal Election Commission, 2000 U.S. House of Representatives Results Later Senate career After losing the primary for U.S. Congress to Bobby Rush, Obama worked to repair relations with black politicians and clergy members, telling them he bore no grudges against the victor. He also became more responsive to requests for state funding, getting money for churches and community groups in his district. Senator Trotter, then the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in 2008 that he knew Obama was responding more to funding requests \\"because the community groups in his district stopped coming to me\\". In September 2001, Democrats won a lottery to redraw legislative districts that had been drawn ten years earlier by Republicans and had helped ensure ten uninterrupted years of Republican control of the Illinois Senate. At the November 2002 election, the Democratic remap helped them win control of the Illinois Senate and expand their majority in the Illinois House to work with the first Democratic Illinois governor in 26 years. In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Health and Human Services Committee, after six years on the committee and four years as its minority spokesman. The new Democratic majority allowed Obama to write and help pass more legislation than in previous years. He sponsored successful efforts to expand children's health care, create a plan to provide equal health care access for all Illinois residents, and create a \\"Hospital Report Card\\" system, and worker's rights laws that protected whistleblowers, domestic violence victims, equal pay for women, and overtime pay. His most public accomplishment was a bill requiring police to videotape interrogations and confessions in potential death penalty cases. Obama was willing to listen to Republicans and police organizations and negotiate compromises to get the law passed. That helped him develop a reputation as a pragmatist able to work with various sides of an issue. Obama also led the passage of a law to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they stopped. In February 2002, Obama introduced SB 1789, which would have adopted instant- runoff voting (IRV) for congressional and state primary elections in Illinois and authorized IRV for local elections, although it did not ultimately pass.Record of Illinois 92nd General Assembly Bills He resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.
